0,I thought I had a good blade in my miter saw!  This is far superior to the blade I had before. This thing cuts wood like butter almost. Very smooth and very little splintering and tear out. Worth every penny!  I also bought the  7 1/4 inch blade for my worm drive saw and it performs very well. I am very pleased with the purchase.		I believe these are thin-kerf (I could be wrong) but I don't see any flexing of the blade. Not sure I would recognize flexing if I saw it!
0,What a unique way to protect your laminate & hardwood floors from scratches/gouges.  I was skeptical that these would stay on but they do!  Think of runners' compression sleeves that they wear on their arms & legs.  They are quite snug as are these chair socks.  They really do adhere to the table legs onto which I put them.  What a great idea; wish I'd thought of it!
0,Love the style and color!  Moen makes beautiful products!  Easy to install as I am a DIYer and it comes with instructions and some extras to get you started.  Just be aware you will need a P-trap and probably extension to install drain properly.  Also waterlines connectors are needed for hot and cold connections.  With the right tools, from start to finish probably 30 minutes to 1 hour job.
0,Excellent! Worked on my California PC 5-Gallon Cans bought at Costco. Good price. Amazon shipped fast. Semi-flexible spout. Use 1/2 drill bit to install air cap.		Note: I ordered a 2nd one of these for my Scepter 5.3 (20L) diesel can and it works perfectly. If you have the 5 gallon Scepter cans.. these are the spouts to buy. Shipment was FAST. Thanks Amazon!
0,Unable to find this on Gerber's website -- surprised to find it on Amazon.  Worth every cent!  Very well made.  Design is excellent.  Belt clip is very handy.  Highly recommended.
0,Very bright and love it is only an ON/Off flashlight..
0,These are sweet!
0,I bought this twice; first one had a bad sensor. Second one only one lamp lighted; returned. Very nice advertising for a poor product. Yuk.	Customer service replaced the fixture with one that works fine. I installed it, tested it, and now enjoying the security lighting that it provides. The customer service rep: Ariadna , was very helpful and efficient in supplying the replacement. Hopefully it lasts many years.
0,Loved the gold color produced by Rust-Oleum, compared to others feels like it shines more, and was defiant when layering with other paints.
0,This did exactly what it was designed to do. Worth the money to take any guess work out of the picture.
0,Installed these in the fixtures that light the treads of the stairs. They are very white light and I don't worry about the electric meter spinning around like crazy if someone forgets to turn them off. Great lights.
0,Very useful for drilling straight holes without a drill press. I have both sizes of this brand's guides, and both are excellent. Pretty much perfectly machined, there is virtually no wobble when using a good bit. One word of advice, is to make sure your drill bits are straight and true. Some cheaper bits of mine have a bit of runout, and that'll drill a wider hole, as well as cause more wear on the guide.
0,These cleaning pads or balls or whatever you like to call them are great except for their size. They are just a wee bit too small and I find myself using two or even three at a time to fill the vessel full enough to make it effective. I suppose that's not a huge deal, as you can easily "mush" several of them into one cohesive ball, but then that 10-pack turns into a 3-pack PDQ.  Other than that, they're great and clean my iron tips like nobody's business.		So if the old adage is true and size truly doesn't matter, then pick yourself up a bag or three. You won't be disappointed.
0,Perfect for monitoring your vehichels voltage, especially when you have added devices that can drain your battery. Great looking and good quality.
0,Awesome! Buy it!
0,My only complain would be it should come with regular nuts and not wing nuts.
0,This is a really nice shower head and feels really nice whole showering. I would not recommend it if you're trying to conserve water...obviously. But if you want a nice rain feel in the shower this is for you and it's very nice quality
0,Nice tool to have for iPhones and apple computers. Working fine for medium duty works.
0,nice use daily
0,This is perfect for all of the handy tools that you need around the house.  I originally purchased for my husband to keep all the household tools organized, but I ended up taking it over and using it myself.  I keep all of my essential tools in there so I can find them at ease.  it is an easy way to get organized and easy to carry around the house.
0,This is a nice timer set-up.  It does what it says it will do and has several options for turning your appliances off and on.  Even though it accurately recognizes your location, you have to adjust your time a couple of times a year for the on/off timer as it does not do daylight savings time.  If you've gone through the trouble of setting this up to recognize the location and day/night cycles, then why can't you program an optional daylight savings time into it?	  That being said, I'm happy with this unit and it is performing as advertised.
0,On time with the correct product.
0,This set has plenty different size sanding drums that worked pretty good for my needs.  The smallest sanding drums fit very very snug in the bit to where I couldn't completely put it on, but it was more than enough to not come off while in use.  The only thing I would as for differently is some sort of container sorting the pieces because the pieces came in individual zip lock baggies all packed in the box it was shipped in.
0,I actually ordered this to take the place of my shave kit.  I am currently deployed and needed something to hold everything, not just tooth brush and razor.  While there's no compartments inside, it looks and feels to be as tough as the original military tool bags that I couldn't seem to find.		I intend to order some for actual tools when I get back home.
0,Used for 2 seasons so far. No issues.
0,Nice Items.
0,Only wore once. So I work construction. My workbook is a 13 my tennis shoe is a 14 my muck boot is a 13 and is very comfortable.
0,Great quality, heavyweight, and had no issues with the screws threading.  Didn't need 10, but suppose having extras are not a bad thing.  Used these to replace knob-type hardware on a new bath vanity, and just drilled the extra hole.  Looks much better!
0,Work with existing pendant lights and really brighten up the kitchen. I bought 5 and all are slightly different giving me an artistic look while remaining neutral. Great price.
0,Works great and nice quality (brass rod, metal handle). The color is right on for matching most oil-rubbed bronze hardware. It fits perfectly as a replacement in our Toto Drake to go better with the oil-rubbed bronze bathroom hardware. I see no issues with quality versus the original Toto handle.
0,little slow
0,I love these tapes. The spring retract is easy and smooth and strong the full length. It fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. The readings in fractions is an added bonus. They are tough and durable. I've had a lot of tapes and many were very good but these are my favorite.
0,Works great.
0,Striker... It's sturdy, not flimsy plastic.  I have three starters all told. all different.	When you strike this, you'll get a good amount to start the fire.	I recommend it... When I first tried it, I almost set a fire in the house..	don't do that, not bright on  my part.
0,looks great. very high quality.
0,Works great, nice tool.
0,A client specified this stain for a table refinish job, and it met her expectations with respect to color/pigment. I used it on a maple-like hardwood from Asia, and it provided an even color. Top-coated the table/aprons/legs with wipe-on poly and there were no compatability issues.
0,Great light!

0,I wanted something I could install in my wall that would control the new Philips Hue bulbs in the room.  The funny part of the Hue setup is that it assumes you'll use a computer, or a mobile device, to control your lights.  I reasoned that some sort of dimmer on the wall would be possible, and easier for my family to deal with.  Also, I found that I missed that convenience myself.		My plan was to use a ZWave dimmer in combination with Indigo 6, which has a Hue plugin.  However, I needed a dimmer that would operate with no load, simply sending ZWave signals in response to user input, so that my Indigo server could listen and direct the Hue bulbs accordingly.  I tried a Linear Z500, but believe I was shipped a bad part that had been previously returned, as it was missing wirenuts and instructions, and would not pair (included or exclude) with any ZWave controller, even on a test bench with a live load.		This much-more-expensive Cooper part worked perfectly.  It has an LED display that indicates its current brightness level, and reports directed brightness to a ZWave network in correspondence with that and very predictably.  It works fine with no actual load.		That let me control not just the brightness, but the color, of my lights from a fairly conventional dimmer.  I have max brightness and full white when the dimmer is at 100%, and also most of the colors of a typical sunset as the lamps are dimmed.		Seems worth observing that while I am fascinated by this result, had a lot of fun with the project (except for the experience with the Linear part) and am very proud of myself, this did not really pass the wife test.  I got the old roll-of-the-eyes and an 'uh-huh.'  However that's not really why I put four stars instead of five.  The Cooper switch's dimming function is a separate pair of small buttons, with most of the switch's surface area devoted to the on/off function.  It looks nice but is a little time-consuming to use.  A slider would be a meaningful improvement.
0,I have 10+ Milwaukee M18 tools and I only had 2 batteries. So needless to say I spent a good amount of my time charing batteries. I bought 2 of these so I could spend less time charging batteries and more time getting work done.  I couldn't be happier. Amazon was the cheapest place I could find these batteries. I plan on buying more too.
0,We have had this lamp a little more than a year now and it is working well. It does brighten up the room and is nice to have around. The cat even appreciates it; she often will sit on the back of the sofa right under the lamp for her winter's nap.
0,This Dewalt Charger works great and it has many features that make it probably one of the best chargers out there. This charger can actually refurbish a weak DeWalt battery. It is compatible with batteries from 7.2 volts through 18-volts. Probably the best feature of this charger is that you can leave your battery battery in it without having to worry about the charger killing your battery like so many other chargers out there do. Mamufacturers of many chargers warn that the battery has to be removed after a certain amount of time to prevent damage to the battery. This is a terrible inconvenience and the cause of many batteries failing after a short life span. This charger has a tune up mode also that reconditions the battery after it has been in the charger for eight hours or more. Afterwards it automatically converts to trickle charge, so the battery is not damaged by leaving it in the charger for a long time. Another great feature of this battery is that it charges both Nickel Cadmium and lithium batteries.		Diagnostics LED indicators allow you to see at a glance the status of your charge. by looking at the flashing LED red light you an tell if the battery is charged, there is a problem with your power supply, the battery pack is no good and one very intelligent feature if the battery is too hot or too cold the charger will let you know that it is not charging till the temperature of the battery is optimal for obtaining a good charge.		As an added bonus this charger charges both types of batteries (L shaped connections and straight connections). The other Dewalt charger DW9116 can not charge batteries with the L shaped connectors.		I hope this helps every one in their search for a great Dewalt Battery Charger.
0,Flexcut has never disappointed!

0,Installation was a breeze, and it looks great.		Moen Rocks!  Lifetime Warranty says it all!		I would highly recommend this product.
0,I bought this switch for our 4700 CFM whole house fan.  This switch works perfectly and at a MUCH cheaper price than what is sold by the fan companies at a quarter of the price.
0,well built fast ship, good price,
0,I love these glow lights. Much more gentle than the LED lights there are so many of. They go dim after a few years of continuous use, but still worth the price.
0,Excellent
0,Good
0,High output and low price. Was pleasantly surprised and found out it included a blinking function that I did not expect.
0,GREAT VALUE, JUST WHAT I NEEDED
0,Replaced 18 year old locksets around the house.  Used this to re-key the new locks.  Easy installation and good function.
0,nice
0,Great little tool. Will be great stocking  stuffer.
0,These are some of the best flashlights going. Great LED light, with high, low and red emergency functions. Has a powerful magnet too. Very good quality, I have one in each of our cars, around the house and in our home emergency kit also. Highly recommended!
0,As advertised
0,It took me less than 5 minutes to set up two of these bloom lights this afternoon, including getting them linked to our new Amazon Echo. I used two Blooms because the TV is 70". Look at the finished product! The picture doesn't do them justice. The colors are clear and true. My television viewing experience is improved by these back lights. I want Blooms in every room and on the lanai.
0,I've tried several other timer switches on Amazon and these really are the way to go.  I've ordered six of these so far for bathroom fans, lights etc...  They work well just as a simple on off switch but are just as easy to push a timeout button.  If the switch is on continuously then a LED stays on.  If the switch is on a timer then a LED flashes and if the switch is off then no LEDs are lit.  Pretty much does what you would expect which you would think is obvious but it seems like this is the only switch that gets it right.
0,AAA+
0,The suspenders are wider than i thought, over an inch. Strong and handsome. Whenever i wear them, strangers stop me on the street to tell me how much they like it.	Recommended.
0,I have had this light for about two weeks and I really love it.  I replaced a clip on light with a single bulb that started having problems maintaining brightness and the flex arm was starting to droop.		This light has a much sturdier flex arm and being able to vary the light intensity is a very welcome addition.  The old single bulb light worked pretty well with my Kindle but with print books I was constantly repositioning the head to get light where I needed it.  This new light has multiple bulbs controlled through a dimmer and provides a good lateral spread of light.  That means that once I clip the light into position I don't have to move it again.  Even though there is a good spread on the light pattern it does not intrude into my bedmates area and distrub or keep her awake.		In addition to the clip the lamp has a sturdy and flat enough base that it may easily be used as a "table" lamp.  I have taken it into the bathroom in the middle of the night and it provides sufficient light that there is no need to blind myself by turning on the overhead lights.		It is a simple but extremely well designed multi-purpose light that will easily fit many functions.
0,It works as expected. It is simple, basic dimmer and with economical price.
0,I will give this product 4 stars for now, but I will update in a few months or so. I just received the flashlights. I loved the idea of a solar powered AND battery powered flashlight. It looks great, feels sturdy. I cannot speak to performance or longevity yet. And that's really what I'm sure people would want to know. For now, I was very pleased with what I received. When I've had a few months of use out of it, I will update the review. Maybe it's worthy of 5 stars. Maybe less. More later.
0,Love these. Excellent!
0,They came quickly and work well!
0,I like this tool!
0,This is my fourth UV LED flashlight, and at this point, also my favorite. I have a tiny one that only works for close up things, and a couple big ones that are about 50% brighter and way more of a pain to carry around. This one is small enough to comfortably carry in your pocket, but bright enough to use outdoors. At this price point especially, it's a great UV light that is convenient to carry around and use.		I highly recommend picking up a pair of the yellow protective glasses. UV isn't great for your eyes, and the glasses really help filter out the purple from the lights so you just see whatever is glowing. Though I received a sample for review, the opinions are my own.
0,Working just great.
0,We use these for heat shrink.  They work very well.
0,These are of high quality and much better than the cheaper ones sold at the plumbing supply store.
0,Lights are beautiful. They twinkle in unison and make the deck look beautiful
0,If you have a demolition project, this handy tool will be a welcome addition to your toolbox.  It is fully and easily adjustable, and will withstand a lot of torque.  The head is inscribed or slotted in such a way as to gain a good hold on just about any material.  It also strikes me that it would be good to have a tool like this for extrication if you live in an area that is prone to tornados or earthquakes.  It's too heavy to be of use for the Zombie Apocalypse.  For those purposes, spend the extra money for a lighter weight titanium bar.
0,Magnets on this flashlight stay attached to any metal without end problems.  You can hang from inside the hood to se what you doing in your engine which very comfortable than holding it.  LED are very strong.  Rugged finish. I droped it couple times and it still works.  You won't be disappointed.
0,It has worked great for us.  I wish I knew how the auto away worked, it knows when we leave the house somehow.  We have two dogs, Great Danes, so they are like humans walking around and it still does the auto away.		I love the app.  The energy history is a great tool.
0,These are great replacement bulbs for incandescents. They are bright but great for the kitchen. They dim well and don't make noise at low levels. They do go off at the lowest level. They are a little whiter light than I was expecting but still great for th cost.
0,Before you read my review (or any review, for that matter), take a look at the price of this set. Now, compare that price to some high end chisel sets. With that in mind, read on.		This Tekton set is great for anyone who has occasional, minor chiseling needs or wants a cheap, almost disposable, set to go along with the good stuff. It's the kind of tool that's easily replaceable. So, go ahead and beat it to death!		Note: This is not a set for fine woodworking. But, it's good for rougher chiseling needs.		Positives:	1) Sharp. Not necessarily precision sharpening, but this is a sharp tool.	2) Metal head. A metal hammer is not going to hurt the head, so pound away with whatever tool you choose.	3) Comfortable grip. The plastic makes this comfortable to hold, and the variety of textures allows a solid, maintainable grip.	4) Good balance. This is the type of tool that even someone with only		Negative:	I will reiterate that this is an inexpensive set, and it needs to be bought and used with that concept in mind. With that in mind, I only see one real negative.	- The shaft does not go all the way through. Although it would change the balance to have a metal rod through the plastic, and it would also affect the reverberation when hitting the metal head, I always prefer tools to have the plastic handle surrounding a metal shaft rather than simply connecting separate pieces. Personal preference.		Bottom Line: I honestly don't know how much longevity this set will have. But, it seems to be a pretty sturdy set. And for the price, these are easily replaced when they do give up the ghost.
0,These work excellent. Bright and super coverage! We bought two packs of these and then set them up so that we could walk from the garage all the way to the house, having these cover the areas where we would walk. As you were just about ready to leave one beam of light's coverage, the next one would trigger lighting the way. And in the winter, they are great for sensing motion of animals during the night. We also used them around our chicken coop to watch for activity at night and were very successful in spotting critters who were curious.
0,Fantastic product. I use one for my bar to illuminate glassware, and the other in my kegerator/mini-fridge which didn't come with an internal light. The fridge application alone is worth the purchase price. Extremely bright and crisp white LED light. Would definitely purchase again.
0,Well made.  Work great.  I really like the hollow shafts which make it possible to remove a nut from a protruding bolt.
0,So far so good. Installation was easy according to my contractor. I did have to return the faucet as it was defective, but they were VERY helpful and even overnighted me a replacement. I'm sold on this company!
0,It seems that every 6 years or so, the drill seems so less versatile and powerful than the ones on the market. So I scrap the old one and buy another. It's smaller, lighter, yet provides more torque and longer battery life, (and you get two batteries and the charger), and whether you're a handyman or just someone that wants the right tool in the cabinet when you get a honey-do to do, the cost is quite reasonable, and it makes a chore actually fun.
0,This product ROCKS!!!  Made painting simple.  Easy to set up, use and clean. Could not ask for more.  We have more painting to do and looking forward to it.  Spend the extra bucks, worth it.  Arrived in perfect condition and on time too.
0,A+
0,Nice, smaller than I thought. I'm using it to raise and lower my scissor jacks on my toy hauler rv.  I have a couple Milwaukee tools already.  I was surprised to find that both the old M18 regular Drill and driver batteries fit as well as the brand new heavy duty M18 batteries I had to buy because my Milwaukee 1/2" impact gun didn't work with the old original type.  They physically don't fit.  They are blocked with a tab.  But this tool runs on both types thankfully.	I used an older Milwaukee corded Hole  Hawg before but the cord is a little inconvenient (1st world problems) I'm hoping this will perform as well.  Sure would be nice if the description was more clear on the battery type needed.  I was disappointed after I bought the impact gun that my existing batteries would not work.	Hopefully I can update the review after a test.	Bad news.  It won't work to screw the jacks up or down.  It works fine with a drill bit in it but it doesn't like any resistance at startup
0,Worked great during the winter. Might be a little loud if your used to central heating or something else that's quite
0,Very comfortable, great fit, would definitely recommend and buy again.
0,Functions as expected.
0,Nice replacement and a LOT cheaper than B&D.  Seems to be working well.
0,This is a great product.  We wanted to update 80s oak cabinets in a kitchen, without spending a fortune.  So we stained using this, and added some european style hardware.  It looks like a new kitchen.  Very easy to use, great product.  I have attached before and after photos.
0,I  bought this in March 2017. The price at the time was $37.92 and now it's $55+! I feel like I got a bargain. When delivered I saw a few scratches on the blade which in reality isn't a big deal as I am going to use this knife. There was also a noticeable blemish on the backside of the scales which also Isn't a huge deal to me but, as these can be considered collectable, anyone who is collecting will/might be dissapointed. The grind on the blades is somewhat uneven which is also disappointing with Case's reputation. I suppose they are not made like they used to be but, still made nice with tight smooth action. About an hour with this knife and I can probably get the edge I want on them. Looking forward to using it and there is just something nice having a well made tool in your hand
0,I have bought at least six of these locks over the years. There are great locks and hold up well. You can change the combination to any four numbers ... that is a great feature.
0,Like all Lenox tools.
0,For being a Taiwanese ripe off a Craftsman design it works amazingly well. I have not real complaints at this time.
0,Excellent product. I have installed 7 of these and the 3000k light color is very nice for art lights
0,Great it almost dubbles the length of the welding gun.
0,will be next size also
0,great little cutter, not in the same class as a christy knife but close enough at this price.
0,Purchased on May 19 and arrived yesterday night June 6.  Note this only takes 18650 batteries.  So before ordering one make sure you have that battery or you won't be able to use it.  The battery it takes is equivalent to three AAA and if you have the housing that carries 3 x AAA it won't work because the diameter of this flashlight is designed for that one 18650 battery.  Another words it won't fit using those 3 x AAA housing.  It's very bright and has three modes.  It's an extra flashlight I wanted to bring on night walks and what I like about this design it's more compact.  That's the reason I bought it, aside from being bright, this flashlight has zoom feature.  Those flashlight rated 5000 lumens you can see side by side are brighter but not by much.  When it arrives, it's not going to be in a box, only a plastic wrapper.  So expect the package to get some beating but not to worry because the flashlight is wrapped in bubble sheet.  And does come with the strap by the way.
0,Great quality. Well made. Just what you would expect for the price. Great product American made. Delivered within a week of order submission
0,I love the new Makita 18 line of tools. I bought this one never appreciating how good it was going to be. It is an outstanding tool, that has more power than I ever expected. It can get into some real tight areas and has plenty of power. The variable speed control is really good if you want to baby something in that is sensative to torque, and on the other hand it has plenty of guts for the higher torque applications.	Brian
0,Switch was a little scratched
0,This works. It dropped the room temperature 8 degrees. It really helped this summer. It wasn't hard to install. The Squeegee helped.
0,Love this paint! Used to paint an old dresser and it came out so pretty!
0,Somewhat sturdy way to complement your camping gear. I usually have matches as well, but you can't depend on only one method to start a fire. Good price. Used this 10 times already without any issues. Would buy again
0,I used this pump to drain a 10000 gallon above ground pool and it took about 8 hours using an inexpensive 1 1/4 discharge hose. I figure that's between 20 and 25 gallons per minute in actual use. It pumped down within 1/2 inch of the floor before it seemed to start struggling. Can't speak to durability, but had no problem with this job.		Criticisms:	1) Has a 1 1/4 inch MPT outlet. Pretty much every discharge hose you can buy has a 1 1/4 MPT end. The pump really should include an FPT to FPT connector. Home depot does not carry that size, you need to get it from an irrigation supply store, which could leave you in the lurch if you need it on a weekend.	2) In order to place the pump in the center of the pool, the connection to the extension cord was right on the edge of the pool wall. Four more feet of cord would have made me feel a lot safer.
0,did the job...
0,These are great, but I wish I didn't have to buy 3rd party products to get my DeWalt working the way it should. Come on, DeWalt - this is a basic item!
0,Enough for a lifetime.
0,A great substitute for ladders costing 2X as much - particularly for someone who does not use it daily.  I like platform ladders vs regular upsidedown V-style.  I find the platform more secure.  The is my third platform and first of this brand.  It is well made and light.		Jim
0,What can one say about screws that are of the highest quality by Kreg for Kreg. These and all the sizes are the best.

0,Great stuff
0,The multi color option not only provides the ability to change single colors, but multi colors also.  In addition, it has a minimum of three LED's that illuminate for each single color setting for a brighter output. Six LED's illuminate when using the multi color option. When the unit is first plugged in, it changes colors automatically; you can then select a single or dual color of your choice.  If you want to revert to the automatic color changing mode - just unplug the light and plug it in again.  It will begin changing colors automatically.
0,We just moved into town, leaving behind our good well water.  We have temporarily been using bottled water and just switched to this faucet filter.  However this morning as I was washing dishes by hand,  I removed it.  It was really in my face as I worked at the sink and it has often been in the way as I reached for either the hot or cold faucet.  (It doesn't obstruct the faucet handles, it's just in my line of sight and hides them from view.)		It always seemed to be in the way when I went to swivel the faucet to one side or the other.  I tried the filter on both the right side and left side of the faucet.  It's nice that you have that choice but it didn't make any difference for me.		Obviously this has a lot to do with my sink setup, my height and my druthers.  I am keeping the filter because I may be getting a new sink and fixtures and may try it again in the future.		I was dissappointed in the taste of the water but I can only compare it with well water and the bottled water we have been using.  I guess I will get a pitcher filter and then I will know if a different filter actually results in a different taste.  It definitely removed the chlorine taste.		Flow is slow but adequate. We had decided if it was too slow for us we would fill a jug for quicker delivery when we needed it.  For instance, if you were filling a number of water glasses for dinner you would tie up the sink for quite a while.		I am giving it 4 stars because it seems to be doing what it's supposed to.  The devil is in the details.		Pros:	Went on easily with included adapter	Doesn't leak		Cons:	Filters not available locally, have to order from amazon	In my face	It says water over 100 will ruin filter and it seems to me that is likely to happen by accident
0,Wow, these are beautiful! I put one on each post and they light up the deck stunningly. Very impressive. Price was good and they all worked! I bought 14 and they ALL worked after charging. Its nice to get a quality product. Thank you.
0,this works perfectly for use with rainbow loom bands, it is really nice that you can remove the compartments.  you can take them out while working with them, or just remove some so that you can fit the loom in there.
0,A little bigger than I thought. Had to shift my hammer hook over but it actually improved ergonomics of my Oxys. Now I have a place for all my snap ties, jaw brackets, saw blades and beer (for home projects obviously)
0,In late 2015 we moved into a new house with a large 2 1/2 car garage, nothing was organized, everything laying or standing against the walls, so I bought some gladiator tracks and hook products for the walls and they are good looking, strong and organize / hold items well.		I have since added more track and more hooks to organize our garage even more, I can't say enough how happy I am with the products gladiator makes, they were easy to install, look great and most important they hold up to the test of time, (kids, bikes, ladders, tools, these hold them all great).
0,I didn't want to rewire my closet but needed some light in there. The motion sensor works pretty good once you get it positioned to work for you needs. The lights aren't as bright as I thought they would be but it does work. I will probably get another one to really brighten up the closet. I haven't used it enough to comment on the battery life but overall I think this is a pretty good product.
0,good value for the money  Stay on glasses

0,A nice sturdy little knife. It fits small to medium sized hands best; I think large hands may find it awkward. It comes with very sharp edges, and a nice piercing point. It has a full tang as I understand it- which is nice. It is not flexable at all. It feels like it would be brittle and snap if misused as a prying device. It's sheath is nice- but not made to be worn on a belt-it just doesn't work out. For a boot-the sheath would be fine. Really nice knife for the price.
0,excellent router table especially if you have Bosch router and you don't want full size table.
0,Beautiful sink, gets complimented on often
0,this set of tools are second to none. first class company no doubt.	But the case has no lid so the tools will fall out when you move the case. not fun putting all the tools back in the case.	WIHA can do a much better then this case with no lid ( thank you very much )	Thank You AMAZON
0,After trying a battery-powered, motion sensing fixture (which was far too dim for this purpose), I bought two of these.  They really do the job, providing plenty of light under each of two kitchen counters.  I used the included screws to attach them to the undersides of the counters.		The lens cover is pretty difficult to remove and reinstall, so I don't look forward to changing the bulbs when they wear out, but in the meantime I a very happy with these.
0,High quality, quite heavy.  Had to drill through tile with diamond bit to allow screws to reach stud behind. Definitely recommend screwing into stud due to weight of item. Had to buy silicone to seal back of mount to tile.
0,I have several of these pocket knives all over the house and truck and the main one on my keychain.  Worth every penny!  You also might want to get the Victorinox Dual Knife Sharpener, it keeps all of the blades razor sharp. It is in a pen shaped design and it is really easy to use.
0,This review is for the item, not the vendor. We originally had a Aqua-Pure AP101T Whole House Transparent Water Filter which worked OK for a couple of years, but degraded quickly and leaked out the top around the built-in bypass and around the screw-in housing. We replaced it with this this SS model which does not have a bypass, but does have far fewer parts (it's really three parts - filter head, filter housing, and housing collar). The metal does not flex as much under pressure, and the provided bar to help unscrew the collar makes replacing filters far less of an adventure. Mechanically, it is just far superior to the plastic model. One downside, is that you should probably have a bypass installed when installing this unit. Water can still flow through the bypass while you replace the filter (or if you damaged it somehow). This adds to installation costs. There is a supplied mounting bracket the plastic version does not provide.  But it is prudent to have the plumbing securely mounted before and after the filter.  The bracket is useful.  One plus - you can't see the filter, so you're more likely to either wait 6 months to replace it, or when water flow degrades. It might help on filter costs...	All in all, this is much better than the plastic version.		The filter works well. We have a tankless water heater and this pre-filter filters out gunk that would ordinarily be clogging the exchanger in the water heater. It also protects the tiny pumps in dishwashers, ice-makers and the like from clogging crud. We notice that sink and shower faucets no longer collect stuff behind the holes. A pre-filter such as this (but better made) is very worthwhile, IMO.
0,We have a small iron dining table and matching 5 chairs that all use these foot guards.  Over time, the original ones became brittle and shattered, and replacements were difficult to find.  The furniture is otherwise in great shape, so I was relieved to find these.  They fit perfectly and appear to be identical to the originals.  Delivery was prompt, and installation was simple.  Very pleased.
0,This piece is better than the stock one on my 109 craftsmen and was easy enough fabracouble a piece for  clamping. It was also realy nice to have the extra moumts for exrta tooling thats what made it a four star.
0,Pro grade stripper, cut hundreds perday still maintain sharp, then encourage me to purchase the next model Channellock 957, hope i won`t go wrong for 957.
0,Arrived on time and packaged well. Works well and did the job.
0,Works great. To address some negative reviews: 1. If the voltage of your battery drops below 0.89 volts it will not turn on at all. The flashlight is not broken. Put a new battery in it. I know this is not intuitive if you're used to filament bulb flashlights but this is a LED and that's the way they work.		2. Flashlight behaves erratically. It has an emergency strobe mode that can be engaged by pressing the button halfway down. That's the way it's supposed to work. If you don't want it to do that press the on/off switch all the way down.
0,Handy to have and a good assortment, nice price.
0,Strong magnet, fits Kline meter.  Cannot store meter in case when magnetic hanger is attached - does not fold back nicely onto kick stand.  The plastic peice that clips into the meter is tall so the strap with the magnet is too short to reach the opening that looks like it would fit the magnet.  Would still recommend this, just think about how to store it.
0,The chrome finish is nearly flawless finish, but you'd have to look very closely. It looks really classy on the wall. It's the perfect size for a smaller bathroom. It fits right it with other polished chrome accents.
0,This table saw made wood work really simple, everything on it is quality made and intuitive. If you're looking for something compact for the job site you should definitely consider this tablesaw. I spent a lot of time researching table saws looking for a good priced, yet high RPM blade and this one matched my criteria.
0,These guys are just what the doctor ordered. They are stylish and catrch all food from going down the drain and they clean up nice. I did not receive a discount for my review but I did get on a prime deal. I would absolutely buy these again if I needed more. You should get it too. The normal sink stops are hard to clean. Not these. I guess if you are a person that fills up your sink with water would maybe have issue with this. All others, get it what are you waiting for?
0,great price
0,Excellent light. Excellent price. Truly warm light. We're using these for everything from reading lamps to spot-lighting paintings from cannister fixtures. One is enough to light a bathroom for night-time use. Great for lighting my magnifying fixture for fly tying. Glad we ordered ten.
0,work great
0,Great plate cover - really adds to the decor of the room
0,Excellent!  I love it. No one will think it's a safe. Well constructed.
0,Work great to cut furnaces return opening. Love it
0,Got these for my son he loves them and I loved the price. Got them fast
0,Excellent Utility tool for the price.  It's not super high quality, but it will do you well if you need a utility tool and don't want to break the bank.  The best tool is one you have on you when you need it.
0,Fit and finish is ok for a replacement lock. These are not near as heavy built as originals but adequate for most lower end reno.
0,Excellent quality. Simple classic design. Matches Lahara faucets installed. Beautiful Venetian bronze Finish.
0,I bought six of these. They do not work with compact florescent or LED bulbs. The switches are a tight fit into the electrical box. These switches do not require a neutral wire connected to them. They look and work well. These may have to be replaced down the road if incandescent bulbs become unavailable.
0,I buy way too many lights.  We use a lot of book lights. Recently we purchased a loft bed for my daughter.  She has now begun to read to herself as well. Big Girl!!!!  Well, I got this lamp. It fits great on the bed.  It gives great light.  It might be a touch too bright, but not really as it is easily shifted to create different shadows.		I really like it.
0,Excellent tool. Helped with installing cabinet handles and made the job of marking hole location consistent and easy.
0,Liked it a lot . . .Was accurate enough for me but didn't use it enough so sold after a few months!
0,Appears to being a quality regulator, much than the one it replaced on my Craftsman compressor. I would have gave it 5 stars but the gauge is small and hard to read. I would definitely recommend this regulator.
0,Wire crimpers onboard  Most Excellent Electrician Tool
0,This type of heater is very efficient but is something that uses the thermal flywheel for its efficientcy.  It is not something that you switch on and off a lot.
0,Great Value and work well! Will buy more items from this company.
0,Best dewalt battery ever made
0,Works well
0,These knee pads are a cut above the rest because of the over knee straps both top and lower.  If you have any experience with knee pad you will know that if you are having to run and be active they tend to fall off..... these don't.  Buy some.
0,THIS IS GREAT, WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER.
0,Works perfect
0,Light looks great and installs easily.  I bought two of these to install over double mirrors and they look great.	I had considered going with the longer 4 section version of the same light but didn't know how it would look over double mirrors.  After seeing one of the I think it would have been an easier to install option, but I'm very happy with these lights, and they look great.
0,Works, no issues
0,These are hard to beat for the price.  Crisp, white light, and fairly bright, and at only 0.3W. I am now lighting up multiple hallways at a fraction of the power of one regular night light.
0,Nice...
0,Works as advertised. Going for a long time
0,Work great, havn't died
0,Very bright, and daylight color. Great price for LED, and the longest warranty. Replaced a CFL and now I have instant full bright again!
0,Bought a house with vaulted ceilings and a Hampton bay remote fan with no remote that wasn't connected to any wall switches. Works as expected, installs true to instructions. We decided to switch out the original receiver that was still connected, just because we didn't know how old it was.
0,The difference between this and the slightly cheaper ones you can get at home depot is that the screws have much better quality paint jobs on them so that they don't look as scratched up when you screw them in.  The cheaper versions tend to lose their paint when being screwed in.
0,Great little knife to carry on the keychain. Smooth and sharp, very, very well made. Not flimsy at all. Sharp and keeps an edge.
0,Great EDC Knife
0,This toilet seat is a little on the expensive side, but it's a really nice seat. It has silicon pads where it connects to the toilet so it won't wiggle.		It really is slam proof. Just drop the lid and it slowly and silently closes. The only down side is that you might get used to the slow close so when you use other toilets you just let them slam out of habit.
0,Fit my Craftsman 919.167700 1.6HP 26GAL air compressor's pressure regulator.
0,Camillus put a lot of energy and thought into this knife. The blade is based upon the Fairburn-Applegate design for a martial arts fighting system that has been around since the end of World War One. The balance and ergonomics are right. My right handed friends have no problem opening the blade with the lever button on the side. In my case I get it opened with my left hand in a similar fashion. The stainless steel blade is coated with a titanium nitrate protective coating leaving the blade a dark grey almost black color. The titanium side panels are checkered for texture, and do provide a firm grip. The blade opens silently because it has a ball bearing providing pressure, preventing slop. It does not need to be "broken in" like many lock blades do. If you were to purchase the equivalent knife from another manufacturer, you would pay double the cost of this. I actually own 3 of these because I really like them that much.
0,It weighs about 10-15 lbs with the crystals on it. Hang the light first then put the crystals on it. The review from Erin explains it all. It is a pain to install but damn it is worth it if u like bling. Extremely well made and pictures cant do it justice.
0,Use these all the time at work.  They are a great value for light assembly.

0,The build quality of the shower head is excellent, it is quite heavy and robust.  After installing this showerhead, the difference was amazing, the water comes out pretty strong but not hard.  It doesn't feel like your getting shot with pins like other water saving heads.  I'm ordering another one for my other shower.  The head is also a little quieter and doesn't sound like the water is being so restricted that it's going to burst out the side.  The 1.8 gpm flow is great but I'll be on the look out for something even less if it is made by the same company.  Some household members like to take long showers and I think they'll even take longer ones with this one.
0,Works like a champ. i have taken out hundreds of nails with so far and still going strong.
0,These are just what I was looking for.
0,These are 5 stars worthy gloves, I was under the assumption that they were insulated,other than that they are great,a few bucks cheaper than what one would pay at the store.
0,Worked just fine for me to work on my coffee maker. I saw some not so good reviews, but my set os OK quality.
0,I recently bought the Nest protect (2 months back) and really loved it. I like the idea of getting the notifications if there is anything wrong  (fire/smoke) at home when you are out. This helps us to be prepared if something goes wrong. I think everyone should have Nest Protect.		I am still debating about other Nest protects as the product still have some room for improvement.		Here are my two cents that I would like Nest to provide in the future	- HomeKit integration. If you are out, Siri should be able to tell you if something is wrong at your home.	- Better night light and should be able to customize it.	- In-built speaker would be really great as It already has a speaker in it and a wi-fi system. think about listening to the music on all the three different levels of your house.
0,Not too shabby.  The visible light component to its illumination is pretty bright but items that glow in UV do still shine bright.
0,Good product
0,Many other reviews not dimming limitations, so I was skeptical as to what I would experience. I am using five of these in a downlight chandelier, with an Insteon 2477D SwitchLinc dimmer.  I control my home lighting automation with an ISY 99.  I am able to set the on level at 1% (being the dimmest possible setting). With the old incandescent bulb, that would be the equivalent of the faintest of glows, perhaps equivalent to a candle wick having just been blown out - basically worthless light.  With these bulbs, it's still rather bright, but nowhere as bright as 100%. I sort of expected this having worked with LED bulbs before, and found that they don't develop an amber hue as they dim. Rather, the light is always rather white in color.  Other LED bulbs I have don't operate below 15%, so that this one goes as low as 1% is a surprise, and a good thing, because 15% would be too bright. I'm keeping them as the old incandescent bulbs would burn out every six to twelve months, so I'm looking forward to the reliability of LED.  Would have gotten a five star rating if the light would take on an amber hue as the bulb dims, similar to incandescent lights.
0,These solar light work so good, I started my parents using them. I had 4 light in use for almost a year and they work without fail every day. Since they recharge via sunshine, make sure you mount them so the sun directly shines on them for recharging. The motion detector is a nice feature to turn UP the brightness when a person or animal passes under the light and soon dims to conserve battery power for the rest of the night. Great visual assist for unlocking a house/garage door after dark. Two of our lights are mounted on an RV and Car Port gable end which are 12' & 14' above the ground and the sensor still triggers the light to come on bright when walking in it path. Go Green...Recommended Product
0,I have the bright/gold guard set of these for metric/sae and found myself needing odd sized metric wrenches more and more. This set has 7mm, which almost NO set on the market has, and the coating is great, it makes the wrench fit ever so slightly more snug (a good thing, less rounded out bolts) and the coating does alot more than keep corrosion at bay. My Sae bright guards are in pristine condition 6 months later with daily use, where I would have replaced many rounded off keys in a regular set ages ago. Very Impressive. Ive been in maintenance for over 8 years and will only buy the gold/bright guard bondhus sets, they are that good.
0,Great product at great price great manual and packaging
0,This little tool does a great job at pulling hair clogs out of the drains in bathroom lavs (wash basins).  It's the only tool that doesn't require you to disassemble the drain plug, and doesn't require harsh chemicals.		It cleans easily (use a kleenex to pull the hair off the teeth, taking care not to stick yourself) and can be reused.  However, after several uses, you'll notice that the plastic teeth are wearing off.  Then it's time to toss it.		We like this item so much that we are buying the bargain 12-pack and putting them beneath each sink for ready access.
0,Replaced my old Craftsman....this works fantastically!  Love the variable speed & easy to follow front-of-blade guide.  Great low price, too!  Didn't realize even my old blades work great in this also.
0,Fantastic set for setting timing.  I have a 67 Mustang with a 302, and this worked very well.  Set comes with a 1/2" wrench, 9/16" wrench, and a socket female-female adapter.	-PROs	-Finish was good.  Not as great as my old Craftsman, but good.  There were a few pock marks in the chrome, which will rust over time (the tool is Carbon Steel)	-Build and angles were perfect for what I needed		CONs	-Tool is carbon steel.  female-female socket seems weak and cheap, but not much pressure is required to turn most distributer clamps.		Since I only use this tool a few times a year, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  If I were a pro, I'd get something better, though.
0,I got some similar from China and being able to get it quickly via Amazon is a plus.  This one changes colors and is easy to spot our dog at night when he is out on our large property.
0,Work great once I figured out how to use.  Best description to using I can describe is.....strip wire shorter than you would think....probably 1/8 or less.  Take terminal to be crimped on and determine which size to use in crimper.  There are two sections that will attach to wire.  One being wire, and the larger being the insulator.  With crimper wide open place the terminal on crimper split between larger and smaller sections slowly closing crimper until it has hold of terminal.  Be aware, with the crimper upside down the part that will connect to wire is on right and the side that wraps around wire down.  Be sure that the terminal is sticking out of crimper as it will crush it.  Once the crimper has hold of the terminal correctly it is just a matter of sliding wire into terminal and squeezing the rest of the way....usually only a couple of clicks more.
0,we loved this product . It went great with our new doors we instalked. Easy to pull open!
0,I used the satin nickel version to paint the grill on the exhaust fan in the bathroom.  The metal grill was originally gold.  The gold was covered well with about 4 coats of paint.  It looks OK, but not exactly like the brushed nickel accessories.  The paint has metalic flecks in it that make it look different.  See sttached photo with the painted grill and a knob that is Delta Mandara.
0,This has proven to be a good adhesive for outdoor mosaics.
0,Great price for 12-Pack of really great bulbs which are brighter than the original 40 watt Candelabra bulbs that came with the ceiling fan.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pack-of-12-40-Watt-Clear-Candelabra-Base-E12-Torpedo-Tip-120V-Chandelier-Bulbs/dp/B00FWUTKWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">(Pack of 12) 40 Watt Clear Candelabra Base (E12) Torpedo Tip 120V Chandelier Bulbs</a>

0,gift for friend, he finds it helpful
0,It appears to be of quality construction and durable.  I bought it for my wife's weed whacker so I can keep both batteries charged.  I am very happy with the purchase.
0,Have several of the previous model for use with outside lights; this was the first with the upgraded Z-Wave Plus.  The controller did not pair immediately with my SmartThings hub.  I connected a small nightlight to the controller, plugged into a wall outlet and attempted to turn on/off via the embedded button.  After a few presses, the switch was manually turning the nightlight on and off.  I unplugged the controller, disconnected the nightlight and then plugged the controller back into the wall outlet.  The controller then paired to my SmartThings hub with no issue and is working via z-wave properly.

0,Easy to use! Crank is easy to turn and it has the flashlight working pretty quick. It's very good for camping since you won't always have batteries. The other side of the crank looks like a solar energy thing. I haven't tried that to see if it works. It's very worth it for the price you get it. It's packaged very well too. Happy with my purchase.
0,Daylight is the way to go. Fits right & is bright !
0,worked exactly as promised
0,If you are a They Might be Giants fan, you gotta have it to watch over you... ;)
0,Looks great and simple to install
0,Makes it easier to start holes in metal surfaces. Prevents sliding most of the time.
0,Great size for hanging tools on my pegboard
0,I got this AiRx Allergy filter for my parents, but it ended up being the wrong size.  I did not return the item though as I found another family member that could use it so I gave it to them to try and help them save some money.  They have reported that they are very happy with it and have not noticed anything out of the ordinary with these compared to their old filter brand that they spent much more for.		The quality of these filters is very good, same as the other sizes I've gotten.  I have noticed consistent great quality with every type and size of filter that I've gotten so far.		I got an opportunity to try these filters at a discount for my honest review, so I took the opportunity to get them for my family.  I've gotten some for dust, allergy, and odor.  All of which have worked great.
0,They really DO stick tight, without carpet tape.  Expensive, though.
0,A well received gift!!!
0,They charge and work exactly like the original, even fit in the box.  I'd shelved my old Makita drill because batteries were more expensive than a new drill.  Now I have it going again.  One thing about these NiCAD batteries is they deliver more torque than a lithium.  The lithiums are way lighter and last longer but you don't get the torque.  I noticed because I had a Skill lithium, great drill but I needed a hammer drill so I bought a DeWalt, and the DeWalt has way more torque than the Skill.  I noticed my old Makita also has more torque.  However, you can't beat the Skill for working overhead or long hours, it's half the weight.		It makes sense to have one of each type of drill around the house or buy the 18V DeWalt where you can buy both NiCAD and Lithium packs for it.
0,incredible batteries
0,Just what I was looking for,good light bulb for the price
0,the best!!!!!!!!1	great brand
0,Very sturdy and worked great for us.
0,I bought a house that needed 21 door knobs (amazing what people take with them when they leave). So, I needed something priced right but still looked classy.  These have a very nice finish, looks very clean.  They are much nicer than a standard/plain knob and priced reasonably.  They also have a heavy duty quality feel to them that the cheapest ones don't have.		Additionally, this is one of only a couple styles I liked and could afford that carried dummy knobs in addition to entry, bed/bath, and closet knobs.  It's also suprising how hard it is to find a complete set in one style.
0,Cheap safety glasses that get the job done, nothing else to say.
0,Superb pump.  Very quiet and kept the 30PSI required for the vacuum to hold the workpiece on my lathe.  I had to make some pluming adjustments to connect to the hose in a manner which it won't be interfered with the operation of the lathe and also to attache the vacuum gauge on a permanent setup to the pump.	Recommen for the use in the lather vacuum attachment any day...
0,This is the easiest installation you'll ever find... I've tried several and this is the best!!! Take of the old one and just slide this on and tighten. Install time approx 2mins!!
0,Best primer on the market
0,Old one had reached the end of its life. Nice to have a new one...
0,Great price for awesome stubby set , work great and have a nice polish to them.
0,No spatter burns!
0,This device is great. Its hard to know exactly how accurate but it does seem to compare favorably with test kits and another monitor I have, but this one displays down to the day, and averages up to a year. Radon levels DO very widely over the day. When it rains levels rise because the rain forces the radon up into your house. This device is battery operated, which I think is a great plus.
0,Good
0,Arrived on time, as pictured, and works great. I use this daily for room temp water and for water to fill pots on the stove for recipes that require use of the boiled water (jello, etc.).
0,On time and as advertised.  Can't ask for much more than that.
0,Really love it . It keeps temp just right .works good on cellphone .
0,I mostly bought this for the caps. They do a good job but you have to close them very tight, otherwise they will fall. I did try the finishing tool and it also does a good job, but I'd still rather use a cloth/napkin or my finger.
0,VERY bright!  Easy to mount.  Received 2 and just ordered 2 more.
0,Great bulbs for my lamp. The first one lasted a couple of years.
0,Fast shipping, Item excellent, was a little tight on blade screws had to play around with that, Benchmade  fakie no doubt but you get allot of bang for your buck and if you hard use it who cares and it seems like it would do well in that area, not as smooth as the the higher end but who cares its still an awsome knife. Get you one.
0,This is an awesome pocket knife! I bought it because I needed a good work knife to carry around with me but I HATE having things in my pockets. Especially of they are bulky items because I like to travel light. This knife is great though because it is a large knife but is slender so it doesn't take up a lot of room except vertically. Also when I sit with this knife it doesn't jam into my leg or hip which is also a plus. Blade and handle seem to be solidly made, black coating is well done, and the sharpness of the blade is superb. My new favorite carry knife.
0,I purchased the pads to go on my Porter-Cable drywall sander. I wanted to have the capability of using a finer grit sand paper when finishing a drywall job that I had to do.  The pads worked great and I have no complaints with their installation on the sander or their performance during sanding.
0,I purchased the entire unit and replaced the only one that had become faulty.  It was so much cheaper buying it on Amazon that just buying a replacement bulb at a local retail store was almost as much as just the unit.		The new unit arrived very quickly, and since the hole was already cut out in my Air Conditioning unit it took me all of five minutes to replace the old one and install this new one.
0,Like other reviewers, I can state that this is a truly great device.  The install process was easy (assuming you have a 2-gang box in your ceiling), the thin profile is a huge upgrade over builder grade models, and the built-in rechargeable battery is the sort of thing that we all deserve in 2013.  But the screen brightness on this thing is really nuts.  In my particular application (in a downstairs entry hallway) it isn't much of a problem, and honestly could be seen as a feature (an always on night light).  But for those who aren't interested in having their area lit by a bright-blue search light of a Carbon Monoxide Alarm, you'll need to plan to difuse/block the light, or  will want to look elsewhere.		If the light did bother me, I would have simply covered it with some dark translucent film.  But really, it is egregiousness enough that Kidde should really revise the product.
0,Great adapter for behind the bed! Thanks to this little guy I can now have 2 phone charges and 2 bed lamps hooked up to the outlet behind our bed which was before unreachable.
0,Just wish it had a back but it's awesome anyway
0,I have had some terrible experiences with airless paint sprayers. I have tried 3 different previous products. One had a tank that was so heavy your arm got tired after a few minutes, another had such a small tank you barely got 5 minutes spraying between fills and all 3 were between mediocre and bad paint results. My heart sank when I saw the plethora of instructions that came with this tool but it turns out they are written to describe every little thing you need to do to set it up, break it down, clean it and lay it away long term. In fact it is easy to set up, use and breakdown. I tried it with different paints and it certainly produced excellent results with deck stain on a fence, exterior cement paint on a concrete wall and latex emulsion on indoor wood paneling.	Here are some great features.	1.  You don't need to fill up anything or empty anything, it uses paint straight out of the 5 gal or 1 gallon can/drum.	2.  It has a long delivery hose so you don't have to move the tool and paint container very often.	3.  The nozzle can be set horizontal or vertical so you can choose to paint up and down or side to side whatever works best for the situation.	4.  One of THE best features is the nozzle barrel arrangement. The spray nozzle is on a vertical circular barrel with an arrow handle on top. If you ever have a blockage you simply turn the arrow to the reverse direction, point somewhere that doesn't matter and pull the trigger once and the paint is forced the wrong way through the nozzle and clears the blockage. This makes for very fast clearance and very few stoppages. I should add the pump already has a strainer on the inlet hose and the gun has a micro-filter pre-nozzle but it is still a fantastic feature that puts this tool ahead of the competition.	5.  Priming is easy and the pump only operates when output is demanded which reduces the noise and pump wear and tear.	6.  The whole thing comes apart very easily for cleaning.	7.  It is pretty economic with paint. It is the only tool I have used which gives good coverage and achieves the square footage on the paint labels with very little overspray and dust.	8.  It is fast. With a 10-12" fan spray you can paint very large areas fast and being airless it is not affected greatly by slight wind outside.		The only reason I took off one star was the volume of paint it takes for set up and tear down. With 20ft of hose a big gun and all the suction tube and pump it probably wastes around half a pint every use. That is no big deal when you have both sides of 1,600 feet of 6ft high fencing to paint, but anything smaller than a large room you would need to take that into account. You can pour the paint from the pipes back into the can but there is a lot of cleanup involved. That said I found this tool fantastic, quick, easy to use and does a good job. I am very happy with it and would recommend it to others for both indoor and outdoor medium to large painting projects.
0,These are good blades for the money
0,Bought the snapon version years ago. The real deal for less.
0,I am going to profess my love for this little floor lamp. I read in bed and although I have a Kindle Fire, I prefer to read with my Kindle Keyboard which has no back-lighting of its own. This requires me to stretch across and up in order to turn the lamp off that I am reading by, which can sometimes be extremely painful for me as I have Fibromyalgia and when I'm in a bad flare I can barely move.		I placed this lamp between my bed and my nightstand so I could read using it from now on. LED lighting is cheaper to use and I like the light from LEDs better than I like the light  that I get from incandescent bulbs and a lampshade. I taped the cord with the on/off dimmer switch up higher on the pole so that I could easily reach it without too much effort while lying in bed. I can turn the light on or off, or I can choose whether I want a soft light or a bright white light or anything in between. I also love the flexible neck which allows me to maneuver the light so that it is shining exactly where I need it most. This is a great floor lamp that doesn't take up much space at all and can be useful for many things.		I also do a lot of arts and crafts including silversmithing where many times I have to work with tiny pieces, so good lighting is an absolute must. This lamp will get you some bright white light right where you need it without being in the way.	It was very easy to put together. It's not a substantial lamp so it doesn't take up a lot of room and it isn't awkward like some floor lamps can be. I love it!
0,No complaints at all, I would think this was a new unit if it were not for the recon stamp.  Drill has tons of power, battery life is great.  The removeable handle is surprisingly useful and so is the built in LED light.
0,quiet!!
0,I installed the belt in myself and the cable was the right price and size. I have no problems and it is holding strong.
0,Works great, put them in my gazebo. I took all the bulb out first then installed the wiring around where i wanted them (make sure you have a ladder and make sure you can reach the bulb socket) then when got them where i want them, i then installed my bulbs, that way i wouldnt break my bulbs during installation :)	I live in PNW, and still debating if i want to leave the bulbs out or take them off again... since itll be cold out anyway. Lol.
0,LED lights are becoming more and more popular and are slowly coming down in price. They use appreciably less energy than incandescent bulbs and fluorescent bulbs, they typically are brighter and they do not suffer from the primary drawback that CFLs have - they come on nearly instantly when CFLs require a warm-up time. The cost is still quite a bit higher than with other bulb types so I have not made the full commitment yet. I wasn't even aware that there was an LED replacement for fluorescent track lights so I was very interested to see how much of a difference it would make. It has turned out to be much more effective than I would have ever imagined.		This is a full-length replacement for a 4' fluorescent track, though it is noticeably thinner which initially surprised me - I expected something of the same size. It is a lot lighter too and thats because it is not a glass tube but rather has a thin sheath of plastic covering the element. Without plugging it in, it doesnt look like anything special.		We have a 4' track in our laundry room that holds two bulbs and one of them had burned out so I decided to try this LED track in there. It installed effortlessly and because there was no glass to break it went more smoothly (at least in my mind it was easier, since I did not have to worry about accidentally breaking a glass bulb while trying to install it). When energized the room almost instantly filled with light, far and away more than the two fluorescent bulbs together could put out, to the point that it looked like I had removed both fluorescent bulbs and installed only the LED - even though the other fluorescent bulb was still installed and was energized.		The lifespan of this bulb is touted as 45 years, Thats an insanely long time and when considering the cost of fluorescent bulbs in relation to how long they last, and also taking into account the energy consumption of fluorescents, the cost of the LED bulb is actually reasonable.		When weighing the life expectancy of this bulb, the fact that it consumes a lot less energy, puts out a LOT more light and powers on nearly instantly, it is hard to find much fault with this bulb. It is significantly more expensive than the fluorescent bulbs it replaces but in the long run it is actually a very reasonable asking price (currently $35 here). Ill be buying more of these.
0,I've been going around testing all the USB cables that I have and I'm AMAZED at just how many are complete junk!  (And at how many that I thought were junk were actually fairly decent).  I wish I'd had this when I ordered a bunch of cables a while back, I'd have been able to reject the ones that don't work well.		The instructions that comes with the tester are in Engrish, but the device is easy enough to figure out.  Plug it into a USB slot, then plug in a cable connected to a device such as a phone or tablet.  Press the button to switch between display modes, hold the button down to reset the collected readings. Press the button 5 times quickly to set an power off timer (1 to 24 hours, or automatically turn off when fully charged), press 6 times to switch between English and Chinese.		The display modes are 1) voltage on each wire, resistance, temperature, time in use and current draw, 2) voltage, current, capacity, energy, temperature and time, 3) voltage and current in large numbers, power, capacity in Ah and Wh, and time.		By plugging in a fully discharged battery pack or cellphone and letting it charge though the tester, it can determine exactly what the battery's capacity is.  Now you can find out if your phone's battery is really dying, or if that battery pack is actually as big as they claim it is.
0,great
0,Nice made well
0,No, I am not a jeweler. Being retired(e.g. retarded?),I enjoy working and fine tuning electrical equipment, repairing small components, and tinkering with difficult metals such as stainless steel. High strength tool or knife grade stainless(400 Series) can't be worked with conventional steel files or oil stones. Those dinosaur days are almost over for me. A hint to serious users of diamond files: Use powdered volcanic pumice and water as an filing, polishing and non-clogging cooling aid. It is a but messy but soap and water cleanup is a breeze. I have also purchased a leather buffing/stropping wheel from Hartville Tool that will work with a electric drill or better still, on a drill press. This final step after using diamond sharpening tools will produce a mirror finish razor edge that may be comparable or better than factory finish. Klutzy people that handle sharp cutting tools should get good medical insurance. Shipping time was excellent, in fact two days earlier than anticipated. Mahalo!
0,This is a great place to start for someone who is just getting into turning pens! I did have one pen mechanism that was really hard to turn and was a little scratched up, but for $2.50 per kit, it didn't exactly surprise me. I contacted the company about it, and the promptly sent me a replacement.
0,all good
0,It's string.
0,This light is a very good value. If someone leaves the light on, it will turn itself off in the morning.
0,Put this blade on my crappy 9 inch bandsaw. Cuts great. Have been able to resaw wood up to 3.5" with no burns and almost no blade marks. Also works well for rip cuts
0,It's a good product!
0,Excellent Very ... and I found it as the site ... I advise inspect and deal with it
0,Great for small jobs, sometimes  the big wet dry vac are just to big to use in small places, this is perfect for me.
0,While it took me quite a while to figure out how to attach this to my bench, that was just inexperience on my part. It attached easily once I knew what I was doing. I have used it a few times already in my amateur furniture building. It's been really helpful and made the process of drilling pocket holes and securing pieces much much easier. I highly recommend this. If an amateur like me can figure it out and benefit from it, anyone can!
0,I was surprised at the size of there's because I apparently didn't pay attention to the dimensions.  But I love the feel and size of these pliers.
0,My favorite tape measure
0,Nice
0,Good lanterns to have in house
0,Fits snug
0,This measuring tape isn't messing around - there's no flimsy tape here that will bend in half immediately or snap the first time you press the release button. If you need a heavy duty tool for jobs where your measuring tape is likely to get banged around or dropped, this is the one to go with.		The numbers are big and bold for easy reading, and the tape of course has a locking button so you don't have to hold it in place once it's extended to the proper length. It's also got a sturdy metal clip for easily storing on your belt so you don't set it down and lose it during a project.
0,that is exactly what I ordered, it fits perfectly, and so comfortable. thanks.
0,Perfect for my 18' bass boat. Covers the whole boat, most of the tongue and most of the outboard.  Love that it's white so it reflects the sun.
0,Great Jack Hammer!!!  I have many hours on it (well over a hundred) and it works great!!!
0,Decent gloves, as cheap gloves go.
0,I used this to attach an emblem and a couple visors. It holds really well.
0,Works great....
0,Work great
0,Great little knife love it
0,Kershaw makes good quality knives in China... They have a great assisted opening feature, scary fast, with a satisfying click. If you do not know about them, you might think it was an illegal switchblade...
0,Not the easiest item to figure out, but it really does simplify the precise positioning of metallic drawer-slides.
0,Liftmaster products are always very good.
0,great for bicycle low torque bolts, and much safer than the click type wrench. It never will get stuck and fail to click.
0,Charges fast for that second battery
0,A+++++
0,I like the product a lot but there is still a quality problem, thankfully the Next service people are great.  I have bought a total of 9 of these over the past year and installed them at two locations.  So far, I have had two fail, always at some ungodly hour, which is disappointing but thankfully the Nest customer support people are great and both failed units were replaced without hassle nor cost to me.  The units themselves, when working, are great.  I can check both locations on my phone or iPad at anytime and when there is an alarm, I receive a series of emails notifying me that smoke has been detected and later that the smoke is clearing.  Cool if the units weren't malfunctioning :-)  With one of the failures the unit actually sent me an email telling me it had failed and needed to be replaced, not bad.  I will give Nest the benefit of the doubt and assume that the bugs and infant mortality issues are behind me at this point.  BTW, the nightlight feature is great.  Plus, they work in concert with our Nest thermostats to help manage the auto away feature of the thermostats.	.
0,I've needed this socket set for quite a while - price was just right.  Quality is excellent and the rack holder is easy to use and makes for better storage in my tool box.  Will last a lifetime with proper care & cleaning.  Size is clear to read on individual sockets.
0,very useful

0,WORKK GREAT, cost reasonable, 5-10-15-30 options are perfect.....
0,CH air tools are hard to beat for the home shop mechanic. Good quality for the price. I definitely recommend.
0,Very good, very bright. Low power consumption, no more heat from the halogen bulbs!'		The only issue I noticed is if you use a dimmer on a lower setting, the lights drop below 60hz and you can see them flicker like a dying fluorescent light.
0,Terminal bolt is 1/2"
0,The main reason I bought this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TerraLUX-TLF-3002AA-BK-LightStar300-3-Watt-LED-Aluminum-Flashlight/dp/B004VMWAKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TerraLUX TLF-3002AA-BK LightStar300 3-Watt LED Aluminum Flashlight</a>&nbsp;is because it uses 2x AA batteries, and advertises 300 lumens of light output. In contrast, the Maglite Mini PRO&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SP2P03H/dp/B007WKFHRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SP2P03H</a>&nbsp;I bought in 2014 also uses 2x AA, but only rated for 226 lumens.		[Mechanical Construction]	I prefer the body design of this TerraLux LS300 over the Maglite Mini PRO. It is thicker and more rugged-shaped. So it is easier to hold compared to the long, smooth body of the Maglite Mini. It also does not roll around too easily when placed on a sloped surface.		[On/Off Control]	The LS300 has a push button power switch in the end cap, so it is very easy for one-hand operation. In contrast, the Maglite has a twist-on power switch that requires two hands to operate.		If you turn off the LS300 and then turn it on again within 3 seconds, it restarts in Low power mode.	While the LS300 is on, another light touch on the power switch toggles it between Low- and High-power modes. This is a very good design. Most other LED flashlights force you to toggle through High/Low/off states.		[Light Output]	I loaded the LS300 with two&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/eneloop-AA-NiMH-batteries/dp/B00JHKSN76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">eneloop AA NiMH batteries</a>&nbsp;for testing. Initially I was quite impressed by the beam it produced. But in side-by-side comparison, its beam pales in comparison to that from my Maglite Mini PRO. (See the photo I uploaded for beam-shot comparison). The reason becomes apparent when I measured the power consumption later.		I should also note that the LS300 produces a non-adjustable wide beam. So it cannot throw its light as far as the Maglite Mini PRO can. However for close and mid-range illumination (such as walking your dog at night) it does a better job.		[Power Consumption]	According to my measurement, the LS300 consumes nearly 3 Watts when powered by a pair of fresh alkaline AA cells (3.0V). This is consistent with the claim of 300 lumens, assuming a typical light efficacy of 100 lumens per watt. But when powered by two NiMH AA cells (2.4V), its input power drops to around 2W. That means the light output also drops to around 200 lumens. In contrast, the Maglite Mini PRO consumes nearly constant 3W of input power, as long as the battery voltage is between 2 and 3V (See the chart I uploaded for comparison). This explains why the Maglite Mini Pro is much brighter than the TerraLux LS300, when both are powered by eneloop AA cells.		On the other hand, the LS300 still gives out some useable light even when the total battery voltage drops to just 1.2V. In this aspect, it is a much better design compared to the Maglite Mini PRO (the latter cuts off abruptly when battery voltage falls under 2V).		[Other Observations]	Front panel of the package says "Smart electronics for exceptional battery life and consistent light output", and "Dual Mode: High - 3 hr run time 300 lumens. Low - 24 hr run time 100 lumens".		Those claims are slightly misleading, because the light output is NOT consistent. It drops linearly as the battery voltage falls. So although the flashlight may start at 300 lumens, it drops to around 150 lumens as the battery voltage goes down from 3V to 2V. Furthermore, in Low setting the power consumption is reduced to 1/8, so the light output is 40 lumens at best (instead of 100).		[Bottom Line]	I like the rugged body shape of the LS300 and its on/off power control switch. I especially appreciate its power regulation, which is able to squeeze every late drop of juice from the batteries. So despite some of its slightly misleading claims (300/100 lumens), I still consider it a great product.
0,This planer rocks. It works so well. I can't imagine spending double the price would get you anything better. I have planed pine and ash and it just cuts right through it. Even the dust collector works great. The bag is small but it works and fills up fast. I hooked it to my Home Depot bucket vac and it pulls almost all the shavings from the planer. The depth dial is even accurate. This is a well thought out design and if you are a weekend wood shop DIYer, you should be more than satisfied with this. I am glad I finally added an electric planer to my tool collection.
0,I bought this because ours died. Same exact model but less hp. It was easy to install. If your disposal connects to your dishwasher don't forget to pop out the hole or your dishwasher won't drain. Would buy again
0,Great for small hands & it's a strong multi bit screwdriver.	Recommend.
0,When I moved into my new house, I was excited to make use of the new shed. But it had some misspelled profanity spray painted on its vinyl siding. No problem. I didn't even bother to clean the wall, and I just sprayed this all over one entire side. The spray paint came off pretty easily with a wash cloth. There wasn't even much of a residue, just an orange smell and some oil, and this was cleared away in the first rain storm. I still have a lot left in case we get another visit from our spelling challenged vandal.
0,Ive used the big saws before and this works almost as well. Have to cut a little slower vs a big one but it still gets the job done. Overall great saw.
0,The T8 T10 T12 LED Light Tube 4FT, 4 ea package was received on time.  Installed Led Light tubes to my Kitchen's  existing  30 old light fixture.  Two(2) Ballast was removed form fixture and rewired.  It took about 35 minutes to finish this project.  The Led tube Works OK without any problems and It much brighter  than  previous Florescent lamp.  I think , The Hyperion, Inc  produced good quality Led Light products.  I will give my Best Wishes to expand Led business.		SK
0,We bought one of these about 2 years ago.  It worked flawlessly until today when the hose inner tube ruptured. Since it is one of the best shower heads we have ever had I am ordering a new one.  Low water usage and great flow even with low pressure.
0,No play in the jaws of this range. Works very good.
0,good
0,These have worked for me in a tricky application -- I had been unable to find an LED MR16 bulb that fit into my late-1990s Halo halogen can lights (the gimbaled ones).  These are very sensitive to the front-to-back depth of the bulb, and all LEDs are somewhat deeper than equivalent halogen MR16s.		These bulbs are a couple of millimeters shorter in depth than other LED MR16s I've found, and they (barely) fit into the Halo gimbaled holders, provided the glass diffusers are removed (which I'm told they must be for LEDs).		The product loses one star because one bulb (out of 18) was a notably different color than others.		Regarding brightness, I found them to be plenty bright, but of course that's a matter of opinion, and I was replacing 35w halogens, and they're much brighter than those.
0,Unlike many, reviews I read prior to ordering this product, I was not afforded a discount. I own several Tactical flashlights. I have paid amounts ranging from $ 225.00 to $ 39.00 . As I am a firm believer in Amazon and have always been pleased with the service they provide and quality of their products, The bulk of my flashlights have been ordered thru Amazon. I would recommend this light set to anyone. I think it is well made and performs well, even at the full price. Probably would have given 5 stars if it came with a case. If you get one for writing a positive review, more power to ya! I am still searching for that " Perfect" light but would still say it's well worth the price. Who knows, maybe my friends at Amazon will assist me in finding my personal " Ideal Light" Get You One and Thanks Again Amazon.
0,Base was smaller than expected had to order larger vise to work with hitch setup
0,Replaced two tub drain gaskets with this part.  The original gaskets were crumbling.  Bottom of stopper said "Rapid-Fit UPC Pat #507 2461".  These gaskets fit perfectly, but with the wider part of the conical gasket facing down, the drain stopper doesn't go down flush with the bottom of the tub.  It seals and keeps the water in, I may just have the gasket installed upside down.
0,Excellent product for woodturning and craft
0,I bought 3 of these to use for some gates. They are not as good as the Sesame lock I have had for 20 years but I got 2 of these for what I would pay for 1 of those. The combo works well, it rains a lot here in South TX, the combo isn't always easy to spin when it is raining, but otherwise no complaints. They are much lighter than some of my other older locks, which makes me wonder how easy it would be to break this open, but They seem to hold up well and I am using them on a gate. If I was securing valuables I would probably buy a better heavier lock.
0,Easy to installed and it was working good.
0,Very strong and worked great.
0,Easy to install. Does the job.
0,They were exactly what was described in terms of color temperature and fit perfectly into the light on my over-the-range microwave. The light is much better as a work light than the soft white incandescent bulb that it replaced and makes cooking on the stove a joy.
0,This wrench can do it all. Works great looks good and the price is right. Feels strong I recommend it.
0,I love this little tool.
0,Love these so much we ordered a 2nd set
0,nice lookin bag for work or phone keys tools get a few
0,Great box to put electrical components in.  I purchased this to install my Water wall speed control and led controller in and it worked great.
0,Good product but very fragile. The light turns on easily when in pocket so that is a negative but it works well.
0,Absolutey loved how it transformed my daughters room
0,It does what it is supposed to do , which is to center the drill bit but it does get jammed up with wood particles.

0,Like all high-amp amazon AC adapters, it's a piece of crap that will serve you for 6 months - 3 years and then die.
0,I've had one of these Ethernet switches under running 24/7 on my home network now for several years and it's worked flawlessly all this time... still going strong even with constant heavy use.  I love the compact size, durable construction, and reasonable price.  I recently needed to expand the network into another part of my house and I purchased another one (now under the Cisco name).  It's identical to the old one and is also working perfectly.  I'll definitely buy another when it comes time to expand again.  Two thumbs up!
0,It looks strange, but I have been amazed with how much I have opted to use this over a standard crowbar. It is very handy and strong. The light weight is also a big plus to help minimize the weight of my tool belt. It cost a lot, but if you are serous about tools this is a good investment. I also have the other 2 sizes they make in this style: the larger 15" and smaller 7.5" bar.
0,Works well .  I punched some pretty hefty materials.
0,Bought this as a big brother to keep at home to my PD22. Identical to the PD22 but uses 2 batteries for longer life. Easy to use, extremely bright, very durable!! I carry the little brother daily and it takes a beating!!! You won't be dissapointed!!!
0,worked great!
0,I bought this for our RV because I got tired of hearing my husband fuss at us (me and the kids) for pushing on the screen to open and close the door.  THIS THING IS AWESOME!!!!  What a great idea!  It was easy to install, fits perfectly, and now we never push on the screen anymore.
0,works like any other needle nose
0,nice design... but not easy to put on
0,Works great, good price, not the best quality, but has been doing the job for the last 3 months
0,Some posted that these extensions are thin and weak.  The ones I got were strong and they did the job we needed.  Originally we ordered the long one but we found out that in some cases with some fans you cannot extend too far so we went with the shorter ones.  But both seemed of good quality.
0,Rugged. Works !!
0,worked as needed!
0,I do so many crafts and lot of them are wood.  This sander has been a real asset to my work.  Love how easy the sand paper fits and stays in place.  It only uses 1/4 sheet so I can buy the larger ones and save money, just have to cut in half and then in half again.  I'm loving the fact it is	Black and Decker.  Always get my moneys worth with Black and Decker product.
0,This is not the "end all be all" knife. It is not a knife to brag about to your friends, though if you want to brag about a knife you probably don't have many friends. This knife is the perfect "Use,  Bruise and Lose" pocket knife. It is small enough to fit unnoticeabley in your pocket but feels large once deployed. There is sufficient jimping and the flipper in combination with the spring assist makes the blade deploy extremely fast. Overall quality is superb even though it is a China knife. I've had mine for months and use it every day for random cutting. That's what it is best for, not some extremely large combat knife or a delicate collectable, it is a workhorse. Not fancy with frills or useless features, but instead a solid inexpensive every day carry option that you will not regret. Bumps and bruises? Bring it on...
0,The correct replacement for my broken one, convenient to buy, quick delivery and at the right price.
0,Really, the standard by what all other pliers are judged. The problem is keeping them from being stolen by your friendly employees. I tag them with colored tape and engrave a name. Still, it's the age old issue of finding them when you need them. I need 3 or 4 pair to keep one available. That's life.
0,Fantastic light!
0,It works great. What else to say?
0,True story--I accidentally left one of these (from a three-pack, actually) in my carry-on bag during a trip this week to Miami. Took it onto four different planes (Fort Wayne, Chicago, Miami, Dallas). Didn't discover it until returning, hidden there at the bottom of one of the zipped pockets, and I about freaked out when I saw it this morning.		The thing is heavy and all metal, and the TSA didn't see it. I coulda been slammed on the floor and forced into an orange jumpsuit.		So thank you, Husky utility knife, for whatever you did to stay incognito!
0,Great buy for the money!
0,There are several reviews on the taste so I won't go into that. They taste fine and are actually pretty good if you are hungry.		So I decided I was going to really try this product out and see what it would be like if I really had to live off one of these for 3 days. I'm a 205lb male, my job keeps me on my feet but it isn't typically strenuous. I worked two 12 hour shifts during my 3 days and did 40 minutes of moderate cardio each day (heart rate about 150 burning about 500 calories each session).		During the 3 days I only ate these bars and drank non-nutritive fluids (water tea and coffee). I felt pretty hungry all the time but never felt weak or starved. These will get you by but its not a happy journey. I am down about 5lbs after the 3 days. Some of that is probably water weight, but a guy my size eating 1200 calories a day is going to lose weight. All in all the product does exactly what it should, keeps you alive and functioning for 3 days.		In an emergency I would be glad to have these. I will probably buy a few more of these to keep on hand.
0,Good stuff, fast delivery, accurate description of what the produce is, this is the first time I purchased this product and it will not be the last if I need another. It all plastic so far it's holding up but only time will tell.
0,Best drill bit I ever bought! ill be buying many more in different sizes. the screw tip makes for simple drilling. would recommend to all that's looking for an amazing drill bit
0,a little stiff to open and close with out key. Probably just needs to be used and broken in, got it to use in my impact driver so I don't have to buy special drill bits.
0,The lights are very good, but if used outdoors inspect the face cover of the lamp because on some of them water can leak inside the LED and ruin the lamp, otherwise, no problem so far
0,Good product. They heat quick and evenly, take tinning and preform as stated. Decent tips for soldering at an affordable price.
0,These are fun, and they give an awesome spectrum of light; but the bridge is a bit finicky when updating and the range on them isn't all that great. We bought these to integrate with our Echo and the number of time the devices disconnect from each other has become a little bit annoying. The lighting effects are nice when they work and we enjoy being able to control the lights from our mobile devices and with our voice (when it works); but hopefully the system becomes for stable with future updates and more features continue to become available.
0,These things are simply amazing.  Plenty of power for the little 8v applications, incredibly fast to recharge, and will not discharge in storage.  Fast recharge suggests that it might not be necessary to own an extra, but it irks me have to stop mid-course, so I ordered this second as a "just in case" backup.
0,I purchased these bulbs for an over the range microwave that used traditional bulbs that got really hot and melted the plastic covers after many years. These bulbs are VERY bright at the high setting. My fixture has a low and high. The low setting doesn't work well with these bulbs (barely lit), but we just just the high setting and are very pleased with the performance.
0,Good product
0,Good saw.
0,We are using this to turn on a fan above a gas heater in our shop. I mounted an outlet up near the ceiling to plug this unit in and it works great. It kicks the fan on shortly after the heater comes on and quickly after it stops producing heat. Nice to not have the fan running constantly and circulating cold air. The array of features this unit has gives you plenty of options for use in heating or cooling.
0,I have never used anything like this product before and wasn't completely sure even what to look for.  My cheaply made kitchen cabinetry have had drawers that haven't tracked well for years.  As I was finally having my cabinets refinished (long overdue) I decided to empty out the silverware drawer and see what wasn't working right.  I really only needed to replace the plastic grip that attaches to the back of the drawer but this kit contains everything, and for under $4!  So I just went ahead and ordred several.  It was very easy to screw on the new grip and now the drawer glides as well as it ever did. I can't say how easy it would be to add drawer glides where there had been none, but I suspect it would not be too hard. Good directions, shipped quickly, excellent price. I'm very happy.
0,I am very pleased with this purchase. I really wanted a light over a door from my garage to the outside because that is where our trash cans are stored. I was tired of using my iPhone as a light source trying to fumble around to throw trash away at night. I wasn't sure if I could use a solar powered light source there though because that wall faces north and never has direct sunlight. I was very pleasantly surprised that the indirect lighting was enough to charge this. I was also very happy with the light output and the motion detection area. I'm very happy to say that my trash can problem is solved. I just need to choose where to place the other three now.
0,works great
0,Bit works great. Dose not come in a wood box like some of thete other sets.
0,so far battery holds up - charger dose my other batterys
0,bright clamp holds well worth the $$
0,Very good
0,The light arrived in a sturdy box with all internal parts very well protected with various packing materials.  The toggle bolts supplied hold the backing plate securely to the wall.  Like others suggested, I used a few pieces of masking tape to secure the wires to the back of the fixture center area to keep them out of the way during final assembly.  I also used a suggestion to modify a caulking tube to fit the nuts that hold the globes in place.  It only took a slight modification to make the diameter of the end of the used caulking tube slightly smaller to hold the nuts securely and use the length of the caulking tube as an extended wrench to quickly install all of the globes.  I mounted the globes facing down and inserted 300K LED bulbs.  Very good quality overall and looks great in my renovated bathroom.
0,Great looking hardware.  Great price!
0,These prolong the life of both sets of my oxy bags.
0,Great knives-bought 1 for all my children for Christmas
0,Really Nice....
0,Worked fine w/the Hunter fan purchased.
0,Easy to install and align.
0,I tiled a dining area with Armstrong VCT tile and these are perfect for the table & chair legs. The legs are wood and the adhesive seems to be holding fine though theres little movement on the chairs and none on the table. I went through 42 for a table and 4-chairs and will buy some more for a few other items in the room but they are cheaper at the orange home center. I cant see these falling off unless they catch on something like a floor seam but they are definitely best suited for a very smooth floor. No complaints and they're much better than the metal ones that I had hammered into the legs and they're quiet when sliding a chair. I paid a few pennies more than 5-bucks for these and now that they've been on for awhile I've had to glue some back on with clear Silicon adhesive but still no complaints based primarily on the low cost.
0,very good  i like
0,Bright and has a quick response to turn on
0,Absolutely love this.  Time saver and headache saver.
0,works as described good price
0,These bulbs are bright and great.  Worth the time converting the fixture!
0,I use exclusively these filters, plus hepa filters in my bedroom , to turn my house into an oasis from allergies.		Set up the auto redelivery option it's worth it.
0,I love solar lights. Its convinient and also power saver. Since christmas around the corner i was able to received the product at discounted price in return of my hones opinion and review. The package came in so well no damage at all. There are two working modes, steady mode and flashing mode, and also can be switched easily by using the mode button. Power On/Off (After switch turned on, can automatic light control and charging) The working time of the solar lights is 6-8hours illumination at night after fully charged during the day. Make sure that the charge it for the 6 hours under the sunlight directly when you first using the lights to ensure the lights will working properly. And also theel solar light string outdoor are waterproof designed products, so they will not be affected when using during rainy day or moist environment, suitable for outdoor application.
0,Yeah, we've had a good experience with these decals.  They stick nicely, don't ruin the paint, and have lasted us over a year.  We've moved every decal from one wall to another wall, and then to another wall in another bedroom.  They keep on sticking!
0,Does the job, no leaks so far. I replaced several older connectors (3 ball type) that were becoming a problem when connecting/disconnecting.	It would probably help if, occasionally, a drop of oil is rubbed on the balls to assist with connections.
0,It Works. Able to still use my 18v tools still without wasting money on outdated and over priced 18v batteries.
0,The tape is really sticky. Easy to use. It's a good product. Reasonably priced.
0,Beautiful design, beautiful product. Thank you.
0,I searched high and low for a large LED globe lightbulb that actually gives off light like a normal bulb. I found this item and my search was over. came nicely packaged as well. Now I can come up with even better ideas with a lightbulb like this over my head.
0,so far so good.  like a new mower with a sharp blade.  will correct review if anything unexpected comes along but for  now fine
0,Very solid ratchet. The reverse lever functions smoothly and locks in with a click. The release button for sockets works effortlessly, and when putting sockets on, you can hear an audible "click". The length of the handle is just right for leverage and overall thickness and contour is great for fitting in the palm if your hand. This is a well designed and well built little ratchet. I highly recommend it. GJM
0,WORKING LIKE A CHAMP
0,My wife is on a mission.		She hates when people don't turn off the light when leaving a room.  She's also very good at making the rounds of the house, turning off lights, and making sure the perpetrator knows her displeasure. She may be Empress Of The Light Switch, but even a dumb husband like me knows that it's frustrating.  So that's why I call this the Marriage Saver (tm).		It's easy to install, though make sure you have a neutral wire in your switch bracket.  It pretty much just dropped right into the old light switch bracket (turn off the power first though, OK?) and was common sense.  My main issue is with the module...I had to rearrange some wiring inside the bracket because the module is fairly thick and takes up more room than a standard switch.  I also don't like how you need to use dip switches to set the various modes and things.  Fortunately you can adjust the dips after the switch is installed, but it's still kind of a pain and you need to keep the instruction sheet handy so you know what the various dip settings are.		I really like the detection angle on this.  My brother has a similar switch in his house, but the coverage on it is only 90 degrees, which is kind of a mismatch for the room...you can walk into the room and you have to go in several feet before you're detected.  With this device, it picks you up a lot quicker.  Another difference is that with his, if you're sitting still for a couple of minutes, the switch won't detect you and turn off.  This device, at least so far, hasn't had that problem for me.  I don't know if it's a function of how the sensor works or what, but it hasn't turned off for me while still in the room.  This is in an office space where I'm often semi-motionless in front of the computer, so it's not like I'm not trying.		So it works and it's made The Empress a little less fussy when it comes to the lights in one of our rooms.  It does take up one full standard bracket though, so this won't work on a multi-switch installation.  For replacing a single switch in a room though, well, it does what it's supposed to do.
0,Super good.  Powerful.
0,Cuts like butta! I have used this on steel and aluminum, and I am not disappointed. I am no professional and I haven't used it much, so my experience does not reflect longevity.
0,I really Love these pulls!  Heavy duty and nice looking!  Very pleased
0,No one does it better than Forrest. No one.
0,Produced chip free cuts ,is well made, and very affordable.
0,I was totally surprised as how many bulbs there are~~~!!!!!~~~~ Absolutely 100% A GREAT BUY~~~
0,This is one of those, dang that's expensive tools that pays for itself the first time you use it.  It also can be the one that grows legs the fastest, so mine is a beautiful pink now on the metal portion.  It takes care of most holes you will run into during a rough or trim of an electrical project and is sharp.  Its a Klein, just order it, you will have it for years, pink or not.
0,Plastic but sturdy. Good for broken shower part.
0,Nice finish
0,This tool is great.  It fits into places the other Pex tools can't.  The down side is that is is only for 1/2 inch Pex and most of the other tools will accommodate 3/4 inch as well.  It was perfect for what I needed.  It is sturdy and well built and should last for manuy DIY jobs around the house, my rent houses and the ranch.
0,Very handy item! Lets you know if your chargers are at the correct voltage, and also see how much current is being drawn.	A lot of items are hazy on how much they draw (especially fans, rechargeable flashlights, etc.), and this shows you right off, so that you know if you have a charger/device mismatch.	Also, on rechargeable items, you can see the current going down as they are charging up, so you can make a good guess at how much time to finish the charging.
0,Needed one of these as I lost one. My Workmate is over 20 years old (love the durability).  I was a b it concerned as some of the review stated these did not fit in some of the older ones.  Not the case with mine.  Fit perfectly (a little tighter than the originals).  These are  sturdier that the originals. I have not actually used them yet,  but am sure these replacement are as good as the originals,  if not better.
0,This BRIGHT YELLOW outdoor extension cord is perfect! So bright, you won't trip over it on the grass or dirt, Lighted plug end tells you both it is plugged in, and you can find the plug in dim light!  It rolls up easily and since we use it for outdoor heavy duty electric tools every day, it seems as if it is brand new. Great Value! Buy It for Highest Quality!
0,in summertime this hat works great with sun visors.
0,The hardest thing about working outdoors is keeping up with your dang gloves.  Did I put them in my jacket pocket?  Are they on the sawhorses?  Who knows?  Now I do; they're right here hooked to my belt.  Save time and sanity with this genius little helper.
0,I was a little sceptical about the product when I 1st ordered it. But I figured for the size and price it would be worth checking it out.	Now I find myself using this more than any of my other keychain tools, and I have many.	It is so simple to access as it clips on and off of the keychain so easily. I use this as my primary package opener. Not so sharp that you have to worry about it damaging the package contents.... or jabbing  yourself with it. But sharp enough to open the package without exerting much effort.  I also use it on a regular basis as my split ring tool. The beveled edge for the package opener fits perfectly into any size split ring and the small size of the doohickey makes it very easy to handle and maneuver.	I am glad I decided to buy it  and give it a chance as I use it so frequently now
0,Works well
0,This was very easy to install and it works perfectly. I couldn't be happier with this product.
0,THIS IS THE BEST THINK THEY CAME OUT WITH  2 WALL PLUGS YOU CAN PLUG IN SIX PLUGS OR POWER ADAPTERS.
0,I've always been a Porter Cable snob when it comes to power hand tools.  Their merger with DW/BD made me consider other brands, however.  This isn't to bash PC or DeWalt, who still haven't disappointed me, but it opened the door to my considering a Milwaukee.  There's not a good reason for that, mind you, but it's how things played out...		I was building a deck, and there was serious demolition in my future.  Took a long hard look at the PC recip saws.  They looked good... they felt good... take a look at how much I love my PC sidewinder in another review here.		And yet - was there room in my shop for something that wasn't gray (or blue, for floor-tools)?  Only one way to find out: I had to try the Big Red "Sawz Everything."		No regrets.  Not one.  I'm a bit concerned at some of the issues or reliability that are raised here, but I haven't had any problems and I've used the saw quite a bit.		Blade change is a cinch.  Can be done with one hand, no tools, in about 3 seconds (with your other hand holding the unplugged saw, obviously).  I routinely use the blade "mounted backwards" whenever I need different clearance - a great feature.  Adjustable shoe is awesome, and could not be easier to set.  Variable speed via trigger, with top speed set by dial.  Again, as intuitive as possible.		Comfortable to hold, and the replaceable power cable is a great idea.  Not that I've sawed through mine, but I can see how it could happen - and it's nice knowing that a replacement is just a twist/pull away, if the need ever arises.		I've cut through 1.25" EMT conduit, hardwoods, softwoods, nails, screws, and combinations thereof.  The saw never bogs down.		I'm not sure what else you could put into a saw like this.  Adjustable stroke, adjustable shoe, quick-change blade, reversible blade, variable speed, comfortable design, and all changes are intuitive and easy.		Assuming that the reliability issues mentioned here are a fluke, this is the ultimate recip-saw.
0,Super lightweight, hold on well, and have a decent tine. These are a little tight behind the ears, though.
0,thank you
0,Good Quaility.
0,Bought this after taking a home defense class.  Keep it in the bedroom so you can keep an intruder out and give you time to call the police.
0,Arrived as expected.  Works great for small 1 gallon paints needs to be sturdier for mixing grout and length could be longer.
0,This vice is the bomb folks!  I've never seen or used one that feels as well made.  I've only used it in a few projects so far but it has done very well on each task showing basically no wear.  I broke my last vice trying to thread an iron pipe and this one nailed that job immediately.  The operation is smooth and easy.  I also bought the soft jaws for it (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yost-Vises-MR-350-5-34-Magnetic-Aluminum-Vise-Jaw-Caps-with-Rubber-Finish-1-Pair/dp/B00E9AANUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yost Vises MR-350 5" Magnetic Aluminum Vise Jaw Caps with Rubber Finish (1 Pair)</a>) and those have been great too - not sure why a few others did not like them except maybe they didn't use them on a Yost vice.		It's pretty heavy - over 60 lbs - and the lag bolts to hold it down are huge at 5/8".  At 5", the jaw opening is prefect for almost any task and the rotating head with multiple jaws is great.  Honestly, it's manly enough that I considered getting a pair of those truck balls for it.  I'm sure it will outlive me!		I didn't have any issues with shipping or anything like that.  It was shipped double-boxed in heavy boxes with a piece of Luan plywood at the bottom and it arrived via UPS without incident.
0,Nice to not have to hold the chuck in the valve
0,I purchased (and returned) this bulb since I was looking for an "evening light" that didn't emit blue light.  This bulb doesn't seem to emit blue light, which is great.  Unfortunately, it's a bit reddish as compared to Feit's orange CFL bulb (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Feit-Electric-BPESL13T-O-13-Watt-Compact-Fluorescent-Mini-Twist-Orange-Bulb/dp/B000LWIQ1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Feit Electric BPESL13T/O 13-Watt Compact Fluorescent Mini Twist Orange Bulb</a>).  We've been using the CFL since the colour is much nicer. I hope they can make this bulb less RED, since I'd prefer to use LED over CFL.		If you're looking for a LED light you can read by, and only emits a bit of blue light, try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Feit-Electric-A19-Y-LED-A19-Yellow-LED/dp/B00GOZYC9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Feit Electric A19/Y/LED A19 Yellow LED</a>.
0,the timer seems to stay pretty accurate... being mechanical and all. I have a 1500 Watt heater hooked up to it so I know it can take the amperage. WOrks like I'd hoped!
0,Good value and good service
0,This will give you an over view of the different types of tools and the different bits that are on the market.
0,Love this flashlight! The three levels make it perfect for daily carry, to use in the car or on the plane. Size is great. Rolls a bit but for the cost it's a great light!
0,Good cord, heavy duty and flexible. would recommend to anyone looking to buy a cord for commercial use or any use
0,Great for a camping mood light! Compact, easy to store. Plenty bright for 10w.
0,I'm happy
0,Stiff wire and good enough handle length.  Like the value price.
0,Works perfectly. I couldn't find one locally so Amazon saved the day - again. Nice product.
0,The piece comes about 16th an inch too long for my saw,
0,I am using two valve on a manifold so both me and my wife will be happy.  She likes a pressure massage and I like a rain like shower.  These are high quality easy to seal with wide openings that do not restrict water flow.  The larger type valve handle is perfect for easy operation even if your hands are wet and soapy.  Comes with a washer so it is  tighten with out a leak.  The valve operates smoothy.  So now I can switch between shower heads or leave them both on.
0,I have a kind of weak water pressure on my shower, but this shower head has double the water pressure!!
0,They worked,although some of the light sensors were not sensitive enough to shut off the nightlight with average in-home daylight or normal lighting.
0,Very happy with this purchase.  The batteries last all night and give off the prefect light for the flag
0,Very nice quality hose. I'd say it's plenty flexible and met all my expectations.
0,Good price. Nice little gift.
0,works great
0,The light set works well. I've had them for two weeks now and so far I am completely satisfied-- so satisfied I am considering ordering a few more strings as gifts.		The lights are tiny but brilliant.	The remote works well. The battery box seems to seal well. It even has a loop from which you can hang the box!  All the functions work as described, even the #4 (for which you are specifically instructed to WAIT for a few minutes to begin to work properly--exactly right!)	The wire is thin and seems quite delicate. As with all thin wire, bending it profoundly weakens it.  Do NOT fold it! Even gently bending is will shorten its functional life.  But it's a fair price for something you already KNOW won't last forever!	I arranged these very easily first by placing with tape, then when they were arranged well to my liking, I used zip ties to secure them and removed the tape.  Easiest balcony rail setup I've EVER had!
0,Very nice and very sturdy.  I had this installed in 10 minutes.  Can't beat that.
0,You may need to trim yours like I did with mine, however they do the job, they are cheap, not much more can be said.
0,Very nice micro torch for fine metal working - for people that can't afford the more expensive setups.
0,This Tank-less hot water heater worked good for a week then stopped working. Contacted Tech. support and the unit was Reset with the Reset button on the water flow sensing device.  Temperature range on the "Low" setting was 90 F to 128 F.
0,light, holds up great
0,Great hand saw that I got my dad for Christmas. The blade is nice an rigid versus some other brands where that have too much flex and bend. The teeth are very sharp and made quick work of limbs.
0,Light weight and Powerful.	So much better than the old NiCd batteries!		These are the 4.0Ah batteries, and not to mention there strengths (associated with Li-ion batteries), they do last for a very, very long time, while under a constant heavy work load.	When I compare the same work I did with a older DeWalt hammer drill and the 18v XRP NiCd battery, with the new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DeWalt-DCD995-20V-hammer-drill/dp/B00FWLC9DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DeWalt DCD995 20V hammer drill</a>, and just 1 of these DCB204 - 4.0Ah "Premium" battery, it's a complete NO contest!	The new Li-ion battery from DeWalt last so much longer, I'm talking a full work day, & more! I just love these Li-ion battery packs!		As said in another review, you can get these packs in varying Ah capacities.	1.5Ah, 2.0Ah, 3.0Ah, 4.0Ah		Before, I would need to change batteries usually twice a day, with the old 18v NiCd batteries and drill.	Now I can work for more than a full day with a single battery. So to me, thats one hell of a battery!		These light weight but powerful batteries also help with daily fatigue! I'm just so use to my old 18v hammer drill and battery weighing so much, and now this new combination of the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DCD995-hammer-drill/dp/B00FWLC9DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DCD995 hammer drill</a>, and the DCB204 - 4.0Ah battery weigh so little, it's really hard to believe you can do so much work with just one of these batteries.	But you can!!!	& they are amazing!		I've been waiting a long time for DeWalt to come out with Li-ion powered tools.	I've been doing rough and finish carpentry for over 35 years, along with custom cabinetry.	This new line of 20V MAX tools they have are all very nice, and both heavy duty, and affordable	Now that they've incorporated Li-ion batteries for power, they will be able to expand there tool line even more.	Even though other companies started using them sooner, I'm glad DeWalt took there time!	It shows in the tools quality build, and there tools performance!		For those of you that are unfamiliar with the advantages of Li-ion chemistry over NiCd & NiMH, please use your favorite search engine, and read for yourselves. There is plenty of good information online for you!		I do see 1 or 2 people complaining about Li-ion batteries not performing as good as the older NiCd batteries, and truthfully, those people have NO facts to back up there statements.		Li-ion batteries are a Very slow self drain, to NO self drain battery, meaning they keep there charge for a very long time! They have superior storage capacity, and integrated circuitry, to control & regulate, high output voltage and current, over heating, and over charging. There is no more memory effect, like there is in NiCd batteries. They are very safe to use (today), with there built in IC's		If these are on par with some of the best Li-ion batteries made today, they should be able to be recharged up to 500 times, and possibly more. I'm not sure what DeWalt says on this.		Though all batteries suffer, when used in cold weather, (lower output & performance), Li-ion batteries still out perform other batteries, in both work load & work time.	In other words, you couldn't ask for a better battery to use out in the cold!	You can find many fact based web sites on this as well.		One last thing, both these new line of 20V MAX tools, and these new line of 20 volt batteries get good reviews and ratings from 99% of buyers, so when you do read one of those unfounded reviews saying these are not good tools, please just do your own homework and fact find for yourself, in the end, you'll be glad you did!		Professional Quality Tools & Batteries, I Highly Recommended!!!
0,Great little organizer !!!
0,works great outdoors for xmas lights
0,I love it and plan to order several more in the next few weeks.
0,These are perfect for adapting from turret to screw in bases.	I would certainly recommend these for any adaption even in an outside environment.
0,I have purchased a lot of sollar lights over the last 5 years so far these are the best i have purchased ,  i have been a repeat purchaser of this exact light
0,This fan moves a lot of air across a large room on the "high" setting; albeit a bit noisy.  I have used it to circulate cooler air into our bedroom during the summer.  It is now circulating air in our office.  I added a washable "pre-filter" to this machine to reduce air-borne dust particles that would otherwise be "attracted" to my computers.
0,So far no problems as others have reported, ie. short life of led.
0,Great thanks
0,Great advancement in the trade. Fieldpiece has really set the bar with the new wireless gear.
0,This item does what it says it does. It holds 3 rolls of toilet paper, is not to tall and looks really good. The glass shelf where the paper sits is a nice touch. The rolls are easy to take out as well. I would recommend this to anyone looking to store rolls for use if you keep your toilet paper farther away.
0,It works and has a much more vibrant even color than a transparent color bulb.
0,perfect for what I needed
0,super and great price
0,Love it, looks amazing!
0,it's just wire.  Not much to report.
0,Thick and rugged, the plastic cages are a little weak but work
0,Made a really good Christmas gift for my grandchildren.  They had, and are still having, a good time playing with this gadget. In a slightly dim room, it makes a really good display
0,nice and compact.
0,this light is great. and way cheaper than similiar items
0,have spent over 2 hours filling out how I rate products that I bought through the last year or so and then you have to have 20 more words in order for me to submit my ratting. This is it.
0,Good product. Item description was correct.
0,good filter but only last about two weeks .
0,Good quality, great improvement for my 20 year old Makita!
0,This is a great set! Comes with a sheath, fire starter rod, and a decent knife! I sharpened the knife and its in my bug out bag, the fire started is strong. I've used it alot and hasn't broken or separated from the plastic end. Anyone who gives this a 1 star or complains at all isn't the smartest person around lol. ITS 7$ LOL. If u don't want the knife go buy the bear grylls fire starter. That works also but for the money. That extra knife and rod u can't go wrong here. The knife actually holds and edge and easily Sharpened. Its also thick. The cordage is just an added amenity.
0,The gloves arrived on time and in great condition.  Very nice craftsmanship, with very soft and supple leather, will not have to waste time breaking the gloves in.
0,GREAT IMPACT
0,Nice and heavy duty and fit was perfectly snug.  Not fancy.  If you need fancy, don't order this.
0,Who doesn't like to save a little cash? Converting from incandescent light bulbs to LED bulbs was one of the easiest ways to shave money off my monthly electric bill. The 100 watt equivalent is an accurate statement of the brightness of these LED bulbs. My Husbands insists on a well lit home, and he just raved about these bulbs once he put them in our laundry room. It was one of the last rooms we converted to LED. The screw into the socket just like the old incandescent bulbs did, how easy is that? They only use 12.w of electricity! That's even better than some of the other brands of LED bulbs on the market. They last for 25000 hours, so we put them in the foyer of our home. The light fixtures in the foyer require a 16 ft ladder to replace the bulbs, so that's one task we don't have to tackle as often. The savings on the bulbs themselves is impressive too. I paid as much as $15 to $20 per bulb depending on the wattage in the store. These bulbs are much less per bulb. This was an opportunity I didn't want to pass up. I am 100 % happy with my purchase and love the good quality of the bulbs.		** I'm a non payed reviewer and get offers for free or discounted products to review.

0,I love this LED book light! It's rechargeable which is such a great option for me. I go through way too many book lights because the battery can be just as expensive as buying a new light.		The switch to turn the light on is on the top of the lights	 There's two different brightness settings. Both are easy on the eyes to read with. The light clips on to your book and the heads are bendable.	It's not too bright so you shouldn't be disturbing your significant other if they're asleep.	This product comes with the charger also so that's a big plus! This is definitely a book light any book lover should own.
0,Charge lasts a lot longer than expected.
0,Works well, easy to install. Don't forget to buy a chord.
0,This Reverse Osmosis is AMAZING, the pressure and taste put your parent's RO to shame! I think it tastes better than bottled water and you can fill a glass in 1-2 seconds. No more waiting for SLOW RO, this system uses increased 3/8" plumbing for all the crucial stuff! The installation is simple and straight forward, I installed myself with no plumbing experience (I am not condoning installing with no experience, installation is not fool-proof). It could be better/easier to install if the faucet mounting nut didn't use the same thread as the water line, so you could tape and install the water adapter/pipe before having to mount it, wink ;)		I also want to put out this warning, but take it at face value because the manufacturer has not yet verified my assessment. Also the manufacturer has told me they have never heard of this happening before, so my experiences are not typical. The manufacturer is a great small company based in Arizona, USA, where they also make the systems.		You system should never start pumping randomly and needs at least one of the following installed in your house:	1) A functioning / properly sized expansion tank on your hot water heater	2) A one way check valve on the cold water supply to your hot water heater (for older houses with no expansion tank)	3) An undersized pressure regulator installed before the RO system to prevent water pressure spikes from being pumped into RO		In my case, my hot water heater expansion tank bladder burst months after RO install (and had nothing to do with the RO system). This caused hot water to be pumped into the cold water pipe and into my RO system!  If you have no idea what I'm talking about: just buy the system and install it, my experiences are not typical. If you don't have any random fillings, your fine. If you do, consult an expert.		For those that want a little more on the science: when water is heated in your hot water heater, it expands in a process called thermal expansion. This increase in pressure should be absorbed by an expansion tank to protect the valves and pipes in your home. Increasing water pressure causes the bladder in the expansion tank to shrink (because air IS compressible), allowing more water to enter and thus relieving pressure. Not having any of the above mentioned devices can result in your RO system being used as an expansion tank, since it is the only place for expanding water to go! Causing hot mixed with cold (warm) water to be possibly pumped all the way to your RO.
0,It's a hunk of metal that does what it is suppose to do.
0,I have bought 8 of these over time and I love these for storing small parts and screw hardware (4-40 in one box, 6-32 in another box, pop rivets in another box, etc.). The rearrangeable containers do a great job of keeping things separate, and the plastic seems thick and good quality. Really small components like 4-40 split lock washers can actually migrate into other compartments, but only little by little if you move the toolbox around a lot. It is still good enough to use for such small parts in my opinion.
0,This toolbox system is great! I have 3 small boxes, 3 large boxes, the hand truck and a drawer unit. I've been using them for about 9 months every day and I am not easy on tools.		They are great but not magic. There is a maximum weight per box DeWalt indicates. My hunch is most of the negative experiences stemmed from exceeding that limit. They are tough but they are not invincible. You sacrifice totally destruction proof boxes in order to save weight by not making them out of steel.		The yellow clips for stacking boxes work but I don't 100% trust them. If you have two light weight boxes you could carry stacked. I mostly use them to keep stacked boxes in line while they are in my shop or truck.		The side handles are better but I think would give out if you tried carrying way too much in one box.		Front and top handles are super tough and comfortable.		The waterproof feature is wonderful! Definitely legit (does not apply to drawer unit).		The trolly is great! Very sturdy, nice handle. The wheels are widely set which can be tricky in tight spaces. Helps with stability though. They are also solid so you don't have to worry about getting a flat tire.		I would highly recommend this system.
0,I have a hammer toe so shoes have to fit right..I can wear these every day all day long without any problems.  and they are sooo cute.
0,works wonderfully
0,Quality product.
0,Its as good as the other reviews say it is.  It does get tripped up on metal/flashing, but what sensor doesn't.
0,Exactly as described, Very happy.
0,This light is great and installation was a snap.  After reading all the reviews about the LED light vs. the Laser I purchased the LED light.  I can't add anything else which has not been said already.  It's a great product and works as advertised.
0,Looks like niches in wall!  I love it!!  Don't know why I didn't think of this first !
0,work good
0,i'm not sure about the claims of replacing bulbs every two decades (phillips), but for now these work just as well as the more expensive Phillips ones.  They are small, and fit in my recessed housing nicely.
0,great !
0,Used on a couple of guns and found well fitting screw heads in all cases. Will be using on some scope setups and verified all necessary heads are included. Will be great to use on the range.
0,adorable
0,My fan was really loud, I believe the bearings we're going bad.  This was a perfect fit for the old fan and worked like a charm.  Much quieter now.
0,This is an excellent product. Works with motion and is very bright.  Well made and small in size yet great functions.	I have ordered 3 x more. Motion sensing as well as day night sensor.	Magnetic strip for easy mounting.
0,I bought a house recently and can't tell you how many times I've used this from sanding walls to wood trim, it's an excellent sander.  I hooked it up to shop vac and love that option to control dust.
0,Work exactly as advertised.  Best strip holder I have found for sockets.  A little expensive was why I only gave 4 stars.
0,If your looking for a bright and durable light, buy it.
0,works
0,Performed as expected
0,It looks better than the one that come on the unit ! Time will tell !
0,good
0,GREAT PRODUCT
0,It's an air filter, but most important is that it does its job very well. For the price, I felt it was a great buy, along with quality.
0,Works good but if it's like the last one will last about 5 years till it leaks.  Way overpriced for what it is
0,came quickly, easy to install, there is a plate that goes behind the unit that the screws go into.  This plate tightens against the drywall so there is no need for any studs or supports behind this unit.  Easy as marking out spot, making sure no stud was there, cutting the hold and screwing it together!		Looks great, nice brushed nickel finish and does not feel cheap when taking rolls on and off the spring bar.
0,Great quality cable and sturdy plugs.  Just what I needed.  I expect it will last a long time.
0,Very happy with purchase. Excellent quality!
0,I love Makita drill and drill drivers, the are  tough as drills come..........I also use their small drill/driver and it is a work horse.........
0,fit my router table and router perfectly, now i don't have to use my router base that came with my router anymore, no more taking the stock on and off from under my table. this replacement will stay under the table permanently.
0,This is an excellent lamp with a nice, heavy base. Assembly is easy. Uses a three-way bulb, but is not finger-touch controlled. Interesting design is also perforated in some design areas, allowing little illuminated spots to show through. Terrific as an accent piece. Check out Amazon's "Warehouse Deals", which is where I found mine at a substantial discount.
0,Love these, and what an awesome deal!!  We bought 4 of these for our summer cabin and they look great!!
0,I received one as a gift years ago, I love it.		Works really well and I give it as a practical gift often.		Includes a razor knife blade built in.
0,Great price for these bulbs, and great service!!
0,Perfect!  Make sure you read the dimensions and know what you are ordering.  They are smaller than they appear in the photos which seems to have been an issue with other reviewers.
0,I love all of these spring assist knives. Own about 14 of them
0,PERFECT!		INSTALLED QUICKLY (be SURE to turn your Main Breakers OFF before you begin!).		DEPENDABLE performance for almost a year now, in fact I ordered a second Thermostat ~ not because I doubted this one, but to have a spare ~ just in case.
0,They are pretty bright for just three LED lights on each one. I set them up in my backyard to light it for my dog at night. Correct placement was key to light everything well, I didn't just shine them down onto the ground from the gutter. I placed them where I would get the most use out of them. When there is a lot of sun they last much longer into the night. Duh - it's solar
0," TOTAL BEAST MODE " 	I can't imagine there will be ANY bolts	I come across that this thing won't remove.
0,Lasts a long time and light is perfect.
0,This is a great idea for those of us who - for reasons of age or ability - find it difficult to disconnect a Sharkbite connection. It works just as you expect.
0,We really like the flexibility of this unit.  It can be higher than most.  Very nice spray.  But...be aware of the space needed, since it only bends so far.  If you have a cramped shower, this will not be comfortable for you!
0,Perfect!
0,Simple and easy to use.  I appreciated the sticker on the bottom that you can use to mount this to your soldering iron holder.  Both holds things in place well and also easy to remove when it is time to replace.  Nice extra.
0,Very attractive and easy to install. Cutting the tiles was easy with a chop saw with a fine tooth (80 teeth) metal cutting blade.
0,They are working great.
0,Its hard to go wrong with a rock<G>... I have a whole garden full of these shades of rock, so it is very well camouflaged.
0,I have broken many brands of these. Many Have bought on Amazon. I use them to tighten a 9" twist cap/Lid on IBC totes.  I put these to a huge stress tes and this Boa Constrictor is the best to date.  The black rubber on handle will not last long but it isn't necessary for use. The long length of strap would alow a much larger diameter to be used on as well.
0,Exact fit for RIDGID 6 inch jointer/planer. Would order these blades again.
0,Milton makes them as Hi quality as they come.
0,very good filters they work great we have 4 cats and it catches all the hair from them.
0,These sponges work well.  Easy to use when spackling just wipe off excess and then no sanding. A tile setter told me this trick and it works on dry wall too.
0,I've ordered all the pieces in this set, and the design on this one is fabulous.  I love the whole set, and it's all very good quality.  Solid, not flimsy at all.  And just stunning.
0,This tape works!  Don't expect it to be super sticky right off of the roll.  It takes time for the bond to set.  I used it for the bottom of a motorcycle windshield where the screw mounts had broken.  The only other option was a lot of work disassembling the body work and replacing parts.  I used the VHB tape and the bond is great!
0,Nice.  Light and clear.  If you want eyeglasses-style arms, there's a set included, you can pop off the strap and install the arms.  I used these for the first time yesterday, on a cold/windy day on my fishing boat.  Perfect.
0,Well built, sturdy and easy to clean.  Holds vast quantities of strained foods or veggies.  Easily adjusts to fit wherever you want it to.
0,great deal
0,Just used one it worked great the teeth did not lose size
0,This PAR30 floodlight bulb seems to put out the equivalent light of the 65W incandescent bulbs I have (about 500 lumens).  The color of the light is pretty close to incandescent as well, which is nice; I don't like the bluish light that some LEDs produce.  Another benefit of this bulb is that (I hope) it will function out in the garage where I have it in the winter.  As you probably know, incandescent bulbs do not like it cold, and the spiral bulbs I have out there now take several minutes to warm up with it's cold out.		There are just a couple things that I would consider before buying this bulb:		1) It is not "instant-on" when you turn on the switch; there is maybe a 1 second delay.  Not a deal-breaker, but just something to note as opposed to their package advertising.	2) The bulb is heavy.  If you are replacing it using one of those poles because it's out of reach, note that this one would do more damage if it fell.	3) It's expensive at $32+.  The advertising says you would save $107 over the life of the bulb compared to a 50W halogen flood light at 11 cents/KWH.  Which brings me to #4:	4) The Limited Warranty is only 3 years (although they claim it will last 36.5 years at 3 hours/day).  Why limit the warranty to 3 years if it's supposed to last 36?		So, this bulb would be a good replacement for your PAR30 incandescent flood lights, but at a cost of less than $20/each, in my opinion.  The 3-year warranty worries me and this being new technology, I would wait for the prices to come down on these LED replacement bulbs before going all-in on replacing your existing bulbs.  Remember how expensive CF bulbs were when they came out?  Same deal here -- wait until it makes more economic sense to buy this.
0,I bought 2 of these, buying 2 more.  They do not have any cork backing on the rear side, which is PERFECT because it means they sit flat on whatever you are measuring, meaning you can draw much more accurate lines and get more accurate measurements.  They are accurately marked, nice and heavy gauge steel, and just exactly what you want in a ruler.
0,It does what it is supposed to.
0,Nice little box. Decent quality for electronic projects.
0,I wanted a screen with a wood frame to put in front of my regular screen for extra protection for the kids, and for the cat, who likes to sit on the windowsill. Over time, the regular screen was getting pushed out. I replaced the main screen, but bought this to keep it from getting damaged again. I love it! It fits nicely in the groves behind the window and in front of the regular screen.  I can shut my window without taking it out.  It glides open nicely, and I love that it's made in the USA.		Con: The only think I wish it had was a locking device, so it will stay where you put it. I stretched it open, and I think it would stay in place. Most people probably would probably be fine with it as is, but for me, with the kids, I'd prefer if it could lock in place. I taped it in place so it can't move.
0,Needed an extra garage door opener for my motorcycle.  This fits perfectly in my pocket.  Just wish it had a keychain attachment.  Programming was simple...just follow instructions.  Worked with my Genie II GDO.
0,About what you'd expect for the money.
0,Where I live these are required by law on every level of the home.  After looking at the various models, I choose this as best serving my needs for the architecture of my home. Quick delivery. Highly recommended. Past experience with First Alert and Dual Sensor has been positive.
0,works great and saved much money from having others do for me.
0,we use it to clip to our dog leash. Help to be seen at night. They are small and give good light.
0,Perfect OEM part.
0,I just put this lock on a door I wanted to control from curious toddlers. It seems to work pretty well and I had plenty of room in the door to put it in. If you have a really tight fit, then this product will probably not work.		I did notice one small problem. After you put it in a "locked" position, you can't just push it up all the way to unlock it. You have to push it up to the correct position so that the door will open. If you push it up all the way, the lock will not open up. You have to just push it up a bit for it to unlock.		I also notice that they include a "anti-lockout" screw. You put this in to prevent the lock from working. Why would anyone do this? The purpose of the lock is to allow the door to be locked. It seems like the extra screw is defeating the purpose of the lock.		In summary - for small kids this should work fine until they learn about climbing onto chairs.
0,Nice looking, works great for the purpose. you will need a electrician to install unless you have electrical experience.	You will be pleased
0,I use this to make homemade Nerf dart heads.  They're called 'stefans', after their creator.  Go to [...] for more details.		Oh, and the putty?  It's pliable, tacky, and I suppose it will be great for insulation.  I can't get the individual cords apart, but that's fine for my purposes.
0,Awesome. I am very happy with this product. Instruction shut be better
0,Great purchase. Accurate description and quick delivery.
0,gets you what you need
0,academy award winner
0,Works Great
0,This really puts out a lot of heat with regular propane. You can also use Map-Pro with this but I have not used that yet. You can heat fasteners up to about 1/2 inch diameter to a dull red hot for removal with this. Makes sweating copper easy. Unfortunately, real MAPP gas is no longer produced or you might be able to braze with this.
0,Heavy duty Breaker bar.  Just what I needed!
0,Exactly what I was looking for!
0,This made an easy fix when a contractor some how broke my external faucet. I was worried I wouldn't be able to install a new faucet without a plumber.
0,This is a really high quality knife.  The assisted opening function works fantastic and is legal to carry because it is not switch activated.  Amazingly sharp.  Light weight but feels good in the hand.
0,I was very skeptical about ordering this cord because it is so cheap.  But after getting it I am very surprised at the quality.  And its OSHA approved.  And the shipping was free is you have Amazon Prime.  You can't get a 12/3 cord at Home Depot for this price, I think they are close 40 bucks.  As a contractor I will probably order 10 more of them just to have on hand at this price.  Don't be bothered by the lack of a photo, I almost didn't order it because of that.  You will be happy you bought this one over the others that are much more money
0,Thanks to the LED bulbs the arm which the bulbs are in is narrow and thin, this is a big difference from the former (older) lamps. I like the adjustable arm so you can move it to where you need light. However it does not throw light strongly over a large area of the desk and to get the light I need it must be on the highest setting; there are three brightness levels. I cannot see a reason to use the other two dimmer lamp settings since this is a desk lamp or task light.		My original intent for this was for a better desk lamp for my husband as the ceiling fan's overhead light is too dim to read and do paperwork with however I like it best for a task light for knitting. I have been using it in the family room to light my hands holding the needles and yarn so I can see it well without the use of a strong whole room overhead lighting. The way the bar moves means I can angle the light to throw it just where I need it and there is no light getting in other family member's way of viewing the television. The room light can be off and I can use this desk lamp for my project.		The base is heavy and the arm moves easily. The power cord is a separate piece. It seems pricey. I am rating this 4 stars due to the brightness having three levels and because I think the two lower levels are not suitable for any deskwork, reading, or crafting work.
0,Good deal on this Thank You
0,snaps perfectly over the rubbermaid bracket. Looks great. nice and large.
0,Kohler makes quality products.  This was an easy install and looks great.
0,Great headlight. I pretty much stick to the Energizer line, they seem to only get better and come out with more options. I would recommend this for sure.
0,A perfect finish to any bath
0,ok
0,great set of small sockets for many uses
0,When I went looking for a replacement for my old disposal I naturally went to consumer reports to see what they had to say.  They rated the Waste King disposals very highly.  I found other online sites that also rated the Waste King disposals highly as well, especially this particular model.  And, now that I've installed it myself, I have to say that I agree with everyone else who rated this disposal very highly.  I especially like the new attachment fixture. In my opinion, it is WAY better than the old three bolt system.  Just be sure to get your top sink fitting in place and putted in correctly or the disposal is NEVER going to seal correctly.  So, in short, I'm really enjoying my new disposal.  It's quiet and it does what I need it to do.  What more can anyone say?  :)
0,Great size and quality, so good I am ordering a second group for another house.
0,Bought two.  Different colors.  Get stopped to find out where I got them.  Seem to be great quality
0,After I managed to crush the crystal on my wife's favorite Anne Cline watch, and having previously fought a few other watch cases, I decided to find a more practical solution.  Look no further, this is it!  This little guy is well made, and I simply couldn't believe how easy it became to put the back on an otherwise stubborn watch!  I'm really glad I have it!
0,This is a great product to deliver soap in the kitchen. We have a full 1 gallon bottle of soap setting on the cabinet floor and the dispenser has no problem lifting the liquid soap for delivery at the sink height.
0,Just as pretty as the picture.
0,I installed 3 out of 5 so far.  The hardest part was removing the 25 year old faucets and installing new shutoff valves. The American Standard faucets then installed very easily and work just as expected.  The included instructions were quite sufficient.  I seleced this model because it has "lifetime" ceramic cartridges. I will post another review in 20 years or so, sooner if they show signs of failure.  At some point we will be installing new sinks and will get to see just how easy these faucets are to remove and re-install.  For now we are very happy.
0,No horrible smell.  Just what the cats needed!
0,This latch works great. Very strong.
0,Good quality and a fair price!
0,It doesn't work with my swamp cooler system, but does work with radiant in-floor heating, which is nice. I can't wait for a product update that also works with my evaporative cooler.
0,nice
0,This is an excellent set of tools with typical Channellock quality.  I purchased them for emergency use in my pickup truck and the toolroll is a perfect way to store them.
0,Nicely made stand and a good deal for the price!
0,Works great and far better cost vs. other manufacturers like snap on
0,This lighting feature is beautiful. The cut glass reflects the light and the quality of material is great. It is definitely a good buy and I will be purchasing some more of these as I retrofit my house.
0,I was looking for a base material that would stick to TPU while hot but release when cold.  The blue painter's tape works like a charm.  No need to apply an adhesive coating.  ABS works well also.  Although the super wide tape is expensive, it is well worth the price in convenience.  Yes, one could use multiple strips of thinner tape but with the super wide roll, no marks are left on your print from overlapping tape strips.  The super wide tape is very easy to apply to a glass plate. The plate on my FlashForge Creator Pro is approximately 6x9 inches so the super wide tape covers it completely.  Highly recommended!
0,Works great! I have found many uses for these! Buy them, they are a great deal!!! I LOVE THE EZ LOCK SYSTEM!
0,Bright and good quality. I use it for my gun workbench and it is perfect for my 55 year old eyes.
0,Item as described. I would buy again.
0,Great quality! Love it!
0,After trying virtually every brand of LED light bulb this was the best....		The technological advances in the development of LED light bulbs have been fast and furious, with manufacturers competing to design LED bulbs suitable for every application in the home, while working to lower the retail price to a tipping point of mass consumer acceptance.		Today, these goals have largely been met. LED light bulbs are more cost-effective than their incandescent or CFL counterparts, and specialty LEDs have become widely available for the different lighting applications in modern homes.		Here are a few tips to help you make sense of the many energy-efficient lighting solutions on the market today, and how to choose the best LED bulb for your lighting needs.		1. The new Lumens rating makes buying LED bulbs much simpler	conversion for lumensChoosing a light bulb today is more complicated than ever, and the choice of bulbs keeps growing. Consumers have to choose between incandescents, CFLs, halogens and LEDs, and a multitude of sizes and shapes, different bases, and of course widely differing prices.		The FTC has recently mandated that, by 2012, all light bulb packages will be standardized with new labels which will make it much easier to buy light bulbs, whether they be incandescent, LED, CFL or halogen. The main indicator on the light bulb package will be "lumens", which will replace the current "watts". Lumens represents the amount of light emitted by a light source, and is a more accurate measure of the brightness of a bulb.		So no matter what kind of bulb you are interested in, simply comparing lumens will enable you to compare the brightness level each bulb will deliver. After you determine the lumen level you prefer, you can then look to other indicators such as energy efficiency, lifetime run cost, and dimmability to select the ideal bulb for your application.		To learn more about the upcoming new labeling system for all light bulbs, see our article: Lumens are the New Watts.		2. LED bulbs contain no mercury	One of the hurdles to broad consumer acceptance of energy-efficient CFL bulbs is the presence of a small amount of mercury in the bulbs. Consumers are concerned that they may be adding mercury to the environment when the bulb is disposed. If a CFL bulb is broken, consumers are advised to treat the broken bulb as a hazardous material.		The mercury issue with CFLs is confusing because manufacturers reason that actually less mercury enters the environment when CFLs are used to replace incandescent bulbs. A power plant will emit 10mg of mercury to produce the electricity to run an incandescent bulb compared to only 2.4mg of mercury to run a CFL for the same time. The net benefit of using the more energy efficient lamp is positive, and this is especially true if the mercury in the fluorescent lamp is kept out of the waste stream when the lamp expires. However, this reasoning only applies if your electricity comes from coal-fired sources.		The presence of mercury in CFL bulbs is a real issue with consumers. At Eartheasy's online store, we have discontinued selling CFLs because of customer concern over the presence of mercury in CFL bulbs.		LED bulbs contain no mercury, so there is no special concern with handling or disposal of LED bulbs.		3. LEDs give instant light, and many LED bulbs are dimmable	dimmable LED bulbWhen turning on CFLs and tubular fluorescent light bulbs, there is a slight hesitation before brightness is achieved, and some bulbs may flicker during warm up or even during operation. Unlike fluorescents, LED bulbs, like incandescent bulbs, reach full illumination as soon as they are turned on. This is a real advantage over CFL bulbs in areas of the home where lights are frequently turned on and off. Also, LED lights produce a steady light which does not flicker.		Earlier versions of LED bulbs had the disadvantage of not being dimmable. Today, many LED bulbs are designed to work in dimmable switches which are provided in many lamps and home lighting fixtures. Just be sure to check the package to ensure the bulb you have selected is dimmable.		LED lights last a long time and unlike other light bulbs, they do not burn out, but rather dim over time.		4. LEDs won't contribute to heat buildup in your home	This summer has been the hottest on record, and homeowners are increasingly interested in measures which can help reduce the amount of heat generated within the home. Electric lighting is one of the main culprits. Incandescent lights produce ideal illumination in terms of brightness and quality of light, but they also produce a considerable amount of heat.		A 100 watt incandescent bulb produces 100 watts of power. From an energy point of view, it puts out 100 Joules of energy per second. In a small closed room, 4 m (12ft) x 4 m(12ft) x 3 m(9ft) or 48 m with a single 100w bulb:		48 m x 1.2 kg/m = 58 kg of air	100J = 1000 J/kgC x T x 58 kg	T = 0.0017 deg C, change in temp. per second		In one hour, the bulb would produce a 6 degree C rise. or 11 deg F. This assumes the room is closed to ventilation, so the temperature would be lower if the room were ventilated, or larger. But it serves to illustrate that the heat contribution from an incandescent bulb is significant.		LED bulbs, by contrast, remain cool. High power LEDs are designed with heat sinks, usually aluminum struts around the lower bulb, which keeps operating temperatures low. LED bulbs do not contribute to heat buildup in a room.		5. Insects are not attracted to UV-free LED bulbs	Many LED bulbs (but not all) do not give off ultraviolet light, which is known to attract flying insects. Check the package label for UV information if you are interested in this feature.		There are also specialty LED bulbs which have yellow lenses or bulbs, which are designed for outdoor use in carports, decks or on patios. These yellow bulbs will not attract the bugs and moths which seem to cluster around ordinary white bulbs. These bulbs produce adequate light for the intended area; they just don't attract bugs.		6. Choose LED bulbs which are UL Listed, not UL Compliant	A light bulb package marked "UL Compliant" is no assurance that the LED bulb has been tested or approved by the Underwriters Laboratory. It only means that the manufacturer has followed recommended UL guidelines in production and technical aspects. A "UL Listed" LED bulb has passed stringent tests put forth by UL, and consumers are advised to look for the UL Listed mark.		In the race to garner a share of the emerging LED market, manufacturers may use the UL Compliant mark to help sell more light bulbs, but this is no guarantee of bulb quality. Consumers should be wary of new LED bulbs which are priced very low, are sourced from unknown suppliers, or have unrealistic product claims.		7. Don't let the sticker price shock you	The initial cost of LED bulbs may be misleading to consumers unfamiliar with the new LED bulbs. While the initial cost of the LED bulb is higher than the cost of an incandescent or CFL bulb, the savings is recouped over time because the bulb will last longer and use less energy than other bulbs. You will see the savings in your electric bill.		For a cost comparison chart which shows how you will save money by buying LED bulbs, see our page LED vs CFL vs incandescent bulbs.		The trend in lighting is moving towards more widespread adoption of LEDs for residential as well as commercial use. Today, builders of new homes are installing LED bulbs in many fixtures, and as LED bulb prices continue to go down, this trend is going to grow. A little knowledge about these bulbs will help you get the best value for your dollar.
0,for drilling of larger diameter holes in wood these saws really shine, much easier to sue than the regular version
0,I used them once so far had a project that I and the punches worked fine. will be able to say more if and when I start working with more leather.
0,This works very well to corral those unsightly and annoying wires around my desk. I especially like the length of these because they cover the entire length of my exposed cables from my over the bed mounted computer to my desk. Very easy to use and once applied I only have to do it if I remove them. Much easier and neater than any other cable tie I have used. Definitely recommend these if you are picky like me.
0,look great in the remodeled kitchen
0,Fits perfect and good bright chrome finish. Ordered two more for other interior doors

0,Also beware using outdoors. The sun is an excellent source of UV.  :-)
0,Good deal good dealer. AA++
0,I am a very experienced user with x10, z-wave, vera and some zigbee. I had no trouble with my setup. I did cause an unusual issue - all caused by me. I needed to delete a module that was no longer attached by something I did. I caused it by an external device. I had a full understanding of what I caused - I needed customer service to fix it - answered the phone within 3 minutes - understood what I was talking about and fixed it. This was something I could not perform from the app as it module was no longer attached.		Very easy to use and incredibly powerful. With the latest Z-Wave		This is am amazing product that other firms charge huge amounts!		Thanks so much!
0,i needed a pin nailer for some very fine trim 1/4" quater rounds on a stair case. this worked perfectly. this is the second freeman nailer i have purchased. both have worked with no problem and are half the cost of the other nailers i looked at. a great deal
0,Easy to install and quiet running.  Note that it comes with a plug in cord though you can convert it to have a line come into the unit.  I like the removable rubber insert.  The disposal does not take up much space under the sink.
0,It's a Leatherman. There really isn't much more to say. They make high quality tools and this is indeed one. Makes a good gift.
0,Works great, easy to set up and very accurate.
0,Good product, comes in very handy unless you like carrying a huge screwdriver every place you go.
0,Used this for a Christmas Nativity Scene in the front yard.  Had no problems with it be it rain, sleet, snow, or wind.  Well made.
0,Great sunglasses! Nice and light and very comfortable.
0,Our plumber installed it with no problem.  We paired it with Delta T14051 Dryden Monitor 14 Series Valve Trim.  It works great!
0,So far this thing has been great - easy to use and really gets the job done!  The different-sized mouths are a neat feature.
0,This Solar Powered Lights PIR Motion Sensor Dual Head Spotlight by Vinus works great! This is a good quality light. It's made from durable plastic. The light runs off of solar power so make sure you put it where there will be sun for about 6 to 8 hours. I really like solar lights because you don't have to change batteries or use extension cords.		These lights swivel so you can point them in any direction that you want. You can have them pointed in two different areas that you need light. They are great for the driveway and door areas. The light will automatically come on when you step in range of the motion sensor. This is nice for an area that you don't want light all the time. We have a problem with the outside door light attracting bugs when it's on for more than a minute and this will remedy that. You get the solar wall light, the screws, and the user manual. This solar light works great and I would recommend it.		I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on my own experiences.
0,I love this deadbolt. I have a Schlage keypad lock set on another door that has been there for 4 years and it works perfectly. The only reason I didn't give the deadbolt 5 stars was it didn't come with a template for installing in a door without pre-drilled holes. If your door has a spot for a lock set and a deadbolt it will be easy to install and take about 5 min. Without a template I had to be very careful to drill the 2 1/8" hole and the 1" hole so they would line up perfectly. Mission accomplished and the lock looks and works great.
0,I've owned several of these and they've always worked great. They're a little tricky to install, but once they're up and running it's the best security and energy savings you can have for your home. We have them set to turn on lights from dawn to dusk every night and don't have to worry about leaving town.
0,Nice weight to them.
0,Very nice at cutting small wires.  A quality blade.
0,I have used this tool in a variety of applications and was very pleased. The concept, construction, blade changing, instructions, and general quality are high. But like other reviewers, I feel that it is overpriced, at least for non-professional users, who would be happy with a lesser quality tool. Perhaps the greatest problem is the high price of blades and other accessories.	If it and the blades last 10 years, though, I will feel very satisfied.
0,Great concept to store my tri bike and rather easy to install. We found it much easier to use an electric screwdriver to make sure they were tightly secured in place. We also pre-drilled where we wanted the hoist to be attached.  Hoist was installed in our garage where the ceiling is a dry wall substance. Was a bit nervous to see if it would withhold the weight of  of my bike (31 lbs) and surprisingly it does.
0,It's brazing flux, it does the job and if you are like me and don't use it often, this might be a lifetime supply since a little goes a long way.
0,just an awesome saw. I built a 1000 Square feet with it.
0,Don't know if this is a 5Star product, but so far it appears to be worth a 4Star rating. These DC systems are incredibly quiet during operation. They definitely will surprise anyone who grew up under Dad's AC motor version with a chain drive. Like night and day.	Will need to wait and see if power fluctuation give it trouble and 'forgetful' after a spike on the household system. Replaced a Genie, Revolution 1000  with this Chamberlain model (about 3 years old and paid equal price-not happy about shelling out another $200 so soon). Preferred Genie's enclosed belt versus this Chamberlain design rail and belt that droops outside when changes in tension occur along the travel distance. Really, really like the automatic closing feature and it is selectable for different duration intervals. Super easy to install when replacing an existing GDO (Garage Door Opener). This can be a one person job if you have a step ladder, a little bit of time, a little bit of patience and either a 2 or 3 step stool.	Only downside so far appeared on two install/setup issues: First were the mounting brackets for the photo sensor safety system. They were nearly useless but I was able to modify them enough to get an adequately stable mounting platform. Chamberlain should work on the design and maybe even splurge and provide more than a single bracket with this kit. Sensors have a lot of room for adjusting tilt and pan. This is invaluable.  Second is strictly in the programming for the travel distance, force and sensitivity adjustments. This is a complex set of variables that can be difficult to program. Chamberlain (and others in this type of DC powered machine) have combined the three settings into a single, two step, function. It may take a little bit of finesse to find the sweet spot on the downward, or closing travel. Done properly the GDO then performs as needed to avoid a serious injury. But since it is a fairly simple set of instructions, taking a few times to get to the location isn't a difficult chore. Double, maybe triple checking the system for its ability to reverse upon hitting an obstruction is your most important part to this entire install. Don't skimp here. Do it and do it right. It is an imperative that you know that your install will perform as designed. It is especially true if you have household pets and/or children around that may very well wind up in the path of the door when it closes. Nobody wants an injury from a machine with as much power as these GDO's can exert.
0,These are hard to get since they have not been manufactured by Zinscofor years.  I had a breaker fail and an electrician friend recommended salvage yards.  He knew of a couple sources that would sell a used breaker for more than I paid for this new one.		Fit was fine.  I did have to replace a single wide with a double wide, but I had plenty of room in the breaker panel
0,This works good and I haven't broken it yet
0,They both seem to possess the same power as the other XC 5's --have not used them extensively to really test but so far so good. The price as right and they arrived on time and in great shape.
0,This is such a simple and easy tool to use. The package came with a case as described along with included batteries. Its really the little things that make life easier. In terms of the accuracy, it seemed very accurate. This is when comparing it to another moisture meter that I have. The readings were usually no more than two percentage points off.		One thing to keep in mind, this moisture meter works by coming into contact with the object it is measuring. There are multiple types of sensors out there, but I'm not sure which one is the most accurate. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to friends.
0,Case kinda sux, but the product itself is great. Very complete set of security bits. Use most of them frequently and they haven't let me down yet.
0,I purchased it to match other bathroom fixtures (faucet, robe hook, paper holder, light, and towel bar).Moen makes nice stuff, but not sure it worth the cost.
0,These hinges are very sturdy however they are little testy to install if you have frames on the fronts of your cabinets.  They aren't as sturdy as if the cabinet was a solid box and the door covers the entire cabinet.  With the type of mount that is shown in the picture they don't quite mount to the frame quite as sturdy as I would prefer but overall I suggest them to a friend.
0,Great-bright light
0,I'm partial to Lansky sharpeners, as I've been using the same Lansky knife sharpening set since the 1980's, and its still going strong..	I picked this up to sharpen a hatchet and axe that I've recently began using around some wooded property I purchased.	The grits are medium, used for normal sharpening and coarse, used for reshaping and taking out deep nicks on the edge.	The puck has a 3" diameter and fits nicely into the hand.  It quickly takes down a dull edge leaving a nice sharp (for an axe) edge.  It will leave swirl marks along the edge, but then again, who cares...its an axe..	I've only used it a few times, but i'm guessing, like all lansky products.. it'll last a long time..	Nice to have a company that knows how to make a quality product at a good price.
0,This is my third Waste King Instant Hot. I get about 5-6 years out of a unit before it starts leaking. Nice thing about replacing one with the same thing is it takes all of 10 minutes (max) to do it. Unplug the old one and disconnect two hoses, pop it off the bracket on the back wall, and pop the new one on and plug in the hoses and electrical plug and you're done.
0,will be buying it late (1 more)
0,The product works well. It seems overpriced for what it does. I'm not complaining about the product or how it works but the price-point really bothers me.
0,Really nice handle pulls I used in my kitchen, walk in closet and living room. I used these pulls on all drawers and cabinet doors. These were simple stright forward pulls with no unneeded ornimentation. These are well made pulls with a good but not great fit and finish.  The consistancy of quality is also good.  These pulls come in many sizes and I purchased many different sizes of these pulls each had the same level of good quality.  the lengths were different but the quality was the exact same.  These pulls are best used when you are going for a clean contemporary feel to the space being designed.  These are brushed nickel which accent a stainless steel kitchen decor nicely. I teamed my pulls with nice shaker styled wood cabinet doors and drawers throughout my home. The major theme in my house has three main elements, steel\nickel, stone and glass. These pulls make a strong quality and design statement in any well throught out design plan.
0,This is a good flashlight. I think it is a bit overpriced at the $16 or so price point. I think it should be more like $12 or $13. That being said, this flashlight is exactly what I was looking for. I was tired of the small 3 AAA flashlights that I have that have 2, 3 or 4 way switches. You know, the ones that go bright...dim...blinking...and maybe even SOS blinking. These are a pain when all you want is on and off. This one is just on and off. No other (mostly) useless modes. The rear mounted switch has a white rubber cover that glows in the dark (very dimly-pretty much to the point of that being a useless "feature"). Not sure how long it will glow but not useful anyways so I guess it doesn't matter. I wasn't impressed with either the feel or sound of the switch in terms of the impression of durability. Hopefully, that won't be a problem. Switches are the weak point in many a flashlight.		I haven't wasted a set of batteries to determine run time. They claim 2.25 hours. I did measure current draw at about 500mA which with a set of Duracell AAA batteries at about a 1000mAh capacity would give 2 hours or so, so that claim seems about right. The light is very bright. Bright enough to be hard to use to read a map when it is shined directly at it. I had to shine it off center a bit to read the map. The light has a very nice tight focus. The lens end of the light has a hexagonal shape that helps it to keep from rolling when laid on a flat surface. There is an included removable lanyard. The rubber switch cover protrudes just slightly from the back. It will stand up on the back end but not solidly. It will wobble a bit.		I'm also hoping that this simple on off switch is truly mechanical so that there is no leakage current on the batteries (other than their own internal leakage due to internal resistance) which may help prevent the flashlight destroyer, white, crusty, potassium carbonate spewage. Someday I swear I will switch back to NiMH or NiCad rechargeables which don't do that.		3 AAA LED flashlights are a dime a dozen nowadays and most of them are pretty much slight variations of the black, machined aluminum variety. While this light doesn't break any new ground it does get the basics right. High intensity for a AAA, simple on/off switch and (claimed) indestructible. It says weatherproof. I don't see any evidence of weather sealing (o-rings) so that is probably "rain resistant" i.e. not submersible. I did take a look at the spring in the end cap and noticed that it was starting to rust which isn't a good sign for a flashlight that is only a few weeks old and has only seen indoor use in the dry Phoenix area. I hope that doesn't affect the contact between the spring and switch prematurely.		I really like this flashlight. It is usually the first one I reach for in general use around the house. Would like it even better if I only paid 12 or 13 dollars for it. One star docked for price to value ratio and a rusty spring.
0,Great price for hard to find green Swiss Army knife.  These are OEM not imitations.
0,A bit big in the wrists...But work ok if still a bit careful...bla bla bla..al  I have to say ...
0,Used this to make a Tron Costume. They don't turn very well you need to splice and solder it. They are bright and work great.
0,These lights looked fantastic in my 1920's Tudor house. Great look and quality fixture
0,Heavy duty and well made.
0,Super nise and easy to replace.
0,Great handle for the price.
0,Neat little light for the price
0,I bought this as an emergency kit for my car, in case I ever came across something where I needed a tool. I liked the size and amount of tools that were included. It also matches my car. Great little as needed kit, for a good price.
0,Nice wire.
0,Very good coverage and dries fast.
0,perfect - works great
0,this flash lite is the best
0,Great product at a really good price.  It didn't fit my table saw slot.
0,I needed to drill 2 holes in my tile floor. As other reviews state, you will need a way to keep the bit in position while you start the hole.  Drilling a hole first in thick cardboard should do the trick. Use a little water periodically for lubrication. Use light pressure and a standard drill, not a hammer drill. Works like a charm. It took about 30 seconds per hole. I drilled 2 holes and I believe the bit still has life left. I don't believe it would hold up to daily use on the job, but if you need a low budget solution for a few holes in a DIY project, it's perfect. By the way, 45 mm is 1 3/4 inches.
0,Haven't had a problem, but I admit I have no scientific way to test them.....
0,Installed easy and works fine.
0,As expected
0,beautiful, fast delivery, everything that was promised. You must do all the steps in the directions for it to stick properly, but when you do, they are wonderful!!!! Easy way to transform a room without paint!
0,Purchased this blade to cut aluminum railing sections with a chop saw and it worked beautifully.
0,These things are great, I work with electronics and often found myself forced to take something apart entirely just to turn a single screw buried inside. This is a good quality inexpensive tool to solve that problem. I would say that the bits for whatever reason have a very long protrusion on the back which still gets in the way, I'm not sure why they put those there. Sometimes I use other shorter bits with them and they work well enough like that as well. Good product. 4 stars only for the long protrusion.
0,As expected. Was well packed and worked to my expectations. I would purchase again.
0,Used for a Straight Edge Jig for the table saw. Initially used for Redwood roughcut lumber - worked great on a plywood sled.
0,Great cheap drill for throwing in the camper or where ever you find it nice to have a cordless drill tucked away.  I would build a house with this or anything. It's a light duty drill with a light duty price
0,Great over the bathroom sink.
0,it is what it says
0,Really quiet. Use it in the workshop for running our sewing machines..excellent piece.
0,I purchased two of these Neiko HVLP Air Spray Guns for my wife's furniture refinishing.  She loves them.  The guns are very high quality and well built.  Easy to clean as well.  I have compared these with the high priced guns at the large home stores, and these are so much better for the money.  You can just see and feel the difference.  Highly recommended.
0,These black lights are more than twice as bright as my standard 60W bulbs from last years Halloween Party.
0,This is old style, oil based enamel, not water based paint like the newer model being sold in some places now. I think this works better on metal that will be exposed to rain and that is why I prefer this oil based paint over the newer water based type being sold now.
0,Very sleek in design and function. I love its monochromatic look, its one finger assisted opening system, and its slim (1/4-inch) thin profile. And, the most important reason for buying a knife has not been overlooked. The blade is razor sharp, out of the box; and it stays sharp. A safety screw, when slid into position, will help prevent unintentional openings. I really am pleased with this knife. However. some people may have an issue with the absence of texture or some overlay to increase the feeling of a firmer grip; but that, in my opinion, would detract from its simple elegance and litheness.
0,Decent product.  In my use in garage, needs to be charged about every 4 weeks.
0,works
0,This is a great hanger that I'm using to hang up my weed eater in my garden shed. It makes it easier to hang it on the wall and saves on floor space. Shipping was also fast.
0,easily if needed ! Greatularge Ferro rod , u can drill Prompt delivery !!  Last for ever !!!!
0,Very nice kit,very good service
0,just what I needed
0,Fantastic quality. We have a 250 pound press on this, rock solid. There is even a support bar for the middle which you cannot see in the photo that makes the top even more sturdy. Highly recommended
0,Had them for a week so far, no problems.  Easy to install...had more trouble getting off old style seats.  Will need a 1/4" wrench or adjustable pliers.  The seats do close slowly...hope the hinges last for years...no more banging..heaven!
0,Everything in this kit is just as described.  The quality of the tool post is excellent, the quality of the chuck is good and all the other pieces are exactly as expected.  It is hard to beat the value and convenience of all of things which are included in this kit.
0,Heavy duty. Created more room in my tool pouch as I got rid of extra screwdrivers
0,The lamp came with adequate directions for assembly which were easy to follow.  It could be assembled in just a few minutes.  It is well-constructed and adequately sturdy and usefully has a fairly long cord.  The threads went in well so that it is standing up straight (if you've ever bought lamps online before, you know how dicey that can be).  The bright light has no glare and provides very good illumination of things on a desk such as one might need for fine work or small print.  My father is temporarily using my lamp amid a move and is particularly excited about the no glare feature, as he wears bifocals and is on the computer a lot.  Most lamps bother him, and he was very enthusiastic that this affordable lamp did not.  The light is adjustable to three brightnesses, which is perfect for a lamp that you're going to have on a lot.  You can leave it on low if you are popping in and out of the office a lot and set it up higher for a particularly intense task.  The lighting is very clear and good for reading and tasks and seeing colors. The dimmer light settings are quite adequate for normal reading material.  I regard it as excellent for an office or craft desk.  It is probably best as task lighting with another warmer colored light shining overhead, but that depends on your preferences.  This lamp will be perfect beside my desk if my dad will give it back to me after my move--haha.  The almond and grey color blends with many backgrounds.  I appreciated the extra color offering, since most of these lamps just come in black or white.  I love that the included bulb is supposed to last twenty years.  I received this lamp at a modest discount in exchange for providing my unbiased review.  Note that my father actually called this lamp "excellent," and he is not that easily pleased nor one for superlatives!
0,Respirator is fantastic! Had to clean a basement with mouse droppings and urine. Couldnt smell a thing. Had to move several bags of trash up and out of basement. Breathing very hard and sweating. Performance is outstanding.
0,The best vise grips I've used in a while.
0,Nice lamp, used in my son's dorm room, looks great.
0,My walls make it hard to hang pictures, but this stuff is fantastic! We used this to hang pictures of all different sizes & it didn't matter where the stud was! It made it much easier to make a nice collage wall. I'm going to send a few boxes to college with my son so he can hang pics in his dorm without causing any wall damage
0,I purchased this tool to remove a plastic safety coating from the front of my RV.  Taking some time, but is working well and doesn't in any way damage the clear coat....
0,as it says 21mm, quality!
0,I have used this product for many years on my garage doors and it has preformed extremely well. I have recommended it to my friends and family members.
0,Purchased this garbage disposal in 2010 just after purchasing our first home.  The device was relatively simple to install for a DIYer and installed within an hour.  After four years, the unit is sill going strong to this day, no issues here.  Would strongly recommend if you are in the market for a solid yet affordable garbage disposal!
0,These fit the bill.  I changed out  locking set for these that don't lock and the problem is solved.  No more kids locking me out of the room.
0,good product, easy to use, instructions on back of packaging.  works well, all my knives now can actually cut and slice!
0,I needed a light for my computer desk at home, but it has very limited space. A regular desk lamp wouldn't really have worked, So I decided that I needed to mount some kind of light underneath the top shelf of the desk. After looking at countless battery powered bar and puck lights, I came to the conclusion that they weren't going to fit the bill. They just weren't bright enough, and by many reports they all dim after very little use. I didn't want to have to constantly be changing batteries, which would require removing the lights on a regular basis. I wanted to fix them in place and be done with it. The problem then became what lights to get that were simple, easy to mount, bright enough without throwing harsh light on my desk, and didn't cost a fortune.		These lights are perfect for that role. They are very small and light, extremely easy to set up. You can use as many or as few of them as you like. (I'm only using two. They throw a perfect amount of light, and I have a spare in case one of them has a problem.) Since my shelf is glass, I actually mounted the lights and the wiring to the underside of the shelf using blue tack. They're not going anywhere.		One problem I had was that the light isn't quite as warm in tone as I would have liked. I came up with a very simple solution to this. Since these are LED lights, they generate almost no heat, so I cut circles of wax paper and taped them over the lights to diffuse some of the light. This helped a little, but the lights were still more on the white side for my tastes. To help with this, I cut two small squares of brown USPS packing tape and placed them in the center of the wax paper circles. This adds a tinge of brownish yellow to the light, and warms it up nicely. For a warmer light you could use larger squares, but I'm happy with how they're fixed for now.		If you're looking for an alternative to battery powered lights, but don't want to mess around with complicated installations or wiring, then these lights are something to consider.
0,These are really nice bags.....I don't use this one for small tools but I keep my glasses, contact case, bill fold, money clip, keys etc. in it. Keeps my pockets empty which I like. High quality.....
0,Great little handy tool. Ordered the Black Oxide, and was impressed with the sturdiness and structure of the Leatherman. However, when I first took it out the box, it left my hands dirty with grease. You may want to put on pair of rubber gloves when you take this out of the box and wipe it down a little.
0,Works perfectly and easy to install.  My daughter installed herself on her college condo door.
0,This was the recommended outlet for the heater I bought from Amazon. All parts and instructions were in package. This outlet is a well made Leviton product.
0,These have great attenuation, but also, seal better than most when used on top of glasses, which is really handy with shooting with loud things.
0,My wife bought this table saw for my birthday and I just used it for the first time this weekend.  It works exactly as I'd hoped.  I've similar DeWalt table saws in the past so i was I generally familiar with how to operate one.		I plan to use this saw for household projects and around the neighborhood (with my neighbors).		I would highly recommend this table saw.
0,This things comes in real handy, there are times where this is much more useful than my 1/2"  flex-head ratchet so I'm glad I bought both. I compared them and the head is only a little bit smaller than the standard flex head so that is disappointing, but it's still very useful since it's a fixed head with a shorter handle.
0,My wife is an avid weaver / seamstress and she's had a hard time finding a work lamp to go next to her sewing machine-- with a soft light that doesn't tire the eyes over time.  This fit the bill perfectly.  And it looks good and is energy-efficient at the same time.
0,My Lift Master garage door opener works great. It is a good range of about 100 feet which is more than enough. I am very happy and it was not very costly. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL
0,This unit is an excellent choice if  you have a well. With a little help from a friend the unit was easy to install. This unit does have some weight to it so you will want to anchor it to studs. Filters are easy to change,always have extra o rings on hand. Overall for the price this is a wise choice.
0,These bulbs are great!  I have been using them to replace the CFL bulbs my builder installed.  I learned about Hyperikon when an electrician friend recommended them.  I order the 4 packs and when I get low, I just order another 4 pack.  The light amount is perfect, the color is as described, and the price is superb.  Highly recommend.
0,Tell me I'd be paying about twelve bucks for a candelabra style bulb five years ago and I would have thought you were crazy. Actucally, LED prices are slowly dropping, and this Kobi K8L6 is going for less than comparable bulbs once listed for. That said, after the initial investment, it pays for itself quickly in energy savings. LEDs are supposed to last 'forever' and I can't speak to that on a week or two into use, but I'm hopeful it will work for the long haul.		For an LED, the color is surprisingly warm. The light seems to dim a big near the tip, but that isn't a major concern. Overall it provides uniform light and is brighter than its wattage might suggest. The bottom of the bulb isn't overly attractive, but screwed into a socket, most of it isn't visible to the casual glance. It runs cool and I can touch the bulb with no fear of burning myself even after it has been on for hours. I'm also glad that if this were to somehow break, I wouldn't need to worry about its poisonous innards like I would if it were a CFL bulb.		~ Kort
0,As described, it seem small at first glance but it does the job like any of the cumbersome brands out there. Small but effective...
0,looks good ,cuts 1/8 sq tube very well ,blade doesn't seem high quality but this is my first go with a chop saw, cut true ,45 are dead on,project took less 30 min to cut up.
0,works as advertised, quick and easy
0,Love it . Water pressure is better than my previous faucet . The spray option has a wide sweeping pattern that works very well . Seems very well made and kind of heavy duty .
0,These are great!  Low price and do exactly what I need them to do.  Haven't measured them for accuracy but I am only using them occasionally for making custom additions to homebrew pots and electrical control boxes for brewing and other projects.  Not sure if they would hold up in a professional environment but perfect for the weekend warrior/DIYer.
0,I have to say I Love this. It is a gift for my brother in law but I had to get a sneak peak. It is so well made. It looks exactly as it does in the pictures. The light is attached to the top which has a metal chain for hanging. The cord isn't super long but it is still perfect. It also arrived way before the expected delivery date which was even better.
0,We did a mini-makeover.  Chose this style. It is beautifully elegant, and we have since changed all of our outlet covers/wall plates to this design. You won't be disappointed.  You wouldn't think that something so little could update and change a room's look, so much.
0,Easy install, works great.
0,I think I will be selling my air impact guns at this point, these impact guns work better than my air operated ones, plus you don't have to drag around an air hose.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone who has to turn wrenches for a living, the 1/2" one is a bit heavy, but really not much heavier than an air impact.  Ive used mine to change tires, break loose stuck bolts, assembly work, etc
0,A nice change of pace for the powder room without getting too fussy.  Good quality build and easy to install.  Easy to clean as well.
0,Love the set and the organizing case... an area when it comes to tools where I need all the help I can get.
0,great cabinet, just what i needed
0,I bought this along with Solar Group SDPK0000 Black Heavy-Duty Steel Drive-In Mailbox Post Kit and it was easy to set up with basic tools. It is big even for a rural community and I noticed that most of my neighbors had much smaller mailboxes. I should have probably gotten a smaller one but it works.
0,This knife is beautiful.  It is almost too pretty to take fishing and take a chance on losing it.  the brass needed a touch up after unwrapping with a bit of copper polish but with a few rubs gleamed wonderfully.  The most impressive part of this knife is its rosewood handle....it is polished to the point of looking like the rosewood on my guitar.  All this is topped off with a very pointy (moderately honed) blade and a fine leather sheath.  A++ in my opinion.
0,This is an exceptional battery powered motion detecting light. When motion no longer detected in darkened areas light goes out promptly within 15-20 Seconds.  Will likely order another one of these. Highly recommended.	Excellent construction - Made in China.	Thumbs up.
0,Very nice!
0,Thanks!
0,Seems to be working fine.
0,thanks i enjoy doing business with you all,keep up the good work.the iitem was in good shap, every thing was on time
0,Does good in measuring and squaring. One draw back, the scratching tool falls out of the hole.  It needs something to retain the scratching tool so it won't get lost.  I had to put it in container to keep from loosing it then I have to go searching for it when I need it.
0,I bought this part for the bathroom fan.  Very easy change and much better than buying a new ceiling fan.
0,Always good quality components
0,Its a ground bar and my stuff is grounded.
0,A few years back we bought a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Moen-T6125BN-Kingsley-Two-Handle-High-Arc-Bathroom-Faucet-without-Valve-Brushed-Nickel/dp/B001003SDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Moen T6125BN Kingsley Two-Handle High Arc Bathroom Faucet without Valve, Brushed Nickel</a>&nbsp;at a local store to replace a leaky 18-year-old faucet. (No replacement parts available, Mr. Remodeling Contractor, thank you very much.)		We loved it so much that when our 20-year-old faucet started leaking - surprise! - I got one of these things from Amazon for the master bath. Rude shock: this wasn't what we bought a couple years ago. This kit only includes what you can see above the sink. The, uh, plumbing part isn't in the box. You MUST acquire a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Moen-9000-M-PACT-Widespread-Lavatory-Rough-In-Valve-with-Drain-Assembly/dp/B000T7Q6OI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Moen 9000 M-PACT Widespread Lavatory Rough-In Valve with Drain Assembly</a>&nbsp;to have the whole works. I can't imagine this faucet/spout set is compatible with anything but the Moen 9000 stuff.		The installations instructions are right out of Fahrenheit 451: no words. Well, there are a few, but... Anyway, there are a couple things not too well explained. First, the valves are initially supported from the top by snap-rings. Don't over-tighten the nuts underneath! I danged near busted the first one by reefing on the wrench. Second, the very beautiful spout bolts to a brass fitting below, slipping over a brass pipe equipped with a couple O-rings. Here's where the instructions become, well, just a little TOO terse: I think you should start the installation of the spout before you install the center brass fitting in the rough-in kit. Just a turn or two of the brass bolt that holds the spout down on the sink. The instructions don't say that because... (wait for it)... this kit and the rough-in kit are TWO SEPARATE PRODUCTS. Never mind that you need both to do the installation. Never mind that putting a cross-reference on both sets of instructions would clear up the mystery. SO, I thought I'd have to disassemble the rough-in work. (At this point I said some bad words.)		 If you look CAREFULLY at the instructions, you might actually observe that the provided Allen wrench can be inserted in the hole for the drain-stop knob/shaft/whatever. (When I was doing the rough-in, I spent about 20-30 minutes observing the under-sink stuff, including the bottom end of the bolt. It has a hex socket in it, and I thought that assembly had to be done from underneath. I missed the Allen-wrench trick in the comics for the top-side assembly. Again, a cross-reference would have been really helpful.) So, a little of the provided lube for the O-rings, a few more bad words while getting the brass bolt to correctly start in the threads of the spout, and about 87 1/3-turns-to-tighten later, the spout was securely installed.		 I'm a little unhappy with the plastic valve bodies, and the plastic hoses, in the rough-in kit. The bases of the faucets screw onto the plastic valve bodies, and that is what REALLY supports the valve from the top. I don't like plastic, particularly in plumbing. Hooking up the hoses is really fast, though! Uh, well, it is if you make sure that the in-feed tubes on the valves don't point directly at each other: you have to rotate the valve bodies so there is room to plug everything together. Trust me.		Other than all that, gee whiz, these sure are pretty faucets! I actually do like them. My wife is happy, so I'm happy.
0,Good, reliable, heavy duty timer.  What I like about the mechanical timer is that it will continue to work after a power outage, though the timing will be off by whatever duration power was out.
0,Easy use
0,Work great and look really nice in the fixtures. I love the bright, WHITE light these give up. It makes things look so much more natural. Planning to replace all the bulbs in our house with these lights! Great product!
0,Not high quality, it's in a guest room
0,Excellent way to dress up a room without a ton of money.  Looks great.  Every bit as good as I had hoped.
0,A very nice sink.  I bought it for my shop because it is fabricated from heavier gauge SS sheet metal, I didn't want a thin walled sink that would dent if I dropped something into it.  When I got it I was surprised at how well made and attractive it is and feel bad (sort of) that I am using such a beautiful and well made sink in my shop.  I just finished fabricating the cabinet and hooking it up to water and waste.
0,Be sure you are looking for something that will hold a very small item. If you are looking to store something as long as a screwdriver, this is not it. These will store small items like nuts, bolts, screws... smaller objects. They are good for that. But just realize, they are small.
0,The color coded paper that came with it doesn't really match up, the colors are not the same. The sanders work fine, I used them for wet sanding plastic and they worked fine, just make sure they have a chance to dry, mine have held up fine.
0,great little saw at a good price.
0,Finally a fantastic LED accent light bulb.  Installed them in my new WAC Lighting Radiant H Series Line Voltage Track Head HTK-773.  I used it with a WAC Lighting HMP 5.3" Square Monopoint Canopy.  Sends out a focused beam of light with great color.  Dimmable too.  Bulb is just the right length for the fixture.  A very successful installation.
0,Beautiful finish.  I would definitely purchase this product again.
0,Perfect for around the house or for your admin assistant.
0,This is the correct bulb to use with legacy dimmer switches.  It is incandescent, but somewhat more efficient than a standard incandescent.  In my fixture, they dim smoothly from full light down to nothing.  So-called dimmable LED bulbs go down about half way and start flickering.
0,Works excellent in my 4x6 chicken coop.  My chickens are  staying warm and calm.  Recommend for keeping critters warm in cold weather.  I use the thermostat plug in with it.. Turns on at 35 degrees and off at 45 degrees.	Bought the double plug off Amazon too.
0,Bought these for my second remodel job. WIll buy again -a third time.	Installs & works exactly as they should. Easy to reverse the handles.
0,These are beautiful and work as described. They do work in light sockets controlled by motion sensors. I am going to buy more for outdoor use. I can do a lightshow for Christmas.
0,Works great!
0,I received this tool just in time to do a minor remodeling job in our bathroom.  I wasn't planning on using this kind of tool, but I was killing myself trying to loosen and remove some hard plastic coupling nuts under our two sinks.  I had tried everything else to get the nuts off, so I decided to cut them off.  I could  have used my Dremel which would  have worked but it would have taken a long time.  Being  under a sink is not so comfortable, so I broke out this Rotozip to try out.  It tore through the nuts like butter, although I wasn't prepared for the tool's loudness.  Also it's pretty hefty.  I also used it to cut some drywall holes before doing some tile work.  I doubt I'll use this more than a couple of times a year, but I'm glad I have this in my tool inventory.
0,Does an excellent job. Must have if you own a home with high ceiling bulb
0,Bought 12 of these (three packs of four, that is) for our kitchen remodel. They went in easy, and work perfectly.
0,Necessary when you need them
0,Exactly what I was looking for. I used it every day. And it was $20 less on Amazon than at the factory store.
0,i charged this light w/sunlight for 3 days based on other reviews ive read..  there is a small on/off button that can only be pushed with a pen.. the light shines very bright and is very sensative.. works great..
0,I've been installing these for years and have stuck with them.  I'm glad this product hasn't changed much because it's pretty easy to work with and you can choose from different styles on the trim.
0,Great light to carry, or give as gift
0,Good finish, solid product. One star short as the included screws were half inch shorter than required for the drawer. Ended up using the old screws
0,My wife is thrilled with her new LED lighted library cabinets.  Very simple to use and installation was so easy.  I highly recommend this product.  I have purchase 3 additional sets as gifts to my best friends and they share my opinion.  To my knowledge, no other LED  lighting product comes close to this price and performance.  Google 14 foot LED to learn more.
0,I looked all over for a 2 hole punch, and nobody seems to sell them except the office stores, and they were over $17 at Office Max!  So I went to Amazon and was thrilled not to have to exchange my firstborn for one.  It works great, doesn't slip around, and folds away into a drawer when not in use.  What more could you want?
0,The cover is not the easiest to install but looks good, and feels good. I can actually drop my gun and have nothing to worry about, feels protected.
0,good item
0,Love!  These were difficult to install even for the electrician that I hired but are stunning in my rooms. The transparent outer shade really adds a sophisticated essence. They are inexpensive enough that hiring the electrician was still worth it!
0,Just what they said they would be.  Note that with the 5000 K color temp, these are very white.  If you want warm white, don't buy these, buy a lower color temp like 3000 or 3500 degrees.
0,Needed something easy to use to burn ropes for my business.  It heats up quickly and cools off quickly.  Works great.
0,Tiny and bright	Perfect for a key chain...clip it on with your keys and you hardly know it's there	I am positive this will serve it's purpose, & looks like it will last a long time.	This light has a tuff coating on an aluminum case, but don't think that it won't	Get marked up rattling around with your keys.	It will work when you need it	Great as part of your survival gear!
0,Good Kit, Good Price
0,Similiar to the Palidin wire strippers, works Great!
0,The installation is very easy with the use of a single screw in the corner of the door. The only issue was that it seems to move from its location during the screwing. Otherwise, it worked perfect and with such great price I am happy.
0,I have been hesitant to write this review because SmartHome devices in general have been pretty sketchy in terms of bringing actual improvements to market.  Lots of promises, but rarely do these devices fully deliver.		I've been using WeMo devices now for almost a year.  It started simply with the insight switch because I wanted to turn on a room heater in the morning before I got into my office and has grown into two additional insight outlets, a switch, two motion detectors, and three bulbs.		I can honestly say, when WeMo first launched, it was touch and go if anything actually worked when you wanted it to.  But with recent firmware and software improvements, my WeMo devices all work flawlessly.  When I first started installing WeMo devices, it was a pain, now even that has dramatically improved.  My most recent purchase of WeMo bulbs and the link were installed and up and running in a matter of minutes.		The best thing about WeMo is its integration with IFTTT, this simple and easy to use app allows you to write " recipes" for different devices and services.  For example, my family uses the free tracking app Life360, which essentially is free OnStar.  I know when someone leaves and using IFTTT, when the last person leaves the house, I can set to turn on and off lights as I want, all automatically.  It literally "just works".		Now I also have two wink devices, the z-wave outdoor switch.  I use these for my patio lights because WeMo doesn't have an outdoor compatible switch.  Wink is much more unreliable.  And the app is buggy and overly complicated.  Worst of all, no IFTTT integration.  My lights some times turn on, other times they stay on all night.  Worst of all, wink is much more susceptible to weak wifi.  WeMo is no pro here either.  If you have weak wifi, buy a booster if you plan on making your home a smart home.		For now, I'm going to stick to WeMo and see what they come up with next.
0,I am impressed overall with these strippers. I use a lot of different gauges of wire at work and this thing tackles them all. The spring is very sturdy and seems to take a lot of punishment as I have used this tool countless times. I like the build very much and its ease of use. I even used them the other evening to strip the coating off a twist tie for the wire.
0,nice saw-plenty of power for the things I will be doing.  One of the cast metal feet was broken but there is enough platform left for it to work safely, just can't bolt it down. I wasn't going to do that anyway.  All in all a good buy.
0,I love the size and the fact that the lens is glass not plastic.  Battery life isn't the greatest, but AA batteries are inexpensive and they are easy to change.  Nice light to have on hand at all times.
0,I recommend these.  I have only used them maybe 10 times so far but no problems to report.  Easy to use.  It stays in place well for me.  The strap can be a little uncomfortable after wearing for hours.  It could use a disposable or washable sweat band across the forehead.  I have not seen any headlight with that feature so it is not at a competitive disadvantage that way.  I use a rag then things are fine.  If the light had a bit more adjustment range it would be a good thing,  not that this is bad at all just maybe it could be slightly better in that small way.		For china made it really gives no sign of breaking and that is a real positive.		I think most would be reasonably happy with this simple quality light.		Jay
0,Nice
0,This is far superior to anything from hardware stores for Awlgrip paint. Why are they not available in a shorter nap? These need to be 1/8 inch nap to reduce the about of paint lost to just load it up.
0,Awesome, use it all the time when I smoke my pipe. Honestly you don't need anything fancy to smoke a pipe but the fact that this is on my keys and I always have it on me is priceless. Durable too.
0,nice !
0,good
0,Excellent product and works great, even with my less-than-stellar woodworking skills. I purchased this to complete a hope chest project for my daughter and this works perfectly. I didn't have to use my jointer at all for the project thanks to the quality of the cut I could obtain using this blade. 4/4 cherry was the lumber used and this cut through it perfectly with no burn marks and no chipping at the end of the cut. Sucks having to buy two blades (crosscut and rip) but in the end it was well worth the costs for the quality of the cuts and how well the projected turned out.
0,great!!
0,Works well for my needs.
0,You will wonder what you did without it. Much heavier than the $100 cheapo that I used for twenty years, this one should outlive several generations and may last in to the 22nd century.
0,Same exact vise head that the dealers sell, but at a much better price.  Fits perfectly in my old PanaVise base, works great.
0,This was my sixth Anniversary unit.  I have them all with different bits or drills when in the middle of a project.  Saves time and effort.  Like their power and the metal case.  Have one in a plastic case, it works as well and is lighter but prefer the metal case.
0,works like a charm, saves my back from wrestling with a heavy gate.
0,worth it. must have for confidence for any work to do it right. don't risk damaging whatever your working on without this tool.
0,The 1/2 inch door viewers give a much better view. Worth the effort to swap this out. All you need is a drill bit to drill the 1/2 inch hole. If you can't remove the old viewer, there's a style of drill bit shaped like cylinder that will cut around the old one.
0,Loved it.very usefull. I bought 3 of them....
0,Good
0,The battery life is outstanding.  The strength and torque is perfect for every job that I have used it for.  It is comfortable to hold and is light weight.  What a gem.
0,easy install, cheaper quality hose a bit short
0,Nice product
0,Great buy
0,I have more cordless (carpenters') tools than seems reasonable.  It may be an indicator of some mental disorder, but it's not hurting anyone...right?  For quite a while I would prioritize purchasing a tool that included a hard case, the drawback of this approach soon became apparent.  Yes, they provide excellent protection from getting knocked about in transport, but unless I was prepared to buy a pan-tec, the unnecessary volume they occupy would be crippling.	The answer to that conundrum turned out to be simpler than I first thought. I didn't like the idea of throwing several tools in one soft bag, might as well just chuck em in the back of the wagon.  Individual soft bags however is an excellent solution.  I have several small GateMouth tool bags which hold one tool and it's accessories. A simple colored tag tells me what is where without having to wear-out my unzipping skills. Bags can be thrown in (theoretically, cos I'm way too 'anal' for that sort of carry-on!) and seem to nest together without any puzzle-making expertise. These bags get a big YES from me!
0,I keep it in my car since I don't like stuff hanging from my 3 key-keyring. It snaps on a hook in there with the attached. Perfect size-great little gift for anyone!
0,GREAT!  Small, balanced, and well built. At a fair price too.  The otherwise quality cloth case, on the other hand, is a bit awkward in the way it zips closed.  That said, I'm 99.999% satisfied.
0,What a neat device. There are slots to hold the bit and pin guide in the back compartment. There is also another slot if you want a second bit. I wish there was a spot to hold the allen key (that'd only make sense...). It's cool that you can attach additional jigs too. My only complaint is that the piece used to attach additional jigs only came with 4 of the 6 screws needed for it. The instructions illustrate 6 being used, why wouldn't it come with all 6 then?
0,What more can you say? It is inexpensive, and it holds the toilet paper, just as it is supposed to.
0,Nice knife,not too pricey,not built noticably "cheap" either,good knife to throw in a go bag -or- bug-out bag and forget about it.	Sheath is average,but for the cost cant expect much more.	All in all,happy enough with it.
0,Allowed me to add another three-way circuit WITHOUT having to expand my electrical boxes
0,Well made , perfect.
0,After doing some research I definitely wanted a dual sensor smoke alarm which this is.  My understanding is that it is more likely to catch different types of fires like open flame vs slow smoldering.  We bought an older house that only had one alarm.  I decided that wasn't good enough in case that one ever failed we would be in trouble if we ever had a fire.  So, I got three of these to add to the house.  Installation and battery insertion is very easy.  The other question is... do they work?  Yes, they do... we were cooking in the oven and food bubbled out onto the oven elements causing smoke.  They did there job and went off.  But, once I took them outside they immediately stopped beeping.  So, they definitely work!
0,So heres the deal.  I had been thinking about getting one of these for a while now, and I finally pulled the trigger.  Its one of those things that might be considered strange in America (only because its different) so you get a vast array of reactions to it when new people use your bathroom.  What is that thing on your toilet? A bidet? I thought those were only for women. Or when my dad saw it, he couldn't resist turning it on and it shot across the bathroom onto the opposite wall.  Its definitely different but in the absolute best way possible.  I had feared the reactions of people when I put it on and then decided I didn't really care and it was worth the try. Im so glad I did, because now Im disappointed when I have to take care of the daily double on a toilet without my bidet.		I have been using this for several months now and I can assure you its not just a fad.  I save toilet paper and save myself from those times where it just seems like theres a brown marker down there and you just keep wiping and wiping and wiping.  Water is a lot more friendly and cleanly than paper.  I also want to offer some reassurance for those still on the fence about the whole thing.  Its a concentrated stream, its not like its a car wash for your undercarriage.  So you're not soaked after you use it or anything. Just turn it on, let it run for 10-20 seconds and 1 wipe to get the minimal water off and you're done!  I know its taboo to talk about this kind of thing, but its something that everyone does on a regular basis and has to deal with.		Heres some of my thoughts on choosing which model: I had initial concerns about it being only cold water, but the water in your lines is really not that cold unless you leave it on for a while.  Even then, its pretty refreshing, and not uncomfortable in the slightest.  Also, theres no way I wanted to run a hot water line to my toilet.  Another reason I chose this model is because it had the cleaning function.  You can turn the dial to clean and then run water over the spouts.  This is a nice feature just to keep it clean, because it is in a toilet after all. I wouldnt say its an absolute must, but I appreciate that its there.  This one also has a selection for women, which is nice for the whole diversity thing. I didn't want my toilet to have any discrimination.		The one word of warning I have is make sure you turn it on slow.  I haven't even made it to medium pressure before, but I swear this thing could give you an enema.  I cant say its perfect, but its pretty darn close and I don't know why Ive went so long without one.
0,works as expected
0,PROS::: Super bright and a very wide spread of light. I love how it covers half a room when you are standing at one end and turn it on. It is very solidly made, and even comes with extra o-rings to make it/keep it water resistant (Thought honestly I would say water proof, I did not test it out and will not do so! But it works in the rain without issue at all. Even disassembled it to make sure it was dry. IT WAS!) the ultra clear lens makes sure the light transfers through without issue, and you can see the build quality when you do. I absolutely love it. I'm a "Flashlight guy" so I have had all kinds, from all manufactures and all manner of technologies when it comes to lights. I've been that way since I was a kid and bought my first Mag Lite at a trade show at 8. Hey, I was hooked for no apparent reason. I mean, aside from being able to see in the dark as if it was light out. Which, honestly, is pretty darn cool. This flashlight sets that bar higher, with the ability to zoom WAY out so it floods the whole area with bright, white, light. That is an outstanding thing. I love the charger that comes with it, it is pretty decent and does the job. It does NOT charge the batteries too quickly, which is good for Li-Ion batteries. Takes standard 18650s that fit and charge with no troubles at all. The fact it comes with TWO 18650 (Which it uses both, it's a dual battery flashlight) is fantastic, and I love it. Granted I do have extras, but that is super handy. And being able to charge two at once now is fantastic for me.	CONS:: Typical, square light when you zoom all the way in. ALL zoomable flashlights that I have had, do this. Doesn't matter if they are super expensive or super cheap. For some reason no one uses the round XML-T6's that I have on other flashlights that do NOT zoom. I don't know why, but it does annoy me slightly. I want round light, even zoomed in. That's just me	The little flashlight that comes with it is nothing to write home about, it's not BAD, but not great. IT WILL NOT WORK WITH fully charged 14500 3.7v batteries, so it seems to only function with AA batteries, which is okay, just would be better if it took 14500s also. Just for the extra brightness. They zoom also, with very little flood and the same square zoomed in light.	This is a FANTASTIC set, and I cannot knock off a star for the square, as I said, all of them are that way that zoom. I received these at a discount in exchange for testing and review, and since I dislike being misled, I am 100% honest!`
0,I've been using this blade on my table saw, to cut limestone blocks.  This blade cuts them like butter.  I've cut probably 70 linear feet of solid stone, at the maximum depth, and the blade cuts just as well now as it did on the first cut.  I was worried that the dust might kill the motor on my saw (a cheap Skil table saw), but no problems at all.		I do wish this blade had a 5/8" arbor hole.  It comes with a brass insert to bring the hole down to 5/8", but the insert is a bit thinner than the blade and is a bit stubborn going in.  Additionally, my blade had about 1/16" of wobble when mounted on my saw.  To be fair, I can't tell if the blade is warped, or if I just didn't get it clamped into my arbor quite right.  I tried to remount it a couple of times with no luck, but it could well be my saw and not the blade.  The cuts were fine regardless, albeit with a bit wider kerf and more saw marks than you might expect.  This was no problem for my purposes.		If I were to buy again, I'd probably pay a few dollars more for a saw with the 5/8" arbor that I need.  Other than that, no complaints.
0,Very nice heavy cord..
0,works as it should, so far
0,Nice when for situations where I need a more stable grip than my normal clamp clips won't do!
0,Fantastic bulb and was exactly what I was looking for.  However, the bulbs I received were 30-Watt and not the 20-Watt as advertised.  This is the only reason I'm giving it 4 of 5 starts....so buyer beware if the 10 watts matter.
0,Exactly What I Needed - Decent Value - Solid Quality - At 7" inches Long  With Thick Handles These Brushes Are Designed For Both Light & MEDIUM Duty Work.		Not Much More TO Say other than I'm Pleased  with this purchase.
0,Graet knife high quality its a steel for the price
0,Really easy setup, as I just match the colors from the switch to the ones in the wall. Switching out the front cover is really simple as well, but I kept the white on. The indicator light is great for any room that needs a little guiding light to where it is, when entering a dark room. the dimmer is simple and precise.  Leviton makes a good solid switch with many options.
0,these are badass works flawlessly i got 3
0,excellent, quick ship, exactly as described.
0,Great for bigger projects
0,Very nice
0,Great little product in lieu of a bidet. It is effective as an added hygiene product for those times when your personal plumbing is a bit off. The self cleaning feature on it seems to work really well too. It'll really get your attention though if you don't connect it to a warm water supply... which I did.		Update: This little guy worked rather well for about 8 months and then it seems to have clogged and there was no way to get it cleaned out without major surgery. I put it in the recycle bin and picked up a different brand and see how well it holds up.
0,Just what I needed, it worked great.
0,Great night light.
0,A very well designed tool that comes with no belt pouch or clip on the knife. It's pretty heavy for flopping around in the bottom of a pocket so either I buy an accessory pouch, make one and/or wish they would make these knives with a pocket clip. Still it's a nice tool.
0,Yeow!		(bright light, bright light!)		It does exactly what it is said to do. I didn't play with the "focus" feature yet though.		It's like a portable spotlight!
0,Great tool for tight places. Wish I had bought it years ago.
0,I have had this flashlight for about a year. I replaced a Ryobi rechargeable that kept blowing the bulb every time I knocked it over. This flashlight has been dropped from the attic; no problem. It's not the brightest flashlight I've owned, but works fine for normal tasks.
0,I love this headlamp! It fits well and the light tilts to wherever you need it to see. I bought this to use if we get caught in another hurricane this year and are without electricity!
0,I built a swing gate for the top of my stairs on my deck to keep our dog from running away when we are on the deck with her. It is held closed by a magnet. I initially used a magnetic cabinet latch, but that rusted and lost its magnetism in a month. Looked for a rust proof latch and could not find one. Found this product. It's slightly larger than a quarter. Could not install it so both sides were over each other due to the gate configuration. One side is about 1/4 inch over the other side, but yet it still has great magnetic holding power. I really have to pull on the gate to open it. Great solution.
0,could be a little brighter but overall good product
0,So far so good. Great little light and seems to hold a good charge. Very handy on the key ring and quite bright for the size.
0,Power pack seems to be well made and was easy to set up. I ordered this power pack as the previous ones I have used from a different maufacturer only lasted about two years. I hope I get more life out of this brand.
0,Great
0,This is one heavy-duty drill chuck, and with the short arbor, is most useful in the tailstock of my Nova Comet lathe.		A great product from a good littlemachineshop = check out their catalog for many more tools you can use!
0,I bought this in the middle of finishing our basement. I borrowed a 12 inch Dewalt that worked ok, but I had to give that back and bought the Hitachi. Maybe just because it was a newer blade, but it cut cleaner than the Dewalt. I really liked the size of it as well.		I used it to cut 2x4 studs, and to do a lot of baseboard/trim cutting, and it worked fantastic. I've bought a couple other Hitachi tools (hammer drill & circular saw), and I have been nothing but pleased at how well they worked, and the value that you get for the price.		At the current price from Amazon, maybe not such a great deal, but Lowe's has this on sale from time to time at $99. It is worth every bit at that price.
0,A fine product.
0,These are wonderful. You can direct water in any direction, extend to desired length, plus they are easily hidden or disguised.
0,I recently changed a 2mm clutch cable on my motorcycle - cutting the excess was a giant pain!		I did a search for something that would do the trick easier and with less fuss - and here it is!		Test cuts on the same type of cable went flawlessly and very easy. This cutter does the trick on clutch/brake cables with zero problem.
0,I purchased this seat to go with the Kohler Cimarron toilet. They work very well.  I highly recommend this product.
0,all as advertised; I'd buy again if the need came up
0,Really good flashlight at a great price.
0,This is the easiest way to hang picture, clock's anything that needs to be hung on the wall and not have to work to put it up
0,I bought this to match a knife made from the Woodcraft "Tanto" hunting knife kit.  It fit perfectly, though the snap closure over the handle was a bit tight for the handle I made.  This was readily resolved by using neatsfoot oil and allowing the leather to dry while snapped on the knife with some tape wrapped over the handle to stretch the leather.  I ordered a second for the another of the same knife kit.
0,I use this for shaping dog nails. After clipping this shapes even the toughest  nails very nicely. If they are still pretty short you can skip the clipping and just do a shape up. Just a slight touch to the nail is all it takes, nothing longer or it could hurt. Helps you get a nicely shaped smooth nail. The charge lasts long enough to get all four feet,... about 20 minutes.
0,Product was as discribed and I am satisfied with my purchase and with the sellers service.
0,Real wood and strong. It was easy to put up.
0,Get price....great quality
0,Nice inexpensive basic plate, does it's job and looks to be of decent quality.  Have had it installed for approximately 6 months now with no signs of wear or other issues.
0,I don't use one of these very much but it seems to work fine. Occasional repair job around shop.
0,This well designed and easy to install. It took me about 15 minutes to put in and I'm not a professional or anything. It really cuts down on the clutter of having power blocks for chargers sitting around. It comes with a white cover plate which I didn't use because I had a metal one. It fits into a standard junction box.
0,Ive owned many of these throughout the years. They work so well that I keep giving them away. But my sons are grown so now I have one I can keep. I keep this in my SUV and only need to recharge it maybe once a week. Very durable and dependable light. Works every time and just as bright with each time I turn it on!
0,Good product from Fluke, as always.
0,The KOHLER K-10411- CP Forte is one great faucet!  KOHLER Company is and always will be the best.  They do stand behind there products 100 percent.
0,What you expect.
0,Nice no heat light,nice C7 size,I am hoping it will last a long time.
0,works well enough
0,I buy these all the time to give as gifts.  I use one every day at work, at home, and keep one in my purse for spontaneous needs.  It works for just about everything you'd use a large box cutter for.  I buy the replacement blades every time I order one of the mini box cutters.
0,very good
0,Work good
0,Company was great it was not what I needed but exactly as described
0,I purchased two of these and the installation was quick and easy.  They are easy to set. Visited many websites including Honeywell and this was a match for Empire gas heaters that use Mv thermostats.
0,Wonderful little welder. It made short work of the repairs I needed to make on my lawntractor deck. Very easy to strike an arch, the digital read out makes dialing in the amperage a snap, the stinger holds a death grip on a 6013 rods, and the ground clamp is very rigid and has a vise like grip. Great product and even better price.
0,This is a wonderful knife and takes an edge well. I have carried the larger version of this knife but in many places it was not allowed due to its size. This knife is a good size to have and is of good quality. Opens easily but takes some practice to be able to close it with one hand. I use this knife frequently and seems to keep its edge. The handle is shaped well and the surface makes it easy to hang on to.  I would highly recommend this knife to others
0,Love it...
0,This work perfectly with the associated pipe clamp. They were promptly shipped in the same package. A thing to know is that the clamp package says to get a piece of pipe cut 7" longer that the item you are clamping. I did this, and also paid $2 to have the other end of the other pipe piece threaded so I would have other size options. Great set.
0,These are nice and bright, much better than the others ones I tried.
0,Arrived on time, installed real easy and bright nice improvement
0,Excellent sockets, CR-MO steel.
0,If you hand sharpen drill bits it's a must for accuracy.
0,Great for fine precision work	Also use it to grind my dog's nails, he likes the extension since the	Dremel itself is loud
0,There are 4 IPhones in my home and the owners have stopped stealing each others chargers.	I put one in my guest room so visitors can use it.	I even put one in my workshop so can use my phone for music.	If I could just get them to stop stealing each others cords.
0,Work a million times better then an aluminum gutter nail. A drill makes it a snap.
0,Great for checking power draw on plugin devices.
0,High quality plates and excellent coloring/paint.
0,Excellent quality and easy to use right out of the box.  Used occasionally for household projects and perfect for both me and my husband.
0,Nice polish on the surface.  Used a second wrench on it, to give me more leverage, and it performed as expected.
0,its a must with the dust guard attactment
0,I like the design of these clamps and they seem to work very well.  The feet are a especially nice when working with furniture on a raised platform.
0,LUCECO 4k light	Its low profile design with easy to use mounting hardware make it ideal for any space you wish to light thoroughly	[...]
0,Individually wrapped with protective material (not just the plastic). Look great in upscale kitchen remodel
0,A little device that makes the device you want to control wireless.
0,This was PERFECT!  I'm an older female, not in the best of health.  I can't really afford to hire painters, nor do I want to turn my home upside down, but I don't have the physical stamina to turn the house upside down myself.  This little thing was perfect.  I just painted my kitchen with a mini-roller that fit perfectly in the handheld bucket with matching liner.  I just put a little paint in there at a time, painted for a little while.. when I got tired, I was out of paint anyway!  Wrap the roller in plastic so it doesn't dry out, relax a while, then get back to it.  It was great - painted the kitchen all by myself in one weekend with very little mess to clean up!!
0,Easy to install and loved how they looked.
0,I am only on my knee for short intervals.  But, it is nice to have a little padding for my old knees when I need it.  The pads stay hidden and barely noticeable through my pants.  You may need to trim the bottom of the pad a little to fit into the knee pockets of your pants.  But, once trimmed the pads stay in place until needed.  A great break on your old knees!!
0,good
0,Was exactly what I needed :)
0,very nice!
0,Very bright and work great.
0,I use this light inside a Japanese garden lantern in my back yard. It's small enough to fit in the very confined space, gives off a very pleasing light  and provides a bit of security in my backyard without being garish. The cord is long and thin enough that it was easy to conceal the photoelectric panel at a distance from the lantern. The best features are the self-charging and the automatic on/off.  Highly recommended wherever a low-level of outdoor illumination is needed.
0,Beautiful design and well made.
0,Easy to install, bright white (not blue) /daylight lights. Perfect with this dimmer (http://amzn.to/2nT7Pbe) as one of the recommended models by the seller and I couldn't be happier.  Using these in a recording studio for overhead lighting and will add more now that I've tested these out.
0,Great inspirational plaque
0,The signal travels 81 feet from the garage and into the basement. More sound choices than I'll ever use along with individual volume settings on each receiver.
0,Purchased this product to try under the kitchen cabinets and improve lighting on the kitchen counter top-- works perfectly!!!!  The options for On, Off and Auto are wonderful- as that gives control over how much, how often we need the light.  Works well as night lite too. It is very sensitive - lights up at 10-12 feet or more pending angle.  The entire bar can be adjusted to aim the 'beams' and the sensor adjusts giving some control over it's sensitivity to motion. Lighting is bright- perfect for working on counter top, reading recipes etc is easy! It is screw mounted - so we know it securely placed and it also slides easily to side so it can be taken down for battery change too!  Very pleased with this product!!!!  Considering a second purchase.  A satisified customer!!
0,A cheap replacement for what I needed. Fairly quiet and enough power for your basic usage. Would buy again...for now.
0,My Hakko FX888 has excellent performance, it works perfectly and meets my requirements, its design is small and fits anywhere, and I just use it to repair a 50-inch TV.		My only comment is that it only comes with a single soldering iron tip.
0,Very good quality pivots well clamp is also strong price is great
0,Seemed like a nice piece of hardware.
0,These work great.  You don't need Teflon tape, they do not leak, and the swivel feature makes using your air tool way more convenient.  Don't even bother looking at any other items.  This is the set to get.  And there are 6 of them.  Probably enough for all your air tools.
0,Always loved Dewalt brand and will always buy Dewalt when it comes to my blades and grinders.
0,This light is very bright, can be programed with a computer, has many options, lasts a long time in use.
0,Excellent product, fast shipping, Great experience,	Thanks
0,Our bathroom (the only one in our home) is to be remodeled, starting 03/30/15.  The Hansgrohe Sink Push Open Drain was the last of many "trim" parts to install, we purchased for the contractor who's doing the work.  We bought all Hansgrohe parts: faucets, manifolds, shower wand, etc.  The Push Open Drain is beautifully made; the machining precise, with a solid "click" you can feel when you close and open the drain stopper.  Its quality is fantastic, which is why we paid the prices for all Hansgrohe in our bathroom.  If you appreciate solid, heavy, metal parts with outstanding design and attention to detail, this company provides it, and it's what we wanted to live with on a daily, ongoing basis.  Just go down to Home Depot and pick up the "name brand" plumbing trim (that's what the contractors refer to when talking about the faucets and other plumbing hardware in bathrooms), then pick up something made by Hansgrohe; you will see the difference and understand why their products cost more.  They make what American plumbing companies used to make 50 years ago, but no longer today.
0,Supreme quality,
0,Fits a Mora 2000 like a glove, snap and sheath. The sheath is some mystery leather and is a decent thickness for a sheath. Stitched and riveted edge. Snap is removable and adjustable for different handles.		The sheath was received bone dry, possibly from how it is stored or how it is made. You really need to oil it up to hydrate the leather to make it supple enough before use and abuse. I tossed a coat of mink oil on it that I also use on my leather boots and it soaked it right up and holds up fine to regular use.		A simple, cheap, quality sheath. The rivets seems to pinch the leather enough to keep the blade away from the stitching. For the price of a happy meal you too can take a chance on this great sheath working for your knife.
0,As per other reviews, the removal of ballast and rewiring for the installation was very simple.  No lumen rating on the product description (just an estimate of 90-120 lumens per watt) and I wanted to make sure I got the brightest bulb so I opted for the 28w version.  Lights do seem brighter than the fluorescent tubes they replaced (which were 2900 lumens each).  Hope that can give you an idea if they will be bright enough for you.  I bought two for my fixture.  I am docking one star because one bulb is instant on and the second bulb in the same fixture takes 1-2 seconds longer to turn on.  It is kind of annoying.
0,One of my favorite knives.  I own  3 now. It's very sharp abd fits nicely in my hand.
0,I searched long and far for this quality and style of doorbell button to replace the CHEAP plastic one installed at my front door by the home builder. Hopefully, they can eventually incorporate an LED lamp and reduce the back-hole depth requirement, because I had to drill a larger hole in the brick wall  (ugh) to make it fit.
0,By far the best flashlight I've ever seen.  It has a large central spot, and a VERY large, VERY bright flood light area [at the same time]. If you're walking outside or looking for something in the dark, this is the light to get.
0,I hope this review helps someone else know when its time to change their soldering tip.		In short, this tip works wonderfully in my Weller iron.		The longer story is that I'm relatively new to soldering and am certainly still learning. Recently I was having the worst time soldering items.  I need to solder some wires to a connector, but I was having trouble getting solder to melt.  Sometimes it would take 30 seconds of heat to melt the solder, sometimes it wouldn't melt at all.  I tried everything I could think of (turns out most of these are unwise): changing the temperature, changing the solder, applying pressure to somehow 'force' the solder to melt.  Eventually it got to the point where no solder would melt at all or it would sometimes appear to vaporize as opposed to melt.  If I did get it to melt it would just fall off the tip and not stick where I needed it to.		I couldn't find anywhere online that said when you should change your soldering tip, just that sometimes people would suggest that people with my same issues needed a new tip.  So I got a new tip.		As soon as I looked at the new tip I knew this was my problem (Attached image of old and new tip to review).  My old tip was completely discolored due to misuse such as not keeping solder on the tip, having the temperature too high, and not keeping it clean.  I believe this discoloring is from oxidization and apparently this makes a barrier that keeps the solder from melting properly.  Usually you can use&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Solder-Tip-Cleaning-Wire/dp/B00FZPGDLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Solder Tip Cleaning Wire</a>&nbsp;or a sponge to remove this, but mine was let go for far too long and the tip was ruined.		As soon as I attached this new tip, it was like night and day.  The solder melted to the tip very quickly and it has allowed me to regain my soldering sanity.  The rest of my project was hundreds of times easier with a working tip.		I'll be taking much better care of this tip.
0,The main center light is like the landing light on a 747...in other words, it's as bright as you would ever need for just about every purpose. The set up is comfortable to wear and easy to use. It may be more than most need in a headlamp, but will certainly cover all activities needing a hands-free light source.
0,I bought this strictly for rebuilding axles. Works great for checking pinion pre-load and carrier pre-load.  Has a nice plastic blown case and fitted foam pad.
0,Needs finer control of the water jet. If you're not careful your bum will feel like it's been stabbed with an ice pick.
0,Great sound good price
0,I bought this for sole use and storage in my 5th wheel RV. It fits perfectly in my forward storage compartment and is great to have in camp for multiple uses. I used it this year to blow-out and clean my bug zapper, clean off some of my fishing supplies, canning supplies, and I even helped other RV'ers with getting their tires up to pressure before they left camp. This is a very useful item to say the least and it takes-up very little storage space!
0,Very worth the price.
0,Looks Good Feels good, nice finish
0,Fits the spark plug. There is a boot inside. You have to push to get plug to sit inside socket. Or just take boot out. It showed but I don't have rite size ratchet. So I just order one from same company along with extension. Showed in 4 days to state of Illinois.
0,Work well over my glasses to keep my eyes from getting itchy, red and swollen from dust when I mow. They provide a tighter fit than the (non-OTG) DeWalt model does.
0,great product quick ship
0,Nice little blue night light. In my opinion it's not very bright but bright enough to not wake anybody up and enough to see where your going at night. I like the hustle blue on this nightlight, the only thing is that you have to pull it out of the wall socket n order to turn it off.
0,I ordered these supplemental parts for my shop vac. The pieces are durable high impact plastic. I use them in conjunction with the long strait tubes and a curved top to clean my gutters. Works well.
0,Solves a recurring problem of bright LED's on almost every type of electronic products.	Some of my items had brightness levels above that of a night light.		Great price, great assortment, and they really work.
0,I've been waiting for an LED bulb that would be able to replace the PAR20 bulbs of my recessed ceiling lights for some time. The bulbs these replace are 50w halogen bulbs that put out 525 lumens. At just 9 watts, the Feit bulbs put out a comparable amount of light - it even seems they are a little brighter, in some ways (though these say they're rated at 450 lumens). The light seems just a bit "cooler" but not enough to be unnatural or bothersome. Either way, at just 9w these are far more efficient and over the long run, hopefully more reliable as well. They are pretty expensive (3x-4x as much as halogen) but considering I was replacing my halogen bulbs as often as every 6 months, and these are supposed to last 10x-12x as long, they should easily pay themselves just in replacement costs alone.
0,UPDATE 7/2/17	Still using this set up daily and no issues. We would recommend it.		Easy install, This is very easy to use!	The bronze color is rich and looks great installed!		UPDATE	11/5/15	We have  been using our shower for many months now. We love it, very easy to regulate the water temperature. Easy to clean. It still looks like brand new! You can take the middle piece out of the shower head that's hand held. There are five different options on how you'd like the water to leave the head, that's controlled by a little lever on the right side of the head, love it!
0,Excellent performance on my field exercises.
0,Love it. Lights up automatically during dusk. Then lights up lighter when you walk by it or an animal walks underneath it.
0,Plenty of light and fit fine into our lamps. Will buy more.
0,Fit perfeclty.
0,Worked exactly as we wanted it to perform.
0,Very pleased with the quality of this tool.  It's well built and saved the day on a project that had me at a standstill.
0,While remodeling my bathroom, I decided the old light fixture needed to be replaced. I purchased the Nuvo SF77/195 Eight Light Vanity Strip as a replacement for over the double sink and wall to wall mirror. It was easy to install and really brightens up the bathroom. It's made well and comes at a reasonable price.
0,Works great on small sinks without a plunger-knob for the drain.
0,This extension cord is heavy, well-insulated, and seems to built for long and trouble-free use. The light in the plug shows that it's connected. This will save you a walk to see if it's OK.
0,Fantastic design and construction. Easy install and looks solid and well sealed. Provides plenty of light for stairwells and walkways outside. The 3 D sells should last a long time.
0,I placed mine in the bathroom, hanging off a wicker shelf unit, just about mid-thigh level.  It's perfect for those late night trips to the bathroom; it lights up right away then shuts off after about 30 seconds.  It turns back on once movement is sensored.  It's relatively bright, but not blinding, like turning on the light switch shock.  Like Mr. Beams, this one doesn't like rechargable batteries.
0,Very bright, crisp white, not warm. Really light my room up. Note: these are not dimmer compatible but for a lamp or similar, they work great..
0,Never thought simple spade bits could be this great.
0,Great item, great price, great quality.	Fantastic for every day carry!
0,What a pleasant tool to use, easy to maneuver in tight areas!
0,These lights are kind of expensive, but when they arrived they were larger and nicer than I expected (about 3 inches in diameter, see photos).  They are large enough that I considered using them to replace my PAR38 halogen outdoor spotlights, although I decided against the hassle of figuring out how to remove the wiring of the old setup.  These solar lights include mounting hardware as well as spikes, so installing them is a breeze whether on a wall or in the ground.		The light is the beautiful soft blue that I love; it is clear and crisp though perhaps not as illuminating at a distance as a yellower light.  The fact that the lights are not motion sensitive is another consideration against them as spotlights.  However, besides the starlight glow, what I love most about the lights is how hassle free they are.  They turn on without fail whenever it is dark and require no wiring or exterior power supply except for the sun.  They are IP65 waterproof, which means they can handle water jets and sprinklers from any angle.  They are large and powerful but harmless and lightweight; a child could install these instead of an electrician.		All in all, these lights represent the latest and greatest in lighting technology which I expect to become more widespread.  Would I pay $99.99 for them?  No, but for the list price of $29.99 I would feel that I got my money's worth.  This is a fine product that is remarkably convenient and easy to use.		Disclaimer: I received a discount on this product for evaluation purposes.
0,Great!
0,very tiny, and surprising light. I buy these when I need to qualify for free ship, put em on zippers of your outdoor gear, key chain, packpack whatever. I have several streamlights and have not been kind to them all, heh, penlight survived laundry 2x.. batts don't have super long life and are those stupid watch batts. Twist on, had one on 24hrs in my pocket bummer, the one on my wifes keychain fell apart, apparently twist on kept twisting til it unthreaded.... hey they are nifty filler like the spyderco Slipit knifes

0,Very very good
0,While more than I'd want to pay, I absolutely love these!  No CFC fluorescents and hazards, instant on-no warmup.....great  lighting that generates virtually no heat..
0,love it fit great ,looks great
0,It works and arrived quickly.
0,I am a DIY and works on smaller repair jobs at home. I bought this tool to repair the bottom edge of exterior stucco wall. I needed to fill some gaps between the stucco and the wall behind the stucco. This is the right tool than a painter's knife, as it made it much easier to do a good job. It is a quality tool; it is solid and well balanced and the metal has a nice bell sound when you hit it. Even though it is not stainless steel, I clean it with water and dry it after each use. I have used the tool several times and have not seen any rust yet.
0,Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++
0,Great drill
0,I don't know why I didn't order this sooner.  It fits over my lower cabinet door and holds more than 30 plastic bags.  It freed up so much cabinet space!  Great product.
0,Loses wifi connection from time to time, otherwise great breaker bar. 10 out of 10..
0,Nice
0,Perfect.
0,Looks great
0,I bought this to make sure my garage door gets closed. It works as intended. I think this is lacking a part to space it and secure it on the store more properly. Just my opinion.
0,GLW 10w 12v Ac or Dc Led Flood Light	The light is in a small enclosure that gives you a large amount of mounting choices.	The light produces a good spot of bright light.	It is a great work light.	I have received a discounted purchase price to evaluate this product.
0,It makes taking those drivelines out a bit easier.
0,These work very well.
0,These SOG Flash II knives are my absolute favorite every day carry tool.  The assisted opening is very convenient when using one hand to take the knife out for use.  Great knife!
0,This faucet reserves a certain amount of space for itself. It is not one to sit on the sink, rather; it is bold enough that it will catch your gaze when you walk into the bathroom every time. This is what I mean by 'Strong Personality'. Almost as robust as a kitchen faucet, this standard size faucet by Moen is a large sized hand stuffed in a small sized glove.		Here is what you need for the install:		1. Channel Locks	2. Adjustable End Wrench	3. Safety Glasses	4. Plumbing Adhesive/Sealant	5. Plumbing Tape	**Not mentioned in the guide** (Optional, but Helpful):	6. A bucket (for excess drainage)	7. Rags/Towels	8. A work light	9. 12mm box wrench		**Install**		If you have not installed a bathroom faucet before this may seem like something you may be able to handle on your own. You can, so let's get that out of the way. The installation is very straightforward. There is more unscrewing, and cleaning than anything. However, the instruction manual is very limited and somewhat hard to understand. You get 1 sheet that has around 16 steps for the install only, not removal of old faucet. There is no wording describing in detail what the picture is doing. You will have to guess for yourself, and there will be some of that if you have no experience. What is confusing is the A & B differentiation. Around step 5, the instructions branch off to a '5a' and a '5b'. All of the A's are on the front side, and all of the B's are on the back. At first I thought that I was going to have to do all of the steps, but found out after I had finished installing that there were about 10 steps that I would not have to do. These leftover steps were the B's. Basically, you will have to judge from your piping, and the pictures in the instruction manual, whether or not you should do certain steps or not. Maybe the 'B' side is for another model of faucet? As you can see, they are not described at all. Moreover, the parts that come with the faucet only seem to be for the 'A' side.		That is really the only negative I have with this. I did not need the install guide, except for what parts to coat with sealant, and plumbing tape. The only part that is not straightforward is the stopper setup. I will just say, follow the directions by the pictures and you will be fine.		Also they did not describe how to install the Hot/Cold rings. The handle covers (not the handles that turn) will unscrew up a little bit so that you can work the rings underneath and then tighten them back down. Frankly, the rings take away from the polished subtleness of this faucet. They stand out in a bad way.		The handles are 1/4 turn, so they are easy to turn on and off without twisting needlessly. They also turn with much smoothness.		When I received the faucet, the spout was a little loose. This can be fixed by tightening 2 phillips-head screws on the underside of the assembly. I suggest doing this before you install it. Made the spout very tight and rigid.		There are many positive things about replacing your old faucet: 1. You get to do some hands-on work that is not too difficult and can be a good project for a weekend afternoon.  2. You replace a constituent part of your everyday life so that you have an inexpensive way of adding quality to your place of residence. All of this added to the quality and aesthetics of a Moen. Has my recommendation.
0,Top quality--puts the cheap versions to shame.
0,This product works well and I appreciate the reasonable price.
0,This is great for crafts!
0,Incredibly easy to put together, seems well made
0,Works great. compact
0,Wonderful. Love this lamp. Looks great on the desk, works perfectly well. Recommended.
0,I really like these!
0,These are super cute for our son's room.		They're easy to stick, they stick well (without being permanent) and they don't have much of a border (and what they do have is clear), so it looks much nicer than the old wall decals that were around 10+ years ago, which just looked like cheap stickers on your wall. These are artistic, and look nice, and they spruce up a room's decor.		They're also easy to remove from the wall, without taking any paint with them. They don't stick quite as well once you peel them off, but if you reposition them once or twice before settling on a location, they seem to stick just fine.
0,Excellent Product
0,The best in its class! I really recomend it.
0,Freaking Awesome! why didn't I learn about this stuff sooner? Would have saved me a ton of money on drill bits.
0,perfect for my daughter's science project. I still have more extra bulbs that I keep for future use.
0,perfect
0,I used this on quad shield RG6 (Coleman cable brand) with the PPC Ex6xlPlus compression connectors and everything worked great. I'm glad I bought this instead of using my old non-rg6 wire stripper. The cut is perfect every time.
0,[Update 2: August 2016]		In Feb 2016 I ran another side by side comparison of the Corentium 223 vs the SS (Safety Siren), and this time using two charcoal tests as "controls."  All four were placed around the same spot (pictures do not show the charcoal tests but they were right next to the Corentium and SS).  The Corentium and the SS were turned on at the same time and allowed to run until the SS started to show a result (due to the SS not showing an initial reading until a couple days after turning it on or resetting it, whereas the Corentium starts showing a reading almost immediately).		Once the Corentium and SS were on for a few days I opened both charcoal tests and left them open for 4 days (the longest time allowed by the lab to get legitimate/accurate results).  Then I sealed up the charcoal tests and mailed them in and checked the readings of the Corentium and the SS which had now been on for 7-days (the reason for 7 days is that the devices both provide readings at 7 days but other readings are at different time parameters and so not comparable).  The results are shown in my pics (3rd-6th pics).		Charcoal Test #1: <0.5 pCi/L	Charcoal Test #2: <0.6 pCi/L	Corentium 223: 0.97 pCi/L ("7 days" reading)	Safety Siren: 1.2 pCi/L ("S"=7 days reading)		Please note that I bought both the Corentium and the SS in March 2014 and so both were almost 2 years old at this point.  I'm not sure the charcoal test results and those of the Corentium and the SS can be compared directly since their readings are over different times (approximate 4 days for the charcoal test vs 7 days for the two devices; I had to do this since the charcoal tests cannot be tested for more then 4 days and the two devices do not show readings at shorter times (e.g. 3 days, etc.).		Interpreting the results is not exactly easy or maybe even valid, but it does at least seem to show that the devices are not wildly different than the charcoal readings and more importantly, they seem to read higher rather than lower than the charcoal readings (i.e. they do not give falsely low readings).  It also shows that the charcoal tests are very close to each other and therefore probably a reliable test (i.e. repeated testing yields values close in value to each other) and are assumed to be the most accurate way to test radon levels.  Another finding is that the SS, which needs re-calibration annually, had higher values compared with the Corentium (which is not supposed to need retitration over the life of the device which is stated as about 10 years).  However, when I left the two devices on for a few more days (see the 6th pic) I found that the values became much closer to each other: 0.9 for the SS and 0.94 for the Corentium.		Conclusions?  I would say that based on my amateur and non-expert tests and interpretation of the results, that both devices are probably reliable and accurate enough to get a decent approximation of the radon levels in your home.  The SS, though cheaper than the Corentium, is uglier and needs a wall power adapter whereas the Corentium is smaller, better looking, lasts a long time on batteries, and can be hung on the wall.  It also reportedly does not need re-calibration for the 10 year lifespan and so I consider the Corentium to be a superior device and would recommend it over the Safety Siren.		[Update 1: March 2015]		Sorry to the folks who were waiting to see the results of my side by side comparisons between this device, the Safety Siren, and the charcoal mail in tests.  I've attached a photo of both detectors (along with the charcoal test, only did one of those) side by side after both had been sitting there for over a week.  As you can see, the Safety Siren is set to short term reading, which I believe is the past 7 days reading, and shows at 1.6 while the Corentium shows 1.64 and is for the past 7 days also.  So, based on this test (and I've done this several other times with the same, comparable results) both detectors seem to give similar readings.		Of course, the gold standard seems to still be the charcoal, mail in kits and so I've attached a photo of that reading too.  Basically, the kit shown in the pick was set out for the required time (48 hours) and mailed in promptly.  The reading I got back from the company was 1.7 pCi/L, so pretty close to both detectors.  The Safety Siren only goes to one decimal place and so is a bit more limited than the Corentium which goes out to 2 decimal places, but in reality 2 decimal places is probably not very valuable or helpful.		So, to summarize, my test did show that the device is pretty accurate compared to a charcoal test and also that the Safety Siren was comparable -- although that device does not run on batteries and apparently needs to be recalibrated on an annual basis or so.  The Corentium supposedly does not ever need to be recalibrated which just seems really odd to me.  I will repeat these tests periodically and update this review on an annual basis (or until a better detector comes out than either of these!) to see how well the Corentium stands up over the years with regards to calibration need.  I have also upgraded my rating to 4-stars.		---		[Original Review: April 2014]		Just want to point out that this radon detector does not wait for a couple days to give an initial radon reading, like some detectors do (like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Safety-Siren-Pro-Series3-Radon-Gas-Detector-HS71512-by-Family-Safety-Products-Inc/dp/B000CEAY64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Safety Siren Pro Series3 Radon Gas Detector - HS71512 by Family Safety Products, Inc.</a>&nbsp;does), so basically within a minute or so of turning this device on for the first time (or after resetting), you will start to get initial readings that are predictably around 0.00 pCi/L.  Obviously, getting a reading after 10 seconds isn't helpful, and I don't understand why it would give a worthless reading instead of making you wait for the necessary time (typically 2 days with the Safety Siren Pro detector) before giving you a reading.		Over the next days/weeks, the reading will often steadily increase for the same reason, making you really question how useful this device is unless you wait at least a week or so.  Even then, you're not sure if the 7-day reading is a weighted average -- meaning that those early really low readings would bring the average rating lower than it actually is.  When I placed the Safety Siren Pro and the Corentium side by side for about 2 days in my basement near my sump pit, the readings were dramatically different: the Safety Siren gave a 1.7 and the Corentium around 0.56.  Over the next couple days (again, the initial readings were after 2 days already), the Corentium reading starting to creep upwards, going from mid-0.5s to around 1.0 and then above, while the Safety Siren Pro stayed fairly steady around 1.7  Another couple days may bring the Corentium to around the reading of the Safety Siren Pro, which would make me feel better that they're both reliable if given enough time.		I have ordered some charcoal testing kits (which get sent and read by a lab) to use as a kind of reference testing (supposed to be the best way to test apparently) to see which, if either or both, is accurate in detecting radon levels.  I will update this review when it does come back, but preliminary testing with the Corentium leaves me unimpressed, especially for the hefty price tag.
0,Once installed, it worked well. When I changed over from CFLs to LEDs, I had to reset the receiver, which was easy if you follow the directions. The only thing I do not like about the control, is that the dimmer does not have a maximum or minimum recall function. You have to hold the button until you think the lights are up or down all the way. I also like that there is still enough room under the remote mount to access the switch if the battery does die.
0,Arrived undamaged and is a perfect fit and match. Really extended the lathe spindle capacity.
0,It looks like it takes a really thin layer of grout off, but nothing material.  I didn't have to scrub, and I had fantastically white grout when I was done.  Outside of a current newspaper, solid flush, a vent and some soft toilet paper, what else can I ask for in my bathroom???
0,This is a suprising little device. I received the package and it contained a lot of parts I wasn't expecting. What I discovered is that the flashlight comes with a rechargeable battery, a holder, and a charger. Three tripple A batteries can also be used. At time of writing, I am using the regular batteries. First, there are no instructions, so you need to go on intuition to figure this out. Not hard at all, but perplexing at first with all the extra pieces. No trouble getting the batteries in. Once together, the operation is pretty easy...push in for a wide beam, pull out for a more focused one. This thing is bright! I powered it on around one in the afternoon and it still lit up the room nicely. The design is pretty solid and has some heft to it without being cumbersome at all. One of those extra pieces that threw me off at first was a keychain flashlight It's powered by three button batteries and you have to pull a plastic piece out to engage the power. It's pretty powerful, too. I did notice a flicker here and there, but it's a tiny casing with a plunger trigger at the back of the housing, so my experience with these is that it's a common issue. I've been using it for the past hour or so, and it has performed nicely, helping me put together another item I had ordered. The main flashlight is small enough to fit in a pocket, and the settings for the beam are clearly marked on the housing. This is definitely a friend to have in the woods or if you're working in a basement. It's a bright white light, so it won't distort any wire colors.
0,I bought this for our kitchen sink. I love the all-in-one feature. The spout pulls out and can switch from spray to single stream with the touch of a button. However, this particular model seems to be constructed out of plastic. It has a lightweight, cheap feel to it. So far, it works perfectly and I'm glad to have it, but I wish it had some heft to it.
0,Beautiful & functional! Not sure what else you can say. Except I wish they had it in black for my other bathroom.
0,very bright, but not as hot as the regular bulbs
0,Love these brushes.  Various sizes, so you always have the right one.  Just cleaned a filter for the hydraulic pump driving the top of an SL500.  Very happy I had these.
0,This is the greatest little tool to add to your key chain!  No more ripped bags with chips flying all over the car, just release the small scissors and cut across bag, your good to go!  Small knife AIDS in opening mail envelopes and when your nail needs a quick file its there as well as tweezers and a handy tooth pick. You won't want to be without this beautiful tool.  I've received compliments on mine and probably sold more!
0,This lamp is amazing
0,Probably not doing it justice by saying that its amazing.  If you are into DIY projects, get this.
0,just as described
0,Wow.  Half the price of the fluke snips and just as sharp.  Maybe a rougher cut but like I said, half the price of the Flukes.
0,these megadora screwdrivers have the best tips, ever!  the two plastics in the handle aren't quite as different feeling as I think they should be but my hand doesn't slip on them and the tips certainly don't slip on a phillips screw-head.		and the knurling on the shaft is great to two-hand spin screws in until the head is seated.
0,outstanding
0,knob with shine
0,Much brighter than the 60W incandescent lights it replaced. Very white light.
0,Thank you.
0,Just what I've come to expect in terms of quality. A brand you can trust.
0,I bought one and was amazed at how bright it was for such a small device(lights an entire room).  Went and bought a second.  Super long run time on 3 D-size batteries(up to 75 hours on high setting stated on package).  Will come in handy here in FL during hurricane season when the power goes out.  The batteries are not hard to change as some have stated. The blinking find light is so dull that its almost unnoticeable so I doubt it drains battery power as some have asserted.
0,Great bulbs.
0,These has worked perfectly. Bought our first  two 4 years ago and have since bought two more - not because the first 2 have stopped working - they are still going strong. Just wanted some in other areas like the garage in case we had to evacuate the house in the night as we live amongst pine trees.
0,my 1990 Sears opener died... replaced it with this model .. simple to install, wire, and program	lock, light, simple...youtube videos to help
0,I am not a contrator or builder, I'm an IT manager. So why the hell do I need this housewrecker on my desk? Because it pleases me. Its very presence seems to reduce the number of questions people ask me that they could have figured out on their own.		Also, when hard-drive disposal time comes around, this works quite well at ensuring that not only are all data security policies complied with, but I've taken out a lot of frustrations. Wear eye protection, please!
0,Bought this saw >20 years ago.  Choose Grizzly because of product support and maybe better fit and finish than most imports.  These are a copy of Dayton brand from WWGrainger that cost 8-10 times more. Had to tune a bit when new to get it to cut accurate and not throw blades. After initial setup it has required little maintenance. Made a lower shelf/base with bigger wheels to make it easier to move and more rigid. Use this saw to support repair and fabrication on the farm.  Thousands of cuts through a wide range of materials. Use bi-metal 10-14tpi blades at medium speed which give gives good blade life through a wide variety of material sizes. A drop of cutting oil on hard materials or stainless. Overall very satisfied and definitely got my moneys worth.  Sometimes could use a bigger one but the portability and small footprint in the shop would suffer. Reliable and should last for many years to come. Would buy again.
0,My husband liked this
1,The concept behind these pipe clamps is great, but I had exactly the same problem that Dana Vogel did (we're not related). Specifically, the clutch plates on the fixed side were installed upside down so that the long tabs point down. As a result, the clamp cannot lay flat, which completely defeats the entire purpose of these clamps. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of obvious mistake, and a company with a reputation like Irwin should never, ever have allowed this to happen. The fact that another person here experienced the same problem leads me to believe that Irwin has enormous quality control problems. I will definitely be returning these. I plan to replace them with the similar ones recently released by Rockler even though the Rocker clamps require a threaded pipe.
1,The other reviews here have been way to kind on this product.		These are awful. No copper to be found inside and they were cast around a metal tube. I would definitely not trust these to heat or conduct like standard Hakko tips.		I occasionally need to cut through plastic and hate using my regular tips for that. I will use these instead.
1,My wife bought one of these new years ago, and I just finished trying to use it for like maybe the 3rd time.  Now I remember why I don't use it; this is one of those low end products that piles on features, but is still crap.  Yep, has a dustbag, that's great. Comes in an attractive carry case, awesome. Lets talk about actually sanding with it - with a lot of fuss I can manage to sand for about 5 to 10 seconds without the paper coming off if I'm lucky.  Then I have to stop and reseat the paper, mess with the little wire holder things again, and start over.  I just tried sanding some exposed door jamb, so what maybe 3/4 inch max by about 15 linear feet ? What should have been a super easy job was made a pain in the rump by this thing.  I am going to sell it, and save for a proper sander.  This was a waste of money; I could almost sand by hand as quickly.
1,I bought the Ariel Bath TB222M dual-flush toilet in late 2015 during a remodel of our main bathroom. The product arrived well-packaged, well-protected and in perfect condition. We loved the one-piece design, the low profile, and the potential that the dual-flush feature would save on water.		It is now March 14, 2017, and I have to tell you we absolutely hate this toilet. It appeared to work fine for about one year, then problems began to happen. We have noticed that it is difficult to keep clean. Though our water pressure is more than adequate, the water flow design is not sufficient and requires cleaning abnormally often. If you do not clean this toilet about once each two or three days a mildew begins to build up on the underside of the rim. I have not experienced anything like it, we did not have this problem with the toilet it replaced, and we don't see this problem in our second bathroom toilet which is a different brand/model.		The most annoying flaw is also the problem that is going to force us to replace this one-year-old toilet... water leakage. It makes this continual "dripping" sound, which after another plumber visit, we learned is the silicone seal on the cistern. Where standard toilets have a "flapper" that is popped open to flush the toilet, this toilet has a vertical valve with a silicone seal that rides up and down on a plastic disc. That silicone seal doesn't seal very firmly, and causes drops of water to leak from the tank down into the bowl. No water leaves the toilet, mind you, but the dripping from the tank to the bowl is loud and resonant.		We twice reached out the the manufacturer, Ariel Bath, and received no response. A phone message left on their automated system was never returned. The paperwork that came with the toilet does not indicate replacement part numbers and we have no idea where to find a replacement cistern seal. We took the seal to our local Lowes and they have nothing that will fit it. I took a trip to our local plumbing specialist supplier, and they could find no matching replacement. Without a way to get parts, and no one at the manufacturer who will return our call or messages, and no additional information on their web site... we are basically stuck.		I absolutely do not recommend this product, you will be left in the cold if anything should need replacement. Even our plumbers are mystified. This was an expensive lesson for us. The product began giving us problems just a little over one year after professional installation.
1,The product seemed like it was sitting on the shelf for years. the paint on the keying portion of the locks seemed like they're peeling off.	The installation was a breeze.
1,Ordered the Dado Throat Plate. Received a standard plate instead (but marked as the dado model in the bag). It didn't include the release knob and instead had a set screw like the 4 other leveling ones. Also, there was no finger hold to facilitate removals.
1,Needed to refinish a small slab of Carrara marble, a relatively soft stone. I bought these pads after reading all the reviews and thinking I wanted to splurge for a decent set of diamond polishing pads instead of the harbor freight polishing pads I had used previously with my angle grinder on edges only.  This wax for the full surface, so I even bought a new polisher and made sure to keep the RPMs within the stated range. I tried it slower I tried it faster with water, then dry, and I even went back and started over going from 200 grit up again,  thinking maybe I had done something wrong, but none of my attempts gave me a factory finish!  It's  slightly shiny at best.  I reverted to my non-diamond pads (only go up to 600 grit btw) and angle grinder and that worked even better than these at the finest grits!  So I  laid out more money and bought some marble polishing compound which I'm expecting tomorrow.  I hope it works to give me a factory finish. After  spending  five hours of working with these pads yesterday, I'm really disappointed.
1,These look even brighter than the rated 200 lumins.  They were automatically turned on at dusk on low and at 4am were stil going strong.  I have them positioned to highlight my colored foliage in my backyard.  From previous experience over more than a year, I recommend this company for quality and customer service issues.		I am not going to savage this company because anyone is entitled to have one bad unit.  I have 6 of UR Power Changing Color Solar Lighs.  They do arrive uncharged.  My last order from CoCo included the usual 2 units, one was doa.  I left it in the sum for 2 days to no effect than sent it back to Amazon.  What I will gripe about is they tell you that you may need to change the battery in a year and a half.  The lithium battery they use is flat topped on both ends, unlike any of the other 4 companie's batteries.  So far I have not seen a replacement on amazon.  Their "proprietary" battery will charge in any chager so I did that and it luckily brought new life.  Again, the Lithium Ion batteries Amazon sells will not work in this UR Solar unit.  The included folder does not tell you where to obtain the proper battery.  That is a mistake in my opinion and until they make it easy they will lose business to their chief competitor which I would imagine is the wonderful company Innogear.  I am not going to go on a hunt myself.  I don't care to spend my time doing what could be eliminated if more thought had gone into the brochure.  Maybe with this complaint it will.
1,to small cheap looking!
1,Two of these burned out really quickly and they are supposed to last a really long time.  Very disappointed!  I think bulbs this expensive should last more than a few weeks.
1,There are only 3 square magnets in the middle.  A lot of times they don't catch each other, leaving large gaps in the screen where insects can get in.  I forgot which one I got before, but another brand offered magnets all the way down the middle.  That design ensures that the screen closes properly.		Too bad I didn't open and install this screen when I first got it or else I would've returned it.
1,I'm so disappointed.  I've used this very same model at my sisters house. It was awesome. Mine hardly sprays on high. I could not even put hers to high yet.  I wanted this so bad.
1,I took a chance on ordering this, but the price is too good to be true.  The rack was a full inch wider than it was supposed to be, so it would not fit in my oven.  Other websites list this rack as 21 7/8 inches wide.  This seller lists it as 22 inches wide, but the one I got was actually 22 7/8 inches wide.  It also appeared to be used, with crusty, black, burned-on stains, and overall discoloration of the chrome.  And I'm really upset about having to pay for return shipping when the seller is at fault.  Buyer beware!
1,At this price point (less than 10 bucks) one should not expect an industrial strength professional tool. Usually fails to cut the wire. Even for occasional amateur use I would advise going up in price to get some more quality. Directions for use include: "Various producta [sic] make ..." ; "Speciacly [sic] -made tool" ; "ensures durabicity [sic]". Many people/factories do not have English as a native language, but on-line spell checkers are really easy these days. This sloppiness really makes you wonder about the attention and quality control of the supplier.
1,Some of the poor reviews are correct - I also got one that binds and seizes up. After taking it apart, I discovered why - the inner sprocket and chain pulley are both drilled off-center by at least 10mm (3/8")! This results in rubbing between the chain and the cover. Another problem was that one of the plates were bent, which pulled the cover even closer to the chain pulley and thus increased the chance of contact. I definitely got what I paid for, which was very little. I'll put it to work in the next few weeks and see if I get frustrated enough to throw it into the scrap metal pile or not.
1,Here is what Consumer Reports says about this type of fire extinguisher:	With their low prices and ease of use, aerosol fire sprays are a tempting purchase. But the sprays are no substitute for a fire extinguisher. In fact, in Consumer Reports' tests the sprays sometimes made a grease fire flare up, which could make it spread. Performance problems caused us to judge two aerosol fire spraysthe First Alert AF400 Tundra Fire Extinguishing Spray and Shield Fire Protection Kitchen GuardDon't Buy: Performance Problem. Now we've found a third brand being advertised called Knockout 360 that's also an aerosol fire spray.		None of the sprays has a pressure indicator that shows whether the unit is ready for use. Although their labels state that they are not intended to replace a standard National Fire Protection Association compliant fire extinguisher (NFPA 10), that statement can be easily overlooked. The sprays have a relatively short shelf life of three years as opposed to six to 12 for dry chemical units. We recommend that you pass on the Knockout 360 and any other fire fighting spray that lacks these key features and buy a conventional fire extinguisher with a gauge that meets NFPA 10 requirements.
1,The Mag-Lite Solitaire is well designed and well made but simply isn't bright enough.  However, if all you use a flashlight for is looking for your keys under the seat of your car or assisting with reading menus, it may be OK.  It has a sleek design, and it's appeareance won't draw attention on a keychain.  It functions like any other (large) mini mag light, by twisting the end where the light comes out to turn it on and off.  Change the battery by unscrewing the other end.  A spare bulb is concealed within the end cap.		Pros:		-It's small.		-it's well made, with all components fitting together smoothly, and a clean simple appearence.		Cons:		-it's just not that bright.  Some of the newer LED flashlights are of a similar size but much brighter.		Overall, I'd have to give this one a pass, unless I developed a fetish for small, well designed gadgets (like watches, watches are SOOO cool! and miniature sextents, those things are SOOO neat!).  OK, so I have this fetish, and this would explain why I have a Solitaire in my toolbox.
1,Would not light up just now when tested. Says battery in / has on off switch, so going to try a new solar battery / will change to 5 stars IF it works
1,PUT A FRESH BATTERY IN AND IT WORKED OK.WASN'T AS BRIGHT AS I EXPECTED , BUT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY WAY TO COMPARE IT . AFTER A MINUTE OR SO ,I TURNED IT OFF.TRIED IT ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATER AND IT WAS DEAD.FLICKED THE SWITCH A DOZEN TIMES AND NOTHING.TOOK THE BATTERY OUT AND REINSERTED.NOTHING.TAPPED IT IN MY HAND A FEW TIMES .NOTHING.TRIED AGAIN LATER AND IT WORKED AGAIN.USED IT A COUPLE MINUTES ,FIGURED IT WAS OK .THEN SHUT IT OFF.TRIED AGAIN AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES.DEAD.FLICKED THE SWITCH OVER AND OVER.NOTHING.PUT IN ANOTHER FRESH BATTERY.NOTHING .TRIED BOTH BATTERIES IN MY OTHER CREE LIGHT I JUST GOT AND IT WORKED FINE. PUT A BATTERY BACK IN IT. NOTHING. WAITED AWHILE AND THEN IT WORKED AGAIN.KEPT IT ON AND HEADED TO THE BASEMENT TO TRY IT IN A DARKER AREA.WHILE I WAS WALKING AROUND WITH IT , AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES OR SO ,IT JUST SHUT OFF ON IT'S OWN. WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON.NOTIFIED AMAZON THAT I INTEND TO RETURN IT. ALL OF THAT OCCURRED THIS MORNING JUST AFTER IT WAS DELIVERED. AROUND 11 PM, I PUT A BATTERY BACK IN TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. IT IS WORKING AGAIN! NOW THAT IT IS DARK OUT ,IT DOES SEEM BRIGHT ENOUGH.I WALKED ALL AROUND THE HOUSE WITH IT AND IT SEEMED FINE .TURNED IT OFF AND ON SEVERAL TIMES IN SHORT SUCCESSION AND IT TURNED ON OK.SHUT IT OFF AND LET IT SIT FOR 10 MINUTES AND IT IS DEAD AGAIN.KEEP FLICKING THE SWITCH BUT IT WON'T TURN ON. DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE WRONG,BUT IT IS NOT RELIABLE. ALL OF THESE BLACK LIGHTS SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS, SO I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL BOTHER GETTING ANOTHER ONE.
1,The red ink faded into yellow in less than a month. Now after about 2.5 months the formerly black ink is grey, while the former red is getting close to total fade out. Unacceptable!
1,Useless piece of doo, doo !
1,Buy parts from your local hardware store before buying from this vendor. The product was OK but it was for a different faucet type. Too many public school graduates working for the place, I guess.
1,The original bulb for my Ott Lite lasted 7-10 years. I use the lamp in the same place, in the same way, always. This replacement bulb lasted exactly one year. I have bought it again because I love the lamp but if I don't see significant improvement with this bulb I will can the entire lamp and find something that takes a cheaper bulb.
1,Just quit working motor blew after just 14 months installation. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HUNTER QUALITY!!!
1,Looked gorgeous initially. Within 2 months, the various colors with the panels began to fade. Too many colors to even consider "re-painting" with painters markers. I bought SIX! Disappointing at any price.
1,This quit working within 2 weeks of installation.	Returned for a full refund.
1,They work fine but don't last very long.  In a year or less, they crapped out.  They are cheap in price, so you get what you pay for.
1,To be fair, my experience with setting up and using a plane is low, and I've never used one this small. For me, this plane proved to be useless. Plane was difficult to set up and the results were poor. The primary task was shaving off the left/right sides of some kitchen cabinets that were 1/8" too wide. I ended up using a Stanley surform plane.
1,I got two of them and connected the first one to my SmartThings hub. Connection was pretty easy it worked for couple of hours and got stuck indicating Wet forever. Tried to replace it with the second unit and couldn't get it to report properly even once. The sensor was in very short range and was beeping as I put it in water, the indication however was not reported by SmartThings.
1,I ordered 3 of these. These are new construction and not retro fit. One had DIRTY ELECTRICAL TAPE around the wires (but tested and still worked fine), the next was fine and the third was an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LIGHT!!!! They all look similar but after you take the grill off it had 25 blue LED's instead of the 10 yellow on the other 2. I already had an electrician there with an assistant who didn't realize that they were different so the hole that was cut was a different size by just a hair, but a enough that the correct one would no longer fit. I was forced to install it or fix the drywall and pay the electrician to come back and fix it (something amazon or the manufacturer should pay for) I called and explained and they only offered 20% back on the different colored light. This was by far my worst experience with amazon I have ever had.
1,Worst faucet ever. This is a 2 year old moderately priced faucet. Failed in 18 months. Shutoff valve started sticking after 6 months, and never noticed the constant drip puddle at the base of valve until it soaked my formica counters, which need to be torn out with the sink base cabinet. They are custom finished, so its about a grand to replace. I owned one other Pfister faucet and it needed a cartridge after every 1-2 years. Replaced with a Delta. The Depot Glacier bay or American standard are far superior to PF. Just avoid this maker.
1,This is a great little flood light with slightly warm (maybe 4000K temp) light in a small box.  It runs around 4 hours on high beam and was useful while I was renovating an apartment with no electricity.		Unfortunately, the charging cable included with the light doesn't fit well into the port and I had to shave off part of the cable to fit into the port.  And it only comes with a USB cable, so I had to use my phone charger in order to plug it in. Also, it is a little heavy.		This light worked great for maybe 8 charging cycles over 3 weeks, but now no longer charges even though the charging indicator light goes on.  Based on reviews, it looks like this is a problem in 5-10% of the lights.  If you get a good one, it is a good product.
1,Piece of junk.  It was returned
1,At about $5 a pop, these are fairly cheap LED bulbs, but not the cheapest. Before they fail, they work pretty well. I've had 3 of the original 10 fail so far. Two just stopped working, one melted the plastic nubs holding the actual LED board onto the heatsink/frame, and then it melted the globe some before one of the power wires fell off. Not exactly "Extremely Long life ,each bulb comes with a lifespan of 30,000 hours.". They supposedly had a 2 year warranty, but they aren't quite expensive enough to be worth the time, effort, and cost shipping back the broken ones, assuming the warranty would even be honored.
1,Guy is a crook!  I waited over 2 weeks and never got it and he won't respond to my email complain.		When I contacted Amazon I was told the seller was no longer accepting emails.
1,Piece of junk.  Bulb stopped working after one year. Motion sensor starting acting up after 6 months.  Save you money and don't buy this.
1,I still haven't figured out how to set it !!! INSTRUCTIONS NOT GOOD !!!
1,I was replacing a bulb that had worked for NINE YEARS (Hanstar daylight FCL22)	This GE bulb has a more yellow light even though it's described as "cool white", so I didn't like it that much anyway.	The seller only refunds, they don't replace even a defective bulb. And I have to pay to ship the silly thing back.
1,Came broken...
1,The product description doesn't give a lot of details about the what size screws accompany these hinges, nor the thickness of the hinge itself.		These hinges are 0.08" thick (14 gauge steel).  The hinges I was replacing are 0.12" thick (11 gauge steel).  They fit the doors, but there's a ridge around each hinge where the wood overhangs the hinge because it's thinner.  Not the end of the world, but it's clear that these hinges aren't terribly stout.		The screws that come with the hinges are 3/4" long #8.  The screws on the hinges that I'm replacing are 1 1/4" long #10 - thicker and longer.  It would have been great to know the screw gauge before ordering - these won't hold my doors up.		I'd be wary using them to replace existing hinges or using them on anything other than a lightweight hollow-core door.
1,Wanted to upgrade my kitchen faucet with a stylish, affordable alternative. Unfortunately, this faucet is virtually useless in all aspects except good looks. The neck is tall, but the radius is so short you can barely get your hands under it to wash them. Even worse if you have a double sink, so forget about washing a large dish or pot. The arc is meant to give more room and accommadate large pots. But since there's no more height clearance on this faucet than a pull-out, and a much shorter radius, it's actually less accommadating. By radius, I mean it doesn't reach as far over the sink as most pull-outs, so if you have a double sink you won't be able to fit anything under it without the wand/hose anyway. This is where the wand should come in handy, but that's also awkward and the flow is very weak. So in order to rinse or fill a large pot you have to hold the wand. The flow is so thready that takes several minutes. I'd like to mention water flow pressure in my house is more than adequate. All of my faucets have plenty of pressure to spray and rinse and even blast when needed, except this one. The Moen 5985 faucet seems to restrict the flow so much that it sometimes takes as long as a minute just to get the hot water up. The stream is thin and weak and the spray mode is an ineffectual trickle which has slowed to a dribble over just a few months use. I couldn't find a restrictor on the faucet, so I don't think that can be removed. Additional annoyances: the button that turns the spray mode on is press-and-hold. Even if the spray was effective (which it isn't), it only stays on if you hold the button. In every way conceivable except for looks, this faucet was a downgrade from my last faucet, an old, leaky, Delta pull-out. For the money and the Moen name, I expected SO much more.
1,I normally need size L gloves; these L size gloves are a little too small.  So if you're like me, and need an L, buy an XL with these.
1,Motion sensing did not work as well as I would have liked.
1,Only got one. Not the 4 pack. Buyer beware.
1,First, my pack came with only 2 little orb lights.  They claim that it's a pack of 4.  Second, these things DO NOT ROTATE.  They are solid plastic so the direction they aim at is where you get the light.  It's not all that practice and I ordered them specifically to be able to rotate them.  I'd send them back but it'd cost me more in shipping then to just shove these useless things in some corner in hopes that maybe I'll need them sometimes.
1,Not happy with design - when screwing two halves together, there are no built in guides to bring screw to not easily so when the screw travels it misses the nut.  Tolerance stack up for all parts off a bit - can be better engineered.
1,During the fourth quarter of 2008, I ran a 3 month long radon test in my home basement with AccuStar Labs Radon Kit.  At that time (December 2008) the results of radon test was 13.8 pCi/L.	On 03/14/2009 I purchased your 101 RadonSeal Standard Concrete Sealer product on Invoice Order #2149.  I prepared the floor which was to be sealed according to the instructions and applied your seal according to the instructions.	Several months later during the fourth quarter of 2010, I again ran a 3 month long radon test in my home basement with AccuStar Labs Radon Kit.  The test results were a disappointing 13.7 pCi/L.	RadonSeal paperwork & website stated in writing a money back guarantee but refused to honor my request after several attempts.  I invite RadonSeal to make good on their refund for the poor performance of their product for $169.00 on Invoice Order #2149.  I do not recommend this product at all and find the RadonSeal company to be a total scam having zero customer support and a very poor performing product.
1,Junk... May be my bionic eyes, but these LEDs flicker like mad... And with this they will not last long...
1,I tried using this as the time delay on make and time delay on break control for the furnace inducer fan.  I had wired it to be normally open (N.O.).  But it didn't work.  The inducer fan just kept running continuously once I switched power back on to the furnace.  Unsure if the product was defective.  The manufacturer's documentation is one small, folded piece of paper with a wiring diagram, brief general installation wording, and a brief mode of operation narrative.  The wiring diagram is vague and seems amiss with regards to the "initiate switch" wiring shown between the R wiring and G wiring.  I am returning this product for refund.
1,Could've sworn the description advertised the item as going up to the 405nm wavelength which is actually extremely important for the application I'm using it for. Unfortunately unboxed it and only noticed this by the label on the back of the light. Sucks to waste 40$ like that. On the plus side the light is really bright I guess so there's that, realistically though it's going to sit in a closet because I have no use for a light that only goes to 400nm. I must've read the description wrong because now it says 400nm, I must have selective reading or something because I swear on my life I remembered reading 405nm somewhere in this items description. Stuff happens
1,Cheap quality. Ok for the price.
1,I had a Stanley Leverlock for 20 years but the lines for the first few inches slowly scraped off making it hard to measure anything small.  This looked like a great replacement since it was one of the best rated, was also self-locking and had fractions which my tape didn't.  Also I liked the chunky, rounded soft look.  Now after a year of using this thing, my wife and I have grown to hate it.  I've put it away in the basement as a back-up and brought back up my old Stanley.		Here's why we hate it.  The self locking doesn't work that well.  If I rest it on the ground, the tape starts reeling in.  This is incredibly frustrating. So annoying.  I also hate that it's 3-3/8 or 3-5/8 long.  I suspected this going in but I didn't realize how often I added/subtracted the even 3" my old Stanley was when measuring.  I don't even bother trying to add/subtract 3-3/8 and over time not being able to do that has also become annoying. So here's what happened just today that made me put it away and write this terrible review.  I was trying to measure the height of where we're going to put our fireplace mantel.  Since I knew the measurement and didn't want to deal with the 3-3/8 I had to hold the tape and extend it to the floor.  With my Stanley I probably would have put the tape on the floor and extended the tape up, subtracting the even 3".  Easy peasy.  So now this wouldn't be a big deal but it was kinda cumbersome holding the tape with one hand and trying to mark on the wall. AND THEN the damn tape kept reeling in.  I had to use my knee to jam it against the wall so it wouldn't move.  Maybe mine's defective or it's worn out.  I dunno but I completely hate it.
1,NOT AS DISCRIBED
1,Moldy.  Ugh
1,Barely works.  Got it to punch extra holes so I could use my belts after I lost about 40 pounds.  It worked, but it took WAY too much effort.  I do not recommend buying this punch.
1,Have to say not really worth it I just ended up cutting the bolt dose not really grip just spins n makes it worse
1,Ordered arrived on time and it wasn't damaged, but sadly the 8 flashing modes don't work properly.
1,The batteries died after 11 months use.
1,Cheap plastic not worth the price.  Would not take much to break the lock.
1,As one of the other reviewers wrote-- this does NOT work with low-voltage lighting. If you verrrry carefully read the description it says that it works with halogen and incandescent.		Guess what-- that's only 120V halogen or incandescent bulbs. Yes- you may have a 120V line going to the lite fixture, but there could be a low-voltage transformer hiding in the fixture. To be sure, pull the bulb out. If it does not say 120V on the bulb, this dimmer will not work.		The worse problem is that I purchased the dimmer before the job started. Now that the job is completed, the dimmer goes in, it does not work, and..... yep, you guessed it.		I was outside of the Amazon return window. That's an expensive $48 that I have to eat.		It sure would be helpful if the product description specifically called out the incompatibility!
1,Had to modify it. Doesn't tighten on to all sink types well.
1,I agree with all the negative reviews.  These things are DANGEROUS!!!  I seriously think that the chinese might be trying to kill some of us with these torches. Sorry but that's just my honest opinion.
1,I've been skeptical on B&D products for a while for obvious reasons (material choices, design, construction of unit), and went on a limb to get the Mouse based on a friend's recommendation.  The mouse worked great initially for small projects and modelmaking, but completely failed within weeks of getting the device.  I have since gone through 2 more, but I simply return them to my local Home Depot from where I purchased it, and trade up for another new unit.  Needless to say, this works for me, but this is an example of poor product development decisions, flawed design for manufacturability, and B&D are basically hemorrhaging profits and consumer's good will by offering products that are returned over and over again.
1,really poor steel. They came very dull and had to be reground to work.
1,Very low current drive for the usb on 700ma.
1,Terrible. Thought it's similar to Levitons in store, but cheap piece of plastic
1,If you're purchasing to replace an existing one of the same model to replace fan and cover don't. Of course even though it's the same exact model the new components weren't compatible with the existing housing built into the ceiling.
1,Does not fit a 4 inch pipe - it exactly butts-up to the other 4 inch duct - not into or over it.  I bought this item to reduce the 4 inch hole on the PSI Woodworking DBGULP Big Gulp Dust Hood I bought for my table saw. I have had to make so many "adjustments" with duct tape to make my dust collection system operational. This fits exactly nothing and the industry seems to need to look up the word "adaptor" and "reducer" as this should fit either inside or outside a 4 inch hole (industry pick one and outside might be a better choice). I have run 2.5 inch pvc through my garage and have several of my dust makers installed (again duct tape to snug the fit in almost all cases). In my garage I don't need or want a 4 inch pipe.  All that said I blame myself for not looking at all the reviews however, the words reducer are grossly misused.  Providing measurements might have helped some.  It is sturdy hard plastic.
1,The steel of the bits is so soft that it strips in nearly any situation with hand torsion.		The magnetic bits transfer nearly zero of that magnetism to the screw, making that feature useless.		The case is dope, though.
1,letters to small
1,Product is very cheaply made when you move the ring it makes enough noise that it can be heard in the next room . I will be returning it for a different  brand .
1,Rusted horribly! Actually corrosion. Ran thru dishwasher and came out corroded.
1,Piece of crap, worked 1 time and that was. It!
1,Not the best attachment. Cuts a very shallow line and not the easiest piece to start a cut.
1,More fragile than glass
1,Poor Quality Control on these.  I ordered 2 boxes of these and the first box had 3 out of 6 bulbs that would not light.  I returned that box for a refund only to have 2 of the bulbs from the 2nd box die on me within a couple of weeks.  At this point it's not worth the hassle of finding the box and returning them, but I would not recommend.
1,plumber did not like.  didn't use it
1,I bought this fire starter 2 1/2 years ago from Amazon and used it for the first time this week. The compact fire starter's ferrocerium rod worked well and sparked nicely when use with a knife blade but the metal striker failed to produce any sparks.  Every once in a while it created a spark but it was too faint to ignite a vaseline soaked cotton ball. I've had a four dollar Coghlan's Flint Striker, rod and striker, from Amazon that work perfectly for years and I am still using it.
1,One job- drilled a total of 4  7/8" holes into 6" concrete, hit no rebar, clear sailing. Now the drive mechanism is stripped- won't turn under torque. I am a contractor and don't have time for crap tools.
1,What you get for $17 is just a little plastic bottle with a spout to aim upward from below.  The stream is not strong enough to do much real cleaning.  I think a spray bottle from Dollar Tree would work as well if not better.	Update:  My spray bottle from Dollar Tree does work better - I tried it.
1,The light is very dimm. Does not get bright enough also the beam to very concentrated. Far too narrow a scope.
1,Within a minute of turning it on, it got stuck in a white strobe pattern. Could not get it corrected even after unplugging.
1,Too large.
1,This did not work from day one. a waste of money. The return policy make syou eat the cost.
1,Amazon should stop selling this defective product. First of all when it rains, water leaks into the mason jar. I bought four and all but 1 stopped working after a few months. I wish I could get my money back.
1,For my purposes, this tool was a lot bigger than expected.  I'm sure it works great for large projects.
1,I love the idea of this Dewalt Power Station, the innovation is great.  To test it out with 4 fully charged flexvolt 9.0ah batteries.  I plugged in my freezer to test how long it it would work... and within 20 minutes it started smoking and melted down the freezer control board.  This is simply unacceptable.  I'm very disappointed with Dewalt, and it's costing me repair $$$$$ to my freezer.
1,Bought from Sears. It came completely out of square. It strikes the table insert when fully extended
1,Doesn't have charging light so you don't know when it is charged. Bought Skill instead.
1,It works, but it came bent. Disappointed
1,This looks good and matches our Blanco sinks, but the design of the stopper makes it difficult to use as a strainer.  It tends to want to close stop the water from draining.  We end up setting it on an angle which takes away from the ability to stop items from going down the drain.
1,Well it lasted 11 months. When using A/C I always keep it at 77 degrees when the A /C comes on as it should and the temp drops to 77 it doesn't shut off it keeps running but yet some how it still shows that it is 77 degrees in the house. My guess is that the display that shows you the inside temp is different than what it is actually reading like it has a separate thermometer that reads different?		I bought this in Nov 2013 and according to Amazon my return/refund ended in Jan 2014....seriously only 3 months?
1,Dull, crap, metal, incapable of cutting even soft copper wire. The handles flex so much they touch at the back.
1,I spent $9 on this from a hardware store and put it out for my ants to feed on ... I have had great success with the little inside ant traps.		The ants didn't go anywhere near any of the 3 outdoor baits I put out... .I finally cut one open and drizzled it on an ant trail and they just walked around it... nothing like the indoor bait. it's like they put ant repellant in it.		I wrote to terro hoping for some explanation, inquiry on product codes, etc (couldn't find any) and got no response to my multiple inquiries.		Unfortunately, I haven't seen anyone talk about an alternative brand, so I am going to try the 3lb shaker bag this year.
1,Low quality .
1,Update 1/1/16.  Top Greener replaced the faulty unit for me.  Yesterday a different one of these units stopped working but this one was able to be repaired by following the normal pairing sequence (the first one to fail was ticking like a bomb).  I'm not sure if this is the fault of the relay or the Vera controller.		Installation wasn't too bad, it took a few minutes to understand the wiring diagram but by the 3rd one it was pretty easy to put in.  I would be nice if the device was a tiny bit smaller so it would fit in the outlet box easier.  The wires are also pretty thin/cheap.		I purchased and installed 3 of these, and within 3 months 1 of them has already failed.  I contacted Enerwave's sales contact because their website's links for technical support and customer service don't work and haven't heard back in over a week.
1,I bought a Ryobi combination tool set from Home Depot.  The P102's lasted long enough to go out of warranty. I suspect planned obsolescence built into this product.  So, I took another chance and replaced the P102's with P108's.  So far, those seem to be much more reliable.  But, the P108's are in a whole different quality category than the P102's.		The P102 is the battery most often sold with Ryobi cordless tool kits.  Their reliability apparently depends upon the quality of the 'batch' which, (like P103's and 104's), can be traced to a specific serial number and year.  Do a search for toolboy's corner on your favourite search engine.  I didn't find this information until recently but anyone thinking about investing in throw-away cordless tools should look closely at this guy's data.  Though far from comprehensive, it offers vastly more information than Ryobi or HD will ever share with you.		It seems that the cordless tool racket is based on how many batteries can be sold.  The tools themselves are relatively good quality but the money seems to be in the batteries and/or battery replacement.  Even consumers on HD's own website rate the P102 south of 50%!  I don't see a lot of negative reviews with Ryobi tools.  Only some of their batteries suck.  The toolboy website has helped me a great deal.		Apparently, milli-amp hours (mAH) is what you pay for in a battery.  The P102's are supposed to be about 1.2 mAH.  And, that would be fine for most small jobs if they were reliable.  They're not.
1,This headlight at maximum would produce <1000 lumens, NOT the 1600 lumens described. The maximum power usage for this LED is about 10W (3.3V x 3A=10W) which could generate 910-980 lumens at best. FYI, the Cree XM-L T6 is a Cool White LED that is rated @ 5-8K with a CRI of 65. At best the output of this LED would be comparable to a little more than a 60W incandescent light bulb and I have attached a pic that compares the lumen output of LEDs to an incandescent bulb, and a CFL bulb if anyone is interested.
1,Doesn't make any noticeable difference in feel or smell of water or foaminess of soap or shampoo.
1,Love everything about this drill except the cheap directional switch and the wobbly chuck housing, which made it difficult to start a screw. Exchanged for another and it had the same wobble. Never seen a drill do this in all my 53 years. I blame it on the fact that almost nothing good comes from China. I should have known better. I went with a Milwaukee 0240-20, which is also made in China, but without the wobble, so I'll keep it. Unbelievable how aggravating it is to see manufacturing defects decade after decade coming from China.
1,I've been using Sunbeam Hot Shots for at least 25 years, and had one at home at a couple at work.  They're great.  But over the years, quality has declined, and I replaced a still-operating white model with this spiffy-looking black unit.  Big mistake.  I first noticed the cheap, plasticky feel, and hated the ultra-slow water dispensing, but within a week the dispense button simply broke off and could not be repositioned.  Back to Amazon it went.		I see that the older model (with the side-by-side heat and dispense buttons) is no longer available.  Too bad.  Sunbeam, you blew a perfectly good product.		Back story: Sunbeam used to be the largest manufacturer of small appliances in the US, if not the world.  It's products were consistently top rated by Consumer Reports.  The company fell on hard times, however, and in 1996 hired Albert ("Chainsaw Al") Dunlap, a slash-and-burn corporate raider whose shady deals almost ruined the company.  He was eventually sued by the SEC and Dunlap was ultimately banned from serving again as an officer or director of a public company.  Check Wiki for the Sunbeam story.		My original Hot Shot was made in the US.  Later, cheaper models all came from China.
1,These batteries work, and save a ton of money vs. OEM, but they are no where near as powerful.  The both lack the power to use large tools like impact drivers, and even when using smaller tools like a drill they last no where near as long as my original OEM batteries.  I plan on keeping them just to avoid the hassle but have to order a set of OEM batteries now to run the larger tools in my set.		Update: After just 2 months they have lost the ability to hold most of their charge.  Total waste of money.
1,It did not even occur to me that a plug-in CO detector would not have battery back-up, which is my fault for missing that.  However, what the??  I mean, they ALL should have batter back-up.  This one has to go back.
1,I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM
1,Chain length is not adjustable at all, so it will not lift at all when I push the flush handle.  False advertising.  For some reason, the manufacturer refuses to use words in the instruction manual, and only uses vague, unhelpful drawings.
1,Those are not high quality tips. They don't get transfer on the temperature evenly as the OEM tips. If you use those on the higher heat between 780-820f, the tips may get burn very quick and they don't look shine and perform as the temperature you are setting at!
1,Impossible to install. The color is poorly designed and 2 of the 3 plumbers couldn't install it.  I install the InSink Erator brand models my self in about 5 mins.  I struggled for over an hour then went through 2 plumbers.  Will never buy from this brand again.  Once installed it's a pretty good unit, as long as you never have to reinstall t.
1,Really disappointed with these. Tekton are a decent brand but these were cheaply made and you can feel it. Will it get the job done? Yes but i don't recommend it. It is made in China which we all know make horrible tools Tiwain make far better tools that are close to American made tools		Update: After a few months now they are starting to rust
1,Junk. Failed immediately on installation. Returned.
1,Super dim and horrible colors.  Don't bother with this.
1,after 1 month only 1 work. waste of money, have to stop buying from china!
1,THESE ARE WORSE THAN JUNK! RIPOFF FAILED AFTER A FEW DAYS.
1,As others have said, not a great quality piece of equip. My gun did not fit (trigger wanted to ready in the support) and the filter holder is flimsily attached.
1,I was annoyed and didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of a return but I definitely don't recommend this item it creates gaps between the item and the drain, so doesnt work well. It lets stuff goes down the drain instead of stopping it. Warped product. Horrible. Never purchasing it again.
1,I expected more.  This is a normal brown electrical socket, the "cover" is the white face that snaps into the screw hole in between the two sockets.  It does not include the wallplate shown in the second picture of the item.  I was disappointed because I had thought the "cover" was the screwless wallplate shown.  I now need to purchase the wallplate separately which doubles the price for what I wanted.
1,worked great....for 18 nights. then stopped. opened it up to see this....
1,Bought this drill after reading other comments and I said what the heck I will give it a try. I used it for work as a contractor and is by far the worst drill I have ever used. It has a good amount of power and works great for drilling through walls and concrete, but for your normal screws and bolts...it will nearly take your finger off it wobbles so much. DONT BUY. I have had 3 Dewalt drills and this is the first one I have had problems with.
1,Although they look like they might be high quality, one of them snapped in two the first time I applied over 30lbs torque using a torque wrench.  Thankfully, I was not injured and nothing of value was broken in the process.  I threw the rest out.  Junk.
1,The machine works, but the rollers for it are junk.  They are only supplied in 3/8" or 1/2" nap.  The rollers are expensive and hard to find.  1/4" nap works better for smooth walls.		I bought this to paint my newly finished basement.  I painted the celling with it, and after two coats it still did not look right.  I moved on to the walls, and the finish it was producing was streaky and transparent.  I got suspicious, so I broke out the conventional rollers with 1/4" nap.  Perfect finish from the standard roller on the first coat.		This machine is a good idea, but the roller selection for it is too limited.  Another con is the machine takes at least 30 minutes to clean properly.  If the paint valve leaks, you're in for a mess. (ask me how I know)		I'm sad I wasted the money & time on this thing.  I'm glad some of the other reviewers liked it, but I found that this machine was not for me.  I ended up returning it and getting my money back.
1,This product came with missing parts,  more exactly there's no screw on this cage whereas the image clearly shows a screw included. Lame quality too.
1,garbage. doesn't work
1,They don't fit my sink
1,When they work, I like them, however they only occasionally work. Meaning, the PIR sensor does not always sense my hand under the unit, my arm moving under the unit (crosswise, as across the field, not radially, I know how PIR's work!) and then only sometimes, rarely, does the unit turn on.		I got these friday, put fresh duracells in them, and installed them under some kitchen cabinets. They worked okay then. Since then the performance seems to have degraded. Now, it seems only 1 time in 10 do the come on without me having to 'fiddle' with them (pull them off, open the battery compartment, close the compartment, shake them, put them back on) measuring the voltage of the duracells, they all show over 1.6 volts.
1,No Number stamped on blades. Marginal printing on Fat Max Logo. Lots of oil on the blades. These feel counterfeit. Tried to contact Stanley but their form was broken (after filling it out! - what a waste of time.) I paid for the brand and looks like I got cheap counterfeits. Not worth the hassle of returning. Never again.
1,I'm going to return it.. Haven't even turned it on.. Watch YouTube review by Connor Wolf on this.. He does a complete tear down of this unit.. Made me a bit uneasy.
1,Paint is absolute garbage - goes on inconsistently creating blotches of glossy and dull areas. Paint coverage is poor, requiring 3-4 coats.	Instead of this, buy the Rust-Oleum 7592838 Professional High Performance Enamel Spray Paint.
1,Ordered two and neither of them worked. Dissapointed.
1,I bought this primarily to control power to a subwoofer when I turned on my receiver. It works good enough for me in that respect.		First of all, this thing has a power switch on the side that controls power to all outlets. The switch has an LED light. There's also two more LED lights on the front.		There's no switch or toggle to control its sensitivity, so you might be stuck if you try to use it with a device that uses too much power in standby mode.		For example, when my TV is turned off (in standby mode), and it's plugged into the master outlet, the controlled outlets either don't turn off or flicker on and off rapidly. It works perfectly with standby mode for a PS3 and PS4, and works well enough with my Yamaha receiver. For the Yamaha, it doesn't turn off power to the controlled ports until about 7 minutes after I put the Yamaha into standby. This might be the Yamaha's fault though.		I took a look inside and the auto-on/off circuitry primarily consists of a small standard relay (these things click when turned on and off - this is normal), and a donut-shaped device that appears to activate the relay when current passes through it (the power wire for the master outlet goes through the donut).		All electromagnet relays will fail given enough time. Now, I'm just hoping this one will last at least a couple of years. I'll update this review if it fails.		----------	Update 2 weeks later:		It no longer works for me. The switched outlets now rarely turn off with my Yamaha receiver (in standby mode - with no changes made to it), and when it does switch off, it switches on and off rapidly when the receiver turns on.		I get the same rapid on/off switching with my TV, but at least it now turns off more reliably. Though one major issue with it is that turns on and off randomly when the TV is in standby mode.		Overall, I can't recommend this if you plan on using it with a master device that doesn't fully power off (goes into standby mode). PCs that you shut down and older devices that turn off fully (via a power switch), should work great for it. But you'll be taking a risk if you expect it to work with a modern device that goes into a standby mode.
1,I've had the Joy Bidet for just over two months.  A few weeks ago, we noticed that the unit would not shut off completely without turning the knob back and forth.  Inconvenient, but at least it seemed to work.  Yesterday my wife used the bidet and turned the bidet off.  Just as she was getting up, it turned itself on full stream.  I won't go into the details, but if we weren't home it could have been a real mess.		There are a few other problems with the bidet.  The "T" is cheap plastic.  I actually thought that might be the first piece to fail.  Some of these devices are curved along the back to fit better the curve on the toilet.  This one is straight.  No big deal you might think, but when I took this off after two months it's evident that because of the straight section lots of "stuff" gets splashed up under the seat.  The screws were already starting to rust and along with the other stuff, there were rust stains on the toilet.  If the bidet hadn't malfunctioned, the rusting may have ruined the finish on the toilet.  I think a lot of these products might have the same problem, there is a lot hidden where you can't see.  As these products are cheaply produced, we get what we pay for. I added some pictures of how the device is constructed, so you can see how really flimsy it is. Use the ruler for scale and you'll see that the valve that controls the spray is tiny. (It's even smaller than you think as the actual valve in inside the housing).  As another reviewer stated " The small diameter tubing used inside the unit means it has a lower water-pressure than other units. The valve is a two-piece plastic design that is held together by the external housing of the unit, I had it blow into two pieces from standard water pressure when testing it. After looking at the quality of parts I am afraid to leave it connected to water and expect to come home and find the unit blown apart and leaking water."  All this is clearly visible in the pictures.		If the manufacturer improved the design and used better components, this would be fine as the bidet function worked well when it wasn't playing water park in my bathroom.		Addendum:		I decided to try a Luxe Bidet and while ordering I found that 2Go Products distributed both products.  I contacted their customer support and they were very responsive.  I received a the Luxe Bidet at no charge.  They did ask me to reconsider my initial review if I thought it appropriate and after experiences with both I do have things to add.		I am still concerned about the valve in the Joy Bidet, but it does have some worthwhile qualities which became apparent once I had some points of comparison.  Compared to the Luxe Bidet (Model 110)  it has two advantages.  It doesn't flex as much and the stream is much more pleasant.  The Luxe is a more stylish looking bidet, but because of the thinness of the arm, control pod flexes when you apply any downward pressure.  The Joy Bidet looks big and clunky, but is a much sturdier feeling device when you are using it.  The stream are completely different. The Luxe Bidet has a faster, thinner, sharper stream and the Joy Bidet has a fuller stream without as much velocity.  In my opinion, the Joy Bidet wins hands down and is much more comfortable.		In conclusion, if you can live with the sub-par valve and the clunky appearance, the Joy Bidet Functions wonderfully and is a pleasure to use.
1,Let me tell you one thing about reviews on marketplace sites - most of them are handled by PR departments of respective manufacturers. You need to learn to filter these correctly. Would you write 2 page review just because you thought something was OK? I don't think so.		I have received 1 that had a terrible runout in the spindle so was pretty much walking on the benchtop by itself. I replaced it. I received the replacement today - guess what - VIBRATIONS.		You saw the video on youtube when they put a 1c coin on top of it to demonstrate how well-balanced it is?	BULL		Thing is just JUNK, nothing else to say really.		Ah, whatever you do - DO NOT ORDER from CPO , they won't send you a return label, they will make you drive over to full service FedEx station with a barcode to have label created for you. What a waste. So many other tools I ordered were dirty, damaged, improperly packed etc. Their customer service is so lacking too.		Update: got 3rd one today, also garbage, will just return for refund.

Starter leaking about a month after installed.
1,This thing might be sturdy enough to support the weight of a Dremel tool but not a flexible shaft motor. The plastic is thin enough that when you tighten it down it flexes... that's no bueno.
1,Got this for my garage and I started having trouble with it staying on at times.  We noticed it does not fit snugly into the socket the first time we screwed it in.  We would wiggle it or move it a little with a broom handle and it would turn on.  First I thought it was my chain pull attachment that was the problem so we removed it.  When that didn't work we finally replaced the ceiling fixture and it still had to be wiggled and moved to get it to work.  Finally it has gotten to the point that it was just too frustrating to put up with it so we replaced it with a round bulb LED and it works perfectly.  I give it two stars because I have had it for several months so I felt one star wasn't fair.  But if I had realized it was the bulb at fault immediately upon installing it I would give it one star.
1,Not very useful
1,lights are too dim for outdoors.  i would not purchase any additional ones.  however, if you just need a very soft light without much power, it is small and may work for you.  i wanted to use it to light up some small plants that are in large pots in my garden but these  produce a very weak and dim light.
1,Don't but this. Junk. Bent the shaft on start up, didn't even touch the wood.
1,didn't last the year - the battery contacts rusted - disappointed - another item for the landfill - ugh
1,Sent it back, not so groovy, didn't work.
1,it is not 1000 lumens.	ordered 4 - 1 came broken	1 more will blink if moved to fast		there is a reason why this cost as much as it does
1,Was trying to replace with the same model, however... Will not progress from one time period to next in 2 program/day mode.  Will not enter into fan refresh mode in programmed mode (either 2 or 4 pgm/day mode).  Then you have all the other issues listed by others here. Recommendation: If you want a Hunter thermostat, look at model 44905 - it's cheaper and Hunter appears to have fixed the programming issues.
1,We bought these at a discounted price to try out LED lighting.  Overall, the lights do look very nice and you have a large options of colors. However there are a few major flaws.	1. These have the exposed circuitry.  Therefore you need to ensure placement is in a hidden place otherwise you will see it.	2. They throw off a lot of heat.  I would not feel comfortable with them being near any kind of ignitable (curtains for example)	3. The remote works off and on.  It also gets interfered with by a standard tv remote or receiver remote.	4.  The range on the remote is very short.		I would not recommend these if you plan on using them for constant use.  Although they are cheaper then most sets, the price reflects the build quality.
1,these are very poorly made and are useless for anything I've tried to use them for.one of the handles was badly bent and one was somewhat bent.	the caps on the ends opposite the screw ends are floppy and slippery and should have something non slip on them. I put velcro on them which helped some. All in all a poor product. Also the depth of clamps this large should be much deeper.
1,As near as I can tell, this is a great product if you have fairly specific needs.  It is not the do-all flashlight sheath it claims to be.		Here's how it breaks down:  The sheath is designed to stretch to fit, up to, a D cell flashlight, and keep it snuggly on your hip.  It will do this.  However, it is very snug.  Any flashlight larger than a Mini Maglight will be difficult to deploy with one hand. I tried to fit my Fenix E-21, which isn't that much bigger than a Mini, and it really took two hands and a few seconds.  Furthermore,  no flashlight, including a Mini-Mag, just slips into the holster without a little fiddling (although I think a little practice with a Mini Mag would fix this problem).		The click rotating clip is really nifty, and I could see it being very useful.  If this is the feature you most want, then you can't do better.  The clip rotates easily and it is very secure.  In fact, it is a little too secure, in that, it is a little awkward to put on and take off of a belt.		Also remember, there is no flap on this holster.  Your flashlight is exposed on both ends.		It's cordura and seems to be super durable.  The price-point seems about right.		So, if you need the rotating clip, need your flashlight to be very secure on your belt, and/or use a Mini Maglight, I think this product is about right.  However, if you regularly take your flashlight out of its sheath, or use a any flashlight larger than a Mini, I think you can do much better.
1,We thought these were a great idea when we bought them for our remodeling and wallpaper business.  And we bought a bunch of them from our local paint store.  We had to designate them for outdoor use after several unpleasant experiences.  The first time we had a problem we thought is was because of the malfunctioning thermostat on the newly installed radiant heat in the house we were working on.  When we pulled the drop cloths we could see the dot pattern in the brand new prefinished hardwood floor.  It took A LOT of buffing with a microfiber towel to remove the marks from the whole room.  Not to soon after we used them in a bathroom with marble floors.  Again black dots. This time it was where ever we had set our ladder feet.  Those marks we never were able to remove and ended up paying the marble installer to come back and clean the mess.  Very expensive and very embarassing.  I think they used real rubber and it just wears after a while.  Maybe if you're just using them on carpet it would be ok, but we're never bring them inside again.  And if you just use them on carpet you don't need the grippy dots - just get a regular drop cloth.  What the point?
1,Way overpriced
1,I agree with the reviewer who said "it's like getting a new pair of glasses." This lamp offers the best light I've ever experienced. For this quality of light, I don't even mind paying the price of the bulb--especially since the original bulb lasts for a very, very long time. And I love the look of the lamp as well.		BUT, and here is a very, very big but. . . .  The stem of my lamp broke off from the base after only a few months of use. The light quality was so invaluable to me that I kept the lamp by my reading chair, despite its broken akimbo look (tilting at almost 90 degrees). Then, after what must have been three years of use, the bulb burned out.  Because I was so dependent on this lamp for everyday use, I went to Ace and bought a GE bulb equivalent to the original Verilux bulb. Night and day difference!! The GE version was much yellower and dimmer. BUT, and another big but. When I unscrewed the plastic cover over the lamp bulb (to get the burned out bulb), the interior attachments for the cover simply self-destructed and fell on the floor. (I assume the constant heat of the lamp dried out these little white sticks (I don't know how else to describe them), and they fell into chalk-like bits. Hence, absolutely no way to reattach the plastic cover!! I began to think how I could "fix" things. Rubber bands around the dome didn't work because the heat destructed them and they flew across my room. I have now thought perhaps I can find just the right wire and wind that around the dome to hold the plastic cover in place. I know, however, that will be ugly and drive me crazy. (I am an art historian, and design is very important to me.)		Now it's true I've had the lamp for a few years. But planned obsolescence is against my personal beliefs!! So disappointing. The lamp is perfect, until it's not. And sadly, it's "not" phase comes after too few years of use.
1,Description states that it comes with rip fence. Sent one back because rip fence was not in box. 2nd one received, once again no rip fence. Very misleading! Saw is appears to be very good quality.
1,It almost fits. That is all I have to say
1,Unknown chinese foam with zero information about what materials its made from.  Ended up returning it and getting something else.  Don't risk putting no-name/zero information products in your home folks, it's not worth it.
1,In the instruction it states that the switch can be trained by turning off the light after it goes on within the first five seconds if there is sunlight in the room.  I have tried like several dozens of time and it wouldn't do it so it will go on even when the sun hits on the switch directly at the sensor.  :(		Please do not buy.  Had I known, I would not have purchased them.
1,We really liked these but the Green lasers quit after about a week. Would be 5 stars if it lasted. Returning to Amazon
1,Cheap cheap plastic.  Will not survive any real world use because the plastic is extremely brittle.
1,The little led lamps are to weak to do any good with lighting up the subject you are trying to see.  You will need a desk lamp aimed at your work to use this to any effect.
1,I would love to give a great review of this item, however, I ordered this item over a month ago. I was told that it would be shipped to me by a date three weeks later and I still don't have the item. I also sent an e-mail to the place I ordered it from and as of yet, I have received no response from them. If I do get my shipment, I will be back to this site to give the item a review. The place I purchased it from is very low on my list right now. They need to make this right. If they do? I'll change my response. They have a week to contact me...
1,Did not produce enough light for my needs. I expected BRIGHT fluorescent light, dim by comparison. May work for those of you whop do not require bright white lighting.
1,Cadillac should be horse whipped for coming up with a special tool required to remove drain plug. Also no way to get a torque wrench on it so you may strip your threads.
1,The concept is very nice and I love the flexibility, but the product does not retain a charge.
1,A high end flashlight like this should work first, ten for many years.  Put fresh batteries inside, pressed the only button on the flashlight and nothing.  This one is going back !!!
1,crapy.
1,i don't like it
1,01/10/18 update	- two filaments burnt out on all the bulbs installed on my hallway. Updated rating accordingly		I use these AmazonBasics 60 Watt Dimmable light bulbs for my desk lamp. They produce very nice warm white lighting which is perfect for reading books and working with my computer. These LED bulbs are very energy efficient and don't feel hot to touch. Perfect long term energy efficient replacement for the incandescent bulbs.
1,It's too small for deeper drawers, and also too small for longer handles.  For almost $200 I thought it would have a little more flexibility  So, I guess they're get you for another $100+ buying the extension piece.  It's well made, but for that price, they could have included a case and a little bit more to work with.  Not really worth your purchase.  Just make your own jig, plenty of videos online you can learn how.
1,failed to work...loved the idea and really needed it...but hate that the combo portion of the lock would not open once set.  I had to return it.  Glad for a great return policy!
1,Plastic, cheap, sent back!!
1,I purchased this for a gift exchange for approximately 20 guys and I thought it would be a "hit" item. In reality nobody wanted it. It looks better and sharper in the picture online than in real life. It seems cheaply made, from low-grade thin sheet metal. The brand name sticker was glued on crookedly on mine. The whole thing reeked of cheap Chinese quality. I would not recommend buying this unless you see it in person and decide that you actually like it. The picture is somewhat misleading.
1,Super cleaned the wood, fully dry, applied the sticker in a 70 degree temperature. Was ok for day one, day two started lifting from corners. By the end of the day it was more hazardous than good. So ditched it all.
1,Rarely used  . . . still burnt out in less than 2 months
1,Well, initially it seemed bright enough, although not as bright as a regular cfl.  Over a short time it faded and put out less and less light - not enough for a porch light to direct someone's path.  As far as insects... I don't think it repelled any, but the fact that it put out so little light did not draw them.
1,Do not buy the warehouse deals version of this product.  This is my second review because apparently I was a little too honest and too expressive of how I really felt.  So I hope this review is mellow enough for the good people or robots that approve reviews.  So I purchased this six back of bulbs expecting LED's only to recieve someone's USED incandecents.  But it had the "amazon inspected" sticker on it, so everything is ok... not so much.  I would only buy these new, and I wish I could let you know how they work, but the ones I recieved were not the actual product.  Great job guys.
1,Will change the review when I find out from Makita about warranty.		I was drilling through a 2x4 about 3 months after I bought it and it just died.  Not the battery, the drill itself.  No power is being carried through the wafer like circuit board from the battery.		I've gotten a different model since and that one seems ok, however this one is currently dead and I am awaiting to hear back from a Makita repair center.
1,First and second sink were warped
1,Very bright flashlight....but it heats up after only about a minute of use. If you don't care about the heat then this flashlight is good.
1,NOT SUITABLE IF SUBMERGED IN WATER!!! It dries a beautiful glossy black and stayed that way for about 2 days in my pond after I filled it. I let it dry for 3 days a month ago in AZ where the daily temps were between 82-96 degrees with no rain. After 2 days of filling it up, the entire Rubberseal product turned algae brown and now is permanently this color. There are some spots that had less than 1/4" thickness and the section below would never dry. You have to stab it and sometimes fill it with sand but still those areas are brown too. It's now been drained for 3 weeks and some of those spots simply will not dry and those spots are blistering as the heat increases to around 100+ degrees daily here.		The other really big issue with this stuff is while it does have a hard feeling to the touch when dry, when submerged in water it softens up. So when you go to clean your pond, especially if you have to use a scoop to remove the last bits of water, you will tear this stuff. That's really bad because then the water can get underneath the coating and will destroy it from both sides. You could easily take a finger nail lightly to this stuff and you will scrape up goo rather than your finger nail drag across it like you'd expect with a hardened surface.		$130 gone, the cleanup was not fun nor the effort applying it though the application effort is great overall, my pond is destroyed, I now have the worst cleanup job I could  imagine next to shoveling feces for a living but at least feces aren't laden with chemical and feces can actually wash off. You need to use kerosene to get this off your skin and everywhere else you get it and you will get it everywhere if you don't lay down drop cloths. There's no such thing as a refund for a project like this so basically I took a gamble and lost everything I went in with and so much more.	I'm confident this would be a wonderful roof patch or roof coating however even then it's black so that's generally not ideal unless say you're in the upper portions of the hemispheres.	In the picture attached you can see what a coat after 1 week looks like at the bottom which is all cracked, and then the walls where I didn't do another coat and you can see it is exactly the opposite of what you'd want, algae and very rough brown.
1,WAY TOO LIGHT WEIGHT.  This thing is so light that it tips over and moves all over the workbench, instead of cleaning the iron.  Also, there is only enough wire medium to fill about 1/3 of the housing - nothing at all like the picture - so the medium sits at the bottom of the container and you have to insert the iron deep inside, making only minimal contact.  In fact, it's downright difficult to remove all the oxidation from the tip and takes a lot of unnecessary effort.  My opinion: stick with a sponge and water.
1,not that bright, I still have to install Extra Lights, in the Area.
1,So the mechanism is good but the plastic bottle is very poor quality. Read the other reviews and you'll see this is a common trend. It most cost 0.10 cents to make it splits in between the threads for everybody.
1,Dont buy these they are very over priced, in the world of pen kits.
1,Leaks from the base after 3 months.  I think it is designed to last a few weeks longer than the return period.
1,The sprayer itself looked very nice, and had a metal feel, but the hose was laughable. It was shiny black rubber and all linked up.  So cheap! I returned cause I couldn't get over it.
1,It looks great, but is VERY poorly designed and quickly becomes loose or unusable. I have 3 toilet paper holders and 5 other towel bars etc. from this line.  I DO NOT recommend them.		1. Wall mounting screws are too close together and easily break free of wallboard because they are separated by less than 3/8 inch.	2. Mounting bracket bends easily (cheap aluminum?) and will no longer hold the arm securely if bumped after installation.	3. Set screw holding arm to bracket is extremely hard to tighten because it is tiny, the angle is tough, and the head strips easily.	4. Even when installed properly and mounted to a stud (!), the arm is not tight, which creates a rocking motion every time TP is removed from the roll.		There are many alternatives to this model -- buy them first.
1,Lite buffing is fine. Pressure buffing shreds the material. I won't buy this brand again.
1,Didn't work Didn't turn off or on.
1,I use in the bathroom...very sensitive.... the light is not very bright but great for a midnite trip to the bathroom...not super bright but good lighting to see well. UPDATE 4/19 Out of the blue it started staying on and on and on...or going off then on without motion.....I loved it while it lasted but it didn't work that long....
1,Absolutely did not work as described and followed the instructions precisely.
1,Push the button for 10 min it may stay on for 10 but most of the time it shuts off at 4 min.  Set it for 20 min and it shuts of in 5 min.	Returned it, I should have read the reviews.
1,The display is dim when it sits in the truck and gets hot. Very hard to see if at all. Makes it useless until it cools down.
1,Terrible quality. Got dull after 2 inches of cutting 1/8 mild steel
1,They put this useless un-refrigerated box on the bottom, which means the motor and all of the plumbing had to be relocated to the top, making this thing is very top-heavy. They give you an anchor to help with that, but I'm not drilling into my hardwood floors to keep this thing in place. The refrigeration is terrible. After running for hours, the water is barely cool, definitely not cold. The paddles to work the spouts are flexible and cheap. They feel as if they're going to break. And because it's so top-heavy, you can't push too hard on the water lever without holding the cooler with the other hand or it'll tip over.
1,Cool knife, it's just screw/joint that the blade swings from tends to tighten the more you open and close the knife. You have to loosen the screw often to keep it from doing this. Also, the saw edge (the jagged side) chips easily.
1,4 month update!		well after about 4 month it has completely lost it's sharpening ability. minding that i do a lot of cutting, and I used this on every knife around the house. However i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer. all an all i'm going to switch to sharpening stones.		My Initial review:	Sharpens the knives like never before! you need to know how to use a sharpening rod though ( plenty of youtube videos on it). rod usually alight the blade and not sharpen it though with this one you can sharpen the blade. works very well on a variety of steel grades.
1,Worked for about 10 min showed my wife I had fixed it we were all happy and then tried to start it back up again to make sure it still worked and nothing waste of my time and money
1,Not sure why the good reviews. I'll be brief: app very slow and always syncing with any update or loss of hub signal; contrary to other reviews app is not practical and easy to use for troubleshooting-cumbersome and time consuming; remote response is sluggish and even with hubs the signal is poor; doesn't always recognize commands. Definitely not worth the enormous price! Another product with a lot of promise and no delivery. I do NOT recommend! Returning for refund. What a downward different from the awesome Harmony One!
1,When fully open, volume is reduced by about 60% because flap only opens to a 30 angle or so. Also, flap does not close to anything close to a complete seal. Also, I doubt whether the flap will even open or close with any certainty or longevity.		Was it a good buy? Yes: it was a goodbye to $18!
1,No instructions came with item.	I do not know how to make it work properly.	No good to me..
1,This is a well-built tape measure.  The self-lock mechanism allows you to pull the tape out and it then automatically locks in place.  To retract the tape you simply press the release button down.		The self-lock feature worked great when the tape was new tape.  However, when there is dirt or sawdust on the tape (which is most of the time), the lock mechanism doesn't hold the tape.  Instead, the tape slides slowly back into the housing.		Update: Over the last 3 years I have tried numerous ways to get this self-locking to work.  I now just shove a wooden wedge in the tape opening.  I'll never buy another one of these self-locking tapes.
1,These will be fine for extra visibility as they are billed, but are probably closer to 150lum, my 300lum flashlight is much brighter.  Light is definitely spot and not flood, narrow beam.
1,The package said it was a BG-3500, but it was much larger than a BG-3500. Had to send it back.
1,I have used this item on different projects and always satisfied. On the label it is described and safe to use in a pond to seal concrete. Well I wanted to know more details about the curing time.  I contact the manufacture and confused. ThThe representative told me that this was not to be used in the pond that it was toxic and little micro pieces of it would break off and kill fish. But he contradicted what was on the label I didn't ask why he didn't offer why he said what he said but Im gonna call back and doublecheck it. If he maintains that it is not to be is what its listed for I believe its false advertising?
1,The Light output was ridiculous but the quality especially for the price, is subpar. It weighs maybe 2lbs, and feels like thin aluminum. Also the twist to turn on is too soft, it would turn on while in my pocket. The clip broke after a month and the light didn't work too well after 3 months (would flicker while on the full on position)	Overall it was a great light but for the price I don't think so.
1,MADE FROM CHEAP MATERIALS THAT STRIP OUT VERY QUICKLY.  IF YOU HAVE REAL WORK TO DO, LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR YOUR BITS
1,I bought two and after a couple weeks of use one of the clamps will not tighten due to a malfunction in the quick release. Extremely frustrating to use as it will grab properly on occasion so I'm dumb enough to keep going back to it.
1,I live in a rural area.  Power outages are COMMON.  This unit loses the clock and settings every time we have a 3 second power blip.  It has no battery CONTRARY TO WHAT THE SPECS SAY, and there is NO WAY to back up the 20-30V it gets from the furnace.  Classic case of hi-tech not being able to do what low-tech did --- set it to 55 degrees and be able to walk away for a few weeks in the wintertime without pips freezing. I'd send it back but a contractor installed it.  I plan to replace with a simple, rotary, mercury thermostat.
1,Cheap quality, didn't take 30 minutes before starting falling apart. The arm which should hold your object is very loos and there is no way to tighten it. I'm shopping for a better quality one.
1,Nice product, doesn't come with a plug! Doesn't make much sense to me.. that's like buying a new car without an engine.
1,Highly recommend at $42.99 which is what I paid, but at $99. you are just getting ripped off!	NOT WORTH $99. WELL WORTH $42.99
1,I don't know what I'm doing wrong but these do not stay up in the shower. I followed all the instructions exactly, cleaned off the tile with alcohol, (it was already clean but I wiped it with alcohol just to be sure), applied the adhesive and put up the hooks. I waited several hours before hanging anything on this. During the night, after a shower, the hooks fell off. I tried again, using new adhesive pads and again cleaned the tile with alcohol. This time I let it sit for over 24 hours before using the shower. Once again, within an hour or two, the hook fell off.	I see other reviews that rave about these hooks for the shower so I'd love to know what I'm doing wrong as I really need something like this.
1,some cables loosed inside, did not work
1,Piece of crap. Not sturdy and broke at the threads right away. i returned it, junK!
1,I needed a longer sweep
1,This item came broken from the factory. Amazon made it easy to return.
1,Beginning:  QUIET, maybe too quiet.		Middle:  CHIRPING, even with new battery(s) and reset.		End:  CUSTOMER DISSERVICE looks for and creates reasons not to replace the unit under warrantee.		Makes a plopping sound as it goes into the TRASH!
1,Was looking for drop-in replacement (no drilling of new holes) for Blum lazy susan hinge but even when extended all the way, no hole alignment for this part. Too bad, thought these were universal.
1,pass on this one- simply to dim	If you are buying this because it looks like a rock then you will be happy. It looks like a rock with a small solar panel on the top.	I assume most will buy this to illuminate a tree, fountain or statue at night. If you buy this for illumination you will be disappointed.	I put this in front of a fountain to light it at night. It does not project enough light. It is amazing how poor this is; from 10 feet away	one can not even see the fountain will this "spotlight" on it. I have many LED solar lights in my yard. This one bye far is the worst.	Complete junk.
1,Worked well for a few months then abruptly died.
1,I bought 3 bulbs and each light bulb has different temperature (warmth /light) range.  The color difference is very noticeable since they are next to each other with my arrangement. Better quality control is needed in my opinion.
1,One works great one does not pick up motion unless your hand is right on it. The backing that holds the light up has 4 little arms that hold it up, 3 broke while installing. Bright and adjustable on area it lights up.  Would send back but have never returned anything.  If you order hope both work for you.
1,Bought this 7/18/16 ordered replacement for it 4/2/16. Hot water will not turn off. Good luck getting the sprayer out it's holder. I went by the Amazon reviews of 4.2 stars. Conclusion overpriced junk, and made of plastic (hybrid material, please)
1,OK. First of all, I'm a Ryobi nut. I could be a commercial for them because I have so many of their power tools. When I saw this inflator I was psyched! And then I tried to inflate a tire... Good god, it MIGHT fill up a tire if you have a couple batteries and an afternoon! It may be great for blowing up footballs but much else is not really gonna happen! Sorry Ryobi, this one is a FAIL!
1,Could be a good product if manufactured properly.  They are are not properly bent so they don't lay against the door properly.  It causes the door to stick out and not look right.  You get what you pay for.
1,I like the multitude of colors that were offered however, it was a bit cheesy looking and cheap when the Dome was put over top as the lights and turned on in the dark. I would spend a little bit more to get something that was a higher-quality projection. Good for a toddler or an infant who doesn't really care about the quality.
1,I bought two sets for a total of 12. They look good BUT some work, some don't......... and as another reviewer stated, the labels on the stems are insanely difficult to remove and in trying to remove these labels you could end up damaging the finish. Keep looking........
1,I received my sink on time, but it did not have any hardware, mounting instruction, bracket, or drain. I can not believe it was only to be the sink, with no hardware or mounting bracket, let alon, no drain.
1,More for a submarine or factory than my residence. Seems to be made of good quality but I did not put up due to the look and feel, not very homey.
1,They don't last long
1,no good for Porcelain tile ,it just won't cut well!
1,Week 5.. 2 leds burnt out already.
1,Grinding stones are too soft to grind anything harder than marshmallow without falling to pieces.  Decidedly not worth the money.
1,3M makes quite a few of these N95 masks packages. This package is inexpensive but the edge of the mask is sharp. It means when you wear one for more than a few minutes, it cuts into your face. I would not buy this package again.
1,You get what you pay for.  Note that some models have no batteries to save information so once you unplug the device all data collected is gone.  On this model, the directions are unclear and unnecessarily complicated.  I mistakenly thought it needed replacement batteries and removed the screws.  Don't bother.  I recommend a different monitor that does offer batteries.
1,SUPER LOUD!!! The only thing I like is that the heater works extremely fast.
1,Purchased on the claim that it fits all interior doors, well it doesn't. It uses a 1" latch so if you have an interior door less than 1-3/8" don't buy this. I had to combine the knobs from this with my original latch so I could use the 7/8" hole in my door.
1,This is a beautiful flashlight, well made, great features. One missing feature-reliability. I bought the first one and loved it. So I bought 2 more as lighting deals. Over a 3 month period.	The first one stopped charging after a few weeks. Second about a week. The third about the same. None were mistreated not dropped, Immersed in water or anything else. They all stopped the same way. When plugged in to charge a flashing orange blinking light.would not turn on. Switched to new battery, nothing	I was super enthusiastic about this flashlight.
1,Item looked very nice when I first opened  product packaging box. However,  the box  did have a noticeable, inward dent on the top, I might add. When I plugged in the usb cord to the suggested  sites such as an outlet  hub, my desk top, an external battery, the light went on as expected. The bulbs did not give off any heat and the three settings seemed to work. I really like the way the lamp folded back upon itself, hearing the soft audible clicks when the joints fold out and fold back in. Problems arose when I inserted the AA batteries as directed and did not receive any light. After checking the batteries which were new and unused and similar (AA standard not rechargeable) The lamp would not light. I switched to rechargeable batteries and still no light. A working battery feature is what I needed for the lamp's usefulness  in my emergency kit. Returned.
1,I have purchased 3 house's worth of Decora switches in the past 8 years--ALL installed by a top notch electrician. They consistently fail, the internals of the switch break (or short out) and they have to be replaced. While a switch may not cost a whole lot ($5-10) the cost of replacement (and hassle) dwarfs the cost of the switch.		Decora used to be the leader in the category, but now they are selling high priced junk.		DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, they have massive quality control problems. The switches in my older homes have worked for 30-60 years. 20% of my Decora switches have failed in 2-4 years. That's a big problem from the premium priced manufacturer of electrical switches.
1,I have had this installed in a new bathroom for 9 months and want to tear it out everytime I use it!	- It leaks.	- The pressure isn't enough to effectively use the outer ring of the shower head even when I had brand new higher capacity plumbing installed.	- It's not intuitive how to place the handshower back in the ring.	- The pressure and hot/cold move together and it's nearly impossible to figure out which way to turn it for hot/cold.  Guests are never able to figure it out.
1,Very weak construction for a set of pliers. Used this to grab a lock ring and it bent the tips of the tool.
1,I tried to change out the standard light in my mini maglite and the prong from the Nite Ize kit broke off inside the housing. Now I'm out the money for the "upgrade kit" and for the mimi maglite. Put your money towards a new flash light instead of wasting it on this product!!!!
1,The one I received went straight into the garbage. The wheel on the pully wouldn't even spin. Went down to lowes and got one that worked great.
1,When we got this it worked fine. We were able to flip the handle up for long fills, such as stock pots, and do something else while they filled. Then it started snapping back down and would not stay turned on. So now we have to stand at the sink and hold it in the up position until we are through. There seems to be no way to adjust it.
1,The quality was not exactly what I was hoping for with this product.  It was basically just printed on to clear contact paper
1,It was a novel thought but poorly constructed. The edges wrap up the side and leave an edge on the top to collect dust and water making for a mess on top of the shower head.  The LED's have mostly quit working in the blue and green modes. Not worth the price.
1,After 2 weeks for these lights to arrive from China, my first one came smashed because they did not pack it very good for such a long trip over the Atlantic. I had to take a picture of it and emailed it to the supplier and they are working on giving me a credit.
1,Did not hold up to this past winter's weather. Quite a few snapped
1,Crap, lasted about 2 weeks.  Returned the ones I could return.  If you buy these early for a project at a later date, better plug them in and make sure they work for awhile
1,These are much too flimsy to guide down a drain. I am very disappointed in this product. I will go back and order the other hair cleaner product that I had previously purchased. I tried 3 different drains, and it is like pushing a wet noodle.
1,Great price but very flimsy. The metal is bendable...	Was afraid to use as I'm sure they wouldn't stand up to  kids rough handling!
1,disappointing.  I bought Knipex because its supposed to be one of the best pliers brand.  On my first use, I used the tip to pull on a loose drywall screw from a 2x4, the tip got chewed up from the screw threads.  Really? These jaws are supposed to be hardened steel, how can my loose grip on the tool chew up the jaws?? The jaws on this thing is SOFT unless i got a really defective model.  My 20 year old no-brand pliers holds up better to usage. The jaw tip also has a ~5-10 sheets of paper gap (0.025" or so) - not so great when you're trying to grab thin sheet metal.		Further, I emailed Knipex about my issue and they gave me a very cookie cutter email reply.  I will update this if they honor their warranty and treat it as a defective tool.
1,Needs more development, sensor isn't sensitive or accurate, door says it sopen when its actually closed
1,Well, Obviously either these people are extremely lucky and have 100% accurate squares or they didn't bother measure against engineering squares and digital angle gauges. This thing is so off its not usable at all. Super idea and magnets work great too bad it is way off by few degrees. Dont take my word for it. If you going to buy one at store, take an engineering square or digital angle gauges with you  or if you order on line make sure you test it. After all what good is a square that is not square. 2 star i like the idea but that's all.
1,Bulbs look nice and no problem with breakage, but only first 1/3rd of the total coil lights up.  So, even though they're the size of 100 watt bulbs of other brands, the light output is much lower.  They're rated at 23 watts, and they may be equivalent to a 23 watt incandescent bulb, but what's the point of having the larger coil if only 1/3rd of it lights??
1,A very cheap product.  One week and the arm has already broken, ONE WEEK and hardly used.  Also, when this item was advertised, the heading was written as "Sconces" and the picture reveals TWO and it was written , plurally :  SCONCES. I was SO dissappointed when they....I mean...IT arrived.	These are junk. They look nice in the picture but these are not of any quality and for the price?  Look elsewhere.	ALSO: these are tiny candleabra bulbs, yes, the tiny ones, again, VERY misleading.	When searching for future products, I will make sure I do not choose anything from this company; just an overall bad experience.
1,Same story as the rest, Velcro sucks, wears out after a month or 2.  Lost my Skeletool twice, but luckily found both times.  Replacing my second one, hoping to have better luck with the Molle version.		A quick addition to my review, but it appears the 5 star reviews are largely before 2014.  Clearly they must have went with a cheaper lower quality manufacturing process.  So sad for a supposed Made in USA company.  Surely they are outsourcing the nylon and Velcro to save costs.  This "newer" version is pure junk!
1,6/18/16	This tool seems well made. The fit and finish look good. All tools except the pliers and wire cutters are accessible when it is closed.		The flashlight is tiny and probably best used in emergencies.		The clip blade is small and didn't come sharp but was sharpened easily.		The can opener is, as in most cases a joke, good for opening bottles.		The Phillips screwdriver is an actual honest-to-god 3D Philips driver. The problem is, that it is a number 1 or smaller, too big for eyeglasses too small for most other applications.		The serrated blade is more of a saw than a knife, but came very sharp. It has a flat end for medium flat blade screws.		The pliers are nice, with all the tools tucked up inside you can get a very good grip.		None of these tools were meant for heavy use and the tool is a bit heavy for a keychain. Also, after 2 days the paint is already rubbing off the handles. This would not affect the efficacy of any of the tools.		Not a bad deal for the price.		Update - 10/4/16		Within two weeks of receipt from Amazon, the flashlight started acting up. Too heavy for my keychain I suspended it with a bead-chain to my pocket by itself. Then the spring for the tools fell off, also making it difficult to open or close the pliers.  I'm sending it in for replacement. More info as things are resolved...		10/20/16	Sent to Swiss+Tech for replacement. In less than a week the replacement arrived. Bravo Swiss+Tech customer service!		That being said, I now have a brand new tool that I dare not use. It's just poor design. The spring behind the tools may drop out at any time. This is not dangerous, it only makes it difficult to deploy the pliers.		 You can' t expect a headless 6mm rivet to hold for long in any substrate only 2mm thick.		Swiss+Tech people - peen/set those spring/rivets or increase the thickness of the handle material.		One last thing -  I care little how a tool looks, if it works.  Wear is a sign of use . Maroon paint chips on my hands is not wear.
1,Again, second solar product that after a full sunny day charge, at night the lights only last 2 hours, never again.
1,Doesn't fit my Bosch 4100 table saw. Too short to fill opening.
1,This handle is made of folded sheet metal. That means there is an open seam on the back which makes the back very rough.  Also, I intended these for pulling a rather heavy load. I may not be able to use them for that as they may not be strong enough.  I will keep them because they were very low cost and I will find another use for them (after they lay in the parts bin for a few years).
1,It only goes from slightly dim to bright, and no off.  Not very useful, and yes, I'm using a dimmable bulb.
1,Bought this for a kohler toilet. Flap doesn't always fall over the hole perfectly and the toilet runs worse than before. Going to try another brand.
1,We had our previous stainless steel sink for 14 years, and it was never as easy to scratch as this one.  I don't even know of what could have caused it, as I am already seeing scratches to the interior bowl, despite having barely used it.  With this nice satin finish, the scratches show up as shiny lines.  My previous sink had a much duller sinish, so maybe that's why I wasn't used to noticing scratches on that one so much.  I was reluctant to purchase this brand, having seen another sink of theirs receiving a review about the interior bowl scratching with just the strainer tray moving around in it.  When I saw all the positive reviews about this particular sink, I thought it wouldn't be prone to that.  I was wrong and I'm disappointed.		Positives are it is a very thick gauge steel, with a heavy undercoating.  I also like the deep basin and very large and deep drain provided with it.  Make sure you are aware you may have to modify your drain pipe to fit both the depth of the sink and the deep drain.  Our plumber said he hadn't seen a drain so deep before.  We had new plumbing installed, so it wasn't an issue.  One other thing I didn't care for was the brand name printed on the sink.  We have so many brand names prominent on things in the kitchen, I could have done without one in the sink.  However, the good thing is due to the drain being perfectly centered in this sink, you can just turn the sink around so the logo is on the inner side that you won't see unless you lean over it.
1,Light worked for one night.  The next day in the direct sunlight of Florida it would not charge.  It was sent back.
1,One worked great but the other three did not, had to return them.
1,Bad description. They wasted my time
1,cheap
1,They break quickly at the spot welds.  So, do not try to apply any pressure to them as you are using them. I mean you can break on in like a minute if you apply any force to it.
1,This knife has some hard plastic coating that starts wearing and chipping off, causing streaks in your joint compound.  (See attached photo).  I tried peeling it off, but it's stuck on pretty hard, like it's meant to be there.  It's on both sides of the knife.  This product may be OK for spreading frosting on a cake, but not good enough for the job it's designed for.
1,Too bulky and heavy; better save your $ and buy something of a better quality
1,Died after 2 months, light works ok
1,Great idea but very poorly executed. Light is very blue and weak. Took most LED makers a long time to realize that people want warm light like the old school incandescent... Can't recommend.
1,Doesnt give off much black light.  The LED black lights performing 10x better than this one.
1,finish is very rough. poor fit
1,Started going off in the middle of the night after just 4 years.
1,Multiple of the bits (2 smallest for sure) came with a slanted tip as in it slants in one direction and the tip wobbles and you cant get a centered hole. Some of the larger bits SEEM ok but they don't seem to drill even with decent force in plastic. I'm afraid if I push harder I will break it off in my finger. Also the vise part is uneven and cant hold the small bits in the center, they are off to the side slightly. Maybe that's to compensate for the crappy bits?
1,Update: (7/25/2017) Shower wand has started leaking and gets all over the floor as it runs down the cord. Contacted support by haven't heard back.	Update(1/30/2017): changing review from 2 to 3 stars. Customer support contacted me to see what they needed to do fix my issue. They sent a new part with instructions that we were able to reinstall it ourselves in a few hours.  The new fixture worked.  Would be 5 stars if it worked this good when initially installed since we payed a plumber. Would recommend this product, just for the fact cs has been very attentive.		Love the look...but. The hot water comes out in a small stream.  The water is luke warm as well, it doesn't get hot. The hot water in the sink gets very hot so something is wrong with the hot water in this faucet.
1,Use I can give better star rating but replace the bulb from the original maglite. It's kinda same.
1,Makes no sense. You can buy a new mini-mag pro LED at Walmart for $25. Why drop this much on an old flashlight? The standard mini-mag is $9 at Walmart. Buy a new standard plus this and you could have bought the pro model with greater brightness, OEM fit. As a side note I bought the competeing LED for an old moni-mag I had. It worked for a while but the friction of turning the lens (for focus & on/off) eventually broke the solder joints on the PC board of the LED. If I had bought the pro LED mini-mag back then I'd still have it, enjoying it and saved money. Wisdom, take it or leave it.
1,Power connection is loose.  Keystone jacks mounted unattractively.  Fit is tight into high/low voltage box
1,Ball tip broke off during first use. If I could return this item I would.
1,Like other posters have said, the hinge top is weak. I bought 2 of these and both have broken. They need to be made from something stronger than the cheap plastic used. Metal legs are great, unfortunately I can't use the leg extensions because the bottom tray is so narrow the sawhorses are tippy, even before being extended. Great idea for some potentially good sawhorses but the design needs to be rethought.
1,It did not work with my garage door I returned it.
1,The filter works fine as far as filters go, in fact it's great. So great that I have purchased 6 of them over the course of a few years. Not to give them to family or friends nor because of some financial boon that allowed me to purchase a home with seven kitchens. No the reason, dear reader, is simple; See that little black tab in the picture? The one that is the crux of the functionality of the device? Well let me tell you all about that little tab.		That guy will be your new bestie for the first few months, easily actuating between the two flow options and diligently delivering either filtered or unfiltered water as requested. However, after a while you'll notice your friend will start to resist your suggestion to go one way or another and one day, when you least expect it, your old friend will become your new worst enemy and snap like the cheap plastic twig that it is. Leaving you stuck on either filtered or unfiltered or perhaps worse, that despicable purgatory in between giving you a little, but not enough, of each.		My point? Sure, buy it for it's cheap replacement filters, slick design, and ease of use. Just remember once the plastic has had enough you'll have to buy it again and again....
1,This is a Really crapy cheap faucet.  You get what you pay for !!!  DO NOT BUY will not hold up under normal use.  Arm that holds sprayer is loose and wobbly and does not stay tight. Cheap threads an plastic strip quickly.  small plastic button emblem on front of small faucet knob fell off and would not stay tight.  Leaked at sprayer coupling soon after install and use for short time.  Do yourself a favor stick to American Standard, Delta or Kohler and you will get what you pay for.  I am so sorry I purchased this.  It looked sunning in the box and looked great installed but it performed horrible after only a few weeks.  The greatest insult was the sprayer black plastic nozzle cracked and fell out and made a mess trying to use sprayer thereafter.  I purchased a new American Standard unit similar and payed $129 and it works flawless.  I removed this piece of crap and threw it away.  I would not even give it away free to someone because it is such a piece of junk.  Regret my purchase and experience with this poorly made product.  Buyer beware on this one.
1,Chain came loose from the stopper and not able to reinstall. Had to replace it with another stopper from Home Depot.
1,I just had wood floors installed and wanted to give these a try. These pads just don't have enough cushion or softness to them. They are hard and flat. They're almost abrasive. I found some better ones and I'm currently using those.
1,just opened the package today and the switch is malfunctioning. Being that i work with electronics professionally i decided i would just fix the switch vs trying to get a product replacement over it. As i suspected it was a loose wire however because of the way the switch itself is constructed you cant really just take it apart. it ends up just getting destroyed. so now i get the pleasure of going and buying a new switch so that i can splice it in and use this product.		Another note, it emits a fairly yellowish color vs the typical 6500k color range you expect out of led's.
1,The V pattern rubber strip did not fit the  door bottom molding . It was not wide enough to fit in factory track molding !
1,This was the suggested tool for installing central vac pipe but it's the same width as the wall- bad suggestion
1,I used to buy these and they would never last that long when cutting thru welds. Now I use these bi-metal blades "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010BOLYP4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1" and am still on my first one!
1,Screw keeps coming off.
1,Hard to use with one hand. Too big for my pocket and just not the pocket knife I expected. This is what happens sometimes when ordering online.
1,The fan installs easily enough and runs quietly enough, but the flaw is that it doesn't work. Oh, it exhausts, but the ridge vent acts as the air intake when the power fan is on. As a result, only the ridge has air circulating, so the attic remains hot (or humid) and the fan stays on forever.
1,This is a nice pocket multi-tool with a pliers, tiny scissors, small screwdrivers, etc etc.. all the things you might need to rebuild civilization after global warming wipes it out. All the pieces are nicely machined and finished, smooth and sharp. Pretty well made. And it sells for about the price of a six pack of microbrew! Miracle. However, it bothered me that the design is an obvious ripoff of pocket multi-tool designs pioneered by Leatherman and others, American entrepreneurs, designers and mechanical engineers who conceived a new family of tools and worked hard to make them available. I'm willing to pay a little more to support the inventors and not offshore factories who copy and reproduce their designs with cheap labor.
1,This seems like a good idea, and the one I got appears to be well made.  However, it doesn't work with an American Standard Quick Connect drain assembly.  The QC has a plastic sleeve that sits inside the drain, and this stopper is too wide to fit inside it.
1,Brighter than 20w incandescent it replaced.  Cannot speak to longevity as I just installed it, but I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  Appears to be well built, pins fit perfectly and were sturdy.  Shipping took a long time.  Ordered September 20, delivered November 5th.		Update..... Will not be buying again.....very very short life span.  Went through a box of 10 in about 6 months
1,What a piece of junk! Started leaking around the dial after 9 months of use. Lost all pressure. Waste of money.
1,This is not a 3/8" crown stapler. If you want to fasten wood to wood this is not the tool you want. This is a very nice T50 stapler, but I will return it.
1,one came scratched and used and will turn on when it feels like it. seems to be cheaply made. returned them immediately after installing.
1,I've had a 6 pack of these bulbs now for about a year. At first I thought they were really great and produced equivalent light to an incandescent bulb. But after about 10 months the problems started. 2 bulbs in my ceiling fan started to pulse (go dim and brighten rapidly). Then one in my bathroom started to just not power on at all then randomly come on and go back off later. That's 3 failures out of 6 in less than a year on a product that has a main selling point of long life. Don't waste your money on these generic bulbs!
1,Pro: 1 It is a nice little toy flashlight	  2 The plug can be retracted.		Con: 1 Not bright enough to be used for anything more than a foot away.	  2 The night light is just as bright as the flashlight just defused more.	  3 It has a polarized plug,	  4 When plugged in it covers both outlets.	  5 When plugged in the night light points up
1,Update:  11-30-2016	So now it's Christmas...  And the light is sooo dim.  The LEDs flicker and it let's water in...		Ok.  So I put these in the yard on Thanksgiving day.  Plugged them in.  Christmas lights in 15 seconds.  I noticed they were not that bright, but whatever.  Then my neighbor put up his laser Christmas lights from Target.  Whoa.  Mine ARE dim.		Then it rained.  Now they flicker.  There is water behind the glass.  They have been in the yard less than a week.  Boo.  I should have gone to Target.  Count me disappointed.		______________________________________________________________________________________________________	Here is what I used to think, when I was younger in September 2016...		Christmas Lights in 15 seconds.		So my kid has been asking for one of these for a while now.  I've thought about putting lights up on the house, but with a metal roof, I really don't want to get up there an pull a Clark W. Griswold into my front bushes.		I bought two.  They cover the front of the house without any issue.  I think one would be fine, in hind sight.  The light is bright.  It can be switched from red to green to both.  The lights will flash, but I'm not sure I could take this.  We don't have any immediate neighbors behind us, or that might prove to be an issue as the light does carry over the house and lights up the trees behind, but since we don't, it looks cool.		As full disclosure, they lights have been run a total of 30 min.  I'll update after this holiday season!		Good Luck!
1,Too weak a light source to do much - can even imagine if I put them as high up as a gutter...
1,Will not last long if used outside.  Not very weather resistant.
1,Is missing the chrome washer that fits on the outside.
1,I was looking for a standalone Z-wave motion sensor to be used indoors for my home and I came upon this product.  From what I've read from other reviewers, this product DOES work with Vera3, but being a VeraLite owner, I've had issues with this product.  Let's go into the cons:	1) Build:  the product is made of cheap plastic, and to open the cover, you need to jam a tiny screwdriver and use a great deal of force to lift off the cover, nearly breaking the plastic tab in the process.  Why the manufacturer didn't use screws boggles my mind, and when you need to remove the cover to "wake up" the device (due to it being battery operated), repeating this process many times is not only cumbersome but extremely annoying.	2) The device options are not listed on Schlage's website, nor in the instructions, so custom variable settings is either a) not possible or b) a guessing game.  So for example, you would think that when motion is detected, the unit will report back, "Tripped", and after a few seconds, go back to "Untripped", right? Wrong.  The second signal does not go back to VeraLite, which will leave the console / scene to believe that the sensors is constantly "Tripped" when it really isn't.  Only after the device is re-polled does the status go back to "Untripped".  This defeats the purpose of using this unit for scene triggers.	3) Price.  For a standalone Z-wave motion sensing unit, this product is overly priced	4) Size.  This unit is actually quite large and again I'm puzzled why manufacturers can't decrease the size of these units considering the motion sensor itself (with the cover off) is 1/8" square.		Pros:	1) None.
1,Kind of misleading in terms of size and layout. The previous wall words we've purchased were laid out perfectly, in order, and the size seemed similar to how they were represented in their promotional images. This one, however, was a bit off. Well, WAY off. First of all, the words must be cut out manually, and there's very little room for error. If you're not a professional, you'll end up with amateurish kerning (spacing) errors between words which look completely amateur and unacceptable if you're a stickler (like me). You can see examples of this in some of the pictures under some of these reviews - where there are awkward spaces between words. Secondly, the table in the product photo must be located in the home of Oompa Loompas, because these words are no way as large as they look. My iPhone 5c is on the right side of the image, so you can get an idea of the real size of this thing. The packaging was soft and rolled up, with no cardboard protection, so your decal will be kind of crinkled by the time it arrives to you from somewhere in China. There were no creases we couldn't overcome, but we hoped it would be better protected. Overall, if you have serious artistic skills, and if the size difference works for you, you can probably make this look swell in your home. At least everything was spelled correctly.
1,Didn't work for our door. Had to return
1,We had this mailbox for about 1.5 years and the black paint on the aluminum has started to peel everywhere.  It is so cheap looking.  Add to the fact that the mail gets soaked during thunderstorms, the key gets harder and harder to use, and the entire post is thin, weak and fell apart after one tap of the lawnmower equals a not so happy family.  I thought it would be great because of the locked box but please look elsewhere.
1,Crimp tool is stiff need to use two hands to spread jaws... maybe it will loosen with use, I hope. Grips and not molded to tool and slide when crimping. another disappointment.
1,Wouldn't hold a charge
1,When I opened the package, there was no seal on the jar, and a runny black liquid spilled on me.  It looks as though while sitting in packaging, the contents of the wire glue heavily separate. Creating a thick layer on the bottom covered by a thin black watery surface.  With some mixing I find that the consistency does thicken a little, but is still very watery.		I applied a small amount of this stuff to the surface of a PWB, and measured it right away, which measured nothing.  In the liquid state, it has almost no conductive attributes.  As it started to dry is when I started to notice some conducting.  When it was partially dried I was able to get a measurement of 10k-100k.  As the material dried, the resistance seemed to come down.  When the material seemed fully dried, I measured an average resistance across of approximately 1k-2k ohms.  If I bring the probes as close together as I can on the medium, I can get the resistance down to about 300-500 ohms.		I thought to myself, ok, well maybe this manufacturer is expecting the 2 contacts to be physically close.  Which would minimize the material between, and intern reduce the resistance lower than what I am measuring on the surface.  So I tried this, I used the wire glue to bond a wire to a piece of copper, and measured the resistance between.  But still ended up with very high resistances.		I bought this stuff for a personal project, but was hoping it would have worked well so I would bring it into a professional setting where we have need for such an affordable product.  I was hoping that the problems I was having were related to distributor, but I contacted the manufacturer directly, and he sent me a replacement because I was unhappy, but the replacement was exactly the same.		This resistance is too high, and would not be a good candidate for interconnecting solar cells (the reason I purchased).  Putting resistance like this between solar cells would prevent the current from flowing properly, even though your website lists solar cell leads a potential application.		This is being sold as a replacement for soldering, but it really only useful for making SIGNAL connections only.  Signals could probably pass through this resistance without a significant impact on the circuit.  But when soldering, the resistance should be 0 ohms.  That makes this product mis-leading, and pretty disappointing.
1,These two work ok, relatively bright for the size and price but don't expect the entire back yard to be bright.. It is pretty spotty.	I almost gave it 4 stars but then I ordered another one that worked well for a couple of weeks but after a rainy week, the third item stopped working properly - The light turns on immediately after motion stops while the other two have a delay, as should be.	So reliability in the rain seems to be an issue	January 14th 2017:	Brought it down from 3 to 2 starts. A second unit out of 3 went dead, I am assuming it's because of the rain.	As long as the last out of 3 units is still functioning, I will keep this 2 star rating
1,The magnets are too small and weak to stay on a wall vent. They just slowly slide off onto the floor.
1,Switch didn't work - always stays on.  I see this in a lot of reviews. You would think they can test them.
1,They have started rusting!
1,Terrible support, terrible connectivity over zigbee. Terrible hub and terrible mobile apps. However, if you hook up some 3rd party software integration to SmartThings and if you can over come the terribly unreliably connectivity, then it can work.....sometimes.
1,I though it was bright, then my buddy walked up with his Costco buy and put this one to shame.
1,This was the fourth high end Ingersoll Rand tool that I have bought that was either dead on arrival or dead shortly after putting to use. You could call it bad luck but that is not the case here. I am a professional and I grease my air tools regularly and also oil them before and after use. Being a professional tech means that my tools must be reliable on a day to day basis and I just don't feel that Ingersoll Rand is producing the same tools that I once took so much pride in owning. I will no longer purchase any pneumatic tools from Ingersoll Rand unless at some point the quality of there tools/customer service improves. You could take your chances on this one but if your interested in the hammer your most likely looking for high quality, if that is the case I suggest you look at some other options i.e. Bluepoint, Snap On, Matco, Aircat.
1,I bought 2 extra sets of these with the idea i could mount all my table top tools to it and make them modular. They only fit the miter saw (as the name suggests). The larger, longer brackets that fit the table saw are not sold separately - that i could find.  So as of now they look really nice under my bench, other than that i can't use them on anything but a miter saw and i don't have 3 miter saws.
1,Hard surface on front make it uncomfortable and even dangerous on smooth and semi-smooth surfaces
1,I really like the concept of this, however the execution is lackluster. The chuck just never holds the bit securely.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I can never get it to lock tightly which means the bit falls out or slips. Today I actually used the drills and countersink bits from this kit but stuck them directly in my drill. When I drove the screws, I used a blue "Click-Change" chuck that is much much more pleasant to use.
1,Looks great, but won't last.  I ordered 3 packs, Ive had 7 of them quit working in fixtures we use routinely.  They start out with a seizure inducing flicker, then within a few days they stop working entirely.  I am looking for an alternative now.		Update:  I am at 60% failure rate at this point.  They just keep dropping out like flies.  Obviously the manufacturer is just trying to toss together garbage from unreliable material that will illuminate out of the box, but with no concern or actual guarantee of longevity.  DO NOT BUY THESE!  KEEP LOOKING!  Or, toss some extra money in the garbage with the bulbs after you get them.		Update: September 2018.  The last one just failed, so thats 100% failure within 16 months. None of the fixtures they were used in are used very often.  Total garbage.  Should be illegal to sell this junk.
1,Button is inconsistent with past versions
1,not worth trying unless you have a 400 pound gorrila trained to operate.  can't believe they would make something like this. it's going back.  bought the 9 inch exchange a blade it works perfectly. the PL-215 is going back as soon as i get it packaged.
1,I bought this remote to control my outdoor Christmas lights. I tested it in my house when it first arrived. It worked fine. But after installing it on my deck, it stopped working after about 10 minutes. It does not like to operate in the cold weather. When I brought it back indoors, it worked again after it warmed up. Amazon sent me a replacement for it, but that one also did not work after being exposed to the cold. I am not talking about severe cold (e.g. below zero). Both remotes stopped functioning in 28F weather. I finally bought a similar product from my local Ace hardware store, and it has worked flawlessly.
1,The scoring tip broke with it's first use.
1,Product was installed but didn't work (heat on all the time regardless of setting.)  After 45 minutes with tech support they suggested returning it for another one.  I returned it, but lost confidence in the product and put the old one back.
1,Had one bulb malfunction already. Disappointed
1,This is a little screwdriver that works well to drive a few screws, but has limited use in my shop for large projects.  Great for those time when you have a dozen screws to remove.  The locking mechanism broke the first day, so the screwdriver can not be used manually.
1,cheap chinese plastic .
1,Powerful. You have to be strong and skilled to use this tool. It's no joke.
1,Cheap!
1,I originally bought this for over garage doors, but once it came I decided to place it above a patio door in the back of my house. It is is smaller in design than most flood lights, and the bulbs can never be changed, so you will have to get a new fixture at some point. Granted it has a long life span with LEDs, and changing bulbs isn't any fun either.		These LEDs shine an almost flourescent color but very bright...white light...not the normal more yellowish color of standard halogen floods. It is not a warm color...and it did a great job scanning for motion and turning on only at night when motion is detected when purchased. It covers my patio and a good portion of my yard. I do have an overhang over it where it is located, so it is somewhat protected.		I gave it a five star rating, ( SEE UPDATED REVIEW AT BOTTOM) , since it was all that was promised, but I would not get another one, unless this lasts a very long time...and I am still living in this house.  It is not permanent with no way to change bulbs, but then again, my other motion detector light didn't last long at all...yet that one was cheap. This one was pricey, and it is a smaller footprint on the house.		I bought another type of motion floodlight for over my garage and that one is working great. It is much larger and heavier and has halogen bulbs and covers more distance...my entire long driveway. It survived hurricane Sandy a week after it was put on and was facing the worst of the wind here at the Jersey shore. (So did this Lithonia light...still there...working just fine...under an bit of an overhang.)		***** UPDATE.  It is just two years later and this light stays on constantly and will not turn off unless I flip the switch totally off.  It is no longer sensing and turning on...just on all the time. I reduced my rating to two stars.  So, I have to keep it off and will be replacing it with a different fixture.  Do not waste your money.
1,The face shield cracked after the 1st use!
1,bought 2,1 arrived paced well 1 broken, 1 had screws holding it together,1 had nothing
1,A perfect solution but the size was not accurate - they were too big.
1,I was sent these 25W bulbs by mistake. I ordered the 15W bulbs precisely because of the reviews I read here that stated these gave off noxious odors. Indeed they do! I tested one and it's wasn't on more than 60 seconds before the fumes were overwhelming. My throat still hurts from whatever they emitted. So I will add my review and caution folks just as a couple other reviewers have done. Thank you by the way, for that head's up.
1,Great idea, but doesn't stick well to key. Lost both of them within a month.
1,Not happy with these.  Buyer beware: the 4000 kelvin "nature white" is extremely stark white -- far whiter than a conventional GE "soft-white" bulb.  Whiter than the polar ice caps.  I can't imagine what 5000 kelvin (also offered) would be like.  Maybe good for a prison break, but not for a home.  Also, "25 watt equivalent" is questionable -- they're significantly brighter than a 25-watt incandescent bulb.  Now, if you view that as an advantage, great -- otherwise it's just too damn bright, and doesn't meet the need.		I like the idea of saving electricity, and I don't doubt the long life.  But if you're replacing "equivalent" incandescents, be prepared for a shock.
1,Dont waste your money!
1,It does not sit properly on a carpeted floor as the bast wobbles very easily. Also, then putting together the smaller lamp and trying to twist the bottom on, it very easily breaks. I partially broke two of them while just trying to screw the top onto the bast. Honestly, this thing is pretty much a piece of garbage. I am very dissatisfied with my purchase.
1,Possible dangerous consequences for trying to shove wires through a thin tube.  The cover on the wires comes off and the wires are exposed.  This product should be taken out of the inventory
1,I did install this and it seems to work OK so far, a bit loud but that doesn't bother me. Main thing that comes to mind when looking at this fan unit is "cheap" - I bet design goal for it was to cut costs as much as possible so metal it's made of is extremely thin and flimsy, 3 times thinner than old unit I replaced, about as thick as a cheap beer can.		Recurring theme seems to be "what can we nickel and dime customer on" - duct attachment part is so flimsy it flops around, has to use 2 screws to tighten (screws were not included). Cable clamps (3/8 which you'll need 3 of) are not included. Wire nuts to connect wiring are not included. There is nothing "deluxe" about this "Deluxe" fan.		Switches are included and the cheapest kind, I'd prefer that they don't include the switches but improve build quality instead.		I will not buy another Air King fan in the future. Very disappointed considering this is not the cheapest model out there. I used allen+roth unit in another bathroom and that one is of much better quality,maybe I'll stick with that one for next project.
1,This was pretty much a bust.  Of the five regulators, All five worked fine for 3.3v  But wait! There's less!  None worked properly for 5 volts.  Three metered at 4.2 to 4.5. One metered at the line voltage (9v) and one metered at 6 volts.  These are useless for micro controllers unless you don't care if the problem you are encountering is because of low voltage or your circuit.  I can not figure out how this got any good reviews unless the previous reviewers only worked with 3.3v or never broke out he multimeter.  Spend more.
1,Changed my review from a 5-star to a 2-star because if I lose electrical power the lamp icon displays "Offline" in both the Tuya Smart and Alexa Apps. After trying several things, the only way I can get the light back "Online" is to turn off then turn on my iPhone. My other Smart Devices, such as the thermostat, smart wall switches and smart outlets automatically reset and reconnects to both Tuya Smart and Alexa Apps, this device doesn't.		 Love this bulb when used with my Alexa devices. At first neither of us liked the bright white light output but we fine-tuned it to a warm white and like it. Also now my wife can turn on the light upstairs via Alexa while downstairs and when she's get to the upstairs bedroom, command the downstairs light to turn off. No more stumbling in the dark or yelling for me to come out of the computer room to turn on the hallway light. This bulb saved our marriage!
1,Bought this from Home Depot.  It lasted under three months with average use.  Just wanted to add to the list and urge better quality control from Cree :)
1,light use may be total active time less than a hour, dead.	I bought two guns $260 or so, N62FN and SB-2IN1, I repaied N62FN two times myself, now SB-2IN1 no brad come out.	I also bought hitachi 3-1/4 nailer and senco roof brad nailer, both are very old worn a lot, no label can be seen, yet they work better!
1,While seeming well built, this item pales in comparison to Leatherman and  Victorinox product. The unit jams consistently and the scisors broke almost immediately.  I would avoid this product.
1,It took maybe 1 or 2 minutes of use for most of the brass wires to be scattered everywhere. Thank goodness for eyewear and a shopvac
1,bits all lose their shape too quickly. Purchased a box of same in red case and they were much better
1,Just bought and installed these. Neither works. Checked voltage at the transformer and end of line. 12.2 volts. Need to return I guess.
1,This thing sucks.  It's made of plastic.  The code system is also stupid because the numbers don't have to be entered sequentially.  The manual recommends that you enter at least 7 numbers in your code, but this is actually quite stupid.  Since the numbers don't have to be entered sequentially, and you can only enter a number 1x, a 7 (or more) digit code actually makes it EASIER for someone to enter a random code and break into the keybox.  What a P.O.S.
1,Wooden platform WILL DEGRADE immediately if exposed to even small amounts of rain.  Am going to replace that component, and replace it with "marine" plywood.
1,Bought a return (claimed unused) based on price. Was obviously used, pipe thread was left on inputs/outputs, otherwise as described. Leaked internally. Returned, trying a new one.  Internal leaks seem to be an issue, I am giving it one more try since the waterlines are now plumbed.	Edit 11/4 - it worked more or less ok for a week.  Then it just stopped.  No change in water pressure, no internal leaks, we tested the incoming power with a meter, the circuit had a new breaker installed before we put the new one in - everything should have been fine.  I'm going to keep this at one star; shame because it fit in the tight spot fairly well.  I'd suggest against this unit.
1,Grrr...driver mechanism stopped worked after sheathing first floor of my new house. Just past 90 day return and forced to convey to DeWalt to benefit from the warranty. I live in the San Juan Islands so need to send in the entire nailer - at my own cost - for repair. Not only does it cost me money but it delays my project. Irritating experience. While working it was great for sheathing, mediocre to lousy when framing Doug-Fir.		I've never enjoyed DeWalt tools and bought this one based on the positive reviews. I do not recommend the tool or DeWalt, which offers lousy servicing.
1,Buyer beware. OttLite's warranty is only 1 year and you had to of bought the bulb directly from them and not a retail store in order for their warranty to apply. If you bought their light bulbs from a retailer, which is where I bought mine, it is up to the retailer to replace the bulb which retailers only offer a 30 - 90 day warranty depending on the store. Other light bulb companies that I have dealt with cover 8+ years of warranty and they don't mind where you purchased the bulb as long as its theirs.		I will not be purchasing anymore bulbs from OttLite.
1,Expected it to be a darker bronze, but was too light.  Returned it because it didn't match the rest of the hardware.
1,It would be one thing if this stuff was cheap and they were honest about how hard it is to hang, but it is expensive and they lie and act like it is easy. Most people will ruin multiple sheets trying to install it multiplying the end expense.		I have the simplest possible install, reasonably sized storm windows that can be taken off and laid on a work bench. I copiously sprayed with application fluid, but this stuff curls up like a boston terrier's tail, the protective film quickly tears off crooked and you have to start it from another corner or worse an edge where the whole sheet tears easily. when squeegeeing it out or cutting the edges it wrinkles like an 80 year old sunbather's face. No matter how clean you try to be you will get grit underneath the film that won't come out despite repeatedly trying. Heck you won't even be able to tell which side of the film its on. And to top it off you'll get almost done and end up tearing it in the middle of the sheet as you are getting the last of the bubbles out.		It is like hanging the most intricately designed and thin paper wallpaper with kid's school paste. I highly recommend just don't do it... Don't waste your money...
1,Everything about these feel cheap.  The handles are a hard (but not dense or sturdy feeling) plastic.  The Phillips head tips appear not to be part of the shaft but sort of welded on.  The chrome finish chips easily, and the metal itself is easily scratched by screws, though all of my drivers are still usable, none have been completely stripped.  The plastic rack they come in is terrible, basically just packaging material with a few extra holes for mounting, but nothing you'd actually want to use to hold the screwdrivers.		That said, they are also actually cheap, so if you just need some screw drivers for occasional use, go for it.  Just don't expect them to last long under heavy use.
1,Bought these to go around the top and sides of our shower, big mistake. I should have stuck with tic tac tiles they look more like real tile than these. On the plus side these go up quickly. But they had a hard time staying stuck to speckled wall area, wallpaper, and even just plain old painted wall area! They were peeling down almost as fast as I would just finish putting one up. I know how to install them- I installed the cristiles around my bathroom sink and it looks fab no problems at all. I installed the tic tac tiles all around my whole kitchen or. Old wallpaper that I didn't even wash and it stuck great no problems and none peeling off after 3weeks of hot humid weather 86 -90 ea day! I like how these look and they are way cheaper but because they are so thin every little bump or tiny lump shows up. So I would only recommend these on a completely flat smooth surface and use extra adhesive. Their glued backing prob wouldn't even stick to a piece of paper-it's THAT bad.
1,Not worth the money nor worth free shipping. Low quality. Bad cutters. Bad metal. Break easily. Junk.	Complete garbage. I am embarrassed that Amazon sells these.
1,I have been happy with many of the items I have purchased from Amazon.com; this purchase was not one of them. I had to buy this item again and again just to try and get four that worked. In some instances the lamps would come on for no reason, and stay on indefinitely. Last night when I went to replace one of the lights - again - that stopped working after two weeks, I found water in the top light part - for me it was the final straw. I believe there are true manufacturing defects with this product that need to be addressed by the manufacturer. Because I bought four, I had spend a fortune on Duracell "C" batteries that now I will never use. I am going to try the "Mr Beams MB572" product which is less expensive, but not as pretty, and hope that works better. Regrettably, there are just not a lot of options out there for motion sensing path lights. I would not recommend purchasing this product.
1,These arrived quickly and look great other than that I am very  Disappointed. They are VERY fragile. You need NO BREEZES in order for these not to fall apart. The images on the add show cardboard of somekind being lit.. all there is to light is a block of wax with no form of a wick.. You literally need a propane torch to ignite the wax if you can ignite it at all.. Spend a few extra bucks and get lanterns that have no negative reviews...
1,Black?!  It was supposed to be black.  Came in white color.		Otherwise, it does the simple task it needs to connect two plugs to a single outlet.
1,I have no idea how anyone could give this poorly designed hunk of junk anything more than zero stars. Everything about it is great except for one single absolutely deal breaking flaw: The water flow jets DO NOT cover the entire bowl! If you like having to wipe the walls of your toilet bowl every time you use it, then this is the toilet for you. If you want a toilet that actually accomplishes the job of being a toilet, then look elsewhere.  Never have I been so utterly disappointed in a product. Not only a waste of money on the toilet, because it's not like you can return it once it's installed, but now I have to pay a second plumber to remove the useless paperweight grouted to my bathroom floor and install another one. Absolutely DISGUSTED at the quality control of American Standard. An absolutely USELESS product. USELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	This complete waste of time and money will end up costing us almost $300 in plumber bills, and that doesn't even include having to buy another toilet. Do not believe all the positive reviews, most of them are bribe vine reviews. So (expletive withheld) furious with American Standard I have no further words. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, THIS IS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,i got these for securing kayaks on my roof. but they are too long and the rachet pinched our hands. they did not work well for this application. i recommend the simple kayak tie down which NOW i am familiar with. these probably work well for other applications. plus if you over rachet they jam up and you have to disassemble the rachet....what a pain! Not worth returning.
1,These were supposed to be closed but 3 out of 4 of mine leaked.  I bought 5 and sent them all back and bought the Coilhouse CH15, which work perfect.
1,Bottom line for this product is that it does not work with heavy shower head assemblies or those with extended arms.  It is a solid diverter and seems well built but the threading is weird.  the standard handshower hose does not have an easy time screwing on and is near impossible to get off. and it wants to rotate if any leverage is put to it.  The shower pipe threaded side fits lose and slips a thread if you over tighten. I have ordered a 1/2 to 3/8 solid brass converter to replace the free spinning garbage it came with.  should solve the problem.
1,TOTAL GARBAGE!!!! I am a contractor, I purchased two of these new for a big roof project. On the first day I used them they jammed all the time! The staples ride up on each other! I never shot a full two racks of staples with out them jamming. Then I dropped one 10 ft off the roof onto the grass and it snapped in half!!!!! There are cheaply constructed, not like most Senco products.	I went to the hardware store and purchased to Hitachai's and had no problems with them.	Dont wast your time or money with these!
1,This brand and this company are horrible. I bought the set in Nov 2014 for $99 on a lightning deal and used it for tiny projects around the house. Then June 2015 I helped on a small porch project and after about 40 screws the impact driver was dead....no life left. The two batteries still worked in the regular driver but the impact is gone. I tried handling the warranty and replacement through email with Rockwells customer service but that was quickly frustrating because they have a template response so the first email said, "did you try the other battery? " then "I hope I resolved you issues please don't hesitate to contact us in the future" WHAT!!? So then I had to start over with a new customer service because it's all the same general email.  Then the next rep said I had to call customer service to.get the re replacement drill. I finally got around to calling and I truly believe I woke up the customer service rep I was speaking to on the phone. He did not speak in a normal volume, there were long pauses of silence and I ended the long pauses with a "hello?" Because I assumed the call had disconnected. Finally I decided I did not have the time to handle this and that in would have to set aside about 2 hours to deal with this DUD of a company to try and get them to back the warranty they seem to brag about. So I will update when I get a response from an alert Rockwell employee. But knowing how this company operates, I want my money back, not a new drill. I will never buy anything this company is involved with again. If I could give it a negative star I would.	But Ryobi if you want a less expensive set, they have great customer service!!
1,hard to use
1,this didn't have the necessary guts inside in order to install so my contractor couldn't use neither of two I had bought.  And I bought the two Moen faucets and adapters back during Christmas time. I only needed one of each and I had ordered two.  Can I still return these?
1,Ripped in first 24 hours. Grommets ripped right out when the wind blew. Going back to the super heavy duty one, which is STILL awesome after over a year.
1,Ordered these on September 10th 2017 and installed 1 right away... Dead on March 7th 2018.
1,One I bought was good not as vibrant. Bought the sand beach one and it was blurry and so hard to out up because I couldn't get all the bubbles out. I tried redpjng it and the. In the process rhe corner got atuck to the back and ruined the whole image. Don't get the sand beach. Waste of money.
1,Fragile and not worth the $60.00 they charge. $40.00 should have been top price. Greedy Greedy POC!
1,Unfortunately I waited too long to install this lock. It's only been in for 3 days. At first the door knob lock worked fine but now the key can just completely spin around and not lock. Piece of junk.
1,failed out of the box
1,PLEASE NOTE! The description says "number of pieces 5" but there is only TWO BAGS. Don't make the same mistake I did. I had to return mine.
1,Cheaply Made and do not hold, Set screw strips out before getting it to hold!
1,This was a packaging error, where the pack of staples was loosely put into a larger box, and bounced around during shipment.  As a result, the Bostitch box broke, and the strips of staples were broken into parts and pieces.  A real pain to use.  The product itself is probably OK, but the total experience is poor.  Worse, I ordered two different sizes, and both boxes of staples rattled around the shipping container, with the same result.		The staples appear OK, but I have not used many yet, and the broken segments appear to impact the smooth feeding of the staples in my staple gun.		Poor experience, and I hope the seller uses something like crumpled paper, rather than a gas filled plastic bag to pack future orders.
1,Not what expected was too large for lamp didn't look how pictures made it to be
1,For what this is, it just underwhelms.  I returned it.
1,Not a high torque motor. Has good torque for turning one wheel to a light RC car but nothing more than that (need a gear box). Unfortunately mine looked damaged when I got it, with dark dents along the outer diameter. Thought it was working fine, but after hooking it up to what I was building it just stopped working. Wasn't even fully in, just the tip was attached so I could test it. After yanking it out I found that it would run for 3 sec and then stop. It was unusable. Hopefully the next motor I get won't fail me.
1,For birch edge bands I'll stay with a utility knife & sanding to get edges with which I'm happy.  Might work on composites??
1,Does not last even for a month.
1,I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this (locally), but unfortunately you can't test these at stores.  My plumber ALSO recommended this one (as apparently many other plumbers have).		We have a standard depth stainless steel sink.  Here are the problems:		1) If remove head to hand wash items, needs to be in exact right position to connect back to base.  Head cord is not flexible so hard to hold head at angle with one hand and dishes with other.		2) The SPRAY function is way too strong... sprays water over windows, me, counters, etc.  If you lower water pressure, it AUTOMATICALLY REVERTS TO STREAM, so there is NO WAY to have spray that doesn't go all over the place.		3) Which leaves the STREAM function for most use.  Even at lower pressure levels, water goes everywhere.		I've had $40 faucets that worked better than this.  After paid plumber for installation, this cost over $600... for a FAUCET THAT DOESN'T WORK!!		Plumber later told me that you need one of the newer DEEPER sinks to avoid the splashing all over.... now he tells me!
1,My J5 Tactical flashlight worked fine at first. I put it in my gun safe with my pistols, for emergency use. I pulled it out today, and it doesn't work! I figured I'd just change the battery, but I CAN'T UNSCREW IT to change the battery. I may have to take it into my shop, put it in a vise, and use a wrench to get it apart. And I'm afraid I might break it -- but, based on the many bad reviews I have read, it won't be a big loss. I have other, more usable, more dependable LED flashlights.		Update -- a few days later.  I took the flashlight into my workshop, placed it in a vise, and used a wrench to try to unscrew the cap to change the battery.  BUT IT WOULD NOT UNSCREW!!!  The wrench and the vise chewed up the aluminum body of the flashlight, but were unable to budge the cap.  I guess I'll just throw this POJ away.  (I guess now I know what the "J" in the model number stands for!)
1,very small and for people will big hands its unusable
1,They slip off from under furniture. If the padding were higher it might grip to the furniture better. maybe it will work better on appliances but I had an supremely heavy item that gave me the problem.
1,There are lot better kits available in local stores.	Quality was not good compared to local ones.
1,I had a lot of boxes I need to move from my attic to my garage and I thought this would be of great use.  Hah!  anything I tried to put on it would fall off.  I also found it was poorly designed to go up and down steps.
1,Absolute junk.  I had 18 2" holes I needed to drill through 1/2" plywood for soffit vents in my shed so I ordered these.  After the first 8, the drill be portion of the holder broke off.  Luckily I had another hole saw bit I was able to use.  Each hole took several minutes.  Like I said previously, this is only 1/2" plywood here and it was miserable to get through.  The 18 holes took over an hr.
1,It will definitely do what it says, but the little clamps to keep things in place are pretty weak; I will likely need pliers to tighten them so it doesn't flop around.
1,After installing them and working out all the wire color differances from the JACKYLED RGB Extension Cable, RGB LED Light Strips 4-Pin Female, I still see they are flickering and seems the color changes all by them selves. I even added a TSSS Data Repeater RGB Signal Amplifier to see if that helps but they still do it. I removed my old lights thinking these would look better but I kind of regret it now.
1,The shower heads are pretty but they are plastic they are not full Chrome
1,Very small inside diameter. Restricts flow too much for my purpose with a 3/4" hose..
1,Not deep enough for my boat lift switches I reordered Bud Industries JBH-4961-KO.
1,Set it up under my dorm bed. I didn't expect much for the price but aside from the harsh color of the light it's really awesome.		Edit: After a bit over a month this light has completely stopped working. The plug jiggles around inside the light and will not turn on. I worked awesome while it lasted but I expected it to last more than a month. Dissapointed
1,Decent tubing if it wasn't so hard to work with!
1,Worked as described but unfortunately after about three weeks it worked itself apart and went into pieces one night when I got out of the vehicle.  Not made very sturdy and since losing most of this item I purchased a nice Pelican L1 I think it is.  Not only is it brighter than the Streamlight but also at least 5x more durable.  (Still love the Streamlight Stingers flashlights though)
1,Do not buy this LED products - low quality, the data dot not match the reality.......one is gone within 2 months, instead of "20 years".....cheap Chinese stuff!
1,This is an ok moving blanket...nothing to write home about.  I bought three, used one, and returned the other two.  It's not worth the money.  Plus, it's only one blanket per package!
1,Extremely distorted sound, most especially on loud setting.  I just did not like the sound tone at all on any setting. CD quality?  Not even remotely close - never heard such a terrible sounding doorbell in my entire life.		So I sent it back for a refund.
1,Didnt notice a difference and these are expensive
1,really small, and you have to continue to hold it for it to light which is difficult considering its size.  Glad I only bought one to try it first before getting more for other stocking stuffer gifts.
1,didn't work as stated
1,This faucet works very well.  It's really a great idea and operates flawlessly. The problem is its appearance.  After a year, it constantly spews corrosion. You can clean it, and just a few days later it looks like crap again.
1,The concept seemed good, but the magnetic switch is hard to activate to turn on. It tried tweaking the arm but it never seemed easy to turn on
1,These gloves are not the real mechanix gloves that they described. The gloves that I got were fake knock off's and were falling apart in the first  hour that I was wearing them as you can see in the pictures. At a closer look at the gloves they don't say Mechanix on the velcro, they actually say Mechamix. Also on the knuckle part of the gloves wear there supposed to say Impact, they actually say Mpact. I would not buy anything from the people who sold these. I am very disappointed that people are actually selling these to people.
1,Perfet item, thank you
1,This is the first SF light I bought in a few years due to price. Although this is the SF budget line the quality is poor. The aluminum body is not made of hard aluminum like most other lights, including the Chinese imports. Threads strip easily if you are not careful. Beam color is yellow green tint and very yellow green on low. Lens is plastic and the tail switch seems cheap and not as robust as my other SF lights. This light cannot compete with the Chinese lights, at least the ones I have for 1/3 the cost. To keep the cost low I am sure they chose a cheap bin from a Chinese supplier of LED assemblies. Parts of this light are imported according to the box, and I assume it is the LED.
1,Giving a one star review because filters, as others have mentioned, do not say Nordic pure anywhere on them. They were still cheaper than most other options so I decided to keep them. Seems sketchy.
1,does not work very well. it does catch anything
1,poor quality
1,major flaw in engineering, to access the scewdrivers etc, you have to open the plier fully and then get them out, who thought of that design?????
1,It was nice while it lasted... which was about 6 months.  My sump pump wells get filled with Iron Ochre, which requires constant cleaning with Iron Out and/or OxyClean, but this pump lasted a lot less time than prior pumps - cheapy plastic pumps.  That followed a Wayne 1/2 HP combo system (main and battery backup) that burnt out in a year in my other well.		I think it's time to move on from Wayne products - might be great if you don't have particles and, in particular, Iron Ochre, in your wells... but if you do, don't waste you time and money.
1,Says it is for the TL series, but should specifically state that it is for not for the TL1.
1,I bought this adapter for an older 3283dvs sander, which originally came with a flimsy bag filter.  I also added a microfilter cartridge.  After sanding a kitchen's worth of cabinets and 8 conference room tables, I don't think the system has collected more than a couple of tablespoons of dust.  Most of it ends up on the outside of the sander or in the air.  Apparently, my sander is just not set up right for the pressurization of the microfilter.	I am a big fan of Bosch tools and believe they are genuinely well-engineered.  But I bought this system on their customer support agent's recommendation and wish I hadn't
1,Product arrived and was different than pictured. The bag was all red and functioned fine.
1,Seemed like a very nice tool until it broke on it's first job.  I tried to get out two phillips screws on a muffler on a rototiller.  Got one out but the handle started spinning on the metal shaft on the second one making the tool useless!
1,Not very durable, mine was a one, and done. not very sharp, teeth broke.
1,This light works fine.  The design is a little dated and it is fairly large for a single AA battery.  My gripe is the fact that the clip is held on with triangular screws (a pain to remove).  Why put a theft resistant screw on a flashlight?  Torx screws seem like a better choice.
1,pure garbage , the switch has a short and will randomly come on which is very dangoures , as soon as its applied to anything it cuts off, the battery charger constantly moves causing the battery to not charge, the battery takes many hours to charge and then it won't even work when you try to cut/sand whatever anything, very underpowered, iv used dremel brand for many years mostly the cordless 8770 modle and it works amazingly tho its more expsnezive , you get what you pay for , if you only wanna spend 20 dollars buy a non cordless one it will have alot more power , i can't believe dremel actually sells this to people, you would think with all the high reviews it would be good and being the brand name but it is certainly not, don't buy this tool
1,This is the buggiest piece of tech I have encountered since CD-R's were first introduced.  I am an electrical engineer who specializes in embedded software and really, there is no excuse for how poorly the software operates - wether it be in the device, or the app required to use the device.  I would love to get a look inside the software for this, as I can only imagine how awful it must be.  When the solution to every problem is to reset the Wemo, forcibly stop the application on your phone, uninstall said application from your phone, and reinstall, YOUR CODE HAS A PROBLEM.  It's like reasoning with a petulant child.  EVERYTHING seems to derail it.  Change the name of your wemo from the app?  FAIL.  Add a second rule to the device?  FAIL.  Connect the device to IFTTT?  FAIL.  Seemingly connect the device FROM the IFTTT website?  FAIL  I fought with this thing to enable remote access.  It looked like it wasn't going to work.  After repeated messages that it was not working, hours later I open the app and remote access is enabled.		I vacillated between giving this review from one to three stars.  It does have a great form factor.  And in it's most fundamental terms, it 'works'.  I can actually remotely turn on and off the thing.  And the rule I created to turn it on works (after much fighting with the device).  The subsequent rule to turn the thing off?  Not so much.  And there is no easy way to change the network settings.  And the settings I can change, any attempt to change them often results in an eternal spinning wheel.  The worst part is, I don't feel I can rely on this device.  The one I have I wanted to use as part of my irrigation system.  But, as of writing this, it only operates as a remote control.
1,At one time I was a finish carpenter and owned professional grade hinge templates that did all hinges at one setting.  Unfortunately, these got damaged and I'm not in the trade anymore so I bought the earlier model just for an occasional job.  The new appears to have the same problems.  Many are listed and all are aggravating and reflect on a poorly designed and constructed product.  Make your own and stay away from this styrene monster.  Mine broke and became useless before I had cut the first hinge.	There are plans on the internet but all you need are a five inch wide piece of ply the length of the door, a couple pieces of scrap wood nailed on one side to accommodate the thickness of the door you are using and a 2-3 duplex 5d nails along and a pair of pan head sheet metal screws.  I'm assuming you have a router with a template bushing already.  Simply mark out the hinge size, adding 1/8" all around and cut it out.  The trick is marking it in place.  Put the top of the top hinge 7" from the top, the bottom of the bottom hinge 11" from the bottom and the other centered between.  The hard part is cutting them out with a saber saw. The scraps nailed on the back align you left and right for the right door thickness.  The duplex nails are pre-drilled and hold the template to the door edge.  The pan head screws go in to the ends of the template.  when you do the jamb, the screw head holds the cut down from the head so you have clearance.  One in both ends of the template for L or R swings.  When you route the door, ignore the screw, holding the top of the door flush to the template. The cutout for the template is the tricky part but once done, you will have a template that will do three hinges with one set.
1,This pack I bought is to add on and replace the identical ones I bought for my home a little over a year ago.  Out of the 3 I had originally purchased, 2 were still decently bright, but one was almost completely dead.  I left them plugged in, in the auto mode, so perhaps the batteries never got a chance to go through their complete cycles.  But these do a great job of being an auto sensing night light (that turn off when the normal lights are on), and are just bright enough to work as emergency power failure lights if the power goes out.  But with 1 of 3 failing after just over a year, I can't give them 5 stars.  After cycling that 3rd light's batteries several times (unplugging it and turning the light on until completely dead, then plugging it back in set for "off"), it works better now, but is still not nearly as bright as when first purchased, and unplugged, the light only lasts a few minutes.  But at the time I got them, they were a great price, and serve their purpose.  All you really need is a couple minutes of light from them so that you can find your normal full-sized flashlight etc.  I rate them a solid 4 stars.		Update: After a year and a half, all six lights I own no longer worked properly.  The lights go out within seconds after losing power (or unplugging them).  They are now just night-lights in various places in my home.  I've lowered the stars to two because they did not last nearly as long as I expected, and if you're only looking for night-lights, there are much cheaper options out there.
1,Didn't fit.
1,When we try to put the key in the door knob it does not go in smoothly at all. We have to gently move the key to get it into the slot. When I have one arm holding a small child it make it extremely difficult to unlock the door. I am disappointed in the product and would have returned it had it not been for the fact that it was purchased a while ago but we had to wait for our new door to be installed with our new door knob set. The deadbolt works fine the problem is just in the knob part and it's a problem with both of the knobs. Would Not recommend.
1,Gaudy, like something out of a Dickens novel.  Nope
1,Does not fit any of my three Surefire 6Ps or one 9P.  Glad I only bought one to try it out instead of wasting my money on four of them.
1,Diaphragm tore after a few months of operation. Too late to return it.
1,Wow great on their own, BUT don't be fooled by the super-misleading "Works with Nest" program.  That program is only for the thermostats.  The Protect doesn't really integrate with ANY monitored home alarm company's system.
1,Missing parts, twice.
1,The product is very nice and works well. Reason for one star is the customer service. I received my package and when I opened it, I was missing the part that joins the lights to the power. Company would not respond to my emails.
1,I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ALARM SYSTEM.  #1: IT DOESN'T BARK.  #2, IT GOES OFF WHEN I WALK ACROSS THE FLOOR UPSTAIRS ABOVE THE DOOR.
1,It's a mockery, the batteries work exactly 45 days, the exact time to lose the right to return them. IS A GOTCHA. MADE IN CHINA
1,Didn't work, had to return it.
1,The light itself is great and very bright, but they tend to burn out often. I have gone through about 3 of them already in a one year period.
1,Purchased a home with aluminum shades. Apparently a previous pet occupant loved barking at kitties through the back French doors. Several lightly bent blades (and one pretty severe) detracted from appearance. This tool was absolutely useless on 1" mini blinds. Read all reviews and watched You Tube videos. Followed advice, but only made problem worse. Threw out shades and bought new.
1,I love the concept of this knife.  The size is just right, it looks cool (although I could do without the asian characters on the handle), and it feels good in the hand.  The opening mechanism works well with practice.  The problem with it is that the tip of the blade isn't covered enough when it's closed in the handle: I managed to accidentally cut my thumb while the knife was closed.  If the blade were just a couple of millimeters shorter it wouldn't be a problem.
1,As another reviewer said, they couldn't even get the size of the nut on the bottom correctly. It slips like an ugly pair of oversized pants on a gansta wanna be. The cap on the top is made of really cheap sheet metal. The top inside of the cap is not coated and shows very bad signs of rust. It does have the dull stainless steel look, but with a immediately obvious cheap look. For this you have the privilege of paying 2x - 3x what a generic one would cost at the big box stores.
1,Turned into a garbled-up mess. The outer material gets all weird and twisted so it's impossible to keep neatly coiled up. I do not recommend it.
1,Doesn't fit anything that DeWalt makes as far as I can tell. Certainly not the 20v MAX saw. I had to go to 3rd party products.
1,Product is small in size, not standard size
1,The size of flashlight is great. The brightness is great as well. BUT the lens cap does not stay screwed in. Keeps unscrewing so the lens pops out. Very annoying. If this did not happen this would be a 5.
1,Broke in 1 hour.
1,Problem with this edger is that paint builds up inside the guide and begins to drip out.  Pretty much useless.  Have alway used a brush and will continue using a brush.
1,Don"t scrap off the boil-over,like I thought it would,
1,I sent this rack back to the sender as it would not mount on my wall tightly, but kept rocking at the holding points.
1,I've been restoring a 200 year old Dutch colonial house for a number of years.  Part of the restoration is the creation of many sets of window and door casings in red oak.  This router has several nice features, like a built-in armature lock for changing the bits from above the table with one (included) wrench and an above-table height adjustment.  The router worked fine for about a month, then suddenly quit working.  It was still under warranty and the Porter Cable service shop took about 3 weeks to fix it.  I used it successfully in a router table for about another year and just before Christmas 2012 needed to do some routing again.  This time the router won't work at any speed setting higher than 6 on the dial.  Although I can use it at that slower speed, I still feel cheated with this tool.  It was expensive and should cause me NO PROBLEMS.  I usually buy the best tools I can afford because I've come to learn that you often get what you pay for, but this router is an exception to that rule.  I do a hobbyist's level of woodworking, not production level, and I expected more from this expensive router - like dependability.  So for Christmas I asked for (and received) a Bosch 1617EVS router, which has the same features and so far is working great.  It seems to me that Porter Cable is best at air-powered tools, as I've never had any problems with their framing and finishing nail guns.  The Bosch router now joins my other Bosch power tools (random orbit sander, compound miter saw and table saw).  The Porter Cable router is now sitting and gathering the dust created by the Bosch router (at least until I can get it fixed again and sell it).
1,I have a couple Shop Fox stands like this one. When i needed another stand, I decided to get this instead of another Shop Fox, for several reasons - first and mainly because another reviewer said it is made in USA. It certainly is NOT made in USA.  It says so plainly on the box.		The second reason i bought this one is because Amazon lists the size as 23x32x32.5, and i wanted something a bit bigger than the Shop Fox. It isn't nearly that big. Perhaps it's that size at the bottom of the legs; certainly not at the usable top, as others like Shop Fox are listed.  It's only 14x25, and even that 14" isn't even one piece of fake "wood" - it's split into 2 pieces only 7" wide, further weakening it.  The Shop Fox, for about the same price as this one, has a slightly smaller top, but at least it's a one-piece top.  Either one should be replaced with real wood or 3/4" plywood for any loads or uses that are even slightly heavy.		The extremely thin steel used in this stand, falsely claimed as "heavy gauge", is exactly the opposite of that.  The steel is very thin and flimsy.  It is 0.045" thick. The steel on my Shop Fox stands is double that - 0.090".  The Shop Fox also has equally heavy gauge reinforcing braces at each upper corner.  This flimsy thing has none at all.		The third reason i got this one was all the good reviews from others who called it "sturdy", "strong", etc.  It makes me really wonder about the value of reading reviews. This stand is ONE-HALF as sturdy as the equally-priced Shop Fox.		It's definitely going back to Amazon, and i am not at all pleased with the deceptions that caused me to order it.
1,I would have been better off with white glue.  sealant was messy and didn't setup well.
1,Made In Low Quality, won't grip worth a squat
1,I received this item (model 550DFR) and installed it.  Installation was easy but only the full flush function worked properly.  I contacted Fluidmaster and was told that this item has been updated to solve this problem.
1,No bag? No case? The "never" version just means the tool doesn't come with anything to store it in.
1,but this light bulb hurts my eyes ! I do not find it restful, soothing or any of the other things that people said it did for them...I could not wait for it to cool off to take it out of the socket. I put it in the lamp beside my bed in hopes it would help me sleep or get in the mood to sleep....I felt like I was in a Halloween party room.....I certainly could not read a book by this light or watch TV with this orange light in my peripheral vision. I swear I just don't understand the high ratings this bulb got. I have a bunch of them that I will save to donate to the Community Thrift store next Halloween. They should go fast and be a hit with the kids....		I'll stick to my LED bed side lamp bulb and be happy. At least I gave it a try !
1,Poor design; does not fit snugly around my eyes and fogged up immediately at the range.  Could not get them to clear up, eventually switched to my backups, an old pair of Pyramex I-Force goggles, which were less than half the price and still outperformed the Wiley X SG-1 in every way.  Was let down by this product, have purchased other Wiley items in the past and have generally been pleased.  Would not recommend these goggles for any application; as their tendency to fog and failure to properly fit could lead to adverse affects whether riding or using for safety purposes...
1,I should have read the reviews, it was way too small for the 6 x 6 post, annoying.  The posts measure 6 x 6 inches, the postcap measures 5 1/2".
1,I tested all briefly before installing and they all worked.  The 2nd night, 1 was flickering, 3rd night it stopped working altogether.
1,It works - can be a bit challenging to open at times.  Have a massage / yoga studio where various teachers use it and different times, in order to have as few as keys as possible floating a round thought a lock box would be a good idea.  There are times when it opens slick as a whistle and its great, there are other times when I am getting calls because the silly thing doesn't open.  The trick appears to be that when you close it, it is important to spin the numbers quite a few times - if the numbers aren't spun enough then it doesn't want to unlock with the combination.		UPDATE:  AUGUST 3RD, 2014 - Arrived at my studio, the lock box is gone, and my studio has been tossed.  Considering the box had to be open to get it onto the door handle - it is a commercial lever - the box had to be disengaged to get it off the door handle.  NOTE:  no damage to the door, or the handle, which says to me that it wasn't that difficult to bust open.
1,This is an inexpensive motion detector spotlight. It's all plastic and it remains to be seen as to how long it holds up.
1,didnt fit on my sink
1,PROS: more brighter than 3 Fireflies	CONS: I think it needs an earthquake to activate the motion sensor	  Poor quality/workmanship, buy a candle its more better.	take my advice Im an electronic tech. buy a motion sensor lite above $10
1,I purchased this filter hoping it would improve the condition of my hair after washing but there has not been any noticeable change. Apparently whatever this filter removes from the water, if anything, is not causing the problem.		Relatively easy to install although it took some effort to get it tight enough to stop minor leaks. No noticeable affect on water throughput.
1,Very uncool.	Only mask and useless without filters. Would have been nice to know before waiting a week for nothing. Now have to wait another week for filters. Thanks for that.
1,Not much heat on low setting. To much air movement. Makes a lot of noise. Tips over easy. Not a grounded plug. WON'T BUY AGAIN..
1,Poor Quality, 1 out of 6 don't work, bought a few times. Filaments shatter inside the bulb
1,I actually ordered the 1 3/16 inch bit. It was not sharp when I received it. There was a large burr on one cutting. It took a lot of work to get this sharp, and it's not perfect yet. Needless to say, the drilling was not as it should be.
1,My fault not learning what 5000K Daylight means.  5000K means bright white so putting them in front of the house does not work, looked very pale.  If you are looking for color similar to incandescent light, should be around 3000K
1,Seller selling plastic bottle product as stainless steel and not allowing the full review to be published. Maybe Amazon will look into its listing and product. False or wrong depiction of the product.
1,Didn't work at all on a small leak, didn't even slow the leak. I should have waited for more people to review it.
1,THE POST SAID IT WAS A 3 MODE FLASHLIGHT. YOU SENT ME THE WRONG FLASHLIGHT. IT  WAS THE 5 MODE. IM TIRED OF GETTING SENT THE WRONG CRAP TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE
1,Was very happy with the smaller version of this light. It is very durable and stays lit for hours, so I decided to get the larger one to put in our tent trailer as we camp a lot where there are no hookups and I didn't want to mess with the lantern anymore. When I received the light, I tried it out in the house and it worked great. Very bright and stayed lit for hours. Then, a week before our trip, I set the solar light up in my trailer to test it out. At home my trailer is in direct sun so no charging issues. I was out working in the trailer a lot after dark and I had no issues. Again it lit up my tent trailer perfectly and stayed bright for a couple hours. However, when we were on our camping trip the light started to malfunction. And on day 2 almost quit completely. It wouldn't say it was charging and then would just decide to turn on one time and not another. We were camped under a lot of trees and the solar panel didn't stay in direct sunlight as long as it did at home but I also had the smaller version of this light charging in the same spot and never once had an issue with it not getting enough sun light to charge. ***UPDATE: have now used the larger solar lights (3 of them in all) several times and I'm really not impressed. You will only get light for just a couple hours and two of the 3 I bought, sometimes won't work at all. Overall, disappointed that I paid as much as I did and can't rely on this product to work when I need it too or for very long
1,These are poorly manufactured and poorly engineered.		My first one failed from two pinhole leaks in the internal plumbing.		They replaced it on warranty. A couple monthly later, the second unit's electrical controls failed.		These will make your LED lights flicker. The heater's modulation is apparently not synchronized to the AC line voltage, which causes voltage transients.		So, in the trash it goes.
1,Arrived broken.. Plastic holding the ear plug was snapped on arrival.
1,As other reviewers have noted, this part DOES NOT FIT all the models they claim that it does.  And it is not returnable!  Mine is in the trash.  Buyer beware.
1,Batteries don't fit any unit I have.  I tried installing these in several items - couldn't get the battery door back on. Not sure why these batteries are so large. Sent them back.
1,I have been using these for years but the last two I ordered were defective, and would not allow a reasonable amount of water through. It seems like something in the manufacturing has changed. I cannot use these any longer and have switched to a different type of filter.
1,I really liked it for a while. After 5 months it was much dimmer. I changed the batteries but it didn't matter. Then it lost the color blue, along with being quite dim. I see other reviewers having the same experience so I wouldnt buy this again.
1,Description is wrong, you have to cut 2-7/8" hole, I bought wrong drill bit based on description.
1,Very disappointed in this product.  It just shows you that the majority of the reviews are fake / paid for - and can't be trusted.  When doing a side-by-side comparison against an Ultrafire SK68 UV Light, the OxyLED does not make stains glow.  Its almost as if it is just a purple light.  The only objects that appeared to glow are those that are white in color.  Waste of money because it will cost me as much to ship back to the seller
1,This particular fan has worked out OK for me.  BUT!!!		I bought another one of these at about the same  time and the unit failed completely within 5 months of its installation. I contacted Minka, who informed me that they would not honor their warranty because the unit was sold by Amazon. (They would, however, give me the repair part numbers so I could buy them. Nice of them, wasn't it?) Now Amazon tells me that they will not honor the warranty because it was sold more than 90 days ago! So I'm out the entire purchase price of this fan....		I find it incredible that Amazon offers goods knowing that the manufacturer will not honor his warranties.		Amazon's business has to be built on the trust of customers who are buying products sight-unseen, and I believe their action here is a violation of that trust.		I'll certainly not be buying anything associated with the Minka name, and having been burned once I'll have to be more careful before buying anything from Amazon that involves a guarantee of any kind.
1,biodegradable very fast. Disolves in sunlight.
1,Ducting was great but Clamps provided are absolute garbage, and after clamps wouldn't even tighten down without spreading the screw case I had to throw them away and get my own. Otherwise, I'd give 5 stars
1,I ordered this Wilton 4 1/2" vise to use in my shop. Quality is not very good. You get what you pay for I guess, It is cheaply made, it has a lot of play in the threads and the tolerances are far from tight. I am constantly having to tighten the swivel base as it keeps loosening while I use it. I put a pipe fitting in the vice to hold as I tighten it and the base rotates. Have to take a hammer to the handle and tap it to tighten the base enough to hold. It works but is not anything like the American Made Wilton's I have bought in years past.	If I could send it back I would.
1,The knife was sharp, and in good condition. Opening the knife was not user friendly. I want to use the knife right out of the box, not have a " break in" period .
1,Get the Dewalt charger.  The B&D products are cheap and do not last very long at all.  When you buy, get a double charger.
1,Cheap, bad, no good, broke on the first use. The hammer come off.
1,I have 2 of these in the house we just bought.  One for the upstairs unit and one for the downstairs unit.  Programming these are a royal pain in the rear and as others have said, the stated temperature listed is rarely the correct temperature.  Mine don't eat through batteries, at least not yet.  You can program them if you dare.  Sometimes they'll follow the programming you input, but sometimes they won't.  And don't get me started on the stupid cover plate that you have to remove to program the thing and also to switch from heating to cooling.  Even my HVAC guy who maintains my heating and cooling units told me that he hates Honeywell Thermostats, but he really disliked th RTH230B's.  I'm going to take his recommendation and buy 2 better thermostats.  Wonder if Honeywell would give me my money back?  Nah, probably not.
1,Pretty stunned to see all these positive reviews. This magnetic wrist band is garbage. It contains two small weak magnets that struggle with holding much other than a couple of small screws. Even if this item was free l would have no use for it.
1,It broke after a few months. Really bad product.
1,Nice bright LED lights that light up my closets that don't have 120v outlets or ceiling lights. I bought these because of the Motion Detection feature. Unfortunately I would have to be in the closet with the door shut to activate the light or with the hall lights out. The motion detector  is activated (and this is a quote directly from the instruction sheet) "ONLY WHEN IT IS DARK AND MOTION IS DETECTED". We're not talking ambient light here. It has to be dark.		Also when the light is activated by the motion detector it only stays on for a short time, ~20 seconds. If using in a closet that doesn't give you enough time to find what you are looking for.		Other motion detectors I have work in most lighting conditions, not complete darkness.		I do like the lights and will keep them as they have a on/off switch but I am very disappointed that it is not mentioned in the product description about the motion detector. The motion detector option was the main reason I bought these lights for my closets.
1,Metal is very brittle so if you actually want to use this you should be very gentle. I broke mine within a week using it for some light tasks like tightening a screw in a lamp, opening a root beer, etc. So gerber sent me a new one, it broke as well but this time one of the screws snapped rendering the pliers useless. Gerber used to be a good brand but not so much anymore.
1,Have you noticed that the majority of reviews for this light are four or five words from reviewers like "chiu-hsiung yang," "Amazon Customer," and "acanal"? These are fraudulent reviews by employees and associates of Soonhua who are paid to buy this product from Amazon.com (in order for it to show up as a "verified purchase") who then post five stars to artificially boost the overall rating for this piece of garbage.		Look at those 'glowing' reviews: "Excellent. Works nicely!"  /  "very good"  /  "I like it '"  /  "So far they are working perfect."		And then look at the 1-star, 2-star, and 3-star reviews -- some by authentic Top 1000 reviewers -- who go into depth about this emergency power failure light's fatal flaws... like not working when it counts!		We just had a power outage, and while every other power failure light from other companies worked perfectly, this one from Soonhua DIDN'T WORK AT ALL. It had been plugged in right up until the outage, so it had a full charge. Yet it did not turn on, no matter which switch position I tried. I even tried plugging it into my UPS Backup power supply and couldn't get it to work at all.		Then the power came back on, I plugged in the light (after it had sat useless for 5 hours), and it turned on immediately. What the heck?!?		===> The main problem is that the unit doesn't charge properly when it's left in the switch UP position (always on and always charging), and so when a power failure occurs, it can't function when it's most needed.		Further testing seemed to indicate it *might* work if left in the switch DOWN position (always off and always charging), but there's no guarantee. I would avoid this light like the plague, even though it's the brightest LED emergency nightlight of all the ones I've purchased.		The best ones during this most recent power outage were the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-American-Red-Cross-Blackout-Buddy-the-emergency-LED-flashlight-blackout-alert-and-nightlight-pack-of-2-ARCBB200W-DBL/dp/B0045W0MD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The American Red Cross Blackout Buddy the emergency LED flashlight, blackout alert and nightlight, pack of 2, ARCBB200W-DBL</a>&nbsp;which unfortunately covers both outlets;&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Greenlite-NL-WH-3-1-CD-1-LED-3-in-1-Night-Light-Emergency-Light-amp-Flashlight/dp/B000A396CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Greenlite NL/WH/3/1/CD/1 - LED 3-in-1 Night Light, Emergency Light, & Flashlight</a>&nbsp;which unfortunately isn't very bright; and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Amertac-Westek-71134CC-LED-Power-Failure-Light-White-Rechargeable-Ni-Cad/dp/B00CAOAWIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Amertac-Westek 71134CC LED Power Failure Light, White, Rechargeable Ni-Cad</a>&nbsp;which unfortunately can't double as a night light.		If the Soonhua had actually worked, it would have been my #1 choice because it doesn't cover both outlets, it's very bright, and it can double as a night light. But if I'm going to trust this hardware to keep my family safe in a power failure, and it doesn't succeed at that most fundamental functionality, then it goes in the garbage!		It doesn't help that the instructions included with the light are almost complete gibberish.
1,It survived my dives with no leaks so the seals are good.  The light pattern in average at best and I'm not convinced that it is anywhere near to 800 lumens.  The hot spot, while adequately bright, is far too small for a real dive light and it's too awkward to hold and use as a focus light for my camera.  I took note of the warnings about the lanyard and immediately replaced it - so I didn't lose mine!		The big reason for only 2 stars is that it turned off during almost every dive on my trip.  I suspect something is overheating and causing it to shut down since the battery was still good and it would turn on for the next dive.  Fortunately I was not relying on it for my primary light - otherwise it would have been bad.		All in all it's an expensive waterproof flashlight that I'll take camping - but it's never going diving with me again.
1,This sander is one of worst sanders I have ever used, before I use this one I chose a worn out Porter Cable.  1st course grit sanding disc  80 an that is on power 6. I could go on but this sander is BAD. I paid $249.
1,I don't think this lasted 2 days on my wall before they started peeling and falling off.  It also is about half the size of what is shown on the picture.  This is one instance where you get what you pay for. I will NOT be buying any more of these!
1,Adapter is difficult to insert and equally difficult to remove from 18V tools. With only one 20v adapter and owning numerous 18V tools, the frequency of adapter swaps to utilize the 20v batteries in a variety of tools made the benefit of using this battery solution less than optimum. I opted to stick with 18V XRP batteries.
1,WARNING!!! - PLEASE READ!		I needed a CrazyFire LED headlamp for my hiking excursions at night and this looked to be a great option. I received this product at a discount price in exchange for an honest review and thus that I shall give.		The CrazyFire LED headlamp arrived in a cardboard, secure in its package. The headmount fits securely and comfortably on my head, the lights are extremely bright. They are very overpowering if flashed in someone's eyes, so please be careful who you shine the light on. At 5000 lumens, that is a very, very bright light source. The body of the lights are constructed in an aluminium alloy, which they claim is waterproof. I have yet to test that claim and do not wish to risk it. At first I was hoping that they came with batteries or that it mentioned what kind of batteries it used.		Fortunately for me that I have a vape lounge and kept some 18650s in my home to test it. All in all I can see this to be a great light for camping, hiking, riding bike at night or even walking the dog. However I am certain because of the brightness, it will attract many bugs, so have some bug spray handy. The unit comes with a charger cable which will take forever to charge (2) 18650s so make sure that you get a dual battery charger for them elsewhere.		MEMO: About Dual 18650 Batteries:		* Use batteries that match, are paired/married voltage and amperage w0ise.	* Never use scratched batteries or batteries that do not charge properly, those can become dangerous.	* Stay away from any batteries with "FIRE" in their name, use EFest, Samsung, LG, Sony, reputable vape batteries instead	* Defective batteries can cause the batteries to burst into flame and cause serious injuries		Pros:	* Super Bright lights with strobe features,	* Great aluminium housing	* Easy to use on/off, mode button	* Adjustable headlamp makes it easier to direct while on.	* Comfortable, supportive head band		Cons:	* No mention of what batteries to use in description	* Charger cable is useless to charge dual 18650s properly - Get a Efest dual or quad battery charger at a vape lounge.	* !8650's can malfunction when wet, I worry about these being placed on your head.	* NO VENTING! - Battery tray should have gas release holes for the venting of dual 18650 batteries - This is dangerous.	* Batteries overheating cause severe burning and injury to individuals. Very Dangerous!		WARNING::		I would be very weary about this headlamp in wet conditions and when using faulty batteries. The last thing you want is dual 18650s becoming defective on your head and burning up. This could lead to a very dangerous situation. The manufactured should have used a sealed, chargeable battery source which would be far less dangerous. There are too many safety issues to recommend to my friends, or to leave a positive feedback. Safety is everything and people depend on it.		FTC - I received a discount for this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

1,We purchased this to inspect for cat spray. Even though we could smell the pee, it did not glow under this light.
1,This product is cheep and does NOT WORK. DO NOT BUY.  I am sure they would take it back, but is too cheep to waste my time and I am sure they know that.  Amazon should not sell this product
1,This lamp may save electricity, however the cost of the lamp and the life of the lamp compared to the electricity that it saves is pathetic.  We will not be purchasing any more of these for sure!!!
1,Junk. Bought a pack of six and so far 4 out of 6 dead after three months of intermittent usage.
1,I was pleased until after two months my light has gone out and this was not a cheap light. Not worth the money don't buy!!! I am so upset after spending my money
1,This is one bright light. Have never seen so even of a beam. No filament image, just a bright and even circle. Well made and just barely worth the price. But, after about 3 months, the unit would just stop working after 1 or 2 minutes of use. Called the manufacturer and they replaced the entire unit. Very nice customer support. But, now, after 1-1/2 years of very infrequent use (6 minutes per YEAR), the newer unit is not shutting down after 1-2 minutes of use. Sometimes comes right back on, but sometimes won't come back for an hour. I have this unit for standby use during power failures. It's totally untrustworthy for that use.
1,Broken in two months of everyday (1 time a day? 2 minutes) use.		Reason - no overscrewing protection.		It's turned on and off with screwing or unscreqing the cap accordingly. The contact of light diode with batteries became bad with time and one day it just refused to light on.		Bad. =(((
1,I purchased two of these.	First one never worked so, thought the best cure was to buy another.	Second one worked momentarily and then stopped. Wrote to the company and after a good deal of time (and some trickery), was able to get them both repaired and returned. Only use it on simple stuff (low wattage). Wanted to use it in my woodworking shop (namely my vacuum system). Afraid to. Currently use one inside (on a radio) and one outside (on a heating pad in the cat's box) with no problem but I don't think they are worth the money nor the effort especially since they are so prone to breakage.
1,I bought many LED at Wholesales company, very single one will dead, stop working after a year, product look very nice and they should be work up to 25000 hours but they are not even work to 2nd year. I never buy any LED light at this company again.
1,These worked great until about my fifth charge. I went to insert the charge cord And the USB receptacle broke off.  I took the headset apart and its a cheap circuitboard and there was no way to reattach it. Usually on circuit boards you reinforce the USB charging piece with a wire over it at least thats the way I used to do it when I build circuit boards.
1,The product came packed very poorly and  did not look as advertised.  I ended up purchasing additional racks from lowes where the quality was better and the prices were lower.
1,OK
1,I wish I had pay more attention to the reviews. Too difficult to assemble, stay away. No instructions and some of the parts came apart while in transit. I believe this item comes from China,as there were customs papers in the mailing stamp; therefore took a long time for delivery.  I wish Amazon will disclose what items are coming from other countries.
1,Did not work on receipt.. easy to tell, you don't have to take it out of the packaging to try it.. the prongs stick out..does not turn on with motion at DARK.. what else matters..
1,Too small but the adhesive did stick where they were placed.  They slid off and onto the floor.
1,Go figure - the return window is 1 year and this fan lasted 13 months.  I admit, I did leave it running for days at a time.  Maybe I expect too much but I think it should be able to run for days.  The other reviewers were also correct - it is loud.  There weren't many fans out there that met the specs I need.  But I'll have to find one because I won't purchase this brand again.  At least it lasted a year!
1,Do not buy
1,keeps giving false alarms even when all gas is turn off!
1,Quit working in the 1st 2 minutes
1,I received this bulb. The tracking still shows it being shipped. The plastic top was separated. I can turn the loose plastic that should not move. I did test it, the bulb lights up. I would call this more like a night light intensity. As this was to test. I found it lacking in workmanship, poor handling, and slow shipping. Packaging was poor.
1,I installed 3 disposals in my life so I am not a rooky. The instructions they provide leaves out a critical piece of info. When I called for clarification I was told that they could only read the same instruction I have and do not employ people to answer technical questions. That I should call a plumber.	Hey it's their poor instructions; I asked a couple of DIY friends and they couldn't understand it.	That wasn't the big problem. The major disappointment was how rude the reps were. The worst I experienced in 40 years of DIY work.	Amazon has other good brands. Skip this one. What good is a product with poor support.	Interesting, Amazon has some of the best support; KitchenAid has by far the worst.
1,Stop making me re-write these reviews, Amazon. NOT COOL!		As I said: This is not an American-made Product.		I just bought a 6500watt generator today, with a 220 outlet on it.	And guess what:		The power plug on this so-called 'PLASMA CUTTER', DOES NOT FIT AN AMERICAN POWER OUTLET!!!!		The liars also claimed that it's dual Voltage. You're supposed to be able to do 120v and 220v, right??		But how are you supposed to do that, when this non-american made product,	doesnt come with an Adapter cable, to work with an AMERICAN POWER OUTLET!?!?!?		----- UPDATE -----		It Just doesnt cut it... no Pun intended...	It won't cut 3/8" Steel, so how the hell is it supposed to cut 1/2" ???	I spent 5 minutes in 1 single spot, and only burned my hand.	See the 4th (newest) image.
1,If you are into aggravation this is the product for you. I started with the two white bulb starter kit with the intention of controlling them with an Echo and a Dot. Phone control was only a secondary novelty.	Setup is an adventure because there are no published step by step instructions. It initially seems easy but then you find that you have to to download and use two different apps and the order that you do things is important. They say to use a Phillips Hue app but they don't even give you a link to find it so it's up to you find it amongst the third party apps.	After about three set up attempts I finally got complete control of the lights from the phone and Echo. I then added two more white lights which should have been simple given my experience but wasn't. I then bought a color strip and that's when things got really bad. I got it added to my system but it didn't work the way I expected. The white lights stayed on full and the colored lights were only adjustable with the Hue app but but not with the Echo. I fired off an Email to Phillips tech support but after two days of no response I requested an exchange and got another strip in two days. Another prolonged setup later and now I have complete control of the white lights with either the Hue app or the Echo but no color control with the Echo. Apparently you are supposed to load the Hue app from WITHIN the Amazon-Alexa app so it has a 'skill'. After yet another setup I think I've got it. Wishful thinking. I appear to have control with both the phone and and voice but then Alexa refuses to cooperate because she says I have two devices with the same name. Sure enough, I open the Alex app and all my lights are listed twice, one as they appeared before I setup Hue within Alexa and again with via hue added. I deleted (forget) all the originals and it appears to work again but the all the duplicates popped up again. I've yet to solve that problem.	I finally did hear from tech support this morning and rather than offer any advice they requested proof of purchase. All they'll get from me is a bad review.	3_12_18. If you've read this far add another star. For reasons I can't explain all the lights have become much more stable, including the strip. All the smart lights perform exactly as promised with both the app and Alexa but I still can't manipulate the strip color with Alexa. I only occasionally change the mood color so on/off/dim by voice is enough. I'm sure I could eventually get it but it's not worth the effort. I don't want it that bad. It's so stable now that I bought a second (whole new review about pricing) and the setup was almost instatanious. Plug into AC outlet, add to Hue app, rename, and then add to Alexa app. Use.
1,I purchased this cord based on the picture. The outlets are two on one side and one on the other. The picture has all three on the same side. Do not buy if that's what you're looking for. Otherwise this is just a plain extension cord that is a bit overpriced.
1,It has this lines etched across the reflector that leaves shadowed line and black patches that doesn't gives a clear field of illumination. Nothing great about this feature nor the item itself.
1,Broke on first use :(  I was using them to play paintball in and one slide and it snapped off.. Pointless
1,Worked well for 5 months and then just failed to run. Normal usage nothing strenuous..
1,a package of 5, even though it was OK, one of the bulb has obvious defect with separation inside with less light emitting. returned to Amazon
1,Messed up with LED's and 3way installation is random...		These switches are great if you have pre historic incandescent bulbs...forget LED. Whoever at Jasco/GE decided that it was smart not to include a neutral wire is the dumbest Product manager on earth. These units have no neutral which means they are succeptible to flickering BECAUSE at low intensity, there is not enough power left. No White, No luck really. Oh they will work at first but at lower dimming levels, they will just switch OFF and you will need to press 3 times on the rocket to hopefully make them turn on again.		The previous models with the wires in the back AND a neutral were much better		3WAY installation:		It works and doesnt work...it is a matter of luck.		Conclusion: You should NEVER buy a dimmer that doesn't have a neutral wire, period.		Maybe GE will wake up and realize they need switches that work properly with LED's and gave a NORMAL 3way implementation not an exotic one that is unreliable....
1,I bought this at the same time as the 500 lumen oxy LED. The 1200 lumen Led sniper is not nearly as bright as the 500 lm oxy LED. In addition, the Ledsniper comes with a battery charger that is too small for the rechargeable battery that comes with it. I should have returned it, but it has now been over 30 days.
1,Worst bulbs we every purchased.  They say that they have a 5 year life expectancy, but we have had all but two go bad in just one month.  They were all in different lamps.  Don't trust anything from this vendor.  Total Crap!
1,Doesn't fit well at all. Not very bright once modified to fit properly.	I would have sent it back is I hadn't thrown away the packaging... not worth the effort to return.
1,These rods are smaller than any other 1/16 I have ever seen. I have many different welders including high current and low current ac and dc welders. These rods ran like garbage. If you want to weld a paper clip and a tack nail then these are for you. Good luck.
1,Even on clean glass, with NOTHING hanging on it, it won't stay. I've tried over & over, and it will "screw" on and feel really really tight & secure, but within a few hours it falls off. Really disappointed.
1,I bought these for automotive silicones ans the roll off the thread and are too large for the nozzle.
1,bad product it didn't wok like it said
1,I usually don't just trash a product, however after Brita discontinued a previous model that was great (owned two) they came out with this abomination. I thought there may have been an installation issue, however the unit is just a uncontrolled leak, from the fitting seams, from the unit, from the valve, etc. I just bought the pitcher model and deal with filling it up which is really no big deal, however do not waste you time or efforts on this absolute failure of a product.
1,didn't work for me
1,Lasted maybe 4-5 welding jobs around the house before it died in the middle of a project. (made a couple tables, a welding cart etc.) All in all I'd say less than 4 hours of actual welding time. At first I thought it was just the batteries but after I replaced them it's still dead. Guess I shouldn't have cheaped out on a welding helmet. I'm gonna go spend the extra $200 on an optrel vegaview like I should have done in the first place...
1,Tangles much more quickly than I expected from this type of hose. Update: now that I've used it more, I can't stand it. It's a backup in my shop. The only upside is light weight, but it's not worth that. I love my ultra air 3/8 rubber, soft, supple, non marking hose.
1,I just upgraded my old Malibu landscape lights with T10 LED Bulb for cars different colors available
1,Doesn't put the toilet paper at proper angle to use
1,doesn't stick to even small holes
1,Maybe it was me, this hurt my fingers when I used it.
1,Someone really bragged these up to me about how long they last, so I paid the extra money for them.  They didn't last any longer than my regular rechargeable batteries.
1,Cheap quality. High pressure shower, and don't really have the ability to control it - as the switch is an on-off switch
1,100% cheap crap. Not worth a cent. Added 1 star for comparatively reliable hands (compared to non name chines glasses).
1,Sounds tinny, standard doorbell sounds aren't great and it is somewhat inconsistent, despite the receiver being less than 10 feet away.  I'd suggest another brand. Also, the seller will harass you over email to write a review.
1,Wrong size, just like the other reviews. I wasn't able to give it zero stars or a 1/2.
1,Nice looking and the slow cover works well. Problem is, it loosens up much too easily, and constantly tightening the toilet seat is not something I want to do on a regular basis.  A little disappointing...
1,Doesn't work like advertised.
1,It's small and uncomfortable. I do not like it, I do not recommend it.
1,Charged it once, very bright and looks well build, but I went to charge it again and it doesn't work anymore.  I probably only used it about 5 times before having to charge it again and it failing.
1,I received this item seriously damaged probably from another return.  The switch plates were sawed off, the reset button looked depressed and damaged.  Missing caps and mounting screws.
1,I purchased this item so I wouldn't have to keep spending money for filter bags. Unfortunately It  didn't work out that way. This bag just filters too fine and slows down the suction on my machine. Took it off and haven't used it since. Think twice and make sure before buying it.
1,I purchased this and read the instructions that ask you to turn your saw upside down to install. I can't give a full review as I haven't had the time to even attempt this yet. I just want to warn future purchaser's that this is involved in the installation of the unit.
1,Definaetly bright ut also a bad design as it gets too hot to hold in afew minutes making it impractical. Butit--f you donlt palnon havigit inmor ethan a minute its great,
1,had it for 1 week came to flooded kitchen,,both hoses busted..dont buy
1,What hotel or spa were they staying at? As for a shower head? The water comes out and gets you wet. As for the 7 settings? Not one of them gives a good spray that will rinse you off in a minute. It definitely is a water saver though except when you're trying to save water. The big let down here was the switch on the handle. It doesn't turn off the water completely. I should know since I sent one back thinking it was a defect but got another new one that didi the same thing which apparently is a quality standard.
1,The hose on this could not be less flexible. It looks all contorted and does not hang. We needed it asap as we weren't having guests but we will have to replace the hose.
1,Plastic garbage did not magnify as advertised
1,I bought this at the big box store not realizing it was available on Amazon. I am using it on a very old garden bench made out of wood planks affixed to ornate wrought iron frames on either side. There are many,layers of old paint on both the wood and the iron surfaces. I applied the product and let it sit over night. The next day, I was able to remove most of paint from the wood, but not quite all. The wrought iron was much less successful. I could barely scrape off a single layer of paint. I then applied a second coat to the wrought iron only and again waited overnight. The next day, I was able to scrape a good amount of the paint off the left half of the iron base. For some reason unknown to me, no paint came off on the right half. The paint that was removed required a ton of "elbow grease". I'm not giving up...other reviewers suggest that after applying, the furniture can be wrapped in plastic and left for 2 or even 3 days. I think I should try that next.
1,Junk.  We bought this to replace a splendid Black + Decker product, which now has a replacement cost over $100.00.  This  product is OK for very light fabric (sheets, pillow cases)  but will NOT cut a terry towel or a flannel shirt; bogs down six inches into the work.  Tool is difficult to charge, as the two contacts on the tool rest precariously in a cradle, giving you no clear idea that the thing is charging. We charged it for nine hours (we thought; no way of knowing) and the green light on the charger receptacle never came on. Put it away without using it, and it was totally discharged two weeks later..		We've had this since April 2014 (16 months), used it  a couple times, and it never did the job.  Spend the extra money and get something better.
1,*Edit* I was contacted by the company and it appears that my chief complaint with this flashlight is going to be addressed. They are adding last mode memory to the next model which should be available within the next few weeks. I'd recommend waiting for that one if you're interested in an Anker light.		I'm a huge fan of Anker electronics, so when I saw that they had a little LED flashlight, I ordered one. I thought I was going to like it enough that I also ordered some 18650 batteries and a charger! Boy, was I wrong. I'm really not a fan. The flashlight comes with the AAA battery pack, but no sleeve for 18650 batteries, so they rattle around a bit if you try to use them. I decided to stick with the AAA batteries for this flashlight. It has a solid on/off switch with a partial press to change modes. Unfortunately, it changes modes every time I turn it on and off as well. Since I only plan to use this on high mode, it's pretty annoying to have to cycle through all of the modes every time I turn it on. It's pretty bright and theoretically it puts out 400 lumens with the 5W LED bulb, but it doesn't appear to be certified by ANSI and it's not as bright as some of my lower-rated lights.		It seems well made and solid overall. It's relatively grippy for being all aluminum and the aluminum body extends slightly on two sides of the power button to prevent accidental activation. The round design is very strong, but could also result in a runaway flashlight if you try to set it down on its side. I won't be buying another primarily because I have to cycle through the settings every time that I use it. I own more inexpensive flashlights with similar power that aren't nearly as flawed.		I paid full price for this, but it's going in a box with the other cheap LED lights that I've got. Maybe I'll pull it out for a camping trip someday?
1,Must've been new/old stock from day 1.  Bought right from Sears.  I don't know why I didn't return them, come to think of it.  I have to leave the battery in the charger for it to work.  Yes, I know they die after a while but within a day they're near-dead.
1,I had one of these years back and this is the same. I have a form of tremor and need something to hold wires and small pieces. This works but only with a lot of fussing. Wingnut tightening not very effective or convenient so is hart to actually get the alligator clamps to stay in one place.
1,There is missing grit on some of them.  It's cheap stuff.  I wouldn't purchase again.
1,I have refinished furniture for almost 40 years. This is hands down the worst product I have ever used.  It's thick -  thicker than honey and goes on about as well as I imagine cold honey would. The label states "DO NOT THIN" and that it's "Smooth, Self-Leveling".  It isn't. I used a good brush and there are still visible brush lines. I  stored and used it at room temperature. I stirred it well as directed. The doors were as smooth as glass when I started. I see no way I caused this problem. The label also states that it will dry in 2 hours. I seriously doubt that I will be able to sand the doors before tomorrow and then I will have to sand the heck out of them to get down to a suitable surface again. What a mess.
1,The shade on this lamp was completely unacceptable.  It fell apart almost immediately.  Perhaps that is not the fault of the lamp but the fault of whoever made the lamp shade.
1,Printed with a giant blank spot across the sticker. Would ask for my money back but ill just go somewhere else. surprised whoever sent these didn't catch it. Kind of ironic considering the message of the sticker....
1,It works but the overall power generated leaves much to be desired and the total charge time is not impressive. I have had some luck using this on very small projects but I will need to buy a different one for the all around multi tool I thought I was getting. I wish I had done more home work on what this cordless one would get me.
1,The product was made very poorly;  The solar doesn't charge the battery even on more than 8 hours of sunlight.
1,I was disappointed by this product.		It was supposed to be a replacement for a 60w incandescent.		It was not.		It seemed like a 40w, but I have no way to back that statement up - no way to measure.		Thumbs down unless you just want a light for not tripping on stuff.		Not sufficient illumination for me to even recommend it's use it in a clothes closet.
1,Item received had the correct part number on the box (373LM) but the remote inside had different part number (973LM). In addition the case was damaged, it would appear someone had pried open the case and damaged it. I returned the incorrect and damaged item.
1,Box says these bulbs have a 27 YEAR life based on 3 hours of operation per day.  I used 3 of these bulbs around the March 2017 time frame.... all 3 have burned out.  Would have gotten more life out of a regular cheap bulb.  The other 3 are still in the box and I'm going to try to return since these bulbs aren't worth sh%t.
1,Only way to turn it on now is with the little switch.  The thing is cheaply made and priced, so you do get what you paid for.  I took apart the motion sensor and can't see where it failed, but it doesn't turn the light on anymore.  it did work good and it's pretty bright for a month.
1,I was rather disappointed. These are not much better than a normal pair of shades. Perhaps it's because I have a narrow face. The bottoms fit snug but big gap in the top letting a lot of wind in. I'm sure they don't fog but I'd hate to wear them in the rain.
1,The QC on these must be worse than TorchStar I have these in one room and the lighting is considerably poorer.  Also one of them is fading in and out.  I didn't buy them for a haunted house I bought them for my house.  These are half the price of Torch Star ones but not worth the hassle to me.
1,NO
1,I received this at a discount for my review.  It was well made and sturdy but it didn't work.  I am sending it back for a refund.
1,Why one star...? False advertising.  If your going to advertise 300 lumen at least get it into the ball park.	  Putting the light up against two other lights rated at 265 and 275 lumen, this light failed miserably.  The other two lights put out almost identical brightness. So I put the UltraFire beam up against one of the others...  It was like comparing the moon to the sun (actually quoted from my chief engineer who watched as I did it).  The UltraFire failed miserably.  With the naked eye, i would say it looks about 5-10x weaker.	But i am lucky enough to have a lux tester (tests illumination within a room).  It's not ideal for this test, but it at least can give me a unbiased comparison.  With the 275 lumen light it pegged out my lux tester which will not do more than 199,900 lux, which is pretty darn bright. With the UltraFire set up with a fresh 3.6v AA/1 battery the max I could get was 247,000 lux.  Now that speaks for itself.	  There was one pro.  It will take both regular AA batteries and the much more expensive 3.6v AA/1 batteries.  The AA/1 gives you a little more light, but for the price of AA/1 batteries you might as well use AA.  It doesn't make that big of a difference.	 If your looking for a light that packs a punch and is economical, I would go with the "de.power DP-014AA-C" or "Maglite SP+P09H."  They put out much more light.  Weight about the same and take 2-each AA batteries.  Much better lights for the $$ than this light.
1,I went through six refills and still can not quite get it figured out. I mean, I got it working fine; however, it is not a good replacement for their proprietary Co2 tanks. I'm not sure why this is using so much more Co2, but whatever...
1,My wife ordered these (reason why it doesn't say I'm a verified purchaser) assuming they would be RGB lights like the ones we already have. But they are not. Like many others have stated, they are individually red, green, and blue LEDs that are spaced out on the strip. Not the RGB diodes that are connected together. This causes two problems. If the lights are visible, you see the three individual colors, which is super annoying. and second, this strip is super dim. So dim, you can't even tell they are on with other lights on in the room. A total waste of time.
1,These are not as advertised. They are neither solar or rechargeable. Here's why. I disassembled several units and found the following. Two CONVENTIONAL Li batteries are used in series to produce about 6.4 volts. These are CR2016. The "solar panel" was not electrically connected to the circuit board. I measured the output voltage of the "solar panel" and it was about 1.7 volts with no load. There is no way you're going to charge two Li-ion batteries in series with 1.7 volts - which will be less under load. When the batteries discharge, your flashlight will go dark!		By comparison, I got a similar flashlight at Menards for $1.99. It uses a single LIR2032 which IS a rechargeable Li-ion battery. It's solar panel produces 5.9 volts which is more than . The solar panel IS attached to the circuit board and there is another, critical, component on the board - a diode which is used to isolate the solar panel from the battery when there is no light.		I have included two pictures. In the first one you can see the difference between the Menards and Leegoal units. The Menards unit actually has wires connecting the solar panel. In the second picture you can compare the two batteries and see the difference (LIR2032 vs CR2016 - which is actually two batteries stacked together.		My rating of one star is because the product is not as advertised and will fail to function long after it was purchased and probably just get thrown away. After all, your average customer probably won't take it apart and make the same discoveries that I did.
1,This thermostat was missing two key features for me that ultimately made me decide to return it.		First, it has no adjustable hysteresis. The hysteresis is fixed at 1 degree. According to Honeywell: "The RTH6580WF is designed to keep the temperature within +/- 1 degree of what the set point is. Adjusting the differential is not an option."		Second, it has no reporting on how long it has been running. This is 2013.. I had a digital thermostat from 1992 that could tell me how many hours it ran during the previous day, and previous 7 days. Come on.		Turns out they save these software features for their $500 thermostat. I returned this unit and bought the Homewerks Radio Thermostat CT-30 instead. It solved the adjustable hysteresis complaint, and it has an API for me to interface with as well. A raspberry pi and a few hours of programming later and I even have cool graphs so I can see the temperature, when the unit was running, etc.
1,We had to send it back because even though we asked for 3 wires, it came with 4 wires.
1,When I received it, I was skeptical.  Looked like a return, even had dirt along the bottom from someone else's yard?  No instructions.  Didn't work.  Returned it.  Got full refund.  WAS very pretty though.  Smaller than I expected...check your measurements.
1,Useless. Must be for some other system.
1,It works, but too well.  I open the windows and somebody has a fire in the area, it goes off.  I cook something in the toaster oven or oven, it goes off.  I silence it and it goes off again and again.  It does not reset. I tried two, same thing.  Too sensitive for anywhere near a kitchen.  No smoke seen, just goes off when you smell somebody near with a fire or if something is cooking.  Im gonna try another brand.
1,Broke almost immediately
1,The image shows three faucets and no description is given to clarify that you'll only receive ONE. After reading the item name again it appears the seller thinks adding the word "Red" makes it clear. However, that is just a shady practice. The description should make it clear you're only purchasing the red faucet and the image should be cropped to show only the red faucet. The seller has to know this is misleading and they choose to leave it like that. Very disappointed to see Amazon allowing this to remain. They did issue a refund for the misleading item though. Now I have to purchase more faucets to replace the old ones I've already taken off preparing for the THREE I should have received.
1,Didn't work with my weed trimmer, faulty pair. Went with another brand.
1,Did not work at all.  Might be the supposedly new battery.  Didn't complain or try to return, but it is hard to rave about something that failed to help.
1,Not the same quality as DeWalt brand brushes.
1,No where in description of this C7 LED bulb did it say it only illuminates the top half of the fixture and leaves the bottom half dark. Unacceptable.
1,Disappointed with the battery life and the quality of the blade assembly. While they do a satisfactory job of cutting, the battery doesn't seem to last as long as I would expect. I am now on the 3rd blade set because a plastic support post has broken on all 3 head assembly's. My wife only uses these to cut old sheets for weaving.
1,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Moving-Men-8-Piece-Furniture-Slider-Set/dp/B0000645RF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Moving Men 8-Piece Furniture Slider Set</a>		This is okay for moving furniture on a rug.  Do not use them on bare floors of any kind, regardless of what the directions say.  I made the mistake of believing the directions, that they would not scratch non scratchable floors.  They may not scratch them, but they do mar them.  The mar will probably rub out with some work, but am not happy that happened.  They work very well on carpeted floors and are almost effortless with that task.  So I am not recommending this product for uncovered flooring of any kind, but will give it a heads up for carpeted floors.
1,Will I ever be able to get this to work properly?  The lcd screen keeps losing some bars.  The instructions are poorly written.  I hate it.
1,I puchased this brand new 8 hours ago. After an hour of being plugged in for the first time, all of a sudden, I could hear oil spraying out of it.  Within seconds, I had a puddle about two feet wide on the floor.  This was not a slow drip, this was hot oil spraying out under pressure, it sounded like someone trying to get the last of the ketchup out of a squeeze bottle.  Oil is everywhere... What a POS.  Picture shows the leak about 5 minutes later when the oil is no longer under pressure.  I'm definitely glad I was in the room when it blew, things could have been much worse.
1,The light it produced was great, but now (bought it back in November 2011) 4 bulbs blew out and now my old lights have more intensity than this one. So I went back to my old lights that came with the Fluval Edge.
1,As a safety engineer who investigates ladder accidents, I recommend that any step ladder you purchase have a duty rating of at least 250 pounds for safety. Also, the aluminum models, while lighter weight, are also more flexible and easier to tip over. I recommend a fiberglas model.	I purchased this ladder for destructive testing, not for use.
1,had same power as mine no difference
1,Sight unseen, defiantly not usabel for me, to thick
1,The metal is good quality (3/5 stars). It's firm, doesn't warp or bend. As expected.	The fasteners are cheap (2/5 stars). It looks like a few will pop off during normal/average use. Further, two key fasteners are missing on one side.	The opening/closing mechanism requires a great deal of care of open properly without jamming. As mentioned above, 2 fasteners are missing causing one side to pull open easily and thus jamming the other side. You can't just pull the box open like a normal tool box, you have to gently tug on the side with the correct number of fasteners. I'll have to buy a couple nuts/bolts to fix this.		Overall, the box would be a good value if the fasteners were better quality and none were missing. However, by missing two, it makes it difficult to use without a gentle touch--not something that should be required for a steel box containing tools.
1,This ladder works well only in A-frame form with the scaffolding.  When set up to the full 15.5 feet, there is too much flex in the ladder for it to be safely used.  It is not stable and bows constantly.  After using this ladder for exterior and interior painting work on my home, I would purchase a different product.  I am 5'7 and weigh 150 pounds and do not feel comfortable using this ladder as it is marketed.
1,when I bought this chuck I was so happy that his is going to fit  y lathe spindle according to the details for the fact that there is an adapter included in the package that is 3//4 " 16 TPI and my lathe spindle is 3/4" 16 TPI..... that means this is just great... it is just plug and play.... But unfortunately; the reality was disappointing situation.... the adapter didn't fit he spindle... it seemed to a fine tread (UNF) and the spindle is coarse (UNC).... when I tried to mount it is loose as if its wider than the spindle....
1,Nice light system just not very bright.
1,No instructions and no screws were provided. I have still not installed it.
1,Bought 4 and all 4 leaked horribly.  Used a different make and model and they worked great.  Stay away from this one.  It is junk.
1,This does NOT look anything like the photo.. It is a regular 5/8 spark plug socket, NO SWIVEL
1,I give this five starts because the crystal I received is not the same as pictured.  I like the one they sent just fine but it doesn't have that design around the edge.  It's not quite the same shape either.  If they had pictured what I actually received, I'd give it a five stars.
1,I saw this handy tool and thought "WOW!, that would be great for camping!" I was disappointed when I got to my camp site and opened up all of the accessories and there was not a single camper to be found... NOT EVEN A TENT! What kind of crap is that? :(
1,I reviewed the test data for this filter on the manufacturers website: http://www.thepurestone.com/		I found the data confusing. Especially as it relates to the testing for microbiological contamination. I also noted that the company states that they were once affiliated with Seagull. So I sent an email asking for a comparison of the two filters and for more information on the microbiological contaminants that this filter will remove. They have not as yet replied.		Since we live in an area where microbiological contamination has been a problem in the past, I went with the original Seagull filter as they provide clear and unambiguous test data. In fact after a trip to Lowe's, I found all of the filters provide clearer and less ambiguous data than the PurestOne. At this point I don't know if this is a bargain that is just as good as Seagull, or if it is a lesser quality filter. I think the manufacturer needs to address this clearly and unambiguously for the consumer.
1,Easy to attach, works great so far other than making the dog wonder what's going on. Will buy again.		Update: Unfortunately, it quit working a couple of days ago. The light began changing colors by itself then go dim, so I changed the batteries. The green still didn't put out much light and after switching it to another color, it died after two days. Too bad because the idea is good, just not the product.
1,Works fine for both my garage and my gate into my neighborhood but the range is very limited for the gate transmittion (uses the dip switches), the range is so short I have to take it off my visor in order to get it to work. In contrast my old opener that came with the gate works from about 40-50 feet away. Shame the range is so poor as it is a nice looking item and pretty compact.
1,I paid $18.99 for this simply because of the appearance of this tape measure. Stainless case appealed to me. It's neat but functionality is an issue. When the tape is stretched out, it does not stay in that lock position. It slowly moves back and make it difficult to measure. When I wrap it up, the tape does not goes back to original position, so have to push it back manually all the time. This problem started from the first day of purchase and continues.	Also I thought $18.99 is very high for this tape measure, now, less than 2 months later, price dropped to $13. I've purchase 4 Komelon tape measures, most of those has mechanical problems, either from the beginning or a month later. I do not recommend this product instead recommending either Bostitch, or Johnson's.
1,This item is a useful, inexpensive addition to my smaller-profile (i.e. Mag-lites) flashlights.
1,The first unit quit after 1 hour (no hot air).  We returned and just received the replacement and it has no hot air at all. Poor quality!
1,God I dislike Volkswagen.
1,The noise level of this $300 disposal is virtually identical to the $100 one we replaced. The claim about being able to hold a natural conversation while it's running is absolutely not true.
1,Arrived damaged, locking mechanism on handle would not lock in place.
1,My back door is a storm door, then an exterior steel door. Between the door and door frame I was getting air in. Along with the top of frame (interior). I have some other thicker weatherstripping that I had purchased that was black. I used that in several areas without problem, so figured this would do the same. It is more pliable, so I thought it would be perfect for the door. WRONG. Installed easily and looks nice. For less then one day. Then it all peeled off. Even the top of the door where there is no movement, so I am really disappointed. I would not purchase this again.
1,Do NOT buy. I'm about 250 and these straps just broke with me in my hammock. They stretched out and then snapped. Terrible.
1,Update November 25th, 2016.		No response from manufacturer. We returned from a trip to find out that the other three LED bulbs have failed. I look forward to hearing from the manufacturer/seller. Email sent to info@rclite.com		******************Original Review**********************	I am surprised that within 9 months of low usage (a few minutes a day), one of the bulbs has already gone out. Based on the other review below, I contacted the seller via email and did not receive a response. I am quite disappointed, to say the least. One reason to use LED is for the longevity, and the resulting lower waste. I hope the manufacturer would respond (if so, I'd update this review).		You can see in the photo I posted that only a row (out of many) is lighting up dimly.
1,This product is cheap and flimsy. It is pretty simple to mount but comes off easily. The light is fairly dim as well. I would not recommend.
1,Broke after the second time I used it.
1,It's very light and moves around easily when trying to clean the iron tip in it. Made of plastic and light. It needs a much heavier base on it to be useful.
1,They work really well for going over your glasses, but unless you want a migraine don't buy these guys. Go for the clear pair.
1,Yet, still won't open.  I bought this safe because of good reviews on Amazon.  I shouldn't have waited until today to use this safe.  The key lock is not the problem.  It's the red bar that you have to press with your thumbs to open the safe.  It is defective.  No matter how hard I press with my thumbs (nearly breaking them), it still won't open.  I have to get a hammer and turn it upsidedown and pound on the red bar before it would snap open.  But then, if it close, it won't open again the normal way.  It's too bad tat I have past 30 days return window so I have to contact the mfg.  Now, I have to wait for their response.
1,It's much thinner than I thought it would be. Be careful putting this up, it rips very easily.
1,The photo sensor died in less than a week. Seller returned the money. I would not buy it again.
1,These lights are not very bright I would not recommend them in less you need low light. We put a dimmer switch in and did not need to use it. Actually we wanted them brighter
1,This clicker was extremely easy to program with my Craftsman opener, and it seem to be relatively sturdy. The range of the unit, however, is terrible. Our previous clicker could open the garage door from half way down the block. With this one, we need to be within about 10 feet of the garage door, which means we have to pull into the driveway and then stop and wait for the door to open before pulling in. It works well enough that I am keeping it, but I will certainly consider a different brand next time around.
1,easy to cut.  works to a certain extent but not as well as I had hoped.
1,great flashlight when it works. the clip attachment is great to be able to have the option to clip to your hat. The on off button is kinda hard to engage if you even have medium size hands. and it only lasted about a week before it wouldn't turn despite changing the battery. tried to contact customer service and they said its a non returnable item. don't waste your money.
1,I looked high and low for a solution that was powered directly from the home versus requiring batteries.  I was pleased with this product and the installation was easy.  Unfortunately one of the two units failed after six about months.  I pulled it down and tried switching channels all to no avail.	Reading the reviews it appears that this is a fairly common issue and in my opinion represents a clear flaw in their quality control process.  There is probably some internal component that could easily repaired if I had the wherewithal to do so.  There is just something that is so incredibly frustrating about handing over good money and receiving a inferior product.	***********	I contacted Westinghouse directly and they provided a replacement. I'm very pleased with the customer service, however my opinion of the product stands.
1,Doesn't look like any red oak I have ever seen! Its almost orange in color and looks like crap!
1,bad bad bad
1,Battery stinks
1,Colors are not an accurate match to factory colors!
1,There is a reason it is so inexpensive. It emits a loud buzz when a USB device is plugged into it. And it is so wide that it would be dangerous to install in a metal box or in any box with another device. Spend a few more bucks on a better product.
1,Okay, I did see other reviews, and they were cheap, but I figured "how bad can they really be?" Well, they are really, really bad. I only needed to make two 5" holes, who know's when I will need a 5" hole saw again, so I decided to gamble on these as the whole set was cheaper than any single 5" bit.		It did work, though about broke my wrist putting the duct wholes in as the blades are not flat causing binding, they are so dull I actually checked to see if my drill was in reverse, don't push to hard or you'll bend them more, and they came covered in oil.		So if you have one, small project and it is less than 1/2" thick, these might work for you, any more and you'll be sorry.
1,This is a poorly manufactured product - it does not work - only 2 of my 4 ports ever worked
1,Does not work for hot items as disclosed in the insert.
1,tape is described as 3/4 inch tape.  It is not.  My application calls for 0.75 inch tape, not 18mm which  is too narrow.  I will be returning the product	for credit.
1,I purchased this item at a discounted price through Amazon, it was delivered and did not work. I was going to throw this flashlight in the trash but decided to figure out why it failed. I found a few bad craftsmanship problems that others might want to look for.		Here are the things I found:		1: Underneath the switch device I found that when I pulled the white plastic button piece out, the top end bent up and there was an aluminum flat contact metal that should be soldered through the plastic housing was bunched up underneath. I melted the bit of plastic holding the copper contact metal on and it came off, the soldering was holding nothing in place. So I bent the aluminum piece from the button straight and melted the solder off the copper contact metal then routed the aluminum metal through the housing and through the contact piece then soldered it all into place. (Which is what it should have been like in the first place) then I re-melted the plastic bit holding the copper end on. I also added some hot glue to it all so it could withstand being dropped.		2: On the battery housing unit, on the bottom the little copper rivet was not making contact with the piece of metal that has a little spiral on it in which the positive end of a battery comes to rest. I squeezed that flat with a rivet tool then added a little solder for extra support, I did this at the top piece of rivet also.. it did not look too trustworthy.		3: On the bottom of the little round board that holds the LED's in place you can see where the LED wires are soldered onto the board there was solder melted over two ends of one of the LED bulb wires, I guess the machine making these contact did not know common sense. I melted the solder off, then made the correct contact points.		I could understand one of these problems and say well.. mistakes happen.. but all three??? It's like that robot making the flashlights was on facebook talking to its girlfriends , gabbing about some guy who looked rip at the football game and just didn't care what kind of job it was doing and threw this turd in some plastic blister pack.. which was halfway open when it arrived.		Amazon was great and had nothing to do with the quality of craftsmanship and refunded me without me even asking, There is nothing wrong with this company's value of customer service. On the other hand, I would have written to Dorcy with pictures so maybe they can check and make sure this gets rectified for future customers, but their website is broken too. How delightful.		After the repairs the flashlight worked.. but those issues proved to me I should not trust this thing to work during a thunderstorm or in the woods during a hike. So I tossed it anyway.		I went to a big box store and looked at the same product, which oddly enough can't be found in yellow anymore, just green.. the blister pack was made much more sturdier and the batteries were different. They looked more like duracell knockoff's and the one I got from amazon had energizer looking wrappers with "heavy duty" on one side and "piussance" on the other which i'm guessing is french for you got super fooled.		Have a great day!
1,I was looking for a really heavy tarp to lay down under a tent to help reduce punctures in the tent floor on rocks and such. This tarp is the same thickness or thinner than any tarp you can find at home depot. The grommets are carelessly attached. I have not used the tarp yet, but I will be surprised if it lasts more than once camping trip.
1,It is way to wide..It won't fit in Jeans let along anything else..A total waste of money. Get one smaller. Even if it seems to be good quality.
1,Not easy to use and not very well constructed.  Knurled knob does not lock in very tight and is only good for about six inches.
1,It works but it's not reliable.
1,I never saw a timer than didn't at least have 15 minute intervals.  This came with 3 sets of "on and off" clips.  Why not include 100 clips and let us decide how many we need to use?  Walmart had heavy duty timers with 15 minute intervals (albeit not 15 amp) for $5.50.		This product worked, but only until I got the cheaper and better timers at Walmart.
1,Not bad if you have lots of time. Takes so long to boil a cup of water, you can almost forget that your waiting
1,came in a plain brown box, no packing, wrapping or instructions, installed 2 weeks ago and the color does not work anymore.  Great idea if it worked, trying to see if I can return it.
1,Had to replace one that was about 2 years old.  It started opening and closing the door at random - glad I was at home to catch it and have the internet gateway that notifies me when it does open and close.		Piss Poor support from Liftmaster who refused to replace it!	Poor design that it has a failure mode that will leave your  garage wide open for all to see.		I like the features - autoclave timer etc.
1,Me and my family have been out of town all summer I come home and open your lights and put them outside and have the Sun do their work except that did  not  work. Item is obviously defective
1,It came missing piece to connect to the drill.. sponge quality wasn't good either.. This is some kind of cheap product that you should buy from ebay.. no quality at all
1,Bulbs tend to flicker some.  One of three of the bulbs was dead on arrival.
1,Arrived looking like it has spent generations in the bottom of a toolbox...nearly black. I have not used it yet, so cannot comment on its functionality.
1,The picture shows a "female" type of plug, but what you get is a "male" type of plug. Which means it cannot be used for what the description says (connecting an LED strip to a power adaptor). The item number on the package matches the description, so I'm not sure if the description is wrong or if they made a mistake when labeling/packaging the item. The connector that you get can be used for daisy-chaining one LED strip to another, but that's not what I needed (and not what description says).
1,The screws that come with these are too short!!!!
1,Tried to install it finally today. I was unable; the hole of the sink is too small for this. The water cord cold and hot are too small in length. I was very excited to finally change the faucet in the bathroom and now I have to buy a new one. Since I took the old one off and this doesn't fit. I don't even know if it works or not. The instructions are general for different kinds of faucet.
1,OK bulb  but they come apart when they are screwed in.
1,Hung this in our store window, direct sun only til around 10:30 am and air conditioned interior. After a few weeks, the plastic melted & warped enough that the hanging screws pulled loose.  Destined for the garbage pile.  Seller was responsive in their support but I would not advise purchasing this unit to hang in any window except maybe in Canada.  Too bad, it was otherwise a nice sign.  A few pennies more in the plastics and this would be great.
1,Very poor quality control. 10% were defective.
1,Very dull and too expensive for what you get.  Color is just as in photo.
1,It was bend when it arrived, and when I was installing it, it broke.  Went to the store to buy another one.
1,The only purpose I can see for this light is to transfer money from your bank account to Nite Ize bank account.  The light is very dim, it's hard to turn on and hard to change the battery (although they do give you two extras).  I guess you could use it as a zip pull, but it's awfully expensive for that function alone.
1,It was missing a screwdriver. Overall it was a good quality set.
1,Cheap flimsy plastic, very faint light, magnifying glass cover will not close.
1,For some reason the bulb did not light. I don't know what the problem was because it seemed to make contact with the lamp.
1,Velcro would not stick to our wood frames, and the provided tacks broke off and would not go into the wood in order to hold the velcro.  Screen mesh is rather flimsy and the center magnets were not strong enough to snap together.
1,This pick up tool is just okay.  It does not pick up anyway near the 50-lb.  It is more like maybe ten pounds.
1,No, I will not buy it as there are way too many reviews that are not as the result of a "Verified Purchase". I had such a review turn sour on me once before. I did not buy this unit and have no intention of doing so.
1,I bought this to drill four holes in concrete. The holes are 3/8" x 3" deep. All holes went fine with the 1/4" pilot. The first two holes went easy with the new 3/8" bit.		The problem began at the third hole when the motor began to strain.		I unplugged it and let it cool for about 10 minutes. When I tried the four hole the power lagged and then it started throwing sparks all over me and smoking. Then the motor would only spark but gave zero drilling power.		I quickly unplugged it and it is going back to Amazon. What a piece of garbage.		I need to finish the job but am stuck with a fire hazard. Shame on Bosch/skill for such a junk product.		I bought a dewalt that has a made in USA sticker on it for about double at the blue box store and I hope this one gets the last hole drilled.
1,I was sorely disappointed with both the 1/2" wrench and the 3/8" wrench.  Both were underpowered and I was forced to go back to my old impact wrench I was using to get the bolts off my Sienna.  I immediately returned mine for a refund.  I guess you get what you pay for.
1,A piece of crap.  Just like everything made in China.  Save your money and stay away.  Or ... buy and think about this review.
1,The glue which is supposed to make it stay in place doesn't work.	So the end result is that this is a useless product  -- unless you buy your own superglue to stick it -- else tell the seller to stick it.
1,The Lock Locker doesn't deserve even 1 star & we'd give it 0 if we could. I purchased about 6 of these because it seemed like a simple solution to adding additional security to doors, particularly in college dorms. I took one out of its package & we installed it on our front door - it didn't work. The Lock Locker didn't have a strong grip on the lock. It barely connected to it. Removed it & reinstalled it on 2 other exterior doors. Didn't work on those either. Removed & gave to 3 family members - didn't work for them either on multiple types of locks that resembled those in the photos. Finally, gave it to the parent of a college student to install it in a dorm room. You guessed it - didn't work there either. We put the Lock Lockers away & forgot about them until this morning. Unfortunately, because they were ordered so long ago, Amazon won't take them back. Wish I hadn't wasted over $70 on this crap. We thought it was just our locks, but it didn't work in 4 other family member households. The connection of the Lock Locker to the door lock was useless. Save your money.
1,Trash! The die cast Zamac (junk zinc based pot metal) tensioning lever piece always breaks within a few months. Blade tension also totally sucks. I don't know why they even make this trash.
1,First noticeable attribute of this expanding screen is lack of square corners. One would think engineering a rectangle to fit inside another rectangle would necessitate a fundamental understanding of a 90 degree angle. Anyway, after that, as has been noted by other reviewers, the expanding mechanisms create roughly a 1/8th" gap. The problem is solved with large foam strips but, as this was to be removed and reinstalled repeatedly; it's a hassle.	  Thin white outline looks good, but it's a functional flop. You can still make it work despite it's problems but, for such a simple thing you really shouldn't have to.
1,SAYS THEY WILL SUPPORT 1/4" CORD; NOT SO; I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS; WASTED MY MONEY AND WILL HAVE TO BUY EITHER SMALLER CORD OR LARGER HOOKS; EITHER WAY I LOSE...
1,I posted pics.  This drill broke on day one after light use.  I pried it open, and photoed the plastic gear.  Wish the attorney general would go after Fiskars for implied warranty of merchantability.  It should be illegal to advertise this as a drill.		This is about the only option for hand drills.  Home Depot and Lowes only carry power drills - what a hassle.  A hand drill is easy to use, light weight, and takes up less space.  My local Ace Hardware only had one model - this one - so I jumped on it.		This actual hand drill is not good quality.  I used it to drill holes in the bottom of kitty litter buckets to make planters for a container garden.  Four buckets in, the gears started slipping.  I suspect it has plastic gears in the handle that stripped out.  I didn't even get much use out of it.  I got holes drilled in 6 kitty litter buckets, converted to planters, and then this hand drill was done for.  Really, for what I was doing, that's such a light job that if it does the drill in, then I can't see it making it through a single hardwood project.  I would get more holes in plastic, by using a candle to melt them, so I guess I'm back to my old ways now that the drill is totally stripped out.
1,It's inexpensive and it worked perfectly when I first installed it.....but after 5-6 months it got loud. Then it got Louder, and then ii got even LOUDER.
1,Worst product out of a 100 that I've purchased. Ordered this in 6-4-14. It's now 9-17-14.....  Nothing....  These guys truly suck.
1,Hooked it up to my hose, when I turned the water on the two pieces blew apart.
1,I set the combo, tried it several times and it worked.  Let it set for a couple of weeks in the locked position (inside my house) and tried it again.  Wouldn't open.  Now is a paperweight.
1,No retail packaging or individual boxes. No markings on the bulbs so no idea of the wattage or is 12v. The bulbs only last about 500 hours. Many were broken.
1,Great nail gun. So much handier than the ones I have to hook up to my air compressor.  After using this tool for a few months on light jobs (probably only gone through 50-100 nails) I have to say my love for this has died along with it. It will shoot nails out, but at most they only go halfway into the wood or won't shoot nails at all. Basically it's now useless. I tried to find forums to see if there was anyway to fix this, but changing settings and oiling it have not helped. Very disappointed in what I thought was going to be my favorite new power tool for a good long time, not just a few random projects and then it dies.
1,Started beeping with no water after two weeks (new batteries) Thought honeywell would be a good product DON'T BUY
1,I got them, and had someone install them, I ordered 4, and 2 work and 2 only 1/2 way light up.
1,Arghhh.  I really wanted this to work but it didn't at all.  I don't understand the good reviews at all, unless I got an old stick.  The putty was hard and, when I tried to use it, it flaked and broke off.  Thank goodness I ordered a jar of white putty at the same time.
1,I cannot get this stapler to drive any staple,  very dissapointed.
1,Underwhelmed by this. We have used Grohe products exclusively to outfit two of our bathrooms and been very impressed with the quality. That is why we ordered this and certainly didn't expect a rough-cast 90-degree pipe with a cheap plastic cover! This would be $10 from any other company instead of $80.
1,so so
1,the small wheel that aligns the size cant hold its place, so the size keeps changing making this useless
1,Started smoking first time I used it.  Amazon was great though on providing a refund.  Maybe I just got a defective one, it happens.
1,I have a pair of these kneepads.....ouch!! The straps cut into the back of my knees so bad that I have to take them off after about 45 min. Buy something else. I wish I could get my money back on these.
1,all of them broke within 2 weeks. That said, it was outdoor, in the sun and more or less exposed to salt water. The load however wasn't that much and I am greatly disappointed, especially for something stating " heavy duty".	If that is heavy duty, I surely don't want to ever come across a "regular" one.
1,Failed 1 week after installation. Wouldn't respond to the entry of codes after a few days. Very disappointing.
1,it's ok......us made much better quality....these are cheapos..
1,If your current thermostat is mounted to 2x4 inch metal electrical box, this won't work unless you buy (since they don't provide one like Nest does) an adapter.  The reason is the backing plate that the Ecobee sits on won't mount onto the box, it's too small and won't fit.  It's too bad because I really was looking forward to getting this up and running. I called customer support and they said they don't make an adapter.  So it's getting returned.
1,I was trying to do a DIY project by cutting nails off of a pallet. The videos I saw they cut through the nails with such ease. These took a lot of strength and would not recommend.
1,Yes they work but the tips on some of them resemble a saw blade instead of a smooth sharp cutting surface. I recommend spending a few extra dollars and getting a better set.
1,Bought this as a WHITE device (as pictured) but the Part Number read "GY" and the Seller was impossible to work with. Tried to make me feel like an idiot - all over a few-dollar item. It's the seller that is bad - not the product.
1,The factory Ryobi 9" saw that I have is fitted with round guide blocks. These are square and they bear no resemblance to the originals in either length or diameter. I may be able to round them in a drill press and cut them to length; but in any case, these completely useless items were entirely not what I had expected.
1,Terrible experience.  Cheaply made.  Bought faucet at Lowes yesterday evening, installed today.  Something wrong with mechanism in hot water handle for the hot water will not completely turn off.  We purchased this faucet to replace on with a slight drip, now we have a steady stream of water when we place the handle in the off position.  You have to bring the handle back to the on position ever so slightly to stop the water from running; who would want to be bothered with that after spending so much time, effort and money on a brand new item.  Also, after using the sprayer, it drip, drip, drip, drips; quite annoying.  Will def. be returning this item to Lowes.
1,Once you go buy proper wall anchors and pull your hair out mounting this it looks good.
1,The unit was DOA - as reported by others. Turns out the fuse wasn't working. Replaced with included replacement fuse and unit finally turned on. After 2 minutes, the handle started smoking, then melting in my hand and suddenly the entire metal part fell off narrowly missing my skin/flesh (the tip was firmly screwed in, but the metal heater assembly / barrel nut assembly surrounding the heating element melted right off the handle and fell off with plastic smoking all around it.) Fancy a red hot heating assembly falling off potentially causing havoc? I've been soldering for 20 years using everything from cheap to mid-priced irons, and have never seen anything like this. My entire project is now delayed until I get a replacement (from a different brand). Thanks for nothing Aoyue.
1,Hard to coil and sticks to itself.  Would be fine on a reel but rubber is much better if you hand coil it.
1,blew away after a few weeks. a neighbor brought one back to me. the ties and elastic had dried out and separated with little effort.back to my old way of using a trash bag and duct tape. over 10 years of doing that and its still the best method. i do see an impact in my heating bill too.
1,I bought a bunch of these a year ago when they were only $4. The price now is higher than Home Depot including the tax. Might as well go there to get them.		They are very nice brackets though.
1,Several of the refills were broken in small pieces when received. Too small to work in the holder. Too fragile to be shipped.
1,As stated by a handful of others the 15z does not last long at least for me when controlling fans. I've had two stop working, one just quit and the other is now on the fritz, you can hear the relay toggling, both seemed to last 12-18mos. The 500z (dimmer) and 00z (aux) switches however are fine. I suspect the relays in the 15z (on/off) are poor quality.
1,Shipping took long time.  Okay quality
1,Did not fit the appropiate width for ceiling studs. Odd size. I would not recommend. It was obvious this was returned several times.
1,6 Month later and they are failing. Have a fast flicker that is annoying. Purchased June 11 2013. Expensive if they only last 6 months.
1,The lights are hardly noticeable at night, they are so dim! Very disappointing, I purchased them to add a little light along our walkway, but they don't do a good job. I would not recommend these at all..
1,I ordered 4 of these to replace the ugly plastic faux-nickle handles on some furniture I purchased.		I had issues with 2 of the 4.  The screws simply would not thread; instead they bind and I could only get them in about 5mm.  Played musical screws thinking maybe they were slightly bent and thus the binding, but it didn't matter - one screw would work fine in one hole and the same screw wouldn't work in the fouled hole.  I had to cut the screws and deal with them just not being threaded all the way.  Luckily my purpose for these handles was more for aesthetics than function.		Other than the binding issue, they look excellent and the hole centers were pretty spot on.  2 out of 4, though.. that's just pad quality control.
1,it's nothing comparing with SENTRY Magnetic Screen Doors
1,Beautiful aesthetics, good materials and finish BUT THERE IS A CRITICAL ENGINEERING DESIGN DEFECT.  The faucet design does NOT use standard connection tubing.  Instead, it uses a fragile proprietary connector (fitting) on the faucet end of the braided connection tubing. This is bad by itself. But the real deal breaker is that this proprietary connector/fitting must be connected approx. half way up the faucet body where there is no access, no room for any tool, and no way to visual inspect the connection!!! The only way to tighten the fitting is to twist the tubing, putting the entire tubing in torsion and placing major undo stress on the tubing especially where it connects to the proprietary fitting. This is the only manufacturer that I have encountered that uses such a design.  All the major manufacturers not only use standard fittings but they make the faucet to tubing connection OUTSIDE OF THE FAUCET BODY where there is full access. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AND I WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN. Since this manufacturer uses this design in other faucets, it would avoid this manufacturer until it corrects this critical engineering flaw.
1,I love this bag!  I had various bags with tools for the different type of technical work I do. I got this bag and was able to put everything into it so I had one bag that I could bring anywhere and have every tool I needed at my side. It's very well built and very solid.  It's a great versatile bag and I would definitely recommend it.		9-1-16 --- A few months back the shoulder strap broke which really bummed me out for the amount of money I paid.  I don't believe it's overload at all. Looks similar to the picture, just you typical tools.  I still love the bag, but I carry multiple bags and for this larger bag not to have the shoulder strap option really limits things. I know it may sound nit picky, but in the field it really makes a difference. Thats why I have done this update a few month after it broke was because at first I did not think it'd matter but now, I find myself annoyed often because of it.	I will purchase a new shoulder strap, but I don't believe I should have to in such a short period of time. I'm just disappointed because this isn't a bargain bag for the money, at least I didn't think so.
1,I bought these on February 20, 2017 and just now got the chance to use them. It was horrible I have to tell you, they kept falling out over and over again, after even attempting to tighten them again and again. Which they never did tighten for whatever reason. What makes matters worse is that I am easily over 40 feet in the air trying to use them on pole lights heads, I lost two sockets to make matters worse in the snowy grass.
1,Nice gun with a few exceptions.  Mine had a driver failure within 6 months, covered under warranty but still very inconvenient.  Secondly, I have trouble driving the 2" pins all the way into hard woods. I leave the air pressure up to 100 psi but with no luck.  So that lead me to buy the Omer B6.50.  That gun has been way more reliable for me and has shot into everything with no "proud" pins.  I also really like the slight headed brads made by Omer and that is all I use now.  The holding power of these is way better than just the pins themselves.  The Grex won't shoot the brads.  The only downside of the Omer is it will only shoot down to 7/8". Not a big deal to me, but may be to some.  Plus the Grex is made in Taiwan and the Omer is make is Italy.
1,I purchased a Cree LED Bulb as they seemed everywhere at Home Depot.  It seemed to be the most like a traditional light bulb in shape.		When I bought it home I noticed that there is a huge black spot at the top, not found on any other LED bulb.  Also, the bulb itself feels like a bouncy ball a kid would get from a gumball machine--very cheesy.  The light, unlike other LED's doesn't spread light uniformly and therefore it looks odd where a lot of light may come out of one area while little comes out from another.		Then, there's the warranty which is a joke.  Cree weasels out of its warranty by making you pay at your own cost to ship it back to them in NC.  By the time you pay the return shipping and go through all the hassles of finding the receipt, packaging, etc., you could just buy a new bulb from a decent lighting company with a real warranty, like Phillips, Sylvania, GE, Utilitech, etc., not to mention Cree says it will either give you a new light bulb or try to fix the old one at Cree's discretion.  Really?  Someone is going to go through the hassle and expense of shipping a bulb back to you, find all of the packaging and you are too cheap to even give them a new bulb?		Thankfully, I returned my Cree Bulb which was more expensive, less efficient, and had poorer light quality than a Utilitech (Lowe's) bulb.  Plus, Cree is so cheap that it only makes bulbs in standard soft white (2700K) or daylight (5000k) nothing in between.  Color Rendering is also lousy at only 80 CRI compared to others that are close to 90.  Overpriced and lousy performing makes for an awful combination!
1,Bought three. Two have already failed. When they work, they are great. I just wish they would work.
1,0 star for dimmability - I have track lighting from the 90's that works with all regular bulbs. Does not work with these. This what they say "DIMMABLE  Smooth dimming capabilities from 100-20% with modern LED dimmers provides the proper look and feel to your living room, dining room and bedroom." I don't know if they are referring to the internal circuitry or to the actual dimmer. Either way, if you're going to sell to mass market as "dimmable" then spend the extra $1  for better electronics that are more compatible with already installed lighting systems. Pretty annoying.		5 stars for light quality. Really great light and similar to color temp to incandescent.		1 star for paying for dimmable, but getting what seems to be a quality non-dimmable incandescent replacement.
1,This isn't the case I received. I ordered it but received a different one. It doesn't hold the meter right so you have to remove the meter to use it.
1,First time using gloves since it finally got cold enough to use them since purchase... Working in 5 Fahrenheit air temperature, shoveling snow. Fingers started getting painfully cold after 20 minutes. Wondering if the gloves were poorly insulated or if my hands were sweating, I took the gloves off to check my hands. They were not sweaty so the gloves insulation is POOR.		When I pulled the right glove back on, the cuff tore.  When I tightened the strap, the buckle broke!  Some plastics can get brittle when very cold but this is not that cold, and a buckle on insulated gloves meant for cold weather should be made of the right plastic for very cold temps.		Looking at the tag inside the glove, it says "Made in China".  That explains a lot.  Carhartt gave up on quality and farmed their work out to another crappy Chinese factory. I am done buying Carhartt's garbage since their cold weather gloves cannot hold up in cold temps that should only be a minor challenge.
1,broke first time I used it  probably before
1,Lights were very very yellow. Did not match other 2700K LEDs in my house. Returned these lights and purchased more from another seller.
1,The Fein Multimaster is an indispensable tool. Not perfect but It is much better than any of the other brands. However, the blades are greatly overpriced. They vibrate a lot, burn the wood, can break, and dull easily. That would be OK if they were inexpensive so that you could replace them as often as needed. Can't wait until another manufacturer comes up with an inexpensive good blade. No one will buy Fein blades anymore.
1,Quantity is no substitute for quality.  I wish I'd spent my money on one or two high quality branded tools.  Depends on what kind of user you are I suppose.  To my mind, they seem very flexible and wobble a lot.  Tricky to make an accurate cut.  Professionals may be fine with them, but I am not...
1,Please avoid Kidde when considering purchasing new ionization smoke detectors. I recently purchased a home with 7 smoke detectors manufactured in 2002 (Model 1275), so in Jan 2015 they've substantially exceeded their 10 year life span. Since ionization detectors have small amounts of radioactive material, it is unwise to simply throw them away.		Calling Kidde's 800 number they quickly provided me with contact information to get an RMA to ship them to Kidde for disposal. I have been trying for over 2 weeks to complete that process. Emails to the contact number go unanswered, and voice calls go to voicemail indicating the person "Is in the office today", but evidently not returning calls. I have placed multiple emails and phone calls.		Since you can't get rid of them, I suggest avoiding Kidde alarms.
1,The cartridge I received had open package, seems to be a returned item.
1,I really like the idea of a trailer that doubles as a super-size wheelbarrow. I was able to assemble the trailer quite easily myself. However, like others, I had trouble with the dump mechanism latch - it didn't quite fit right, and I had to force it to fit. I think it will loosen up over time - and I don't think I'll use the dump feature all that often. It's easier to unhook the trailer and dump it by tipping.		My big complaint is with the packaging. The huge box was secured only with clear tape - they didn't use straps or strapping tape - and the box had fallen apart by the time it got to my house. The UPS man said the box was in pretty bad shape by the time it got to him. The smaller parts seemed to have been just thrown into the trailer body. They were supposed to be held together with zip ties, but the two ties from one bundle of parts had broken. The box should have been marked "this side up," and some sort of strapping should have been used to hold the box together. It might have helped to have wadded paper or something to pad the inside of the package - even a cardboard triangle would have helped.		The rim of the plastic trailer body had a 5-inch tear, probably caused by the unstable packaging. I guess I'll have to call the manufacturer and see what they'll do to compensate me for the damage. It seems a waste to get a whole new trailer body because I can repair the damage - but then again I think I should be compensated somehow for damaged goods. Amazon doesn't seem to accept damaged-article reports anymore. I submitted a report to Amazon about the poor packaging, but haven't heard back from them.
1,Poor locksmith was all depressed. Hours of trying to get it to work; trying different positions with the pin. It does not work as described. You need to enter the code to lock it and relick it and you have to enter the code (different codes) on either side to turn the bolt. It is not as described and if this guy couldn't figure it out, you are NOT going to figure it out. Promise. Oh, and you can't return it.
1,worked great, for one day, then went dark forever
1,This flashlight works well for what it designed to do.  Plug it in and forget about it... when the power goes out, it will automatically turn on.  The light isn't super strong or long-lasting, but it is more than adequate to get to your candles, matches, battery-operated lanterns and such.  I plan to get one for each floor of our house.		------------------------------		UPDATE: I've had this plugged into a wall socket for about 6 weeks.  It recently started faintly flickering while plugged in (it should be dark when plugged in to working outlet).  And now when I unplug it to use as a flashlight, it no longer lights up.  Complete fail.  :-(
1,this takes 6 AA. I found a longer and better one that took 3 AA
1,Bought this with semi-decent expectations. I wasn't expecting high quality by any means with the price I paid for it. I received it in the mail and didn't try to use it until about an hour ago. First off, the plug won't even stay in the socket. 2. It just sat there and smoked for about 30 minutes (which is expected with a new iron.). 3. It wouldn't even get hot enough to melt the solder. So I just took it apart to find that it was very very very cheaply made. They didn't even solder the wires together in it. They just used electrical tape which is a hazard near something that can get hot like that. I just cut the plug off, tore the electrical tape off and now I have some extra wire for something that actually works. If you haven't got the hint by now, DO NOT BUY THIS! You are more likely to burn your house down with it than use it for what it's meant to be used for.
1,I'm not sold on Bismuth / Tin solders. I'd say unless you specifically need this formula, it's better to stick with regular lead-free paste. It just doesn't seem to have the same flow and surface tension of the regular solders. It seems to go down easy (I was stenciling it) and it's good to work with in that respect, but I've spent all day tweaking temperature profiles in the reflow oven and I just can't get it to be as nice and clean as a classic lead or lead free alloy.  It has trouble wetting in to one big continuous ball of metal, and this is in spite of tweaking soak and TAL times all afternoon, and even going at it with a hot air gun. It just leaves balls behind.  It might be OK on larger pitch components, but I can say I don't trust it for 0.8mm anything.
1,This bulb lasted a little over 8 months in our kitchen ceiling.  This is why one star is generous.		When buying these, I have visions of them lasting longer than I.  Then when they fail so soon, I can't believe how stupid I am for believing the longevity claims.		They may work well in Barack's kitchen, but they sure don't in mine.
1,Used this to cut Pergo flooring material. At first it cut very well but dulled out very quickly to the point where it was burning through the material rather than cutting through it. This happened rather quickly. It performed more like a standard blade, not at all like a carbide. Would not buy again regardless of price.
1,Didnt work! Machined wrong! Go Figure.
1,the suction only worked for 6-8 hours at a time. returned
1,This new design!!!!  S%%%%%, wow! bad water filtration, the water comes out opaque!!!  plus the knob after a while it gets really hard to turn!!!	Tell the design Engineer to go back to the CAD station!!!!  so frustrated. I bought many of these in the past 10+ years! but the old design was better. Stay away from this design!!!! it really (below the line) S%%%%%.....
1,The light is way too dim. This product is absolutely useless even in complete darkness, u can barely see the light.		[This product will can cause death or serious injury!]
1,I've been carrying original PD20 daily for about a year now and overall love it.  I was excited to see the redesign and actually placed an order for one and then realized that there is no pocket clip and promptly cancelled the order. The light, while very small, is a little chunky to just be floating down in my pocket. No pocket clip ruined this light for me.  They also need to make them with a lower low output.  9 lumens is still pretty bright.  The low needs to be around 2-3 lumens or less even.  Otherwise its a great light.
1,The lens is not completely clear. It actually magnifies and distorts your vision. The defect is very obvious and makes me dizzy the moment I put it on. I'm going to return this.
1,Quit making straight cuts after less than a dozen cuts making it far more difficult for the couple project I had.	So if you are using this, plan on make several cuts to get one good cut		Projects ( 3/4 PEX ):	Installing water softener (new plumb, Tap in /w shut off)		Projects ( 1/2" PEX)	Kitchen: 2 new shutoff valves and Tee for Dishwasher.	Bathroom: 2 new shutoff valves (new Vanity install)
1,Noisey, noisey, noisey!!
1,I couldn't get any of the six to work, tried with both led and incandescent bulb.
1,Great if they do not fall
1,Works but you are in for a learning curve.  Google is your friend here as the usual useless documentation from Aeon comes with it.
1,DID NOT WORK
1,First off, cap arrived with a sticker to hold it in place. The can is relatively small. After the paint dries, it does NOT provide a chrome finish, no reflection what so ever. Looks like brushed aluminum finish and no more. Would I recommend it to others? No. Im sure there are better products out there.
1,It is impossible to get 2000 lumens out of one led Cree element . Why they allow them to market this way is beyond me. It is possibly 200 lumen at best. I will return them. Please do not buy this.
1,The small tube section above the swivel ball restricts the flow of water too much, subsequently the aerator cant get enough water flow to produce	a smooth stream unless the faucet is fully open. My original aerator works fine. I'm not sure if the aerator on my Siro swivel nozzle is faulty or not. The pull down spray function can be annoying when it pops into spray mode when you don't need it.  I will update this review with more experience using it.
1,Update to previously written review:		Now that a couple of months have passed, I really regret having bought these faucet/spigot sets for my bathrooms. As I mentioned in my original review, they show every tiny spot - unlike the brushed nickel fixture in my kitchen and fixtures in previous homes.  But I was so happy to get rid of the cheap-looking "chrome" faucets and spigots, I overlooked it. Now I'm realizing there's something about this particular brushed nickel that isn't quite right.  It is abnormally difficult to clean and to keep clean.  I should have spent a little more for a better quality product.		Original review:		I bought 4 of these to replace our cheap builder-installed "chrome" (silver-painted plastic) fixtures.  It took the plumber about 45 minutes to install each one (with the included sink stopper) - no problems whatsoever - and they look GREAT.  What a difference attractive faucets make!		I have two complaints:  #1 is they're difficult to keep clean - or should I say difficult to keep "spot-free."  I've had brushed nickel faucets/spigots in previous homes and I have another style of brushed-nickel in my kitchen, but these seem to show every tiny spot of dried water more than others.  I have to polish the fixture after every use, which is kind of a hassle, but that's the way it is with brushed nickel and similar finishes.  Anything's better than the fake chrome stuff though.		#2, there's a good bit of "play" in the faucets when you turn the water off and on.  Not a big deal though.  We asked the plumber about it, and he said that's the way they're made, and he went in to an explanation about a washer or something.  Again, not a big problem.		Mainly, they're an attractive and inexpensive way to update your bathrooms.  I'm happy I bought these.  (Since writing this review, I am NOT happy I bought these.  My apologies folks!)
1,Worked for a short while. The hair seems to still find a way to get around every single one of these. After a few weeks the white part even turned moldy and green. Try something else.
1,I thought that this light having 26 led lights would be brighter than the Deneve light that I had for the past 2 1/2 years which has only 20.  Quite the contrary.  This thing only puts out about 2/3 the light of the Deneve.  It is a smaller diameter and the lights are pointed in a more downward position then the Deneve lights which have a little more outward angle, giving more light to the flag.
1,There is no overheat protection on this thing, despite the claims! The opaque container also makes it hard to see how much water is in it. So if you let this run dry, it will keep running hot and cause a malfunction. I know because it happened to me. It actually caused the plug connected to the outlet to overheat and burn out! The wire prongs turned black and there was also some melted plastic. I was fortunate that it didn't result in a fire.		Another safety issue is with the location of the wire connection on the body. The connection is located on the rear of the unit, directly under a pressure relief valve. So if you have too much back pressure, the valve will release the extra pressure. Unfortunately the steam then condenses and drips down all over the area where the corn plugs into the body. Bad design!		There is another brand (Wagner) of this model, but it is the same unit just rebadged. Different color, but same issues.		These two safety issues are really unfortunate because otherwise this is a great unit that produces a lot of steam, almost too much for my needs. And the brass connector allows for using it for custom job (I use it to pump steam into my commercial pizza oven so I can make artisan breads).		If you do buy this (since most of the other options suck), I recommend getting a timer switch you can put between the unit and the power outlet. I make sure it's filled full with water and run it for 30 minutes with the timer. This way you limit the risk of leaving it running while dry and causing an electrical fire.
1,I only give 2 stars for the price. These are advertised as 3000k but i couldn't imagine them being any whiter. I changed other bulbs to LED and the wife didn't notice. As soon as she saw these she said they had to go. If you like white over warm you will love them. If you want anything warm i think u will be extremely disappointed like me. I paid almost 50% of the price to return them.
1,No good stop working fast and really hard to get it to shut off
1,I should have listened to the reviews that said the screws that hold the light to the knuckle connector were poorly made and designed! When you go to screw the light into a box, the head shears off! Unbelievable ! I had to go to the hardware store and by longer and stronger screws to rebuild the light. We will see how long they last. I will update. Do yourself a favor and spend more money on a much better product!!
1,Failed after 8 months of use.  No longer detects powers up.
1,container leaks like crazy. ended up trashing
1,I bought 3 of these... good thing too. One of them broke internally after 3 days. And another made a horrible clicking squeak for days before the lube could work it's way in.
1,Not to good
1,Out of 10 lights ordered, only one worked after it was hung upside down.  I suspect it was a wiring connection issue when gravity came into play.  The good news was that the company immediately and kindly refunded the purchases.
1,Vibrated heavily w their provided disk. put on a Dewalt disk and it did help mitigate the vibration.		One thing concerned me is the guard. Not sure if it was meant to be one of those adjustable ones; but no matter how much I tightened the screw to 'lock' the guard it would always shift/slip with a twist of the hand.
1,Great light if it worked more then a week. Got me and it only worked for a few days. Then it would flicker on and off when it wanted. Then it stay on and could shut it off until I took batteries out. I wish it worked bec i paid 27 dollars for it and it's good when it works.
1,I bought this torch for artistic jewelry making. The torch Ignited twice and then basically stopped igniting. When it would ignite again, the flame was too small to be useable and the flame size would not adjust. This Blazer torch is made in Japan. I am returning this defective Blazer GB2001 and exchanging it for a Messermeister FT-912 Cheflamme Culinary Torch (which can also be used for jewelry making and has a hotter flame). I will write a review on the Messermeister FT-912 after I receive it and I am able to use it.		I read in another one star review post titled "Nothing But Trouble" that the Blazer GB2001 had this same problem experienced a little over 30 days from the date of purchase...so it became defective right after the Amazon return period. I wish I would have read that review prior to making my purchase. I didn't want to chance going past the Amazon return period so that is why I'm going to exchange this torch for another make and model.		Also, I purchased 6 canisters of Blazer triple filtered butane fuel so it shouldn't be the fuel that caused the problem as replies to the "Nothing But Trouble" review have suggested (unless Blazer's fuel isn't good to use in their own torches). I also wasted at least a half of a canister of fuel trying to get this defective Blazer GB 2001 to work (I had to empty it before shipping it back to Amazon) and Amazon will not allow you to return the used and/or unused fuel canisters.
1,Not bright enough for my lamps.
1,Great look, but no info how to deploy or	how to reuse.
1,This wasn't the best piece of sound proofing tape. The adhesive came off very easily, and I will have to buy another one from a different company. It was a waste of money. I think I got a faulty product.
1,The base/trim ring that mounts to the light box is shown in the photos as being 13cm (5.1") in diameter.  The lights I received have a base of approximately 3 3/4" diameter.  A standard "old work" light box is 4 3/8" diameter, which means the pendant base won't cover a standard light box.  Very disappointing to discover this when in the middle of an install project.
1,I don't know where they get off saying this is rustproof or stainless steel.  Our has rusted so badly my wife wants to replace it (again!)  Admittedly, we live in a coastal area and maybe it wouldn't have rusted if we lived someplace like Phoenix, but it is hardly stainless steel.
1,I also tested the power consumption to see if the stated 45 Watts was accurate, after waiting for the bulb to sufficiently heat up it was under the specified wattage, specifically it was drawing 32 watts measured with a known to be good Kill-A-Watt meter. I'm definitely avoiding this brand in the future.
1,didnt match other bulbs
1,The light pattern on this is subpar and it does not produce near 60w equivalent. Other 60w equivalent LED's I've had are much brighter (although it's somewhat expected for a Canelabra bulb). This is an E12/Candelabra base to fit in specific ceiling fixtures, which is great, however it is a bit too long for several of my fixtures covers to fit on properly (make sure you measure your clearance, these bulbs are 102mm tip to tip). My biggest issue with these (I bought two packs from two different sellers/times), is they produce some weird RF interference with other items in my home / over the same circuit. I was having a problem with certain wall dimmers not working that are on the same circuit (for completely different lights, in completely different rooms) and found that with these LED bulbs on, it prevented those switches from working. Additionally I used a RF sniffer and whenever I get near these bulbs it goes off. I have probably 10 different types of LED bulbs in my house right now, and none of them set off the detector like every single one of these do.
1,This shower arm extension worked well for about three months, then it started leaking out the crease near the wingnut where you tighten the joint. While it is still functioning, the water leaking from the crease has weakened the water pressure. I can't recommend this product as I am looking a replacement shower arm extension.
1,I think it depends on what you do and on your expectations. I am ok with the design if it was executed well. It did not work for me because it's far from precision. Even if you can manage to level the router plate with the table the round inserts will be about 1/32 lower than the plate. It's almost impossible to make anything in a repeatable way. Very disappointed.
1,weak and useless
1,Not blue at all.  But if I were looking for a green bulb this would be it.  I'm not a happy camper.
1,This would be the perfect nailer and I love it when it works, unfortunately they break within 8 months of use without fail! Typically the bumper breaks down causing the driver to break.  I own 6 of these guns and currently only 2 work. I keep buying them because in spite of the inevitable failure they're still way better then any other brand! I use them daily for finish carpentry use, so I use them more than the typical person. If you're looking for something to use around the house it will probably last forever.
1,Typical knife,  Only special feature are two stubs that make the knife easy to open.  Problem is, it is TOO easy to open.  There have been multiple times when this knife has opened while wearing it on my belt. My clothes, arm, or a seat belt can catch the easy-open stubs and flip the knife open. Each time, I have felt the knife poking into my side.  I now have to keep a rubber band around the knife for safety reasons.		Other than this, it is a typical knife and likely not worth the price I paid.
1,not like the 4watt bulbs, thies don't shed much light. you can see the light itself but it doesen't illuminate the area. returning them, not as predicted. captez
1,Will be returning. This gray grunge wall didn't even look good. Also bought Center console which looked sort of cool but sadly I ended up crumpling up the mess and throwing it away. Was impossible to try to get it straight to the corner. Maybe with two people would have been easier. When I tried to peel it off and start over it stopped paint off the wall which is precisely opposite of why I got it. When I was trying to adjust it ended up sticking to itself and getting all wrinkled looking. It was taking forever to get the air bubbles out. Threw it out and painted the walll. Way easier. I gave center console two stars instead of one because if you don't care if it rips paint off the wall and you have two people to help put it up might work for you. Cool for a kids bedroom or something.
1,Item does not work well. Paint squirts everywhere causing huge messes. Id rather paint with a hand brush.
1,The individual shelves look nice and sturdy, but we were unable to put the shelves together due to the plastic pieces not fitting properly over the legs. Returning for a refund.
1,This hose recoils. That means that you have to fight against it to stretch it 5 to 10 ft. I would not recumbent it. Grat for shipping not so great to use.
1,Really?  You let this product out the door OBVIOUSLY USED - and you didn't EVEN INCLUDE A KEY!!  lol	And NO screws.  And no hardware to hold the whole thing together!		Ummmm, now what?  Should I return this?		I am sure this is just my bad luck, other people will get a lovely door knob with built in alarm AND THE KEYS to match!		I guess I will keep my other lock, for now, though...
1,I wanted to try this product because I didn't want to drill holes as required on some other models and the reviews on this were good. I'm not sure if I received a defective unit or what but the velcro wouldn't stick to the wall and I did make sure it was clean before installing the velcro. I got this so I could put it over my back door so my dogs could go in and out because the door itself is metal so didn't want to cut a doggy door and it's just the door and no screen as it is now. The bad part is my dogs (shih tzu)can go in and out but the screen doesn't go back together in the middle because the magnets aren't strong enough. I thought maybe they just weren't opening it far enough and it just needed to swing back together but that didn't work either. If you need or want the screen to come back together completely in the middle so no flys come in then this is not the solution.  I received the item mentioned above for free or at a deep discount in the hope that I would review it. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I have used personally and believe will be good for other customers as well. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.
1,I gave it away, and built the curb old school. To me, this is a waste of good money.
1,Not waterproof so can't use outdoors; bummer! I tried that and it failed before I got started with my small electric outboard motor; I had it shielded from rain too. Drok came back with it is not to be used outdoors; but I think they are missing a sizable market.
1,These are not as good as other CFL bulbs I have purchase in the past.  The base on these if pretty wide, and they are large all around - so beware of your intended use for them, they need a bit of space to be used.  Mine did not fit into a number of ceiling lights.	They are also NOT INSTANT ON, not even close.  In fact especially right out of the box it take up to 5 minutes for them to reach full brightness, which led to me initially thinking that they were defective.  Once they warmed all the way up I would say it is comparable to a 100w incandescent, however with a higher (blue-er)color temperature - which personally I prefer for many applications.  They do all seem to differ in their brightness too, again once fully warmed up.  After they are fully bright, they can be turned off and will offer instant on full brightness within a certain amount of time.  But if they've been sitting prepare to start at about half brightness and watch them buzz their way up to full power in a minute or so.	I have always had a lot of good experiences with Sylvania, but these are just not a good product - perhaps CFL technology in these larger sizes just isn't there yet.  I know I bought 60w equivalents in a "small base" variety once that where fantastic.  I just need to see if I can find that product again.
1,Just received and tried the lamp out this morning-as other reviews wrote, the lamp socket is crooked when compared to the lamp, this unfortunately makes it so when you put on the glass shade, the shade will not be flush with the part the lamp connects to. Another issue is, though the description says the lamp has 4 settings, there are actually only 2 settings-on and off.		The only plusses are that the lamp metal looks elegant and it is bright. I'm not too picky so I'll keep it, but the product itself can definitely use improvement, if not just a quality check before it's sent out.		Oh, and to those that are complaining about the size of the product-the dimensions are on the description. Make sure to read them before purchasing-they're correct.
1,This blade has never worked right for me for cutting 3/4 in plywood. That was the reason I bought it, so that I could cut the large plywood panels down to manageable size and then take them to my table saw. But, I could never get through the cut without the blade binding into a dead stop, wood burning etc. I would have to change the blade to a 40 tooth blade to finish the cut. The reason also for this blade was to reduce the tear out that a lesser toothed blade will do. And yes, the panel was properly supported/balanced to prevent sagging. The lesser toothed blade had no problem making the cut with the panel in the same configuration. So for cutting 3/4 in plywood, I would not recommend it.
1,This thing was a nightmare that had me wishing for a roller and tray again. I spent weeks looking at various brands and models, reviews, videos.. before I settled on this Graco.		It worked ok at first. Meaning, paint came out of the sprayer onto the walls...	(Note: I was wearing a high grade respirator/mask recommended for spray painting and goggles)	The spray back was the most brutal thing I've ever experienced and I has just finished spraying texture in that room the day before. (Spraying texture previously held the #1 position for nightmare renovation projects until this day). In a 11x10 room, I had to stop twice to go outside, clean my goggles and take off the mask for fresh air. On the last run, the dang machine stopped spraying with only a 1x1' section on the ceiling left. :| Ridiculous.	I would have returned it but the box was thrown away before I got a chance.	Cleaning up was messy, awful, and took forever. I felt like I was washing half the bucket down the drain when the whole reason I bought it was to save paint.	I read the instructions about 15 times before I got started and several more as I was getting it set up. This is something I was confident in doing, especially since I have experience with (can) spray paint.	I wish I could return this so much. I would consider trying a handheld sprayer but since I sunk my budget into this thing, I will never know.		I know other people have had much more favorable experiences with this device. And to those of you trying this out - good luck and godspeed.
1,SENT BACK
1,I don't know who to be mad at more, Hitachi for having two models of the same drill one with one battery and one with two batteries or this Amazon add that does not list how many batteries come with the drill.		Update: The ads has been changed since I made my review. When I made my purchase there was no mention of how many batteries come with it.
1,Rollers seemed like a great idea to quiet and smooth out our garage door opening.  I checked, and they seemed the right diameter, so I installed them on one door.  Unfortunately, the door then did not open.  It started up, but the rollers bound going around the curved track.  I measured the rollers with a micrometer, and they were slightly larger diameter, but mainly they were thicker.  When they tried to go around the curved track, they got stuck.  I returned them (which cost over $10 in postage!), and am still waiting for a credit.
1,Does not get hot enough, therma boost is only good for so many seconds and gives up.
1,Does not turn Cherry, like in the bottom photo.  This is ONLY color changing.
1,The package arrived with one side of the cardboard box broken. Very little internal buffering in packaging. The product looked fine until I tried to mount a blade on it. The guard seemed bent which prevented easy mounting. Finally I got the blade on but it cut way off.  I am not sure it was all due to a shipping problem. Wasted my time during a project and ruined a piece of plywood. Returned it of course.
1,Very small.. but also very crappy.
1,much to thin.  thought I was getting a better product.  will not buy this one again.  never met this MERV fellow.
1,This thing is really tiny, way overpriced. The Veritas and Lie-Nielsen markers are way more sturdy. The scale seems accurate but it is too expensive for being so tiny.
1,One star is because it's not 26 inches wide, it's twenty-six-AND-A-FREAKIN'-QUARTER-INCHES WIDE. And because of that, it doesn't fit on top of my toolbox. And now I have to go get a 3/4" piece of plywood cut		I don't understand how people can take measurements so lightly, especially when it's an item for people who use TOOLS and FIX and MEASURE things. Shameful.
1,5/21/17  The longer I use this thing, the less I like it. Just now, I opened the stairwell door and waited two to three seconds  no response. Half-way down the stairs it came on. The delays seem to be getting longer and I've only used it for a month.		4/22/17  This is an infrared sensor, not a motion detector. In the use for which I wanted it, to detect motion at the top of a stairwell, it performs adequately  as long as you wait for it. I had to mount it straight across the well at about knee-height as you come through the door at the top. It does not detect the door moving but has to wait until body heat can be detected which sometimes means that, if I'm in a hurry, I'm a third of the way down the stairs before it triggers the light.		I'm giving this a three-star rating because it does work and probably could work well in the proper location. I also ordered the two-pack because of the many reviews claiming a very short lifespan.
1,Used the size guide at the product description and these were too small by quite a large amount.  The pegs, just fell into the hole and I was unable to retrieve them, leaving me to place my shelf in a different position.		These run small.  Buy Bigger
1,At first it seemed great... but then mine rusted and pitted making it into a knife "DULLER" instead of a sharpener.
1,This looks good and was not very loud at first. Semi-sufficient airflow for my 7x6 ft bathroom. However after few days it developed strange noise similar to transformer buzz. That did not increase overall sound level when measured by the iPhone app, but added annoying wining  note which propagates through the joist to two bedrooms in that end of the house. When used spectrum analyzer app, found sharp peaks around 300, 600 and 900 Hz. Because installation requires it being attached to a joist, tight acoustic contact makes sound travel far. Luckily if failed within amazon return window and I promptly replaced it with Panasonic FV-08VQL6 fan at double the price which I am totally happy with now.		Another annoyance was continuous condensation on the glass; also the garbage that was shaken off the ceiling following installation would fall into the bowl and be extremely visible especially with light on. I imagine glass bowl will need to be removed and cleaned rather often to maintain good appearance. I would prefer design where light is isolated from the ventilation chamber.		On the good note it uses standard small bulb screw and finding nice warm LED bulbs is easy. Looks good too.
1,These things are cheap and you get what you pay for. The set of 8 that I just bought are already in the trash can. Might work on hardwood but they don't work on berber carpet!
1,Purchased these to hang standard C9's on my gutters, and to hold them all straight. During installation, I should have known there was going to be a problem... The clip holding the bulb barely grasped the bulb. After doing 2 levels of my house (200 lights/clips total), my wife went to move the power cord just around a post, and down came 86/100 lights... almost the entire strand popped out just like dominoes! For now, I put re-attached each bulb, but put 1 clip to hold the wire every ~5ft, so if they do come down, hopefully I don't have to re-attach more than 5 feet at a time.		The only reason for 2 stars (and not 1) is that the clips do hold onto the gutter very well, and if you just hang your lights by the wire, I'm sure these will work well for you.		Better options out there for hanging C9s.
1,It okay
1,I'm usually a Rustoleum fan but this primer was giving me issues on my projects. I'd recommend going with a different primer if you're using this on plastics.
1,Unbelievable! Total crap! I bought over 40 of these and changed out nearly all my bulbs. Less than 3 months later and I am already having to replace several. They start flickering and then a few days later completely die. Too late to return! The company actually threatens you with an insert saying NOT to return to Amazon or they will ban you as a buyer! What a joke!
1,I purchased this in January, it is now March and the bulb is failing.  I was under the impression that these bulbs were supposed to last longer, save energy and over time save money.  Well when you replace them every couple months I can assure you this is not the case.  As these bulbs also need to be recycled correctly.  I would say stay far far away from these items.
1,Again, get a shop vac, a grinder with diamond wheel to remove grout.  This is'll leave burn marks and skid marks on your adjacent tile.  Another joke of a tool for what really is a brute force job requiring the proper tools
1,I wanted to like this unit, tried it on 3 different surfaces, adjusted pressure anywhere from 60-110 but on 100 it shoots all the way into the wood and cuts through fabric. Tried on several jobs and this one goes back.
1,Ive had this knife for about a year now. After just a few months had to send it back to Kershaw due to the cheap plastic Blade lock breaking. Turn around time was very long(5weeks) but it came back super sharp and all cleaned up. Blade lock broke again shortly after however. The tip is very brittle and broke when it went through the washer on accident, not blaming Kershaw for that. Just a fe moment ago I dropped the knife from waist height and all 3 screws on the handle flew out who knows where and the knife came apart. Ive always used this knife gently and kept it clipped in my pocket every day Ive brought it to work. I don't plan on buying another Leek due to the above plus the handle is the worst you could want on a razor sharp tool, smooth, slick with no grip.
1,Have been looking for another litter disposal unit to compliment my original Litter Locker (which I love for ease of use) and saw that all the new improved ones use the same system, tall plastic can with  bags and a sliding lock piece. I was considering a diaper pail unit but they basically use the same system except one that has a fan unfortunately after contacting the company they told me there were slots in the top and if the litter fell into those it would ruin the unit.  Therefore,  I decided that I would go with Litter Locker's unit II.  So far I am not impressed.  I find it awkward to use - I put a brick in the bottom to make it a little sturdier.  I find that I have to shake the unit to make sure that all the dirty litter goes down into the unit while holding the locking piece out - this is improved?  The original LL is so easy - open, dump, close lid, turn wheel - done.  The new one; open, dump, close lid, hold unit while pulling out the locking piece and pushing down on the tab, shake unit so all stuff falls into bag - done.  I will continue to use it in hopes I will get used to the system.  I did find the unit at drugstore.com and the refills were cheaper.  I have two cats and scoop several times a day ... the refills for the original LL last quite a long time - I have had the unit for years.  I can understand using other bags, but I would not like the idea of the plastic bag hanging on the outside of the unit (if I am reading the posting correctly) but that is just my opinion and if the refill bags get discontinued at some time, I know I have options .		Last year I purchased the Litter Champ which ended in the dumpster due to the lack of odor control - the plastic soaked up the odor like a sponge, after a few weeks the whole unit stunk and made my bathroom stink too.  I am hoping that this new system will grow on me because I would hate to have to throw another "new improved" litter disposal unit out and waste more money.  It does have a nice look and the footprint isn't that big, the scoop slots are a little big and some of the smaller bits fall out on the way to the unit.  The ultimate test will be to see what my Cat Nanny thinks of this - she finds the original LL great.	April Update:	I've been using this system for several months and have gotten used to the system.  What does work is it contains odors quite well, the plastic bags do last long so I don't see a problem with the cost of the refills because you don't have to buy them that often, I have gotten rid of the scoop that came with the unit and have one with smaller slots and have eliminated the mess of litter on the floor.  Do I like it as much as the original - absolutely not, but it serves the purpose.  I also have gotten into the rhythm of dumping, closing and shaking of the unit so it isn't as awkward as in the beginning.  It contains odor which is most important and has a small footprint.
1,By far the worst product I have bought with the Gladiator logo on it. I have installed some gear tracks and gear panels in my garage and these screws are terrible. The paint is so thick it won't let the philips end of my impact drive get in properly and will inevitably strip. when the paint is not so thick, the head broke repeatedly while getting them through the studs..		I ended using some 'torks' head deck screws, and not a problem at all, all screws went it like there was nothing behind the panels and as they are green, i just dabbed a little white paint with a q-tip on these. looks great.		Mr Whirlpool, you need to get back to the drawing board. This is just not up to par.
1,Very cheaply made, and surprisingly painful to install.  The latch sticks when retracting, so you need to remember to move the handle back into position when you close the door.  There are emergency jumpers on the outside of the lock for if the battery dies.  It doesn't seem like the most secure thing to have exposed to the outside world.  Finally, this isn't a real touch screen.  It's a touch PAD.  There is a distinct difference.		For the price you will pay for this, get something else.
1,I purchased this for my Craftsman garage door openers. 2 purchased in 2003 and one door opener in 2006. It did not work on any of them even though they claim it works with a RED learning button...NOT!!!!! Really disappointed because eof the compact size would have been convenient
1,Used in a 2-stage under sink system with WFQTC30001.  The water comes out clean and clear with no odor or taste of chlorine, so it does a good job.  But it is painfully slow.  It is almost to the point where you want to set your glass down under the faucet and come back later, rather than stand there and hold it.  And that is when the filters are new.  It gets even slower as they begin to plug.		This is the 4th house in which I have installed under the cabinet filters.  These are by far the slowest.  The other filters I have used gave a micron rating, and I purchased the .05 and 1 micron filters.  I could not find the micron rating for these filters.		Again, I think they do a good job and are better than no filters, but I will not buy a DuPont filter system again because they are so slow.
1,hooked up wires and my bell rang and never stopped
1,Lamp Worked for 1week. Having replaced battery no effect. Doesn't turn on After while days exposure to sunlight. May be switch defective.
1,The minute hand did stay on, I had to glue,  And the silly thing does not keep time.	Obviously I'm pretty disappointed,
1,Too cheap
1,Had problems with leaking can upon receipt. Cost me $$ to ship the mess back for refund.	Ended up using the rustoleum tub refinishing kit sold here on Amazon which worked out OK at 1/3 the cost of this kit.
1,My husband wears gloves daily as we farm, have a heavy equipment dirt work business related to farming, and mechanic our own equipment, so gloves are used a lot.  By the third time of wearing these, the inside material fell apart and came out, but the outside stayed together so he still wears them periodically.  We have never had a pair of gloves only go through a few days of use.  There is no water proofing to these at all, just in case you where wondering.  There are much better options out there, like CAT mechanics gloves that are black with CAT in yellow across top of hand with adjustable velcro closure; they are really durable and we prefer them but decided to try something else.
1,Honestly if the switch lasted id give it a higher rating. Other issue i had was power & performance. Interestingly 1,100 watts is barely 1.5 hp. Would have added a star if they had paid to ship it back to the factory & given me less hassle about a refund. Im gonna buy a standalone combo-switch & add	my 6.5 hp Rigid and see how it goes.
1,If you just want these to go around a top hat for decorative, ok, (but be aware the center part's pretty ugly and there's a yellow stripe down the band (sharpie fixed the stripe) but if you want to wear these? Ow, the hard plastic certainly did not fit MY face at least. I ended up just tying them to my belt as decoration after painting them colors.
1,IR makes excellent socket sets.  Unfortunately, as the other reviewer stated, this one misses the most important size, 12mm.  What an oversight.
1,I get compliments about it and it's extremely easy to install. Also, prevents critters from wondering into the house on a hot summer day but it could be designed batter. The opening should be wider and the magnets should be placed in different spots.
1,Like other reviews the on/off delay is to long, this was my 2nd one and it broken after 2 weeks and I do not abuse my tools, I currently own 2 FLIR thermal cameras and I want to purchase the meter/thermal combo unit but I am a little nervous and wonder if FLIR may have wondered out of their comfort zone. In my opinion FLIR IR cameras are top of the line
1,For some reason, the repair kit was not as good as purchasing a new Danco or Moen faucet cartridge. The pulling or turnings of the handles, after installation, were just as difficult as before. And, I cleaned the metal cartridges and inside the faucets before replacing the rubber parts.  Maybe the repair kit will work for you but it didn't work for me.
1,does not fit any of my other 1/4-inch sockets.....
1,I have to agree with the other reviewers.  The bore is the correct size but the bottom is odd.  I was able to modify the bottom so that it is held in place by drilling a hole in it and using a home made clip.  This only worked for my bigger vac.  The small 3 gallon vac would not close with this filter on it.  Of course the price is better than most so, for me, it is worth is to modify the filter by cutting off the bottom dome and using a 4" diameter plate as the retainer.  If you are looking for a simple "plug and play" this is not the filter for you.
1,I purchased 2 of these units, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Install was easy, linking the units was also easy. On paper this is a wonderful solution to link detectors in existing homes without the expense of having to rewire.		I did experience a problem. The upstairs unit is wired to the same circuit as a ceiling fan which is remote control operated and has dimmable lights (built into the fan, not via light switch). The circuit path is that the smoke detector is first and then the fan and the detector is physically far away from the fan (6 feet at least from tip of blades).		When the fan is on or/and when the fan light is on the smoke detector alarm trips/sounds. After hitting the silent button and turning off the fan and/or light the alarm is cleared from the detector and it reverts to regular mode. The detector does not immediately trip, it can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 4 hours (as observed so far). I have switched the 2 detectors (upstairs detector now downstairs and downstairs detector now upstairs) and will see if the problem persists.		Other info: manufacture date of detector is July of 2014 (purchased September of 2014) so bad battery is probably not the cause as I used the batteries included in the package.		If not for the false alarms I would give this product 5 stars. If problem persists after switch I will update my review to 2 stars as it would essentially render my fan and lights unusable.		UPDATE:	I removed the 1st detector mentioned above but still have a 2nd one downstairs. Also I have a 3way light switch with dimmer but this is not on the same circuit or located anywhere near this detector, I have no idea if this is related or not. This detector has consistently giving false alarms once or twice every week at random times. I had to remove it and replaced it with a BRK 3120B which solved the problem.		I do not recommend this alarm at all! 2 of these detectors have set me back over $100 and they are useless to me.
1,I was able to use this product just a few times before twisting the blade too far and needed to replace the blade... this was my fault. When changing the blade the clip that holds the blade just broke in half. Now the coping saw is completely useless. This was not my fault.		I am very disappointed in this product and will not be buying this coping saw ever again. My dad has had the same coping saw for 15 years and I didn't even have mine for 3 months before it broke.
1,I have had an older Ana Bath shower head that I really loved, it had good water pressure.  I thought with time the quality of the shower heads would improve.  Not so, the spray choices on this one are limited.  You can either have a forceful stream out of the center circular holes...so a narrow stream of water.  Or you can have a lighter spray from the perimeter of the shower head in a circle, which is a wider stream, but nothing is coming out of the center holes..so it's not a good feeling at all, light spray and not much water and nothing in the center.  The 3 choices in-between are all not strong enough to wash the shampoo out of my very thin hair.  The old one has a rain-type setting where all the holes have water coming out at a decent pressure.  Disappointed, even with the flow restrictors removed.  Did not return because I didn't realize this until the handyman had installed it and left.  Since both shower heads on this are identical, the second arm doesn't add much more functionality, especially on the relatively short hose...it barely reaches low enough to spray my large dog's underbelly.  So I have it set on the narrow but more forceful stream and miss my old shower head.  I will be replacing this soon.
1,This seems to move a greater volume of air than a normal blow gun but at lower velocity. It also creates a less focused stream of air than the normal blow guns I buy. That makes sense when you think about the fact that the venturi is adding air but not energy to the system. This might g be better for some situations or worse for others. The real problem is the ear destroying sound it produces. A normal blow gun is very loud and should be used with ear protection but I often use it in small amounts without protection. This blow gun demands ear protection for any use in my opinion. In my opinion this tool offers little if any benefit at the cost of convenience over a well made gun without a venturi. It does seem well made and it looks kind of neat.
1,The original bulb lasted for 8 years. We have gone through 4 of these in 7 months. Pay up and get better quality.
1,This is a novelty item only... it is not of high enough quality to be useful. Neither the saw nor the knife could cut toast. The bottle opener is OK. I don't know if this is the original item or not, bit t looks and feels like a cheap knockoff. Get one of those keychain tools instead.
1,Garbage. Battery was used a few times, then refused to charge. Charger doesnt recognize it. Initially, I could get a voltage reading of about 3V. Now nothing. Thats 3V off of 5 18650 Lithium Ion cells in series, so it shouldnt drop below 15v.
1,Idea is great if apartment where changing locks all the time. Negative is if someone had key and paperclip, could re-key any of these locks in seconds! To many moving parts inside. Had one on my cabin in mountains. Felt small click when putting key in to lock. When returning, key would not go in slot! Was dead Winter, during Blizzard, 30 below and wind on top of that. Always kept lock lubed with Silicone all year. Something about that "click" last time locked sent a warning! Had to frantic call locksmith 1 1/2 hr away, was getting dark in Montana mountains! Cost time and travel time from only locksmith willing to travel under conditions! Cost almost $150.00 for that! Had to drill lock and dismantle lock for access. Then had to plug lock hole with towel all night! Very costly experience I must say. Looked at drilled lock after removal and yes, many many moving parts. Which any could fail at any moment, especially the plastic ones!
1,The end of this are thick Pieces of wood that are too thick to fit In a normal screen Area.
1,It's the size of a quarter.		Literally.		This should be pictured next to a quarter.		Absolute waste of money.
1,the lock glitches sometimes and leaves me standing outside my door looking like a thief trying to break in. i have to wait several minutes until it resets and i can enter my code.		ALSO be aware that you will have to purchase another product to make the lock work with wifi. the description makes it seem like they send you everything you need. but you need to purchase a router or something separately  which cost another $50-$100 very disappointed when i trying to hook it up to my wifi only to find out I will need to spend alot more money. might as well just buy a normal lock.
1,Purchased this closer in May, it is a rusted mess now and the shaft has broken in half.  Our gate gets a lot of use so I bought this because they claim its heavy duty, but I had light duty screen door closures on my gate that lasted longer than this.
1,blades sent were not as pictured with the open attachment ends. Received closed end types with would make changing blades on my dewalt a real pain and time consuming being that I would have to disassemble the head each time rather than just pressing the quick release. Back you go....
1,I picked these up while I was living in a shoddy area in Paris, in a building run by Hare Krishna monks.  They always were chanting or banging horse skin drums so I couldn't get any work done or sleep.		These ear muffs were recommended to me by a nearly deaf French turnip farmer.		Worthless garbage.  They are awkward when opening, as they keep wanting to close back up.  They are made of cheap junk, and very tight for average skulls.		The ear muffs are so thin, NRR 31 is definately wrong, I could hear everything with these.  More like NRR 15.  Good for people who have quiet cats walking around, not much else.  Avoid the positive reviews posted by employees of the company.		Howard Leight R-03318 Leightning L3 Premium Earmuff is the better choice.
1,This heater from Delonghi stopped functioning on the same season I purchased as new. I know how to operate a heater, and did not abuse the machine, but it simply quit working on one day.	  Though the heater was on a limited warranty for 1 year, the service location to send the heater was distant and cost some expense when shipped via postal mail or in delivered person.	  Delonghi told me that it will send a new heater as a replacement. This took more than a month. What was more abhorrent was that the new heater was a cheaper, lesser performing one. As a matter of fact, that crappy heater was broken in less than a year as well, and I had to wait on this despicable customer service again to get a new one.	  It resulted that I had to change through 3 heaters in less than a year due to Delonghi's dreadfully poor product quality. Its limited 1-year warranty saved me some dollars, but after experiencing all these problems with its product quality, I will NEVER buy again from Delonghi.	  Delonghi actually sent me an advertisement to buy an extended warranty when it shipped me the new heater, but I have no God-forsaken intention to give them a single cent after knowing that kind of heaters it makes.
1,If your parents live in stormy areas or in low-priority neighborhoods (in terms of service during power outages) this is the flashlight to get them. I will start with the main con:		- User friendliness. Only one button is used to control the on/off feature with alternating brightness. Click once for max brightness. If you click and hold, you can then cycle how bright you want the light. Much less friendly than the adjustment ring of the SRT6.		That was the only con. Once you learn how to use it (which granted it's in the user manual, but who reads them??) you're golden. Let's see why this is very friendly towards your folks:		* AA batteries. Cheap, plentiful. Sure, it takes four, but the battery life is insane. And it's not very heavy.	* Big grip base. The flashlight is easy to find, and it can be stood on the tail cap to diffuse light off the ceiling. Easily lights up an entire room like day.	* Flashing LED on the side for easy finding in the dark.	* Sturdy waterproof construction. Drop it in a tub, no problem. Drive over it in a car, who cares?	* No strobe/SOS functions. I don't want to give my folks a seizure. And I hope you don't either.	* BRIGHT. This light outclasses anything my parents currently own. It's lighter, more compact, more powerful and lasts a long time.		[UPDATE 11/11/14]		I came home one day to visit my parents after a recent storm. Saw my parents had left this unit in the drawer. Upon asking why, they showed me the inside compartment- two of the batteries had corroded, jamming them in their respective slots. I tried many ways to pry the batteries out, but alas- they're basically cemented inside of the flashlight now. Two came out fine, but the way the interior is milled, the batteries may as well be in a tube with no way to pull them out.		So instead of having gotten my parents a flashlight they could rely on, I ended up getting them a paperweight. I will try to RMA the light, but I see that you have to jump through ridiculous and expensive hoops to get any service done on them.
1,Love the concept, however the bulb didn't last more than a few months. It also turned off quickly...would prefer if it remained on for at least 30-60 seconds.
1,so i bought two of these lights, and the layout of the led's is not the same as the picture. the blue and white are in the rows as they show but the other blue's sprinkled with the orange and red's are not laid out that way. also one one light, i noticed in a row of blue and white, that one rogue red is out of place. i have one over parsley and it's doing well; the other is behind my 55 inch tv as backlighting and adds a nice glow to the living room. the other square led lights i ordered for a client are way brighter but cost 128 or so. out of 9, one was bad, so a 10 percent failure rate. these two are working fine but i will run them longer before i order 6 more for my veggie garden....
1,ok
1,The trolls at Amazon wouldn't let me post a critical review of this piece of junk so let me state that this is greatest invention since the Gutenberg Press. I don't know how I lived without it. In fact, I'm going to order one for each hand. I'll name them Frick and Frack.
1,The tray fits over my Werner ladder, but none of the paint liners from big box stores fits this item.  I tried 3 different size/brand liners and none fit!
1,My friend has an earlier model of this drill and I really fell in love with it while doing a bathroom remodel, so I decided to order the updated model (LXFD01CW).		My drill came today and when I tested it with 3 brand new drill bits I did in fact notice a wobble in the chuck like a few other of the reviewers had noticed.  Its a small wobble but definitely noticeable and INEXCUSABLE on a $200 dollar drill.		I am going to take a chance and send it back to AMAZON and see if I can get a replacement.		I will update when I get the replacement.		**UPDATE**		Received my replacement drill hoping the wobble issue would be solved....not the case.  I tried MANY different drill bits however my replacement drill had the same annoying wobble as the first one.  Its not a HUGE wobble but enough to notice and shouldn't happen on a $200 dollar drill.		Here is what I really like about the drill:		Weight...it is very light with very good torque	Grip...this drill feels wonderful in your hand...very balanced and very comfortable	Belt Clip...nice feature	Battery...very fast charge time (15 minute) however I'm not sure how long a charge would last.	Looks...over all this is a very good looking tool.		So...with all that said, I am going to return this drill and most likely go with a Bosch or DeWalt (probably a Bosch).		I hope this review helped and welcome any comments.
1,I had 3 apartments to paint and usually only have a 1-2 hours to spare each session.  I do enjoy painting and I initially thought It's was a good idea to save money on paint tray liners.  What ends up happening is that you spend a lot of time scrapping paint off.  I ended up wrapping it with aluminum foil and tape instead of using a paint tray liner.		As a tray this might be usable with a 7-inch roller but if you are using a 9-inch it isn't comfortably wide enough with some frames (like the Wooster Brush R017-9, the roller is a tight fit) and isn't deep enough and i find myself manually using a brush a lot to apply the paint onto the roller.		My next paint tray would be meant for 11-inch rollers and deeper.
1,Tried to use it to seal the leak of my pool pump, but still leaking.  Waited 3 days to make it's completely dry.
1,The Lens I received was full of scratches, even after trying to remove them it was not clear. Currently not using it.
1,So disappointed. The bulb does not look as pictured at all - instead of multiple lighted filaments, there are just two little parallel filaments that light up. It doesn't have the vintage edison bulb look whatsoever. Also doesn't work with my dimmer so it's either on or off. Really not what I was expecting and does not add anything to my open light fixture.
1,Plastic is not UV tolerant.  The whole hinge and latch needed to keep it closed fell off after 2 months in the sun.
1,This thermostat does not work with systems that need to turn on both the furnace and the fan at the same time.  I have a boiler that heats water that runs through coils to head forced air and it does not work.  My 10 year old set-back thermometer worked fine but after hours of work, a replacement unit sent by Smarthome and a visit from an HVAC tech, it was clear that when this unit calls for heat, it does not enable the fan and there is no option to control this.  I have seen an option for this in other smart thermostats.  It looks like the solution is to have a special controller installed downstairs or buy a better thermostat.		On the plus side, it worked great during the summer.		If you have a Smarthome hub, you might expect to be able to program the thermostat schedule but you can't.
1,didn't like it
1,Thought these had a sticky back, but don't.  I have no idea what they are used for and I threw them out.
1,Giving 2 starts because I selected the brown lights but was sent 2 white lights. As for the light, it is great.
1,Mine came with a serious centering problem.  It was so bad, that the metal was grinding against the liners inside.  I returned this and bought the CQC 9k - which is substantially larger, but came with perfect centering and lockup.
1,Some of pliers are still holding strong but most were damaged immediately.
1,The groove in the inside is too small/thin to actually hold a chisel properly, so it holds the chisel at a slightly cocked angle.  I am going to attempt to file it bigger, but that simply should be be necessary.
1,I tried the demo at the local Toto outlet. Fantastic experience is almost like sex! Anyway does anyone know if Medicare covers this? I have severe stabbing back pains. Just flexing my back sittimg on the toilet will ruin my emtire day. LMK. Hate to think I will pay $1000 for.a toilet seat. For.now I just get up and stand in the shower.stall. I use my hand-held.shower.head and.wash with my finger. Then I.wipe with a washcloth. Simple.and costs nothing. will get it if it gets covered or pay for one when I reach 80.
1,Returned,, Trash
1,installed in a gray pvc box with water tight cover located under the roof. stopped working in less than a month.
1,After one month the plastic part that holds the shower head and connects it to the water supply is broken. This part looks like metal but is plastic and will not last simply because it is not strong enough to support the weight of the metal shower head. Without this part the only option is to connect the hose directly to the pipe coming out from the wall. My guess is the manufacturer is trying to save a few cents by using plastic instead of metal. I found a replacement part at Home Depot (also plastic) for $8.00 and now the shower is back in business. I would not recommend this shower head.
1,1st - Read my numerous reviews of DeWalt products. You'd think I get paid to write reviews for them. When DeWalt comes out with a new tool I am usually one of the first to buy it. I hate cheaply / poorly made tools. I own 11 of their 20 Volt Max tools that I use daily as a carpenter / handyman. I also have a couple older 18volt tools that were buried in the garage after the batteries died. When the DCA1820 was finally released I bought one in hopes of giving new life to my old tools, especially my DeWalt vacuum. For the first time.... I am not a happy camper. DeWalt had a chance to hit a homerun but I feel they struck out with this adapter. IT WILL NOT FIT MANY OF THE OLD 18 VOLT TOOLS. I have emailed DeWalt a couple times trying to get a clear answer as to exactly what tools this adapter was designed to work with but the replies I get always refer me to their website which has a dead link. It seems that DeWalt themselves has no idea what tools this adapter fits. I finally sent an email to another division of DeWalt and got a reply back from Black & Decker???? Parent Company??? And they assured me that this adapter was tested on the 18 volt vacuum and will work in my DeWalt 18 volt vacuum but I am 100% sure it does not fit. The (male) part of the adapter that is supposed to slide into the opening where an 18 volt battery fits has so many tabs and ribs it greatly limits the number of tools that will accept the adapter. Why DeWalt chose to mold these useless tabs and ribs into the design is mind boggling. Why would you make a product that is useless to 50% of your intended customer base? COMPLETE LACK OF EFFORT BY PRODUCT QUALITY CONTROL AND TOTAL SCREW UP BY THE R&D TEAM. I EXPECT MORE FROM A WORLD CLASS ENTITY LIKE DEWALT. The only reason I didn't send it back -- I will attempt to fix the issue of too many tabs and ribs -- and post my result later.
1,I've installed three Kwickset smart key devices.		Two re keyed without difficulty, this one did not.		The outside half of this double deadbolt re keyed as it should.		The inside half did not.		Call to customer service resulted in offer to send out new cylinder for inside half of lock.		I would be reluctant to buy a smart key device again.		I might buy again, but only if I could not get a hardware store to key a standard unit for me.
1,Very disappointed. Switch lasted less than a week. Says it will handle 200W, but couldn't handle a 9W CF bulb. Returned.
1,not clear that it only works with sanding components. don't get if your want to exhaust cutting dust!!
1,I can't fathom why these testers, many of the same item with different brand names, get good reviews. They are accurate only in the sense that they indicate a new battery is charged. As for degree of charge remaining on a battery, these devices are VERY INACCURATE!
1,I purchased a year ago under the premise of buying a name brand. After finally using it a year later for the 1st time with less than 1000 brads fired the gun fails to shoot with no evidence of a jamb or any other malfunction. As with all my tools it's been treated with TLC. I opted to replace it out of warranty with a Harbor Freight model costing 1/4 the price. My 1st and last purchase of Bostitch brand - Very disappointed
1,Ill let my pictures speak for themselves.
1,It gets caught on everything, its stiff, and they are over priced for a glorified bungy cord with a cheap carabiner. if you need this for small tools like pliers wrench multi tool exc... id go with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/5-X-Stainless-Steel-DIY-Coil-Lanyard-Spring-Lanyard-Tool-Lanyard-Coil-Tether/dp/B01D8O1JTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">5 X Stainless Steel DIY Coil Lanyard Spring Lanyard Tool Lanyard Coil Tether</a>&nbsp;instead. but if you need something to hold a hammer, podger, impact driver, i would take a look at https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RX302XM/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=2IN3JBSLFF6E1&coliid=IKR7EJGBOGMAO&psc=1 which is a thicker gauge aircraft cable. there was a seller of the ergodyne aircraft cable lanyards but i haven't seen them on amazon in a little while, they are also over priced, but are much thicker guage and high vis, and rated. but are a bit more cumbersome.

1,Piece of junk didn't work since it was installed.  It does the single flash as if it learned, but will not show up in the app, then errors.  Also when the light is turned on for more then a min, you have to press the switch on before turning the light off or else the light will not turn off and is unresponsive.  Does not work as a remote light nor as a proper switch.  Complete piece of junk.. Hope it is limited to this single unit, but mine was a waste of money...
1,Poor light quality and color
1,I was expecting a little more from these.  They are not horrible, just not what I wanted for cutting small wire to make metal trellis for climbing plants.  I am still looking for that perfect tool...
1,Bought two - one broke within a week. The other is still going strong.
1,very cheaply made,ends break off.
1,Lasted 35 days.  You will receive more satisfaction using a twenty dollar bill to light your barbeque.
1,Needs option to adjust wifi power output. This device puts out WAY too much signal strength. This puts out more power than my wireless router.
1,I don't have an issue with the bits as they are standard bits and the same as you will find in a Black and Decker box.. The little storage container looks convenient but is worthless. It  is almost impossible to put a  driver back in the slot once you remove it. There may be some trick to it but I can't figure it out. Very frustrating. Won't but again.
1,maybe it is just me but I have a Zwave system in my house and have tried to make this remote work on it.  I have had it for some time now and every so often I get it out and try again.  I even called GE and they were no help.  Mostly told me I should have purchased the more expensive one with the display.  The more expensive one is essentially the same thing but has the dispaly and I am not going to make the same mistake twice.  I have good control with my smart phone but wanted this so other people could control lights in the house.  Don't buy this.  It is impossible to set up and the tech support is no help.
1,doesn't work very well, sound awful
1,It works... set up/programming was not difficult for my Genie garage door opener.  I have to be right in front of the garage however for it to work... literally just a few feet away.  So it's ok, but I'm guessing there are better options out there .
1,Air regulator failed.  Cut-off valve failed.  Check valve doesn't seem to vent.
1,I got a couple of these bulbs because I wanted something more powerful than the 85W ones that my CFL light kit came with.  These lights just aren't as bright as the 85W bulbs.  I did as much research as I could and about lumens and light output, and on paper these are supposed to be brighter.  In practice, however I had to use 2 of these lights to get the same output as one of the 85W bulbs.
1,I just bought one of these.  For the first day or two, it worked as others describe.  I had it in a walk-in closet.  When I entered, it would turn on from six feet away and remain on for perhaps 10 or 20 seconds (I forget exactly) after I left or stopped moving.		But now something has gone wrong.  I have to move within less than a half inch of the bottom to turn it on, and it stays on for less than two (2) seconds after I stop moving.		Others seem to like it, so I guess I'll order a second.  Hopefully I just got a bad one.  It's not worth returning the first one.
1,who thought it was possible to be unhappy w a flashlight?		 i have this mounted on my 500 so it gets turned on maybe once a month for 2 minutes. but even without being used the batteries die about every 3 or 4 months. not sure how the batteries get drained when the thing is off and it pretty much defeats the purpose. plus. it's kind of pain to change the batteries too ... hard to get the cap off when mounted.		two stars instead of one because it looks cool. not recommended.
1,I BOUGHT A BRAND NEW DW715 SAW ON AMAZON AND THIS POS LIGHT. IT DOES NOT FIT!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!	NOW I NEED TO RETURN AN OPEN PACKAGE TO AMAZON AND SEE HOW MUCH MONEY I LOSE ON RETURN SHIPPING, ETC.	FOCK AMAZON AND DEWALT!
1,Bought this setup (direct from Wiha) because it had this ratchet. Used it to tighten screws on the inside top of ped drawers on 45 units. (The mobile ped drawers each had a cover on top that used machine screws into grommet. All I had to do was tighten the two front screws) I used the ratchet with a standard 1/4" #3 apex Phillips bit.	Nice that the ratchet accepts a 1/4" bit instead of needing an adapter.	Bad that the ratchet kept reversing and slipping into neutral again and again. With so many units to tighten I had the time to study if it was my fingers accidentally hitting the lever. It was not my fingers causing the issue.	I believe it has a bad tooth and hangs up on that tooth.	Not the German engineering I paid dearly for.
1,I didn't expect much, was still underwhelmed.  I put electrical tape over the holes up front to get a little more torque; but in all...if it's not just "buffing" or some REALLY light routing or drilling...pass on this.
1,The Whip 'N Skip is fun for kids but it's build quality is lacking.	The band that goes around the leg seams to need to be repaired much to often.	If the band that goes around the leg were stronger and/or made of a different material it would be better.
1,I am on my third one in 4 years, they randomly stop working.  I now buy 2 at a time, so I have one on hand when it breaks, that way I can still use my garage door opener.
1,This is the first toolkit we have ever brought, and we were very unhappy with it.  Upon receiving the item, we discovered that the case is sealed closed with a screw, and the screwdriver we needed in order to open the case was sealed inside said case.  Hm.  Not exactly off to a good start, but lucky we were able to find someone with a spare screwdriver and proceeded without too much fuss.		The case is okay as a very basic tool set; we haven't used it enough to comment on the quality of the actual tools.  We really dislike the design of the case though - the tools do NOT stay in their place, so opening the case tends to leave them spilling out all over the place.  Closing the case (and managing to get everything to stay in its place long enough so you can actually do so) is somewhat difficult and frustrating.  Again, it seems that very poor design and little thought went into this case.		We also found that the selection of tools was very limiting and the case sometimes did not contain the right tool for simple tasks that we would have expected it to contain.		Overall, I wish we had brought something else.  Based on the very good reviews for this product, we are very disappointed by it.
1,When I got this out of the box I thought "this is pretty neat" and I started looking for the two batteries.  For a while I was confused until I realized that there was only one battery and it was built into the tool.  Only having one battery is a big negative because it means you have to down tools every time your battery runs down or is not charged.  Having a built-in battery is another negative because it means you can't even buy a second battery to swap with the first one.  Maybe in the manufacturer's eyes it says "Our tools are so good that you never have to replace the battery.  In my eyes it says "expect to throw me away when the battery dies".	The actual tool switches from a rotating motion for impact-driving to a reciprocating motion for hammering by flipping a switch on the top of the tool.  You insert the small (easy to lose) hammer attachment into the collet and you're ready to hammer.  I will say this, you may find this to be an indispensable tool if you need to hammer in a confined space where there is not enough room to swing the hammer back.  Instead, the tool will hammer in the nail with a million mechanize mini-taps.  Beyond that, it really won't cut it as a substitute for a real hammer.  It doesn't have enough power to be a real hammer - maybe half a hammer.	As a drill/driver, my eyes brightened up when I saw the accessories kit with all the various driver bits. But there were no drill bits and I'd have to do some serious thinking to figure out where to get drill bits that would fit in this tool.  I love the impact drill/drivers I already have - my Makita and my Porter-Cable - both capable full-powered battery powered (with a spare battery) units.  Again, this seems like half of what an impact drill/driver could or should be.  As another reviewer mentioned, a box to stash all the accessory bits in (including the easy to lose hammer bit) would have been nice.	UPDATE	I did discover a place on the tool to stash the easy to lose hammer bit.  It's really a shame that this bit is not magnetic as it would make using the hammer in tight places would be a lot easier.  Then again, the performance as a hammer is really poor.  I tried to knock a tiny nail (not much bigger than a panel pin) into a piece of molding.  After much hammering, the nail was only a third of the way in.  I think I'd die of old age before it was completely in.
1,Did not stay on for more than 2 seconds after charging 24 hours
1,Don't bother, this thing is so cheap (and thick), no one will carry it around.  The compass doesn't work.  That tiny bottle opener is worthless.  If you took the useful parts of this item (the knife, tweezers, and magnifying glass) and put them on a keychain, it would be about 1/3 the size.
1,I've only used this a couple of times for miter cuts and it is difficult to maneuver with my Dremel Saw because of the way it is formed. It needs to be longer on each corner and in the center channel.
1,The tools seem to be of fair quality which is what I expected. My problem was that 40% of the 201 pieces were small drive bits of every shape and size. You would think they would have included a screwdriver handle adapter to hold the tips. Apparently they figured you could use a ratched , collet and an extension to drive them. Typical chinese thinking.  I would have returned it but I tore the lable on the tip trying to take it off. Do Not Buy
1,I returned it.  It was defective.
1,Flashlight may be fantastic, I know XM-L T6 Chips are great.  But I ordered it 2 weeks ago and its not coming for another month.		There should be giant red letters telling something will take a month and a half to get...
1,It's made of clearly cheap materials, the fitting of the removable head to its mount is sloppy and loose.  I have no expectation of this lasting more then a full year, two at the most.	The stream, however, is nice.....	Update:  the piece of Chinese garbage broke in under one year of normal usage in a two person household.
1,a piece of junk
1,Does not work. Installed EXACTLY as the diagram and like 3 YouTube videos indicated and it does not work.  I bought another one locally and same thing.  Regular old light switch works just fine.  Different brand of smart switch that ISN'T Z-Wave works just fine too.  These GE switches are junk.  It's going back, and the one I bought locally is going back.
1,Plastic and will not holdup for a long time for sure.	update 5/26/2016- This junk just broke today- DO NOT BUY! The so called pipe ripped and the the rubber tube inside ripped. TRASH!!!	DO NOT BUY!
1,Junk.  Didn't last a week.
1,I bought this unit online without ever seeing one in person.  As soon as I picked up the package, I knew I has made a mistake.  I did not realize from looking at it on the Internet how big and heavy it would be.  It is enormous and extremely heavy because it uses a sealed lead acid battery (SLA) (like a car battery).  My wife said it was too heavy and she wouldn't be able to get her hand around it.  I returned it without ever opening the blister pack packaging.		I believe that the product data on Amazon is incorrect as far as weight goes.  The weight is listed as 2.2 lbs.  It is much heavier than that.  Look at the shipping weight of 4.6 lbs.  It is packed in a plastic blister pack which weighs almost nothing and the two charger cords are also very light weight.  The unit has to be at least 4.2 pounds.		I ended up purchasing a Stanley FL5W10 which I also reviewed.
1,I loved this product for the first month before it shorted out and stopped working.  It was easy to install and worked great at first then less than a month after installing it it shorted out and I had to remove it.  I will not be buying another one of these and will have to resort to being slightly less lazy and turning my fan and light on by reaching above my head.
1,Not a good set of drill bits at all	The bit kept on still and the quarter inch shank	Was just spinning,not good on the manufacturing end????
1,There is a YouTube video by a fellow who applies this product to a window in a garage or outbuilding. I strongly suggest that you find and look at that before purchasing this. His result -- though he was apparently happy with it -- looks like what I obtained. The frosted effect is not perfectly even across the glass, it is instead blotchy and follows the spray pattern. I am not a newbie at painting and I followed the instructions found on the can and on the internet: keep the can a constant 10-12 inches from the glass, spray smoothly across, spray beyond the edge of the glass, etc. Repeated coats of the product do not remove the blotchiness.		If that's a result you're content with then this product will achieve it though keep in mind that, as with any painting job, the masking takes by far the most time and trouble and the painting is the easy part. But if you want to make a pane of clear glass actually look like frosted glass then the window film products are the way to go. In the long run they are not harder or more time-consuming to apply, especially since an internet search will find one or more companies that will pre-cut the film to your measurements.		The Rust-Oleum product can, by the way, be removed with window-cleaner and a rag; it takes some scrubbing but is safer for surrounding painted surfaces, and much less smelly, than using acetone or an acetone-based paint remover.
1,This dims LED's only part way.....barely noticeable.
1,These bend away from self tapping screws. They're OK for flex duct to flex duct connections (that don't use screws)
1,Because I was in a hurry, I bought a 4 pack of these bulbs in a big box store and they are going back for a refund.  I only tried one bulb and it went snap-crackle-pop.  After it stopped flashing it stayed lit but with a slight flicker.  I just want a steady light, not a light show.  Maybe I should buy more LED lights.
1,Purchased in November of 2017 stopped working in May of 2018
1,This is a good light but I take off 1 star because of the lack of a tactical switch and when it is dark it is near impossible to feel for the switch.  I take off 1 other star because you can't use other 18650 rechargeable batteries and I know that it is possible to do so as I have used many in fenix products.  I take off the last star for failing to advertise the fact that you can not use other than OLIGHT batteries and that is just sad.  If they had advertised clearly this fact I would not have purchased the light or if I did would have purchased a few OLIGHT batteries.		So other than those reasons the light is great and at 1 lumen it lasted for 36 days (that is not a typo).  I kept it stuck to my fridge as a night light for 36 days with it on 24x7.  Insane.		Good build great charging but needs to be designed to use or at least warn you that it needs to use only OLIGHT 18650 batteries.
1,I made the purchase of two. When it arrived I opened the package only to note that the glass was broken. I was very disappointed. You pay for what you get. I didn't return them because it was not worth my time. So if you make a purchase from here just know. The packaging is poor and also quality. Just beware
1,Total BS. I have 3 of these in my cart and in less than 5min from checkout it deleted 1 of the 3, and jacks up the price from 19.99 to 27.56. Starting to think they have a computer running in the background and when enough people buy an item, it jacks up the price. Unfair trade practice if you ask me.
1,I am a painter for more than 20 years. It is the worst scrape I have bought until now. I do not have time to return it!	Disappointed.
1,I should have spent the money and ordered the higher level product from Work Sharp
1,I installed six of these recessed lights in my kitchen area. 10 minutes later I was pulling them all out and putting back the original incandescent bulbs. These G7 LED lights put out a very harsh white light. They make food on the kitchen table and skintones look very unappealing. Unfortunately, it's going to be a very long time before anyone comes up with a good alternative to an incandescent bulb. Incandescent bulbs put out a very warm natural light that is very hard to duplicate.	I'm lucky enough to have solar panels on the roof of my house so I'm not concerned with the extra electricity that incandescent bulbs use.	I would describe G7 LED bulbs as being great for industrial use but not for the home. Use them in your garage or work area and you'll be happy with the bright white fluorescent style light.		These G7 LED lightbulbs also claim to be dimmable. Unfortunately they do not work with all dimming switches. If you have a dimmer switch that has a slide toggle then these lights will dim. If you have a dimmer switch that operates by touching and holding then these G7 lights will not work properly. They do not completely shut off, they remain on the lowest setting and cannot be turned off completely.
1,GREAT light (when it works).		It is advertised as having a "limited lifetime warranty", but the switch and electronics are excluded. That means the case has a lifetime warranty. The switch and electronics have a two year warranty (with proof of purchase.)		Buy three. When #1 quits, (and it will), pull out your spare (#2). Send the bad one (#1) back to Streamlight for warranty service, and carry #3 as a spare. When it fails, pull out the new one they sent you and repeat the process when it fails.		That way you will always have at least one of these that works for you when you need it, and a spare for when it fails.		 And yes, you will be repeating this. I work nights, so I have a lot of experience with this.		This means you pay $21 annually. If you are OK with the expense and the hassle, this is a good purchase.		At the end of the two year warranty, buy a new one after the next failure and start over.		Of course, if the case fails, there is the "lifetime" warranty. How does a case fail?		If it were reliable, and really did have an honest-to-God lifetime warranty, it would get five stars. It is a great light when it feels like working.
1,Charger/batteries crap; won't charge.  Won't replace either.
1,They did not fit into my socket.
1,Wear thin fast!
1,didn't work that well
1,Updated 10 /4/07	Should have just returned it. Exchanged for a new one hoping that it would fix the problem. NOPE. Stupid thing keeps popping off every time we lift the seat	DON NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. You have been warned. Now Im outside return window. Company should do honorable thing and give me my money back		The quick release tabs keep popping off and as a result the seat falls off when you lift it up most of the time	It was installed correctly and is only happening on the left side. Just not snug enough. Otherwise would have been good for the money
1,Works good as a strainer but awful as a stopper.
1,Great in the beginning but started to corrode and would work inside. Believe it may have been a bad battery.
1,0 stars!  SHAME on this company for releasing this defective product!  Nothing but annoying false alarms, often in the middle of the night!  My special needs child is beyond frightened when this thing goes off without reason!  There should be a class action lawsuit against them!  The kicker is that it was recommended by 'Consumer Reports'! When I called their customer service number to lodge a complaint, I could only reach a robotic voice (no humans)! NEVER AGAIN will I buy 'Kidde' JUNK!
1,The diamond blade is extremely thin
1,Not impressed with it looking used. I looked to see where it would say that you're buying a used product and there wasn't any indication that I was buying something used.
1,First let me say this:  I'm not a fan of candelabra bulbs, but that's what I have to put in my ceiling fan light.  Great so far.  I was a little concerned with the somewhat-flimsy packaging, but they all work. The true test will be how LONG they work.  Ceiling fans are pretty rough on light bulbs.  Only time will tell.  I've been pricing these bulbs for a while.  I received these bulbs at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but even without the discount, these bulbs are a good value!		Update:  One of the four bulbs quit working at about the 6 month mark.  I thought they were going to last a long time, so I'm very disappointed!
1,bought this due to the "carabiner" on the end.  how ever it is not a carabiner, it is a metal spring clip to protect the blade when using the bottle opener.  it opens on the wrong side and very narrow opening to be used to clip onto even a belt loop.  the knife is overall to small to be used for much more then opening an envelope. very disappointed, i would return if i had the package it came in. i would not but again.  this item was purchased to be clipped onto a belt loop to use while at work to open boxes and such. so it is a poor choice for my need.  the one positive is it does seem to be constructed well.
1,I mainly bought this because I wanted something to keep my phone safe.  the phone pouch does not fit any modern phone only old small flip phones will fit.
1,Doesn't work. Tried removing several relatively small dings/ dents from my truck and it was impossible to use without leverage and even then it would pop	Off without removing dent. Don't waste your money
1,After using this knife for severals months my opinion of it has changed. This knife has only been used moderately. No heavy use or unreasonable cutting task at all, cardboard, zip ties, etc. The serrated portion of the blade keeps rolling over and constantly requires touching up. I contacted Kershaw and informed them of the problem. Much to my surprise, I was told that if I sent the knife in, (at my expense) that they would re-grind the blade for me to remove the serrations. REALLY? I said that would be like if your wife had her hair done at a salon and after they messed up her hair they offered to cut it off! I've been a fan of Kershaw for years, (I have 3 others) but now after this I'm kind of on the fence. The knife issue didn't bother me as much as the response that I got from customer service. Anyway, I think there are better choices than this particular knife. UPDATE! Kershaw is currently replacing the blade with a non serrated one. Hopefully this will take care of the problem since I never had any complaints with their plain edge blades before. UPDATE! Kershaw did end up resolving this matter to my satisfaction by replacing the blade with a non-serrated one.
1,I was able to reset the combination easily following the instructions, and so far the lock has opened each time I've tried it. However, several times the dial became harder to spin, and after reading other reviews I am leary. I don't think I would use this lock in circumstances that would be horribly inconvenient if it wasn't able to be opened reliably.
1,I got it programmed, but the alarm won't sound. Went back over the instructions numerous times and still couldn't get it working and all before I was leaving on a 2 week trip. I've been happy with other products of theirs, just not this one. Should have paid more heed to the reviews.
1,The design is great but the light is just too weak for all but the dimmest of applications
1,Not what I expected.
1,i'll return since it looks like a toy
1,Pros: solid heavy feel, nice looking, made in the USA.	Con: After 15 minutes of trying to get the blade installed, my thumb is sore from trying to push the itty bitty black button while trying to get the blade inserted. I've several different ways but for some reason I am unable to do so, on the unit I got, the itty bitty black button barely budges when it is pushed in. The package claimed easy on/off, unfortunately, this one just challenged me too much and had to be returned where I got it. Too bad, it felt good holding it in my hands.	---	Edit: I am raising my rating to two stars. I purchased another one from a different store and this time it works. The first one I purchased had a problem with the slider on top going all the way to the front. There appears to be either a manufacturing defect or something goes out of whack when the label used to hold the knife, which requires a bit of force to tear out, is pulled out to prepare the cutter for use. Either way, it's dewalt's fault.
1,will not work from the time i had a plumber install it,read reviews i wish i had! i did not know until the plumber left,hard to return. amazon should remove it.
1,B&D should be ashamed to put their name on this POS. I used it less than 10 times before the circuit board got so hot that it melted the case. This is also a replacement for the original that also fried. After reading the other reviews, I now know what happened. Unfortunately, B&D and DeWalt are the same company, so they're still going to get more of my $$. Hopefully they actually take a little pride in their workmanship in the DeWalt division.
1,Ordered two and neither worked at all!  I tried many different batteries (all new) and LEDs never even blinked to indicate working power.
1,So pretty but NOT really high quality stainless steel, this is a cheap thinner metal that rusts and stains within a month of owning, plus the door won't close properly right out of the box. I bought this garbage for $329, paid skilled plumber and needed plumbing parts, there is a reason this isn't sold at big box stores, they would be inundated with returns. Needed new door hardware. But looks good I suppose as long as you don't actually use sink for bleach etc.
1,These are for one time use only and cannot be reloaded. Due to this feature I do not recommend this at all. Too expensive for one time use.
1,Sticks out like a sore thumb.  Will catch you as you walk by.  Returned it.  Way too Big for hanging towels.
1,I purchased this to augment my other lights, but upon unpacking noted that the wire were separated and the plugs were priority so they would not light up when attached to another set.  Further more the actually came apart while handling.  I have never seen a product so badly made that it should never have been allowed in the marketplace.  LED wholesalers should pull the product immediately.
1,This is a piece of junk!  I wasn't expecting much for the price, but even with the cheap price I feel horribly ripped off.  The construction is flimsy.  The side caps feel like they are going to pop off whenever you use the tool.  The blade did not have an edge on it.  Even after 20 minutes with a diamond rod, carbide rod, and ceramic rod, the blade would not cut paper without tearing it.  Forget sharp enough to shave hair.  The saw blade is a joke.  There is no sharpness to the saw blade - the teeth are rounded!  It would not even begin to saw white pine.  The scissors are cheap and will not trim fingernails.  Also, once you open a blade or tool, the others shift inside the knife making it difficult to fold the blade/tool back into place.		Do not waste your money.  Several reviews spoke of giving this to your Scout.  Please do not purchase this for your Boy Scout or Cub Scout - as a Scoutmaster, I can assure you that this knife will not serve him!  I don't know what knife the other reviewers were using, but it clearly was not this knife.  This is the one and only Amazon purchase that I regret.
1,This is Not E14 to E12 socket adapter.	Stay away from this seller, very dumb misleading description. The one I received is E12-E14 adapter. FROM E12 to E14! This is fraudulent.
1,I bought this tool because it looked more week made than my old punch. Very disappointed after first use and its inability to punch a leather belt strap on one punch. Had to struggle to get it done. Pass on this tool.
1,I plugged this in last night then added a lamp plug & it sparked! I couldn't believe it. I had just opened it. I'm afraid to plug it back in the wall, I can't afford for it to cause a fire. I'm going to be asking for my money back.
1,These are a disappointing cheap knock-off of a similar looking and higher quality flashlight that you see sold in many places.  These are mostly plastic flashlights that are both cheap in feel and construction.  One of the flashlights I received would not even cut off and on- it just stays on and no matter how many times you push the red plastic button nothing happens  All you can do is remove the battery.  These flashlights are similar to what you would expect to find in a dollar store.
1,Measures not useful for use with the standards of most tools
1,Horrible product.  Unreliable. I purchased this back on May 9 to replace a previously failed device on the first floor.  I was awoken to the alarm giving off chirps early in the morning.  After I took the device down from the ceiling, and counted the chirps and looked at the back of the device. 3 chirps and it promptly died.
1,I so wished these were good.  But, they are not.		Please look at the photo I posted.  This is wear and tear from less than a 1 year!	I live near the ocean, so that has to be taken into account.		Each was placed on different side of my house.		- Note smoke like whiteness.	- The one that looks clean is actually pocked with little bubbles.		A sort of funny idea for these is to spray them with Scotch Guard and see how long that lasts.		I own hundreds of different LED lights.  All said, the one I by from Lowe's are really expensive, but they outlast everything.
1,They are really easy to install, but the lighting on these are horrible. I bought two of them and I thought they would be brighter. The only thing I accomplished is being able to tell where each side of my driveway gate is. If I still had the boxed I would return them!
1,Mixing valve failed after a year. Wand sprayer corroded/disintegrated within two.		Do not buy.
1,Grossly undersized.  I compared the 20 year old ,ragged & torn seal to this one.  Both could, with some imagination, be called nominally 1/4" wide across the "T".  The old one was a fat 1/4" and filled the channels under the door quite nicely.  The new one (this product) was an undersized, wimpy, worthless 1/4"  that's closer to 3/16" and is too soft to hold its shape.  It falls out almost as quickly as I can put it in.  The main part of the seal between the "T"s is about half the thickness of the old one.  Since I cut the 10' long piece to fit my 8' wide door, I can't return it.		Don't waste your time & money on this junk.
1,This does not fit the Simpson 260 as expected.
1,Bluetooth connectivity is spotty,tried 4 different phones. Cord sucks. Battery falls out when stood up like a boom box if moved at all. The reason I am writing this is the fact that it shuts off due to being over heated. The day I bought it I had it on my boat with an ambient temp of 85F and it was in the shade and kept shutting off due to heat. I work on 100F roofs so this will not work for me. Not what I expected from Dewalt. Sound is just OK. My JBL Charge has better sound,just not as loud. I am sending this back. I read the reviews and ignored the negatives because I love Dewalt products,don't make the same mistake.
1,The tool did not work well cutting through wood.  I know it says it can, but its not too good at it. Maybe if it was thinner; I tied 1.5 depth wood, and it didn't work well.  I'm sure this works great on drywall though!
1,this is not heavy duty, but makes a fine play tent for my daughter, but not what I wanted it for
1,Junk...lasted a month... now 2 of the extensions don't hold a bit... they don't lock in. Loved them at first now a waste of money!!!!
1,"Variable" means nothing up until about 90%, and after that erratic RPM's. Total waste.
1,I bought this to carry in my pocket for every day.  There are always a few times a day that I have need for a utility knife.  This knife is small and strong.  But the handle/frame is really disproportionately heavy and thick.  In the end it would be a much better tool if it were lighter.  I bought on a gamble and will make use of it.  I would not buy it again....for a utility tool this knife is just to clunky.
1,Surface not very clean and marred in places. Threw one of them away. Short one screw.
1,One didn't work, but the other nine did and I only needed eight.  Three more have burned out so I had to purchase more due to the color of light.  I would have preferred to purchase different bulbs but these are the only 6k I can find that will fit in my light and under the enclosure.  It isn't fully enclosed so it is not the heat that is causing the bulbs to fail, I just think they are very poorly made.  Save time and frustration, buy a little more expensive bulb so you don't have to deal with burned out bulbs.
1,CAN'T CUT IF YOU DON'T SEE THE BLADE. NO BEVEL CUT OPTION, CAN'T SEE THE LASER WHEN WORKING IN DAYLIGHT.	NOT A FAN
1,Total waste of moneywill not hold speed unless you open it up wide open.
1,I have a shower with  white-to very light gray slab granite, and a tub deck made of the same.  This granite absorbs moisture and darkens.  I used this sealer, and am not impressed.  Let me preface my comments by saying that I squeegee AND wipe down all the granite 100% of the time.  Right off the bat, the tub deck had a couple of places where the sealer didn't seem to do much of anything.  After 3 months, more spots are developing that show this moisture-induced darkening.  The sealer is clearly losing its effectiveness, after only 3 months.  Very disappointing, especially considering that the only time the stone gets wet is during actual shower use.  Fortunately, I know that if I don't use the shower for a month or two, the water "stains" will disappear.  So as soon as the remodel on the other bathroom is done, I'll use that shower and let this one "dry out".  But rest assured that after it's all back to the proper color, I will NOT be re-applying this worthless material again.  I am surprised to read the good reviews, but then again some granite is much less absorbent and so those folks might not have the same problem.		Here's a hint.... when shopping for your slab, bring a spray bottle full of water and wet the stone.  If it darkens after twenty minutes of being wet, keep shopping.  Darker granite is often much less absorbent than lighter colors, and fine grain is often better than wild swirled patterns.  Some granite even has resin infused under vacuum by the manufacturer (a great and effective way to go).  In any case.... try a different sealer than this stuff.
1,This does not fit every Kohler bowl except Kohler K 4404 tank as specified..  No Help was given when requested, I suggested that the description be changed since my fixture had a larger  outlet fitting hole in the china.  Description notes "For ALL OEMs except Kohler K 4404 tank" But Mine was a KOHLER 4413 2 piece and it did not fit DO NOT BUY THIS ONE IF YOUR CHINA OUTLET HOLE IS THE LARGER ONE..I suggest calling for support first!
1,Not as loud as my other whistle....I don't recommend these for emergency purpose.
1,Came in large packaging yet one glass pain broke and doesn't work consistently
1,A little to small
1,This is, outside of things that are DOA, the worst product I have ever purchased on amazon. I have experienced similar problems to other buyers mainly that what I received was not a "Helping Hands with Magnifying Glass" but a box of parts. I have no problem with a little bit of assembly, but there are absolutely no instructions, the image on the amazon page is only barely enough to decipher how this device is put together, and most people won't have enough fingers to reliably construct this. In fact, you're better off ordering another set of helping hands just so you can put this together!		Once it's finally assembled, it works fine but skip ordering this and save yourself 30 minutes of needless frustration. For this price, there are plenty of other good options. If you are enough of an idiot to order this despite negative reviews (like I was), attach the hands to the base in reverse to get a little more stability from it.		Unlike other sellers, I my magnifying glass did arrive with a cover so there were no scratches.		DO NOT ORDER! I have purchased hundreds of products of amazon and wrote about half that many reviews.
1,Latest firmware update locks out other bulbs even though Philips is in the Connected Lighting Alliance member they no longer follow the	 Zigbee Light Link products protocol So no more  interoperability with other brands
1,pros: only spout for under $20 that diverts 100%.	  different function, isn't your spout	  stylish, better looking than a spout in its price range.		cons: cheap; looks, feels and sounds like cheap plastic	  too high a price for plastic spout.	  you will probably need to replace spout pipe.
1,I've seen about 6 of these die in a matter of months now.  They aren't in closed fixtures.  They aren't on dimmers when they aren't supposed to.  They replaced regular old incandescent bulbs that actually lasted years in the fixtures.		These bulbs are apparently just junk.  Using the warranty involves mailing the bulb back to GE, so never mind, I'll just buy a different brand.  I know many name brands aren't worth what they used to be, and I guess I can add GE to that list.
1,Nice tools.  If anything goes wrong, its a paper weight.  NO INTERNAL PARTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THESE TOOLS.
1,Not at all the same color as an incandescent.  I miss the incandescent bulbs.
1,didn't work like I had hoped,  made a mess in basement and  won't drain well so I won't buy again
1,Died after 1 hour working, battery doesn't  charging, bought another battery but it's doesn't work too. I don't know what to do with this blouse I purchased this about a 35 days ago and return window is closed now. Very sad and disappointed with black & decker. Batter to pay anothe $100 and take a Makita or Dawalt and save your time
1,Item is described as a 16 Ultraviolet LED and while this flashlight has 16LED's only 5 are UV, one red in the center as a laser pointer, and the remainder clear LED's as in a flashlight.  I purchased this light over others for the fact it had 16 UV's and figured it would be brighter in that respect.  The UV 5 LED's are not that bright at all and one would have to be less than a foot away to achieve results.  The flashlight is shipped from China which I have no problem with but should be mentioned for a time factor consideration.  Red flag on this one !!!
1,I bought this gun hoping it would be better quality than HF. I was wrong the clamp thag holds the hopper to the gun stripped, the rubber gasket that seals the hopper to the spray gun is a little to big so its hard to slide the two together had to fight with it push it in with a screw driver. I was taking the air hose conection off so i can replace it with my ait fitting and it snapped in half with a little pressure. My HF gave me no problems I should of never loned it out. I will be buying another on from HF. Thats for sure.
1,Alarm keeps going off with no heat, fire or smoke around at all. Can't get it to stop.
