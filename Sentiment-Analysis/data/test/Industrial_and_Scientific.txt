0,Works Great for my remote actuated antenna disconnect drive system.
0,I the bench power supply I have only has a maximum of 500Ma out put.  I needed something with some more guts, This one works great.  At least it wasn't shipped my UPS so it wasn't damaged with got it.  I had a hard time decided between the digital readout verses the meters.
0,I like them!  Not planning on using them for the kitchen, they're in the darkroom to clean the sink and misc muck.	The scrubby part is aggressive and the sponge side is pretty absorbent.	I think theyll be great for what I need.
0,good stuff
0,I'm very pleased with these parts.  It is replacing a cheap brass coupler on my laser engraver.  I like the machined cuts between the two ends, it gives it a little flexibility and spring action if things are slightly misaligned.
0,Great product, never had any problem with any application I have used these screws on.

0,My TAZ 5 came with a .35 mm nozzle and it generally worked okay.  I have had a number of "clogs" with it and it takes about a day to clean with acetone.  So, I was anxious to try this larger nozzle.  It seems like the later TAZ's have been shipping with a .5 nozzle.  At the very least, I figured that this nozzle could be a spare to use if my .35 clogged.		But, once I installed this nozzle, I have left it in.  No clogs so far.  I haven't noticed any print degradation.
0,Going to save the wiring, very good.
0,This was my second purchase of the IC3D brand and I have found this product to be superior in quality and accuracy.  The black PLA prints are clean and less far less glossy than the standard PLA prints I have created in the past.  I highly recommend the IC3D high quality black PLA.  I printed a black motorcycle cup holder that has been my best PLA print to date with this filament.  Printing at medium settings (.2mm, 35 infill at a speed of 50) it produced a great looking product.  This is my second filament purchase from IC3D and I am really satisfied that this company produces quality filaments.
0,Works great.
0,Does what it says.
0,Fast and easy to use and calibrate. This comes with a calibration adjuster if you have a known temperature. it is fast, small, lightweight and has a pocket clip and nice case. We use this in our RV. It is not meant to be cooked with, just to quickly check inside temperature. I recommend, would buy again, and I hope this helps someone.
0,Bought 3M brand shrinking tubes set at Walmart which is much more expensive than this one. However the expensive shrinking tube does have higher shrinking ratio. As it is stated 2:1 ratio in this product, i guess it did 2:1 shrinking well. No more i had wished.

0,Title says it all, total improvement in freq response, sound characteristic, imaging and clarity. I won't have a device with a compatible output that one of these won't be hooked too. Even works great on my ps3...
0,Good tubing and cheap, so I keep a few feet on hand of each size, just in case I need it.
0,Good quality and they are easy to clean and reuse if needed.  I use them to mix leather dye to make custom colors for crafts.  No problems with them.
0,This meter works fine. I had previously posted a review here that said high resistance in the shunt caused skewed readings on the ammeter. I was using jumper cables that induced resistance into the test set up that led to my erroneous conclusion. Sorry.
0,So far so good.  Easy to install but watching the You tube videos on how and how to tell which lock to buy first sure helps.  Hopefully this will hold up.
0,ilove it

0,Great tape, very sticky, nice plastic storage container to keep it clean.  Yeah sure you can get 10 rolls at harborchinesecrap for a few bucks, but I've used that stuff too and it's worthless.  There is a lot of crap electrical tape on the market today, but this is quality stuff.  Spend extra for tape that sticks, but this.
0,Seems to be a decent product. The numbers are stamped in so they won't rub off or fade. Just what I needed. Good price too. Shipped quickly.
0,Nice fit and easy to install. Will plan to order again. Exactly what I need when I must replenish my supply.
0,Works pretty well! Havent had any issues with the material. Ive run about 3 ,20 hour prints consecutivly off the material and it hasn't clogged once.
0,After a few weeks of use with silicone thermal tape and glue stick on my 3D printer I can say that this product functions very well on any Prusa style printer that would need a glass build surface. Comes with ground edges and seemingly no warpage.
0,everything as always with amazon went perfect

0,it works but not well in heat
0,I had this unit for a couple weeks and got some great prints, especially for something around $200. I'd still recommend this printer to people, and I have friends who purchased one based on my suggestion and are happy with it.		However, I'm returning my unit because the rear fan started making some noise. It comes and goes, but I'd rather return to Amazon while I'm still within my allowed return window.		With that said, I'll be purchasing a CR-10 mini instead. For the beginner, this printer is great, but I found that I quickly became engulfed in the hobby. That's why I'm going to take what would be an otherwise frustrating situation of a noisy fan, and turn it into an opportunity to get something a little more intermediate.		This printer isn't perfectly, but here's my quick list of pros and cons:		Pros	 - Small form factor, requiires very little desk space	- Quality prints	- Pre-assembled, fast setup	- Fairly strong community for support		Cons	- USB connectivity is flaky (You have to disconnect/reconnect upon intial connection)	- SD card support is limited. SDXC SDHC etc do not work, in my experience. You need a <2GB standard SD card, I believe.	- Mods required to print flexible TPU (very easy to fix)	- Bed doesn't stay hot enough for large ABS prints
0,Good product, super price.
0,I love this tape.  If there's a problem, it's that it requires a bit of strength to pull out the amount needed and get it stuck in the right place.  Okay, so I'm a wussy old lady. This tape will fix just about anything, wouldn't be without it.
0,WORKS GREAT! What I NEEDED!
0,These work great, as expected.
0,This is the stickiest tape I've EVER used.		This is more sticky than the Duck HD and 3M top of line clear packing tapes, sticks to everything!		Best of all, it's only 13 bucks for 6 long rolls!
0,No problems with the Tiny AVR programmer. Works great!
0,This Rectorseal #5 is my favorite general purpose pipe thread compound that I reach for by default for most plumbing needs. I've been using it for years and it has always worked without issue for me. It seals pipe and fitting threads nicely and remains relatively soft after drying so parts can easily be disassembled years later if needed. Some thread compounds dry hard and often require heat to dissemble to take things apart. This #5 compound is sort of a dark mustard color and does have a fairly heavy odor initially, but it will dissipate over time. It is safe for PVC and other plastic pipes as well as traditional copper, brass, black iron and steel pipe. I use it on potable water and LP gas piping both alone or over Teflon thread tape. It's made here in the USA and I find it to be a very good product overall.
0,Brings out texture in wood. No stain needed. Nice finish and easy to spray on. I even had a run or three, just wiped it with my finger and blended right in, but that was my fault cause I got too close. I will never use a paint brush again.
0,The tester seems to be working fine. The readings are consistent. At least I was able to prove *someone* that the bottled water is just the same as our tap water - maybe only with more plastic taste.
0,It holds 2 large spools of filament (or wire if that is what you need it for), my only recommendation would be to make the spacer a bit larger (width and diameter) for the times you need to use spools that have larger hubs.
0,these are very good quality. will buy again
0,Good value, long lasting
0,no complaints. in the past the sweeper brooms i have had came with all or some parts being constructed from wood. good at first but after a few year not so much. with this aluminum model due to materials i fully expect to last a good long time.
0,...it cooks pretty well. All-in-all it is an excellent value in budget cookware.		Almost all my non-stick saut&eacute; pans, fry pans and skillets have been T-Fal for many years and I like them a lot. On the basis of that, I bought this less expensive 8" fry pan for our travel trailer where it would see much less use. Meanwhile, I have been using it in the kitchen alongside my other more expensive T-Fal cookware. In comparison, it seems to have excellent resistant to warping as does my other T-Fal, and the exterior finish is actually harder and more scratch-resistant. It's also easier to clean up (by hand; I never run non-stick through the dishwasher). The Thermo-Spot indicator seems to be comparably accurate in indicating a suitable oil temperature for frying or saut&eacute;ing. The aluminum is not as thick as the Professional series and it doesn't cook quite as evenly (omelettes often have a few brown spots). To T-Fal's credit they did not try to disguise the metal's thinness by rolling or flaring the top edge as a lot of cheap cookware manufacturers do.
0,This was a purchase for school..  Good quality and nice packaging. Fits nicely into my "go bag" for school. Would recommend.

0,WD-40 Lubricant Aerosol Can with Smart Straw, I am Glad I got this Aerosol Can, for some reason  I can't find it where I Live and Shop. I specially like the Smart Straw it's a lot easier to do things with it and mine works Great! Now I can get it inside (almost) into the brackets and hinges of my Entrance Door to get rid of all the Squeaking noises and other doors as well, and without the mess, you aim and spray, is that simple, Now people don't know if I'm coming or going because I don't make a sound. I keep finding more and more things to use and spray with WD-40. I tried it on Silver WD-40 supposed to protect the metal from tarnishing, and it seems to be working! D.D. Thank You
0,Gorgeously made. Picture perfect.
0,Great filament, good price.  I have used about half of the spool and had no major issues to make note of.		The filament seems slightly more brittle then other stuff I have used, I have had it break off when starting to feed it into my extruder a few times, but once its in there, it seems fine.
0,I drilled a 1/2" dia hole near one end.  It works great as a shallow water anchor for about half the price of the ones in the spotting good and boating stores!  Kind of funny that the 1 1/16"  72" was less expensive than the 1"x72".
0,A great starter assortment for pegboards.

0,I'm a soap maker and a potter. My pottery studio is in my basement. In the winter, fall, and spring it can get pretty cold there. The basement does receive some heating with the rest of the house so it is never close to freezing. It is never warm though (well, only when running my kilns). My buckets of water are usually pretty cold. Putting my hands into those buckets countless times a day makes my hands chapped, cold, and achy. My main source of water is the hose outside. I was really excited about this product with fall coming on strong here right now.	The thought of dipping my hands and sponges into warm water is delightful!		When I received the pail heating blanket, I immediately filled a new 5 gallon bucket with water. The water was an even 70*. An hour later it was 79*. An hour later it was 84* with an hour after that it was 89*. Now we're up to 4 hours after filling the bucket and it was at 90*. At five hours it was 92*. At that point I had to leave my studio and when I returned it was 100* at a total of 10 hours from filling. Then it sat overnight and 12+ hours after the last reading it was still at 100*. I would expect that it would have heated faster and held more heat if the lid had been on my bucket - I'm sure I'm losing a lot of heat from the surface. As it is though, I'm doing a happy dance! I'm so EXCITED to use this during this winter and 100* is perfect for me.		I love-	the concept	that it is easily removable		I dislike-	the length of the cord, it's too short		As a soap maker, I can easily see using this to measure my oils the night before and leave them heating so they are ready when I am. That will be a larger batch than I'm currently making though.		We currently use heated dog water dishes, heated buckets for the goats water, submersible heaters for the water trough and aquaponics in the winter during the worst weather - I'm sure we'll find other uses for this pail heating blanket.
0,We just got these and I am so excited to use them!!!		These are quality screws that can be used for more than just drywall. We are slowly updating the house and use this style often. They work for door hinges, hanging stuff on walls. They have an inset screw head that won't stick out; they lay flush with the surface.		They are quality. They don't bend. I've had some that bend quite easily with only slight pressure.
0,Great filament for a great price.  Best filament out there right now.  I only buy Hatchbox now.

0,So far it's prints pretty well. Just keep in mind it seems a bit more on the "Pink" side of the color scale. Haven't had any bubbles, clogs, or any other common issues. I'll keep this review updated if I come across any issues.		But for now, I'd definitely recommend this filament.
0,Work well and as advertised. Good price.
0,Used it at a state park for one of our events. worked fine for us (had it up over a weekend) so I don't know how it holds up for weeks or months.
0,very nice small lift. I use it to raise my riding mower to work on it!
0,I like mine I have had it for 3 years. For the price you cant beat it
0,Am overseas and yet to examine product.  Like more technical documentation
0,A good hook-up wire for track and lighting.
0,Bought this forever ago when it was super cheap, before I even had a printer. It has lasted me forever and is by far the easiest material to print with.(That I have.) I love this stuff, though the color is more pink than purple.
0,This is a sanity-saver! With a big, hairy newfoundland, there is lots and lots of dog fur daily. Being able to program this unit is great. We get through two, sometimes three, empties per run. The only down-side is that fur wraps around the wheels and gets very hot, so we only run it when home in case it gets so hot it catches on fire.
0,This really works well.  However, it does have a powerful odor.
0,Great tool. Very sturdy and strong! Would buy again.
0,Love this super performance duct tape! I used this to tape my parts of my old and falling apart air-conditioner filter. This tape while strong is also fairly easy to pull off without damaging the taped portion.		In addition, I use this tape to tape wires running around my house. I am fully confident that the tape is strong enough to tape down the wires and at the same time gentle enough not to damage my flooring when I pull them off the ground.		Recommended for taping almost anything!
0,Had an opportunity to use this. Helpful if you make a mark at the fluid level on the glass tube. very necessary item
0,For what these are, they're great, and they work well.
0,Exact replacement. Fixed my patio door!
0,nice size for my aquariums (20L are my smallest tanks)
0,Our test tubes arrived just fine and were not scratched fortunately. We rolled up the invitation to my daughter's science- themed birthday party and delivered them in the test tube. Worked out great. Since they are plastic we did not have to worry about either my daughter or her friends breaking them and getting hurt. Perfect for our needs.
0,Was as said
0,These are the best for the smaller dispensers, although others are also compatible and somewhat cheaper. I opt for the better quality that these offer for my customers. Kind of like the difference between toilet paper with splinters and soft, plush Charmin!

0,The IC3D motto, "For 3D Printers, By 3D Printers" is right on.  The focus on getting desktop 3D printers that work for the masses is a plus too. We are a satisfied customer and love the "Made in the USA" (and Made in Ohio) part especially.
0,Not much to say about the brads... They fit my Dewalt and Senco gun well.

0,This Anderson stuff is well made
0,Incredible magnet but like the instructions say, you have to be careful with this.  If you have anything magnetic within about a foot (other magnets) or six inches (scissors, knives or costume jewelry) of this magnet, the items might interact suddenly.  This is NOT A TOY and you must KEEP IT OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN, who might get injured when two items collide or killed should they decide it would be a good idea to put it in their mouth and swallow it.		We are using this magnet as a permanent installation in the kitchen as part of a custom made knife rack. (I've actually come online to order additional pieces, we've gone hog-wild and want a longer rack).  And since all rare earth/neodymium magnets are brittle, we take extra care not to let them strike anything so they don't get chipped or broken.
0,This glue is getting VERY hard to find in stores. It works great and I use it for a equipment repairs which specifically call for this product so it is good to still be able to get it at a very competitive price. Great product at a good price - what more can I say?
0,Just got these.  They came with warnings about the strength.  I said "Sure, real killers".  Well, it took a lot to remove one from the stack and there is a nylon or plastic spacer holding them apart.  Pretty cool I thought.  When I started to put the (now) single one down about 6" from the stack it flew out of my hand to the stack and broke about 1/4 of itself.  I have to figure out how to remove it now.  These guys are absolutely correct with the warnings so please read and heed.  I love these but maybe they are too strong for my uses but with a non magnetic hunk of something I can tailor their pull to meet my needs.  I usually blow off warnings but not so with these.  If you need killer magnets these are the way to go.
0,These have been fantastic to use! They have worked out well and arrived fast. I've used them in many experiments requiring heat with no problems!
0,This is a very nice switch......wish it had more of a tactile feel when depressed.......click-clack.  Looks nice and well made.  Makes one wonder why we put up with that same-ol, same-ol stuff from a certain soon -to- go- under electronics supply chain.  Would recommend.
0,I do like this filament, but so far I haven't gotten the wood look that some others are getting.  I made a bunch of stuff for people for Christmas with this thinking I could sand and stain, and make it look like wood.  Nothing really worked.  My guess is that your best experience is with fairly flat pieces. The stuff I printed was too brittle to sand and didn't accept the stain very well.  If you're printing something with some dimension, it's probably going to look at act just like PLA.  It does smell like wood, but it doesn't feel like wood.  I still like it.  It's a nice color and it doesn't feel as dense as PLA.  Plus, it floats, at least the capybaras did. I'll probably try another wood filament next time, but this isn't a total fail.
0,4 stars and not 5 because despite working well, after a year of on and off water exposure it is majorly rusted and does not function smoothly, but other brass parts I'm using work just fine without rust... to be expected for a cheap quick connect. Go ahead and get this if you're using air in your lines, not a problem at all
0,I bought these to use as a slot bit in my drill/drill press. For this purpose they work great!

0,It's not a Dyson. It's not priced like a Dyson. So I won't compare the two.		The last vacuum I bought was over 15 years ago. It's still working today (after replacing the belt myself once) but this one improved on it in a few ways :		1. Bagless. I really dislike changing the dust bag. First, I can't tell if it's full. Next, there's the inevitable puff of dust when I open it up. I like a see-through canister that holds the dust MUCH better.		2. Retractable cord system. Pull to extend the cord. Press a small lever (with your foot) and it retracts out of the way. Sure beats winding it up when I'm done.		3. Brush motor can be turned off.		4. Power button on grip - easy to reach when holding vacuum.		5. Almost all controls can be reached without bending down. The only thing I need to bend down for is to adjust the height of the intake (when going from hardwood floor to carpet, for example).		It's still a vacuum cleaner. Takes a little effort to push around, but no worse (and perhaps a little bit better) than other vacuums I've used before. The hose is rather heavy and somewhat stiff, but works OK. A little assembly required, have a screwdriver handy.

0,Feels well built.  What I received was better quality than that of Lowes or Homedepot.
0,I bought a Flashforge Creator Pro last week that came with one spool of black ABS and one of White. I started printing with that, trying various models from thingiverse.com with varying success. I also bought this BAMtack! white PLA at the same time, but didn't start using it until yesterday. I can't compare it to any other PLA (yet) since this is all I've used so far, but after printing the Celtic Skull in White ABS and then using this PLA, I can say the differences are pretty amazing.		It isn't an exactly fair test, since the ABS was printed at .3 mm layer height, which likely caused the layer splitting as the part cooled and the PLA was printed at .1 mm layer height, allowing more detail, but the important thing is the color difference. The one on the left was made with the BAMtack! White, and to paraphrase Spinal Tap, "How much whiter could it be? The answer is none... None more white." I thought the ABS was white before I printed with this PLA, now I can see it is really more of a greyish off-white.		The print quality and detail is really good, and it stuck to the build plate perfectly using mostly default Simplify3D settings. I bought this because it was among the cheapest PLA I could find on Amazon (I just wanted something to test PLA printing at the time) and I'd happily buy it again, the quality for this spool has been perfect so far.

0,I use these to meter out ~2ml of Star-San no-rinse sanitizer into a 32 fl. oz bottle in order to sanitize my homebrew equipment.  Much easier to do than trying to measure out 1/3 of a teaspon!  Since I'm metering sanitizer, I can also re-use them :).

0,I had been using sandpaper on my grips but got tired of them rubbing on me and everything else. These are just as grippy without the annoying side effects. Excellent purchase for anyone looking to add a little more grip to their pistol, knife or anything else for that matter.
0,Quick shipment. Outside is exactly 3" x 5". One 3 x 5 index card will fit in, but as it's exactly 3" x 5" a small stack of cards will not fit. They are definitely see-through but not quite clear.
0,Worth every penny.  This is a real good filament and I really am glad I spent the extra money to buy it.  ABS is hard enough to print but this manufacturer did an excellent job with this product.  My prints look real good and I have regained my faith in ABS prints.  IC3D is worth buying.
0,I have been using this all week with a sanding project I am doing with garden furniture... they work great... stick amazing.. and last a long time... Great product	I have been using this with Trade Associates AF44L 7 Piece Dura Block...they work great together
0,Strong enough that two magnets are holding a paper towel holder reliably on a metal cabinet door.
0,These are the industry standard to clean professional cinema lenses. Combine this with Panchro lens cleaning solution and you are the best Camea Assistant!
0,Heavy and as described. Unlike some others it doesn't seem like this will break if I look at it wrong. A good size for what I needed
0,This tool facilitates the identification of cables in electrical boards. very useful and safe. I recommend it to carry in briefcase tools ...

0,I'd been having issues with jams and I'd noticed that the print quality had gotten a little sloppy. After running a foot of this through my printer I've noticed an immediate improvement.

0,They seriously managed to wrap this stuff in such a way that it forms a long clear tube... Quite amazing really.. I think this is hand made!
0,Great quality!
0,this hook and loop velcro is so useful for so many different paths. You can use it to Mount your remote control on the wall. We used the hook part to put things on to felt.
0,Rechargable on its base.  It also comes with a travel case.	My old electric toothbrush, by the same manufacturer gave up the ghost after 10-12 years.	This one comes with a nifty (but somewhat large) travel case, which holds the handle and a couple of brush heads.  Great idea.	For travel, I had been using a smaller-handled unit, run by 2 AA cells.  You could get at least 60 brushes (i.e., 30 days if you brush morning & night) on the 2 disposable batteries.  Surprisingly, the portable one did not come with a travel case!	Annoyingly, the brush pauses for a half-second every 30 seconds or so, just in case you don't know if you've brushed long enough (really dumb feature, for which I dropped the unit one star).

0,These are good quality copper terminals, and if memory serves, were properly sized for the cable advertised.. How you make your connection is also important, as has been mentioned long before my review. But, I started out as a heavy equipment field mechanic, so you have to make do with what is available on your truck. I used a crimp tool that looks like a baby cable cutter. You put the new cable into your new terminal and then put it into your wee crimper. Lay it on a cat track (or any fairly heavy piece of metal) and smack it a time or two with your ball peen. I would then finish the job by heating with the torch and soldering it up with some 50/50 rosin core. Seemed to work pretty good.	Of course, if you happen to have a twenty ton hydraulic press knocking around in your service truck, well I suspect you might turn out a prettier solder-less joint......
0,There are a lot of gloves out there, and these are among the best. I wanted something a little thicker than the cheapies, but not so much as to lose the "feel" when picking up small things etc. I gave them a workout, though, when cleaning a BBQ grille with a drill and abrasive wheel. They worked great - no tears! So these gloves work perfect for most jobs!
0,These are awesome. Installed in about 5 minutes per set. I ordered two sets when the price was $35 each, wish I ordered a few more. $48 is too steep for some wheels. 1/4" bolts that come with are perfect size. When installing, it is important to remember the "B" engraving on the wheel goes to the inside. Otherwise bolt holes will not align properly. Great Product
0,Works well as most Fluke products do.  No need to touch wires-just getting close is enough to trigger the light in the unit.
0,Not much to say here. This tape does it's job. Nice size roll, not super small like some electrical tapes.		Has worked well and stayed on where I used it so far. I would purchase again.		Quack quack for duck brands!

0,Good value and sized to easily fit into my bag!
0,Truly amazing lubricant product.  I used it on an old vise, some tools and other metal parts.  Seems to really work so far.  The "wet" evaporates quickly.  After reading some comments, I was dreading removal of spill or mis-application.  However, cleanup  is not too bad (use washes of first acetone / then 90% alcohol /acetone /alcohol).
0,Big fan of these to add to a toolbox, multiple uses and price is right.  have not had any issues with quality of the screws.
0,These are so handy for many uses, hamburger patties of course, but also for individual homemade garlic bread to freeze for later!
0,have issues with my legs which need some compression but using compression socks aren't long enough and hard to use.  I can cut the lengths I need as I need them using this.
0,was exactly what i ordered and needed  very satisfied
0,Easy soldering.
0,Great kit, very easy to assemble, works just as advertized.
0,It is wire. It works for the projects I need.	Don't know what else to say?
0,if you are needing something like this that is not super heavy then here you go.  They won't corrode but they can be easily stripped or broken.  Don't over tighten them or use these where nothing will hit them and they should be just fine.
0,Well made. Good price.
0,I paid 4.99 for this and I am a happy customer. I use it primarily to measure media for making slants for my brewing yeast. However, deep down inside I still do kinda wish I had a nice electric vacuum pipettor.
0,Good electrical terminals.
0,Strong. Keep in a plastic bottle to protect from cracks and pinching.
0,Can't beat this for the price. I added the set to my larger first aid kits in my GO BAGS.	Hopefully they'll never be used.
0,Hathbox is the best PLA on the market!
0,Love the stuff
0,Good, works, no leaks. But the release valve has problems staying screwed in unless you take a wrench to it. And the valve screw is not a nut, so it's more difficult to turn.	Small - good to keep as a 2nd jack in the car.
0,great buy
0,Works perfectly on my 10ml pipette!  Way better than a squeeze ball.
0,Hatchbox makes great filament at a fair price.  Have used almost 3/4 of this spool so far and have not had issue one with the filament (only issues were user issues).  It lays down nicely with almost zero skips (porosity's)..in fact I have only heard one.  After trying some of the other products out there I am sticking with Hatchbox products due to there quality and price.
0,Great Product!!
0,Does the job and look great.
0,Great for 1 by and 3/4 ply. great looking accent for "industrial" type pieces. the kreg system is awesome. And i still need tewnty words to post this.
0,this is a great filament just like most of inlands filaments it prints well, i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it looks more orange than red Inland please adjust the color tint.
0,arrived on time and was as described
0,small, stainless steel and very easy to clean. flawless temp accuracy. I have dropped this several times and even stepped on it once. still in one piece.
0,These are great and you get a lot. I use these for essential oils and never experienced a problems with them. This is my second purchase of these because I give so many away. I will definitely order them again.
0,Beautiful vibrant color. Works great
0,this velcro is good made stuff i use it for a lot of thing a round the house buy it worth the money
0,They were as advertised.
0,Great tool and well made.  I use it on our garden fountain which has finally lost its protective surface veneer and requires cleaning now almost daily.
0,Excellent product and service!!  Thank you!!
0,Can't make 3/4" wood projects without em. They work really well high end screws, Will with out a doubt  be buying more in the near future... Thanks  Pitbullman
0,you can never have enough bins and these work well for light items
0,Easy to use. Work great for my soaping needs.

0,Worked as advertised.
0,Really helps drilling and tapping
0,Great storage for my slides
0,Got this to use in the lab and it's really convenient. It's acuracy is maybe off by 1 degree C, but good enough to make sure the water bath is warm enough or the incubator is holding proper temperature. Really hard to beat for the price, especially since the scientific catalogs charge 3X as much.
0,This tape is great.  It sticks to itself but nothing else.  I bought it for assembling small wooden boxes I make in my woodshop.  One night several members of my family started to list the useful applications for this tape....and the list just went on and on.  We actually had a great time with our creative thinking.  Highly recommended.
0,When I ordered these I didn't realize I ordered the 100 pack.	They are exactly as described and do their job.
0,works good
0,This is great tape for a wide variety of crafting and art projects. Whether I'm scrapbooking, visual journaling, or creating a piece of wall art with a little bit of 3D pop this is the perfect tape for my creation! It also works well for hanging small, light weight artsy creations or decor here and there to give your home or office a unique, individual look.		To store it, I just hung it on one of the large hooks, the kind you'd use to hang a bike on, that I have screwed into the sides of shelves in my art studio.
0,Works good
0,Worked great. Lines seams to be very good quality.
0,Worked great on garage door, no more air leaks around door.
0,This is a real, honest review of a product I actually paid for and have used professionally.  I was NOT given the product to review and I have received nothing for this review.  Oh, and by the way, I have been using these probes professionally for years.  I just recently ordered a new set for a new meter I got.  Every good multimeter I have has a set of these probes to go with it.		These probes are an absolute MUST HAVE when working with modern SMT electronics.		Be aware that these precision probes are a bit delicate, so don't throw your standard multimeter probes away as you will still want those for some applications.  Youll also want those old clunky probes for when you loan your meter out.		The good news is that the tips for these probes are replaceable.  The tips are standard pogo pins used in bed-of-nails test fixtures, so there is a wide world of specialized pins that will work in these genius probes.  Pomona also sells a nice kit of replacement tips.  If you're careful with them, the tips will last forever, but its good that they are replaceable if necessary.		Some of the pins available for these probes are needle-sharp, so be careful.		In honestly advise buying two or three sets.  Once you have a set on one meter, youll want them on all of your meters.  And, once anyone else sees these probes, theyll want a set too.		Because these probes are a bit delicate and also sharp, I highly recommend also getting a POMONA 5955 CARRYING POUCH to keep them in; its a very nice pouch and perfect for keeping these probes in.		Because these probes are for use with microelectronics, they are expected to be used in tight places.  So, they lack the large finger guards found just above the tip on most millimeter probes.  While these probes have a nice gripping rubber surface, your fingers might slip down the probe and, without that guard, slide onto energized circuitry.  As a result, these probes are suitable only for testing safe, extra-low-voltage circuitry.		Just two more little notes:  first, these probes are color-coded red and black on the ends, but the rest of the probes and cables are gray; this could be an issue in some situations where rules and regulations require that probes be fully-color-coded.  And, second, these probes do have right-angle, safety-sheathed plugs. The safety-sheath can be cut off if your instrument doesnt accommodate it, but the right angle might be a problem for connecting to some instruments requiring complete replacement of the plug.		Otherwise, these probes are everything you expect from Pomona, high quality and great design.  I highly recommend them.

0,A reliable name in electronic testing equipment and a good product from them.
0,This is an easy-to-use hand-held radiation detector, simple for a non-professional like myself. I have also reviewed an earlier version of RADEX RD 1503+&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/RADEX-RD1503-w-o-dosimeter-High-accuracy-Geiger-counter-radiation-detector/dp/B005ZQ47AS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">RADEX RD1503+ w/o dosimeter: High accuracy Geiger counter, radiation detector</a>&nbsp;as a comparison. Both measure Beta, Gamma, and X-Ray radiation, and, as advertised, this RD1212 is faster! The RD1212 gives an initial reading in approx. 10 seconds, while the RD1503+ gives an initial reading in about 14 seconds. The full readings, which appear to be within approx. .05 microSv (if that) of the initial readings in difference (just my non-scientific observation), are a more significant amount of time- about one minute apart, with the RD1212 finishing first. Both are ridiculously easy to use, in that you basically add the included batteries (2-AAAs) and press the ON (largest) button on the lower right hand side. That's it. Both have audio and/or vibration alarms pre-set to a threshold of .3 microSv, but are adjustable, and both have back-lighting options to see the screens in lower light settings.		The RD1212, unlike the RD1503+, has the ability to record and store your data points onto a PC (comes with a Mini-USB-B plug- not Micro) using downloadable software from QuartaRad's website, and you can interactively plot and share your readings on a map with other individuals using the same software/ devices worldwide. The RD1212 also shows the threshold alarm level on the main screen itself (vs. inside the menu for the RD1503+), and has several language options (Russian, English, French, German, Japanese). The RD1503+ appears to be sold (in the US at least) with English only, but does give the option to use older micro Roetgens per hour as the unit of measure. I looked on the specs for both the RD1212 and the RD1503+on the QuartaRad site and there are minor discrepancies between the included paper technical specs that come with the devices and the specs listed on the website, such as some commas instead of periods for decimals, or minor discrepancies in energy ranges registered ("0,4 to 3,5" MeV for beta radiation on RD1212's paper specs vs. "0.25- 3.5" on the website), but i'm not sure how much that would matter to the causal user anyways. Perhaps the biggest differences I noticed in the specs between the two devices is that the RD1212 has a "Range of Indications" of 0.05-999.00 microSv/h (per website), whereas RD1503+ shows 0.05- 9.99 (also website). The uninterrupted operation time is no less than 300 hours for the RD1212, and 550 hours for the RD1503+. This RD1212 costs about $50 more than the RD1503+, but depending on your needs, either device is suitable.		Another curiosity/ feature is that you can also use this RD1212 precision machine as a... flashlight....heh, maybe the engineers have an answer for this, but it seemed to me to be as random a feature as if this also doubled as an oven-timer or something like that. For fun, I looked up in Wikipedia, the "Banana Equivalent Dose (BED), [which] is an informal expression of ionizing radiation exposure, intended as a general educational example to indicate the potential dose due to naturally occurring radioactive isotopes by eating one average-sized banana. One BED is often taken as 0.1 Sv" To check this, i took a measurement using both the RD1212 and the RD1503+- as you can see from my pic, yep, the devices next to my bananas registered very much in that range- about 0.08-.11 microSv in my four trials.		I mentioned this in my RD1503+ review, but check your old watches. I wrote that there are watches from the mid-20th century (pre-1960s) that were made with radium dials- my husband collects many antique watches, and measured one watch with a reading of .84 - in the "Alert" zone, which the RD1503+ manual says should be avoided. There is also an incredible story on the quartarad website where a traveler measured upper 90s-100s microSvs in his hotel hallway, to find that the guy in the room next door had just had returned from the hospital after a radioactive therapy treatment for thyroid cancer. Apparently, the ionized radiation levels emanating from such patients can last weeks, even after the end of treatment! The traveler asked for a different room.		These are great devices, and they bring some peace of mind.
0,I'm using this guy to monitor temperatures in my SCTO coffee roaster.  It's worked just fine for that purpose, no complaints.  I appreciate that it came with two probes in case I manage to wreck one.
0,I used these to store some Brusho Crystal Colors (they are powdered watercolor paints) and while they aren't *perfect* for that particular use, they are great little jars. They are super thick and durable- you don't need to worry about banging them into each other or dropping them on a soft floor- but are crystal clear and it's easy to identify the contents. The droppers work well and fill easily.		Because they have a relatively narrow mouth, filling them was *not* easy, so I suggest purchasing a tiny funnel to use with these.		I like them so much, I'm considering using these to store some fluid watercolors and inks I have in plastic dropper bottles and jars- I like the way they look, how durable they feel, and the control that the vial dropper allows for (you can use it as either a dropper or sort of a "stir stick").		Totally recommended. Packed well and arrived perfectly.
0,still holding together, and i am a bit surprised by that.
0,Does the job
0,Keeps my gas piston air rifles in proper working order.
0,nice item
0,I ordered this vacuum for my hubby to use in his garage. I read many reviews before deciding on this one. My hubby is very happy with this and is amazed at how much suction it has.
0,This glue is getting VERY hard to find in stores. It works great and I use it for a equipment repairs which specifically call for this product so it is good to still be able to get it at a very competitive price. Great product at a good price - what more can I say?
0,Its so much easier to put a few drops of must, wort, wine, juice or whatever onto this thing than to take a large sample to use a hydrometer.
0,Satisfactory performance at a very good price  Less than 1/2 price compared top the big boxes
0,A  OK
0,as advertised
0,great little shop vac. Plenty of power. only a couple of gripes, and the first is not really a gripe - I wish it had more space for collection. I know it's a mini version, but the blower assembly takes up more than half of the bucket space. The second is that the filter attachment method promotes the trapping of debris. The tapered ring that slides over the paper filter, which is just behind the inlet, traps material. This makes clean ups messy, because you need to remove the ring to shake everything out.
0,Really good small spray bottles. Atomizes very well.
0,Very good size for small projects!
0,Easy interface to read, useful feature where you can turn off the back lighting or the laser pointer.
0,Easy to use and covers well.  As for now, it seems to be protecting our furniture ok, though ours sits partially shaded, so it may take years to know whether this is really effective. We've had plastic wicker furniture in the past and it does indeed eventually crack and start to come undone.  We're hoping this will prolong the life of our new set.  We noticed no discoloration, smell or change in the sheen or texture of our furniture after using this.
0,They work as well as the Open Builds version.
0,holds up well
0,Can't say much about this one, it just a plastic hose. Product was as described.
0,As advertised ... Good deal.
0,GREAT STUFF!
0,Too bad that sebo has to use plastic in their bags, but the design certainly does ensure ease of use and no dirt gets out.		I love my Sebo - couldn't more highly recommend a vac.
0,I work in a neuroscience lab where we perform brain surgeries on rodents. We use Vetbond to reattach the scalp after surgeries. It glues up the scalp quickly (within a few seconds) and dries fast as well. It leaves the skin pliable. This is great stuff and better than having to use staples, etc.
0,Tens electrodes are supposed to be able to be removed and then stick again several times.  I've had problems being able to keep the electrodes on let alone using them several times.  This gel helps keep them on but actually be able to use the electrodes several times.  This is a complaint of many people using electrodes but this product does a lot to keeping them stuck and getting several uses from them.

0,A very well made product and works perfectly. I would choose again for future needs.	A great price bargain  indeed. They take the frustration out of wiring multiple 12V devices.
0,Made of pretty thick glass and scale is easy to read.
0,Shipped on time and arrived in good condition.  Was easy to use and when used the engine with 190000 miles on it checked out great.  In my opinion well worth the price.
0,Good quality at a good price, as described.
0,These worked out well in my workshop.
0,Bought as a gift I already own one and love it for setting up my table saw.
0,Ok
0,So this was my first go at 3d printing, and I knew, getting this printer, what to expect.		 Quick note: My review is not labeled as a review by a confirmed purchaser. This is because I actually received the machine as a gift, so yeah. That's that.		Quick note 2: Be advised, this printer can be a bit frustrating at first, and 3d printing is half art, and half science. Once you are familiar with this machine, you'll remember why you bought it.		General Impressions:	So the Creator Pro is an amazing machine. Seriously, I've had mine for a few months now, and it's probably the best use of 1000$ I've made in one go. It is a very well built machine, and it is very clear that it was designed with ease of part replacement in mind. Seriously, a monkey with a spanner could probably replace every component in this machine, basically all of which are sold directly from FlashForge, so if a part breaks, fear not, FlashForge has you covered. In more ways than one in fact. It's also precise, simple, and relatively easy to operate.		In the last 2 months I have had this printer, I have had problems, but at the end of the day, they tended to simply be down to user inexperience. I have had one part issue, however this was due to careless handling by the delivery company (UPS I think) which resulted in the threaded z-axis height control rod being misaligned. While this only took me a few seconds to correct, I do have keep a 3mm plastic plate attached to the back of the build plate assembly to ensure it's proper height likely due to this mishap. The only other issues I've had have been extremely minor, and the support department, headed by Mr. Tang was extremely helpful in correcting them, not only responding in a courteous and professional manner, but with clear and concise directions on how to correct issues, as well as labeled pictures. What's more is that FlashForge support responded within hours, sometimes within minutes, and never more than a day. If not for them, this review would have been a star or two lower.		 Performance:	Once it's properly calibrated, this machine runs like a dream. I've tested the layer height from 0.2 down to 0.1mm, and I have no doubts that it could get even more precise. The print head assembly is very well constructed, and the sturdy, metal guide rods and factory installed belt tensioner springs ensure that every movement this printer makes is precise and accurate. The entire print bed assembly is supported by metal framework and is not susceptible to the plate support warping issues experienced by some printers. Temperature control of the print heads and build platform is exceptional, and I have never seen it fluctuate by more than a degree while the printer was in operation. One of the things about this machine that enables it to run so well is that it is a simple machine inside of a sturdy casing and frame, constructed entirely of metal framework and strong plastic side panels. It's simplicity reduces the chance for something to fail, and makes replacement of parts a breeze. The sturdy vibrates only extremely minorly when the print head is moving rapidly, despite the abnormally heavy dual extruder assembly moving so quickly.		 A word of warning:	This is a precision machine, and to maintain precision and working order, it is up to you to keep the printer well calibrated and in good repair. If you are inexperienced, or if you are concerned about your abilities to perform maintenance on such a machine, you may want to buy a more entry level printer first, and then work your way up to more serious machines like the Creator Pro. It is very much a serious machine, that produces serious results when operated by serious people.		 Pros:	- Dual extruders! Got an extruder down for repair? That's fine, because you have two of them. You can load a different type or color of filament in either one, and eliminate the irritation of constantly changing filament, which, by the way, is a trivial task on this printer.	- Price: it's basically a Makerbot Replicator with more features and a sturdier structure. Not to mention the exceptional support team. My point is, you're paying 1000$ for a superior version of a 2000$ machine. Do it.	- Precision: Once you have all of the kinks worked out of this machine, it produces some of the finest prints you will ever see.	- Construction: It's simple, yet sturdy. It doesn't take a degree in mechanical or electrical engineering to replace a part.	- Easy to use: The actual operation of this machine is simple and straightforward. So long as you have it calibrated and well cared for, this machine will be the best 1000$ purchase you ever make.	- Support: You're not just paying for the printer. You're paying for a printer that is covered by amazing support from Tang's team.	- LED Strips: Ok, this isn't really a performance thing, but this thing looks awesome when you set up the LED strips to the right color. This can be done from the control panel in Replicator G while connected to the printer via USB.	- Heated build plate: If you have owned a non-HBP printer, you will learn to love this machine very very quickly.	- Material variety: This printer runs fine with ABS or PLA, and can run plenty of other filaments.		Cons:	- Noise: Ok, it's actually not that bad, and there are worse printers out there about this. The default operation speed on ReplicatorG for Sailfish is 60mm/s, but I highly recommend operating it at it's designed speed of 30mm/s. This will greatly improve precision, and it's much quieter.	- Provided Filament: When you order this printer, order yourself some filament from, I don't know, Hatchbox is a good one. Basically, the filament this thing came with was trash. There were major inconsistencies in the width of the two spools of ABS (red/white) that I received. Initially I was concerned that the printer was the issue, but a lovely spool of blue PLA and a drop to 30mm/s changed my mind very quickly.		Words of Wisdom:	- Kapton tape is your friend. Use it.	- I run mine at 30mm/s for best results, though this was with bad filament. It would probably run alright at higher speeds.	- FlashForge support are your friends. If you have an issue, contact them, and don't give up on this printer. If there is an issue, it's probably something simple, like bad filament or, your fault, something like a misleveled build plate. Whether or not it is one of the above, Tang and his team will see to it that it is fixed very, very quickly.		Edit: T+2.5 years and still running better than ever. If there's one thing to be said for these machines, they're workhorses.		And that's it. Basically, if you need a well-built, reliable printer, look no further.
0,great product ..my goto filament
0,good value
0,Quality fabric and great stick.  Better than the junk tape that is weak and doesn't adhere well.
0,Haven't used any of my prints long enough to have really tested the layer bonding but so far it seems fine. I've used Ninjatek TPU exclusively because it's extremely reliable, and in all the countless spools I've been through have never come across an anomaly like this (see photo). This would not feed into my extruder around 30 meters into my first spool but after checking the rest of it I'm sure it's just anomaly... I hope. Most likely I still check the entire length of future spools as well. I'm convinced this drip got on the line during manufacturing because it's shape suggests it was traveling away from the hot end against gravity.	All in all I'm not discouraged from this band. It's got it's perks in being cheaper and offering a wider color selection. I'll have to give it some time before adjusting my rating up or down.
0,This Bosch oscillating tool is fantastic.  I got this from Vine and it came with the grout tool, before I could fully evaluate the tool I went ahead and bought the sanding pad (to attach the sand paper) and the multi-purpose set (cutting blades and sand paper).  This tool has power to spare.  I have a DeWalt orbital sander that I'm very pleased with, but it can't reach into corners or angled areas on a project.  The Bosch sander had a triangular shaped head that allows it to reach areas that the DeWalt can't.  The Bosch operates and sands just as easily as the DeWalt.  The straight blades took me a several practice uses to get accustom to using an oscillating tool for cutting.  Normally I'll use a rotating or reciprocating type tool, but after a couple of uses on some scrap material I was good to go.  Now, I love the scrapper tool.  I've done a lot of scrapping by hand, this little puppy makes it a lot easier.  Granted to have to be more careful since you don't quite have the feel that you might need on a delicate project, and you have to get accustom to the weight of the tool and the amount of pressure you want on the material.  I took me almost no time to adapt to it.  I've been talking about the tools used on the oscillating took because this is where the bank for the buck comes from on this tool.  It's portable, the battery charges very quickly, and the charge lasted me the whole day.  I have fallen into the routine of charging my battery tools before the next... all because of past experience with other tools.  With the power that I had at the end of the day, I might need to do this with this tool.  Great tool, not too heavy and extremely well made.

0,I used these on some children's art displays to hold on magnetic clips. Once dried, it will NOT come undone which is exactly what I was hoping for. I accidentally hit one of the clips hard and the magnet in the back stayed attached where I glued it and came off where manufacturer glued it to the clip... Guess they should have used Gorilla glue!
0,Worked perfectly for what I was printing. Part snapped right into place with very little post processing. Bright yellow color really stands out against the blue background.
0,I have a PRUSA and with some prints involving glue I've had them welded to the bed. These two tools have a very fine edge that allows you to carefully catch an edge (without damaging the PEI) and work the piece loose enough to get it off. I also bought another tool (off Amazon) but the edge was just a tiny bit thicker (more like a paint scraper) and doesn't work well to start the process, although with a large piece after gaining a little foothold with these tools the larger one can be used.		The longer of the two tools is very flexible so you will probably need to grab it halfway on the blade to apply pressure and guide it. Just some common sense - these blades are sharp and sometimes people apply a lot of force...enough that if something slips you could get a serious injury ("it's just a flesh wound...."). So be patient, work the tools pushing away from you and your other hand and if you find your self straining and grunting, walk away and take a break before you hurt yourself.
0,I got this to test my well along with some litmus strips. It works really well. The problem now is that I'm curious about what all the stuff is it detected in my water as it only shows the amount of dissolved solids in parts per million.

0,Great filament for the price.  Quality seems to be as good or better than anything in the same price range.
0,For years I have used the cheaper fractional calipers for reasons no other than economics.  They worked fairly well, but when my wife pulled away with my last one on the back bumper of our truck a while back - it was time for a new one!  ;-)  I decided this time to bite the bullet and get something that hopefully did not have the drift issues that the cheaper ones I used had... and that it reliably and always returned to zero.		One of my criteria for my woodworking calipers, of course, is that it has fractional as well as decimal readout.  The other is that it is reliable, repeatable and accurate to 1/64th of an inch - and it always returns to zero and does not slowly drift as some of the cheaper ones do.		Well, the Starrett meets the criteria VERY well.  I have used it for almost 9 months now, and it is VERY repeatable in its measurements, always returns to zero, and never drifts out of alignment.  It is built like a tank, and should last a lifetime.... as long as I don't drop it!!!		I must say, it is heavier than I am used to, and I am always paranoid about dropping it! (it's the $100 thing...) I am very aware of where I set it, and try to return it back to its case as soon as possible!		Overall - an easy five stars - a well built, accurate, repeatable caliper with fractional readout for woodworking!!!  Would recommend.
0,Awesome product for a good price. Tests the PH of water within 0.1-0.2 accuracy. Would definitely buy again!
0,GEL is really great. Easy to apply and sticks well.
0,A nice variety of sizes, and reasonably priced.
0,DIY printers can be a lot of work at least now one thing i never need to worry about is my print sticking to the bed (maybe little about taking them off the bed ) every print i tried (even with very small base) i have ever tried with this BuildTak not one it came off	Printed in multiple filaments and never had one come off, sometimes it's hard to get it off but better that then ruined print dew to not sticking
0,Great Product. excellent quality.
0,I give this one 4 stars because I had some problems with this roll in particular.  No problems with other HATCHBOX filaments, both ABS and PLA.  I will definitely come back for HATCHBOX ABS in the future.
0,Puts up about an 18' high stream with reasonable flow.  I have this attached to a water tank for garden irrigation.  So far no problems.
0,loving it
0,The way to go if you brew a lot however definitely buy a storage container as well.
0,Well made, fits correctly, does what it is supposed to do.
0,As they should be... fun stuff to look at. The case they go in is very nice and keeps them safe and easy to get at.
0,Worked straight out of the box with no trouble or damage. I have tested the voltage and it's surprisingly accurate.
0,Got my I3 duplicator printing more consistent.  If you are not printing on a glass bed, then do your research.  Works best with a little bit of hairspray added on top every 5 or so prints.
0,this stuff works fine, nothing wrong but I found you can get the the real deal, "Cargille" brand oil for half this price if you hunt around.
0,This is a great pack of assorted bullet connectors.	I use and prefer these over the spade style connectors all the time. I think bullet connectors give better surface area contact than spade connectors and are less likely to loosen up over time. They are also more compact and easier to use.		This 100 pack comes in a nice plastic organizer that will fit nicely in your drawer or electric tool bag.		You get 5 different colors, that don't follow the standard color to size/AWG format (yellow generally being for larger gauge wire). This limits you to 16Ga wire. You may be able to force a 14Ga wire in there if you shave off a few strands.		For the price this is a better deal than you will find at your auto parts store or your big box stores.		I recommend using a dual wall or adhesive lined heat shrink on every connector (see in my pics, I show a clear adhesive lined heat shrink on one of the finished connectors). This helps keep the wire from pulling out and keeps a lot of the major liquid out of the connector.	A kit like this comes in handy: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NPBUWRC/?tag=cr38er-20		Conclusion:	  Good value for the price. 5 different colors to match your wires.		I have reviewed other products from Sopoby and have been quite satisfied with their quality and value.	Sopoby provided these to GadgetClass for testing and review.
0,I use these for small electronics and hobby-level machining.		GREAT for having around the workbench. At this price there is no fear of dropping, banging or using these to scribe. I zeroed them and worked them a ton--they go right back to zero. I have never seen any variation in measurement and it compares very well to my $150 dollar calipers. Movement is a little grainy and the locking screw feels like it will break off one day. The plastic is cheap and its easy to accidentally hit the buttons. I've heard with cheap calipers the measurements can vary if the battery is low. I haven't experienced this yet.		But for the price to performance ratio I give these calipers 5 stars.
0,Handy tool
0,Exactly as Described. Fast Shipping. Good Price. Couldn't be Happier. Thank you!
0,Nice! A good product from the perspective of a 6 foot tall guy. I bought the Gorilla Gripper for moving ply and drywall around the house for an extensive foundation / renovation project. This is a very sensible way to move heavy, awkward and/or delicate sheet material.		My one trouble area is stairs. With the Gorilla Gripper centered on the sheet of ply, the material obviously wants to hang in a level orientation, so rather than angling the sheet upward to clear the stair tread, I've got to lift it even higher above shoulder level than what is depicted in the stock photos.		Lifting so high is a small strain, inconvenient but do-able outdoors where overhead clearance is unlimited. Inside on a staircase with a low ceiling, this isn't really practical as the upper-back corner of the material will contact the ceiling. (Thank goodness for outside stairs!)		Stairs with tight turns are also a no-go; be prepared to either ask for help or resign yourself to the old slide 'n shuffle method.		For everything other than stairs the Gorilla Gripper has been very satisfactory to use. It's still a lot of work moving 3/4" sheets around all by my lonesome, but at least it's now practical to do so without having to bring in help. No problem recommending this product.
0,Just as advertised
0,Very affordable multimeter, especially considering the DC current tester seems to work great. Fit my generic tester lead assortment perfect. My new go-to tester.
0,It took some looking around to find a proper Windows 10 driver since my computer does not have a DVD drive, but after locating one, this worked perfectly on my PC. Locating an Android app was easier and it plugged right in and worked immediately on my phone. I was a little surprised at the weird angles of the video, but soon figured out how to rotate it so things look normal. This helped me to inspect some engine parts on my motorhome, which are almost impossible to see without something like this.
0,Cleans well, lots of suction - better than our central house vacuum system.  Easy to start (nice easy access button), easy to stand up (nice foot release).  Not overly loud.  Easy to assemble (just need a Philips screwdriver).		This is heavy.  We have lots of stairs, and most of my family will not be carrying it up and down the stairs.  So, this will only be used once and a while when Im around to lift it when we feel that we need to clean extra well, not every time we vacuum.		The orange cord is long enough, but is not retractable, so you need to learn to deal with it, i.e., don't run over it with the vacuum (not hard, but just something to deal with).  The cleaning head is wide, which is good or bad depending on your preference.  If you have a lot to clean, its wide to get the job done faster.  But being wide it does not fit into smaller areas so you end up using the attachments when are not that more effective than our other vacuums.  There is no head light on it.		Its easy to clean, and has an indicator that tells you with colors how the filter it doing (green is OK, red is time to clean).		This goes get stuff that our other vacuum misses so I like it, but not for each time we need to vacuum  its too too big, heavy, for every day needs.
0,Tough stuff.
0,Solders onto PCBs easily and durable. The nut and washer works well.
0,Great product, I've tried a few and won't use anything else now. 2 thumbs up
0,We have a small heated pool in our unheated garage. We used this with a DIY PVC frame to make a small greenhouse to cover it. It kept the heat in during the winter and kept the moisture from damaging the drywall in the garage. Nice heavy weight, and the size was wide enough that I did not have to piece it together. Clear enough to let light in without privacy being an issue.
0,High quality and easy to operate. Many useful features. Fast support
0,Very good. .
0,Wow! 220 Ohms, no less!  And they can take 0.25 W.  Not bad.
0,All part of my centralized dust collector system.  Much easier to use my chop saw and table saw without the mess in my garage.
0,Great value. Does the job.
0,Been using this for over a year and its great. I initially bought just the hotend and not the cooler and experienced some major issues. I was able to get in contact with someone at Micro Swiss and they were really really helpful. They rushed me the cooling block and its been gravy since then. It may be expensive, but its definitely worth it, and customer support is great as well.
0,Perfect.
0,These keep hard and semi-soft cheeses for quite a few weeks in the refrigerator. They don't work well for very soft high-moisture cheeses like fresh mozzarella, though. The bags are easy to use and can be re-used. One minor drawback is that you can't see what's inside.		The only method I've used that keeps cheese longer than these bags is vacuum-sealing, which can keep cheese for months in the refrigerator. However, you have to cut open the package when you want to use it which makes it a bit impractical when you don't need all of the cheese, but of course you could then transfer it to a Formaticum bag.
0,Perfect to guide drills or taps.  I find this very helpful to hold my taps straight.
0,I got this because I needed something to hold up in outside weather conditions for some electrical wire connections for some things I am connecting outside the house. This tape works well holding up to the heat and rain that it is exposed to daily. It is suppose to handle temperatures up to 221 degrees and hopefully it won't get tested to that degree outside. This is very easy to use and easy to apply and reapply. So far, no moisture and protects my wiring very well. I got this for around 4 dollars.
0,Great for handsewing especially denim and leather
0,got these on the rec of op's reviews and they live up to their reputation.  good price, well packaged, perfect.
0,sturdy. reusable.
0,very good
0,If like me  you hate the thin white teflon tape that turns into a string as soon as it comes off the roll and is almost impossible to get to lay flat then you are going to love this teflon tape. It comes in 3 different widths (1/2", 3/4" and 1") It is a thick tape (3-1/2 thousands)thick) which makes it so easy to wrap threads.  It also has a lot of tape on the rolls this 1/2" wide tape has 1429 inches on a roll.  After using the Mil-Rose once I threw the thin cheap tape in the trash because this tape is not only a time saver it does what teflon tape is supposed to do.  I use it everywhere I have threads; air, gas or water.		For gas lines I would suggest doing what my Master Plumber taught me; wrap the threads first with monster tape then brush on a layer of pipe dope over the teflon.  I have done this for many decades and never had a gas leak.
0,exactly as I expected it to be
0,Hatchbox is my go-to filament.  This is my second roll of Flashforge orange.  I wouldn't have bought a second if I didn't love the first! Ive printed through several rolls of their PLA filament on both my Printrbot Simple Metal at home and my Flashforge Creator Pros at work  a middle school classroom.  It prints well on both machines.  I find 205 degrees Celsius to be the optimal temperature for most prints.  Not all prints are perfect but I often find that the issue is more in the model than the filament.  In other words, if my print has flaws when printed with Hatchbox, I can reprint using a different brand and the new print will have the same flaw.		I recommend storing all PLA filament in zip loc bags or other airtight containers, with the silica gel packs tucked inside.  Ive had some rolls for close to a year and they still print flawlessly.
0,EXACTLY what I needed!!
0,when I opened this up it was a bit smaller than expected but I am very happy with this purchase. It works immediately (after you put the AA batt. in)
0,I'm pleasantly surprised at how well this tool holds calibration. I was very skeptical after 3 sets of electronic calipers failed me, but this gauge is a different animal. I have to zero it each use, but it holds calibration for at least the duration of the current task.
0,Great & easy to tap for my vehicle electrical projects! You can disconnect for trace or interchange connection if required!
0,To begin, I'm not an engineer or an electrician.  I'm a computer nerd and dabble in electronics only so far as it interfaces with computing devices.		For instance, breadboarding stuff off of a raspberry pi.  That sort of thing.		Can not say enough positive things about this assortment.		It comes in a cardboard box, but unlike a lot of other ways to buy resistors, these are in little plastic bags with the value of the resistors written on the bag.		For those familiar, resistors are color-coded, but franky, my eyes are old and these markings can be a big sloppy.  Hard to see without a magnifying glass and even then, sometimes hard to tell the colors apart.  PLUS, then you have to go to a chart and try and calculate the value.		SOOOOO much easier to have them in bags with the value printed on the bags.		I tested a few of these with a multimeter.  They tested out close enough to the listed Ohm rating.		All in all, a great deal for the electronics hobbyist.  (Or maybe even professional... I wouldn't know anything about that.)		For the price, well worth it and will save you a lot of time when you're trying to find a 220 ohm resistor or whatnot.
0,Works ok, I guess.  Hard to know if the cord is good.
0,Great
0,Within tolerances, work well.  Nice package of resistors.
0,good deal!
0,Have not used this yet- but happy to have on hand if needed.
0,works fine, affordable pH meter
0,This unit is well made and powerful.  Just the thing for keeping healthy teeth and gums.  I like the power and versatility of the flosser.
0,Their ink is fantastic. We use it on a M3D Micro
0,Im a soap maker & I use these to measure my essential oils. Needed this a long time ago.
0,I bought a ROBO 3D R1 back in June I believe.	It printed well out of the box. I later replaced the hotend with a E3D v6 and in the process blew the MOSFET for the hotend.	It was totally my fault, I contacted support told them what happened and was expecting a small package with a MOSFET in it.	What I got was BOTH new boards, Totally beyond what I expected.	Get the newer ROBO 3D Plus, it has some upgrades like leadscrew in place of the threaded rods. Far more stable IMO	Kudos to the guys at ROBO 3D
0,Nice caliper.
0,Comparison to dynarex gloves.  The records show I paid little over $9 in 2012 for Dynarex.  Diamond gloves are superior, although about $2 more.  These gloves stretch less and feels tougher plastic.  It felt less elastic and a bit less easier to put on, but once on, these gloves were less tight around the hand and more comfortable.  I use these gloves during the weekend car repairs, oil changes.  Although I haven't used these yet, I feel these will not tear as easily.  Will report if I got it wrong.
0,Love this stuff for.my black painted iron fence. Keeps the water off and every couple weeks I clean and wipe down with this for fresh new look
0,This garbage can fits right in our garbage cupboard perfect. A big and clean step up.
0,It's cheap, small and it works! What else could you ask for? I would buy it again.
0,Arrived on time, works as advertised.  I only test line power, clocks, oscillators, timers and generators from 0-400 Hz.  Will suit most needs for industrial, automotive and power and generation equipment. A great supplement or portable alternative to your bench equipment or as a cheap interim alternative while you are researching and saving for a bench type oscilloscope and the price is right.  I was surprised how easy it is to set up and use.  Good for beginners and project board enthusiasts.
0,great item for lab work. Would definitely purchase again.
0,works as expected
0,It is now 10/2017) and I purchased my printer in 2014.. Sooner or later you will want to try other types of filaments. For the most part, the printer has held up well and I have learned a lot about 3D printing. The machine is not perfect and I have had my share of jammed filaments and bad prints. Recently, I was getting constant filament jams and was baffled by the cause. I ended up replacing the heads and PTFT tubes and that did not eliminate the problem. I soon discovered the issue that contributed to the jams was related to the filament on the spool. I noticed the problem seems to happen frequently when the filament was nearing the end on the spool about 1/4 of material left on the spool. I noticed the filament was wound pretty tight as it got less and less and it was just enough so the feed mechanism could pull it. So, I started unwinding the filament on spool by hand to make it real loose.  Sure enough, this reduced the problem. All in all it is good. I am going to sell this printed and get a Raise3D later on.		I worked with many 3D printers (Cube, Makerbot Replicator and RepRap) and did weeks of research before deciding on this one. It was down to Flashforge Pro and Printrbot Metal Plus. I gave up the 10X10X10 bed size on the Printrbot for this smaller one due to the reviews I read from other people. Also, the new printrbot just came out and had no history or review and I am not sure if this a real company or a garage operations.	Anyway, got the Flashforge and did a couple of prints that were way off. The edges lifted of like crazy. Finally, after some experimentation I was able to get the object to come out near perfect. There is no such thing as 100% perfections with 3D printers.	My setting will vary from yours but this is what I used. I live is Florida and the unit is in my garage where the ambient temp is abut 70+	Rule #1:  Level, level, level and then level again	PLA --  heat bed set at 70C	Extruder temp set at 220 C	Speed was adjusted to 45/55-60	Right as the temp reaches 190, I spray some super hold hair spray on a soft cloth and apply it to the bed outline the area of print. Be careful the bed is hot.	I used the Kapton tape that came with the bed. I did try blue tape but took it out.	I printed a object about 7 inches long by .25H x .25 D for test.  The edge tolerances were about .03 mm to .05 mm off. I believe this was probably due to the bed not being level. But the quality was really great. I just have to make some minor adjustment but it should be okay.	Overall, I have to say that 3D printers are not plug and play like some people think. It does require a lot of it of patience.	My FabLab is now complete. 3d printer, CNC machine and other cool equipment.
0,I use these with my pond master pump, works great with 12mm ID tubing, it is actually designed for 13 mm tubing but I heat the tube in boiling water so that the 12 mm tubing will fit. This creates a very air tight seal
0,Perfect! A little odd that it changes from pink to white when dry, but it does dry quickly and really blends in with my slightly off-white walls. This works well with the Red Devil plastic putty knife from Amazon.
0,This does what it was supposed to do.  I used a UV pen and the WJL-6000 detector to find the leaks in A/C system in my wife's car.  The UV pen provided a visual as to the general areas (when the system has UV dye).  I then used the WJL-6000 to confirm that both hi side and low side Schrader valves were leaking. I still have another tiny leak to find, as replacing the Schader valves slowed the leak from draining the system overnight to a 3-5 day system drain.	Big thing with this is FOLLOW DIRECTIONS for use.  Keep the sensor head about " from any surface.  Don't run the engine during testing.  Ensure the system has a charge.
0,Good for daily maintenance
0,This is great for holding heavy items in a lathe. Its big, strong, strudy, and well built. For those turning logs or other heavy wood it works great.
0,TMD-50: Caveat emptor.  The description here states that the meter will read up to 2498 deg F.  This may be generalized information pertaining to other models in this series, but it does not apply to the TMD-50.  This meter has a "3 1/2 character display, so the left character can be nothing or "1".  This means that the maximum number displayed is 1999, as is stated in the owner manual that ships with the device.  You can probably measure up to 2498 deg F with this device, but you have to do it in Celsius and do the conversion math to Fahrenheit. Of course, the two thermocouples shipped with the unit would melt at anything approaching that upper temperature, so you have to buy a specific pyrometer thermocouple separately to read that high (for use in a kiln, etc).  Most people likely understand that though.	Of note as well, is that you can calibrate the unit- e.g., stick the thermocouple in boiling water and set it to read that boiling point temperature.  You can not do this in Fahrenheit though.  If you press the "Adj" button to adjust it, nothing happens.  If you switch to Celsius display, viola, it works and you can adjust to 100 deg C, then switch back to Fahrenheit.	All of this was a bit too much for me, even though I know and use Celsius, I live and work in the US where most everything is in Fahrenheit, and I feel that this MFG should have designed/ modified this unit to work here.  It is clearly a European device (German company) that was slightly modified to work in F so it could be sold here.	I contacted Amprobe customer service, Fluke personnel responded (though none answered my questions) so this is likely imported to/ sold here in the US by Fluke as a lower cost alternative to their higher priced units.	On the bright side, it is very well made, quality materials, quality display, quality buttons, etc.  Seems like it will last and give good service.	I returned this and paid a few dollars more for the next model up that has a 5 digit display, hopefully I can measure temperatures in Fahrenheit up to the stated limit.
0,Nice heavy duty strap with good stitching. Seems more than strong enough to keep my kayak safely in place atop the old wagon. The protective cover over the buckle is a big plus relative to bare-buckle straps if you value the finish of your car. It's padded, with a no-scratch material, to protect the surface under it. Another reviewer commented on the difficulty of threading the other end of the strap through the padding, but if you just roll the bottom part of the padding back a bit you can thread through the loose end without any problem, then just roll the padding back again. One downside of this design is that only the bottom side of the buckle is padded. I prefer the straps that came with my Thule Hull-a-Port, which have a rubber jacket that slides down to completely cover the buckle. The Thule design offers full protection when I throw the buckle end of the strap all the way over the top of the car. But relatively to bare-buckle straps, the Keeper Koastal is a big improvement at a modest premium.
0,Good value
0,Work great for adding spiced oils to my hard candy-making process. Can be rinsed and used again.
0,I did next day shipping due to a blown transformer in the Florida summer heat. My 15+ year old Rheem air handler lost its transformer in a flurry of lightning strikes.	Worked perfectly out of the box using the 240 primary. 28V with no load on the secondary side.		The item says its 75VA but it is actually only 50VA. It didn't affect me but it could be a problem for others.
0,Holds very well, but the surface must be completely dry before applying.  I was hopeful I could use this to make a spot repair on our hot tub, but before it would stick, I had to drain some of the water from the unit.  Once dry, the tape has held fast for one week and that bodes well for the future.  Normally anything that holds underwater for a day will continue to hold.
0,Very strong. Well constructed.  Fits well in my slatwall (Dakota brand), even fits well with the aluminum inserts in the rails.		Buy it for what it is, not for what you think you can make it do.  I can put a coiled garden hose, or two compressor hoses, or a ladder, etc.  Trying to put strange objects on there (creeper, leaf blower, dust collection system) will work, but there are probably better options.
0,Just what I needed...
0,I don't remember this one as i order and use a lot of parts daily.
0,Works in some unexpected ways. I have several requirements for duct tape and use it fairly often for non-standard jobs.  My first requirement is that it has to tear by hand with relative ease.  This tape is thick and strong but will tear by hand once I get it started with a fingernail.  Some thinner tapes tear very easily but aren't strong  and some won't tear at all--neither suits my needs.  I need a heavy, strong tape that sticks very well and is also relatively easy to handle.  I've used Gorilla tape and find this is better.		Vets recommend duct tape to create sort of a protective boot over a horse's hoof when there is an infection that's being treated.  Getting the tape on a  big moving critter isn't easy, so the tearing and unrolling part has to work really well, but the tape also  has to be super strong and stay stuck.  This stuff does that really hard job better than any I've used.  I have not found it so sticky that it's difficult to work with, but it stays stuck to itself well.  On the other hand, when I pull off a longer piece it makes me really mad if whatever  tape I'm using  gets stuck to itself and I can't get it free so I can wrap it as intended.  It surprised me that with this tape,  I can get it to release when I want it too but it doesn't come unstuck when sealed intentionally.  I still haven't figured that out.  I'm certainly not complaining though.		Because it stays where  I put it, I used it to tidy my desk by creating small hanging 'pouches' to hold pens, scissors and such.  I pull off a length of tape and fold it back on itself leaving about an inch with the sticky side showing.  I pull up the bottom of the double stuck section and stick it to the top making a pouch of whatever size I need, and also leaving about .5" to stick to the side of my desk.  I now have a long row of these holding miscellaneous items.  I need to insert and remove the item held by the pouch often and not have the pouch come unstuck, but also I  can pull the pouches off the wood if I want and no residue is left.  The wood is not damaged.  It makes a sort of 'Command Strip' removable (or not) holder for various items, including my reading glasses, a small flashlight, and  a bulky extra camera battery in addition to pens.  My next project is to make a row of these little pouches for the back of my bathroom door to hold tubes of make up, brushes  and such.  Wish the tape  came in other colors than black for that purpose though.  So far, none of my holders has come loose.  Most of the items stored in the pouches probably don't need the strength of the tape, but it does matter that the tape stays stuck, even in damp conditions.		This is useful, heavy tape that is easy to handle and meets multiple needs.  I'll re-buy as needed.
0,Here is a side by side photo of this HTC-2LM compared to the HTS-2L model.  Both have extra long telescoping handles of the same length.  The only difference is that the HTC-2LM has a 2-1/4" diameter mirror and the HTS-2L has a 3-1/4" diameter mirror.  These inspection mirrors are so useful to have handy for the odd projects when you least expect you might need them, I bought both.  On the package it says these are manufactured by Ullman Tools in Connecticut.  In other words, this is Made in the USA and not Made in China - another plus!
0,Easy set up and operation. Seems a tad low on humidity, compared to my weather station. That may even out after a bit.
0,great

0,I do a lot of homemade burgers using a burger press.  I keep everything separated with the patty paper and have never had a problem with dispensing or using the PP.
0,Worked awesome as a temp controller form my fermentation chamber. Was concerned about the 10 amp rating but so far so good. Gonna build another using this unit.
0,Nice, consistent photo resistors.
0,Amazing.....thanks !
0,Works great so far. Bought as a better means of checking temps on wood-stove flue pipe, and stove top. Lots of other uses too, very handy to have. I have bought other products by this mfr. and they seem to be good quality for the price.
0,well made
0,Nice LEDs, bought for a UT fan to light up a license plate me and my friend made for her Jeep from my home built CNC. So far all have worked and can in a bag with specs. 3rd time I have bought LEDs from CHANZON and have not been disappointed yet. Thank you for a great product.
0,Great quality and perfect fit into PVC. The strainer also fits fine right into the bulkhead snugly. Half the price of many other pieces online; would buy again.

0,3-IN-ONE 120070 Lock Dry Lube, 2.5 oz, Clear		I have several gates, both walk through and drive thru on my property, all of which have a lock on each. These locks are exposed to all types of weather and corrosion situations. I saw this Lock Dry Lube and jumped on it right away. Giving my many locks a squirt of WD40 or spray silicone just doesnt do the trick for very long. I found myself having to always monitor my outdoor padlocks.		With this Lock Dry Lube, a single squirt last for weeks on end. My locks don't rust, or get corroded by weather. When I insert the key, the lock functions like it brand new and no oily residue on the key.		This stuff really works great. The can is small, but with how long it last to protect and lubricate locks, you just don't need a huge can, its that good. Its made by the folks at WD40, but made specifically for lubing and protecting locks. Money well spent!
0,Good stuff
0,Super for extending drains on hard to reach air tanks.
0,Hatchbox is my go-to filament.  I received some Blue filament with my Flashforge but really didn't care for the color - it's almost a dull shade of blue.  Hatchbox blue is so bright and vibrant!  Makes great prints!!  Ive printed through several rolls of their PLA filament on both my Printrbot Simple Metal at home and my Flashforge Creator Pros at work  a middle school classroom. It prints well on both machines. I find 205 degrees Celsius to be the optimal temperature for most prints. Not all prints are perfect but I often find that the issue is more in the model than the filament. In other words, if my print has flaws when printed with Hatchbox, I can reprint using a different brand and the new print will have the same flaw. When this happens, making adjustments to the print settings (layer height, print speed, temperature) often helps.		I recommend storing all PLA filament in zip loc bags or other airtight containers, with the silica gel packs tucked inside. Ive had some rolls for close to a year and they still print flawlessly.		I try to write helpful, concise reviews for all of my Amazon purchases. If you found this to be helpful, please let me know by clicking yes below. Thank you!
0,It looks fantastic as a print, it works really well with filament swapping as a secondary color, I used it as the side of the cradle for my Pebble, and as a material to make a fun novelty wineglass for a friend.
0,I purchased this to keep track of the humidity in my home when I was replacing my whole-house humidifier. It works very well and is small enough to put on any shelf. I like the fact that it keeps track of the temperature and humidity for the last 24 hours, so that I can see how well my system is working overall.
0,I purchased this after achieving good results with the EndRot kit. I'm very pleased with the results on my termite-damaged window sill and frame.		Here are two tips that will help you:	  1. One of the videos mentions that you can apply the SculpWood while the RotFix is still tacky. Take advantage of this: It speeds the job considerably, and helps you get the SculpWood to stick to the wood deep in all the cracks and crevices.	  2. Build up the SculpWood putty above the surface of your repair as shown in the directions. Then wait 12-24 hours and carve the excess away with a sharp chisel. This is MUCH faster and easier than sanding after it dries. The consistency is like a raw potato at this point: easy to carve with a chisel just by pushing it through the excess material to the shape you want.		I did not try the thinner SculpWood Paste version of this product, because my projects involved lots of vertical surfaces and several places where it was necessary to push putty up overhead into holes. My next project involves some outside structure repairs where the paste might be a better solution.
0,Looks like green crystal! Prints at 240 celcius like crystal. Very very strong and can be stringy if you do not set up your retraction settings. The best filament I have ever printed with. I will be buying more. A lot more. WARNING IF YOU PRINT TOO HIGH TEMP ON BUILDTAK YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REMOVE THE MATERIAL FROM THE BUILDTAK. Especially the Blue FF Buildtak!		update: if you print high temp filament like this, you will need to use some ESun Filament cleaner to remove the high temp stuff from the drive gear and the inner tubing. If this is neglected, there is a chance your lower temp filament, when loaded, will clogg the extruder.
0,Great.
0,A+++, will buy again from he seller
0,works as expected.
0,This is a nice set that is very cost effective for someone needing multiples of the same size.  It depends on your use, but my use was for sharpening my chainsaw.  I used another set that seems to be of same manufacturer due to details of the case it comes in and it had one of each of 4 sizes.  That set had noticeably more coarse diamond grit and cut much faster and still left a sharp tooth to cut with.  These fine ones do the same but it takes longer and I think you have to be more careful to not generate heat that will melt the adhesive that binds the diamonds to the face of the hohe as you need to hone longer and it heats up more due to that, also taking longer.  So take your time and lubricate and cool with oil, water or wd40 or similiar.  They will last much longer if you do.  Don't yield to the temptation to rev it up to cut faster or soon you'll have a bare hone that does nothing.		If manufacturer offers a matched set like this with more coarse diamonds, they should sell here on amazon and differentiate the grit size so people can buy the rigth ones for their application.  These finer diamonds are undoubtedly the right thing for some applications, but not for mine.  So hopefully seller will see this and offer various grits in a matched set that is like the 4 different ones for chainsaw sharpening.  They work well.  THis does too, but not as well.
0,Great!
0,Truly awesome filament, we have bought several rolls from this manufacturer and each one of them keeps the quality we are looking for, also the price is right and comes well packaged. Will certainly buy again.
0,nice
0,good product
0,Perfect!  THANKS!
0,I was happy with these. I had to stare at the rack for a few minutes to figure out how to snap it together but maybe that was just me! They arrived loose in a package but remarkably mine looked fine and were not scratched up. I soaked them in warm soapy water and they dried easily without spots. We used them to hold mini M&M's for a science party and they were perfect for that. I was completely pleased.
0,These little controllers are great, I have over a dozen of them, I use them on egg hatching incubators, egg storage refrigerators and fans in my chicken & turkey houses. Simple to wire up and simple to configure.
0,Fast shipping and this product will work for putting boric acid around the house and behind places that I can't spray. Made my job alot easier.
0,This is the most serious tape i have ever used. Wow!
0,Great trim for front of Jeep.
0,This is such a useful tool!  We have various animals, and it is not always easy to get a body temp reading. While it isn't exactly the right temp, it gives a non- invasive way to get a clue. Also used it for other things like household electronics to see of our cell phone batteries are getting too hot.
0,Very consistent readings.  So handy to have around.
0,They work just as they should.
0,Works very well.  The switch is a bit stiff, and it's easy to miss the "fast" setting because of that (3 position slide switch), but it does the job.
0,I needed several of these to hook up 1/2" hoses with barbs to a 3/8" Ball Valve, worked perfectly.  They are 1 1/4" long with very clean threads. Highly recommended to go from 3/8" to 1/2".
0,My house seems to go thru these every 3-4 years I stay with same brand ,makes it easy to switch out . think it might be the city water maybe.
0,wasnt as transparent as planed still worked but ended up changing out after a while
0,After buying several off-brand spools of PLA, all I experienced were problems. I experienced popping/bubbling, grinding (due to inconsistent diameter), and filament would even break off as it was being fed into my printer. I then did some research and decided to try out HATCHBOX PLA. For the price, there is no better filament. I have gone through two spools so far and I've had zero issues! The colors are also quite vibrant, which is definitely and added bonus. Thank you HATCHBOX for producing quality filament at an affordable price!
0,works just fine
0,Excellent product would buy again.
0,Pretty small and husband removed and smoothed them all up so they are nicer..but they really aren't too bad for a general and generic kind of tweezers. They do seem to be anti static too. I'd buy again for the low price but they are very short just warning you.
0,Used for increasing rigidity on my 3D printer which is made from 2020 extrusions. Did the job, now the frame is super rigid.
0,Delivered on time and rust free. Good quality mild steel.
0,Very strong and cool look with the clarity, but I've experienced extremely poor layer adhesion without a heated enclosure. Bit of a waste of money for engineering purposes.
0,LOVED THIS WIRE, I USED IT ALL UP, THANKS!!
0,Use this for brew mashing. I like the long stem. Reacts quickly to measure temperature.
0,2 inches is even more solid than 1 inch. It somehow feels shorter than described, but the strength is great I'm not complaining.
0,just wtat I needed.
0,Second one I have ordered they work great.
0,Great deal
0,Good stuff.
0,This is good stuff,works great
0,I have two of these and they both wok great. So easy to monitor. These are very important for gun safes. A must buy if you have one.
0,Good quality great price
0,great vise for a DIYer - thankful I went with this over other options on the market.
0,Worked great as a replacement. Looks just like the one that failed. Installation was easy.		My old one looked fine but leaked water so the valve was stuck open, this solved the problem cheaply and easily.
0,This is the first time I ever tried using this product.  It definitely will not be the last time I use it.  It makes for a very professional looking finished project.
0,Works great, compact size.
0,I don't know how this stuff works, but you will be able to drill holes you never could before. Makes the bit cut long spirals of steel, even with a dulled bit! Great stuff!
0,Labeled exactly as described. Would purchase again.
0,Purchased a toothbrush June 26th of 2015. The toothbrush was great until it stopped charging about a month ago. I would have given it a single star but I contacted Philips and they are sending me another handle with no questions asked so it gets 4.
0,Nice quality cart.  Went together easily, however it was missing about half the washers.  Not a big deal as I always have spare washers.  Recommend.
0,It is Great and very useful
0,They work fine, but don't expect long range or precision.  These units are comparable with HC4's offered by other suppliers.  I found no duds in this SunFounder brand.  That's always a worry with inexpensive sensors.	I used a total of 14 in an obstacle avoidance robot project workshop.  They all worked to spec.	If you need high performance, I suggest using the considerably more expensive Parallax HC5 version.
0,Product arrived on time and was what I expected.
0,Great purity. Had lots of oxidized colors. I bought more...
0,I ordered these to transfer essential oils. They are graduated in 5 ml increments up to 30 ml and are accurate enough for my needs.  They are inexpensive enough that I can toss them when I'm done. Very happy with this product!
0,i only purchase solutech filaments - iv never had issues with any of the colors - they are true to color - and print very fluid.
0,Had not realized that by "yellow and blue" they basically meant that the first line is yellow and everything else blue... but cool nonetheless :)
0,Works great, have used on two projects with no problems.
0,What I received looked like huge reel of double sided foam tape. It is about the circumference of plate charger and reminds me of an oversized frisbee. My husband saw it and immediately used it to insulate a couple of doors to block heat loss and block bugs from migrating into the house. Does it work?  Well there are no gaps between the door frame and the door. If bugs can squeeze through, I'm not sure where or how. There are no drafts or unexpected air gaps. My husband likes this tape, especially it's adhesive properties. I can see it working in several places around the home.
0,So easy to use. Strip 1/2" of wire and insert into connector. Solid copper removes with a twist if necessary. Stranded however does not. Takes up less space than wire nuts, especially helpful in tight boxes.
0,Works well
0,No issues
0,good assortment, fair price
0,Works well, well made accurate
0,Works well and is compatible with CFL and LED lamps.  During the day, this product draws about 3 watts of power to heat its internal bi-metalic switch, so its not the most energy efficient.  I mounted mine with the threaded connector pointing down in to a junction box.  Thus far, i haven't had any water intrusion issues.
0,Worked well
0,Using it for Glock slides, seems to be what the factory was using. Also applied this to Mossberg 500 and M&P 9 where metal to metal contact was apparent to further smooth action and reduce fiction.
0,No these are far above in quality from the fuzzy little things. They REALLY dampen the sound, don't hesitate to let go of the door when it's half open, these bumpers are awesome, attractive too. I recommend them highly. I had the doors off, and with a Forstner bit in my drill press, I drilled maybe a 32nd of an inch, just BECAUSE ! You don't have to.
0,required for good metal work
0,I've only used one of the bits and it worked really well.  These seem to be the same quality that I have been paying a dollar a piece for locally.
0,they all the same
0,I know.  It's just a flat washer, right?  So what's to review?  I'll tell ya':  Sent in clearly labeled, heavy clear plastic sleeve.  Shipped in tear-proof bubble envelope.  Thickness of washers exactly correct; not too thin, not too thick.  Dimensions, both inner diameter and outer diameter exactly correct.  Good hard, shiny stainless steel.  No rough edges from stamping.  I've been disappointed repeatedly with hardware items bought on the internet.  These did not disappoint.
0,caliphers are great for measuring small items around the table saw, router, planer etc these caliphers seem to work great.
0,A+
0,Love it. Filament Works amazing. I was able to print fine. I have a dremel 3d20 idea builder with no heated build plate and it works fine. I also love how they give clips to store the filament string with. Keeps it from getting tangled. There is also lots of information cards inside and silica gell. It's also cool how they give stickers. Now just to find what to do with all the spools. Maybe Christmas lights holders?
0,Works great!
0,We love this stuff! We use it in the garden for ground cover. We will buy this again.
0,just a described.
0,Used on drawer bottoms and works great .
0,It sticks. great deal.
0,Use this with my router table.  Never had any issues.
0,Such an amazing toothbrush. My teeth like they do after I go to the dentist. Highly recommend
0,2nd review, where do they go? I like the controller it is small, simple, easy to hook up and highly visible display. There is also a minimum hassle	getting it programmed but typical of Chinese products the instructions are not good. Get online and watch the video instructions-- remember	after doing the Set/Function/Set/program parameters,  to press the power button which STORES the temp parameter you set!	Cannot address longevity but so far it is running well and keeping the temp stable.
0,Use on zippers of popup greenhouse - keeps the working.
0,Works great
0,seem good quality
0,A++++++
0,It was hard to figure out which device, or kit, or strips to purchase to test my water PH levels.	I read many reviews and am very happy that I chose this one.  It works great.
0,Great for our home bathroom. The towels are cost effective and I recommend the GP 23000 C fold towels, they stay tucked inside the dispenser instead of hanging out, in a steamy environment
0,love this stuff. It works on all but some oily feeling plastics..
0,Sticky, excellent for various purposes, such as taping area rugs to tile.
0,Could not find a 3D model match.
0,very useful
0,As Advertised
0,Ordered these screw for my honey's piano hinge project.  The screws are well made, they gripped tight into the wood, they screwed in smoothly, and not a single head was stripped out.  My honey is so happy with these screws he ordered an additional set for other projects.  These number 4 screws have now been through two rainstorms and they look beautiful.		Finally, the price on Amazon is exceptionally low compared to our local hardware stores and we saved the 30 minute drive to get these.  This was an awesome opportunity for me to show my honey to always check Amazon for the little stuff before taking the time to make a trip to the hardware store.
0,I love this filament! It prints perfectly and looks wonderful. I did discover that I need a tad more retraction than I usually need with solid PLA. Once I got that dialed in I haven't had any issues.
0,work great
0,This Product you need.
0,I use these along with 2-gallon ziplock bags to store my 3D printing filament.  These desiccant packs are much larger than a standard pack that you would get with something shipped to you and there are 50 of them in here.  I use like 5 per roll of filament and it's more than sufficient to keep the filament from going bad.
0,Good gloves. I use them for oil changes, food prep, and cleaning unsanitary items.
0,Works wonderfully to remove gasket material from my engine, without scuffing the mating surface.
0,Used to pull a 700 lb load worked great
0,Item as described.
0,Used to pump hot water ( up to 180*F) for Sous Vide cooking.  Wanted a strong heat resistant tube, this fits the bill.  Went to 1/8" wall thickness fo avoid potential leaks.  Case as 1-10' piece.
0,An excellent scope, loaded with features, and expandable through software upgrades if you need more features. A nice way to only pay for what you need. The fan is noticeable, but not terribly loud. The interface is very intuitive and well thought out.
0,As expected. Excellent scouring pads.		Finest pads available, one notch finer than 0000 steel wool.
0,good product good service
0,Works better then I though it would.
0,My husband uses this daily in our auto repair shop to pinpoint and identify certain noises coming from a vehicle to aid him in diagnostics and repairs.  This works just as good as a doctor's stethoscope if not better.  Lisle is a brand we trust in our line of work and are never disappointed in the quality or performance of the brand.  This works great and we would purchase again!
0,I use these as containers to separate my vintage watch parts, like watch movements, gears, wheels, Vintage pocket watches, and movements, hands, and Dials, plus other parts. It makes it easier to take what I need to weigh them, when I sell my Parts at http://www.etsy.com/shop/aim4goodies.
0,Strengths:		* Rapid and accurate measurement updates	* One-Shot and Continuous measurements	* Adjustable emission settings for different surfaces	* Displays Min, Max, and Average values of multiple measurements	* Simple and intuitive user interface	* Solid construction		Weaknesses:		* LCD backlight could be brighter and more uniform	* Shallow LCD vertical viewing angle		Full review:		The Amprobe IR-720 is the best Infrared Thermometer I have used in a long time. What makes this product so useful is its speed and ease of configuration. The IR-720 comes on instantly when the trigger is pulled and delivers an accurate measurement in a fraction of second with updates every second after that. The best thermocouples can take between 3 and 20 seconds to settle into an accurate reading depending on temperature.  With the IR-720 all you have to do is point and shoot.  The user interface is so simple I did not need to read the manual except to make sure I understood the spot size and the emission factor table. Every option provided on the IR-720 is immediately useful and intuitive. If you haven't used an IR Thermometer before, the IR-720 is the best product to start with in my opinion.		I took measurements on every surface I could find including sheetrock walls, un-insulated steam pipe, 400 Amp 480V 3-Phase busway, 5000 Amp DC stacked copper bus bars, DC and AC switch gear, 120V breakers, stove heating elements, the engine of my car, and orange juice in the refrigerator. Some of these I could get a thermocouple on without a safety risk and measurements were initially accurate to between 5% and 18% of the thermocouple reading. When I calibrated the IR-720 using the emission table in the manual, measurements were consistently accurate to within 5% to 7% of the thermocouple reading which I attribute to the difference between the point-contact format of the thermocouple, accuracy of each meter, and the spot size of the IR-720. Accuracy will vary depending on the type of surface being measured, and it is very important to understand the relationship between spot size and target distance. Once I got familiar with the IR-720 and the emission values appropriate for the target, I could take an accurate measurement every time.		The target does not have to be hot. Temperature measurements in a refrigerator or freezer are just as accurate. Liquids in glass containers work really well. Just remember that the temperature measurements on transparent surfaces are the temperature of the surface, not the object visible behind the surface. The manual states that you can't take accurate measurements of objects behind glass, plastic, or plexi-glass. I have tried it and can confirm that the manual is correct.		The Amprobe IR-720 includes a built-in laser pointer that comes on each time the trigger is pulled. The laser can be enabled or disabled based on your preference or optical safety situation. The LCD backlight automatically comes on when scanning occurs but can also be disabled based on your preference. The IR-720 includes a 1/4-20 UNC tripod mount and a "trigger lock" mode that allows you to take MIN, MAX, and AVERAGE measurements over a full temperature cycle instead of trying to hold the meter in just the right place for an hour.  Just mount the IR-720 on a standard camera tripod, turn off the LCD backlight, lock the tripod so the IR-720 is aimed at the target, turn off the laser pointer, select "trigger lock" mode and let it run.  The IR-720 then has the stability and battery power to do a hands-free temperature cycle check over an extended period of time and deliver the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures observed for the cycle.		The IR-720 is nicely constructed with a matte somewhat rubberized finish that feels secure and comfortable in the hand. The trigger feels very solid, has a short travel, and provides a positive click tactile feedback. All of the controls are simply and clearly marked and easy to understand. You won't need the manual to start using this tool but I recommend reading it anyway to fully understand how to take the most accurate IR measurement. The LCD display provides large numbers for its size and is easy to read. My only complaint is that the LCD has a narrow vertical viewing angle of about 20 degrees above the perpendicular when indoors. Horizontal viewing angle left to right and vertical viewing angle below the perpendicular is very good at over 45 degrees in all three directions. The LCD is very stable with no unusual blinking or fading during updates. The LCD backlight is a bit dim in my opinion but is more than sufficient in low light situations. The IR-720 includes a black nylon canvas carrying holster with a belt loop and holster strap that snaps in place.		I initially used the IR-720 to look for overheating in switch gear, busway, and breaker panels at sites I have to travel by air to get to. An accurate thermometer that is compact, rugged, and inexpensive is important to me because I need to carry tools in my checked luggage. A $1500 IR camera is overkill for my purposes and far too risky for the travel I do. Using the IR-720 I can quickly scan for overloaded circuits in a load center, spot-check compressor motor and coolant line temperatures, find loose joints and plug connections in busway, and check for ventilation hot spots in data center bays and equipment racks. For about $100 it's the best way I've found to perform quick and accurate temperature surveys in a data center or equipment room.  The IR-720 is much faster and more convenient than a thermocouple meter.		If you need to take a lot of measurements in a short period of time, or you need a hands-free way to measure average/min/max of a long duration temperature cycle, and you don't want to bother with wiring up a thermocouple, the IR-720 is the best way to go.
0,must have for any shop
0,Pretty much what I expected
0,These modules work perfectly. Since A4988 is well documented, I got it up and running in less than 15 minutes.		If you're like me and use a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor, you must perform a little modification to make it work. Since 28BYJ-48 is unipolar and this is a polar driver module. You can search on google for more information.
0,works great
0,Perfect
0,Good job
0,I love these piggy backs. They really help to cut down on wiring and make installations a breeze. I give them a 4 star because they are not vinyl which I prefer as the insulator is less likely to split while crimping and nylon withstands the heat better. But for minor applications where heat is not an issue....they are great. They come in a fairly nice box with snap lid closures which is a nice touch and helps to keep them organized and secure. You can't beat the price.
0,Good didn't shed for me
0,Worked as advertised. Would buy again.
0,Love these slightly elastic "stick to themselves" wraps. They do not stick to skin or clothing. Come individually wrapped, a variety of colors, not sure why...
0,perfect size for outdoor curtains.
0,The 3M film disc 375L, 150 grade sanding disk works as it should. This is a loop and hook system that stays on with no problem. The grit lasts for a reasonable time like most other good sanding disks. It is easy to put on and take off while working, as I need to change grits. I am really a fan of many 3M products. I use their dust masks without exception and I found the Super Strength adhesive to be the best all purpose cement on the market.	The 3M sanding disks are very good and I will get them again.
0,Good hole filler - forget the vinyl stuff that takes forever to harden.  This stuff was rock hard in four hours.  The only caveat is that it does not work in like concrete, and is slightly darker.  I just wanted the hole filled, so it was fine by me.
0,Works Well
0,Really good bench power supply for the money.  Wish the knobs had detents for more precise control of voltage.  Now its a twiddling teh knobs until you get accurate readout.
0,These syringes are incredibly useful in the kitchen, the garage and shop. I never realized how much I needed these until I started using them.
0,Item as described arrived on time thanks.
0,Fantastic medical penlight for pupillary reflex! Bright, light, clips securely into white coat front pocket. Love it.
0,Years ago I found an interesting old wooden box in my parents' basement that had some pieces of very precise looking machine tools in them and I had no idea what they were but they were carefully packed in sawdust, so I knew then had some value. I asked my father he said they were the taps that my grandfather used to thread pipes in his plumbing work and that he had learned his craft working on, believe it or not, steam railroads. I got kind of fascinated by the concept over the years learned how to fix and repair old pipe threads. I'm not particularly good at it but I have to say it's a still a pretty interesting hobby and comes in quite handy at times.		I'm just using these to clean up some rusty old threads as I work my way around the basement plumbing but they're very high in quality. These taps are extremely well machined and they seem exceedingly sharp to me. I still kind of prefer working with the taps that my grandfather used long before I was born, but it's nice to add some nice new ones to that set. One thing I've learned about doing this is to be patient try to keep the taps going in very straight and use the force you need, usually the metal will take it. I'm going to buy some raw pipe and try cutting in new threads with these, for fun if nothing else.
0,works great for filling smaller bottles with dye
0,This is a very high quality set of resistors.  The color bands are well marked and the leads hold up to bending for breadboarding.  Although they are more expensive, I would buy other electronic parts from this supplier again
0,Good quality, holds weight with no issues. Better quality than what I got at hardware store.
0,All expectations were met or exceeded.
0,Great product
0,Excellent product!
0,Calibration seems to be dead on, repeatable measurements to 1/128 accuracy (may be higher, I was using the fractional settings).  Measurements were repeatable at all positions on the jaws (in other words if I used the tip of the jaws to measure, I got the same result when using the middle and maximum depths of the jaw opening - shows that the opening in the jaw is very parallel, so good quality).		Overall, seems very sturdy and quality.  Heavier than I thought and readings are displayed very fast.  Zero origin feature is nice		I wanted something for wood working, and this might be a little too precise for my needs.  Probably only need 1/64th readings, because that is about as accurate as I'd ever need to get on cutting wood.		If iGauging is reading this, would be a nice feature if you could select what fraction accuracy you would like to use (like have it automatically round 61/128 to something easier use - like have 64th inch accuracy (31/64) or even 32nd accuracy (15/32).  I realize this caliper is more for a machinist than a wood worker, but that would be a nice touch and this thing would be perfect!		I was considering sending it back because of the math that I have to do in my head (brain hurts) but after using it a few times, I love the accuracy, quality, and repeatability.  I might get a cheaper mechanical dial fractional caliper to supplement this for work only needing lower accuracy.
0,Exactly what I expected.
0,Great when it works.
0,as promised
0,This is another great product from 3M.... It works well for grinding or leveling on most materials.... If you are the average diy person or professional, this should meet your needs for most jobs. I highly recommend it.
0,Quality is good.  Easy to install on my RO system.
0,Pros:	-Really tough glue	-More flexible than super glue	-Waterproof	-Works on many surfaces, metals, wood, ceramics, some plastics, etc. Best for wood applications.		Cons:	-It expands, drips and produce tiny bubbles during the drying process. This is my biggest gripe. Definitely not for repairing your Lladros or others applications that require hairline precision.	-Glue is not clear but yellow. Very noticeable, not good if you really want a clean finish.	-Make sure you really clean the tip of the bottle or it will be hard to open and use it the next time	-Expensive
0,arrived on time, and as advertised
0,Great IR thermometer. Works as described. Feels very sturdy. Very good build quality.		Dual laser is helpful as well as ability to change emissivity. Great added value for few extra dollars comparing to cheaper models.		UPDATE: reducing the rating as it drains the battery even when not in use.
0,works as expected
0,excellent value, buy one if you need it
0,They are diodes.  I've used about 30 with no duds.  Now that Radio Shack is gone this is a quick and convenient deal.  These days you never know when you will need a diode to fix a power supply or control relay selection.  These are for low voltage.  Get the 1000 piv diodes for 120 volt work.
0,This has made applying wood glue on a model SO much easier.  I've probably used the same applicator with the same metal tip about 10 times now; since I'm just using wood glue I'm able to clean it out with hot water.  After cleaning it about half a dozen times the text has worn off but I don't measure how much glue I fill them with.
0,as described, very pleased !
0,A great product. I will definitely reorder this when needed.
0,Prints great, but it way more exciting expensive than it used to be, it should be cheaper. $36 is $14 more then their other colors and $10 more than it was not even a year ago.
0,fit my air tank just fine
0,High-quality product at a good price
0,good construction as I fill all the way to the top with water to mix saltwater for my aquarium. It's holding up well.

I think that helped in making this one easier to put together and setup because I already had an idea of what needed to be done.  With that said though, my first 3D printer never really worked right.  I got it 5 or 6 years ago, it was a low quality kit (it used printed plastic as "bearings"!), and I never really got a good print from it after fiddling with it for a long time.  It sat in storage for a lot of those years until about a 4 months ago when I decided to pull it out and start fiddling again ultimately leading to me throwing in the towel with it and buying this one.		The difference is quite amazing.  I've gone from only having a single semi successful print in 5 to 6 years of ownership on the old printer, to already printing 4 things successfully in a few days of ownership with this new one.  The quality of the parts is very nice.  The acrylic looks great, but be sure not to overtighten the screws or you could crack it.  I may upgrade the acrylic to aluminum at some point (I am buliding a CNC that will be capable of cutting aluminum as well hehe), but it's sturdy as is.  The instructions where mostly accurate, there were a few spots that were off a little but nothing to hard to figure out.  Overall it probably took me about 6 hours of total time working on it to get it assembled and then another 30 minutes to calibrate everything and get my first print.		A few issues to note:	-The plug that came with the unit is 110v but EU standard coloring.  It has no ground and no power switch which I was not crazy about.  So I went to lowes and got a grounded 3 plug extension cord, cut off the outlet end to wire it up to the printer power supply, and added a 110v 20amp switch as well to easily cut the power without having to unplug it every time.	-There is a design flaw on this model, as other reviews have stated the filament holder support blocks access to the SD card slot on the back of the LCD.  The company has a modified part to correct this and they sent me the STL file for it to make my own if I want.  You can also get around this if you use a micro sd card and sd card adapter.  There is enough room to remove the micro sd card from the adapter.	-The guide rail holes in the top pieces are slightly to small.  I had to use a drill to open them up a little until the rods would fit through.  Careful doing this though, do a little at a time, you don't want wobble in these rails.	-The heated bed warps a little when heated, it's thin aluminum, that is what happens.  Smaller prints in one area work fine as is, but anything larger you'll probably want to use a sheet of glass over the top of it.	-I do have a problem with filament leaking out the top of the heating block.  I've tried tightening it but haven't been able to get it to stop, although I'm wondering if it's partially due to the filament.  It didn't seem to happen for some white filament I have, but did for the little bit of orange that came with the printer.  HICTOP has already said they are sending me a new extruder tip, filament tube, and heating block to try and resolve it as well.	-The wires at  the control board are a mess!!  I'm going to be printing some kind of enclosure to house them soon lol.		All of these issues are overall fairly minor.  That is why I only deducted one star for them.		I also want to comment on the support.  I contacted them over a few issues, like a bad print on the turbine fan shroud, and a gouge mark on the heated bed.  After sending them a picture of it, they have sent me replacements.  I haven't actually gotten them in yet, but they are on the way.  The were really responsive with other questions I had and a great help.  Also, even though I believe they are based in China, their english is pretty good.  So I'm very happy with the level of support I have received thus far from HICTOP.		All in all if you are looking for a lower cost 3D printer that works well, I'd highly recommend this one.  I will update my review if anything changes, but with about 8 hours of printing on it so far everything is going well.
0,Great, I am able to get small amounts accurately calibrated on my scale.  Other cooks use it too.
0,Prints really well. Excellent.
0,Much harder than I expected.
0,Excellent wire brush
0,Airbrushed a helmet and used to glue the rubber trim back on. Works great!
0,perfect
0,The product description seems to be very thorough so it is difficult to try and add anything useful to it. This product is intended to help keep people safe by easily marking out danger spots and safe zones primarily indoors, without using paint and also being easier to remove if you have to.
0,Prints great right out of the box.  Printing using a Flashforge Dreamer with 200*C extrusion and 50*C bed.
0,Free machining aluminum stock for use in a Lathe.  Dimensions as listed.
0,Ordered this for my brother so he could snake his pipes. Worked like a charm. Only drawback is that it's a little too flexible for some spots, but it was easy enough to tape wire to it for more rigidity. Beats the hell out of a $200 fee for the plumber.
0,I haven't tried them yet but compared to other step bits I have they look to be made of quality material
0,This rod was easy to work.  I bought it for making wind flags and it drilled in two sizes, one for a rod and a smaller hole for a bearing, easily on the slowest setting of my drill press.  Drill slowly or the product might burn.  I'd give it five stars if each end of each piece was cut carefully - it wasn't so I ended up with 3-3" pieces and one almost 3" piece even accounting for the band saw blade cuts which were minimal.
0,This was a good deal, it seems like real wood (as real as I've seen from a 3D printer) but there is a big caveat you should realize when using this...make sure your nozzle is at least .5mm because I started to have jams at .4mm. I am not sure why .5mm is the magic number but I believe it has to do with possible chunks of wood in the PLA that causes it.		This is nice as it gives off an aromatic essence when you print with it. It definitely smells like wood and the texture of your prints feel and have some acoustic similarities. I'd recommend trying this if you get it for a good price and also if you have or plan to purchase a .5mm nozzle.
0,Have a work bench in basement on concrete floor.  Made a world of difference on feet.  I would rate this a buy again item.
0,As Described.......
0,these wheels are great.  My only problem is I really needed a wheel that locks and swivels. and you do not offer that the of wheel.
0,Works as advertised.
0,great for any mini fluid application, oil, flux, glue, paint
0,did what I needed them to do
0,inexpensive and good product.
0,I use this for protecting neighboring ICs when hot air desoldering.  Also useful for separating conductive points between two PCBs in close contact.  If I have a hard to reach passive that is moving while soldering, this keeps it in place.  Good price.  Good stuff.  Win.
0,OK, I have to give this 5 stars but it's not perfect.  But, the give and takes are a balance.  This is an 'Expert' material for a reason.  3D printing the softest rubber is an amazing feat on a consumer-level machine (I'm on a Taz 6 with the Flexystruder v2 head).  Any softer and you need to print molds and pour.		This material has to print slow and you have to design your print carefully.  You aren't going to get amazing detail with it, but it is quite cool and fun.  Doesn't smell much, and $45 for a spool of this is good value.  You might need a new head by the time you go through all this. ;')  My head's gears are already showing wear after a few dozen hours of printing.
0,Not much to say, they all mic out perfectly and are spherical. Metal. Duh.
0,Excellent quality

0,Great IR Receivers and transmitters
0,This set is a steal! I needed 4 of them, and this set was cheaper than a small pack of them locally. The job could wait, and so I got tons more, for a fraction the price in store. Connections have been working great for over a month with no issues. Great set!
0,While 24 oz sounds large, this is really the perfect size for taking lunches to work or even sending home leftovers with the holidays.  The beauty is that you don't really care if you get the container back,		I've bought some that have vent holes and I don't like that, these DO NOT have vent holes.		They are very sturdy and wash up well, though I have not put them in the dishwasher.  You can reheat food in the microwave with them, but I have not, I just keep a glass bowl at work and transfer my food.		My containers are not white, they are black.  It does not make a difference to me, but if you were wanting to send holiday treats or something, it could be an issue...
0,Very good gloves forgo e use. Satisfied and the pric. isveryeSvery good.
0,Great variety of resistors!
0,good addition to my 3 d printer
0,Worked great in MPSM I did most my printing at 205, and this stuff worked great. I have ordered other brands and so far Inland and Hatchbox have been pretty equally the best.
0,This stuff is good as far as I can tell, bought to use with Loctite 545 on AN aluminum to aluminum fuel fittings. The instructions say to use this to clean the joint and wipe off, I didn't wipe off well enough I guess, and it cured the loctite to a hard gel in about 10 seconds. It sealed ok I think, but make sure you clean it completely.
0,I checked out a sheet and it appears to be easy to use. I have yet to need a new sheet on my printer but expect this product to work well.

0,I bought these to help during a recent move...had many heavy and bulky objects to move to my vacation home, and this was just the thing I needed. With this sort of lifting sling, many tasks that would normally need two people can be safely handled by one.		Most of the time, it's not that objects are too heavy to lift - it's that they are too awkward to get a good grip. This is where the sling comes in...wrapped around a heavy object, you can use your body to advantage, putting enough leverage where it's needed to move surprisingly big items. Armed with one of these, I was able to move a large (350 pound) outdoor grill and a 500 pound gun safe single handedly, and without hurting myself.		Definitely recommended for anyone that might need to move a heavy or bulky item at some point.
0,This hands down is the EASY-est epoxy product I have found to use.  Its not too sticky or smelly, and seems to harden adequately.  I like the fact you can shape it into corners and things because its not sticky, almost like play dough.		I have used several other products, some more sticky, and some with more flow.  It does seem to me that those products seem to dry to a more rock hard state.  That said, I don't see repairs I did with these failing either.  It just does not dry as hard.		I used it for repairing rotted wood on items for which I could not find a replacement, like older french doors.  Also did some roof jambs.
0,nice but dont' buy this if you need a lot of air  it cant blow out what it can't suck in remember that''  if need something bigger buy this	VIVOSUN 4 Inch 203 CFM Duct Inline Fan with fan control.
0,decent quality but they wear out too quickly for me.  Maybe I'm just bearing down too hard but I wish they were a bit more sturdy.
0,The product and price are great and amazon prime saves me a trip to the store. Just two days latter it arrives, like having a personal assistance even for tooth paste!

0,I bought five spools of the ABS filament and I have had exceptional results. I use this on a RoBo 3D and on an Ultimaker 2. I use IC3D filament exclusively now. You can't go wrong with made in the USA.
0,This worked perfectly for me. Still, with shipping it cost more than to buy it locally.
0,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
0,Really a high quality DPDT switch.
0,It's hard to praise such a basic and pedestrian tool, however much it might deserve it. Real Pyrex, it should resist thermal shock. A wide base keeps it from tipping at slight touches. Markings are clear and easy to read. I expect many years of service from this graduated cylinder. Not the cheapest, but this isn't the kind of tool to skimp on.		-- wiredweird		PS: I have personal experience only of the 10ml and 100ml sizes, but Amazon might cross-post this review to others in the product line.
0,So far so good. Excellent product, clearly marked and they arrived fast. No complaints. Thank you! Will order again.
0,Great product, great price!
0,Very sticky. Just what a person needs when taping the spaces between sheets of insulation. When this roll runs out, will definitely be buying more.
0,They worked well.
0,I have been buying and using this stuff for years and for one reason only; it works! The price was very attractive and it arrived quickly too.
0,Smells a little weird but works nice.  It like a river smell  or something  like that.  So make sure you have a window open or something like that.
0,Use this on my carbonation equipment. Compact valve with smooth on/off action.
0,Perfect stand-offs.

0,Pretty copper bar that I bought for jewelry making. It suits my purposes and I will definitely order more from Small Parts when this is gone. Whatever your purpose, I can't imagine this not working for your purposes if you are looking for very sturdy, flat, unfinished copper. Once I figure out the best way to cut this, I'll be in great shape. I'm still experimenting with that, which is ok since the cost is so reasonable.
0,They're fine.  THANKS!
0,I'm giving this item four stars because it is repeatable but not accurate. When zeroed on a flat surface it reads 90 degrees off by .3 degrees in both directions. However, it is perfectly repeatable so as long as you calculate this you should be on point. I plan to use this on a homemade camber rig for my race car instead of spending $100+ on a commercial one.

0,Great buy and works great
0,Wow!!  This vacuum is amazing.  I had some neglected carpet to clean.  I wasted a lot of time trying to fix my old vacuum cleaner trying to buy parts for it.  Well I gave in and purchased a Bissell clean view upright.  All I know is it will pull ever inch of dirt from your carpet leaving nothing behind. It's strong and I like that it's not loud/noisy, it's easy to put together and take apart.
0,Really fantastic tape. I've had lots of students use it for projects. This is a fantastic alternative to wires in making projects in a classroom setting.
0,Nice wire brush
0,works good. nothing wrong. i am not using for very precise work, just cooking. it is 5 stars for me.
0,VERY BRIGHT WHITE with a tiny hint of translucency. Prints beautifully. Sienoc is a great brand so far and I'm going to try more of their colors soon.
0,PROS - variety, usage information & suggestions included	CONS - bulky storage box with wasted space, some types have too few samples		This special-purpose tape assortment reminds me of those bandage assortments that are useful to have on hand.  Lots of special purpose tapes that sit around unused, until the right situation occurs and then they are just the right thing to utilize.  Several of the types were unknown to me, yet now that I have them, I have immediate uses for them (see the full list in the product description above).		One thing that is good is that they include a card with usage suggestions.  For example, I didn't know what I might want the Foam Removable Tape for, and after seeing the suggestions I realized that I could use them as a quick and easy way to put artwork on the wall, as well as securing a kitchen rug that slips.		Search amazon for "tapecase tape kit" if you would like a different assortment, as there are numerous different sets available (or go to the tapecase website).		CONS:  The provided storage/organizing box looks nice at first, but I quickly realized that it is much larger than needed.  All the tapes themselves, if not spaced out nicely as they are in the box, would fit in a much smaller 5x5x2 inch box -- better for those with limited storage.  The actual box is 14.5x8.5x2.5 inches, and you can see from the photo above of the opened box how much empty space there is.  It would have been nice if they had included the possibility of adding more components, for example, I have some of their silicone tape, and I'd like to put it with the other tapes in the box, but it doesn't fit.		Also, and I know this is quibbling, I'd like a few more samples of some of the special purpose tapes.  There are only two of the Command Strips with Hooks, and I'd like a few more to mount right away.  Also, there are only three pairs each of the Hook & Look Fasteners, and the Dual Lock Clear Fasteners (which are sort of industrial strength rigid interlocking fasteners for much heavier items).  I think after investing in this assortment, it should last a bit longer before needing to refill the supplies.
0,bought 2,used on. works well,I love it's ability to be adjusted for direction( which can affect timing a little).good price.
0,Worked as designed and super price.
0,This is the best one I have found to test cables. Most have lights and they can be confusing to read. This has two rows of numbers, each number is one stand in the cable. You compare the top row to the bottom row. Easy. It also measures shorts and opens. Nicely done.
0,As described works very well with the monoprice mini.
0,works as intended, nice thick plastic but pretty expensive

0,Great product
0,I am using this as a temporary window solution for an historic restoration, where the principal windows will be out for some time. It is sufficiently clear to see the world outside and let sun in, and so far feels robust enough for the roughly 4ft x 4ft openings. I have made double windows (using strapping horizontally for the temporary frame) and I think it will work through a northeast winter.		Post-Winter-update: in fact the material ripped, as I had used staples to hold it and once the wind grabbed an edge under pretty extreme cold it, in a brittle state, ripped very easily. Lesson is to 'hide' all the edges so that no points of high stress or punctures from fasteners are exposed.
0,These appear to be real Pyrex.  Very happy.  Packed very well, delivery was fast.

0,I got two sets for a couple hoses and various tools. They work, I have had no issues with air leaks. They are pretty light and while sufficient for my light once a month use I could see them wearing out fast. You can definitely tell the difference between these and other 7 ball joiners.

0,Very nice filament.
0,I'm fine with these flaps. They're a step up from Freight-by-the-Bay and a step down from the Yellow Brand. Thinner abrasive layer, yes. Don't last as long as the ones that cost 10x, naturally. I use them to smooth and bevel edges of mild steel including weld slag removal. They wear out pretty fast if you try and remove mill scale. But even the expensive discs wear out fast doing that. I'll buy more.

0,I used this wood filament with standard PLA settings on my PRUSA i3 MK2, 205 extruder & 55 bed temp with somewhat poor results. The surface had a lot of smearing and indentations (see pic) whereas a standard PLA filament prints just fine. My guess is that the nozzle temp is way too high and it's way too soft, and I've read other reviews where they were printing in the 180's and it worked fine. (It is a softer material than PLA - noticable when you flex/bend it by hand).		So net-net it looks like wood and probably prints just fine once you get the temperatures dialed-in correctly.
0,The glue works fine on foam RC planes, but the bottle was only half full.
0,Some of the best solid-colored PETg available in for printing.
0,Worked good for what I needed . Didnt break down at all during heavy use

0,The clip can be a little awkward to open sometimes, the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Being able to chain them together can be useful. Useful for keeping batteries organized in your bag instead of rolling around loose. I use my batteries in pairs and fours. Tip : to quickly see if a pair of batteries is fresh or depleted, I put them in the case with the tops of the pair facing the same direction to indicate fresh, and in opposite directions (one up, one down) to indicate they're used (for recharging, or for proper disposal).
0,Works
0,These bits seem to work well and hold an edge well.
0,Arrived in perfect condition. Will need a little cleaning before putting in service in the lab, but i expected that. A good quality lab cleanser will suffice. These are not super thick bud adequate for crystallization and beaker covers, and at this price so what if you break a few once in awhile? They are plenty strong enough. Mine were packaged with paper between each glass, and paper overall around the packet, then in a cardboard box snug enough to keep them from rattling, then in another box for shipping. Will buy again.
0,Mounted easily, very durable and the metal allows magnet to be used.  Very versatile product.

0,Nice little kit for putting grommets on almost anything made of fabric, leather, etc.	It would have been nice to have had a variety of sizes, but the hole punch and platform would need to be separate units for each grommet size.
0,I upgraded my Laser Cutter to a larger more powerful Tube and power supply and in the process needed to attach a water chiller unit to the laser system.  This tubing works well for all the interconnects between the tube and chiller.
0,Great product that holds a lot better than butt connectors.
0,hello,	  this tape is outstanding for working as a self fusing material.  it is wrapped in a separate clear plastic film to keep the tape from "fusing" together. for wrapping the ends of rope, it can wrap onto itself to create a tight bond.  around metal tubing for a gasket to keep thing from scratching the finish, it works great.  it is not for large permanent holes or leaks in pressure hoses, e.g. washer, car radiator, heater, etc.  it works well as a temporary stop for small leaks.  this product is very handy for all kinds of tape use.  in some cases, much better than the standard electrical tape for common repairs.  it does not stick directly to a surface like the electrical tape, but it fuses to the surface of itself when wrapped around something.  it is a short roll, but it works well and lasts for many different jobs.  to be color coordinated, you can get black, red and clear.  we wrapped a pair of crutches with this clear wrap to keep the crutches from sliding away from any cabinet or counter top when at rest.  a great product for many uses.
0,Very good product. I'm using for pistol grips and it's fantastic...
0,These shears are for use in an IFAK or any other first aid kit.  They are very sturdy and will even cut thin wire.  Also, they are easy to clean or sterilise.
0,Perfect transaction and product as promised.
0,I think all of the joke reviews have distracted from the actual value of this product.		For example, you can use small quantities your teenager's shoes to detect when they try to sneak out at night.  Just put a detector by the doors and windows and an audible beeper in your bedroom.  End of problem!		You can finally put an end to the neighbor's pesky dog pooping in your yard.		If stopped for speeding, you can immediately show the officer this can and tell him you HAVE to get it to the lab before it reaches critical mass.  It's unlikely he will know that can't happen and if he questions it as fake a simple Geiger Counter test will convince him quickly... and you'll be on your way.		It makes an excellent birth-control device.  Just keep a bit in your pocket.  Don't believe all the claims about mutants.  That almost never happens.		There are many more actual, valid uses for this product, so let's set aside the humor and see some serious reviews!  Earnest customers want actual information based on experience!
0,This is a high quality hone that will last for several applications if taken care of.		Don't forget to buy a nylon brush to finish the job with a good cleaning.
0,Outstanding product for connecting multiple electrical wires, especially when there are three or more.

No problem though-I am going to give it to my daughter- because I don't think I'll need another one soon.

0,The electrode gel does improve the e-stim contact providing more effective muscle stimulation and massage. It also restores the "stickiness" of the electrode. It will extend the life of the larger and much more expensive electrodes that I bought to use on the quadriceps and hamstring. Being able to re-use electrodes instead of replacing is a tremendous value proposition and made this purchase very worthwhile.

0,This ZING video surveillance sign is a good size, is easily visible even in lower light conditions due to the strong contrasting colors (is not a reflective material, tho) and is made of a sturdy and lightweight metal that feels like it will last. The writing appears to be printed on in a lightly glossy paint, and seems well-made with no obvious chipping or distress. There are holes punched in each of the four corners, that will accommodate typical screws. The sign is not alarming, and is a good notification that should hopefully be obvious from a distance, w the graphic of a box-type CCTV type camera prominent, so that your property will be deemed to be too much trouble by bad guys scoping out the area. I'd recommend this sign whether or not you have actual video surveillance equipment running, but with camera set-ups being so relatively inexpensive lately, it makes sense to secure your family and property.
0,Decent scope.	As many will know, this is a SOFTWARE downgraded version of the 100 Mhz scope.	There are several software utilities Rigol attempts to sell to improve the scope. Research them before buying.		What isn't mentioned in many reviews is that vertical translation of waveform(s) is exceptionally slow/sluggish.	Moving them up or down is noticeably slow and unresponsive. This is not typical for higher quality scopes.
0,Just what I needed for those hard to reach places on my guns.
0,Well-made product for a fair price.  Can't go wrong with these.
0,Work well.
0,Need instructions to fine tune the slide action.  Very heavy duty and did the job I intended it for.  Could not orient the vise to drill adequately.  But not sure if it was my drill press, the vise of me that could not get the right position.
0,We printed the horse cell phone stand off thingiverse with Hatchbox Wood 3D PLA as a first try, and just like all other Hatchbox filaments we had perfect success the first time!  We are printing with the FlashForge Creator Pro and at a temp of 220C with a platform temp of 50C.  We used a raft and breakaway support settings using the same material as the horse (wood) and had no problems. Replicator G software was used to make the x3g file for printing.		The material comes out a little more liquid like than normal PLA but this did not affect the print.  And it definitely has the aroma of wood when printing!
0,Hopefully I won't need this but I have it just in case.
0,These binders are very nice and well worth the money for any hobbyist or someone getting into surface mount technology (prototyping or rework). Thanks!
0,I've been cleaning my glasses with these for years. Really nice.
0,Exactly what I needed! Product is high quality and all the dimensions are dead on and  machines beautifully!
0,Love this stuff. Foams up and bonds really well. Been using it for the longest time and never had anything fell apart. But it can get messy. It hard to judge how much to use.
0,The carbide rotary set arrived right on schedule and was as described on line. The set appears as good quality stored in a plastic hard case. The varied tips is useful for larger craft applications- the working tips are about 0.25 inches with 0.125 shafts - except for the tapered heads - perfect for my Dremel tools.
0,Works great.
0,Much more accurate than litmus papers. Perfect for monitoring pH in your garden and house plants.
0,A good quality Gaffer's tape for a reasonable price.  What else is there to say?  I have used Gaffer's tape for years for everything from live-event cable tack-down to semi-permanent "duct tape" style applications.  Always comes off clean and easy while somehow not letting go pre-maturely.  It's actually some neat stuff.

0,This filament seems to print quite nicely. The transparency of your finished product really depends on how many shells you use and the infill. If you want a really transparent part it's best to use a low number of shells and no infill, a vase with only one or two shells would probably look great. The photo shows the color vs Hatchbox white for reference.	Overall I really like the 'transparent' filaments because they have a cool sheen to them. Almost like they were acetone polished without actually being polished.
0,Just what we needed.
0,Great
0,Exactly as advertised.
0,Perfect, very accurate and does the job well. Is temperature accurate which is a pretty big deal to get correct readings.
0,I use this on my Makerbot Replicator 2X. I cannot recommend this enough, really good filament. Work at 200 C, No issues at all.
0,It MIGHT be enough if all you want to do is take off a little bit and there are not hard large stones in the concrete mix, but I would think of this as a finishing tool, not a concrete leveling tool when you have to remove perhaps more than 1/4" to level adjacent areas, or as I am trying to do, put in a swale for drainage on concrete tilting the wrong way for proper drainage.		Bottom line for me: This is OK for fine smoothing of an area, but not enough bite to cut down through the stones in the concrete unless you want to spend hours grinding. I now bought a diamond blade for the heavy removal and will use this for smoothing up the job after the major removal is done.
0,Control was installed on an outside LED light fixture that didn't have a "dusk to dawn" capability as purchased.  The installation was easy with a 5/8" Dia. hole saw to cut a hole into the light fixture and the use of "wiring nuts" to connect the control wiring per the diagram on the control packaging.  Once installed, the control functioned correctly to turn on the light on at low light levels and to turn the light off at higher light levels.  It required a change in directional position to keep the control from cycling off the light with the turning on of the light at dusk. Once this position direction was changed, the light functioned as desired.	  The plastic casing and plastic  threads may have a long term life problem in the outside sun/climate conditions.
0,works like its suppose to, and I haven't had the need to use the second battery yet.		Like everyone says don't drop it especially on cement that goes for most things you buy.	I dropped it but luckily it hit my foot first the back jaws hit the cement and locked it shut.	I fixed that problem and it works just like i bought it.		I gave it five stars because it works like intended no problems.	if it messed up when i dropped it that's my problem and not the products, but nothing that couldn't be fixed happened.		* It remembers where it was as when you turn it off.	* it automatically turns on when you move the slider. (i kinda like that feature. i lock it in place when i turn it off though)	* It keeps zero very well. some times i get dust in between the jaws and it reads wrong but that's not the products fault. easily fixed		That is all i can think of to say at the moment..
0,This sprays really nice. Now hopefully it will last a long time but only time will tell.
0,These clips were perfect for making temporary connections while setting up a wiring schematic for reverse lighting. They are heavy duty enough for any hobbyist and long enough for most experiments.  My single disappointment is that they do not come in a broader variety of colors.
0,Accurate and precise.
0,great product
0,Purchased as a scale verification weight, and it seems very accurate when I've compared it to other known weights.
0,I like these screws and for the price if you don't does it really matter?  They are strong , silver and go into wood easily
0,NONE AT THIS TIME.
0,I use this silicone to make self-sealing injection ports on different kinds of lids for mushroom growing. Works great, goes through the autoclave without trouble. Good price too. Have already bought twice, you can bet I'll order this again!

0,This wheel is of better quality than the original! Removal of the old (bent) wheel and installation of this wheel on my wheelbarrow took less than ten minutes, a perfect fit. It was even equipped with a zerk fitting and the original was not.
0,peerfect for me
0,Came as expected. Will buy more
0,About 20 years ago I bought a Rubbermaid Heavy Hauler made from the same materials as this cart.  I still use the hauler outside almost every day and have only had to replace the wheels once in 20 years.  No other maintenance required.		This cart serves several purposes for me. First off is as a way to get our groceries from the car to the kitchen. It has high sides to hold in those plastic bags full of groceries, is easy to push/pull with the supplied wheels, and is light and easy to steer in tight places.  I also use it when I'm moving heavier items in the house (boxes of books, ammunition, cases of water, etc.) because it quintuples the weight of items that I can move in one trip.  And I use it outside as a work platform to move pots, soil and fertilizer, chemicals, tools, and buckets of water for my new plantings.		The cart fit together perfectly with tight tolerances, had the correct bolts, washers and nuts, and was easy to assemble.  After about 30 minutes with two types of screwdrivers and a socket wrench, the cart was put together and ready to roll.  Great rolling cart that can save you a lot of time and effort--especially if you have a bad back.  Highly recommend.
0,A great selection and quantity for a great price!
0,I was worried about this filament because it was not properly vacuum sealed, i.e. the bag was loose and had air in it. I also ordered a gray filament from the same manufacturer and it was packaged properly. So far though I have printed a few things with this and it doesn't seem to have suffered any ill effects from the air exposure.
0,As advertised, works great
0,Have for when Needed for camping !
0,Well they work great, if I was to mention any fault it would be that you receive a large amount of larger diameter tubing more so it seems than the smaller diameter, now I don't know about you but I don't deal very much with 1/2" diameter wire.	Other than that the price is good and quality is very good.	I would buy again!	Hope my review was "Helpful to you, let me know if you have any questions.	Thanks..
0,We ordered a couple (one for practice and one for the first aid kit)... and keep finding uses for the practice one around the house. Excellent for the money and hope it's never really needed.
0,Best stuff ever
0,works as expected
0,This PLA Filament is great, melts around 205 to 210 degree. Wonderful color compared to other PLA filaments that I have bought online, it comes with a filament clip which is a big plus. Really Nice and I will purchase another color soon.
0,Excellent!
0,Does the job. Good price.
0,This will Hold any thing....One Thing, Let it Dry for 24 Hours, and Your Good to Go!!!!	TWO THUMBS-UP!
0,just what u need
0,great item at a great price
0,Really like this thing.  The app is alright.  Takes very clear images, considering the price.  Having to charge it is a bit of a pain, but is tenable.  Mostly use it around the house and for the odd project here and there (heatflow in computer cases, finding outlets that should be re-wired...that kind of thing).
0,Nice assortment, ample adhesive inside tube, grips wire well, when heated and shrunk, would buy again,
0,Seems pretty good.  I thought these might last longer than the ones I normally use because they have more sanding flaps.  Time will tell and I'll update my review.  I haven't gotten to use them much yet.  For the price, I can't complain if they last longer or not.
0,Does it's job well.  Chips are out of the socket.
0,Thank you.
0,Printed one roll.  Diameter was about 1.70-1.72  a bit small but it worked. I increased the feed a bit to compensate for the smaller diameter.
0,Really smooth action and a nicely made precision instrument. All movements are just so smooth, it is worth the money.
0,So far so good.  I have printed several items using this PLA.  I have no complaints at this point.  I have only used about half the spool.  The color comes out great and normal PLA settings for all my other PLA has worked with this as well.  210 hot end, and 60 on the bed.
0,This filament prints very smoothly and has very even diameter throughout. I had heard good things about Hatchbox filament and they definitely hold true here. This is probably the best filament I've used yet and I'm sure I'll be buying more in the future.
0,Great! Thanks!
0,I give these away when customers purchase vials from me. The quality of the plastic is better than others i've purchased.
0,Husband liked them for what he wanted them for
0,great
0,One of the best cutting Fluids in the Industry. Not too thin and not too thick.	Very dark in color and has some odor to it. It's much better then Tap Magic .	But hey don't take my word for it. Try it yourself.
0,These are great quality valves.  Easy to install and align properly.  No leaks at all.
0,seem to be ok. case is kinda hard.  but seem to work
0,Nice price
0,this is a good item gave it 5 starts , it works well i would buy this again as needed
0,Excellent product. This simple device (gage) turned me from a rookie into a pro at making angled joints! Get this tool! Don't wait... it's worth every penny. Just wish it had an on/off button though to save battery life...
0,Grabbed this as I was looking for something close to "TARDIS" blue. A bit light for that but pretty darn close.	Prints well on our Robo 3D R1+.	Sorry for the potato quality on the image, I really should stop using my dinky phone to take pictures.		Edit: Added better photo. Nearly out of this spool and intending to buy another.
0,Worked great for my application. Pretty decent quality for China made. Would buy again!
0,I depend on it to measure the fermentation
0,These worked great for my project at home.  Did not have any issues with striping the clamp out.  Will purchase again.
0,This is a excellent meter...I have owned a B&K LCR meter for years that cost MUCH more..This meter will do anything it does and just as well..
0,This is the best stuff out there. Zero problems. I print daily for products I sell. I am not a schill for the brand. shadow quad dot com. check it out. White is the very easy to work with.
0,Exactly what I wanted.
0,Tape is very sticky -- BUT not as "super OMG" sticky as some would have you believe ...
0,Love Gorilla products, hate the prices.
0,Do the job. Don't rip. Fit well.
0,Item delivered on time, was as described,
0,Lost my tool and picked this one up. Usually really stiff at first. I just work it back and forth until it loosens up. Doesn't what it's supposed to do.
0,Gets heavy things easily to where I want them and then folds up and is easy to store away.
0,Great price
0,What I was looking for works great.
0,How do you go wrong with these.  I mean really?  put a hole in the bulb, well these work great.
0,Laus Deo :-)
0,Excellent and the best price I could find when shipping is factored in, even from local bog box stores.
0,Mine had a small burr on the inside from the tapping of the threads. Other than that, it's perfect.
0,I used this on some serious under windshield cowl rust. Used with a Scotch Brite pad on the worst stuff, and just paint-brushed on the rest, the rust was gone the next day. Rinsed with water and used Rust Bullet the next day
0,These are my favorite test probes. I have used them for years at work and am glad to have a pair for home use. The sharp points are handy for probing surface mount components and other small areas. I also appreciate the thin but durable leads. Other test leads may be equally durable but are bulkier and not as compliant. My favorite tips are the pogo (spring loaded) pins but the others are handy for accessing some parts. I have heard one engineer who does not like these probes. I think he did not like the delicate tips and difficulty using these with mini-Grabbers.
0,work Great, fast shipper.
0,Our shop has the Brown & Sharp version of this and this works just as well at a fraction of the price
0,Good
0,main feature I like is,  NONE OF THESE ARE METRIC.  There is nothing wrong with metric, but if you are boring a hole to tap for these on a product, you are not going to find metric hand taps just anywhere.
0,I posted a question and got two excellent reply's. Thanks. The question was-- how come air is sucked in at the top of the handle? duh, it's because the handle has to be pulled down to switch the two ports. My wife had no problem but when I was playing with it in an upright position the wrong port was used. It's automatic. Clever it is. .  This unit is full of bear traps for some people.  If you are good at puzzles good for you. If not, it's not for you.		 Consumer Reports  down rates it for poor suction. I agree. I measured a bit over 6 amps with is about 720 watts. A high power vac pulls about 12 amps . That is 1400 watts.  Their Vac motor, I think , is made  by Panasonic. Some  Hoovers pull 1400 watts. They copied Dyson and lost big time in the patent courts .  Dyson  got paid millions. Copy cats.  Now another Asian company is in the same boat. . For the money they charge it is  a bit much .Watch  out for  those who claim cyclonic action. Only Dyson has a true cyclone and good for him.	 I  just bought it as  a Christmas present for the Wife.  On Sale for $300.00. She likes it because it's light weight. The hose for our 12 amp central vac  is hard to move around. " She likes it but doesn't like the price.	I wish Dyson would quit advertising "  NEVER LOOSES SUCTION."  It's hard to loose something you never had.
0,When I did my first 5 gallon batch, I knew I was going to need one of these. It also includes more than enough hose and fittings to get you started with either a system that puts the water back into the ground, or a recirculating system with an insulated container (I just empty the spent grain out of my water-cooler mash tun) with ice packs or frozen water bottles. Since my ice pack supply was limited, I mostly had to rely upon draining the water, and during the late spring, I had my brew cooled down in less than 30 minutes. After an already long brew day, this kept it from going on into the night.
0,I use this to hold down boards to the waste board on my CNC mill so I don't have to deal with awkward clamping setups.  This stuff works really well for that application - just stick a few strips of it on the bottom of the board to cut, peel off the backing, and press it on the waste board.  Keeps things secure enough for milling, and still comes off again with no residue afterward.  It does leave some gum on the milling bits (as expected), but that comes off with some acetone no problem.
0,Why buy wire connectors one at a time as you need them when you can buy this set and have enough wire connectors to re-wire an entire vehicle or boat?  These connectors are sorted by wire size, and super easy to use.  Just strip the wire you want to put the connector on, slip it into the connector, lightly crimp the connector, then use a heat source to contract the heat shrink part of the connector to make it watertight.  This creates far more secure connections than what you could achieve with electrical tape alone and is far easier to do than solder and heat shrink tubing.		The connectors come sorted in a sturdy plastic case that is about the size of a box of crackers.  I received a discount on my purchase of this in exchange for agreeing to test the connectors out and post my honest review.  These are great and I would gladly buy them again but with this many connectors I am unlikely to need to buy any more for a very long time.		Note: these are only for use on 12v systems.  Do not try to use these to make connections involving 110/120v household current.
0,Just got this first spool of Inland filament, and it has printed very well so far.  The shipment arrived earlier than expected.  I'm not a big fan of pink, but I wanted to print something and this is the color I needed to use.  This color is exactly what you think of when "PINK" is mentioned.  Very pliable filament, which usually means it's fresh and dry.  I've read of this brand having spool tangles, but I've bought expensive and inexpensive filament and they can all have tangles.  My extruder feeds this very well.  I have been using an indicated temp of 210 for the hot-end and 50-60 for the heated bed. This causes the printed object to have a glossy finish.  Not all filaments will do this, though.  If this continues to print like it has so far, I'll buy more from this seller, only in different colors.
0,love this product.
0,little sticky, but works well
0,I needed syringes for filling bottles and these are perfect. Good quality and measuring marks, would buy again.
0,I love this stuff for use in the marine environment.  It's fast drying, waterproof and long lasting.  For most applications, it doesn't' take much and that's a good thing because it's fairly expensive.
0,Product was as advertised, quality seems good.
0,good stuff

0,As advertised ...great product
0,Seems to work, double checking cellar dehumidifier how accurate it is, so far very good.
0,This particular style of grabber is meant to be used with more delicate jobs like changing light bulbs, Sachets, envelopes, books and Tablets or smart phones.  I was requested by VIVE to test their product and then leave an objective, impartial review.  They must really believe in their product to do that as I could really slam this product if it failed my testing.		Anyway, i proceeded to test it.  This is what I found:		1.  I find that this is really the best at picking up keys, remote controls, watches etc.  But it is the best at picking up golf balls. Just to give you an idea, this is similar to you pinching something with your fingertips.  All the force is concentrated on the small area of the suction cups.		2.  It has more feel than the other styles of grabbers.		3.  The trigger is very easy to squeeze.		SUMMARY:	It was really functional.  I could not use it to grab a drinking glass.  The Rotating Reacher is more appropriate for that task.
0,Thanks nice job
0,Best tape ever!  I've used this for quite a few years now.  Homemade bandages, especially fingers, dog ear wounds which are nearly impossible to get anything to adhere to, also dog leg wounds.  Very flexible and elastic product with great adhesion and water resistance.
0,It was nice to be offered this to keep on hand here at home.  Though it is mostly used in the professional setting, I was able to use this on my servers and computers here at home.  It is truly lint free and cleans up fast and efficient with one swipe.  Great to use with more sensitive and equipment.  It can be a bit pricey for personal use, but in the professional setting, it is worth using on your expensive equipment.
0,Great price, and 100% worked correctly! Resistance in bright artificial light were all around 1.5K, and varying darkness over 20k. I suspect way over 20k, but it wasn't convenient to make it real dark.
0,I have been shooting these nails in my Porter Cable Bammer for a few years now and I haven't had any problems.  Though I don't use my tools for a living, I am an avid woodworker and home renovator. As such I would say that in the past 5 years I have shot a thousand or so of these nails through my P-C Bammer gun and I can count the times it misfired on one hand. As long as the gun is set properly you should have no problems with jamming or with setting these nails below the surface of the wood.		With the good experience I have had, I can easily recommend these as a good buy!
0,Its a lot of money for a small piece of glass...but its worth the investment in your 3d printer.  Its really a pain when normal glass breaks due to thermal stress...on your 3rd print.  This just works print after print.  It is exactly the right size for the typical MK2 heated bed.  I am not printing directly on the glass.  I'm printing to a sheet of Polyetherimide affixed to my glass via the 3m 468MP CaseTape.  I took good care and cleaned the glass well, then ensured I put the tape in neat rows.  Removed the backing and laid down the PEI sheet.  PLA sticks to PEI as if it were superglued when 75C, and just pops off at room temp.  The glass is so flat, and won't thermal shock on me.  I feel this is a quality bed setup good for thousands and thousands of prints.  So, if you are thinking of using a mirror or just plain hardware store glass because borosilicate is pricy, you may actually save yourself a lot of headache with the borosilicate glass as it won't thermal shock.
0,Just wish I had a small fridge to store it in to extend it's shelf life.
0,All good. Very pleased...
0,Use this on all sorts of stuff. Works like it should.
0,Excellent PLA, prints like a dream on both my duplicator i3 and CR-10. I have not observed any issues what so ever, very consistent diameter and flows well.  I have used 6 or 8 different colors of their PLA and all have been just as great!!!!! Love the solutech stickers with each roll too, habe seen several different ones in all my various rolls. Can't wait to see them release other types of filament.
0,top rim of cylinder has some imperfections, still works fine
0,great!!!!!!
0,Very nice selection of extremely TINY capacitors.  Even the 100nf caps are tiny!  I printed up labels and organized them in steps, such as 1pf - 9.9pf, 10pf - 99 pf, etc using index cards, and placed them in order in their little plastic labeled bags between the index cards in an index card file box.  Getting the parts out of the little bags can be a hassle, but nothing like trying to find the right value using a magnifying glass in a clump of many values!
0,Not see through like glass... see through like milk jug
0,Perfect fitting to eliminate the prone to leak quick disconnect fuel fittings in my boat
0,I used these to cover the heating vebts and they worked a treat!
0,This idea is fantastic,  small amounts of different types of tape as a go to kit when you need to solve a problem.  The cost is a concern but these specialty tapes are costly (for example the glow tape is 74 bucks for 5 yards, which works out to five dollars a foot and the 3M Wire Management Tapes SJ3000 is about a dollar a foot).  You are still paying more per foot for these, but you do get a wide assortment to choose from in order to solve your problem.  You can test them out to see what works. There are several different kits available.		My biggest issue is with the storage space.  Space is very tight in dorm rooms and this box has a lot of wasted empty space in it, along with not very great instructions.  The materials could be stored in something one third the size and should be labeled in some way that stays with the product (maybe in small plastic bags) if they are removable.  Dorms get touchy about you damaging the wall surfaces.		So I think this is a excellent idea, it just needs some refinement.
0,just got this today and cant wait to use it , It looks fine and was larger then I was thinking it would be so FYI if your getting rubber plugs to go with this you will need a size 7 or 8 .....I don't have one but the size 6 I did get will just fall right in
0,We are craft jewelers and use this to make some of our products. It is great quality and easy to work.
0,works great cuts the grease
0,I have been looking into purchasing one of these vacuums for a few years now. Now that i have finally took the plunge i don't know why i waited so long. This unit cost about $80 more than my upright vacuum but it takes off a huge workload from my everyday routine. This unit has good suction and keeps the floor tidy from the cat hair and whatever else my daughter drops throughout the day.		The vacuum makes tight turns and gets right next to the wall. Cleanout is fast and simple. Return to home option works well.		I absolutely love this product and would recommend to anyone.
0,This product was just what I needed to remove a stubborn clog from my toilet.  I had previously tried a plunger and a lightweight snake to do so, but they were ineffective.  Within a minute using this toilet auger I removed the clog and avoided the cost of having to call a plumber to do the job. An excellent tool for anyone with a similar problem and well worth the price.
0,These hinges worked well with the desk that I built for my grandkids. I made them to fold flat against a wall when not in use. These hinges were not available locally.
0,Don't last as long as name brands but for the price I think at the end still better??		*******update*********		I was thinking id bought 40 grit	These are 80 grit and do awesome for 80 grit!		Will buy again!
0,Good quality chain and haven't had any quality issues with it.
0,I find this a better, more useful general-purpose lubricant than WD-40.
0,Works great. I like that it stores the lowest and highest humidty and temps
0,Nice assortment of sizes and colors. They shrink in diameter as well as any other brand that I have used (50-60%); don't shrink noticeably lengthwise and seem reasonably resistant to heat.		In a couple of overzealous moment I applied too much heat; the heat shrink was fine but the insulation on the wire I was covering charred slightly.
0,Bought for replacement.
0,Worked great
0,I've used these beakers in the oven, over a hot plate, carried out extremely hot exothermic reactions, and even ignited a small smoke bomb in the 50ml beaker and had no problems with any of my beakers. Very good for the home chemist.
0,As accurate as calipers can be. Great deal.
0,Excellent.
0,If you've walked down the oral hygiene aisle in the store lately, you've probably noticed that there's pretty much no such thing as a standard tube of toothpaste any more.  "Whitening" is the new standard toothpaste.  All you have to do to see why is to watch an 80's or earlier movie and pay attention to everyone's "realistically yellow" teeth.  Back then, you didn't really notice it.  But now...yuck!		This toothpaste is blue, tastes minty, and has little square "mini breath strips" init.  The cap on the tube is one of those little flip-type caps which can also screw on and off.  Every time I have a tube with that style cap, the cap breaks at the joint.  The larger flip-type cap on the end of my old tube let me stand the toothpaste tube up on its end.  But on the bright side, I guess this tube's cap uses less plastic and it will be easier to squeeze out every last bit of toothpaste out of it than with my old stand-up tube.
0,Item works as expected and delivered on-time.
0,Exactly as advertised
0,Cut great i use them in plastic fabrication, with my Milwaukee M12 die-grinder. would defiantly buy again.
0,The only gripe I have is that it got hung up in the bottom of the cylinders and at one point it pulled one of the nylon bristles (with the balls on them), partway out, so that it was longer than the rest. I had to cut it off.	Perhaps there is nothing to be done about this, but it was constantly getting hung-up in holes and crevices at the base of the cylinder.
0,Excellent quality gloves at a reasonable price.  I have used these gloves woke working on plumbing at my hone.  They were fairly surname and only ripped after repeated friction on a metal pipe snake.  The gloves are comfortable and fit well and did not leave any odor or residue the way that latex gloves do.
0,used to remove metal rust

0,First and foremost: I hate vacuuming.  We have hardwood and tile floors and I sweep them every day.  We have indoor cats that shed and cleaning is a constant event, so I decided to try this vacuum cleaner, mostly for the attachments.		I put the vacuum cleaner together by following the instructions.  I have to admit that some of the parts are made of plastic and I was  concerned that some of the pieces might break off as I was snapping them into place.  None did.  I put the whole thing together in about 30 minutes, and believe me, I am slow at putting things together because I am just not good at it.		The Eureka As1095A Professional Bagless Upright vacuum cleaner is white and lightweight.  The waste compartment, cord rewind compartment, and roller bar at the bottom of the vacuum are all in clear and visible compartments.  After the vacuum cleaner is assembled, you have several attachment options that all together make this a multi-tasking unit.		The cord appears to be long enough to vacuum any room in our house, and we have large rooms.  I say appears to be, because I never pulled the cord all the way out of its storage container.  I never had to.  I had plenty of cord.  There is also a handy cord retracting system that pulls the cord back inside the storage compartment, with the press of a button.  Nice.		Before starting any job with this unit, you have to choose from settings for high carpet, bare floor, and low carpet.  If you are using attachments instead of the bottom rotary device, you have to switch suctioning by way of a slider device, to choose between tools and floors.  That obviously directs the air flow to the right area.		This unit comes with several attachments, including a telescope wand, a stair & upholstery turbo brush, a regular brush, and a regular vacuum wand.  They all attach easily into a spiral hose that is hand held.  I used all of the attachments and got good suction and results from all.  I used the telescope wand the most, to get to the tops of doors & windows, hard to reach corners, behind the desk and piano, etc.  I got cat hair, some cat food, paper wrappers, spider webs, and a few live spiders.  (Sorry).		The vacuum cleaner unit glided easily behind me as I worked with the hand held attachments.  The waste holding compartment is nice because its clear and you can  see what you vacuum up.  It's easy to empty, just click out the entire front of the unit, take it outside to the trash,  slightly pull up on the clear lever to release the top on the waste compartment, then empty out the contents.		If you are looking for a lightweight vacuum cleaner with several hand held attachments, this will probably work for you.  It's a good unit.  As far as the professional claim in the name, I'm not sure.  I would recommend it for household use.		It's easy to put together, has a strong sounding motor, and sucks up anything you need sucked up, and perhaps some things you don't want sucked up - but you can remove them from the container if you need to .  That's a plus, too.		It looks good and doesn't take up much space when its not in use.		I like this vacuum cleaner mostly for the attachments and strong motor.  I can recommend it to anyone in the market for a vacuum cleaner.
0,I have the same version at home, bought one for travel. I like this unit much more than the other brands.

0,good product
0,Great product when the surfaces are properly prepared (i.e clean and sometimes scuffed up to give the surface some tooth) and the epoxy is properly mixed.  I prefer the quick set for most repair work and it has proven sufficiently strong.  The syringe makes measuring a snap vs the two-bottle style but it doesn't last as long on the shelf once open.  My personal policy is that if I can't remember when I last used it, toss it and get a new one.
0,I was very skeptical at first about the quality of this expensive tape.  After exposing it to the harsh monsoon of 2013, which still hasn't ended, I am very pleased with both the silver and red rolls.		Preparation is 90% of any job.		If you clean the smooth metal surface thoroughly with 91% Isopropyl Alcohol, this tape WILL stick...and it will stay...and is visible a mile away...that's all I have to say, except, if I needed it, I buy more today.
0,This PLA produces very nice, consistent prints.  The color is a bit different than I had expected, but the print quality and bed adhesion are excellent.  Best way I can describe the color is "Barney Purple" (the dinosaur).  I was expecting more of a dark, royal purple but I wouldn't consider this an issue with the product.  Below are the settings I use:		Printer: Tinkerines Ditto+	Nozzle Temp: 210C	Speed: 55mm/s	Bed: Not heated.  Use blue painters tape		The only issue I noticed is that the product description states that the spool hub hole diameter is 1.50".  IT IS NOT!  The spool hole diameter is 1.25".  It doesn't quite fit over the spool holder on the back of my Ditto+ but I keep my printer up against a wall, which holds the spool in place nicely, so really a non-issue.  It may, however, be an issue depending on which printer you are using.
0,Beautiful Stethoscope!  The sound through the ear piece is very clear, clearer than my Littmann.  I am not currently sold on the ear piece plastic as it is a harder plastic (not hard, just harder, not as soft) than my previous stethoscope and I tend to have sensitive ears; I will have to see if the smaller ear pieces that came with it fit better.  The 'scope is weightier than my previous one, but not an uncomfortable weight; It feels substantial.  I have yet to wear it over a 12hr shift so I'm not sure if it will get uncomfortable as time goes by.  The name tag is a nice bonus to help keep your 'scope from growing legs and wandering off.  I am very happy with the lifetime parts program; I hope to not have to use it anytime soon, but to have the option without buying a new "scope is awesome!
0,This is very sticky, works wonderfully with my tens pads. Remember a little bit goes a long way, so this will last for a long time.
0,The product is well made but don't expect super accuracy from any brand of these kind of probes, it will not tell you that your bedroom is 75 Deg or that your freezer is at -12 deg.  These type K probes don't have that kind of accuracy; you will see a few degrees difference +/- from the correct reading.  The reason for that is that they work over a wide range of temperatures; you can go from reading the tip of your soldering iron all the way down to reading some super frozen spray liquid, the price you pay for that wide temperature range is that the accuracy is always a few degrees off.  I have compared it against an accurate low range thermometer that only reads within a set 10 deg span and I found that the Fluke was about 3 deg off from the correct temperature which believe it or not is really very good when you consider that this unit works over such a wide temperature range.
0,This is a must have for adding 410A, you don't want a slug of liquid hitting your compressor.
0,good
0,I made a power controller for my 1500 watt electric skillet. I was tired of it going from too hot to off with the standard thermostat control. Now my skillet will simmer. I had to add a rather large heat sink. I used the heat sink from a solid state relay I purchased from Amazon.
0,Very reasonable pricing and fast shipping
0,Easy five star for me.  Good instructions.  Easy to use.  Precalibrated for true zero level already.  Put my solar panels at 35 degrees with ease.
0,Thread seal tape, works well if used right.
0,Yes, this board is very strong, double side, to solder any small circuit. I use one three times, solder, unsolder, solder again!	Mistake happen, but this board is the best if you make a mistake soldering electronics parts.	1000% recommendation!
0,Really like this vacuum for the price it does a pretty good job, haven't compared it to much else but it's cleaned up everything that I've thrown at it. But with a fa-breeze filter it leaves the place smelling nice.
0,I WAS VERY PLEASED
0,Great
0,Great Product! Got exactly what I paid for!
0,This wet vac is a convenient size that does the job for small jobs.		This is not a unit for big jobs; it is obviously designed for cleaning out the car, pet messes, small water spills, cleaning dusty small furniture pieces and more.		Before you use it: read the instructions. This unit comes with both wet and dry filters - which is great! The wet foam filter is stored under the blue dry filter. Take them apart and Be sure to secure the correct filter before use.		The hose is only four foot. Most of mine are six foot with extensions, so it took a bit to get a feel for it.		This fit perfectly in the floor of my car. I was able to quickly vacuum the dog hair, sediment and everyday debris. (For pet hair, loosen with a Carrand Lint and Hair Removal brush first. It is ,available on Amazon.)		It is small enough to fit under some beds, so you can pull the unit along while vacuuming the dust bunnies.		It easily stores on a shelf or in a closet.		I did not feel like it had quite the suction power as my five gallon Vacmaster. Still, it does well with small water spills and small jobs- which is what it is made for,
0,This product is superb for my clients
0,It seems to do the job.
0,As described, sticks well and conducts electricity decently well through the sticky side.
0,outstanding,  very heavy aluminum, very sturdy
0,Great
0,This isn't a massive assortment of different size nuts and bolts, and naturally does not represent everything you might ever need, say, for automotive applications.  But for the price it is a useful assortment that definitely can come in handy.  And honestly I often will find a use for a nut or bolt on my own, in addition to replacing a given size of bolt or nut, and in that case the exact size doesn't really matter as much.  It is actually very hard to find a relatively complete and well rounded assortment of nuts and bolts that isn't hundreds of dollars, (I've only found one other one that is actually much more complete and very useful, which I believe is made by Dorman and sells for around 25 dollars), and my theory is because the companies would rather you go into Lowes or HD each time and pay a few bucks for a little bag that contains what you need, not to mention that you may find other stuff you need while you're there.  Lest you think this somewhat of a conspiracy theory, you should know I have looked MANY times in Lowe's and NEVER found a simple assortment of WOOD SCREWS!!  Could there be something more basic for an assortment??  But they want you to buy a separate pack of each size.  Walmart, on the other hand, of course sells assortments of wood screws.  But back to the topic at hand, good luck finding a large variety of nuts and bolts, its not too easy.
0,I'm using this as a print surface for 3d printing nylon. The sheet I received was very flat and in perfect condition. I had to apply a layer of glue to decrease adhesion since the nylon was sticking enough to rip off part of the phenolic sheet with it.
0,This is a good assortment of small wire nails. I have only used a few but am glad I had the assortment to choose from when I did.
0,Well made and inexpensive. I'll be using these for future projects.
0,Works well, use it to secure large items from movement when needed. Reusable.
0,This is the thin sheet metal version adapter sold by most hardware stores.  This one has heavy construction, is nicely finished, and of very high quality.  I expect this fitting will stand up to many years of daily use.  Well worth the higher cost.
0,Great color fast shipping packed perfectly. Wish I had more lol
0,Good price, all work well.
0,tuff as nails, long lasting, priced right
0,This is SO much better than vinyl tubing.  No kinks or permanent dents in the hose and far more flexible.  Love it!  Worth the extra cost.
0,A do it yourself experiments dream. Lots-o-LEDs at a good price.
0,I had all I could handle getting this magnet mounted! It's as strong as the name implies. Next time I'll use a brass fitting, and avoid a brain-bending wrestling match, magnet vs steel
0,Got this to add to a Space Bag for storing partial rolls of 3D printing Filament.  Minimize moisture absorbed by the filament.  So far is working well, haven't had the occasion to have to renew the Silica Gel yet but expect no problem when I have to.
0,works with ease
0,works as intended
0,Perfect for a 90 day supply of tiny pills.  Easy to open for those of us with hands that are not so strong anymore.  Perfect straight sides to allow the pills to get out easy without them suddenly all pouring like the huge ones the pharmacy gives us.		No, they are not child proof.  These are not for young people.  :-P
0,Wanted to try ABS filament and this didn't disappoint. Probably pretty standard stuff. Worked, what else is there to say.
0,With all the Digital tools and calipers around I began to notice that without Batteries the shop is down!  Now I have most of my tools Dial and adjustable with test bars and weights.
0,Great stuff, it glues and glues strong. I have been using it for putting model figures together and cannot ask for a better product. It is easy to use and holds really well. Even withstood my two year man handling an 8" figure I am working on and then dropping it on the floor. No breakage at all!
0,As advertised!
0,Great quality!  Highly recommend!
0,It was the first brand i tried and after 2 other manufacturers and nothing feeds aswell and is as consistant so far as SainSmart. It is more money but well worth it.		Best results i get are at 215c
0,This is some easy to use product worthy of the name gorilla glue
0,Has met my needs around the village. I usually use it for measuring to order the correct parts.
0,This is a great air chuck.
0,It is just what I needed in the appropriate quantity and price.
0,This is great. It works well, and we are now able to make mozzarella regularly.
0,strong and adhered well to the edge strip on my pic up bed cover to fasten the vinyl.
0,Worked great. Follow the instructions.
0,It's WD-40! It's great! This version has the option to spray out of the straw, or turn it downwards and spray out of the nozzle! I don't know why I'm so excited! Lubrication!
0,Work well, could be sharper.
0,Strong and reliable. Size delivered was correct and matched the picture.
0,Bought this and well gave it as a gift. She loved it.  Never got a chance to see the day where she would make me a waffle. She's gone now.  Just like her whore face with my waffle maker! I kid.  Still.  No waffles and that makes me sad.
0,Great product, awesome value
0,This plumbing tape is wider than cheap tape I have bought in the past.  It seems higher in quality and the spray head I attached to a hose has not leaked since it was attached, so it is working as expected.
0,Good quality measuring set.
0,Has some great sticking power...  I'm using this to hold the vinyl belly of an RV back together after working on the insides.	I plan to post in a couple of months if it held.
0,A lot of glue for this price... CA is always such a mess - not sure if all of the tips are really necessary...
0,I no longer fear going for gasoline for the mower or other power equipment. The plastic gas can I had been using could slide or tip in the trunk, I always had the thought of being rear ended with a plastic gas can in the trunk. I love this heavy duty 2.5 gallon metal can. The sturdy handle and heavy duty spring makes a tight seal (the inside of the cover appears to have a cork gasket). This can has a low center of gravity so there is a decreased chance of tipping while in the trunk. The galvanized steel construction and screen in the filler neck augments safety not found on plastic cans. The cost difference was only a few dollars over a plastic type can. Last night the gas can stayed outside, this morning I pulled it out of the snow to fuel the snow blower. This is a very sturdy well designed can.
0,What can i say about paper towel.....? Its good. It dries your hand. It cleans and pick up the spillage...whatever else you read...hmmm...its just paper towel..you cannot go wrong! Great price and great quality...
0,This yeast had no problem getting going very strongly when I sprinkled even a partial packet in a gallon of must. I've used a few packets, and I've got plenty of packets in the fridge waiting to go. I didn't know how yeast would do coming from an Amazon warehouse and being shipped in warm weather, but I had it shipped to Texas in April with no ill effects. It's working great.
0,Excellent water filter
0,I have used Marine goop in the past and prefer it over silicon adhesives.  So I wouldn't run out of it, I bought 5 tubes to use on my boat.
0,Great. We use these for our BUG OUT BAG.
0,I use this to monitor the humidity level in a safe and it does the trick.  I have plenty of warning when I need to recharge the desiccant.		Update: I bought another to monitor the temp and humidity in my basement and Im happy with both the original unit and second purchase.
0,Great!  Just enough flexibility
0,Great choice and good buy for the money. Nice value.
0,Good price and fast shipping. We use these for blending essential oils and vape flavors. They work exceptionally well for that. They're RELATIVELY accurate and cheap enough to truly be disposable. Weill happily order again.
0,very happy with purchase

0,Its duct tape. Its made by 3M. Why wouldnt you have this?
0,Needed some odds and ends hardware. These were OK.
0,These probes work with my husband's Fluke 86 and are very good for reading voltage without stripping the wire's insulation.  The precision points provided allowed him to read the voltage status on surface mounted devices and worked very well with breadboard projects.  The tips are easy to change out and the probes handle well for being smaller than normal meter probes.  Overall, it's a good set of probes and he's pleased with them.
0,must have for the electro simulator.  makes all the difference when using must have!!!
0,Works well for my Bostitch Smart Point 18GA Brad Nailer. Actual measurements in mm is 1.05 x 1.25 x 37.89.
0,A lot of power, just keep on top of maintenance. I live in a small apartment which I keep pretty clean, used this about once a week and the filters were all clogged pretty quickly...guess its dustier than I thought in here. Cleaned everything out in the sink and you can feel it hugging the rug again now.
0,I've only had the first sheets of buildtak for a few days and I love that the surface is extremely durable and some of my prints stick very well to it. I've had moments where the initial layers didn't stick but it took some tweaking of settings in my slicer to get the effect I wanted. Glad I got this, over painters tape,
0,They used to be made in the USA, but now China. I'll see how they hold up.
0,This is my second 3d Printer  i ordered the CR-10  the first time,  this one has a lot smaller build plate, but it's rock solid  No error no mess ups  Hit Print and it makes it, Very nice just as quick and Looks awesome on your desk =)  Thanks
0,I used it on 2-3mm glass-reinforced epoxy laminate sheets FR4. It gets the job done, but do not expect it to cut anything hard easily.
0,My wife bought me a similar product years ago but it had this annoying beep every time it took a reading. this one is silent. so nice :)
0,Timely delivery, Good Price
0,Can't really get these wrong.
0,works for getting the juice out of my tanks..
0,They showed up on time, were well-packaged, and worked great.		On the flip side, they were expensive for what they are.		Right now, electronic parts are still affordable and available.	This may not be the case when all electronics manufacturing occurs outside of the United States.
0,This is and excellent tape for repairing pex lines
0,fantastic stuff! Don't try and use it like duct tape and follow some basic steps in prepping your surface and this stuff will stick and stay!
0,I ordered this product from Hardware Sales Inc. via Amazon Online and the product was received without any negative issues.  I found the product to be exactly as advertised.  It complimented my supply of Kreg screws.  I am very pleased with the vendor/product and plan to order more with the need arises.  I would recommend this product to others without reservation.
0,Product was as advertised, quality seems good.
0,I have been using this for about 5 days.  No problems at all. Just learning how to use 3D printers and this one has been	a excellent one to start and learn on.	The print does so much more than I had ever hoped for. I have used 1/3 a reel of filament in 4 days, so many more things and tools to make and repair.
0,They appear to be as advertised.
0,Works great,
0,Fixed my clogging problems with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/V6-clone-from-J-Head/dp/B010MSTVZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">V6 clone from J-Head</a>&nbsp;which has incorrectly designed heat-break (gets the filament melted before its throat). So now my Delta Kossel Mini printing ABS  without issues.
0,Works well, but came with dead batteries
0,Looked for a long time to find an electrical switch lube, and here it is.  Great product, great price!
0,No problems.
0,This stuff is great bought a small amount first then upgraded to the bigger one if you have a 3D printer this stuff is it must have. Don't wait until your parts wear out before trying to lubricate them that's just stupid keep them well lubricated so they don't wear out.
0,they work real good no problems at all with them for the money i will reorder them again
0,The product is good but the applicator cap is less than I expected.  There is no cap to fit the applicator once you have opened the tube. Silicone has good consistency and stick.
0,I only wish I started using this stuff years ago
0,Quality meh, performance is meh, rating: meh. It does come with a battery so that was pretty good, but overall meh.
0,This was one of several products I got for my zipline. I was looking for a large turnbuckle because I knew that the length of the run I was going for (~120 ft)  with 1/4" cable would mean I would have to have a very sturdy turnbuckle. It was a struggle to get the cable loop to the turnbuckle but once I hooked it up, 9" of travel meant I could tighten up the cable very nicely. I have no complaint about this product at all and it looks incredibly strong and  well-made.
0,I was previously using a card table for storage and potting. After awhile the rain pretty much made it so cluttered and unusable I purchased this. It's a great deal and is very sturdy and the rain won't ruin it. The only thing I'd like to see is a way to make the shelves adjustable to accommodate different items. I'm glad I purchased it.
0,I was wondering if i was wasting my money when I ordered Plasti-dip, but it works well. It is easy and near fool proof. A couple of tips would be to move slow. Dip slow, extract slow. Start with a good clean surface and don't try to push the drying time. Again, be slow; with patience the results are great. Take extra care in sealing your partial can. If air gets to it it will start to harden. I found a bit of grease inside the rim of the plastic lid makes an effective seal and keeps my product ready for long periods.
0,Works okay.
0,A bit like this at Lowe's  will run $40+.  The bit is great and drills very smooth holes, even in thin plastic and metal with no backing support.
0,I bought this to hang a new shower dispenser, and it's working really well. I didn't even use the little tubes that came with the dispenser. Great product.
0,nice selection -
0,Great product thanks.
0,Sealed well
0,Living in the country you always question your water. So this is one test thats helps decide if its too hard. Hard water is not good for you water system
0,Great stuff.  I have all of their colors and they are all equally great.  I got my spool of orange as a gift.
0,Delivery on time, the item meets my expectation.
0,great product, good buy
0,As expected
0,Very sturdy trash can.  I wish it had a way to get the lid off more easily and it would be great if it could be attached.  I can't keep the lid on when I put the trash out because the lid may get thrown off by the collector and if it goes into the street it could get run over.  Not sure if it would break if that happened.  I'm thinking of chaining the lid on the can. Maybe that will work.
0,Good reamer
0,Works really Dang good- I am reworking the wiring in a RV and It has 110 and 12 volt in it. The prior owners cut a lot of wires and I had no clue where they went to. So I bought this. At Hdepot the unot was 69.95 and that was too much. I had the red wire tracker and it was crap and died. This was loud and sensitive. I just didn't care for that they took 9volt batteries. I like AA Or AAA.
0,Perfect for what I needed.
0,This review refers to the Endoscope model TD0310 with the 5 m cable.  A specialist accessory received for evaluation and review.  There are a whole range of uses for this versatile tool, but in a nutshell, it allows a thorough investigation of small, dark, hidden, out-of-range spaces.  The idea is the same as the medical version, a long flexible tube with a camera head (8.5 mm in this case) and some strong LED lights to illuminate the way at one end and a standard USB connector at the other.  The camera resolution offers a very useful quality range: up to 600 x 1200 pixels, and the images we get are really sharp, especially after a little experimentation.  The ability to regulate the light intensity is a definite asset.  This unit is waterproof and appears to be very tough and fit for the its intended applications;  some examples: investigating the state of a location out of reach of fingers and eyesight; locating an obstruction inside a tube or conduit (even full of water); verifying the condition of the back of appliances that cannot be moved; car repairs.  It's the sort of thing that, once you own it, you will find many uses for, that are not immediately apparent.		We initially tested it by photographing the inside of a Hummingbird electrified guitar.  The output jack had worked loose once again (it had already been sent back for professional remedial action once).  Due to the very limited space inside the guitar body, just enough for a slim hand, it was essential to know the exact situation.  We had already spent a lot of frustrating time trying to screw the piece back on.  Once the Endoscope head had been put into position, we were able to view the whole area and identify both the problem and the solution.  We fixed the guitar in under one minute.		In the box are the endoscope itself, some small tools that attach to the camera head (a hook, mirror and magnet), software installation CD, and a manual (also on the CD). The software loaded without problems on a laptop running Win 8.1.  Manoeuvring the photo head was easy enough (it would be even easier inside a tube), taking still photos and especially video were intuitive and successful.  The other option is to simply view the camera's progress on the screen, but recording the images may be useful.  I was quite blown away by the quality of the images, and the performance of this brilliant diagnostic tool.  I'll be making a video as soon as I have a moment, but for now I'll just post some photos and a screenshot taken from video footage.
0,Great glue, tough as nails, but you seldom get the amount you pay for. this time I only received about an inch of glue measured internally from the bottom of the container up, worked out to be around 8g vs the 14.2 stated on the bottle... 5 star glue, 1 star consistent volumes.
0,Fast delivery and good product!
0,When growing in soil, it wasn't a big deal to measure amounts to feed by ounces per gallon, use a color chart to check PH, etc. grams per litre, etc. Theres a better chance to catch and correct a mistake made in a soil grow. Theres a very little window of time, if any, to correct hydro grow mistakes. Its much more important to measure precisely. I choose APERA for the necessary tools to measure concisely and consistently. Compared to most other brands, especially those that are less expensive, APERA probes have a bigger LCD that displays more info in larger characters that are easier to read. Each of my APERA probes came in a case that holds a complete kit including precalibrated solutions. Being able to precisely measure has given me increased confidence and has helped prevent a couple of growing disasters. Highly recommended.
1,I really wanted to like this product.  Our house is mostly carpeted, except for the kitchen, bathrooms, and hardwood in the hall/entryway.  It can be a pain to drag out the regular vacuum to do a quick cleanup, so I thought a stick vacuum would work well.		On the plus side, this unit was easy to put together.  On the down side, it barely works!  It can pick up bigger things, like a piece of dropped food, but nothing else. Little pieces of dirt, grass, etc. just get blown around.  Plus charging it takes forever and it loses power VERY quickly.		The handheld vacuum attachment sounds like a good idea in theory, but it's pretty lame also.		Didn't anyone test this before putting it on the market?  Honestly, I don't recommend it.
1,Quality of Solutech filament now varies greatly from order to order/spool to spool/color to color that it is no longer worth my paying a premium price.
1,Material is not glossy on the spool, it is very very rough and dusty.  Material is not smooth either,  entire roll looks as if it was dragged through a set of gear wheels.  Attempting to run within the recommended material specs results in delamination,  globs of material everywhere and severe stringing.		I tried drying it for 12 hours and it did  not improve the situation.		After discussing it with the community (3D Printer Cult EXTREME) on Facebook the consensus is this is bad material,  other people in the group have had similar experiences.		EDIT:  I just threw away print number 16,  switched to MG Chem PETG and printed the same item with no problem.  After careful consideration the material will be sent back for a refund.
1,It doesn't really work too well. It's a week old and I cannot hold it and turn it on with the same hand. I have to hold it with one hand than use the nail/finger of my other to turn it on. Also it kind of wiggles; wouldn't call it vibrating or pulsating or oscillating.
1,Water based.  Water dissoves it.	It will be washed away by water after it drys, if it drys.	Has consistency of plain yogurt.	(In fact, plain Yogurt drys faster and makes a better sealant.)		Do not use in bathroom.  Do not use in humid climate.  Do not use near water.  Never get water on it.
1,Not very useful.  the sizes I need are not adaptable.	I have a output of 2" dia. this connection does not fit	the output hose.
1,I tried to resolve the issue through Lake Charles but they would not help as this was an Amazon purchase. Disappointed.
1,Button doesn't work well and the light flickers like crazy. Difficult to hold button in just the right spot to get the light to stay on consistently.
1,I tried cutting a 3/4" hole in 1/8" steel. The drill didn't make it past 1/2" hole and I was using cutting oil. This was the first of 6 holes I needed to drill. Returned for a refund.
1,In the image these say the bristles are stainless but they are not.
1,It's a phony.
1,I bought two of these and put them side by side.  They were 2 degrees off each other temperature wise.  One was 2 degrees lower than a known good thermometer.  They were 5% off of each other for humidity.
1,Quality of Solutech filament now varies greatly from order to order/spool to spool/color to color that it is no longer worth my paying a premium price.
1,Pure crap. Almost destroyed printer.
1,Vulkem brand not sold at local big box store.  I used this to seal around my vinyl window after initial installer's silicone caulk peeled.  I got a fresh tube and the sealant flowed out easily.  I used a battery powered caulk gun so I can't tell how much pressure is needed if using a manual caulk gun.  I know the label recommended using soapy water to smooth out the sealant but I used WD40 instead and it came out smooth.  Only time will tell if this holds up.		Update (1/2017):  During a rainy spell, window frame started leaking inside at the top of both ends.  Went out to look and this sealant had shrunk and peeled off the window at both ends.  This was caulked no less than a year ago.  I guess I'll go back to using 100% Silicone for windows from now on.  The time, expense and incurring water damage from using this product is very disappointing to say the least.  Not recommended for windows or any smooth surfaces due to adhesion problems!
1,Very high quality product except for one flaw:  The speculum falls off during use.  It "screws"' onto the device (kind of) but not in a sincere or secure way. My wife is an RN, and even she could not use the device without the speculum falling off. Who wants a problematic device?		I ordered this based in large part on the reviews, but there is no way this device is usable in the real-world.  Could be a defective unit, but the design of the method of attachment just seems wrong.  A simple threaded end (like on so many other products) would solve this problem.		I have requested a return to Amazon and will order a different product.
1,It took me about 30 seconds to determine that the one I just received was junk. No software CD included as advertised first of all and secondly, the switch wouldn't move. I did plug it in an USD socket and my 'puter recognized that a new piece of hardware was plugged in but that's all. Maybe if the manufacturer had at least included the software, I may have been able to do a work around. I'll see if I can find a decent though a different brand. Back to AMAZON for a refund
1,I found this difficult to deal with.  First, as others have commented, it was difficult to attach with a cover on my android so I used a cable.  That really didn't work well for me because it was hard to aim.  There is a delay in the refresh rate so when you aim it at something it takes a second or two to "materialize".  By that time you are not sure where you have aimed it if you are holding it by hand and if you are still there. Further, I did not find a way to overlay a photograph on the thermal image as some cameras do.  I was "lost" looking at globs of color.  I attempted to focus but with the combined bouncing around and refresh delay it was very difficult.		 I am a novice at thermal imaging.  Perhaps someone with more experience knows how to do this better such as a stationery mount of some sort.  But for my application where I want to move around easily I found holding the camera apart from the smart phone cumbersome and impractical.  I am returning this camera and am investigating FLIR cameras which are more expensive but they  do overlay the thermal image with an optical image so you know where you are, and exactly what is causing the temperature variations.  The overlay feature is worth the extra money for me.
1,No clear description on the correct settings to use this filament. I received this filament with an insert card stating to use nozzle temperature of 230c. That's not a common PLA temperature, and the temperature on the product details is 190-220. Same on the filament website directly at 3d solutech's website. I tried to contact them to clarify, but I got no response. So instead of risking it, I returned it since the description doesn't match the actual product you get.
1,If anyone knows of some generic 2x4  pads to replace these, please let all of us know!  The Compex snap contacts SUCK, but everyone already knows that.
1,The picture is misleading. Super thin walled. The tubing burst on me first use. Save your money and look for something else!
1,These are a piece of crap. Spend the money and buy the blue lab PH tester. I used to swear by these but they would go out at least once a year. Not only that they need to be calibrated much more often than the blue lab. If you use this, you should be calibrating at least once a week.
1,You absolutely get what you pay for here. Will this work? Yeah probably. But the quality is absolutely nowhere near what you would get by paying more for a real E3D. The heat break on mine came bent and the heater block itself was threaded so crooked that part of the bore was still smooth. The heater block itself is clearly hand made (not a good thing when you're talking about machine equipment, really) and done so using a bandsaw. It's not symmetrical and is clearly made out of softer aluminum.		The heat sync is alright, though I imagine that's because it was probably made by a machine. The nozzle and all the bowden parts are also fine. Basically, if you are buying this to get "most of the parts you need" to put together a decent hot end, then the price is great. As an out of the box for a good reprap project, its garbage and you'd be better off with a j-head.
1,Not a great teaching tool. It's a little tricky getting it to rest on the stand.
1,Trash
1,Did not include SD card and reader. Z-axis guides do not line up with Z-axes threaded rods. Heated bed produces hot spots. Extruder spring is way to tight. Does not have a power switch. LCD and user interface is laggy and unresponsive. Power supply does not fit properly into the mounting holes. Instructions are nearly non-existent. Controller board can not accept additional extruder. Belts have no tensioner spring. Included PLA filament is bottom of the barrel crap. Does not list specs, firmware, schematics or any other type of information.		The only real 'pro' to the entire review and machine is that it works and I can use it to build a quality printer.
1,It is not tape, nor is it shrink tape. I have never used a shrink tape that does not stick long enough to heat it. Also when heated it does not seal.	What am I doing wrong with this tape and do the same thing with a good product that really works. I already opened it and tried it several times,, crap!
1,theyll do the job but don't press too hard or they might break
1,OK...  first off...  this is a vulcanizing repair kit... not a hard epoxy or fiberglass.  It is sandable when it has cured fro at least 24 hours (any earlier and it just shreds like a plastic shopping bag) but it does not blend or feather well.  When applying this product for a tub repair, you want to be fairly spartan with it because, like I mentioned, it is a vulcanizing epoxy, so sanding it down is not a good idea.		The main reason I gave this product a bad review is very misleading in what you get.  The description reads thus:		"1.06 OZ, Fiberglass, Porcelain & Plastic Repair Kit, Bonds Fiberglass, Porcelain, Plastic, Ceramic Tensile Strength 1500 Psi, Water Resistant, Handling & Set Time 30 Minutes, White Or Almond. This product is manufactured in China. Excellent for industrial and domestic use."		But you don't get a fiberglass repair kit... you get an off-white 2 part vulcanizer (NOT glass resin) with a small piece fiberglass cloth in the kit.  Including a piece of glass matt does not make this a fiberglass repair kit.\\		I guess I need to learn to read better...  as soon as I saw "made in China" on the kit I knew it was going to be garbage, and I was not surprised by the results.		I own a small handyman business and if I would have used this on a customer's tub, I'd be repairing it again at my own cost.  Don't buy this product unless you want to incur the same BS results.  Just go buy a small fiberglass patch kit at the hardware store.  You'll be a lot happier with the results when you're done.
1,Well i will start by saying that for the price, i got what i paid for.	The bottom of the bowl has a few cracks/chips.  Not that it broke but it looks like it shrunk while it was being fired.	The bowl and mortar is a bit porous, should be ok for some chemicals but not good at all for avoiding contamination.	It might be a case of having one set per chemical.	I would hope the quality control on these would improve, if it does i can see ordering more but as it stands, no i wouldnt recommend them.
1,I bought this to go with my new shop sink.  I also bought the gallon of liquid soap shown on Amazon that is a suggested co-purchase.  I guess I did not look at the reviews because it can not be used with the suggested soap or just any liquid soap.  Furthermore I could not get it to open.  Now that I found out I won't be using it that doesn't matter whether I can open it or not.		I don't see any reason to purchase any device or product based upon the ink jet cartridge system.  It also doesn't appear that well constructed so it probably wouldn't hold up to moderate use.  I would suggest another soap dispenser.		It took longer to fabricate the sink cabinet so I did not get around to installing the soap dispenser until it was too late to return.  I fault Amazon and the supplier for not providing information on how this product must be used.  There is no excuse for omitting critical information from the displayed product literature nor suggesting soap that can't be used in the device.
1,Does not work as expected .cannot get cal and will not print larger model,
1,Worst abs that I've ever used.  This stuff doesn't extrude easily or print smoothly.  I've never had so many headaches with printing anything on my flash forge x before.  Maybe I got a bad batch?  Not sure but switching out other brands instantly fixed my issue here
1,Real cheasy, threads vary tops are not uniform. AND the paint chips off if you just look at it.
1,Sign faded within about 3 months to half the color.  After 4 months, you can hardly read them.
1,Stopped working after using it four times in a two month period. Replaced with a GB tester that had really crappy reviews, and it has worked for over 12 months now. Looks like its a coin toss as to which one will last.		The fluke was so bad even when it worked that you never knew if power was on or off. Must have just been a bad one. Others having good luck so give it a shot.
1,I'm giving it a one star because I bought five of these and put one in each door of my tool chest downstairs. The relative humidity is 46%, but ever canister went from red to white in less than one week. I don't live in Florida for crying out loud, I live in Minnesota with a walk out basement. 46% relative humidity isn't bad. My tools (which have been in my basement workshop for 30 years, have never rusted, so these desiccants are	useless for me. Yes I know I can put then in the range and reuse them, but every week? No thanks.		Update: I got a small dehumidifier (here on Amazon) and that does the trick.
1,So this is a great printer when I was working. Great prints for the money nice look and easy to use. After about 5 days the glass on printing bed just cracked buy xyz said they send me a new one. Ok... but 2 days later now the heating elelement for the extruder now will not work. They said they send that too. So we will see how that works out. Just not happy it's brand new and all ready having problems. Customer service said i need to pay for shipping ship in the bad parts then wait for them to get them and then they will ship them out. This is only a week old!! Amazon is just going to replace the whole printer. If i didn't spend like $150 in filament and use it i would return it all and get my money back!! DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK IF YOU WANT A GOOD 3D PRINTER SPEND NO LITTLE THEN $1000. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR in this case CRAP!!!!
1,Beware! Tip broke off!		In all my years using these kinds of plugs Ive never had one destroy another piece of equipment.	After 2-3 uses, the tip of this broke off inside a jack.  I was stunned.  It is impossible to remove the tip, now I must attempt a repair on that gear and replace the jack.		Avoid these!  If you insist on buying these check my garbage can for 9 more unused plugs.	I will not risk the destruction of any more gear with these.		(Amazon - why no zero star ratings possible?)
1,I bought this to place on my mailbox stand that is made of wood. I placed it up at night and the next morning and was on the ground. I was hoping to save the sticker but it was stuck together and would not open.		It is a very cheap sticker, nothing more. I would not buy or recommend to anyone.
1,My I3 3D printer uses 24vdc and the RAMPS had 16vdc capacators
1,First spool was a tangled mess.  I was issued a return spool. It is also a tangled mess. Unfortunate because it's a great color just not up to par andtomany failed prints
1,Not to happy with this. Does not deburr Aluminum very well in both directions. Works great one direction but not both. It digs in to much.
1,Delivery was prompt and Amazon fullfillment made a return easy, but the unit did not work as received. I am pretty familiar with these types of devices but readings were eratic with swings of multiple hundreds of RPM's, an approximate 30% varying error. I tried painting a large flat black backdrop before placing the reflective tape and it made no difference.
1,did not fit in the hotend hole on the block..	not sure if these are the epcos or something else. first print with this i set for 180 it came out black burnt goo.
1,Unfortunately I was not impressed. To start with, they give you one applicator sponge and one mixing cup - that's done after the first time you use it. If you want to use this stuff, make sure you buy more of those two things.		Mixing it is easy enough, just like any two part epoxy. Applying it is also basic enough. However, it's far from as good of end quality as is shown in advertisements. It takes a very long time to dry fully. The whole time it is drying, it is slowly seeping so make sure it stays on a surface that you don't mind getting messed up. Once fully dry it still leaves some defects. It cannot be sanded, it gets really weird when sanding. So you can either apply more and wait another 24 hours or just deal with the defects that remain.
1,There was no set screw or any way to secure the thermister in the heat block so I couldn't get an accurate reading. Ended up having to use the heat block from my old hotend on this one. If it wasn't for that, I would have given it 4 stars.
1,I wasn't planning on writing a review of this product, but because of Amazon's insistant email requests, I'll do so, just so I can get on with my life.  This is in no way an attempt to discredit this product or the company supplying it.  It is only my opinion based on my experience using the paste they sent me.		I have used diamond paste for decades, from putting mirrored finishes on hardened tooled edges to bringing scratched, delicate watch crystals back to their original condition.  Diamond paste is the perfect medium for taking fine and not-so-fine scratches out of most any hard material.  I was attracted to TEMO because of the low price.  It's far less than the other supplier I've purchased my DP from in the past.  Especially after volume is considered.  This paste looks exactly like my more expensive brand, has the same consistency, but comes in a 5 gram tube, more than twice the size of that sold by my regular supplier.  Based on those criteria, it truly was a great deal.		To date, I've only found one drawback with TEMO's paste...		It appears to have no diamond in it.		I refer to mine as "Diamond Paste Placebo".  If you've never used diamond paste before and use TEMO's paste with a "wool polisher" as they recommend, you might be impressed with the results.  What you wouldn't know, is using a wool polisher by itself, will brighten things up... That's why they call them "Wool Polishers".&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Meguiar-s-Cut-N-Shine-8-Wool-Buffing-Pad/dp/B0002NYE3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Meguiar's Cut N' Shine 8" Wool Buffing Pad</a>.		At most, this "diamond paste placebo" or whatever you want to call it, might lubricate the wool, but will most likely ruin it by clogging it up and causing grit to embed itself into it.  If you're going to use a machine to polish with diamond, such as a Hira-To scissor sharpening device, a thin, metal-backed felt pad would probably be the closest thing to wool that you'd want to use.  I don't own such a machine, so I can't comment on TEMO's success with this type of pad... But I do know, it doesn't work with any other standard backing material, making the odds that it will work on felt, about zero.		With this paste, using it the way diamond paste should be used, properly; I wasn't able to remove the finest scratches on R120 durometer plastic, much less anything harder.  Rouge (on a buffing wheel) does a better job.		From now on I'll buy my diamond from my other supplier<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DMT-DPK-Dia-Paste-Diamond-Compound-Kit-of-1-3-and-6-Micron/dp/B000MF7JSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DMT DPK Dia-Paste Diamond Compound Kit of 1, 3, and 6 Micron</a>, thank you...  1 unpolished star from me... And even that's too shiny.
1,These are VERY cheap, thin aluminum.
1,I received this item in gray color instead of black, which is very disappointing. It does not match my fixtures color.
1,This was a nice idea but it didn't work well. Not heavy enough to actually clean and the brushes stopped spinning almost instantly. I sent it back.
1,The description states that it fits the FLIR CM174, it doesn't.  I returned it.
1,I like the design, it probably works but the one I received was too banged up for me to be happy. The housing for the little fan was cracked and prevents it from turning. The barrel was bent between the bottom of the heat sink and the aluminum block.		I tried contacting the company, asking them if would just let me trade my broken fan for a new one: no response.		I used my own dang fan for a while to ameliorate the constant jams to which this barrel is subject and it worked fine... until the barrel snapped at the bent spot. I drilled the broken barrel out, threaded in a spare I happened to have and continued printing that night, but first I ordered a better extruder barrel:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/RepRapDiscount-Hexagon-Full-Metal-Hot-End-Hotend-1-75mm-4mm-nozzle/dp/B00W8FL5BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">RepRapDiscount, Hexagon Full Metal Hot End, Hotend, 1.75mm, .4mm nozzle</a>
1,Tape did not hold up as advertised and I used it on a Poly Tarp Garage with a metal frame.  I put over seams, etc., to provide extra support and the tape basically peeled off in less then 3 months in the AZ sun.  The Gorilla tape is far superior!  I will not order again.
1,I will stick to brass after this. I run 8 3d printers and these steel nozzles seem to peel the first layer as its laying it. oddly none of my brass nozzles do this. I have been printing professionally for 4 years and this is the first and last time i try any steel nozzles.
1,It's very small, difficult to read, it can't tell you within a degree F what the temperature is because the graduations are spaced two degrees apart.  Accuracy?  I don't know; can't tell.
1,The small tools broke almost immediately when lightly milling acrylic plexiglass sheets.
1,I used this product to fill 1/16" - 1/8" gaps on my house's siding last year when I repainted.  It's been 11 months since we painted and this Dap brand caulk is already failing in roughly 75% of the joints.  This stuff is terrible.		Update: reached out to DAP regarding their 40 year warranty and have heard nothing back.
1,keeps breaking
1,I'm not sure if this stuff is needed or how It uniquely cleans.  I wonder if flushing any white filament through dirty nozzles will show contaminants.  I know one thing through experience.  You must run the stuff through quickly and use filament loading and unloading.  Do not run snippets through to the end and hope to push them through with a following filament.  It will clog every time.  I can't blame this material on this behavior.  My main point is I'm not sure it does anything.
1,poor alignment for the pins to the plastic openings. I have had lots of breadboards in the past and am very familliar with using them an many projects. These things have decent pins but the individual alignment is horrible to the openings. Getting a 32-pin chip to plug in is a downright task that takes several minutes of "fiddling" with the pins and alignment to get it in without bending half the pins. - If you can tolerate the mis-alignment they have, they aren't bad, but plugging in a large chip into one will frustrate you to no end.
1,The flange nuts are horrible quality with lots of backlash/loose fit.  The leads themselves are of good quality.
1,Order well packaged but the brightness of most of the colors were low compaired to my present syock. One draw back I should have noticed (my bad) is the word clear. There is little or no diffusion and even loking directly at the led output is low. All tested ok and I will use them.
1,Well it's white, it's silicone acrylic, and I used it around the bathtub.  It's a simple cut the tube tip to a slant (larger or smaller) depending on the amount you will be need to squeeze out and VOILA really!  It was a good price and pretty easy to use.  Two weeks later, it's still there so I can't complain.		3 Weeks later update:  This silicone is no longer white. It is now cream/off-white color now and has a matte finish.  Just letting you know:)  I will not be purchasing again.
1,Used to control the flow of water to cool the outside of a beer fermenter. I should have know there would be a problem when I touched the solenoid and it was hot although 40F water was flowing through it
1,Worked the first time. Second season, the red plastic pump cracked open a few places and I lost suction. Not really reusable for more than one season.
1,I liked it for the first couple prints, but like other people have stated the spool was miswound. I really really wanted to like this companies but now that im moving into bigger production prints i don't know if i would buy again.
1,The instructions are outdated.  It's a minor issue, but not one that'll stop a seasoned electronics vet, but a noobie might trip up on it.  It has a few capacitors with higher voltage ratings than the instructions list.  For me or anyone not new to electronics, you can use the power of deduction and some common sense to figure out where they go.  No biggie.  Could cast doubt for a complete noobie who's just getting into electronics.  But like I said, minor issue.		The MAJOR issue on the other hand, is the front panel they sent me.  It's apparently for some other kit they sell because I had to drill out two of the slide switch holes and also the holes for the potentiometers.  (the holes for the banana jacks were they though, which is weird)  It definitely did not turn out as "pretty" as it could have had it been pre-drilled, but this is crap.  I'd ask for my money back but I had already decided to just drill it but after seeing the ugly results, regretted it since now I can't get my money back.  Apparently no QC goes into these.		As far as performance... it does work.  Fairly well I suppose.  The sine wave isn't very accurate at all.  Square wave is fine.  Ramp looked ok too.		So... all in all, if you want a good function generator, just get a "good" bench function/wave gen.  (Rigol and BK Precision have "cheap" ones that are pretty good for the price for entry level hobbyists)  It's not fair to compare this product to a real function generator, but it sort of is a fair comparison considering you can get a used Agilent, HP, or Tektronix waveform generator on ebay for $50-100.  The brand new Rigol ones start around $379 and they'll do arbitrary waveforms.  BK Precision has ones for $269, and a true DDS one for $309.  I'd recommend going with a used one on ebay or getting a Rigol or BK precision.		Happy soldering!
1,Cheap price, Cheap made.  Bristles pull out way too easily.  Used them to coat my truck frame so I didn't care but for any application where you might see paint, you'll end up with tons of bristles.
1,The water that sprays through this smells like mold spores!  Can't get rid of the smell.  Had to throw them away.
1,Poor spool winding destroyed 5 hr print.
1,Requires a fuse to work, which is not provided.	I assumed the fuse slot was to relocate the fuse you are replacing with this plug, but there are 2 slots, the second is for your new wire-tap	I was connecting a product with a fuse in it, so didn't need another fuse in series.	Since I didn't have a fuse, stalled my project
1,Significant work needed to get a decent print. I had to completely rebuild this printer and use squares, calipers, and other precision instruments to get a decent looking print. The monoprice select mini still prints better out the box even after all that effort.	Update My printer is now stuck in a configuration that only allows positive servo movement while homing. I'm great with electronics and am at my end with this thing. Customer service is nonexistent (knew that before I bought) and  scouring forums has been unfruitful. It's probably going to be mothballed and turned into some sort of frankinprinter down the road.
1,Well it seems to work but the power off button doesn't power it off so had to return.  Will probably get the BK Precision unit or one of the other quality ones.
1,Short! Roughly 30.5 CM or 9 inches long. I had misread the description and was expecting 2 meters in length. However, the description does say that there is supposed to be 1 foot of tubing. (1' is the short form of 1 foot.) Not only was it too short for my expectation, but it was shorter then the description says it will be.
1,I am not impressed with these.  I can not get the smaller bands to fit onto the drums for anything.  I end up destroying the bands before getting them to fit.  The larger bands and drums do work together, they just don't last as long as other brands.  Two starts because I was able to make use of some of the bands, and can use other bands with the drums so it wasn't a total waste of money.  Not worth the money in my opinion.
1,It's way undersized would not feed consistently 2.65mm after a couple of feet
1,This is a useless product. Nothing fits. Too flimsy.  A waste of money.
1,Way too small.  Flimsy, cheap, definitely unsafe for use in any practical wire rope application.  I didn't even bother to to take them out of the package.  Shown in the picture is one of the thimble size I am replacing, which is what I expected to receive, vs this time waster from amazon.  Happy I was able to source my wire rope locally and for a much better price.
1,Didn't work as well as other products.  Would not buy again.  >^..^<
1,Dimensionally accurate, however the unthreaded clearance holes are too small to pass a 3/8" bolt making it impossible to bolt these blocks together. Returned.
1,It's oily. Good luck using this stuff in brewing type things otherwise I guess a rat or varmint would like it ,but I did not buy it for them .. Try a hillbilly website -- soft & no oil -- you'll love it . They have there act together -- I always go there 1st.
1,You need a PROPER dust hood-especially if cutting lead paint. I believe silica-in cement-is a carcinogen too. Do not take a chance as this creates a huge dust storm. I used a 3M NIOSH mask and goggles- both a must, to grind old loose paint off a basement wall for waterproofing and painting. Incredibly difficult job with great results-short of my soreness.		I used a 7"Dewalt grinder and the DustBuddie hood- bad combination, really bad. Diamond wheel recessed in the hood too far and the diamond tool ate the brush on the hood. Huge mess and the hood failed. I contacted Dustless Technologies and they sent a new dust buddie and a shaft-extender- also a bad plan. Shaft extender was eccentric and 3weeks later my shoulders and hands still hurt. No kidding, still have a blister. The hood barely worked, the bearings in the grinder are probably ruined and I nearly choked to death toward the end as the second Dust Buddie rattled to pieces. It was a job I HAD to do by a certain date, so fought through it. Diamond tool and grinder were great-dust Buddie did not.		Do not try this before verifying an un-modified grinder shaft fits your vacuum hood.
1,I have had this unit for 2 1/2 years.  It worked well for about 2 years.  The brush heads wear out within a month and are expensive.  The handle vibration energy is no longer being transferred to the brush head stub, but to the handle body itself.  As a result the handle vibrates like crazy and is very loud.		I had the "Original Sonicare" toothbrush for over 12 years.  It worked flawlessly.  Brush heads lasted six months.  The power button on the unit finally died.  This is the ONLY reason I bought the new unit.  Very disappointing.  Sonicare had a wonderful, original design and ruined it with bells & whistles and a cheaper concept.  However, the price went way up.
1,This product is a great idea but needs to go back to Quikrete R & D as it is not ready to sell to the public yet.  Results DO look great as customer reviews have stated but after two months big patches simply "lift off" the floor revealing the ugly garage floor underneath.  We followed the instructions to the "T", watched the handy video, was pleased with the results until two months later.  I will have to resurface in the spring, probably with a good paint that is a light gray color.  $150 for my double garage is TOO MUCH for a product that does not work.  To any who are excited over their initial results with this product I say write your review AFTER it has been down on the floor for awhile.
1,One star is still to good for this POS.	worked for the first few weeks and then started acting up. Now out of the 30 days Return time. The electronic is freaking out far before you get a battery warning. Will be ok for a short time after changing the Battery. Also it has IP54......yea but only printed on it.....the slightest bit of liquide (water/coolant) and the display goes crazy showing all kinds of readings. You have to hold it dry and once it gets wet the best Methode is to blow with the air gun between scale and electronic to get it cleaned out.	Over all you have to cross check most of the time since you cannot believe the numbers it shows.
1,Not very practical
1,I posted a picture in the customer images section showing the light against skin from this otoscope compared to my LED flashlight.  The light from the otoscope has a blue tint and the colors appear flatter (lower apparent CRI - Color Rendition Index) compared to the LED flashlight.  With the flashlight, the skin looks normal and with the otoscope it looks cold and pale.  The LED bulbs with the higher CRI are newer and more expensive, so the manufacturer has slightly older LED bulb technology in this otoscope.  This is significant because it is harder to make out subtle signs of conditions if the colors are not as vibrant.		Other reviewers noticed the same blue LED tint, for example the previous review here from Kenneth S. Raper, MD where he writes "Also the LED is blue-ish instead of white. Very much like the first generation of 'white' LED string Christmas lights that had a blue tint. This makes eardrums and mucous membranes look odd. It makes it difficult to tell how red a throat is, or if an eardrum is a little red or not. Normal pink mucosa (in a blue-ish light) has a slight purple-ish hue. This is really the only disappointment with the product, but it is significant. I expected a white light."		I wanted to like this product because the price is good, but I'm returning this for a different brand with a halogen bulb for more accurate color.		The product package says "Designed in Texas and manufactured exclusively for Innovative Innovations Inc. in China."		Update: after I posted this review, the manufacturer posted messages trying to attack me on a personal level simply because I didn't like the blue LED.  Then I went through other 1, 2, star reviews and found the same rude behavior from the manufacturer in the follow-up comments to legitimate reviews from doctors and nurses.  A quick web search reveals that this company has highly aggressive marketing tactics for low quality Chinese medical knockoffs, with an F rating from the Better Business Bureau.		Some useful information on the Amazon Customer Discussion forums:		- "Always read the negative reviews. Many fraudsters will post hundreds of positive reviews, but the truth can be hidden in that one genuine negative review thread."		- "Always check the time frame of the reviews. Were the majority of positive reviews written over the course of a very short period of time? This is a red flag."		- "Compare the number of reviews with similar, well-known products. If, for example, an unknown company is selling vitamins with more reviews than Centrum or One-a-Day, this is certainly a red flag."
1,You can get casters cheaper at surpluscenter.com With standard 1/2" studs		The casters seem to be good but the metric studs and no nuts included sucks. I had to drive a minimum of 38 miles to get nuts.		How'd that work out for me? Not so well. I just as well drove to buy casters in the first place
1,******* UPDATE *********	Granted, you probably want to use up your filament as quickly as possible, but reality is, filament gets used when it gets used.  This update is to state that this roll of filament is starting to get used more.  The roll is now about 60-75% used up and the filament cracks and snaps on its own.  Meaning, it either becomes brittle as time goes by or the filament is really rigid and holds more of a more aggressive arc towards the center of the spool than the outer layers and is under a lot of tension when stretched to the print-head.		I'm not reducing stars for this update, but rest assured, this will be my last roll of this filament.	****************************		I really wanted to like this filament.  That statement sounds so cliche, but here's why.  It's really not because I've known great things about this filament or the company was started by a family friend or anything like that.  In fact, none of those are true.  I really wanted to like this filament because "for the most part", PLA is PLA across the board and... I ran out of black.  Each one has its own quirks, but this filament... it puts on a whole freak show on its own.  The other reason why I really wanted to like this filament is because I'm currently working on a prototype quad and I'm printing arms right now.  I just printed the fronts in Makerbot White, and as the fronts were still warm off the printer, the Repko Black arrives and I start printing the rear arms.  So, it's mostly due to excitement about getting all the arms printed and I can start getting the electronics together.  Let's just say, I spent practically a whole day printing the rear arms and they are still not printed.  So, the printer had been running all night and all day, without changing slicer settings or anything.  Models were not changed and when I switch to the Repko filament, production comes to a stop.		As far as design and printing experience goes, I'm no noob.  As far as filaments go, I'm somewhat of a noob, since experimenting with everything out there is just not financially viable for people who are not sponsored or evaluators (for free) in some way or form.  I have tried filament from several companies such as Makerbot, Hatchbox, Paradym, and a few others.  So again, as far as I see it, "for the most part", PLA is PLA.		I have a Makerbot 5th Generation and... as much as I also would like to say I love it, I've had to gut it and rebuild it to make it reliable.  That has nothing to do with the filament, just that I've stabilized the platform where any irregularities are not coming from the printer.  I normally leave my extruder temperature to 210-215c and most PLA will do just fine and go up and down 5c depending on how things go is about all that is needed.  I pretty much leave my extrusion ratio at about 1.05 and every PLA flows great.		Now, I do know the difference between new PLA and old, neglected PLA.  Yes, the popping and the steam coming out of the nozzle are present with old PLA.  You also have to bump up the extrusion ratio just a bit also.  There is no steaming or popping coming from this PLA so it's pretty fresh.		Now for the guts of the review.		This PLA doesn't have enough pigment in it.  Whatever the extruder is able to lay down on the print bed is very translucent.  Layer height maybe?  No.  I'm working on a prototype so the layers are nice and thick at 0.4mm x 0.3mm layer height.  The filament shouldn't be this translucent.  "Give it a couple layers" you say?  I like to print 3 top and bottom layers and 3 shells.  After about 5 layers at 0.3mm, it's still pretty translucent.  I'm not really a fan of the Makerbot filament because it is pretty finicky when it starts getting old, but I'll say this about the Makerbot filament: I can print down a single layer at 0.1mm layer height with a 0.2mm nozzle and the filament is SOLID black.  I didn't go with Makerbot filament because it's pretty expensive for what it is.		The other factor I'd like to review is the extrusion ratio.  Most PLA I put through my extruder is extruded at 1.05.  This filament extrudes hair-thin at 1.05.  I bumped it to 1.15.  Same thing.  Ok, without betting too redundant, I eventually bumped it to 1.75 and it's still under-extruding and still very translucent.  The print failed at 1.75 @ 210c by the way.		I read a review on another black PLA (I forget which one) but the reviewer said, "The filament is a little on the thin side (1.72mm) but you aren't getting less PLA.  A kg is a kg, so you're getting more lineage."  I totally agree with this.  Apply this statement here and the same is true that a kg is a kg.  However, if you have to almost double your extrusion ratio to get it to extrude the proper amount of filament, then this becomes a pretty expensive filament.		One reviewer here said this filament prints best at 210c.  I set my extruder to 210c and the same thing happens.  Not to take away credit or perhaps 210c worked well on his printer, but I was ALMOST able to get adequate extrusion at 1.25 @ 220c.  It's still translucent and under extruded but it's the best setting that I can get from this filament so far.  I believe this filament has a density-consistency issues - maybe.		On the positive side, the filament was nicely vacuum sealed and I was a bit sad that there was no silica gel pack.  Well, I found it.  It was stuffed on the inside of the spool, so that's nice.		Well, I really wanted to like this filament, and I like the idea of giving less-known brands a shot instead of giving all my money to the top brands, but I guess like they say, "stick with name brands".
1,They work, but there are a few things I don't like, such as: the wires are really too stiff, the welded ball on both are not great in fact one is very poor, one of the wire's strain relief does work and the wire twists back and forth where the wire inters the connector  (if I use it much I'll have to fix it to keep the wires from breaking). I bought them for just for backup, so I'll be keeping them, but I just wish they were better built!
1,Prints fairly well but its rather expensive considering its only a 0.5 kg roll and the color is NOT bronze, not even close...
1,The software installation instructions are contained in a readme file.  I get nothing but error messages when (attempting to) follow the instructions.  Windows 10 cannot decipher the Chinese characters in the driver installation folder name.  So I created a folder on my hard drive, copied the CD files into this folder, and renamed the driver installation folder by deleating the Chinese characters.  Now the driver installation .exe file would at least start.  However, when asked to select the file to install (there was only one choice) I keep getting an "installation failure" message with no indication of what that failure might be.
1,failed after only a couple of	minutes.
1,Not suitable for #12 wire or larger
1,I was unpleasantly surprised to see the Spotnails packaging label list in bold "304 Stainless Steel" when that important stainless steel information should have been in the description and the sales image. IMHO this borders on false advertising!		These are 304 - I was hoping for 316 stainless steel like the 2" Bostitch brand ordered together with these.		Anyone ordering stainless steel materials should be informed of the quality. A simple way to 'somewhat' determine the quality of stainless steel is to try and lift or roll the item from side to side with a powerful magnet. The lesser amount of iron, 316 for instance, the better for marine or severe environment service. 316 stainless steel is practically non-magnetic. The lower the number, as in 304, the more iron therefor the more it is attracted to a magnet. A powerful magnet will lift these bards easily as seen in my attached photo.		I purchased both 3/4" and 1" sizes, both appear to be 304 stainless steel as is properly labeled on their packaging, unfortunately nowhere was this information to be found on the Amazon site at the time I purchased 10/15/2015.		In addition these were ordered early in the day for 'Same Day' delivery as described at checkout. I received a confusing email that they were delayed while the Amazon site still showed 'before 9pm' same day! I could have driven across town and purchased from a brick and mortar shop but paid more on Amazon to save time on a time sensitive project! I called but the rep was unable to offer any solutions. Not the first time this has happened...		Slowly loosing my faith in Amazon Prime's advantages!!!
1,waste of money
1,These resistors were definitely not what I expected: Wire is extremely thin, I can see some breadboards not making adequate contact. They are so thin, you'll bend them and rip them off from their group when taking them in and out of the bag. Additionally, three of the bags had rusted resistors inside. Some others had an oily residue. Not the best quality.		I'm giving it two stars just because there is a good amount of resistors, value range is great and price is not bad at all.
1,Okay, let me start by saying that the H681 is a sound piece of equipment.  The volume is great and the sound quality is pretty good and I've put several hours on the thing without incident (technologically speaking).  The power switch is also easily accessible while wearing this and the volume controls (though they initially felt backwards to me) are easy to access and press simultaneously for call waiting.		However.		The usability for this headset is completely DESTROYED by the fact that there is no way to swivel the piece to point toward (or at least parallel to) your cheek.  So unless it fits you perfectly from go, you are going to have problems.  Not only will you look like a d-bag for wearing one of these things in most contexts, but you will look like a COMPLETE TOOL because the thing wanders away from your face and sticks out away from your head!  It looks totally ridiculous and is even more frustrating when you throw a pair of glasses or sunglasses into the equation.  Look forward to pushing this thing back toward your head every time you want to make a call.		The simple fact is, instead of making a somewhat adjustable piece to go over the ear, they made it out of a solid straw of plastic.  And that, my friends, has compelled me to go buy one that is more adjustable.  It's a terrible waste, considering the quality of the headset otherwise seems very good.
1,DO NOT BUY	unless you enjoy peeling off a huge sticker on the front of the triangle. What on God's green earth motivates some idiots to put hard to remove stickers on their product? I bought (needed) four, and it took over twenty minutes to peel that garbage off. Retrospectively, I should have sent that c**p back.
1,MESSY AND DOESN'T HOLD UP
1,Did not fit 1/2 inch pvc pipe
1,Hard to beat for the price, they do all that they should and crimp well.  I would buy more without a second thought.		***UPDATE 02/2018***		I posted this a couple years ago, I just compared the new ones I just ordered to the old and WOW, nothing even close to the same size, gauge metal inside or quality.  These are just the cheapest China thing you can buy anyplace.  The reviews are all based on what the produce was not what it is and as such I'm dropping from 5 to 1 star.
1,Terrible products. Poor quality. Does not hold a zero, Does not read same measurement, either defective or poorly designed (probably both).
1,This filament operates over a vast temperature range (~17C - 205C) but strings on all of them. Very poor results overall.
1,Product was not 100% of what I expected.  I still need to put a lot of my strength to lift things up.
1,Not a very good super glue. I couldn't get it to stick. Should have stayed with Loctite.
1,Updated review...9/5/2016..... Sadly the stains I THOUGHT had been removed.... reappeared...  I gave 2 stars for the scrub brush.  Keeps you off your hands and knees... but the stain remover foam is worthless.  *dissappointed*
1,The new Brand III formulation has only 58% ethanol. This is under the 60% minimum recommended for hand sanitizers, so I wouldn't trust it in a surface disinfectant, either.
1,It does what it's suppose to. replaced clogged nozzles on my flashforge creator original. I can't compare the difference between the old nozzles to these since I bought the printer 2nd hand. But it solved my clogging and uneven filament problems.		UPDATE: After about 2 weeks, it's starting to clog frequently. It worked great at the beginning. Printing with the same roll of ABS on my old nozzles, which was printed better and lasted longer, even though it was old. Having to pull apart to clean/unclog after every print.		Changing to 1 star. Will have to look for better quality nozzles.
1,I purchased these bits via Amazon Prime from "Fargo Enterprises, Inc." (which was the seller for which this item was being offered with "Prime" eligibility at the time).  Based on the glowing reviews, I thought I was going to get a great set of bits.		What was sent to me was a bunch of cheap, poorly constructed bits--three of which had heads that were BENT upon receipt (needle-nosed bits) and BROKE when I tried to (very gingerly) bend them back to shape.  The rest of the set has been equally disappointing in performance.  They quickly overheat (with the grit melting off), break and lose their grit with little applied pressure, etc.  At $6 and change, I feel what I received was still a complete waste of money.		I do want to stress that the company I purchased the item from was this FARGO ENTERPRISES, INC.  However, I am rating the PRODUCT because it is the quality of the product that I had issues with--NOT THE SERVICE of the company from which I purchased it.  I suspect, based on the preponderance of positive reviews here, this company was simply offering an inferior product, but SINCE IT WAS FULFILLED THROUGH AMAZON VIA THEIR "PRIME" PROGRAM, who knows?
1,Tape is tape only as long as it sticks, using my precision digitally controlled hot air rework station and at 300 degrees (the lowest I tested it) it lost all adhesiveness.
1,Got it for Christmas, it was on sale. The first printer broke about 36 days after we got it. The SD card slot stopped reading and even though there's a plug to plug it into the computer to print directly from the computer - it doesn't work. You NEED the SD card slot to work.		So, Amazon begrudgingly made a very super special exception and let me exchange it. Aside from the warming plate not getting even a little bit warm, and models not sticking, sliding all over, it worked well enough. This one lasted about 2 months before it wouldn't even turn on anymore. All of a sudden the power switch stopped working. So rather than go through Amazon because they made it such a hassle to get help the first time I talked to monoprice directly. I had to ship it back to them, have them repair it, send it back. The whole process took about a month.		I got it back today. They said the wiring in the warming plate was faulty and they replaced it. Now I'm trying to print and everything I print feels like it's glued down. I can't get anything off of the plate. Which wouldn't be SO bad if it was printing correctly. But it's not. It starts to print normally then shifts every model over about an inch. So, every single thing I print is completely useless.		Talking to amazon customer service now. They're blaming me. Saying this is the second time there has been an issue. and want to give me a refund on the sale price. Refusing to exchange it for a working one. Nice. So now I'm out a printer and I spent a bunch of money on all this filament.		This printer is garbage and so is Amazon's customer service. The last 3 times I spoke with (on chat or email, phone has been fine) them they've been rude, unhelpful, and accusatory. I have no idea what happened to their customer service but it's terrible. I may stick around for smaller things but any big purchases like this are going to have to start being made elsewhere. There's no guarantee of anything working and if it doesn't they tell you it's your fault. Ridiculous. The pictures speak for themselves. You're right Amazon. Clearly this is MY fault... The printer works "fine", right?		Stay away from this printer.
1,Pipe arrived too short, dented, heavily oxidized and out of round. Overpriced peice of shop floor scrap.
1,you get what you pay for
1,I'm unhappy with both the product and the seller. Don't let the "Low VOC" tag fool you. The product is extremely toxic. The vapors can be fatal. It causes cancer, genetic defects, and irreversible neurological damage. It can't be thrown in the trash because it's extremely toxic to aquatic life, and doesn't break down. It's for professional use only. The seller includes two hypodermic needles. Given the toxic nature of this product, I think the hypodermic needles are a very bad idea. Shipping was not particularly fast, and the can arrived dented.
1,Updated my review. Stopped working after two weeks. Stay away.
1,giving up on this PETG filament.  I understand PETG will always string but this filament strings a lot more than my other PETG filaments..  it's a decent filament if you're printing vase or stuff where there aren't too much retractions
1,This stuff really sticks, especially to your fingers and itself. As	for anything else: maybe-maybe not. The most frustrating thing	about this brand is that it doesn't tear clean and always leaves	a stringer that peals back on the roll. This is pretty much for the	know-nothings that heard a name so they get this. You are far	better off with something like 3M of some other generic at the	hardware stores. This junk is just not worth the frustration!
1,EDIT:  Changing this from one star to 3, I liked it before and might like it again but I cant count on it due to ESUN changing the filament blend and not color matching previous parts and objects made with an earlier batch.  I will be changing brands for my go to cheap strong filament, might still buy ESUN for some things but knowing one spool to another of the same color may not match exactly I can't buy it regularly expecting consistency.  Single spool runs of objects and parts I know will not need to be reprinted later only.
1,My brother received one of these for his birthday and nearly had to go to the ER as he had a violent allergic reaction to it!  This was even before trying to print anything, just as he was trying to assemble the parts that he started having a reaction.  As a result, he had his son come and take it away as apparently the son has had no reaction so far... but I have advised him to be sure and use it in a ventilated area once he starts printing.  Research shows a variety of substances are released as the printing process commences and not all of them good!  Remember that these are low melting point plastics and just about any plastic can outgas when melted (or even before being melted in my brother's case I think).  I believe my brother's reaction occurred due to the outgassing of one of the plastic rolls included with the unit.  Luckily, the unit was removed in time for my brother to make a full recovery after visiting the MD and getting a shot of steroids to lessen the swelling in his hands.		UPDATE 3/21/18:  Still no working unit after over a year.  My nephew tried to assemble this, I tried to assemble it, and then a friend of my nephew's tried to assemble it.  Because the instructions are so haphazard and vague, it is over a year and still no working printer... total waste of money.  Now they sit there with a pile of metal and plastic scrap.  Is there anywhere to send it where it would get properly assembled and at what cost?  Might make an enormous difference in this review.
1,I ordered this for the 22 gauge wire. I don't recall seeing any sort of tester in the box. And I was seriously disappointed in the amount of wire when I saw the small spools.
1,I have pretty hard water where I live & I tend to get a build-up in the toilet below the water line. The stuff from the market does clean it fairly well but	I thought this "Commercial" cleaner would do a better job. I was hoping for less scrubbing & scraping with the pumice block and/or longer lasting results. Well, this stuff didn't do ANYTHING at all. Any ordinary bowl cleaner is better. I wasted my money.
1,Get your tools out and get ready to fix stuff all the time. I have 3 of these printers, and my boss has one also. we all had to perform the same mod on our machines to get them to reliably feed filament. The hot end on one of mine went out and the fitting that holds the bowden cable broke on another. I am constantly making repairs on these things so just beware. Oh and don't even think about trying to get help from XYZ they are completely useless in terms of support.
1,Doesn't feed properly on Fusion3 F-400.
1,Very disappointed in the specifications of the belt.  Received the belt and it looked a little slim.  I measured it with calipers and it is not a 6mm belt but more like 5.6mm.
1,bluck
1,These slings are NOT as pictured. They have full-width eyes and NOT folded eyes as pictured, to make attachment easier in shackles and other connecting links.
1,Garbage, NOT accurate
1,This item was bought to promote a contact between the skin and a heart rate watch from SwimOutlet who advertised that a good contact was necessary. Tried the watch with and without the contact gel. Neither worked. I doubt it was the fault of the gel. I thought it was the fault of the watch, and sent it back and received a credit. I wanted a heart rate meter because I was under great workload in physical therapy.
1,I would not recommend, co,pared to other manufacturer PLA's and other Hatchbox PLA's I've had issues with the blue PLA no matter what i did with it. Prints look great but the strength has been extremely brittle.
1,Too small to do much with.
1,Two of these bearings scored the rods I had them on.  One of them had ball bearings fall out of it when I inserted the rod.  I am using them on a 3d printer, and although they get the job done, I don't think they move smoothly enough.  I won't buy them again.
1,Last year, I purchased a #2-plain General grommet-repair kit from Amazon to compare it with the equivalent Lord & Hodge kits.  The contrast was remarkable!  The Lord & Hodge sets were domestically-manufactured and met all of my expectations.  The General set, in contrast, was cobbled together in India and was garbage.  A couple of the grommets were pitted on the margins, and one of the male components was bent.  Two more set imperfectly and had to be removed, a problem which I haven't encountered elsewhere.  I finally got around to weighing the respective grommets and found the General submission to be roughly 30% underweight.  Brass foil.  Although the first commentaries could be considered somewhat subjective, the weight differential isn't.  Additionally, I strongly suspect the setting tools are inferior to L&H's, a rough brinell test having indicated that the anvil material is softer.
1,Unusable filament		The first 2 prints I ran failed in minutes. The next small print I ran at 20mm/s (half the speed I run my other filaments at) was successful and I would have been fine if the only drawback was just having to print everything at half speed, but then the next print failed and I couldn't get anything to come out of my extruder after that, even at 230c. At first glance, the spool just looked like it was badly wound, but with a closer look, I can see bits of junk mixed in with the filament and the diameter varies wildly. I don't see how the spools I normally print have been tangle & junk-free in the dozens of spools I've used up, yet this for $2 less can't go 5 meters without a jam.		This picture shows the bits of junk and bulges from just one section of the spool.
1,Take a look at that image of the Brix/O.G. scales in the product description above.  Then plug some numbers into any online Brix-to-O.G. calculator.  Like this one:	http://www.brewersfriend.com/brix-converter/		What you see in your calculation will not come even close to what lines up on the refractometer's scale.  For example, 20 Brix converts to an O.G. of 1.083.  But the scale on the refractometer shows about 1.077.  A value of 30 Brix should be 1.129, but is shown as 1.117.  The higher the gravity, the more the two scales diverge.		So the question is this: Is just one scale off calibration, or both?  Your guess is as good as mine.
1,Not worth the money. I purchased one of these because today's plastic cans take forever to empty. I wanted something easy to use and fast, but safe.  The lever that you have to squeeze to get the fuel to flow out is a pain to deal with. You must have a strong forearm just to keep the fuel flowing. If you ne to pour fuel at or above your head (boat), you will likely pour gas all over yourself (through the safety release valve).  I only purchased one due to price. If I liked it, I planned to replace my other 3 plastic gas cans.  That isn't going to happen.
1,This PLA is only 1.65mm diameter.  It has a very strange texture, really rough.  I'm used to using Hatchbox PLA, but they were sold out, so I bought this instead.  My test print with it turned out awful.  I do not believe that this PLA is any good.  I am going to try to return in to the seller.
1,This stuff is terrible. Only seems to cure *IN* the dispense tube. Made a huge mess in many places where the yellow spewage only hardened on the surface - the space behind was just partially full of sticky goo that never cured. "Re-using" the can is a nightmare as the nozzle clogs hopelessly and repeatedly, even with cleaned with Acetone, pokers, and compressed air. This is basically a "one shot and and hope it works" kind of product. It does say "single use" on the can...and they are not kidding. This doesn't work like a can of spray paint.		I've used one entire can and have sealed exactly *ZERO* gaps, despite having to clean up 12 sticky messes after all the re-trys.		And yes, I've shaken the can twelve billion times. James Bond would be proud.		Find some other way. This stuff SUCKS.		FOUND IT ==> Buy the Locitite "Tite Foam" product (also on Amazon) instead. SOOOO much better. Worked beautifully on the first try, nozzle straw is bigger and transparent so you can actually see where it is clogged. The Great Stuff can has a tiny diameter, completely opaque straw that is super difficult to clean out if you want to try to make a second run.
1,Sad !
1,This wheel claims to have a 1200 lb rating, but as soon as I began to move a trailer, with the wheel on a smooth board on level ground, the rivet that holds the cylinder to the wheel frame (and allows rotation) bent and the wheel began to collapse.		Very poorly made and not adequate for a normal 600 lb tongue weight.
1,this is way too brittle falls apart even if you are gentle with it.
1,Total junk. We ordered 8 for a class, and neither the kids nor teachers could hear a heartbeat with ANY of them.  The plastic heads warped immediately, too - rendering them useless.  This is where you really should spend money on a REAL stethoscope.
1,Not really gaffer's tape, cheap imitation. Stick with the other name brands. This leaves residue on whatever you stick it to. And it's not a cloth tape like the real stuff, it's more like a vinyl tape of some sort.
1,Uncomfortable, synthetic latex or chemical blisteted my nose. TOOK two weeks and visit to ENT to clear up.  Feels like sandpaper and unbreathable.
1,I received this unit about 6 months ago as a gift and used several times since then.		I found the meter readings to be highly variable with poor repeatability. I would take several readings one after another and would get differences of up to 0.4. Sometimes readings would be wildly off. I found that I needed to recalibrate in between every reading, even with a time lapse of just a few minutes.		Recalibration is an awkward task. The display is on the front of the meter, the switch is on the top and the tiny calibration screw is on the rear. Since the switch is spring loaded, i.e. you have to slide and hold to get a reading, the calibration becomes a 3 handed effort.		I never had any confidence in the readings I got from this meter and it quit working after 6 months.		I cannot recommend this meter and will be looking for something different for my needs (measuring mash pH).
1,The locking interferes with regular usage (you start pressing against the locking mechanism instead of the object as the tips flex).		Also, there's a sharp point that pokes through a hole in the opposite limb. Every time you accidentally engage the lock (see above), the point will stab you right in the pad of your thumb. I don't get it, it's like it was designed to stab you.
1,Trash. Sprinkle a little water on these things and it'll stop working instantly. Had to buy three more just because of that issue. Needs to be water proof
1,The plastic smells absolutely awful.
1,My offices required us to get several converter boxes, and this is by far he worst of them. It lacks even the most basic features such as a volume control for the television. If you buy this box, you'll need two remotes to control the volume and channels on your TV unless you have a universal remote that will actually work with it. The box itself can't function without the remote either. You can't even turn it on and off without the remote because the box has zero controls on it. It's performance is fair at best too. This box is so poor, we replaced it with the Tivax STB-T8, which has more features, costs less, and performs better. We also have several Zenith DTT901's, which also performs circles around this hunk of junk. I rarely give an item 1 star, but this box deserves it.
1,My batch was extremely bad, inconsistent density a lot of bubbles), brittle (breaks much easier than any other PLA filament I have used. I haven't had any luck using it, it is in the dumpster now.
1,This vacuum (for the unit I received, anyway) should never have left the test table at Bissell.  When it is started, the belt is misaligned so badly between the motor that drives it and the beater bar that the belt shreds, as it pushed its way to the end of the beater bar.  After about 10 minutes of use, the plastic floor guard that internally houses the belt guides inside, breaks where the belt relentless pushes on it, while shredding itself to death.		This vacuum cleaner that I received is an epic fail by Bissell's design and/or manufacturing dept, and a certain fail by the apparently non-existent testing process that should be occurring wherever these units are made.		Bissell rep, please explain to me how such a poor unit can be sold to the public, if you are good enough to respond to my review here, thanks.
1,Waste of money will never order any more plastic fittings, going to stick to metal ductwork and ground everything good.
1,Disappointed with the lack of adhesion. Was trying to cover a few wasp holes in the bare wood frame that I made for grape vines. Sure I could have used many different substitutes to fill/cover the holes, but I thought that this brand would at least keep the peskie yellow jackets out of the holes until I acquired something better. The wood frame is bare, dry and smooth and thought that it would be good enough to attach a few pieces of the tape over the offending holes. But within a few seconds the tape started to curl at the edges and although it did not fall off altogether, it simply made for an open door for the annoying intruders.
1,This garage door seal is a pain in the neck to install.		First off, the instructions are not detailed enough. It seems like it should be simple, but they don't give any guidance on the recommended offset from the door to make the best seal. On the first attempt at lining it up and putting in the first nail, it seemed too tight so I pulled the nail and backed it off a little. That seemed better at first, but after a few nails, I had gaps in some areas, either at the garage door side or the trim side.		Hammering in the nails above your head wears out your arms a lot faster than one would think, and it's really hard to hammer the nails in straight since the door and/or trim are in the way, especially in the corners. But that's not the worst of it. After I got 3 nails in, I could already tell that there were going to be issues because there were some wrinkles along the nail line where I must have strayed ever-so-slightly off a straight line. Trying to correct it on the next nail was an exercise in futility and only seemed to make it worse.		The instructions say to cut the top strip to the width of the top of the garage door. I did that, and came up 1 inch short, likely because it was stretched along its length during fitting, then was not stretched as much during installation. That corner left a huge unsealed gap and there was no way to fix it without.		After installing the top and part of one side, I decided to just rip it down. I'll have to find something else.		- It's not easy hammering in nails overhead, and I had to take several breaks. Maybe a staple gun would work better, although I'm not sure how well they would stand up to seasonal changes compared to the roofing nails that come with the garage door seal.	- Inadequate instructions	- It's impossible to keep it aligned perfectly straight while nailing, which then causes wrinkles/gaps	- Transferring dimensions directly from the top of the garage door onto the seal caused the measurement to come up short and leave a large gap		Installation tips if you do want to waste your money and time on this:	- Instead of the supplied nails, use screws and washers, or staples	- Cut the top a few inches long prior to installation, then trim it to length when you are working on the last nail/staple	- Have a helper on hand to hold it in place
1,I bought this after reading all the amazing reviews. I was really disappointed because this seemed like a great combination and balance between features and price. I didn't want to settle for the more basic 20 dollar tools or go for Fluke 200 dollar meters just to be able to test for small parasitic losses in automotive applications.		Well no matter what I would try, no matter what device or load or anything it never reads A/C current. When I switch it to DC which is the main reason I bought it for, it wonders quite a lot. If I do get it to stay close to zero it might sometimes go up to .020 amps when testing a load which I know is more, and then remain there when I remove the wire being tested. About the only thing I've gotten it to actually work on is testing the entire amperage draw of the vehicle when doing 10-30 amps. Other than that it's nearly useless. I don't know if I got a defective unit but I've tried this on everything and every setting before giving up having to buy a more expensive GTC unit. Also I suspect that UNI-T does shady marketing because I keep seeing spam for this model in every other online discussion about clamp on meters that I run across, which makes me wonder how many reviews on here are legit.
1,Worked on three cable tests then quit.
1,straight out of the bag and have had nothing but water bubbles in prints ever since.  thinking it was something else until i looked at the filiment still in the head...BUBBLES!!! bubbles everyplace...
1,Terrible for "PROFESSIONAL" use.	I run a business dismantling motorcycles. We use spray bottles for cleaning, usually just filled with degreaser.	These feel fine and pump fine, but two of the three broke in the first week of use. The top of the clear bottle just cracked right off or split so you can't use them. They are worse durability than the el cheapo dollar store ones.	We bought https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z86FRPO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1	at the same time and none have broken. They're much better.
1,This sheet is undersize. Someone else mentioned this, too. Mine are 1/4" and 3/16" shy of being 12" square. Unfortunately I *do* need the full 12", so this isn't going to work well.		If people have a hard time with their cutting tolerances, they should make sure they err on the large side instead of shafting people.
1,This stuff sticks all into the threads and gets torn up into tons of little pieces, so if you ever unscrew the fittings you applied it to, it's nearly impossible to remove properly.  When you then screw things back together, perhaps with new tape on the male end which is easier to clean, the tiny pieces all get pushed out of the much harder to clear female end and foul the gas line, potentially damaging whatever appliances you have connected or clogging a filter at best.  I had a propane distribution arrangement constructed of several T's and such, and when I needed to remove one fitting for a change, this fact forced me to deconstruct the entire arrangement so that I could effectively get all the little bits and pieces out of the fittings.  What a pain!  I wasn't about to do that again, so this hit the trash and I picked up some liquid PTFE thread seal, which works MUCH better.  Not only do I not worry about contaminating the gas line now, but the liquid sealant helps lubricate the fittings making it possible/easier to tighten them down further.  Search YouTube for a comparison of PTFE tape versus liquid to see others in agreement before you buy this!
1,As others have stated, the sheet I received was warped. Thinking that it would be fine once I glued it to the hotbed I was wrong. It caused the bed to warp so leveling was impossible. Others have reported that the received a flat sheet, but it like rolling the dice when you order. Look elsewhere..
1,Hotend was burnt and has dried filiment all over it. Gantry is bent. The bed has a huge scratch where the nozzle dug into it. It was missing sample pla as well as SD card.
1,The new Brand III formulation has only 58% ethanol. This is under the 60% minimum recommended for hand sanitizers, so I wouldn't trust it in a surface disinfectant, either.
1,OK, this product printed quality is fine as most of the 3D solutech is.  However the color is nothing like "gold"  I expected a brighter, more shinier color.  If you are looking for a reflective metallic effect, this is not the product to do that.  It is very dull in color and can serve as a base color if you want to just sand and paint with a metallic gold paint.  This is more of an antique "old" gold color.  Printing is fine just not what I expected for color.
1,Works about as well as as heating up the nozzle to 240 and pushing through any normal filament.
1,Printed out shoulder armor for a Keyleth cosplay.  The material was very hard to stick to the surface of my MP ultimate.  I bought this to save money instead of getting hatchbox, and I was mistaken.  After troubleshooting, I did find that I needed to lower the speed which this was the only filament I had to.  However once fully printed, the shoulder armor was less detailed than I had hoped, compared to other prints.  I will spend the extra bit for the hatchbox black filament.
1,I just bought one identical from Walmart, under the name (12" Schwinn Roadster Trike Red)  price $74.97 + Sales Tax:  $ 4.20  Order Total:  $ 79.17, free delivery pick up in the store. The seller in Amazon has overpriced $18.98 compared with Walmart.	My Grandchild 32 months old 39lb at 38"high has 2 bikes:	1 - Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red	2 - 12" Schwinn Roadster Trike,	He is using both under my supervision, so that's my Opinions:	Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red	Pros: Solid Built, almost immune to the corrosion, very good torque to the Active Wheel 9"diameter vs. 2.4" length of pedal arm.	This provides a smooth pedaling, and easier to go up heel, and control going up through inclined sidewalks.	Cons: The center of gravity isn't to low, and combined with "The pedal always free spin backward regardless of the locking position" makes it impossible for the kid to control the speed, using pedals, to slow down, going down through inclined sidewalks. This bike has no brakes, and pedals are the only defense for the kid. So this is a very serious safety flaw.	12" Schwinn Roadster Trike.	Pros:	Solid, built, with very low center of the gravity, no free spin pedals, and wide range of the sit adjustments.	Cons:	This Trike is prone of corrosion if it is wet, or kept in humidity higher then 60% for long time.	With active wheel 12" diameter, vs. 2" length of pedal arm, this has 50% torque compared with, Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike.	This makes hard to pedal on the grass, up heels, and for long rides creates a lot of stress to the kid's legs, unless the surface is strong, flat and HORIZONTAL. Any time we go for a Ride, after 50 feet trip, mu grand son stops, turns around, go back to the home, drops the (12" Schwinn Roadster Trike), picks up the (Radio Flyer 4-in-1 Trike, Red) and enjoy the ride. Why: because 12" Schwinn Roadster Trike creates too much stress on his legs.	This nice bike is a bike For Show but not To Go.
1,$17 per 500 box?  Overpriced!
1,Won't stick to metal bicycle parts!
1,Thermocouple screw is only on one side so you will need to put one in upside down unless you get an opposite one in the pack. I got 1 right and 4 lefts.
1,Looks OK if I don't look  too closely. The head leaks all over. This is not an Omron stethoscope. It is a non-functioning counterfeit.
1,They load you up on small to extra extra tiny tubes. not enough tubes for wire sizes used in the real world.. Tossed 1/2 the tubes trash. they were useless. Ive never seem wires so small with shrink wrap on them..
1,Fairly low quality ubfortunately but depending on your application the width could be useful.
1,This pump turned out to be noisy, and id didn't work right.  I called Shurflo, they said it wasn't really the best fit for an RV, and they offered to send me a replacement membrane kit, that they said would make it work better.  I just sent the pump back and bought the "Shurflo 4008-101-E65" right here on amazon.  It is much, much better for RV use.
1,The conection in the multimeter amprobe or fluke is very weak . I think the inside of male conector was not good built.. The alligators are good for  my job . I did this , I inserted a very tiny screwdriver into the male conector and twisted carefully each segment of the conector  until you can see something like  "flower ", with this you can connect inside of female conector inside of your multimeter and you feel more tight it . I think this is not  full quality process by AMPROBE ,the point  of  conection, , ... This is the most important funtion of any  leads... the  reliable  function......Like a customer , nobody  must change or fix the a item purchased with  good control quality
1,Threw them out. Completely useless. Hooks fall out when you lift the tool of the hook. The little plastic ties that supposedly hold the hooks fall out, break, and simply do not hold the hooks tightly.	Buy the hooks that have two insertions on the hook itself. They are a little harder to attach to the pegboard,  but are firm and stay in place with no movement or wobble. I found that by "stretching" the bottom peg board hole makes it much easier to insert.	 Just insert one of the hook retainers in the bottom hole  and wiggle it a bit too enlarge the hole some.
1,The tap went in 5 turns into a brass fitting and it snapped. I was simply trying to clean threads and using much pressure at all. The only garbage in the threads was old pipe dope.
1,This thing fell apart just from looking at it and the glass broke. I never had a chance to use it.
1,Before you read further, let me warn you.  XYZ uses garbage heating elements.  The heating element in the extruder will go bad no matter which one you use, it's just a wearable component but the ones XYZ uses (and the replacements they send) do not last more then 2-3 days.  Normally you should get 6 months to a year out of this part, 2 years if you are not using this thing heavily.  So, tape an allen key to the side of your printer because you're going to be changing heating elements a lot!		XYZ's facebook page is pretty great.  They responded on facebook within minutes, providing tips and links to tutorials that others have found helpful.		The printer itself looks really professional.  It's the first "finished" looking 3d printer that I've seen that has a usable build area.  The 7.8" build area is massive compared to other printers triple the price of this one.  You're getting a printer that prints better models than the $1500 models and looks better as well!  It comes pre-calibrated but the novice user will still have to overcome a learning curve.  Shapes made in sketchup or similar software do not always transfer cleanly through the XYZ ware, so make sure you preview the post-slice rendering before you allow it to print.		My first few prints were disastrous but once I had a thin layer of dried glue and leftover plastic on the base, they got better.  I've had a lot more luck leaving the glass plate "dirty" than when it is perfectly clean and smooth.  The printer comes with a glue stick, you should apply a thin coat and let it dry before printing.  The plastic sticks to the glue instead of the glass and your models are a lot easier to remove.  You're only going to get 1 or 2 good prints though before you're sent spiraling into calibration hell...  Anyone who's printed 2-3 objects will know what I'm talking about - and if they deny this, they're lying.  The vibrations from the pieces moving on the printer will knock the heated bed out of alignment and you'll spend hours turning the tiny wheels and testing calibration to try and get it back.  I don't know of any printer that has automated this process yet - but when someone does... please let me know!!!		The software tends to butcher 3d models, even shapes that the printer seems very capable of printing.  Once you get the trick of how the software will treat your models you do alright though.  Make sure you preview what the model changes into after being "sliced" before you confirm the print.		The resolution is okay.  It's not great.  It took me a bit to figure out how to adjust this.  The XYZ software seems really outdated and it's not very intuitive.  Just like any other thermal 3d printer, everything you print is going to be covered in lines from the layering.  You can adjust the settings to make slightly thinner layers but you have to do this every time you print.  They claim 100 micron resolution - and I just don't see it.  The best I've gotten, even using higher quality plastic than xyz offers, is 200 microns.		With stronger software, this printer would be really awesome.		That being said, it is absolutely the best printer for the money.  It prints at the same quality as other printers for about half the cost... but I just don't honestly think the technology is there yet for proper "home use."  You CANNOT just plug this thing in and print.  You need to learn the quirks and adjustments and perform lots and lots of maintenance on this thing.		There simply is not a home-use-ready 3d printer out there yet.  They all take a while to get used to and they will all give you "birds nests" until you get the hang of them... which is disappointing because you shouldn't need an engineering degree to operate a device that functions on technology from the 1970s!
1,they are missing a lot in quality. I am not happy with the selection either as you get a lot of small anchors and the few big ones they need more bite
1,Too small for extra large hands!
1,Wrong size hardware, ended up just ordering a whole new extruder.
1,Hello fellow Amazonians:	We purchased a number of these items based on the seemingly positive reviews it has. Unfortunately, they were constructed with poor quality materials and rather shoddily put together. I wish we had an option of not buying poorly made Chinese made products or products other countries who don't really have our interests in mind other than to sell thing to us. Unfortunately we'll be returning these items in search of a better quality product state side. Shame.
1,This filament doesn't print like PLA at all. It smells, and it shrinks when it cools down (the edges lift up). My prints came out far worse than when using other PLA.		On the upside the color is good.
1,PRO:		1.  Arrived on time.	2.  Works as advertised.	3.  Has dual language stickers.	4.  Bright red and two lock holes in case two people want to lock out at the same / different times.		CON:	1.  Plastic, let me say that again, it's PLASTIC!	2.  If using for SECURITY reasons, this can be broken off easy.	3.  Any padlock can be twisted and break this PLASTIC device off easy.	4.  It "binds" on itself when you try to use it.		OTHER:	1.  It's plastic.  So once this breaks by someone trying to steal water from me, I'll have to buy something better / stronger.	2.  Read reviews, this one got me, lesson learned.	3.  I would have paid more for a metal one.
1,The test tubes are nice  a bit larger than expected...that's a bonus.  I would have rated higher but several arrived broken
1,These terminals seem to be well made for the price, however they do not function well.		Once connected, the male and female "quick disconnects" are nearly impossible to pull apart. I had to use a vise and pliers to get them apart.		I ordered these with the intention of having something that I could quickly disconnect, but these do not fit the bill.		If you are only going to make a connection with these and do not plan to ever disconnect them, then I would say buy them. If you need to be able to pull them apart then get something else like a bullet connector.
1,I've used ABS, PLA, PLA+ and recently, PetG. I have the Inland Magenta PetG which prints flawlessly, yet this e-Sun white is killing me. I must have tried dozens of configurations and either it warps, moves off the glass plate ignoring the always reliable hairspray layer, or goes up on to the nozzle, causing a disaster. I've gotten one object to print  with this white PetG perfectly, and with the exact same settings, I printed the the same object minutes later, only to result in one of the aforementioned horrors. Life is too short to fiddle to death with this. Other e-Sun (PLA+/PLA) print without a hitch... this white needs an exorcist.
1,This filament is a very bad quality. I tried 3 different filaments from this brand and they all are very bad in every term. I used two other filaments in the past and they are both much better, not even comparable to this one. One good thing in this one, is that it does not smell bad as ABS usually does. But it makes me wonder whether it is ABS at all or not.		If you want an advice, I recommend Hatchbox filament, it prints beautifully, this filament is a junk, not a real ABS I believe, but some mixture. For those of you who will think I work for Hatchbox, no I am not, you can open my review profile and see how old it is and how many different reviews are in there and none of them are related to this niche :) I recommend Hatchbox sincerely, I only bought this one, because hatchbox was out of stock that week. I filed a return for this one and replaced with black ABS from hatchbox. By the way, SainSmart TPU is horrible quality. I had their PVA too, but can not really comment on it, because I had adhesion issues big time, but that may be related to my own error. I do not have much experience with PVA printing.
1,I use this set for woodturning and they do a good job.  My only gripe is that, for the money, the adjustment knobs are "cranky" and not very smooth, so it requires some fussing to set dimensions and take readings.  The more expensive versions are smoother and much easier to adjust.  Unless you are really in a budget crunch, spend more $$$ and get a better set... you will have less frustration.
1,Bought this unit to operate the chute on a 47" snowblower.  Just installed it today, Dec. 12.  It operated nicely for about 4 or 5 cycles.  Then it stopped working.  I went to return the item, to late.  The unit was purchased Oct. 22, had until Nov. 22 to return it..  Since I could not return/exchange it, I opened the end of the unit and found when it was assembled, one of the power wires was pinched resulting in the wire burning off.  This failure was without a doubt a manufacture fault.  Because it did not get put into service within 30 days of purchase, the failure of the manufacturer is now my problem.  SO, if you purchase one of these, put it in service as soon as you get it.
1,I can't see this pan lasting as long as the one I bought a year and a half ago.  The metal is much thinner, the coating appears thinner and the skillet won't sit level on my gas range because it is handle heavy.  T-fal used to be my "go-to" skillets.  The 8 inch one  gets used 2-3x a day.  I wish I wouldn't have tossed my old black one out so I could show you the difference.  The new one is cheap feeling and for a few more dollars, I should have bought a better brand, but didn't realize how low quality these had become.  Just glad I didn't buy the matching larger sizes. I do like the color and the cool grip handle or I wouldn't give this any stars.  Sorry..
1,Of the 10 bearings, 3 ran smoothly - 2 were torqued slightly causing them to not be perfectly flat and the remainder had scratched bearings causing noticeable vibration when spining.  Next time I'll pay attention and by ABEC speicification rated bearings.
1,This is the bar none worst out of the box printer I have ever used	It's cheap but there's a reason it's cheap	Leveling can be incredibly difficult my build plate was warped and the printer was so far out of whack it took me an entire day of printing test prints to get it right I will be returning this item extremely disappointed
1,This reagent bottle is very cheap and should NOT be used for dangerous chemicals.  On the other hand, it has an old apothecary look if you were making a nice display for something like a bathroom.  The glass has bubbles and the stopper really doesn't seal well.  If you need a real reagent bottle, you will have to pay for a Kimax or something like that.
1,New twist on traditional duct tape. Thick cross fibers need to be cut with  a sharp razor blade,so it cannot be torn like duct tape. On top of that the adhesive gums up the blade quickly, so for friggin get about using scissors on this stuff. Yes its strong but it is a huge pain to work with.
1,I love kreg and their products, but this is just an overpriced piece of paper. There is nothing special about it and is massively overpriced.
1,I haven't found this filament to be as brittle as some other transparent filaments unless it gets cold.  Transparency is very good and so far it hasn't had any knots when unwinding.  Here's more information on the clear filament and the brittleness problem. Only the last few inches of the spool become brittle and the easiest thing to do is to unload the filament and just break off the brittle part. The white PLA does this as well and it's easy enough to work around.		But I discovered a bigger problem when I reordered the clear PLA, they sent a different filament which was translucent and not transparent like the last spool (calling it "clear" is somewhat ambiguous). I kept it sealed so I could return it, but they told me it would be the same after it was heated. They were wrong, the package is now open because that's what they told me to do, and they aren't responding to my messages any more. It's too bad, the original clear was good but I don't trust the vendor and will take my business somewhere else. Be careful if you use "Shop 3D Supplies", maybe you'll get lucky, maybe you won't.
1,I should have done more research before using this with my pellet stove flue pipe. This tape didn't seal my flue pipe worth anything. The only good thing about it is that it comes off very easily without leaving residue after you realize its doesn't work. I used high temperature silicone sealant instead.
1,I used to be a pipefitter and Blue Monster teflon tape from Millrose is top shelf schtuff as far as teflon tape goes. But this marketer, Plumbers Outpost, will cost you 450% MORE than purchasing this same exact roll of Teflon next time you're at the big box hardware store that has a name 5 letters long, and looks like a blue box with a blue roof on top.
1,This is not low loss cable.  The transmit power was so degraded, that having the antenna gain was moot.  I also bought two of these so I know it was not just a bad cable.  If you are seriously looking to improve your signal strength, use a thicker, and shorter cable.
1,Supposedly all-rubber.  Material is hard and not very flexible.
1,I can't see this pan lasting as long as the one I bought a year and a half ago.  The metal is much thinner, the coating appears thinner and the skillet won't sit level on my gas range because it is handle heavy.  T-fal used to be my "go-to" skillets.  The 8 inch one  gets used 2-3x a day.  I wish I wouldn't have tossed my old black one out so I could show you the difference.  The new one is cheap feeling and for a few more dollars, I should have bought a better brand, but didn't realize how low quality these had become.  Just glad I didn't buy the matching larger sizes. I do like the color and the cool grip handle or I wouldn't give this any stars.  Sorry..
1,Cheep crap. Came apart the first time I used it. Fixed it with a hose clamp. Still in use though.
1,Well this is the second one of these that I bought. The first one worked very well until the wire broke (which was my fault). But, this one. I'm not to happy about. Opened the package and everything looked good so I installed it right away and set my settings in Marlin as from what RepRapchampions.com said. Go to do a PID tune for 240c and the little bit of black epoxy that is on the end looked like it melted and came off. Now I can't even get it to PID tune for 200c. Very dissatisfied this time around.
1,wrong size
1,It feels slimy and cleanup was messy.
1,Tip bends easily so it does not hold small stuff .
1,I bought two. They were both Way off in regards to humidity. With semi-calibrated equipment I knew the room was about 68% humidity, but both units read 40% & 41% respectively. I ordered these two units a week apart, so I doubt they were "next" to each other during assembly. Amazon DOES NOT honor returns unless you write them and ask really really nice. That was a first for me after ten years of being a prime member.
1,This filament is out of spec with some areas at 1.9mm and has jammed in two distinct printers.	In both cases it was necessary to bring the printer up to 225 degrees to clear the jam.	Worse yet, this vendor is playing the Amazon ratings game by paying for good reviews with a free roll of filament.
1,This didn't do the job for me. I used it to try to cover a couple of old cables, but the stuff just cracks off once it dries, if you try to flex it at all. Move along.
1,Not sure what I expected but this epoxy is kind of impossible to work with. It took 18hrs till it was not longer tacky and continued to slowly run the entire time. I followed all the directions for the proportions. It is not something you can undo either sanding it doesn't really fix the globs because it is so high gloss. lost several prints. Might be a bad batch I know the box looked like it was hit by a truck but other than that kit seemed fine. IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE 90% OF FINISH WORK LIKE IT CLAIMS. you are far better off increasing your perimeter layers and getting a good rubber sand paper product. much better every time. might work to seal your flat surfaces. DO NOT TRY TO SAND THIS STUFF!!!!!
1,Difficult to separate backing tape from reflective tape.  Not reflective in dark.
1,I was encouraged when I received this toothbrush.  Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.		My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife's mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a "clean" mode and a "sensitive" mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.		Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.		The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.		Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars.
1,Vulkem brand not sold at local big box store.  I used this to seal around my vinyl window after initial installer's silicone caulk peeled.  I got a fresh tube and the sealant flowed out easily.  I used a battery powered caulk gun so I can't tell how much pressure is needed if using a manual caulk gun.  I know the label recommended using soapy water to smooth out the sealant but I used WD40 instead and it came out smooth.  Only time will tell if this holds up.		Update (1/2017):  During a rainy spell, window frame started leaking inside at the top of both ends.  Went out to look and this sealant had shrunk and peeled off the window at both ends.  This was caulked no less than a year ago.  I guess I'll go back to using 100% Silicone for windows from now on.  The time, expense and incurring water damage from using this product is very disappointing to say the least.  Not recommended for windows or any smooth surfaces due to adhesion problems!
1,Works great up until it doesn't.  The first month I had mine, everything was fine but then it started to jam.  After taking apart and reassembling, everything just started falling apart - If just barely touching the fan broke it ($15 + 1 week) the heatbrake snapped off in the heat block ($18 + $5 shipping + 1 week) and the broken brake could not be removed from the heat block ($18 + $5 for shipping + 1 week),  the thermister wire broke ($5 + $5 shipping)(where the wire leaves the glass bead) and just trying to keep the thing running after a little usage has turned into a nightmare.
1,Are usually only buy 3D Solutech but this has been the worst roll of filament Ive ever used. The quality is good the prints come out fine if you watch and untangle it every 20 minutes. Its kind a like the filament is super twisted and all it wants to do is Come off the roll or get tangled up.
1,Very poor quality. Mirror edges chipped. Not well finished at all. Look elsewhere.
1,Wanted to much to like this because of the huge print area.  But after 2 weeks trying to get the calibration right and several posts on their help form I still haven't been able to get it to do a quality print.  The firmware was riddled with bugs and the calibration for it was more miss than hit.  If there was a little better out of box support for setup and had I been able to get even 1 decent print I'd say this is a 5 star based off price and size.  But at this point I couldn't recommend it
1,I probably own a half dozen or more 6" calipers similar to this one, but none of them have both a fractional scale and a decimal scale right on the dial, both of which I need in my woodworking shop. I'm fairly careful with all my tools so I was surprised when it just quit working after only a years use in my shop. Since I was beyond Amazons return period, I made several attempts to contact Hartville tool, who were distributing this item at the time, to see if they would replace this item, with no response. I think I'm going to try the combination caliper that Lee Valley tool sells next, since I can always rely on them selling only quality tools and I prefer the decimal scale to be on the outer rim of the dial, which this one isn't. It makes for a more accurate read.
1,Screen is extremely difficult to read. Micro-switch (on/off) works poorly. No blue clips provided for quick connects
1,Quality of prints is okay but it is very frustrating to use as there are random breaks in the filament.  In other words, if you don't watch carefully, your printer will get to a spot where the filament is broken continue on as if nothing is wrong.  I wondered if it was the printer so I unspooled several feet and sure enough, I get to a spot that it is broken.  This is the only spool I have ever had with this situation.
1,Boy I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this!  This is *not* cloth gaff tape.  It acts like not very sticky cold duct tape.  I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I'll use it as a door stop or something.  I will not buy again.
1,Its been good so far but the filament was cut halfway through which luckily ran out after the print was done, if that had been a larger print it would have ruined it.		update: we'll it finally ruined a print, a long print, heres a picture of where they made the spool so that it formed a knot that ultimately caused the filament to snap out of the extruder from being grounded down on for so long. Filament is great, QC is what you would expect of the chinese.
1,As of 2018 Inland has declined in quality. Before 2018 all my rolls were amazing, bought from both Amazon and Microcenter. Now, buying from both Microcenter and Amazon the rolls just aren't what they use to be. I'm no longer a lover of Inland. This makes me so sad. Now it will cost me more to get quality prints.
1,It does not work as described.
1,This unit was awesome for the first 10 months or so. Now every so often the toothbrush turns on by itself, or the button won't work without a struggle. It is annoying hearing it kick on randomly, and have to go turn it off. The machine works fine! It is the tooth brush that causes trouble. If there is a model without the brush, I would get that - and then get a sonicare for your brush.
1,I love the slots for holding the bag in place. Nice purchase; just wish the lid for this didn't cost more than the can (from most sellers), itself. two stars removed for that "bait and switch" type marketing disgrace.
1,Don't use on anything except Audio.
1,Cheapest bit of trash. Paper thin with zero rigidity. Totally unable to stand on its own without being glued to something else. Even more comedic was the no peal UPC sticker adhered to the front corner of each sign-over another UPC sticker. Anyone with a third grade education would have known to apply it to the back if at all. Totally worthless to anyone.
1,I tried to like this center. I really did. It's big, it feels substantial, and it's exactly what I'm looking for. The first one felt like it had positive stops every quater of a turn. I figure in any production line there will be duds, so I had Amazon send me another one (thank goodness for Amazon's easy return system). The second one is better, but I can still feel the bearings grind when I turn it. Hooked up to the lathe, at slow speeds, it feels and sounds like a pepper mill grinding pepper- not the smooth, quiet live center I was expecting. Still hopefull, I called PSI directly, figuring they would find me a good one and send it to me, I don't doubt all the other reviewer have good ones, I'm just seeing some poor QC up the chain. Anyway, I could hear the technician's superviser talking to him in the background, and he basically said that's how it's supposed to run. Maybe it will get better with time, he tells me. He said if I wanted a quiet, smoother center I should look into their more expensive package (~$80). I was pretty surprised since they advertise it as a "smooth running" center.		Oh well, the replacement is headed back to Amazon. If you want to risk it, just make sure you don't tear up the package it came in so you can return it if you need to. Off to find another cone shaped center...
1,worst pan I have ever used, Eggs stuck to the pan like Glue
1,I bought two of these to compare humidity in two apartments. I thought I would sit them together so I could callibrate any differences. See the photo for how they are right out of the box.		Probably just a case of one bad unit, but that doesn't help me today, when I was counting on using them. And, I don't even really know which one to send back, or if the one that's more likely right is close to actually being right.
1,Don't waist money.  Picture is unreadable.
1,of the three most popular filament brands sold on amazon, solutech, matchbox, and e-sun, this one was in last place from my testings of it. as i saw that many high reviews between these 3 brands i didn't know which to buy so i bought 1 in each. first off i like to say that i might be a little bias to petg, everyone seem to think it is much stronger than pla, i don't feel that to be the case, but it is more flexible which is why it can i think be view as a stronger material. it downsize being more subseptable to stringing, can't paint it, and almost all glue will not work on it. if you want to know what this material is like pick up a bottle of water from your store and that is basically it.	anyway on with it for my usage of petg, i find hatchbox to be the highest running temp, 240-250c, which would result as more stringiness than the other two especially in complicated build. for petg i found that esun perform better even at 220c and excellent strenght up to 235c. but the shocking result was solutech, mainly because it was not as good as esun but perform better than hatchbox. it ran at lower temp as esun with similar strength, but cost only 17.99 vs hatchbox 29.99 and esun 24.99. downside is amazon doesnt carry many solutech in petg so color is limited.	so if you looking at petg for the first time like i was and don't want to buy all three to test, try solutech, or esun, and then try  this you be surprise how the cost doesnt equal quality in this case, or maybe solutech is just coming on strong so they lower their cost to capture an audience, who knows but its made in USA too. also i heard different printer works differently on types/brands of filament, so for this i only had three printers that i tested on Prusa MK2s, Monoprice maker select plus and mini.
1,received mine with rust on it. may have been used.  did not seem to be well made. returned it.
1,These gloves don't give when trying to put them on. they must run small. they were delivered on time. If the gloves don't have powder in them or they don't stretch I have a hard time putting them on.
1,poor quality.
1,Very cheap screws that break of with the slights of pressure..  I understand over torquing it but I used the slightest of pressure to screw it in and it snapped off the dead
1,be very careful and seem to plug up after one use so not very good for small jobs
1,This stuff is kinda bad quality. Got it during the Buy one Get 2 free deal, This filament does not like any type of retraction or else it will jam up failing the print. I was hopping for better results.
1,Cheapest instruments ever made.  Quality is WELL sub par.  Don't  even buy to tide you over until you get a better set.
1,These hoses are extremely stiff and will not lie flat.  Possibly makes them more durable but they do not lie flat making them hard to use and a trip hazard.
1,I had some previous 15 x 20 containers that fit my cabinets. These are MUCH bigger than 15 x 20 and would not fit in my cabinets. And the picture shows 2 containers, but there is only 1. Disappointed!!
1,I printed 3 small items.  They all printed brittle and the layers have gaps. Very noticeable gaps of missing filament in prints. Their black filament does not do this. I noticed with the white filament only....I had to move my MP Mini Select V2 Extruder tube around just to get the filament to go through. So brittle feeling. I will post a picture of their filament vs another Priline. I printed a Mario Kart.
1,it takes to much torque to cut ok for the first 3 sizes then it just stops and i have 1 hp drill press
1,The workmanship on this over-priced PanaVise 308 Weighted Base Mount is unbelievably poor. It has casting blemishes and metal burrs that were not sanded before painting. The three tapped screw holes were not drilled in the right locations. One screw hole is drilled off-center by 1/2 inch. PanaVise should be ashamed to stamp "Made in USA" on this abomination.
1,Reads 77 degrees all the time, tried taking out the batteries to reset it a few times and still 77 degrees. Past the return period so I guess I'll use it for a paper weight.
1,Georgia Pacific calls these "Premium" paper towels. If these are premium I would sure hate to see what they would call every day or standard. They are great for checking the oil in your car.
1,I am a pretty experienced hobby woodworker.  I personally don't care for this glue.  It's messy, it foams up, isn't as strong as other PVA glues like Titebond in tests.  Overall, if I want a waterproof glue I'll use Titebond 3.
1,Great printer, especially for the price. I have some notes:		It is advertised as ready to go out of the box, but as other users have mentioned, the z-axis may need to be adjusted. My end offset was 2.1 mm. Additionally, the build platform was not level, with respect to the carriage for the nozzle. I was able to remedy this by loosening the screws (hex drive) that hold the glass to the platform, and adjusting a separate screw underneath the glass to level out the right side.		After making those adjustments, the Da Vinci Jr. prints like a dream for me. I am not sure how I feel about the proprietary filament, but that is the price you pay for an inexpensive printer (see ink jet business model). I don't think that aspect will impact low volume users.		UPDATE 1 5/30/2015 :	After almost 2 weeks of trying to get the printer to work consistently, I have given up. I never experienced the error codes seen by other users, but I did have significant problems with the hardware. Specifically, the carriage for the print head being unsupported on the right side. The sage can be accounted for by leveling the build plate, which I did initially. I quickly changed this back, as it was difficult to get the same alignment of the plate and carriage, and it was not addressing the problem in the appropriate area.		All in all, I never once got a complete print. Even simple objects would not start correctly (filament not sticking to glass, paper, painter's tape, glue stick), or if it did, the printer would print portions improperly, resulting in layers being out of place. Additionally, like other users, I heard a knocking sound from the top of the print head, as if too much filament was being fed and was kicked back. Support suggested adjusting the Z offset, but by the time it was high enough to alleviate this issue, the filament was coming out of the nozzle to high above the build plate to stick properly.		You get what you pay for. I put a little too much hope in this printer for the price, and it is ALMOST there. Unfortunately, I am returning it, and saving up for a more reliable model.
1,I don't like to write bad reviews but I do always want to be honest and honestly this item is a bit of a let down.  I can't really complain as it was just under $3.00 but it isn't quality by any means.  The light itself is not very bright and the button to turn it on is right under the end of the clip.  This may be a common place to put the on button but here the clip is pretty tight so it seems to turn itself on even with the slightest unwanted pressure.  As far a pressing the on button it is very small so you have to make sure you press down just in the right spot or you'll be fiddling with it for sure.		On the plus side I do like that it is reusable so you don't have to just throw it away - just pop in a new battery and it is good to go.		Overall it is worth what I paid but not what I had hoped. I don't recommend the product I think there must be better lights without the issues I described maybe for a little more.		Cheers!
1,Using 2 pills in Am and 2 Pills in PM with no change in health
1,Too early to tell how well it works.		Big problem was that one of the bottle's lid does not tighten enough to seal.  Had to transfer to another bottle I had handy.
1,More expensive because it claims to be a superior product... well that's just baloney!  Came factory sealed with a a humidity card showing over 40% and printed poorly at all temperatures that I tried: 190c, 200c, 210c and 220c.  I experienced low bed adhesion using multiple strategies, stringy prints with low layer adhesion.  If that isn't bad enough, the roll was obviously poorly wound leading to one snag (1 is too many).  Seriously, I have used many brands of filament and this is the worst I have experienced.  I get great prints using Hatchbox, USAfilament, Ninjaflex, Polyflex and I print mostly ABS and PLA but this PLA is simply unworkable.  Based on other reviews (and there aren't many) perhaps this roll is an anomaly, but I'm not going to try another one to find out!
1,The software accompanying the printer is poor, poor, POOR and any help you seek from XYZPrinting  assumes you have the intellect of a monkey.  I asked, "How do you tell the printer that the object to be printed is hollow?"  The answer I got was word for word from the Software instructions for calibrating the Scanner.  I asked again and now they wanted a picture and other documentation of the object.  I STILL don't know how to tell the printer that the object is hollow.	The printer does an acceptable job of printing.	Overall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this printer.
1,I used this on a leaking garden hose and it didn't work. It may have some other uses but don't count on it to fix a leaking hose.	It does stick to itself though so conceivably there is a use for it. I just haven't found it yet.
1,Sealant is fine, but the shipping took forever.
1,Not worth the money spent, cheap at the Marts
1,Rolls nicely, was easy to assemble. My only gripe is that the blue mat is super thin and already destroyed after a day and a half of light use.  So now it looks like crap but it still functions just fine.
1,Not a good product sometimes u can get away with being cheap not here. I ended up paying $65 for a indicol and it was well worth it. This one u pretty much need a vise grips to tighten. The indicol can easily by hand. It seems to be the slringy washers that make the difference
1,<div id="video-block-R2342SS1GKEMPF" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aUvgCXIGS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91nyM82EWPS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;Very intermittent!! Sometimes it works & sometimes it won't. Be sure to check everything well before you keep it the 30 days.	Probably best to avoid this one, not to waste your time.
1,Proprietary filament for a horrible printer that leaves you with 20-30m left on the roll that you *cannot* use to print with. Horrible design and the filament quality is sub-par to boot.
1,Was in a spot where sun could hit it and the writing seems to now be there forever.  Will not erase.  A real bummer.
1,I have purhased 4 or 5 different types of Loctite epoxy glue from 2 or 3 different retailers. I always mix the epoxy exactly as directed and I apply it exactly as directed. Yet, NONE of the Loctite epoxys have worked very well. They are not as strong as epoxys I used in my younger days. Recently I bought a Loctite epoxy that was designed to be used with plastic. The glue never hardened... even after 24 hours!  It remained a gooey mess. The process of cleaning up the soft glue created a huge mess because it stuck to everything it touched. You are probably wondering why I bought 4 or 5 bottles of this stuff before I finally learned my lesson.  Well, the stores in my area carry the Loctite brand and they don't carry much else.  So, I kept buying Loctite in hopes that I would get good results. It never happened. I will never again waste my money on Loctite epoxy.
1,This stuff is crap. I cannot get consistent prints. It has bubbles and is not consistent in thickness. When I get a good print its awesome but thats only like 1 out of 20 prints.
1,Disappointed to receive .80kg when the listing is clearly for 1 kg. Avoid purchasing unless you're expecting .80kg. Note that the sellers title is obfuscate in the sense that they bury in the listing that it's 1kg total weight which includes the spool. However after weighing the filament with the spool, it weighs 1.9lbs. It's obvious that putting 1kg in the title and having the photo of the filament show a sticker that says 1kg that SainSmart is trying to pull one over on us.
1,All packed in one baggy. I like my stuff individually wrapped and sterile. I'd NEVER buy these again!!
1,This is not a true ABS product.		It appears to be MABS - a clear more brittle form of the ABS family of plastics.		Glow is decent , but nothing special. overall it works but it is not ABS and lacks the impact resistance.
1,Unfortunately, I have had to change my mind on this one:		This printer is impressive.  It works straight out of the box.  There is a great, helpful community out there that will gladly help you get it up and running and working great.  it prints beautifully when it works, which is the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of one.		The problems start when things start to break.  Monoprice does not have/sell replacement parts for it, so you have to look elsewhere.  BUT THEY HAVE  A ONE YEAR GUARANTEE!!!  That looks amazing in writing, but in practice, if you buy from amazon instead of from their website, they treat you like a second-rate customer.  I have been waiting for weeks now to have my printer replaced, and keep getting told they don't have any in stock, which is an outright lie on their part.  I know, and have seen proof, of people in these same printer groups on facebook that have RMAed printers after mine, and already gotten replacements.  That's simply not acceptable.  If you're going to offer a guarantee, and highlight it in your sale thread, you should definitely back that up.		I'm really dissapointed in this, because up until I had to deal with the RMA and their service department I had a good opinion of their company.  Now, I would not buy from them again, and I highly recommend that even after reading this review if you're going to buy this printer, buy it from their site not amazon.  That's simply not ok with me.
1,This is the worst gas can I've ever used!  Just received it tonight.  I temporarily working in CA.  Amazon shipping would not ship any other fuel container to CA, so I saw the great reviews and bought this one.  There is another traditional 5 gal fuel jug that says it's CARB approved, but they will not ship it to CA either!.		First, the lid mechanism is spring loaded to the closed position by two very large springs.  It takes quite a bit of hand strength to open the lid.  There is no way my wife or grandson could open it.  They wouldn't even be able to put gas into the container with these stout springs.		Second, the yellow funnel arrangement seems nice on first glance, until you try to use it!  It mounts to the spout on a 90 degree angle so you cannot get the gas can tilted enough to get all the gas out.  My cars fuel filler spout (and most others) goes into the car at a 45 degree angle.  If I tilt the gas can all the way (sideways/90 degrees) the funnel interferes and wants to pop out of the 45 degree fuel neck (the funnel then wants to point straight down).  I could only get maybe 3 of 5 gallons out.  I tried to turn it sideways but it will only go so far.  I finally was able to get 4 out of 5 gallons out while spilling it all over my shoes, the side of the car, and the ground.		There needs to be a way to swivel the spout for different filler neck angles.  They also need to reduce the spring pressure on the spout and maybe add a safety lock to hold it down instead of that 50# of spring.		Now the good:  Its made pretty well and the steel is not as thin as I thought by reading some of the other posts.  It is compact and at first glance it does not look like 5 gallons, but it will hold 4.95.		Find an older designed gas can at a yard sale instead of this new design.
1,These are horrible--they are made of a hard plastic and the magnets are very, very weak. They are also made such that when they are sitting against the face of the vise jaws, the bottom of them is gapped such that they pivot forward very easily, and the weak ass magnets don't hold them in position to let you get them closed, the rock out of square and often one or the other simply falls out of the vise.	Awful!!
1,This falls under the "too good to be true" rule.  At best it makes a weak, fragile attachment between two pieces of glass. And plan to only get 2 uses, the first time you open the tube and the second time when your forced to cut open the tube.
1,I saw the mixed reviews on the brightness of the glow effect and was very disappointed at my results with this filament.  I also have the Solutech glow in the dark filament and the effect is MUCH brighter.  Please note that in the attached image, the Hatchbox print is on the right and the Solutech print is on the left.
1,Really cheesy
1,Very thin and cheap.  You get what you pay for.  Not a good buy.
1,Light sucks . . . Just use a regular inspection mirror and a small flashlight, it's hard to get the light and the mirror to line up to see exactly what you want to see.  It's just awkward.  Sorry Ullman, nice try though.
1,The remaining will more than likely be sent back, I installed about 12 feet of this and it all fell off over night.  What a joke this stuff is. Defective right out of the box.
1,So far I've tried filament from 3 separate companies, and this has been the only one of the 3 I had problems with.  I bought the Chocolate Brown and the silver, both were wrapped so poorly that it failed prints simply because the filament was caught in the spool and couldn't feed.  But that's not the only problem I had.  I had actually paid someone to create a model for me and I had them do two reworks because the print would fail between 1/3 and 2/3 through - it would start getting stringy and trash the entire print.  I never had this problem before with this printer but I tried everything - cleaning it out, re-leveling it twice, etc.  After their 2nd rework he said there's nothing wrong with the model and suggested that I check my printer, I switched filaments to a Hatchbox spool.  It printed perfectly right out of the gate.  I apologized to the designer, tipped him for his trouble and vowed never to buy filament from this company again.
1,Mine came with a PTFE liner in the heat break, despite the product description saying they are "all metal stainless heat break".  There are reviewers saying theirs were all metal, but it appears to be a crap shoot what you are going to get.  Mine also came with a large threaded bowden connector on top instead of the direct connect shown in the product pictures.  This results in the total height being about 10mm taller than a real E3D V6, making it difficult to use as a drop in replacement.		The individual components look decent enough, but mine came pre-assembled and very poorly so. The thermistor sleeves were not seated properly, leaving exposed wire touching the heat block causing a short.  The nozzle was also screwed flush to the heat block leaving the heat break too loose.  The people assembling these things don't seem to know how to do it.		Overall, pretty disappointed.
1,Wont stick to anything.  Worthless
1,The metal bar is paper thin the plastic endstops are inadequate. No bearings obviously so some drag this holder will walk around where it wants to eventually the spool falls when the endstop works out mid print.
1,Shipping was very slow. I bought this to replace the zprobe on my migbot printer. After connecting the probe, it will light up (dimly) when it senses the metal, but is not enough to trip the limit switch on the control board.  The probe I received was blue instead of the orange one pictured and was very thin.  I ordered one that was 2 dollars more and it works perfect.
1,I bought this switch to repair an old Grizzly TSC-10L table saw.  Looked really nice, and I read a lot of the reviews before buying it.  Let's just say the reviewers that said this switch is too big for a normal size box are dead on accurate.  It is too big, but there's an even more annoying problem than that.  The contacts inside aren't sealed from dust.  Within a couple of weeks of having it installed, I had to tear it out to clean up the saw dust inside and it ran again for a few more weeks until I failed again.		This time I tore it down completely, opened up the back side to look at the actual switching mechanism.  The neutral line contacts were so badly carbonized due to the dust intrusion that they were no longer making contact.  Cleaning them with some emery paper solved that problem, but after seeing how easily it was for dust to get inside, I decided to just not bother re-installing it.  Instead I picked up a 20A standard toggle switch and cover plate.		Now my saw is working again with a regular size box and the wires aren't crammed in there.  It's a shame really it's a nice LOOKING product, but it's design is flawed in that it isn't protected from dust intrusion, something that should be considered when it's a switch designed for tools that generate lots of dust.		I can't even imagine the problems you might have if this were being using in a metal shop and metal dust and shavings were to get inside this switch.
1,The tubing itself is ok but the sizes are horrible.  I'm using it mostly for quadcopter builds and the green size is about the only one that fist most applications.  The other sizes are either way way too small or way too large.  Just not a good fit for quad builds.
1,complete junk fitting
1,Started bubbling and popping out of the box. not recommended
1,Inaccurate temperatures; is always 2 to 5 degrees off. Also skips numbers, i.e., 75, 76 and 78 degrees always reads 77. This is one weird piece of crap. DO NOT purchase.
1,Ten readings taken one after the other yield ten different values varying by 10 PSI up and down. Unit must be allowed to turn itself off (time out) before a new reading is taken. Absolute junk.
1,refurbished item that worked for about three weeks before it quit working never pays to buy refurbished junk
1,Barely bright enough to serve as a reading light, and a sickly bluish color.
1,These weren't compatable with my sander, and were never used.
1,This is not a stick-on Velcro.  As the title reads, sew-on Velcro.  I bought a lot---my bad---  I will Ty to return..
1,this is great for the price, the tester is better than the one I bought for almost twice as much as this whole kit cost me.	Update, tester lasted about a month, RJ45 crimper lasted about a month, then would not line up with pins on connector.	Would not buy again.
1,Returned this item
1,Looks nice, but the rack doesn't lock into the frame.  Tubes can be jettisoned from the rack if it collapses/
1,I dunno how this stuff got 5 star reviews from anyone. It's annoying to use, having a paper/plastic backing you need to peel off, it's stiff and doesn't conform well to curves. It definitely would not last long on textiles as some other reviewer suggested (maybe we got different versions?). All that isn't so far out of the realm of normal though for prismatic tape; what really irked me is that it's really not that reflective. I find it no more visible in the dark with artificial lighting than regular white vinyl tape (which is cheaper, easier, and sticks better).
1,I intended to use these to travel my cologne and beard oil.	Over half of them have leaked.	Today I trashed the rest of them as well, just to be on the safe side.
1,I agree with the others that say the etching is too light or faint on the item received. I thought perhaps those people got a bad one, hard to believe that Miller would make anything that doesn't function.		There is a hole with a key ring, but the tool arrived bent at that hole.		If you need a useful and easy to read guage, look elsewhere until Miller sorts this one out.
1,Pice of crap. Buy a real graduated cylinder.
1,I calibrated this item to 1.000 and it still reads high.	Both the water and beer being at room Temp this unit reads the beer much higher then a Hydrometer.
1,It works, but it's messy and not re-usable. I was much happier after switching to a home brew etchant consisting of Hydrochloric Acid and Hydrogen Peroxide. Read this Instructable, it will change your entire outlook on etchants. http://www.instructables.com/id/Stop-using-Ferric-Chloride-etchant!--A-better-etc/?ALLSTEPS
1,I mean literally! The unit started smoking near the trigger area as soon as a battery was installed without having been turned on. The smoke stopped and I was able to measure temperatures on 3 surfaces, but then the upper trigger area got hot to touch (gradually got hotter after 2 min of non-use) which forced me to remove the battery for safety. The next morning, the unit didn't turn on at all. The company obviously dropped the ball on QA. Returning the unit.
1,Out of three pieces received, one arrive good, one broken where the glass tube and bulb meet, and one with the bulb glued to the glass tube making washing near impossible.  The ok unit works well, great for measuring and transferring acid to a mash tun.  The other two, not so much.
1,First off, I have TWO of these units, the first I'd purchased from Amazon, the second was a replacement sent free by Amazon when I requested a return on the first due to accuracy issues. I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.		To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.		The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.		FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.
1,Loudest fan ever! I threw it away.
1,not the best dose not work as good as i expected left with a blank look in my face need to work much better
1,The magnets shipped in a small white cardboard box. Inside the box the magnets were just loose but obviously all clumped and connected. So the random nature of this led the magnet to scratch the white paint on other hooks. Basically they all had black/gray scrapes and marks on the white paint since no separation or padding was put between each hook. While they "work" technically as magnets with hooks, the whole point of nicely white painted hooks was to look nice when used and this completely failed.
1,Dont expect the fully charged battery to last long as it runs down very quickly. The brush works good for small debris. Charging takes some time too.
1,I bought this on a whim, $12, why not? Well I haven't had 1 successful print with this filament. Changing slice properties to a 1.3mm diameter filament setting helped, but the filament extrudes very thin.
1,Break under torque.
1,Did I say these are cheap quality, they leak and fail very rapidly. Was using a gentle mix of Baby Shampoo and Water for some 3m Cover and after just a few pumps it started to leak, figured maybe I didn't tighten properly. I took pump off, wiped all down and closed up - no spray at all. repeated and it leaked profusely.
1,Photo cell is too low.
1,This picture is very misleading.  You think you are getting normal sized hooks but you are not.  See that piece with a top and bottom hole?  A pen would fit comfortably inside.  Those red tipped hooks are too short for a garden hand trowel .  Plus, they are too thin for the peg board holes so they hang down too much.  Even if they fit a bit better in the smaller peg boards as mentioned, they are way too short in length to serve a purpose anyway.  Return.
1,Very chintzy and light weight. Would use temporarily in case of emergency.
1,About a weeks worth of duty on a 3d printer which didn't print more than maybe 4 hours.
1,I had wondered why my very expensive sapplings were dying since I was monitoring them so closely.  After reading reviews about this montor, I checked the digital readout for temperature against that of several very dependable thermometers and this instrument reads 5 DEGREES TOO LOW!  I was cooking my sapplings because I thought the temperature was low enough to keep them out of the risk of harm.  I do not know about the hygrometer; but, if the reading were important to me, I would also check it against other reliable sources.  These reviews helped me find the deadly link in my plant growing setup.  The temperature gauge was very inaccurate!  Display quit working several months after it arrived.  Undependable.
1,I will not buy again.  I usually buy Hatchbox or Inland but they did not have Chocolate.	Not because  Hatchbox or Inland is great but because most formulas print at same temp and speed with no problems no matter the color.	This filament does not stick to my plastic build plate.  Maybe it sticks to something else but not my build plate.	I had to go from normal 200C to 230C to even have a chance and it still separated (lifted).
1,Company sent a replacement of my first order very fast after request, but the problem turned out to be that ALL their throats are the same garbage and in fact not polished inside at all. Looks like they polished it outside for some reason, and also attempted polishing inside too, as they are indeed slightly better than generic Chinese $0.25 ones. However this is not bore polished, I think what they did is bought cheap chinese garbage ones and tried to electroplate them. Which is not a proper way of polishing, and the result is bumps covered with a new layer of metal. Same bumps, same bad surface. Can't give this anything over 1 star, sorry. Wasted my time with this and $8 or whatever it was. Didn't bother returning a second set.
1,Hard to open and use. Gross pH measurements only - somewhat difficult to match color, as you have to go by the HUE, not the opaqueness of the color on the strip.
1,It is Tiny!	No wiring instructions came with this button.
1,I did not receive the same product as what is pictured here, but so be it. What really frosts my jaw with this toothbrush is that I only get 5 or 6 brushings out of it before the battery runs out of gas and needs to be recharged. I bought this product because Braun is supposed to be a highly acclaimed German engineering & manufacturing company. They really disappointed me with this product.
1,These are not borosilicate as the description says.  They're nice little dropper bottles, and I think the internal tube is likely borosilicate, but the bottle itself is not.
1,Na.  Older models of this product far exceeds performance than these newer ones.  I have two old models and two new ones and the comparison between them is huge.  These newer models don't seem to charge all the way or run time is less than half of older models.  Charge light may go out and the switch may not have any effect.  Bottom line is that when it runs, it is a perfect product for pet owners.		UPDATE:  Two 780s later... One would run a reasonable time.  Second will run 2 minutes and quit after a full night's charge.  Unit is great, but batteries suck... like being very healthy except for the stage 4 cancer.  Ordering replacement batteries from Shark is stupid as they cost $15 higher than a new vacuum!  Too bad Shark has not figured this out.
1,good
1,To begin with, the pieces are randomly cut, and not at neat, 90 degree angles. Some of the cuts go through the mounting holes, some do not. No two pieces are alike.	The aluminum is much thinner than other brands I have used, and it lacks the stiffening bends seen in other rails. It seems too flimsy to mount breakers or anything else that might take the slightest strain.
1,Update: After some extensive use and on my 2nd sheet of this Im changing this from 5star to 2star. Trying to print anything somewhat wide or long in area that also has a 1/2"+ in height will cause this sheet to rip up from the build plate (and your print from the sheet). While you *can* get some permanent 3m adhesive sheeting, that screws up your ability to shim the PEI which is required since none of these sheets are even remotely flat. I estimate variations +/- 1mm will leave you frustrated if any of your prints require precision. Theres no reason they cant make these sheets precise, the tech exists, this is just lazy manufacturing. Im going to look towards solid specialized buildplates since there is no way to have this adhere to the printbed AND be level.		---old----	PEI works great with PETG, no heat necessary at ~75f. Its kinda hard to get up thin sheets but thicker prints you can pull right off. I used this on a robo 3d r1+ with double sided sticky tape as there is no room for clips and adhesive sheets appear to be a more permanent solution. This has allowed me to use the whole build area since heat is not needed.
1,The new Brand III formulation has only 58% ethanol. This is under the 60% minimum recommended for hand sanitizers, so I wouldn't trust it in a surface disinfectant, either.
1,Insanely BUZZY
1,Went to use this just today, there is a crack in the housing preventing it from being tightened enough to hold anything. Already have a replacement on the way. I'll update this review once I have the new vice and am able to use it.
1,Here is the product description at the time I ordered this:		"Jewelry DoodleBlock Kit, complete with two packs of 3Doodler Start Eco-Plastic. 3Doodler Start DoodleBlocks are special 3D templates to help you create some of our favorite projects."		To me, Jewlery DoodleBlock Kit, complete with... indicates you are getting a "complete" DoodleBlock Kit.		Clearly I am not alone, judging from the large number of other upset reviewers. Handheld 3D printers were new last Christmas, and even then many of them were not expensive. So it seemed believable that a _starter kit_ would be $15 and include all you needed to do a few projects and then order more supplies to do more. What is not believable is that they would be this misleading in the product description and pictures.		It should be called something like "Jewelry Kit FOR 3 Doodler 3D Pen" or anything that doesn't create dozens of reviews where the purchaser thought they were getting a functionable product and not just supplies for a product.		This is essentially a SUPPLY PACK for the 3 Doodler 3D Pen.  It is NOT a "3Doodler Starter Kit" or a "DoodleBlock Kit."		I do not think the manufacturer deliberately did this to fool people, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is so poorly described. Most supply packs like this have warnings or labeling that makes it clear that the required primary device isn't actually included so that this kind of mistake doesn't happen. These days, even OBVIOUS things (like say you order an iPhone protector case for $7, they will still say "DOES NOT INCLUDE IPHONE" even though no one would think it included an iPhone.) have warnings - this kit is grossly negligent in not making that clear.		1 star until they fix the labels to keep people from wasting their time and money on a product that doesn't include the needed device to actually use the product for anything. Disappointing.
1,How can people be promoting this glue like this? People are becoming ILL from using this. Plus, it does not work very well! I have used this glue on crystal, metal, plastic and glass. It can easily be pulled apart by a child. --Even though, it should NEVER BE USED IN A HOME WITH CHILDREN! .. Please, please, use something else!!! Otherwise, use a respirator. There are other reviewers who say they use a respirator (not just a simple fume mask. A respirator.) ..But why use something that requires a respirator?! .. Please use something else.		Good luck, friends. I hope that you can find an alternative. Two-part epoxies are waaaay better, by the way! "Devcon 2-Ton" is clear and is is waaaay stronger, with just about no small at all.
1,Really just plain garbage. Half of them say I pass half of them say I failed. Its been well over a month since I smoked and I was a casual smoker at the time. Don't waste your money.
1,I keep hoping to find a bronze filament that's bronze, and this one isn't it. At best it's a yellow ochre color - no metallic properties and certainly no actual bronze. Disappointing. May be good for a poop emoji though.		And after the poop emoji it made a nice loofah sponge out of what should have been a sculpture with 20% fill. Unfortunately iy decided that clogging the nozzle was more fun, so is getting returned to Amazon innediately. Crap filament.
1,Tried it on aluminum and a steel hole I drilled and does not cut. Seems the blades were ground flat. Had to return.
1,I bought a hundred of the male and female connectors. These things are terrible. The metal is way to thin and will not grip heavy copper like 10 to 12 gauge as it's meant to. Tried three crimps, none worked. Do not use for heavy wire. Poor poor quality. I can't return mine because I live in another country.
1,This is not tape. It is a wrap the fuses to itself. It will not stick to other surfaces
1,maybe if u wanted to  upholster a seat on a chair ok other wise  not good for wood workers sad
1,Hard to find a quality pen light for patient use, and I hoped these would be of decent quality. Only one worked, and yes I tried new batteries.
1,Don't buy this printer if you plan to use 3rd party filament. The accompanied software is annoying with ads.	I bought this printer from BH. It came with a cartridge of yellow ABS. XYZ cartridge only contains 0.6Kg of material. I bought a XYZ natural PLA filament 0.6Kg cartridge for $27; what a rip-off. The PLA cartridge talks with the software; its extruder temperature is 145C with platform at 45C. That's very low for PLA. The software that came with the printer, on a CD/DVD, keeps asking you you install update every time running it. As soon as you update, it will absolutely force you to create an account with XYZ and login before you can enter the application - you have no choice. Once you've created an account and login, it won't bother with asking to login again, but keeps popping up with notice of some other software offer FREE and not-so-free from XYZ, along with another pop up telling you 3rd party filament won't give you a good result.	I had to drill the hood of the unit to accept other filament. See attached pictures.	If you happened to run out of filament, good luck with trying to get the stuck filament out. The feeding motor is NOT at the extruder assembly. I had to totally disassemble the extruder to get at the filament.	The 3D scanner is very poor in quality/resloution. You're better off buying a separate 3D scanner on Amazon.	Bad design, annoying software, expensive proprietary filament cartridge, & low quality 3D scanner.	This printer is slower than other brand printer in the same price range. No, I don't get discount or paid for review. Every dime I spent on tech comes from my paycheck.
1,did not work so well
1,These are cheaply made terminals that do not crimp well, even with a quality Greenlee ratcheting terminal crimper.
1,these terminals are not as heavy duty as those purchase from HomeDepot, although they are rated the same. Really worried about if these can hold up the same amount of electric current. Easily deformed when crimping to wires, easily loosen up after crimping. The metal material is too thin to hold the shape.
1,It's a good thing I couldn't find a smaller package of these. I only need six and it took almost the entire package to get six that didn't just snap into pieces.		There are not enough letters in the word "garbage" to describe the degree to which these are garbage.		Honestly, I'd have thought this would be something that was impossible to foul up.		Never underestimate the power of people to find new ways to do things.		It almost restores my faith in humanity.
1,the humidity is 6-8 5 off & temp. is 2 degrees off. & seller has not got back to me.
1,Good price for this set.  Will find better way to store small weights. Update: you have to be kidding, you cant even make a 50 gram weight right. There was a piece of metal and two metal balls in the bottom of the container...turns out my 50 gramer decided to take a dump and is now in the high 48 to low 49 g range.
1,I would give them 1 star, but perhaps should give them 3, as I'm not that knowledgeable about bearings, but it says "SEALED" and unlike all other bearings similar to this on router bits etc., the INSIDE is solid sleeve/bushing, w/ ball bearings sealed between layers. This one's ball bearings are exposed, destined to get lodged w/ dirt in most shops, and they fell out when I tried inserting a partially threaded bolt  up to the unthreaded portion.
1,I Have had nothing but trouble with this roll. I should have returned it after the first problem.  The roll was wound up incorrectly constantly stopping prints and getting Tangled Up. Also noticed some color differences  throughout the roll.
1,ok
1,they show temperature with using 11 but they are way off, I used them in 2 different printers and the temperatures were off, I had to heat to 220 to get PLA to print, checked it out, all 4 heads (2 dual head systems) were off by 50 degrees.	No where did it say in the description that it is meant for marlin or a specific setting in marlin so cant really say it was false advertising but I bet if everyone that posted reviews checked their temps with a good thermometer they would find them off.	Now that I have spent several days calibrating them i can finally get wood grain effects in my wood filament.	see[...] for the settings that I found to work.
1,Review amended. Used it for a few days. This thing is useless. Very hard menu screens. Never stays on farenheight. Backlight won't stay on. Junk. Save your money and order a Fluke.	The company after reading this review offered me a exchange or refund. I choose a refund and it was issued the next day.
1,Ordered 5/16" DIA but received 3/8" DIA.  Item is in good condition, but unusable to me.  Not worth having someone turn this to the diameter I need.
1,Looks like it would work fine if it came with all the parts. Missing several bolts and nuts to hold it together.
1,$15 too much for shipping. no sale. Amazon, shame on you for allowing high shipping rates.
1,very abrasive and did not get good prints, may be my settings though.	I would not buy it again
1,Visibly flexes while cutting, showing just how cheap the metal is. I've tapped hundreds of holes before this, and had previously only broken a single tap. From this set the M3 broke in the first hole, M4 in the third hole, and M5 in the sixth hole. All in 6061 aluminum.		Most people seem to be having decent results with these, so they can be made to work. Just go REALLY easy, use tapping fluid, and bail out the second you feel the slightest resistance.		But really, is it worth it? Are you saving enough money by buying bargain bin taps to risk ruining your workpiece?
1,Disappointed.  Returning.  Nothing more to say.
1,This stuff is terrible. Using a Robo 3D R1 Plus, I tried my standard PLA print settings that I've used with no issues in the past, which are 220 extrusion temp and 50 heated bed and it spit it out like chewed up bubble gum, if it came out at all. Had just got done printing with ABS at 235 extrusion temp and 80 heated bed so I figured I'd give that a try. Worked good for a couple seconds, but because it's so much hotter than it should be, there are strings everywhere, loss of details, and the supports and rafts are near impossible to remove without damaging the prints. Majority of the print process looked nice and smooth but the last three layers ended up bubbling up really bad so the whole print was ruined. I dropped the temperature to 230 extrusion and 70 heated bed but it resulted in clog after clog after clog. Just threw away 2/3 of a spool and cracked open some Hatchbox silver PLA and so far, it's printing 1000 times better with no clogs and it doesn't look like thick taffy stuck everywhere. Never again using this brand. Have had much success with Hatchbox up to this point and it seems to be continuing that trend with their silver PLA.
1,Plug pops out like others. Clamp is too short inside unit. Works great otherwise, but don't expect the female portion to work consistently or properly. Inside just broke on me. Another poor product in the trash!
1,Bed cracked after less than 2 months of use, trying to get a replacement bed is impossible, they say warranty doesn't cover so not only is the machine made with sub par materials the warranty is now sub par as well. This is sad, I really liked robo, guess they went in a new direction and are cheaping out everywhere.
1,I always been using 1.75mm filament, recently I bought an Ultimaker2+ and since colorfabb and 3mm filament are expensive with regards to this type I decided to try it what the worse could happen right?	Ultimaker printer is $2500 not a cheap printer, and it really print well, it came with 1 PLA spool from Ultimaker that it cost $50.	it worked fine and great, with that filament, I bought this and I use it on ultimaker only took 5min to jam my feeder that I had to take it apart on a new expensive printer to pull it out, it seems that this brand on PLA is very brittle and not uniform in diameter lucky I was able to save my printer and took me 3 hours after midnight to fix it, as this would have damaged the printer I would had to file a lawsuit against this company.	 I don't know if any of you did print with this brand on Ultimaker if you do please let me know how?
1,work a few times
1,I was so excited to get my first 3D printer I could hardly wait! My heart sank when I opened the outer box and saw that the inner box had already been opened and had the flaps folded in as whoever repackaged it could not be bothered to tape it shut. I went ahead with removing the printer and begin setting it up per the instructions. Once I began the bed leveling procedure I saw why this might have been a returned unit as the bed was so warped that it would be impossible to level seeing how the center was so bowed in. I spent an hour trying to level the four corners and each time finding that it was so off in the center you could fit 3-4 sheets of paper thickness between the extruder nozzle and the bed. The aluminum bed is very thin and I can see this being a real issue for folks as it will easily bend and warp trying to pry off prints. I knew at this time I would have to return it. I decided to play around with the menu before I packaged it back up just to get a feel for the machine and that's when I found other issues that could have contributed to the return of this unit. For one, the bed would not stop at the outer right Y axis movement causing loud thuds as it reach the outer limit. This is not good. The second issue for this unit is a not functional micro sd card reader. It would not read the card at all. I took the card to my laptop and it was fine. i was able to read all the contents but the printer would not read it at all. Another issue was filament stuck in the extruder feed and nozzle from a previous use that would have required me to disassemble the hot end to clear out. An issue I discovered that I think affects all units has to do with the selection wheel. You have to press in on the wheel to make selections, but almost every time I tried to do this it would change the selection to the next item as it clicked causing unwanted items to be selected. This is very annoying. The color menus are very nice and easily readable so that's a big plus. I wish more printers had menus this nice. The packaging was adequate as it was triple boxed and the unit itself in-cased in styrofoam to protect it. As others mentioned mine came with a small coil of white filament, an allen key, micro sd card, and a plastic scraper. A big disappointment for me as I had already bought several rolls of filament and designed a few items in sketchup that I was excited to print but now I have to wait on the return process and refund to purchase a different unit. I am going to step out on a limb and buy one of the kits here on Amazon and build it myself. I think it will allow me to have a better understanding of how to maintain and upgrade the unit.
1,Mine did not work.
1,The ball joint that lets you use the vise at different angles isn't very secure. I found myself tapping on my project and having the whole ball joint move or the vise rotate which defeats the purpose of having the vise so I returned it.
1,Garbage
1,One can hear well but because the head is too loose, it flip flops to one side to another. I will not buy again.
1,Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.
1,I am a very experienced Thermographer. I've been handling these tools just about as they hit the markets in the 1980's in the Fire department when Scott came out with a bully black and white version.	I've have personally owned 2 other IR cameras and Extech i5 and currently own a Flir Bcam 40.	 I review items as I work or have used them for some time. So this review comes with over 25 years of real world use.	 I have a loaded a few pictures to show this small Ir-camera is well worth the $$.	It does have some draw backs but the cost most definitely out ways the draw backs.	 Good; Cost, size for ease of storage or to carry around.  Easy set up, started right away and ease to change settings.	Poor points; App fails and crashes frequently, usb pin length. usb orientation.	Major Bad point; Battery goes dead. You will need a supplemental back up battery.
1,Very poor quality. I bought these to use for 3D printed spinners. They do not spin as freely as they should, they are very stiff. I've used bearings that will spin for over a minute very easily but these are just cheaply made junk. I guess you get what you pay for.		EDIT: A few days later and these are even worse than they were before. The one bearing feels like it's grinding when spinning. Another one of the bearings is making noises when spun. Like I said, you get what you pay for and I got crappy bearings.
1,SEOH is the seller, but the beakers are LabZap, Or should I say LabCrap.  The quality from that manufacturer leaves much to be desired.		The several times I have ordered glassware and received LabZap I returned it post-haste.  Imperfections that feel like sand grains, nicks are both typical.  I' ve had enough.  I am DONE buying anything that is LabZap.
1,Many of these have sporadic readings, and will cause my inputs to go to max or min values when i squeeze the case, will not buy again!
1,Informative information, but its basically carboard, overpriced!
1,It's hard to understand why products like this are so badly designed and still so positively reviewed.		A holder like this is only appropriate for loose filament.		If you put an actual spool with 1kg worth of plastic onto the spindle, which is barely suitable for dispensing toilet paper, it doesn't roll across the spindle: it drags its way across it.		Your extruder has enough work to do without trying to drag 1kg of plastic around a toilet paper holder.  If you have a tangle in your spool, this will wind up tightening it until you get a jam.		The solution is to replace the spindle with ball-bearing (or printed gear bearing) supported cones which press into a spool, such that it is *only* supported by the bearings.		Once you do that, the filament spool will rotate freely enough to overshoot and possibly oscillate a little (mine oscillates a little when my x-carriage moves), which will help loosen up tangles you may run into.  I have not run into any tangles after this mod across a wide variety of filament.		Essentially, tangles are a result of bad spool management -- it is a physical fact every spool *will* have some level of tangle in it, yet everyone blames the filament and praises trash products like these.
1,Apart from the problems where a number of the nuts didn't have threads cut in them and were unusable, I don't appreciate getting spammed by sellers looking for positive feedback.	Appears to be no quality control in the manufacture of the this product, will not order this product or from this seller again.
1,All of the translucent Solutech PLA filament colors that I have tried (Blue, Red, Clear) were brittle. They also contained an excessive number of air bubbles. On prints with lots of retractions in a small area (aka: prints with multiple small islands), the extruder drive gear frequently grinds through the filament. This leads to failed prints. This sucks. It is possible to down-grade retraction settings and prevent this. However, diminished retraction settings lead to stringing. Therefore, this filament leaves me stuck between a rock (stringing) and a hard place (grinding). It's not worth the trouble. That said, Solutech opaque colors seem to be OK. Colors are vibrant, but filament diameter variation is frequently greater than the stated +/- .03.
1,My wife hated it.  We returned it.  Doesn't clean well at all.  Didn't use it long enough to review any other functions.
1,Hard to write an accurate review when they are so heavily censored. But we will try, here we have another Pr**e item that has doubled in cost and is no longer in any ballpark on price.
1,I'm disappionted in these screws, the washer head is small!
1,These terminals seem to be well made for the price, however they do not function well.		Once connected, the male and female "quick disconnects" are nearly impossible to pull apart. I had to use a vise and pliers to get them apart.		I ordered these with the intention of having something that I could quickly disconnect, but these do not fit the bill.		If you are only going to make a connection with these and do not plan to ever disconnect them, then I would say buy them. If you need to be able to pull them apart then get something else like a bullet connector.
1,Not strong at all
1,Arrived non-functional. After inserting the battery the screen lit up and it displayed 14 degrees F and 16% humidity. I thought it just needed to calibrate or something along those lines well after sitting for several minutes it refused to read anything other than 14/16. The only button on the device is to switch from F to C and all that did was display the same wrong temp in C.
1,this vac picks up okay, it is satisfactory, not at all superior as most reviews claim.  It picks up well if you put a new bag after each and every time you vacum, just once.  And it started smelling up my whole house with a really nasty smell after the 3rd time I cleaned. I bout extra bags with the deodorizing tablets with I change each vacuum, but the smell is still unbearable.  I would not reccomend this cleaner at all. I say spend a ;little more and get a better piece of eqipment.  I am not kidding you when I say it smells horrible!  Plus I discovered I do want attacments, I thought I could go without them, but I have corners and places that need asn attachment.  It leaves a path close to the baseboards it will not get to. I am not at all happy with this product.
1,Hello fellow Amazonians:	We purchased a number of these items based on the seemingly positive reviews it has. Unfortunately, they were constructed with poor quality materials and rather shoddily put together. I wish we had an option of not buying poorly made Chinese made products or products other countries who don't really have our interests in mind other than to sell thing to us. Unfortunately we'll be returning these items in search of a better quality product state side. Shame.
1,Very poor quality.  As cheap as they are, they're still not with the price (even if they were free).
1,not rubber - hard plastic
1,This didn't work for me.  I was puzzled that there is no "stickyness" to it.  I wrapped it around a leaking drip system hose. It was difficult to hold in place while it cured and kept slipping around.  I finally used other tape to hold it in place.  It was difficult to wrap tightly.  I didn't know what to expect.  After it cured, it still leaked through the windings.  The leak was not as bad but it didn't fix the problem.  Save your money and time, try a different solution,.
1,Not so good this filament worked when it wanted to clogged a lot never had so much trouble i bought it over the hatchbox with i usually get saved 6 bucks not worth it should have gone with what i know works. Just to make a note I'm not a newbie at 3d printing Ive been printing for some time now  I'm a Engineer for almost 20 years I know how to solve problems and I build CNC machines from scratch from mechanical to electrical to programming, i even build Computers to run the machines. I don't like to give bad reviews but no matter how i set my printer i could not get good results from this filament i would not recommend it.
1,Bought it for cooking purpose, but I don't think it is. Powdery.
1,Has a tendency to leak. Won't be buying these again.
1,This is not the best epoxy for reef tanks. The glue is very runny and comes off the frag plug while in the water. A few of my fish tried to eat it since it was floating in the water. That was very bad for the fish. Also this epoxy is not very strong, the red leg hermits pop the frags of the rock since the epoxy is not very strong.
1,I have ordered these twice about a year apart.  In total I purchased 6 units.  5 of them read within a % of each other.  One is way off...by 10 to 15%.  Although I would have liked all 6 to be matched this is not bad for such an inexpensive device.  I use mine to check my photographic equipment humidity box and to check the levels in the house.  Good product.  Have not bothered to contact Amazon or the vendor about the one bad unit.  Perhaps I will....perhaps too much trouble.  I am pleased with the product.  BTW two of my units (both read accurate) have been running over a year on the battery....so I think this is low battery consumption.  Very pleased.		UPDATE 5/27/16	I lowered my rating to two stars.  This review is not only the product but on Amazon.  Yes Amazon ..I have been a PRIME member for several years and make many many purchases.  I decided to return the one bad unit and the online information states I have till June 2 to initiate a return.  But when I go through the return process it states the item is not eligible for return and provides me a link to the return policy.  Of course I can not find anything that is associated with this device.  So...the product is good if you can accept a failure rate of 1 in 6 and can accept a no-return policy.  I figure this is worth 2 stars.  Sorry Amazon....I still love your service but this time you did not come through.
1,Sadly, the ones I received all had labels already on them and are nearly impossible to remove.  Additionally, they seem to always cross-thread though I have not had any trouble with them leaking.  (I use them to transport saltwater corals as it keeps them safe from being crushed in bags.)
1,Monoprice printers are cheap in both sense - money and quality. Stay away from this brand. If you run into trouble with the printer, good luck dealing with their customer care.
1,I've normally had good luck with eSUN filament, and I'm hoping this was just a bad batch, but this stuff is awful.  I busy so much PLA now, that I don't leave reviews unless it's unusable, and this nearly is.  Horrible bed adhesion, droopy layers, lots of breaks during printing - no matter what temperature I tried.  Not at all what I expect from eSun!  I suspect this may have been a "counterfeit" roll, as it came in a different bag, with no box. but who knows?  If I get too many more like this, eSun will go from my #2 buy for filament to being on my list of brands to avoid.
1,When it works it prints great parts, x axis belt tensioner was broken, contacted tech support, took a week for them to tell me the part was out of stock.  Takes forever to get the bed leveled with the auto calibration, might only run true for 1-2 prints and be nocked out of alignment when you remove the part, then you are stuck trying to get bed realigned for 45 minutes or longer.		bought because it was available for prime delivery, should have purchased something else.		I would recommend friends to stay away from this printer.
1,Not a true hardwood dowel. Easily deformed during fittings. Will not buy again!
1,These people are worse than useless! I received my order of 100% Pure Copper Mesh today. Upon opening the package I found the product to be heavily oxidized; far beyond any reasonable reclamation. It's so dark I don't think anything will clean it without further contaminating it. If I had known the poor quality I was to receive I would have taken the time and effort to source the mesh locally.
1,All packed in one baggy. I like my stuff individually wrapped and sterile. I'd NEVER buy these again!!
1,Surprised to find that what I got was so lacking in tensile strength.  If I put the rod on end it will quickly bend in the middle and collapse on the floor. If you want a rigid rod this is not going to work for you at all.
1,I order two packs (60 total leds) about 30% were a different shade than the rest.  Only those 30% of those were "warm white" like in the image, the others were neutral white.
1,As the heading states I have had this printer for just over 6 months. I like to stay on the side of the positives but with the deep discounts on the R1 Plus and new Advanced I think people need to know what they are getting into. I teach Mechanical Design and Prototyping. We have a very expensive M1 Carbon all the way to consumer SLA, FFM Luzbots, Ultimakers, Prusa kits and complete one off RepRap builds.	  What you save in initial costs you WILL spend on part upgrades to get satisfactory prints. If you don't wan't to read an in depth review this is my recommendation after thousands of prints for a budget printer that is reliable and WILL print well after calibration: A Genuine Prusa I3 Version 2 assembled printer. This will satisfy 95% of consumers needs and it is RELIABLE.	  Back to the ROBO 3D R1 Plus. First unit, bad power supply. Second unit was shipped with nozzle against bed and bed was cracked. Third unit, z axis was several inches up on he left and full down on the right. After several hours of attempting to calibrate the unit I gave up as the Z rods were bent. Finally, unit four came packaged correctly and nothing was broken. Calibrated the unit and here is what we have found.		PROS:	  -OK Hexagon hot end for PLA, PETG	  -Direct drive extruder	  -SD Card reader	  -Open Source Machine	  -Has 1 part cooling fan - more on that later but it's better than none	  -Heated Bed	  -Large build area		CONS:	  -Auto leveling system is HORRIBLE! Using simple micro switches leads to too much variance. The center of the bed prints layers too close and the closer the head gets to the edge it begins to lift. This is due to the weight of the X axis being used to push against the glass causing it to bend slightly when not near a mount.	  -On the same topic the bed insulator rubs on the Y axis bolt and needs to be taped tightly to the bed	  -The ned is held on with magnets and during quick movements bed will hop. You can hear it and see it in the prints. You need to slow the jerk setting but as a consumer machine most people won't know how to do that.	  -ABS printing is possible but very hit or miss. The bed heater is a poor quality unit that produces uneven heat and causes warping. Do not buy if you plan to print ABS.	  -Z rods have a slight wobble when printing above 70% of the units max height due to the lack of upper z rod supports.	  -There is no LCD display. With an SD card slot you still need a computer to print anything.	  -Nozzles are ONLY available if you ask ROBO support! Aftermarket nozzles are too pointed and not meant for this machine	  -Hot end fan is LOUD	  -With only 1 fan on the rear certain PLA prints do not print correctly	  -Printing over USB WILL cause problems. Despite using a dedicated 8 core Intel Designing desktop it still stuttered and froze at times. Same experiences when printing from a new MacBook Pro. Always save the gcode to the SD card and print from the card.		Parts that broke in 6 months:	  -Extruder stepper motor	  -1 hot end thermistor	  -Front bed magnets moved and bed could not be leveled, had to replace the entire carriage	  -Soldered connection on bed broke 2 times, bed had to be replaced	  -Right side front Y slide bearing cap cracked	  -Robo brand filaments print well but are highly overpriced		Parts that were printed, purchased or modified to make the machine print well consistently:	  -LCD control board	  -Z axis upper rod supports with bearings	  -Spool Holder	  -Complete new hot end mount with 2 fans and ducting	  -E3D V6 Hot end - huge print quality improvement		The other main part of this printer is the software. It works OK but invest in Simplify3D and learn how to use it. Your prints will turn out much better especially if they require support.		In conclusion we put endless hours calibrating, replacing parts, upgrading and troubleshooting this 3D Printer. If I didn't have a class of students working on this machine I would not have had the time to get it going this well. It is now a decent machine after $400 in parts but unless you want to spend hours tinkering and yelling at this printer save yourself the headaches and look elsewhere. Now that the C2 has been released parts are already starting to disappear! If money is no object we have had good luck with the TAZ 6. If your on a budget a genuine Prusa Gen 2 runs for about the same cost as the Robo, requires nothing additional and prints almost as well as the TAZ 6.
1,This was a gift.  I think it works well.
1,cracked 1st time out of the box, crap
1,Waaaay too thin! They cheaper out on copper big time. I don't feel putting half the Amps these are rated for
1,bottle leak , every  one i got
1,Compared to modern home AV systems, my flat panel TV/audio system is fairly primitive...an old NAD stereo receiver connected to two fairly decent speakers.  That worked fine until I bought a new TV and forgot to check that it included right and left channel audio output jacks...it didn't.  Hooking the audio output from my cable box to the stereo was a poor solution; there was significant delay between the cable box output and the picture on the screen.  Everything was out of sync by at least a quarter of a second.		This Decoder provided the solution.  Connecting to the TV's optical audio output, I was able to hook up to my old amp through the decoder and was shortly back in business.  It couldn't have been easier.  By using the TV's output, the delay between the audio and video was eliminated.  Even better, everything I now show on the TV, regardless of the input source, has the associated audio fed out through the optical connector.		A couple of reviews have commented on the reliability (or lack thereof!) of this product.  My unit does run a bit warm on the outside.  Since it's a plastic housing, which doesn't conduct the heat well, it's liable to be pretty hot on the inside.  I suspect that's the source of some of the reliability problems.  Only time will tell.		Highly recommended...at least so far...		Update - 4/22/11 - My unit did fail.  The company quickly replaced it under the warranty.  From the comments on the paperwork, it looks like there have been some engineering changes since my original unit was manufactured.  Hopefully that permanently fixes the problem.  As long as you order from a vendor that turns over its inventory, anything that you order today should incorporate the update.		Update - 6/2/11 - It died again.  Sigh.  I give up and am going to buy an A/V receiver with built-in optical inputs.  Changing this review from five down to two stars.
1,I'm sure this toothbrush is great, but I just can't stand the feel of the high-frequency vibration. It's like nails on a chalkboard for me. I gave it to my wife and she likes it but doesn't love it due to the angles you have to keep it on your teeth to work effectively.
1,Very thin with minimal adhesive strength. Will not be reordering. Very low quality to the point of being nearly useless.
1,Everything I read stated the latex caulk was user friendly. Not so. No matter how hard I squeezed the caulk would not flow. It came out in globs. I even stuck a paper clip in the hole to ensure there was not any blockage. I had to throw it away. More wasted money.
1,These connectors are sub quality, would not buy again, very disappointed, the insulators come off when you try to unplug them . Poor quality
1,did not work, this is a piece of garbage. Very disappointed as I started assembling this kit, when finish the lights turn on but no signal, not data on LCD.
1,You don't get what you pay for. I paid for 45 sanding drums and 6 drum mandrels. So far of the six drums I've tried six have failed. I have usable sanding drums (used) that came with my first moto-tool that I bought in the 1960's. Dremel sanding drums at $0.50 each would be a better buy than these drums $0.05 each. The might work on a low speed drill/tool but not on a single speed Dremel - etc..
1,magnet not strong enough to spin stir bar. waste of money
1,these terminals are not as heavy duty as those purchase from HomeDepot, although they are rated the same. Really worried about if these can hold up the same amount of electric current. Easily deformed when crimping to wires, easily loosen up after crimping. The metal material is too thin to hold the shape.
1,Really cheap little hinges
1,The product says none Harding but my did now its use less.
1,Not polished, not engraved, chipped teeth, bent teeth, crushed bulged extrusion. Honestly what I got is garbage. I should have returned them but didn't want to be bothered. Certainly not as advertised.  Hopefully others get what they paid for.  Ohh and they chew up belts like a paper shredder.
1,You better use them the day you get them, that's about how fast they dry out.
1,Not that much helpful than I expected since the depth of guide is kind of short and not really functioning as a guider.	I feel like it's kind of better than nothing but nothing more than that!
1,Needed another for my wife.  good price.
1,I LOVE THIS UNIT !, this is my first printer so I wanted something easy to start and this thing works great! cheap and clean. I have over 300 hrs on it now, with only 2 errors that reset with the on/off switch.	The Good	very easy to use and clean.		The Bad	the XYZ filament isn't that good so far, You need to use aftermarket filament for best results (search web)	The printer is a bit slow.		I would tell anyone who is starting 3d printing to get this printer! And I would buy another.
1,Not thick enough
1,I've had this printer about 6 months.  I've been through a lot with it, and I originally reviewed it a few months ago with a favorable impression - that this is a good hobby machine as long as you're willing to put in work, learn the machine, and customize it.		Now I can't recommend it.  The company (XYZPrinting) has been taking active steps with their firmware and software to block people from using 3rd party filament - honestly, one of the only things that got this printer a decent following in the first place.		Given that this is the attitude of the company, I can't recommend this printer anymore.  It's built crappily and I've already had to fix several things with it, or add modifications to get decent functionality.  And since XYZ wants to discourage that, I'd say there's very little future with this machine.		The print quality is poor, and the Z layers ripple due to what would seem to be hardware problems that can't be fixed in software (looks like the problems you get when you use a standard Z drive screw instead of a metric).
1,Several of the droppers were chipped on the tips.
1,Very cheap construction. Get broken soon.
1,I have ordered these twice about a year apart.  In total I purchased 6 units.  5 of them read within a % of each other.  One is way off...by 10 to 15%.

1,We both 2 units. First unit, install 9 volt battery and test with a known good cat-5. both number 1 and 2 lights up, then skip number 2. One would think that I have a bad wire (not true). Both returned.
1,Did not work for me cause my computer not working and can not use it on anything less it has USB, I Gabe it away.
1,These are way too thin for any use beyond human skin to skin contact.  Almost worthless in the shop for automotive or paint solvent use.
1,The fitting leaks in the middle, not at the fittings that connect it to the rest of the piping.  Kind of defeats the purpose!  Luckily the leak is small and when the season is over I will throw the thing out or request to send it back as defective.
1,These are cheaply made terminals that do not crimp well, even with a quality Greenlee ratcheting terminal crimper.
1,These are cheaply made terminals that do not crimp well, even with a quality Greenlee ratcheting terminal crimper.
1,Tried this but was very brittle that tells me it has moisture problems.
1,this velcro is actually a little weak, and inflexible for its size. I have no use for it.
1,The box and packaging arrived undamaged, but there were multiple loose screws rattling around inside the case and the circuit board was loose in the frame.  I never turned it on because of the likely short circuit.
1,Leaky
1,I'm kind of surprised these got such high star ratings. For the utility, these are going to work for me just fine. The fit and finish is what has me struggling to even give these a 2 star rating. Some pits from rust, hammer marks, polish is very poor, teeth on self locking mechanism are uneven and jagged, hinge area is sloppily constructed, and it's not really straight either. The teeth at the end don't fit snugly together because of the uneven thickness of the metal so there about a 1mm gap in some areas of the teeth. These look as if a high school student made them in metalshop. Mine have a stamp on them saying Pakistan so I assume that's where they are made.
1,IT DOES NOT ALIGN THE AREA PERFECTLY.
1,These are quite simply poorly made bottles. These bottles leak onto your hand when you squeeze the lever. This is not good if you are using  cleaning products at the time. Also, this makes a mess on the floor.		My husband decided to take one of the spray units apart to see what was wrong. It turns out that the nylon plunger and the barrel don't make a good seal. The nylon has a very uneven edge that lets liquids get by.  You can smooth the working edge of the plunger with an emery board or sandpaper if you are so inclined. It is likely that you will break the lever in the process, so why bother?		I have to chalk this one up to experience and move on. If you do buy these bottles and yours leak too.....you could give these as presents to people you don't like - if you run out of other ideas. Please don't give them to me.
1,Understood these would fit my scope. They do not. As for the quality I guess it is acceptable for the price but do not recommend.
1,Would not fix/hold together a broken piece for a stove burner grate . Attempted to repair it twice... Very Disappointed!
1,**THIS IS A OLD AND DEPRECATED PRODUCT NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY THE ARDUINO DEVELOPERS**		There are lots of incompatibilities and problems that will never be fixed. I strongly recommend using the updated V2 motor Shield.
1,Filament was undersized by about .10mm off nominal. Did not extrude well due to poor engagement with drive gear.
1,This is a piece of crap. It worked once and only once. Don't waste your money
1,Tolerances are horrible and it'll jam up pretty good in most printers.	Used on a Robo3d (with E3D v6 head), Custom RepRap (with E3D v5 head) and a MakerMini.. all jammed.	Don't have any of these issues with some other filaments.	Skip this vendor, you have been warned.
1,These are cheaply made terminals that do not crimp well, even with a quality Greenlee ratcheting terminal crimper.
1,I turned the locking lever to lock the measurement in place and the lever broke off.  I didn't use much force.  The screw on the lever screws into a thin brass tube and the tube had cracked all the way around its circumference.		Other than the lever the tool feels of good quality.  The thimble turns freely but with enough friction that your measurement doesn't shift, and nothing feels loose.  The smaller silver thimble sticks out of the end of the larger thimble has a ratchet such that as you tighten it down on what you're measuring, it will start clicking instead of turning, at which point you can take your measurement.		The gauge didn't quite read 0 when I ratcheted it closed all the way, but it did return to the same not-quite-0 point when opened all the way and closed again.  When opened to 1 inch my ruler said it was maybe 0.5 to 1mm larger than an inch, so it's not extraordinarily accurate at larger distances.		A small tool is included which can be used to change the 0 point.  The problem is that small tools are easy to lose, and it's got such a specialized shape I don't know how you could ever adjust the zero point if you lost it.		The manual say the little black plastic oval on the blue horseshoe is a "heat insulating plate".  I guess you're supposed to hold it there when reading hot things, or maybe when reading anything so the temperature of your body doesn't affect it?  The manual doesn't say, but the plastic is too small for me to hold it there without touching the metal, and I have fairly-small fingers.		The gauge reads in decimal inches with 0.001 inch markings and one full turn of the thimble equals 0.025".  I find it hard to visualize what the measurements mean because I'm so used to dealing with inches as 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, etc.  If you're used to visualizing fractional inches as well as millimeters, you might want to get a millimeter micrometer instead.  The manual is actually written with an example of reading a millimeter-scale micrometer, which really confused me until I remembered this was an inch-scale micrometer.
1,I really like the material.  Prints well when it prints.  However, I am giving it only 2 stars since I am having a terrible time printing with it.  The filament is all tangled on the spool.  This is the first brand and first time I have ever encountered a spool that is tangled on the spool and keeps ruining prints because the spool is messed up.  Very disappointed.  I have tried to fix, but keep finding more tangles.		I have other colors and spools from this manufacturer and haven't had this issue.  Must have got a bad one.  Not sure yet what I will do.  May have to stop using this one.  I can't trust it on a large print if I am not here.  If it wasn't for the messed up spool, then I would probably have given it a 5 stars.
1,This product does not function properly in my Fusion3 F400-s.		We tried multiple settings within our Simplify3D software to no avail.		No matter what we tried, even after tech support, the material simply would not feed properly. It seems to be too soft for the product to be fed into the tube that feeds the print head. The wheel simply will not grip it, no matter how tightly or loosely set.		We had high hopes for this, because we wanted to make flexible coils with it.		Sad Pandas now, money wasted.
1,I bought this to use with E-Z LOK's brass threaded inserts to attempt to install them by hand (I've been using the drill press method to make sure they go in straight) but this tool is complete garbage. The wings that are supposed to fit in the threaded insert's slot are severely undersized with way too much slop. They don't stay in the recess when attempting to install the inserts; it just slips out. Trying to use a bit more pressure when turning the inserts results in the slots breaking and rendering the insert useless.		The big problem is how undersized the wings on the bit are. If they were sized to match the insert slot they would probably work great.		So instead of this tool, I recommend the drill press method. Doing it that way ensures the inserts go in straight and without breaking.
1,The tiny plastic hole holding the motor to the wand will break eventually so that motor will not stay on the wand. Mine is broken.
1,I have used a different but similar cart for years, and the bed finally split.  I don't like one wheeled wheelbarrows, because the load is high and they are easy to tip.  I see no reason to spend any more than the $50 this one costs.		1. The floor is not flat, as my old unit was, to make it easier to mix the load with a shovel.  However, it seems that the flat plastic floor style of my old unit is not as strong as this style of plastic, and this style also makes a narrower cart, which is easier to get through some spots. Unlike the old cart, I don't see any areas that are weak by design. I figured that I should be able to get at least as many years out of this cart (5 or more).  Unfortunately I got less than 1 year.	2.  These wheels are large enough to roll easily, although not as large as my old cart.  I did not want tires that pump up--my experience with those is that eventually they don't hold air anymore. That style is expensive to replace or repair.  The wheels on the old cart are still good, and I estimate that these will be good for some years to come.	3.  The cart dumps well, and the walls are higher than most.  It lists a 200 pound capacity.  Unless you are a 27 year old weight lifter or farmer, you probably won't want to carry more than 120 pounds in a cart anyway.  It does not bend when I dump 40 pound loads at a time into it.  If you need to move more than this, buy a $250 steel and wood wheelbarrow.
1,These plugs don't seem to be made of the correct metal. I tested an extension cable made with these plugs and they were very sensitive to temperature. I would recommend going to Omega and buying similar plugs that are made with the correct alloy.
1,Similar to another buyer - my jack came missing key parts and as such is useless. The box was undamaged so it wasn't a case of something being lost in transit.
1,Terrible. Nothing but failed prints, non-adhering layers. Definite additive smell. Returned it. stay away.
1,This device was not able to work on a Win 8 pc or an android.  For android use, you need a QR scanner to grab the application. In any case, this camera did not work.
1,This works fine in a vertical position but I purchased for a specific need where it would have to be almost horizontal and it doesn't work at all there.
1,Nowhere close to gold color, this is some light brown shade.	Even quality is poor.
1,When you try to tighten them, they all bend and collapse.	So anything under 1/2in OD will be too small for the clamp.
1,Came with a lot of scale or meal or some thick rubbery film from manufacturer that kind of rubs off and gets everywhere.	For over $5 for a single rubber cork I'd expect it to be clean and cleanable.
1,Junk. A wheel will slip with this thing, and if you overtighten, it will crack or distort.	Go with Metal!!!
1,Good for random projects but it doesn't include enough variety of screws.
1,Received this unit on Nov 27th.	Very excited to be the first "kid" on the block with a 3D printer.	Unboxing and setting it up felt like Christmas had come early.  I even bought the glass build plate - to avoid the reported issues with the acrylic plate being out of true.	Printed out the Nut and Bolt test printable from the SD card. Worked great.	Printed the stretchy bracelet - again worked great.	Tried to print the little dinosaur and was good - right up until it got to the head and it looked like the poor little guy had an afro with severe bed head. Or was shot in the head. Take your pick.	Printing got progressively worse from there. Several "air prints", multiple mid print failures, etc.	after each failure I checked the build plate for level - it was.  I unloaded and reloaded filament multiple times.	Eventually the extruder would not load the filament at all.	It was completely occluded.	I went online to Makerbot support and found that I had contact support for that issue with this replicator unit.	Opened a support ticket on Nov 30 (Saturday). Did not get a response until Dec 5th (Thursday) . Granted there was a weekend in there but still I would expect something sooner than that for the amount of money laid out for this device. I also called and left voice mails on the support phone line asking for some kind of follow up. Twice. I finally got a response after sending a message via their facebook page.	So I did some more basic trouble shooting under the guidance of support and turned out I need to have the bar assembly replaced. Makerbot support shipped me a replacement assembly which I received on Dec 7th.	This is the process to replace: [...]	This is not something that everyone would want to do.	After replacing the bar assembly and getting ~5 minutes into a new stretchy bracelet I now get Heater Error #4 & Heater Error #5 messages displaying. The extruder refuses to get hot at this point and I can't unload the filament.	I called support back this morning and explained where we were at.. They suggested I disassemble the unit (again) and send them the bar assembly AND the motherboard from the bottom of the unit.	At this point I balked and said I'm not taking this apart again and removing even more components. I asked for a replacement unit to be shipped as I felt this one was defective and had done enough troubleshooting and repairs to warrant an exchange. They responded by saying that they don't have any inventory to do an exchange.	They sent me a UPS shipping label via email to have me ship this unit back for them to repair it and ship it back to me.	Expected turnaround time is 2 weeks (~12/23).	Merry Christmas.		So at this point, I am extremely disappointed with the unit and support. It has promise, and when it does work it seems to be great. 2 Stars for now.	I will post an update after I get my unit back.
1,I carefully researched before purchasing this oven. I received it promptly :) I used it for over a week. Because the inverter technology was new to me,. i thought that i was not using the oven properly., After stuggling, as i said for a week, it became clear to my husband and i that no matter what we did, the oven would cook correctly. It took over five minutes to make tea, when my old microwave oven that was larger and less powerful, lower wattage, only took 90 seconds!	I immediate called Amazon. They were GREAT! They arranged for UPS pickup the following day, Monday, at their expense. My credit card was immediate credited. The only problem we had was with UPS.	Save yourself a lot of aggravartion, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
1,Not working on Mac longer than 5 secons with PhotoBooth.
1,Rattles when turned. Wanted to return it, but decided that it would not be worth the efford and threw it away.
1,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PLA-Glow-in-the-Dark-3D-Printing-Filament-1-75-mm-4-Colors-Available/dp/B015ZZCGMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PLA Glow in the Dark 3D Printing Filament, 1.75 mm - 4 Colors Available</a>Stay away from this filament!  Bad news here.  This PLA is extremely brittle and does not hold fine details or any details of the print.  I tried various temperature settings and received the same sub-standard quality on all.  I had to take my print head apart to remove the filament.
1,Can't tighten them tight enough without them stripping out.
1,This stuff is dangerous. If you get any on your hands you will have to remove skin to get it off, to me it's not worth the continued risk so I threw mine away after the first (unfortunate) experience with it. The black stains over my hands, which no solvent would remove, even after 30 minutes of scrubbing, will have to wear off, I hope. But there should be a very clear warning about this included with each purchase, not to do so is irresponsible.
1,I will not buy this again. It seems messy and not as good as the Museum Putty. I have to keep re-setting items that come loose for no good reason.
1,I'M NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS TAPE. I USED IT TO TAPE DOWN ANOTHER TAPE AND IT CAME RIGHT UP. WHERE IS THE GORILLA; HE DIDN'T COME WITH THIS TAPE SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED--NOT THE GREAT TAPE IT SEEMS TO THINK IT IS.
1,It's a phony.
1,yes, color is great, filament quality is great, THE MATERIAL IS GOES EVERYWHEREE		when i print two things at once side by side, there is always excess clumps of plastic floating on the bed, everytime the extruder moves over space, plastic always comes out on its own. and no, this did not happen to ANY other filament im using. AND layer adhesion is TERRIBLE..		IF anyone has a solution please help T.T
1,A light breeze could almost separate this from its self.  Not impressed at all.  Ended up throwing it in a draw and will probably never use it.
1,Quality on this product has really gone downhill, they appear to be 2nds! Numbers and lines on cylinders is hit or miss, some are solid and full color, some are blotchy.		One of the boxes included in the shipment was shipped badly damaged knowingly, as there was no damage on the outside of the main box that would have accounted for the internal damage.		We are very disappointed in this product as we have been using them for years. We would not recommend this this product.
1,Backing does not release like it should.  You'll spend a lot of time peeling ripped paper.  Would not buy again.
1,Count on 50% of the bearings to be bad out of the box.  Sizing is pretty consistent. I put these on a 3d printer and they started squeaking/groaning after about a week.  Lubed the shafts and they quieted down so I suspect the bearings are failing at an incredibly rapid rate.
1,We bought this many times before, Never has the roll been smaller.	All three rolls were different in length.	Although we did not actually measure the length,	The diameter was very noticeable.	We even compared it to other unused rolls,	Two were very noticeably smaller in diameter.	This is not acceptable.
1,Warped badly.  There needs to be a disclaimer in the description stating that these plates have a good chance of not being flat.
1,Humidity level off by 11% showing less than actual humidity. Only visible during day time with strong light shining on it from right angle.
1,Signstek DS211 has been delivered without any user instruction manual in English or an internet link to it. It has INPUT and OUTPUT sockets but no cable has been supplied to feed Square wave to check the DS211 working. It is useful only to 40Vac, as only 1X1 probe has been supplied (unlike DSO201 with 1X1 and 1X10). The script reads poorly on screen (DSO201 was better). Could it improve by downloading Benf software upgrade? I have not used it so far.
1,I ordered 6 of these to make a bomb so that I could blackmail humanity for $1,000,000,000. It arrived no problem. However, I called the customer service number to find out how I could have it refined and enriched and they told me they only sold the ore. I asked if they had any suggestions at all, and the girl snaps, "Try Iran!" Are you kidding me? The cheapest flight is like $3000 round trip! You can bet I'll buy my Uranium Ore from a more customer service oriented company next time.
1,ended up not really using them
1,You want a mouth massage? Well, this is the toothbrush for you. You want some serious cleaning? You need Philips Sonicare.		There are good things of this toothbrush, but I think the disappointing things outweigh them. For one thing, the brush's head is larger than the Sonicare's. This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.		The one positive thing is the toothbrush's compactness. It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior. But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare.
1,Filament density is higher than black, requiring recalibration to go between the two. Difficult to make consistent prints due to this.
1,The packaging was huge but very safe. The product came in as expected but was low quality. It broke in its first use. I used the halves for a while until they broke as well.
1,poor quality and they drip. I purchased three of these and they all leak. Spray pattern is okay.
1,Very displeased, worked great for about 3 hours and now only works without stepper boards. Install the steppers and the unit goes dark!
1,Received my level a few days ago.	Opened the box and it looks like a nice unit. Would not power on.	No big deal, let me put a fresh battery in it. Powered up and I thought all was good. Counters are level and the readout shows 0.00 so I was happy.	Turned it off and replaced it into the little carry case.	The next day I resumed working on the project I needed the level for.. when I tried to power it up.. Nothing. The display flashed then "Err" and after a few seconds it went off.	Pulled the battery and replaced with a new one. Same thing. "Err"	So.. I got about 2 minutes use out of it. Will return it for a new one.
1,I don't think this instrument is accurate. When compared against the hydrometer, this brix meter is off about 6 brix. I have re-calibrated twice with distilled water and nothing changes: the meter is still off.
1,Very thick Nitrile gloves!	I thought I would like the thicker ones and I'd go through less.	But in the end the gloves either tore or chemicals weakened them just the same as the thinner nitrile gloves.		Not really worth the extra $ for the extra mil thickness...
1,not worth buying, made in china, the needle was broke off when i opened the package.  save your money & buy a brown& sharpe when you can afford it.
1,Thin junk with glass impurities and bubbles in the glass.  Returned it and went with Pyrex for a few more dollars and I am glad I did.
1,Miss labeled on the case - what I really got was a refractometer for Salinity - great if I had salt water aquarium... but I don't ... I make beer!!!
1,This review is for HealthyWiser pH Test Strips 0-14, Universal Strips To Test, Urine, Saliva, Water, Alkaline Diet, Pool, Hot Tub, Hydroponics, Garden Soil, Aquariums, Kombucha Tea		We are used to PH strips for body and pool so I was interested in trying a new brand. We tried these HealthWiser strips in water, 2 human mouths, urine and the pool and none of it changed at all. I will be continuing to test these as needed and I will let you know what happens.. all these people cannot be full of it, right?? Some of these things must work???  Besides that, even though the bottle and box are blasted with information, there is no info pertaining to the actual use and what all the boxes mean. Very confusing.

1,Seems to jam a lot. I got the Aero add-on to try to fix it, and it helped, but now I'm jammed again. (Seller is a good company, though)
1,This stuff is great if you don't mind having an off center hole and it being .2 to .3mm too wide of an OD.  Had to return it because it couldn't be used at all.
1,The purple filament comes out in fibers. Easy to break a print.
1,Leaks, even with new washers. I've done everything I can think of. Too bad I'm past the return window. Should have tested this sooner.
1,I'm actually really annoyed with this purchase. The title of 3oz includes the activator. You only get 1oz of glue.		You're much better off going with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Great-Planes-Pro-CA-Gift-Pack-1-oz-Each/dp/B002EZ5ZNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Great Planes Pro CA Gift Pack 1 oz Each</a>&nbsp;which includes 3oz. of CA glue and 2oz. of activator.
1,A properly installed drill bit wobbles about 1/16" off center at the tip after many reinstalls. The nose of this chuck wobbles too. The Chinese who manufactured this chuck have cheated me. The reason I gave this thing one star is because I had not the option of zero stars. This is truly some sort of revenge on American citizens. Now I'm screwed out of almost $20.
1,Not great. Terrible layer adhesion at anything lower than 210c. Even at that temp its adhesion is subpar. Good color and extrudes fine, but requires strangely high temps. I've had other Inland filament (blue) that also requires unusually high temperatures for even decent adhesion.
1,These probably would have been good shaft clamps however after one turn of the tightening screw, the thread on the clamp stripped out. The build quality just isn't that good.
1,Doesn't Stick Well
1,I have been a long time owner of this printer having mine for over 3 years during its initial release. Let me say fantasic hardware for the price back in the day, but worthless today. The software is the worst part this company spends more time making code to restrict you then they do actually improving their software. The price may be nice, but they scam you by forcing you to buy their filament. Don't bother with them, there are many other great printers these days for better prices.
1,After applying to the inside foam of my videocamera case, it destroyed my camera.
1,This came with a Nasty fingerprint which can't be removed. How hard can it be to wear gloves folks? Don't bother with this one.
1,Tried using this to get old flaking paint off of metal poles, and it just doesn't do a very good job of it.
1,Plastic package was not sealed. Right away, I am having tons of issues with moisture as the filament spurts out of the nozzle. I have bought Hatchbox PLA numerous times before and had no issues.
1,I would give it zero stars, but unfortunately there is a one star minimum rating.  I'll keep it short and sweet.  I received the printer last week, and since then, it has not been able to successfully print anything other that the 3 demos it has.  Every time it messes up any other model I try to print, either created by me or downloaded from somewhere else.  Does not matter which setting I use to print, it always ends up screwing the print up.  I contacted XYZ Support, and they told me to clean, calibrate, wait to apply the glue before printing, etc...  None of their expert advise has worked so far.  In the meantime, I keep wasting filament. I took some pictures to post, but I guess that feature is no longer available here.  Buyers beware!  It may look great, but it will drain you patience quickly.  Do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this!
1,One of the two in this package was not "all metal", it had a ptfe liner. Support did not respond to my query about this.  Both do fit my system, but...
1,Radiator fins are to compact, blocking 90% of airflow, even with use of pressure fans. I got more blowback then anything else. There is not way to mount these radiators, as there are no threads in the holes, and the rad fins prevent you from even passing through a bolt. And brand new from the box, about a dime size section of fins were completely bent over.
1,not even close to the picture if you want the brass screws that are pictured go else where there not here
1,I have tried to use these things on many occasions but I hate then. They are undependable. I prefer soldering my connections together and use shrink rap wire covers. Much neater and more dependable. If I need to frequently disconnect a circuit I use the two wire universal quick connects.
1,Not very well designed. The seals in the bearing kept falling out during installation.
1,They wear out more quickly than generic blades. Definitely won't buy again
1,Undersized sheet, warped, wouldn't adhere to print bed. Waste of time & money.		I installed this curled PEI sheet using the recommended 3M 468MP adhesive sheet.  The first time I tried to use it, the bed started to preheat and the PEI warped back off the bed at the front and back edges when the adhesive warmed and the PEI returned to its curled shape.  I removed the bed and use a brayer to roll the PEI into the adhesive and did a test reheating.  It stuck a bit better for a few minutes then rolled off the bed again in the front and back.  It's completely unusable.  I never touched the PEI with my fingers to contaminate it.  I peeled the protective sheet and immediately applied the PEI to the adhesive.  I guess I'll buy Ultem sheets from an industrial supplier that I use, for about the same price and I'm likely to get FLAT sheets of Ultem so I can hopefully avoid this wasted time and effort.  I'll also get actual 12" sheets instead of these 11.8" sheets that are so small that my 6"X9" print bed can only get one sheet out of this supposedly 12"X12" sheet of PEI.
1,These ramps will safely hold about 2500 pounds at best. I have an International Prostar that the front axle weighs 11,996 lbs fully fueled, and these things buckled and broke before even getting 1/2 up the ramps.
1,Nothing stays connected with these boards. What a pain the are.
1,Inaccurate temperatures; is always 2 to 5 degrees off. Also skips numbers, i.e., 75, 76 and 78 degrees always reads 77. This is one weird piece of crap. DO NOT purchase.
1,The tube came in a sealed package but was completely unusable. I followed the directions to open and it said to squeeze out the liquid but when I squeezed nothing came out and it felt hard inside the tube.	Amazon did issue a refund.
1,I bought this to attempt to patch a leaking hose. It was not strong enough. Every time pressure was applied, it would expand and leak. So, don't use it for patching leaks.
1,hard to apply
1,I just received my 3D print removal tool and I can confidently say that it is not worth the price. The handles are made of incredibly cheap plastic that is very dull and scratched. Also, the handles are stamped with a 4 and 17 for no apparent reason. It does an okay job of removing parts as would any other removal tool. Basically, there is nothing special about these, so don't waste your money.
1,Crap.  Doesn't work at all.
1,I had an oral b floss action brush before and it did such a better job of keeping my teeth plaque free for the whole day. By the end of the day my teeth feel gross using this toothbrush. This just vibrates and doesn't spin or move. I am just commenting on the toothbrush and not on the waterpik. Can I return a used item?
1,do not buy. waste of money. you get a tiny amount, and i wrapped the hell out of a garden hose coupling, even tried it twice, with no success.  still leaks.  so, don't expect a miracle.
1,Product quality is very good.  I have not used yet because they are not what I was expecting.  Not sure if the would leak liquids or not.
1,Perfect trade. bad product.
1,No Joy.  Attempted to glue about a 1 inch square break on a candle holder stem.  The break was fairly clean.  Applied about 2 drops of glue so the entire surface was covered and held immobile for 60 seconds and then left it undisturbed.  While it took an initial tack, when I next saw it a few minutes later the top had fallen off.
1,this product would not let go of my prints, too aggressive in my opinion...use kapton tap instead
1,Changed out 4 nozzles thinking my printer was not working properly. Decided to try a different old filament worked great. This one clogs noodles like crazy!
1,Horrible. They all look the same in and out of acidic substances. Didn't work. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Get the good, little more expensive strips.
1,Wasn't able to use because it wasn't exactly the color I needed but that was my fault.  The packaging says 3M, but it sure doesn't look and feel like the 3M quality I'm use to.  I did try a small piece of it and it seemed to tear very easy which made me question the durability.
1,I have purchased this brand in the past with good results. However, this new batch should be avoided. Prints do not bind well and crumble apart when you pick them up. At first I thought it was something with my printer or software. But using a different filament yielded a perfect print. I will be returning this.
1,Not what I expected. I can do better with small needle nose pliers.
1,These are flawed and make some claims on the label that are far from true. 12000 bs capacity actually means 3000 lbs per ramp, the idea being that the vehicle weight is split exactly 25% on each tire while it's on the ramps at an incline, which is not realistic. "Stronger than steel" they are surely  not. They do fine if you try getting a 4x4 or a FWD on them, if you have  RWD car they just slide out on concrete, there is barely any padding on the bottom. The heaviest vehicle I used these one was 5300lbs and the ramps started bulging out and bending, temperature was around 105 so that might have been the factor.
1,Not impressed. First of all, it doesn't come with any kind of "spout" or applicator where the nozzle can be cut down to apply a small bead of glue. Your only option is the size of glue bead that comes directly from under the cap, which is large. Did not suit my purpose at all, and it ended up being a big mess.		Second, the setup time is really quick. Work in small areas with this stuff or it will be setup before you can smooth out the bead.		It smells like silicone, and my guess it is nothing but a fast-set silicone. I will not use again.
1,Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever.
1,If you hook these up wrong for one second, they will burn out.
1,First disk I used ended up grenading on me.  I hope the other 9 aren't as poor quality.
1,Crap plastic. Does not bond well. Does not stick to bed at all except with think acetone slurry. Leaves flakes and particles of itself everywhere. My bowden tube is still pumping out yellow dust into my extruder thanks to this. Stay away from Octave.
1,It is very tricky to perform the test. i could never find out how it really works. They need to find out a simpler method /equipment for this kind of test.
1,Used this twice and then it simply stopped working - it simply would not turn on.  I would have returned it, but it was outside the Amazon return period.  Cannot recommend.
1,While Hatchbox is normally very good...the roll of gold I got had jamming problems in 3 different printers....but...I've found no gold has every worked well EXCEPT for Zen's (and they changed the dang color of it last year)		If you're really wanting some gold I would suggest some ultra premium stuff...most of the mid grade stuff (from any manufacturer) has problems...		AND...I do like Hatchbox...I've used the other PLA's and ABS with great success...
1,Looks like it's made from recycled rags. You could not find lower quality material if you tried. It is knitted. The elastic edge keeps it on the mattress well enough.
1,Had issues with this roll. Only had it 2 weeks and began to get brittle with every run. Had to discard 3/4 of the roll. I always keep all my PLA in sealed bags with moisture packs when not running jobs.
1,Every tube that I have used so far were filled with more air (60%) than glue (40%).
1,no instructions which screw is intended for where, the spring seems a little short like it doesn't belong or something.
1,Impossible to install straight. Cheap.
1,This gauge is terrible. It's foil faced bezel is just glued on. Mine has peeled off and the accuracy is not even close. Nothing is better then an analogue gauge and if you use a schrader valve. just get an adapter. This has the ability to test both, but I wouldn't trust it on my bicycle if I was going for a long ride.
1,Not  well made	Easy to use	Not heavy duty	Easy to install	Great product but don't last	It is not working well
1,TOO MANY LARGE PINS..  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.  $ WAS RIGHT. PLASTIC BOX CHEAPLY MADE FO TH WEIGHT OF PINS.  MY MISTAKE ON THIS PURCHASE.  MORE JUNK FOR THE GARAGE.  ,MAY BE OF USE FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS, NOT ME.
1,Latest software version 3.5 software has got bugs. company technical support is less than stellar.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bbTHWIyhoc
1,Would not thread properly, I had to buy a different one from another seller that worked correctly.
1,Upon receiving this Variac I opened the box took it out all looked good, Then I plugged it in with no load on it, and the light show started, meaning when the wiper got to the 10 volt range, it started arcing like a dead short, and it caused the lights in my shop to dim. the sparks that shot	out could have started a fire.	This "Variac" is garbage cheap unsafe junk, this variac should not be sold on amazon or any where else.	for all you amazonians out there do not buy this junk it is unsafe. I do understand that we the purchasers try to find	I know that this review will be placed at the bottom of the reviews list, but it should be at the top, to warn other purchasers to avoid this unsafe item.
1,I'm disappointed in this kit. The big box is impressive, but when you open it up, you get mostly empty space. As you can see in the photos, you do get small quantities of several different types of tapes. Small quantities of tapes are hard to find in stores, which is a plus, but these products are so inexpensive to manufacture, why didn't they just give you bigger quantities? They could have tripled the quantities and still fit them in the box and still made a healthy profit. I could see selling this sampler kit for $5 in simpler packaging, but $35 is ridiculous .
1,I needed a full-metal hot-end to print ABS or Nylon at high temperatures and don't worry about PTFE tubing issues. And also wanted to save some money on original V6 which is way overpriced (I don't see any tremendous engineering investments in a such simple thing).		It has two issues!		First and the BIG ONE, which makes this hot-end completely non-functional:	The heatbreak in this clone is drilled to deep, so the plastic gets melted in a wider diameter area - above (before) the throat.  So kinda a melted ball of wider diameter gets formed then the filament and the heartbreak throat . Then on the first retraction it gets cooled, hardens a bit and blocks the filament to go any further. So, to make this cheap clone working I had to get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/a-correctly-designed-heartbreak/dp/B01F82BMI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">a correctly designed heartbreak</a>&nbsp;(another cloned part, but correct one).		The second issue is not that big:	The 30mm fan bearing got dead after some 20 hours of work, it produces terrible noise when the printer gets turned on until it spins a little to warm-up then in 5 min it turn into less annoying but still loud buzzing.		Two star is just for the price which I thing is really good for the parts you get all together (including bowden tubing and fittings)
1,I'm sorry, but why is everyone so happy about this? It's $8 for an LDR (Light dependent resistor)	Is it the pretty oversized container it comes in? Because below is a link for a 20 pack for the same price.		http://www.amazon.com/20PCS-Photoresistor-GL5537-Resistors-Light-Dependen/dp/B008QVE9BG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391809965&sr=8-1&keywords=light+dependent+resistor
1,Since I purchased both this and the Eva-Dry I will use this review to compare the two.  This pales in comparison to the Eva-Dry E-333.  If money or space is super tight maybe this is a good option but otherwise the Eva-Dry is superior in every way except that it takes up more space (it's about 6"x6"x1.5").		Reasons:		It holds 100g of silica gel		It has a heating unit that dries it out by plugging it into the wall vs baking in an oven for hours		It has a hanger attachment		The window is easy to see the color of the silica - This unit I could barely see through the dark window to see the color		The construction is much better - This one was almost separating at the edges and pink fluid was leeching out of the sides onto a paper towel once it was full
1,In my opinion, these gloves are terrible. I bought them to work on my car and other light chemical work. These things constantly tear time and time again. When you try and put on a new glove after a tear it is pretty much impossible since these are not powdered and run small. The moisture on your hands keeps the glove from going on smoothly and you have to wait a minute or two for your hands to dry to put on a new glove. Maybe I got a bad batch, I don't know. I was tearing gloves just trying to put them on.		The gloves fit great and have great tactile feedback so that is a plus but I won't be buying these again anytime soon. If you are a home mechanic then I would look at a different glove. If it is other light work such as wood work, painting and staining then these will probably work well.
1,I have grouted before. I followed the product directions to the letter. Made sure the applied gout cured for over 72 hours. One week later and the grout is coming off. Very disappointing as I spent several hours applying the grout and was unable to use the primary bathroom for 3 days. Now I have to do the work all over again. This time I will use standard grout.
1,Bought this to drill a couple of holes in some small gauge sheet metal (24 ga) and the bit lasted for 3 holes until it was completely dull. It started to melt the metal and bend it and stopped cutting, even though this is advertised to work fine on metals like that.
1,Pretty good!
1,Shattered on the first use....
1,The filament itself prints very well however towards the middle of the roll the diameter was anywhere from 1.8mm to 1.6m causing issues in the final print. I will not be buying their filament again as I ended up wasting about 1/5th of the roll because I had to re-print the parts I was printing with it.
1,returned did not fit
1,Overpriced. Doesn't use standard batteries but button cells. About twice what it should cost. Klein should be ashamed.
1,This product should remove made in usa label. It is total garbage and in fact I highly doubt it is een true. Bought another blue one on amazon different brand, chinese brand and its much better for same price. Dont bother with this one.
1,Manufacturer didn't include the handle. Nor did they include any information on how to contact them. As usual, Amazon is useless and will only let you return the entire thing.
1,This is by far the worse petg filament I have bought from hatchbox, their abs is perfect, and inland's petg is perfect as well.	But this has a lot of moisture in it, and the actual filament line is kinked in spots.
1,Good printer.  Scanner is complete and total crap.
1,Product was likely over shelf life.  Would have returned but it wasn't enough money.  Vendor likely was unaware the product had problems....
1,there is no instructions on how to put this heavy vacuum cleaner together ... I will have to pay a handyman to put it together for me.	I thought it would be lightweight to haul up and down my spiral staircase , the parts are all very heavy
1,Lasted only about a year before the spring that pushes the plunger gave out.  It was great while it lasted.  Spring broke while it was sitting on the shelf.
1,Had one of the three defective, won't return a valid temp, even though I can see it on the bus.  All of the money I paid was 100% top quality.		Cannot be bothered to return them, I already used the other two.
1,With a one ampere load it read 1.875 amperes, calibration trim had no effect. (at 320ma it read 497ma) I returned it for a replacement and hope I'll have better luck with the next one.	 I like the the fact that this meter has screw terminal for connecting large (14AWG?) cables for the current carrying circuit.	I like the independent powered operation.	I would have loved the three decimal (ma) readout and also the ability to monitor up to 10A loads.	UPDATE 09/12/15	Amazon didn't get the replacement to me before they had received the return item. I returned it also. Prime, free (prepaid) two day shipping on returns, but not on replacement.
1,If you get it in "just the right light", you can actually read the inscriptions!!!
1,So I buy the 5 foot high lift jack. And of course I want the accessories, so I bought this wonderful item to give it a larger footprint. The picture shows it attached to the Jack neatly and they actually brag about it by including it in bold print!		When it arrives, there's a big wraparound cardboard piece that Says "A center hole is drilled through the platform so that you can attach it to the Jack!!!"  And they show a big color picture that covers the vast majority of this cardboard insert around the Jack because they are proud of this. Then in small print, it says "hardware not included..."		You have got to be kidding me? Are you serious? What is this hardware we speak of? A 24 karat gold nugget? Made out of diamonds perhaps? Maybe platinum? No no no, it's a simple $1 BOLT AND WING NUT. That's right ladies and gentlemen, they were too cheap to supply a stupid little small bolt and wing nut to attach it to the stand!!!		Just utterly ridiculous and being cheap beyond my comprehension. Nuts and bolts in our days cost what? $.50? You mean to tell me you can't supply a stinking little bolt with a wing nut?		SHAME ON YOU, JUST SHAME ON YOU. GO HIDE YOUR HEAD IN THE DIRT LIKE AN OSTRICH.
1,Edit Feb 6 2017		OK, Second one of these just died. I haven't put a half-spool of filament through my 3d printer, which I have been trying to use these as Z-Probes for autoleveling and no had two start flaking out with WILDLY inconsistent performance, then just close the sensor circuit and not sense anymore.	These just do NOT stand up to the accelerations the printer head goes through - I guess it is zero coincidence that similarly rated probes from Mouser cost over $100.. It's like these are seconds or rejects.
1,Pile of garbage.  Focal distance is unusably short, like one inch away.  What are you going to work on at one inch from your face.  The manufacturing quality is awful, the whole thing is just junk.  Buy something else instead.
1,makes a mess, takes to long to harden.	would not buy it again.
1,I ordered the 1.25" x 500 pieces but received the 2.5" x 50 pieces, I need what i ordered
1,BIG difference between Electro Static Discharge E.S.D. and Electro Magnetic Pulse!!! Static discharge protection  isn't going to save your precious electronics if god forbid there is ever a true EMP attack. This is just an anti static bag that you get when purchasing a circuit board or mother board. Folks are feeding on your fears. Put your cell phone in a cardboard box and then wrap the box in 3 layers of thick aluminum foil then tape all seams. Then do your cell phone or walkie talkie test!!! Better yet just buy a galvanized garbage can,then line it with something non conductive like cardboard or rubber. Throw all of your electronics inside. Make sure the metal lid makes contact with the entire rim of the can. Seal the lid  to the side of the can all the way around with aluminum tape. Now your ready for Armageddon!
1,There is nothing 'right' about this device....the 5 stars , we'll...no idea what they are thinking.		Doesn't tighten properly		Heavily plastic		Ballpoint won't stay put		Rubber slides around out of place under any pressure		It is simply awful , do not buy this....please.
1,these terminals are not as heavy duty as those purchase from HomeDepot, although they are rated the same. Really worried about if these can hold up the same amount of electric current. Easily deformed when crimping to wires, easily loosen up after crimping. The metal material is too thin to hold the shape.
1,We bought this to use for home brewing, cider, mead, etc., but every time I measure any batch, of any liquid that should have an alcohol content it reads .99.  Mead, .99, cider .99, 40 proof rum .99.  I would look for another brand, I don't trust the thing~  It is packed well, I got a hydrometer tube to do accurate readings, I've waited 2 months and the batches never change, then I tried it with a known item, store bought rum with a tested and listed alcohol content, measured the same as everything else.  Disappointed
1,These don't seem to fit on my drill bits very well.
1,junk, flimsy metal frame, motor had big problems right out of the box, wouldnt spin without help, then only turned very slow. get what ya pay for i guess.
1,Horrible product arrived broken replacement was broken also I would look elsewhere you might get a good one but then again you might get two bad ones like I did not worth the hassle
1,I haven't used these headers yet, but I'm sure they work fine.		But, please see the attached photograph of how the headers arrived.		I'm not a tree-hugger, but I think reasonable person would find this to be ridiculous.
1,First, I will say that this is the first and only PLA filament I have ever tried, so I do not know if it is specifically this PLA or just PLA in general that is horrible. I've printed hundreds of hours in ABS for almost a year now and not a single clog or jam. I've tried over a dozen prints with this PLA in the last couple of weeks, and all have failed because the nozzle would eventually jam. After each jam I would adjust the temperature and speed settings trying to find a combination that worked. Prints would usually start out looking great, but the nozzle would jam on every single one. Most jams would be easily dislodged, but currently I have one that I can not remove. I am to the point that I am most likely going to have to purchase a new $100 extruder for my printer. I will never use PLA in my printer again.		In all fairness, I will say that I have used this SainSmart brand in ABS and have never had a problem and will continue to use their brand of ABS if I ever get my printer working again. I will never use this or any brand of PLA again though. I wanted to try it because I've heard it doesn't warp/shrink as bad as ABS, but if all PLA is as prone to jamming as this spool was, it is not worth the hassle.
1,I purchased this printer from the compnay only a few weeks ago. I have to say it has worked ok, but not for the price level it is at.		The printer is pretty. It fits perfectly on my desk. The fact the filament fits into the receticles on the side is a plus, as it cuts down on the maount of filament spools I have to mount. The print quality is average. I have not tried it at 70 microns yet, but 200 is comparable to all the others I have worked with.		The wifi card inside will not connect to my Comcast Business class router. The company syas it is because the card is a 802.11b card, and my router is an N. Doesn't make much sense since I confirmed my router is a b/g/n router, but none the less they said only to use the AD HOC feature, which is a fail on their part.		The filament is incredibly expensive. I ordered some this week. I loaded it Thursday afternoon and started a print (Frankenstein light switch plate). With a normal filament spool I get from a 3rd party, I can do about 20 per spool. But here, I was only able to get 6 prints done before it was reporting that the spool was out of filament. That translates to about $10 of filament per print, which is insane. But you have no other options. The filament has to be in the proprietary holder and attached.		This printer is a good printer for someone looking for an easy to use printer that they are going to use sparingly, that is if you don't mind the price tag. There are other printers at the same price range that accept 3rd party filament and do as good a print job as this. I would avoid this printer if you are looking for something on the "prosumer" level and doing a small business from it.
1,these terminals are not as heavy duty as those purchase from HomeDepot, although they are rated the same. Really worried about if these can hold up the same amount of electric current. Easily deformed when crimping to wires, easily loosen up after crimping. The metal material is too thin to hold the shape.
1,One side arrived warped and when placed in vice it did not stick. When I tightened vice in an attempt to straighten the magnets fell out from both sides. Set pieces aside will attempt to glue magnets back on as material seems to be pretty good. Dissappointed
1,Inaccurate O.D. 1/32" to large. Had to return.	Packaging was good.
1,This is a nice assortment, with a decent overall quantity for the price (I paid <$14 for it). My biggest issue is that this filament seems to expand slightly while being heated. I'm using it with a 3D pen, and each and every time after I stop the pen, about .75" slowly extrudes from the tip accompanied by a popping sound (see picture). I confirmed it happening with 5 of 5 colors I have used so far. I went back to the samples included in the pen kit and they did not have the same issue. The actual waste is minimal, as it's not 3/4" of the stock material, but of the reduced diameter of the nozzel, but it is annoying and adds time to the process. I will probably try another manufacturer if I can find a similar price.
1,This vacuum has two strikes against it:		* Bags: Vacuum bags are a hassle. They're a bummer to change and it's a drag trying to find replacements that work with your unit. To me, bags are a throwback to bygone days. While there are a lot of things that I loved about the simplicity of yesteryear, I won't ever forget how much vacuum bags suck.		* Canister: Canister vacuums take two hands to operate. This feels so unnecessary to me, especially since good upright vacuums are so ubiquitous. Using a canister vac seems like an additional step backwards.		If you can look past the bags and the canister style, this is an OK vacuum. It has decent sucking power and the wand is handy enough. The one great thing about the wand over an upright is that the wand is already in your hand, so there really isn't any excuse to poke the wand down in the couch cushions and suck out the couch-crumblies that our kids and dirty visitors seem to leave behind.		This vacuum truly isn't even close to my favorite, but it's a decent device for limited budgets and small floor plans. Just remember to stock up on replacement bags before the holidays, because the bags are really only good for one Christmas tree's worth of needles.
1,This toothpaste is like brushing with water, it does not foam up at all like others would and it does not leave my teeth feeling clean. I'll use what I have but I will not be buying it again. I've used better organic toothpastes.
1,Second time I've bought this stuff.  Does a good job and there's twice the quantity of other epoxy putties  I use it for all kinds of different things.  Makes good hole filler, sticks very well, dries hard as can be but remains sandable.		However it just dropped from 5 stars to two when it jumped within one month from $5.83 to $14+ tax.  That's more than a 200% price hike and difficult to justify.  It brings it from the most reasonably priced product-- to one of the most expensive (with equal quality and less pricey brands on the market).  I have to question what warrants such a price hike.  When that happens I start shopping for alternatives.
1,We bought an Irobot vacuum last year and it was so good that we bought 2 more, one for each grown daughter.  We all still love those.  The success of the vacuum cleaner bots spurred us on to buy the mop bot while ignoring the bad reviews.  Almost all of the bad reviews we subsequently read happened on this one bot.  It has a terrible time connecting with the "navigation system".  Even on the rare occasion when we could get it to connect, it would not connect in the mop mode without first connecting in the sweep mode and then turning it off and on and back to the mop mode.  Most of the time when it ran into something it would end up going round and round in counterclockwise backward circles.  Eventually it would fail and give the signal that the space it was cleaning was too small!  Duh!  That'll happen when you run in tight, backward circles.  I really hope that Irobot gets this thing perfected and working as well as the vacuum bots.  I am surprised that that would sell such an imperfect item that besmirches their good reputation.  Maybe the ones made on Tuesday afternoon work!
1,Small reel arrived in an unsealed package with no desiccant. Did not print well out of the box. Buy Hatchbox or similar PLA and skip MakerBot.
1,Well, I ran it with the Carbon filter for probably 4 months 24/7, recently I took off the Carbon filter and am just using it to exhaust hot air. I HAVE OWNED THIS FOR 5 MONTHS AND IT HAS ALREADY STARTED TO DEVELOP THE DEATH RATTLE, for now the rattling noise is very faint but I assume it to be the bearings going out as it comes and goes... hopefully I can get it to last at least another 4 or 5 months, what a waste of money.
1,I purchased this thermometer and tested it when I received it.  Worked fine, seemed to be pretty accurate.  I then put it in a drawer until I needed it again.  About about a month, I retrieved said device and it would not turn on.  The battery tested good and I tried a brand new battery in it.  Still no luck.		I contacted HDE about this issue and this is their response:		"Hello,		Thank you for contacting HDE. Unfortunately our return policy is the only warranty for this item. Unfortunately we will not be able to assist with a replacement/refund.		Thank you		HDE"		So, now I have a paperweight that used to take temperatures.  You may be luckier than I.  Caveat emptor.
1,Handle welding broke after a couple uses.
1,The worst PLA filament I've ever used.  I had a few decent prints from it, but everything else failed.  I adjusted software settings and hardware settings multiple times, but I just could never get great prints from it.  I have nothing good to say about this filament.
1,They claim great support and there is none at all!
1,Proprietary filament for a horrible printer that leaves you with 20-30m left on the roll that you *cannot* use to print with. Horrible design and the filament quality is sub-par to boot.
1,to small
1,do not buy. waste of money. you get a tiny amount, and i wrapped the hell out of a garden hose coupling, even tried it twice, with no success.  still leaks.  so, don't expect a miracle.
1,The endoscope worked well and still does however when recovering the cable detached from the shell. The gluing is not proper and I where able to reconnect it. Still working but not watertight anymore.
1,I put my iPhone in one of these bags and sealed it and there was zero effect on my bluetooth device - the audio just kept going like nothing had happened.  The purpose of this "EMP" shielding is to isolate the device and it's a waste of money as far as I'm concerned.
1,Before you purchase this product know that it -WILL- take years off your machine.  The material is highly abrasive and is the equivalent of running sand paper through your machine.		I have an all metal hot end and use hardened steel nozzles.  After 3 prints it still has filed down both to a point where I've had to replace them.		Now, Proto-pasta makes EXCEPTIONAL filament.  However this particular product is just too strong for anything but serious commercial grade printers.  Large prints are just dangerous for your machine.		Check out their wood or stainless steel filament instead.  Great exotic material that's won't destroy your machine.
1,I purchased this product because I wanted to make a 5 megaton bomb to impress my neighbors at our fourth of July barbecue.  Unfortunately, when all was said and done, I was embarrassed when the yield was less than 500 kt.  No birds on fire, no boiling rivers, nothing.		I want my money back!
1,The bag this came in wasn't vacuum sealed like most filament bags, and immediately when switching to this filament I get popping sounds from moister. It prints, but because of the moister it's ruining my parts. And as a note, it says it needs a hotend of 250-255; but it works from 240 to 265 with no noticeable differences.
1,I wanted to upgrade to a larger, 3L flask for making larger yeast starters for home brewing.  The flask arrived in fair condition, unbroken.  However, with numerous scratches and a couple bubbles in the glass, I'm going to assume that these flasks are factory culls from China, sold at discount prices.		I tested the flask with some water on my stir plate and found that the raised shape of the bottom prevented the spin bar from staying in place.  It took only a few seconds before the spin bar was thrown to the side.  Regardless of what speed I set the stir plate, the bar would quickly fling off the center.  That makes it unusable for use on a stir plate.		The flask is being relegated to other tasks, such as mixing ingredients.  But due to all the scratches and bubbles, I am hesitant to attempt heating anything in it.  I really don't want to be showered with glass shards.  In the end, a rather expensive bottle.  I will spend the extra $$$ and buy Pyrex or Kimax brand in the future.
1,cheap and dirty - not in a good way.
1,The spool is wound so tight, the printer can not continue to pull the material out of the cartridge.  It's takes a good hard pull to get some material out by hand.  I don't mind the cartridge idea, but they have got to get this issue fixed. I have 3 cartridges and 2 (Natural color and this yellow one) have this problem.
1,Item arrived with cracked case. Jack too heavy for flimsy molded plastic case. Threads on release valve  leaking oil , had to tape with hydraulic tape. Cheap price but not the best quality.
1,there is only one type of 5/16. pretty much useless.
1,poor quality
1,Checked against three other gauges for accuracy at 10 psi the gauge read 17. Consistent error made me remove needle and reset it to zero, but haven't checked it again. When received the faceplate mounting screws were loose and one of them was laying in the bottom of the plastic lens. Plastic housing, internal bourbon(sp) tube appeared to be OK but I wouldn't purchase another from this Zen-Tek manufacturer.
1,This test is fairly easy to use and understand. You pee into a cup and dip the end of the strip in it for 10 seconds. After you wait 5 minutes you check the test. The line that tells you the test worked always showed up very dark. The line that tells you if your positive or negative is not.		I don't like that the line for positive or negative was either invisible or barely visible. I took the tests every week for months and could not see any difference in the positive or negative line. The first 6 weeks I saw nothing. After that I started to see a bit of red on the right side of the line. According to the test anything means you are negative, but this test is not very reassuring. This test should have a better and more visible reading.		If you have a test that will decide your employment or your freedom I would not trust this test. Not using for months is the only way that I know I am clean and this test did not help me at all. The main reason I bought this test was to have some idea of when I would be clean to find new employment. It told me nothing and I still had to wait it out and let time take it's course.		Overall I would consider this test a waste of money and if you need to pass a test the best thing to do is quit smoking.
1,Those are fake DS18B20 sensor sold by "Fun DIY", VDD and GND shorted, heat up to very hot in seconds where it burns your fingers, the label said DS18B20, but it's just a generic NPN transistor, looks like same fake cheap item they sell on Ebay.  Requested for return and refund from Amazon.
1,Too small for my needs.
1,Update: Due to cheap connectors on the board, I have almost had a fire on my hands twice. The first time was the main power connector where the power supply feeds the control board. Smelled burning electronics and found the terminal connectors charred black and smoking. I was able to turn off power before it was too much of a problem and replace the connector with a higher quality one. In hind sight I probably should have replaced them all because today the same thing happened only with the connector to the heated bed. I fully understand trying to keep costs down, but these should really be higher quality connectors. The printer was only running at 205c on the nozzle and 60c on the beds both times this has happened. For this I am further reducing my rating to 1 star. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for an affordable printer.		Original: And buy a better version of the i3. I own the Migbot Prusa i3 and it works phenominally once you put in the time to calibrate it and straighten out minor hardware problems.  I bought this one as a secondary so I can print more but so far ive had nothing but problems.		Problems:	1. Nozzle has a hard time reaching its target temp, and sometimes never will reach it. I assume that this is a problem with the PID or the thermistor.  The thermistor does not have any kind of set screw in the heat block, meaning it kind of just sits freely in a hole so it is not getting proper contact and could therefore be causing my issues.  Additionally, I can not find Alunar's firmware online to modify the PID settings and I do not want to build a version of Marlin from scratch.	2. The Z axis limit switch has a lot of play (2-3 mm).  What I mean is that sometimes when the carriage homes the switch does not activate until it is fully pressed, however, other times the switch activates at about 50% press which is a couple mm difference and has so far made calibrating the bed height nearly impossible. This may be solved with a new limit switch but I think I will be taking the plunge and adding an inductive proximity sensor to replace the limit switch.	3. The firmware/lcd combo is horrible. It is clunky, hard to navigate, and painfully laggy.  In addition when trying to select a file to print, it scrolls long file names, which wouldn't be bad, except it also scrolls the cursor off the screen so you cant tell what file you are printing. I know it seems like I'm nitpicking at this point, but after using it a few times you will be grinding your teeth in frustration.	4. Although so far it hasn't been a crippling issue, the 3d printed parts for the carriage were poorly printed (probably printed using a stock version of this).	5. The stepper belts are not like the ones you normally would buy, these are made of a stiffer rubber which makes them hard to tension correctly and makes them prone to skipping when the carriages are near their limits.		Overall, most of the hardware on this printer is fine. I will note that it runs much quieter than its migbot counterpart; however, sound doesn't make much of a difference if the printer doesn't work. Ultimately, I am confident I can get this printer running well after i buy a proximity sensor, some new GT2 belt, and a new heater block. Plus, I will probably end up customizing a version of Marlin for it, although I am apprehensive to do so as I have said I cannot find the stock firmware to go back to if something goes wrong.  Just do yourself a favor and spend an extra 50 bucks or so on a better kit, otherwise you will pay back that 50 bucks in new parts and headaches. Especially if you are new to 3d printers, as I would not have any clue where to start fixing this thing if I didn't have the experience I gained from my other printer.
1,At the price of $21.98 when I bought this (January 2015) it was a good deal. However at the current price $22.99.		2018, January Update: When you get down to the inside winds of this filament it is wound so tight in a small circle that it wants to break just sitting on the spool. The spool should really have a bigger center hole to avoid this issue. Also I have noticed Hatchbox filament tends to get very brittle like dry spaghetti I have had a third of a roll shatter in to little pieces due to the brittleness and the too-tight winding.
1,Too thick compared to Starbrite.  Impossible to get an even coating and difficult to get a continuous coating.  I have plenty left over, but buying a can of the Starbrite version because i am not satisfied with this.
1,I didn't expect much but this still managed to be a disappointment. The chip gets extremely hot very quickly after applying power. Despite the heat, it doesn't put out very much sound.
1,New review after using it for over a year:	It's not accurate. I have it right next to a more accurate and precise humidity monitor and this one is up to 6% off. Pay the extra few dollars and get one that does what it's supposed to.		Original review when I first got it:	Very helpful and easy to set up and use. Clear, large, easy to read data give me exactly what I need. I like how it has the highs and lows for the last 48 hours too.
1,I have had great luck with uxcell before but these bearings are awful. One of them doesn't even fit on my 6mm rod.
1,Useless, I needed something to remove adhesive from the back of a magnet stuck to my phone. This stuff didn't even create the slightest movement
1,I had this microwave one time this modelI hated it it did not cook the food right.the food never was hot or warmI finally gave it to Goodwilland it was so heavy to I do not recommend this microwave it's a piece of junk buy a Sharp microwave instead they are the best.
1,1/4 inch all 20 no 28. Contacted seller but only got partial	reply. So I got a lot of 1/4 20's and no 1/4 28's. OK quality	for price just want to use another seller.
1,I have a few of these and I intended to used them for multiple purposes. Once for gas.....not good,and once for water.....also not good. Not a chance in hell these work like they should. I got a few cheap and thats probably why. One set came with a coupler to join extention hoses to it but of course it simply popped out and not worth the effort. If I could meaure the amount of liquid that they "filtered" I would say about 1 gallon in 5 hours. I know what I'm doing but you can't make a crummy product work if it's designed poorly.
1,This is the worst super glue I have ever used.  It has absolutely no adhesive strength at all.
1,I bought two of these , one stop working after 7 hours
1,Jam after jam.. QA on these aren't very good.. tight winding and the tolerances were very much off.	Returning and never buying again.. beware, especially if using E3D as it will jam up nicely in the feed channel.
1,I could not get this to control my cooling fan.  I have a 240 volt version of this and it works well, could not get this one to function properly.
1,These are okay for the price, but both plastic handles came loose after use.  The metal ferrule moved away from the handle, and then when pulling a print off (ABS stuck to the board), the handled pulled off the metal part.  I'm sure epoxy between the plastic and metal would hold everything together.
1,Amazon deletes what matters anyway!
1,brittle and turns white with acetone. overpriced
1,This stuff is kinda bad quality. Got it during the Buy one Get 2 free deal, This filament does not like any type of retraction or else it will jam up failing the print. I was hopping for better results.
1,it would not work right out of the package had to return it
1,I kept a few of these in my garage drawer, and they seemed like a good idea. However, even with the cap on, all three have	completetly dried out after a few months, and no way to refill the reservoir.	Back to the spray version and Q-tips! I won't be buying anymore of these.	I gave 2 stars only because initially, they are convenient, otherwise would have been only 1.
1,Nice looking scissors but quality control for them is nonexistent. The blade cutting edges don't mesh and they leave a 1/2" (12.7 mm) gap at the tip where cutting is impossible. On the curved side the scissors are etched with "Germany Stainless" however, a magnet sticks to them so the stainless is of poor quality  and the scissors will probable rust. German steel is usually highly desirable so I think the etching on the scissors may be counterfeited so that a higher price can be demanded. I can't understand how this item has such a high rating. One star is too high.
1,I open the box and find a warranty card that says, among other things, "Blown right side gauge is not a warranted item and does not effect Performance (sic) of unit -- read and follow installation instructions (all of this is highlighted in yellow; the latter part about following instructions is underlined for emphasis.		I have no clue what that means. There are no instructions in the box. The company has a six-month warranty except on a certain part--which part exactly, I'm not clear on.		Any company that says they will only warranty part of the product, which comes as a single unit, and says part of it is "blown" is either just stupid or disreputable.		I'm going to send this one back. I just don't trust it or the company.
1,I can't see this pan lasting as long as the one I bought a year and a half ago.  The metal is much thinner, the coating appears thinner and the skillet won't sit level on my gas range because it is handle heavy.  T-fal used to be my "go-to" skillets.  The 8 inch one  gets used 2-3x a day.  I wish I wouldn't have tossed my old black one out so I could show you the difference.  The new one is cheap feeling and for a few more dollars, I should have bought a better brand, but didn't realize how low quality these had become.  Just glad I didn't buy the matching larger sizes. I do like the color and the cool grip handle or I wouldn't give this any stars.  Sorry..
1,Poor quality but can't expect much for the money. 1/3 of the terminal screws were stripped out of the threads.
1,Purchased this device to use alongside a Caliber III digital hygrometer for the purpose of dialing in the humidity setting on our Frigidaire FAD704DWD dehumidifier.  The humidistats on the Frigidaire and many other dehumidifiers are notoriously inconsistent and by having a couple of independent sources of info as to the RH in the room, I am able to more accurately establish an appropriate setting (regardless of the skewed number that may be displayed on the dehumidifier).		Unfortunately, after close monitoring over a period of several days, it appears that the AcuRite consistently reads 5% or so below the actual room RH based upon readings from other devices.  The temperature reading was (usually) within a degree (Farenheit) of the other devices but it was the RH that I was after.		Sending this unit back for replacement.  If the replacement fares no better, I will return and request a refund.  (Will update this review upon testing.)		UPDATE:		Received second unit and it proved to be less accurate than the one it was to replace.  Returned for refund.
1,Received in a bag and no box. I was okay with that, but it did not appear to be sealed (vacuum packed). A nice color of yellow, but not "translucent". I was also very hard to print, and took hours to get things right with temps and speeds. Usually I do not have to worry about adjusting speeds when switching between different PLA filaments, but I had to slow this one down big time on the first layer. After that I was good. Anyone having sticking issues reduce that first layer speed on this filament.		If you play with this filament long enough you can probably get it to work, but not sure it was worth the hassle. I will probably stick with the Inland at my local store. It prints better and costs less (Although colors are not that vibrant). I still have a "translucent" red to try of the WYZworks. Lets hope it does a little better.
1,This is bad in every way.		1. It LEANS.  It doesn't even stand flat	2. It LEAKS.  A lot.  It doesn't matter how tight you screw the base on, it will leak.	3. It's Plastic.  Because of problem #2, I have already damaged the bottom from attempting to screw it even tighter, and it's cracking.		Buy a glass graduated cylinder instead.  Wish I had done it right the first time.
1,I got a bad batch. The ABS was mixed with some other thermoplastic, possibly PLA but it could be anything. I only found out when I tried to dissolve some in acetone. ABS plastic dissolves completely in acetone leaving you with a mixture that you can use as glue on your heatbed, or to glue two pieces of ABS together. You can also use acetone vapor to chemically polish the surface of an ABS printed part, it's one of the great reasons for using ABS to print. This filament did not dissolve completely, there were strands of another plastic left behind that acetone does not dissolve. No matter how long I left it to dissolve, this other plastic remained, contaminating the whole bottle and making a mess. So the filament is defective and I'm returning two rolls of it. Hopefully this is just a single bad batch and not representative of the product as a whole. I tried to attach a picture of the strands left behind next to another brands ABS but anytime I attach it my review is not accepted..
1,bubbles...bubbles everywhere...		this is a hit and miss manufacturer.  some rolls are good...while others seem to have been stored at the bottom of a dirty lake.		i feel bad about dumping a bad review, but after the third roll of of this stuff that was freshly opened and within minutes was being used left tiny bubbles of water vapor in my print and in the nozzle.  i hope thing can be improved on your end.
1,I have a number of these with the trash cans, in different colors. The lids do not securely attach to the trash cans and the raccoons bite through these very easily.
1,I like cobalt glass, and my wife likes it even more. So, I purchased this to please her. It is really a beautiful piece of glass, and seems substantial. The dispenser on top looks real nice--however. When we first got it, every time after we used it, it would have lost the vacuum in the straw inside, and we'd have to pump it several times to get soap back up to come out.		So, I noticed that the straw was bent quite a bit, maybe a a half inch longer than the inside dimensions, so I snipped about a quarter inch off the bottom. It held its vacuum right away, and worked quite well for about a couple weeks. Then we noticed that after using it, it would slowly ooze soap out of the tip of the dispenser, and drip, drip, drip slowly on the counter, without seeming to reach the end of dripping. What a mess.		Sad to say, despite the really nice look of this product, it has been a GREAT disappointment, especially for the price.
1,Had me believing my brew was not ready. Hydrometer said differently. Not-trustworthy. Sent it back after 1 month. Back to hydrometer only
1,so thin, so hard to get a clean piece off the roll, get a run it it, prepare to lose and throw away a lot of it. First time and last time buying it.
1,Although labeled Antique White, it appeared like plain white to me.
1,I bought this brand of toothpaste in the Fennel flavor because I do not like to use mint, which counteracts the effects of homeopathic remedies. I had assumed, based on past reputation, that Tom's toothpaste contained only safe, healthy ingredients. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I am very sorry I did not look up the current ingredients before purchasing this product, because there are some questionable ingredients, in particular, carrageenan and sodium lauryl sulfate. I have listed all the ingredients below, and included descriptions of the objectionable ones.		I will not be purchasing this brand again.		Calcium carbonate, water, glycerin, sodium bicarbonate, xylitol, carrageenan, natural flavors, sodium lauryl sulfate, stevia rebaudiana extract (stevia), commiphora myrrha resin extract (myrrh) and propolis cera (from bees).		Carrageenan: This is a common food additive which is extracted from a seaweed commonly known as Irish moss. Carrageenan is used as a thickener and emulsifier to improve the texture of processed foods. For some time now, research has indicated it produces&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/inflammation/dp/B000P0JGLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">inflammation</a>&nbsp;in the body, which is considered to cause or contribute to every known disease.		Natural Flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: "The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.		Sodium Lauryl Sulfate: Thousands of studies have indicated the toxicity of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). It is a detergent, surfactant, and emulsifier found in cosmetics, toiletries and household and industrial cleansers. This chemical is linked to nitrosamines, which are dangerous carcinogens that increase the body's tendency to absorb nitrates, which are also known carcinogens.
1,Better description would have avoided the purchase from the start. I really wanted the other 9 sensors to work
1,This is the worst filament I have ever used and I have tried a couple. Parts printed are very weak and de-laminate with any force at all. Stay away. If this wasn't a consumable I would be looking to return this ASAP.
1,These are not real good for use on a 3d printer nozzle since they break easy and they are not near long enough to use on a Diamond hotend. I would not recommend these.
1,Listed as 4 ft by 6 ft, which in my book is 48 x 72 inches. Mat measures 45x69. Needed it for a specific space where it matters. Put an accurate measurement on your products for crying out loud. It ain't brain surgery.
1,Purchased with MP's Ultimate printer (Wanhao D6). This and the tiny rolls of filament packaged with machine are worst I've ever used.
1,You will save money in the long run with more a expensive printer!  With that said, let me also state that the the printer itself is not bad.  It was easy to install the software and print.  It was cheap.  But for the money you save on the printer, you will easily pay more than a far more expensive printer in the long run on proprietary PLA spools.  Yes -- I bought this printer because of the price.	The disappointment that I have is that I have a lot of PLA that I cannot use in the printer because of the NFC chip in the spools.  I have also found that the NFC chip disables the printer before the proprietary spools run out of PLA (10-30 meters per roll).  So now I am ending up with even more left over PLA.  Just a few weeks of use and I am already looking for a different printer.	My recommendation is do NOT buy this printer if you think it is a good price.  It is not.  Look for something that will let you use non proprietary PLA.		UPDATE: I went to print today and the printer and software told me that the spool was empty and refused to print (what a joke!!!).  There is more than half of the PLA remaining on the spool.  This was so infuriating that I unplugged the printer, walked it out, and threw it in the recycle bin.  I then gathered up all remaining XYZ spools that I had and tossed it as well.  The printer worked OK, but their proprietary spools will eventually be the downfall of this company.  I will never buy another product from XYZ.  I just finished ordering a new printer from a different manufacturer.
1,You have to install a non-certified app to use this at all. There doesn't seem to be anything malicious, but it's not certain. Any time you have to disable a security feature to use a product, it's not great.
1,Never really got to use this. It would jam consistently after a few seconds of use.	It was cool for a few minutes.
1,Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.
1,I use a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush on a daily basis, but wanted something more portable for travel.  I had hoped this battery-powered toothbrush would be a good stand-in, but it is no better than manual brushing.		What a disappointment.  I wish I could have read the Panasonic operating instructions before actually getting it.  Step five says it all, "Brush by moving the toothbrush in the same way as when you brush by hand."  The real test is putting a dab of toothpaste on the brush and turning it on...outside your mouth.  Users will not see any toothpaste or toothbrush motion--just a buzzy sound.  Now try that with any Philips electric toothbrush--active bristle motion and toothpaste flying in all directions.		I'm confident Philips electric toothbrushes help with good oral hygiene.  My mouth feels clean after each use and dental check-ups have never been better.  You can get that same clean feeling with this Panasonic electric toothbrush too, but only if you brush well by hand.  Save yourself some money, and instead buy a dollar store toothbrush and travel cap.  It will do just as good a job.
1,I'd be very careful with wiring this thing up for anything with significant load.  I've just had 2 ordered for a project involving commercial motorized door locks running off 24VDC.  I got them in my hands today.  First, the wire that comes off of it was missing some set screws from the factory, so I could not use the terminal.  OK, no biggie, I can use crimp connectors or whatnot.  But then I got looking at the wire lead itself.  It is no bigger than 22AWG.  So I got out my screwdriver and pulled up the terminal strip itself to see what was connecting everything.  The wire connecting each terminal is no bigger than 24AWG.  I based this off of solid core network cable.  Since I was going to use this in a commercial environment, I soldered in a reinforcing backbone of 18AWG wire which I know will beef it up a bit.  If I had known I would need to do this, I would have looked elsewhere for something properly build and rated for more draw.  The product is a bit misleading in that the terminals themselves are of a type designed for much more load, but the actual construction limits its usability.
1,screen went blank after 3 prints an quit working
1,did not hold firmly in my breadboard
1,None of these worked as near as I can tell. Don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but I've tried every possible wiring option and a variety of libraries for the Arduino that support the DS18b and have pretty much given up.
1,So 1 of mine arrived with the broken inlets and outlets just like several other people here in the reviews. They seem to run ok, not super powerful, but probably enough for my use case. I'm giving them 2 stars because it is obvious that the broken inlets and outlets are an ongoing issue that is not being addressed. I don't have time to go out of my way to send it back, wait, then order another one.
1,What a piece of junk. And what an incompetently designed item. For shame. Especially hilarious is the way  the additional battery cell was crammed in, probably after the whole design was tooled up and the pilot run found to be unsaleable with its anemic suction.
1,In spite of a review from Nov. 2012, the size has not been corrected. Mine measured 86mm x 11mm. I think we should be able to expect a truthful description from a seller, especially since it has been pointed out before. My uses were non-scientific so the size difference didn't make much difference for my uses, but if they are said to be 100 x 15mm, then that is what I expect.
1,They work, but there's no/little solder on the connection so you need to rip it apart and resolder it. Only three out of five worked at all, even after resoldering. Would not reccoemend. Also, the ones that did work did not last long.
1,I order apple juice in one gallon jugs.  I wanted to utilize these after opening the twist off tops.  They do not fit.
1,cheap junk.  do not bother to buy this item.  spend a little more and get a quality one. will return this item.
1,Dont waste your money. these are crap period! comes with no batteries slide off your face. and you have to hold what ever you are working on right up to the lens. Very hard to work on anything by that.
1,Would not calabrate, made many attempts before giving up and buying a real one for $35. Don't be cheap like me it had a swing of 2 not .2 but 2 I put in buffer it shows right turn off back on showing 9 and still climbing
1,When mixed, this stuff has the thickness of peanut butter.  It won't brush on at all.  The only way to spread it was with a spatula.  As a result, wetting out cloth was difficult.  Wetting out mat was near on impossible.  When it cured it was tough stuff, but IMHO it wasn't worth the effort.
1,Does not include grub screws for flat shafts, in case you need to follow an existing alignment. Description says it does.
1,Dimensions are off. Makes a very expensive unusable piece of plastic.
1,Worked until I cleaned it per the manual instructions. Very disappointed. Took the wheel assembly out per the manual instructions and removed the wheels exactly as described in the manual to get to the wound up hair. Reassembled and wheels will not turn. I bought another as a gift and was about to buy a third as a gift but this has changed those plans, Needs a better design to prevent hair from getting trapped in the  wheel assembly so it doesn't have to be taken apart to be cleaned. Not worth my twentyfive bucks. Sad. I had even named it Rosie O'Grady..
1,This epoxy leaked out of the bottom after first opening, ran out over the top of a cabinet and ruined it. Needs to be stored with the tip down, but you will only learn that the hard way. Lousy packaging of OK glue.
1,smaller in dia, won't pull through without adjusting drive..
1,Extremely low melting point, clogs up print head immediately. No good for 3d printers. There's no way this is actual PTFE
1,The sticker on the top that says "peel here" doesn't come off.  When peeling I had to scratch it off and now the lid looks like hell.  Thanks a lot!
1,I've ordered these twice. The first time was great, I received full stainless steel VXB branded bearings that spin for 45 seconds + in fidget spinners. The 2nd time I ordered these the bearing cages were plastic and the bearings were branded "Warp Speed" and they sucked! They can barely spin for 15 seconds, completely different product than the legit VXB bearings I originally received.
1,Compared to Black PETG from PRUSA this filamnet is a nightmare. I have better results with hatchbox PETG or ABS.	My first black eSUN PETG printed great, the following ones not so much.
1,Tried 2 differant ones thought the first was broke... but nope I wasn't very impressed returned!!!
1,Although the plastic prints good, I was half through an 8 hour print and the extruder chewed through the filament because the winding on the spool was looped under other filament causing feeding to stop. When I unwound  some of it to clear the issue, it was looped on three rotations of the spool out of six. Maybe there's even more, not sure.		I'm new to 3D printing and I've used other brands sold on Amazon that  print just as good, much cheaper, Made in USA and don't have entangled winding. But, I was caught up in the hype.
1,11 7/8 x 11 7/8... if you are advertising it's 12" then make it 12"
1,Inaccurate, battery drains quickly, movement not smooth.
1,They look good. But you can't insert small parts (resistors, diodes, led's, capacitors etc.) without bending the leads. The holes are to tight. I've had to force a jumper wire into each hole before inserting a smaller part. i can get them to work but it's a lot of trouble. I wouldn't recommend these.
1,Not cost effective. recommend buying swordfish 30090 kit..
1,I found that the product reads temperatures 4F off againist 3 other independent thermometers...If 4degree F does not make any differance for you buy one otherwise I suggest more accurate device (which ever that may be)
1,I regret buying this! The only thing it's good for is a mean practical joke. I got this to extend the life of my TENS unit pads. I grudgingly give the product one star because it did stick to my skin and it did conduct the current. But......I am heartily sorry I used it. It ruined a large pad I use on my lower back. I just wanted to increase the adhesion. This stuff stays permanently gummy and the patch slides on the skin, leaving goo behind. When you touch it, strings pull up and spread the mess. It cannot simply be wiped off with a dry paper towel. When you wet it, it takes on the consistency of slug slime. It must be scrubbed with hot soapy water over and over. Then, you get white, water-logged boogers. Plus, you still have a sticky residue left behind. I gave up because my skin was sore. It also seemed to conduct the current irregularly. In some parts of the pad, the current felt like a sharp pinprick!
1,Nice S hook and the twist tie is a good idea. I used it to tie my coat or my neck pillow while travel. So constnatly switching between the two. At some point (don't know where), I lost the twist tie, so I am only left with he S-hook. Use it carefully.
1,they call them keepers but oh hell no i will not use these slings
1,The parts I received do not match the videos you follow to build the kit.  For example, the H-plate that slides along the Y axis is acrylic in the video.  I received 3 metal plates screwed together with screws, some of which were stripped when I received the kit.  The metal isn't nearly as thick as the acrylic, so I'm having to guess which screws to use to attach it.		Some of the longitudinal bearings that slide along the various shafts were loose and/or the tiny bearings would fall out as you insert the ends of the shaft.  I'm not even half way done building the kit, and already 6 of the small acrylic pieces have cracked just from moving the printer around.  I've made replacements from wood, and hopefully I will be able to print real replacement parts once the kits it assembled.		The front and back acrylic plates of the printer are bowing just from the little tension of the y-axis belt.  I would recommend getting some other version of this kit with more metal and less brittle acrylic pieces.
1,Not a fan of these, the plastic is very thin and not of good quality and can break easily when you're trying to close the connector and get a good seal	Overprices ones from RadioShack are of much higher quality, and those have two metal pieces to make contact with the wire you're tapping, this product only has one such metal piece		don't get me wrong, they do work, but there's better stuff out there, I wouldn't trust something like this in my car, broke a couple when installing, will look for another brand next time and avoid these 100pack cheapies
1,Wobbly and took forever to arrive.
1,to complicated .... I lost my money
1,I purchased a sheet 1/8" thick and 12" x 24" long. This was to be cut for a bed for a 3D printer.	I was very disappointed that the sheet was very warped, does not lie flat at all and impossible to correct the bowing in this.	At the price I paid, which was over $100, I cannot recommend this material, if they are all warped like this.
1,This product was just okay. I only used ita. Short time. It didn't stand up easily in the charger and wasn't convenient  to keep on sink. Oh we'll.
1,I have purchased four or five of these containers. EVERY one of them has gone hard and dry in spite of properly sealing the container after use. I contacted the manufacturer to complain about the early and quick demise of their product and request a replacement. They refused. They told me to contact the selling store for a free replacement and that the mfg has a replacement agreement in place with retailers. The manager of Ace Hardware innitially told me he has never heard of such agreement. Ace however DID exchange the can for me at no charge. The manufacturer also told me that the container is a "TEMPORARY CONTAINER" !!! They advised me to transfer remaining product into an air tight container! It is a little too late for that now it appears. I'd ONLY buy this product if I intended to use it ALL in one day. It works fine when the can is first opened.
1,This is a repurchase and they must have changed the formula because the color is different. It's more of a dull brown/green than bronze, and does NOT have a  look metallic at all. Also, unlike Colorfabb and eSun bronze filaments, this brand has no actual metal content.		The last time I purchased this, it had a very accurate bronze color. Not this time. The photo still shows how it looked as the bronze metallic material. This is a bait and switch! I won't be purchasing it again after this experience.		I can recommend their metallic silver however.
1,Did not work for me.  It was a waste of money.  I ended up purchasing GORILLA glue to finish the job.  Don't know what type of glue this is, it did not deliver what it stays, and would NEVER buy it again.
1,Small basket
1,This kit is OK, but each part comes in the same quantity, so you're going to run out of the parts that you'll be using the most often (e.g. the nuts... you only get 12 of them, so really you can only mount three standalone boards before running out of nuts.) You're better off just buying the exact parts you need and paying a little extra per part, rather than also getting a bunch of 20mm spacers you'll never use.
1,Dumb of me to order plastic.....
1,This is not worth the money. I was only able to use it 3'xs before it smelled up my house horribly!  Even changing the bag each time I vacuumed and adding the fresheners. I wish I had never purchased it!
1,The holes are NOT a 1/4" they are about a 64th smaller which means a 1/4" bolt will NOT fit. I drilled all 96 holes with a 1/4" bit. The wheel isn't 2". The holes aren't even remotely equally spaced or spaced the same between each wheel. There isn't enough space between the hole and the raised rim for the bearings to fit the head of any attaching hardware. Once weight is apply the casters drag on the hardware. I installed 12 then bought a different type and will be installing 24 different casters.
1,Both ends are 5mm not 1x5, 1x8 as the description says.
1,Crap super thin and bar code WILL NOT come off!!! Pisses me off and on top of it "NO RETURNS ON THIS ITEM"!!!
1,This printer works ok for smaller objects, but the moment you try to print anything bigger than 20x20mm, it will have problems.  Leveling the bed is a giant pain in the butt because of the wing nuts. I spent more time trying to get this to print than actually printing. Save yourself a headache and go with something a little more pricer. I ended up buying an Ultimaker 2+ and, although more than 6 times the cost, is 600x the quality. Prints that were actually successful at a certain resolution compared to prints on my Ultimaker at the same resolution were of no comparison.
1,This thing is a mess.  See attached picture.  I have had it for 6 months now and I have tried to get it to work properly.  I have spent hundreds of hours attempting to get it to work reliably. It doesn't.  Both the X and Y axes skip.  See the attached picture.  To fix this I: 1) lubricated the shafts, 2) lubricated the bearings, 3) replaced the bearings, 4) replaced the bearings again, 5) realigned the Y axis shafts to achieve a very smooth operation, 6) tried multiple materials on the bed to get items to stick, and finally found BuildTak that works.  To no avail.  The print in the picture is my latest attempt.  My final solution to this problem is to buy a different printer from Amazon.  Hopefully, this next one will be higher quality.
1,This reads a different temperature and humidity than my thermostat when sitting right below it.
1,I really wanted to like this brand.	Bought one after one of my indicators failed from old age. The first one I bought I was fairly impressed to say the least. As time progressed I was liking it more and more. It steadily has become my favorite 0-1 indicator and still is. So I decided to purchase 2 more at once. This was going to be my standard. Going to purchase a FEW MORE after that too. "No more bland, white-faced, noisy, chinese mass produced indicators for me" says I.	I was wrong.	Upon receiving the 2 (almost giddy like a little school girl) I opened up the nice plastic cases they come with, picked them up and tested the "super smooth action". These indicators went from Hero-to-Zero. The springs were SUPER WEAK on BOTH OF THEM. They wouldn't even return to zero. WHAT THE- gotta return these.	Shameful. Pitiful. Why?! sorry Anytime Tools, they make good 1-2-3 blocks though. Looks like i'll be going back to buying bland,noisy ubiquitous indicators and save up for the real deal. Mit's.
1,This is a Small tool. Not in the same league with Sterrett. I should just have bought a premium product to begin with. This will do the job, but at my age, it is toooooo small to read.
1,They're a nice value as far as replacement electrodes go, however, I am having an allergic reaction to the gel/adhesive they have on these. They are latex free, which I'm not allergic to latex...in fact I'm not allergic to anything that I know of, but after wearing these my skin breaks out into an itchy red area starting directly where the electrode was applied and spreading.  I tried being sure to thoroughly wash/soap/rinse the areas where the electrodes were, but it's still extremely uncomfortable.  After using them one time and removing them, I then have a good 3 day span of itching so badly that it wakes me up in the middle of the night. I wish that wasn't the case since I thought the price was excellent, but I won't be ordering these again.
1,poor quality and hard to use
1,This is a great product but the exact same thing is about a buck less at most local stores. To make my shopping experience worse there was an issue with delivery too. I usually love my prime account but there must have been some sort of mix up in shipping. For some reason my prime order didn't even ship for over a week after I placed my order. I ordered thinking I'd be saving myself a trip to the store, instead, I went to the store twice for other products and saw this sitting on the shelf mocking me about my project that I couldn't start as I waited for amazon's shipping. Oh well, when it finally arrived the JB weld did the job. This stuff will stick just about anything to just about anything else permanently.
1,<div id="video-block-R2YYC66RMRP2S" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B19Qj6qHrpS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1rpHyacVGS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;I decided to give this color a try as my experience with Green, White, Black has been great, only to meet results of similar issues others experienced. I got the filament on June9/10 and opened the vacuum sealed packaging and checked the O.D. and hooked it up to my printer. I've had other filaments with moisture issues and those could be dried but this is the worst moisture I've even seen in a filament, so bad I thought there was an issue with the nozzle but after changing setups the results remained the same.		I plan to try again with this filament but will wait for Amazon to restock again.
1,a nice toy.
1,This board is fine and a good value with the following important caveats:		1. If you use with a 24VDC power supply and 24VDC heated bed you are probably OK because the current draw will be reasonable.		2. If you have a 12VDC power supply and 12VDC heated bed you will eventually burn-out or melt the DC input terminal on the control board because it is not robust enough and won't accept wire with sufficient gauge for the current draw.  You can fix this by adding an external MOSFET controller .  I bought this one on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ARQQ-Heat-Bed-Mosfet-Tube-Hot-Bed-Power-Module-Expansion-for-3D-Printer-Heating-Bed-Accessories/dp/B01MSH8Z08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ARQQ Heat Bed Mosfet Tube Hot Bed Power Module Expansion for 3D Printer Heating Bed Accessories</a>.  It offloads the heated bed power and accommodates proper 12AWG wire that won't overheat at 12VDC.
1,I don't know why it would say 45% humidity is low and 29% humidity is ok this don't seem very accurate to me.
1,First impressions/experience:	Awaiting an affordable 3D printer, the DaVinci 1.0 seemed like a dream come true. I just so happened to run across this product the day before retail sale in the U.S. I recieved it 3 days later, had a great conversation with the delivery man about 3D printing and how it is now a real attainable thing. I carefully unpackaged the device and got it all set up. Plugged it into my PC and booted the machine. Expecting to see some sort of boot sequence in the display, it was disappointingly dark. Being optimistic, i assumed it was a firmware installation issue. After updating to the most current firmware, still just a dark display. The buttons will result in a beep, the machine goes through a physical boot sequence when turned on, the PC software recognizes that a filament cartridge has not been loaded properly. You must use the physical buttons on the device to navigate the display on the device to load cartridges, configure etc. I certainly hope that XYZprinting will send me a new product paying shipping both ways to remedy this situation. Point being, buyers be wary of buying new products. I will say in the defense of XYZ the packaging and layout of its product is quite nice. I immediately contacted customer service and Amazon in order to remedy the situation. New printer is on the way and review will be updated as seen fit.		Update: I have been working with the da Vinci for a week now and I'm pretty impressed. Keeping my expectations in the 500 dollar 3D printer range, this device is quite exceptional. Sure there are a few layering errors or filament feed problems along the way. However, the resolution of print and overall finished products are not too bad. Only a few minor issues such as a squealy X axis and a heated bed error. The heated bed error is typically after you've printed an object and the machine has gone into stand by mode. When waking the printer from stand by, the machine will load the .3w file and raise the bed in preparation to print. Once the bed is near temp, the machine flashes the 0010 heated bed incorrect temp error. Simply resetting the machine resolves this issue, but you just wasted 20 minutes getting things ready. Since I have shut the machine down between prints the only problem has been that amazon doesn't have any filament! Someone on MAKE has made a reset for the cartridge chip if you'd like to rewind your own cartridges and are tech savvy. Thanks for reading, the da Vinci will be a great starter 3D printer for someone who has no problems with troubleshooting. Hope this info helps, have a good day.		Update 2: Printer has failed once again. This time all is after the warranty on parts has run out. The communication with XYZPrinting's customer service is as flaky as a teenager. Haven't received any help from them at all. Calibrate the heat bed, install new firmware, update the software... Yeah the first 15 emails telling me to do this was quite fruitless. I found out more information on the forums than anything they ever did. So i did some work myself, after extensive testing the stepper motor on the hot end is overheating about 25 minutes into the print. I have now fully voided the warranty splicing the leads for the hot end and removed and tested stepper motor. After contacting customer support a week ago, they told me they would forward my request to purchase a new stepper with drive gear. Still haven't heard back. Nice, build a proprietary machine and not support it. I have since purchased and built a rostock max kit, and will never look back. Looking into using a bearing puller to remove gear and buy a cheapo stepper to work for now. Thanks for taking my $500 and running with it!
1,I bought this and I never use it because it doesn't have an edge to it.  I could put an edge on it if I had the proper tools but it just sits next to my 3d printer as I use a paint spatula + a razor blade knife instead.
1,The calipers worked at first but now they keep adding or subtracting .2 inches to some measurements
1,Having purchased an already expensive shop-vac that came with a tiny 1/2" or 1" hose I was already disgruntled about buying this. It works the way it should but my shop-vac has lost suction due to the increase in hose diameter and it doesn't work as great as it should. Needless to say I will be purchasing a Craftsman shop-vac down the road.
1,This unit is over rated. The Klein Tools NCVT-2 is way better. For starters, the plastic tip is too large and you either have to file it down or accept that it will wear down your outlets prematurely. Secondly, you can't hold it up to a light switch to test for voltage, so it is not that sensitive. Lastly, there's about a 250 ms delay before it detects voltage. I find this annoying. The Klein NCVT-2 has none of these issues and you can set it to a low-voltage mode to detect live switches. The 1AC-A1-II will serve as a door stop.
1,the Rubbermaid trash can is great and a rubber type of material with a dull red finish this lid however is a shiny plastic so i really don't think it will last as long as the can will.
1,Actually I don't know how good or bad the tape itself is as I have not been able to get the plastic wrap off the individual rolls.
1,iVE HAD SERIOUS ISSUES WITH THIS RED AND THE SOLID BLUE.  bOTH OF THEM ARE NOTHING LIKE THE OTHER PETG PRODUCTS IVE TRIED FROM ESUN... vERY WEAK AND BRITTLE ,AND ATTEMPTS TO GET A STABLE BUILD OUT OF THIS FILAMENT IS A WASTE OF MY LIFE.. iVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A GOOD PRINT OUT OF THESE 2 KGS FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND HAVE YET TO GET ONE GOOD PRINT OUT OF I IT AND HAVE ALMOST RUN THROUGH BOTH KGS.	iVE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH TROUBLE WITH A FILAMENT AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS MUCH FRUSTRATION TRYING TO COMPLETE A SIMPLE PRINT... nOT EVEN WHEN I HAD NO IDEA WTF I WAS DOING DID I WANT TO BLOW UP MY PRINTER LIKE I DO WHEN THIS FILAMENT IS IN MY FILAMENT RACK, BUT I PAID MY HARD EARNED MONEY FOR IT SO I WILL KEEP TRYING TIL ITS GONE.	 I DEFINATELY WILL NOT BE BUYING THE OPAQUE RED AND BLUE PETG ANYMORE...IT SUCKS SOMETHING FIERCE.  NOT TOO SURE I WILL TRY ANY OTHER OPAQUE CRAP AS THE TRANSPARENT ONES ARE THE STRONGER OUT OF THE COLORS ANYWAY AND I NEVER HAD MORE THAN A FEW BAD PRINTS WITH A TRANSPARENT PETG FILAMENT, AND THATS OUT OF A CLOSE TO A COUPLE HUNDRED OR SO COMPLETED PRINTS.	  i CANT THINK OF ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE RED AND BLUE. THE COLORS ARE WAY OFF FROM THE DESCRIPTION PICS AS WELL... RED IS MORE OF A DARK PINK OR LIGHT ORANGE THAN SOLID RED AND THE BLUE IS VERY DARK ALMOST NAVY IN COLOR...SOLID IN COLOR THOUGH.		WITH THIS FAILED PURCHASE AND ALL OF THE HEADACHES AND TROUBLES IVE HAD WITH THESE LAST 2 KGs OF "FILAMENT"...i AM SERIOUSLY CONCIDERING LOOKING FOR ANOTHER GO-TO BRAND OF FILAMENT. THIS MUCH HASSLE IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE
1,So far out of spec. that it is useless. The ends are flared. Doesn't even hold bad spec for more than an inch or 2. Good for poking someone, but that is about it. Looks like it is rolled. It is bar stock.
1,I was specifically looking for something to help secure nails and screws when they're put into place.  This came up as a suggestion, and it didn't say that it needed a caulking gun.  On the package, it says NOTHING about using it for nails, screws, or other fasteners.  I'm quite disappointed.  I'm vacillating between returning it or getting a caulking gun and using it when the need comes up, but it's not what it was suggested for, and that disappoints me.  I'm sure, knowing that it's a Loctite product, that it will adhere very well on the kinds of jobs for which it was designed, but I'm annoyed that it came up as a product to use to help anchor nails and screws (yes, I know what a screw anchor is, and this job does not call for it).
1,Just arrived today. Put 2 different batteries in it and didn't work. Great that Amazon was able to refund me but I wanted a working item. Poor quality control on manufacturer.
1,Unlike others I received the correct 3/8 hose BUT this stuff is GARBAGE.  I flushed my lines before hooking up my new carb and even with gas just flowing through this line ( NO pressure or sitting in line at all ) this line turned the gas BROWN.. there is no way anyone can tell me that poluting gas with whatever is turning it brown in the line is good for jets or injectors SEE PICTURE.  I sent this back , got line from the local parts store and my gas is now crystal clear.		I am so glad I thought to flush the line AND use a glass filter to catch anything in there and actually see what was flowing through. I will NEVER use a Thermoid product again
1,I was taken in by all the marketing hype on this crappy sensor.  I have been trying to use two of them on two different printers and have been having nothing but trouble.  The are not consistent between probes and one I have jams and misreads if there is even a hint of dust on it.  I would return the ones I have if I could, but they are going into the trash and I'm going back to inductive sensors.
1,These things are straight junk...  Bought 6 of them and almost  all broke within 2 months of buying them...		2 came with broken clips, I really don't care about that...		5 of the 6, the magnets' glue came off so the magnets won't stick to the device...		3 so far are showing partial numbers for the temp and humidity, making them unreadable and useless....
1,way too dry to use, won't stick to wall just balls up, may be a bad batch I got because I believe I've used this brand before and it was good, but this one is far too dry to work with at all, it's similar to play doh.
1,Decent CPR mask. ? counterfeits.		Case is EXTREMELY large. be aware!  For the price, it was worth to have just in case!
1,I can barely see anything through the small viewing window.  I didn't realize it was going to be such a small window to view through.  If I had to do over again, I would order the larger viewing window and skip the curettes, never ended up using those at all.  I bought to use for our newborn to check her ears.  It was so hard to tell what I was looking at through the small window I didn't know how far I was in and may have accidentally hit the babies eardrum because she started screaming pretty loud.  I'm a technician and work with tools for a living including boroscopes so I thought it would be a cinch to look in the babies ear, it definitely was not using this tool. It may work for an adult in a pinch as the ear canal is bigger and easier to see but not for a baby or small child.  I don't use it anymore out of fear of sticking it in too far on accident because I can't see very well through the tiny window.  Also, it gets dark the further you go in the ear the light isn't bright enough to see the ear drum well.  Looks cheaply made maybe $1 to manufacture.
1,Video quality is very very low res, looks like an old vhs...probably not even that good. I have ear tubes...I had one blow out. While I don't expect to self diagnose myself, I just wanted to be able to see if they are in place ...the last time I went in to the doc, he showed me my eardrum and it was plain to see there was a big prob so I got this camera. With this camera, you just cant see much detail  when looking inside something. It's just very low quality video in general.	At the same time, what can you expect for a $20 endoscope . I rolled the dice and it's not so hot. My bad...I won't return it, it's $20 worth of endoscope. I'd suggest probably look at ones that cost a bit more and maybe have some youtube video's showing the video quality.	This one is just not worth even the $20 , because you just cant see anything clearly so it's kind of useless. Yes, I cleaned the lens. I have many camera's, GoPro's and many other electronics all my life ...i'm the guy everyone calls to help or fix their stuff. Trust me, save your money.
1,These do not help. Easily shatterable too, so watch out for getting cut on those glass fragments.
1,I have gone through 2 of these boards. First one caught fire when a transistor shorted out because a switch (filament monitor) was the wrong way around, the instructions are such bad translations of Chinese to English that it was shockingly easy to get wrong. The board NEEDS some circuit protection. Second board died for seemingly no reason at all... Stopped reading more than one temp sensor at once, can't seem to work out why but I don't even want a new one. I replaced it with another board from OSOYOO. Do not buy this board if you can find anything else.
1,Dimensions are off. Makes a very expensive unusable piece of plastic.
1,These are crap. After waiting over tree weeks to get them, they finally arrived. The first noticeable problem is that they're flimsy - vert thin plastic. I could live with that, but most importantly, the caps won't screw on tightly. You'll tear up your fingers trying, but even with pliers they won't screw on sufficiently to keep from leaking. Finally, the whole mess reeks of gasoline - after trying to screw on a few caps I threw the whole bag into recycling and washed my hands. A complete waste of money and time.
1,The product works well. However, 1 star for providing no instructions and making me waste 15 minutes trying to figure out what all the different modes are.		Include instructions with your products, especially when they have ridiculous custom designations that are specific to your product.
1,Nice bottle but the nozzle neck cracks and breaks.  I purchased six and three of them have broken in the same place.  Appears the machining of the threaded part needs to be reengineered.  Would NOT recommend until then.
1,the stuff stuck together every where it was bent I guess from the high temp needs to be powder coated to prevent this. I needed pieces 11 3/4 long so this did not work mine were only around 6 inches
1,Like ink cartridges, they have us over a barrel. Without the replacement heads, one's Sonicare is useless; the price has gone up over $5 for the compact 3-pack. Anyhow, the compact bristles are about 5/8", compact for those of us with smallish mouths, and easier around the back of the molars. I'd always bang around with the standard-size brushes, giving myself a jolt and a shock. However, the standard 3-pack size is less expensive and covers more surface, I'll go back to the other size.		Update: while removing the compact brush head, it came off in two parts... just swell. Still works, but I will use a screw driver to pry off the brush head next time. Not what I expected for anything this expensive.
1,these things are junk; they can't withstand solder heat for very long.
1,This photo-sensor worked fantastic... but only for three months.		The internal relay is now sticking in the off position, and will no longer turn on at night unless I reach up and thwack it with a broom handle.		Ordered the Tork 2001 today instead, let's hope it lasts longer.		:(
1,When I received the product and read the directions, I was impressed. The mixing bottle that's included is cool. Marked clearly, seems impossible to mix incorrectly. I poured the harder to the first line, then the resin up to the second line, screwed the cap on to the mixing bottle and shook for over a minute. The product looked totally mixed. Then the problem..... application. This stuff is like water. I am in Tucson, temp was 84 degrees. The directions say one hour set up time...Ha! If your application includes any vertical needs, forget it. This stuff ran everywhere and made a huge mess. It sat 12 hours in Tucson Arizona and never set completely. Trust me, you can't make a mistake mixing it using the mixing/squeeze application bottle. This was a huge waste of my time and money. All I have now is a big mess to clean up. Worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon.
1,A week after I bought this tank, the Hoover quit working. Threw it all in the garbage.
1,didnt last too long
1,I'm disappointed in this filament.  Its properties aren't too bad, it melts at the expected temperature. and adheres to blue painters tape and a previous PLA layer reasonably well.  The color is slightly more transparent than natural PLA but not enough to justify the extra cost.  Where this filament disappoints is in the manufacture.  The thickness is remarkably inconsistent, it's very wavy instead of smooth, and it isn't wound on the spool very well.  As with most transparent PLA, it is very sensitive to moisture and needs to be sealed in a bag with desiccant when not in use.  Where the end has been scored by the extruder gear, it will always break the next day.  And the extruder gear seems to have a surprising amount of trouble holding on to the filament.  I can't use this filament in an unattended printer and I frequently need to restart prints because of this.  I won't buy this again.
1,This did not fit the poly pipe I have.  It is undersized and required 2 hose clamps to get it even close.  If I'd found a replacement I'd have returned these...as it is they do work but you'll need extra strong hose clamps and heat for the pipe...not acceptable!
1,Dreadful experience. How could they manufacture these that can't fit regular 1/4-20 bolts of other makes. Tried several other T-bolts that were meant to fit with these knobs but none could. Not of any use if they won't fit. Had a refund from Amazon.
1,Got almond, but not realy almond.  More like a light cream color.
1,Pro's:	*  Only takes 1 AA battery (not included).	*  Min/max readings on the display, for both temp & humidity.	*  Refrigerator magnet on the back.		Con's:	*  Temp display could only display ODD temperature values (75F, 77C, 79C) maybe due to internal C to F conversion using integer math.  Funny it could not display 78F as in the Amazon product photo.	*  Spec'd temp range is a pitiful +/-4F (an 8 degree inaccuracy range).  In my case, the temp display was usually 2F off (your results may vary).	*  Humidity reading was also out of spec (7% too high, versus a spec'd +/-5%).	*  Display was slightly harder to read in a dark room than other LCD thermometers I have tried, and is not back-lit.
1,Cheaper at sears!!!! And all craftsman tools are are made in china now.	I took a old ratchet that has made in usa stamped on the handle back to be fixed and the girl at the counter didn't know how to change the gear out so she walked over and pulled a new ratchet off the shelf and said here you go. The new craftsman ratchet says made in china. I told her to find someone else that can fix my old ratchet as I didn't want made in china tools. She told me that all craftsman tools are being made in china, said they still have some old stock of USA tools but you have to search the shelves for them. Also showed me that the box of gears to fix the ratchets is made in china.	So craftsman is no longer a USA brand!!!!
1,The rope is nothing special. It'll do the job I need it to do. However, what really ticked me off is that the manufacturer makes a point of emphasizing "USA" in the product description ("Rope King USA"), which might suggest to some that its manufactured in the USA. I'm the fool who failed to spend the extra time necessary to learn that it's not made in the USA. It wasn't until I received the item that I figured out the answer to that question. Says it on the part of the label not pictured in the product description  Made in China.		I've run in to the problem before. Although this particular purchase was intended for hardware use, this is the same type of rope my dog loves to play tug with. Just the sight of this got his tail wagging, but I had to say no. I won't give him rope from China. In the past, I've spent an untold number of hours searching pet websites for rope tug toys made in the USA, but no luck. I just don't get it.		I don't understand why it's so difficult to find rope made in the USA		My preference for rope made in the USA isn't political, rather it's a health concern. Manufacturers in China have given the world too many reasons not to trust them. One need only read the daily newspaper.
1,I'll just say right off the bat that this stickvac is not worth the price.		The 2 main complaints are that it loses the charge much too quickly and it doesn't pick up well. Both of these are obviously very important (missing) features. You need the vac to stay charged long enough to use it and you need it to actually pick stuff up.		This one seems to be very picky about what it wants to pick up and when. There is no sense of it because one minute it will pick up something a little bigger and won't pick up small stuff and the next time you use it, it will be the opposite.		When using it in the kitchen, it didn't want to pick up pieces of grass that had been tracked in by the door. This was not huge clumps of grass, not wet grass, not stuck to the floor grass... just single little pieces of grass scattered on the floor, maybe an inch or two long, at most. It doesn't like to pick up pet hair off of hard floors either. After running the vac, you can still sweep up plenty hair/dust/dirt with the broom.		Some cookie crumbs left by the kids were gone over several times and it still didn't want to pick everything up. Cat litter is iffy - sometimes it will pick it up, sometimes not, and regardless it will always spit some back out at you. No matter what you're vacuuming, it always seems to want to spit some back out at your feet.		The dust cup is small, so even if it does pick up, it can't pick up much at a time.		As a hand vac, it isn't much better at all. The opening at the end is pretty large and circular and it just doesn't do a very good job.		On the brightside, it is very easy to put together. You just attach the handle with a screw. I did it with a butter knife in about 15 seconds. It is fairly slim and easy to store. The swivel head is nice to maneuver the vac around. But, all of these good things do not matter at all if the vac simply does not do what it is supposed to.		For this price, I really expect something much better. The least it could do is work.		I cannot recommend this stickvac. Sad to say, the even more expensive model 240A isn't much better either. I'd scratch both of these off the comparison list and look to other brands.
1,My flexcare was only a few months out of warranty when it stopped working.  Contacted customer service and they said I couldn't send it for repair, but I could buy a new one from their on line store with a 15% discount.  When I pointed out that it was still more $ than what I could buy here on Amazon, they abruptly ended the chat session.  The guys name was Allen and I've never encountered such horrible service.  From reading the other reviews, that is their typical way of treating customers.  I'll never go back to them.
1,These vary in size (loose tolerance) and some may not mate. The plastic is very hard and cracks when you crimp them. I removed the plastic once I found mating pairs then i shrink tubed them.
1,Sticks after a few uses.
1,Pretty cheap stuff, not sure if I can use it for what I had intended to. RC heli stuff. Not really sure what I could use this stuff for???? I had some real heavy duty stuff that the glue failed on fairly quick and the stuff was installed inside the house. I'm living in regret.
1,I bought this tape thinking it would be better than duct tape.  It wasn't.		Yes, Gorilla tape is sticky.  And yes, it's probably stickier than duct tape.  But that doesn't mean it's as strong.		I taped a plastic crate that I use for hauling packages to the Post Office.  The side of the crate had cracked and needed to be repaired.  I used a a good three foot strip of tape that extended half way around the crate.  After a few weeks of use the tape completely failed - it literally split in two like masking tape.  I simply pulled the crate out of the back of my car and one of edges of it (the crate, not the tape) caught on the bottom.  I tugged a little and that little bit of pressure popped the tape right in two as if it were nothing.  I have never seen duct tape behave like this, not once.		One more thing - this tape has a horrible odor.  Think wet dog or old socks stink.  Whatever you use it on will stink for days.		Not sure if I just got a bad roll or if other reviewers used the tape for other purposes.  But there's no way I'd ever buy another roll of this.
1,Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever. In fact they try to give you free fillment for a good review.  Not all the fillment in the world will make me lie about a bad company.
1,These do not use a tb6600 chip.
1,This worked pretty well on some cheap pane glass I got out of a picture frame at the dollar store, however when I tried to used it on higher quality borosilicate glass, the results were not good. When trying to apply, it just beads up like water on the borosilicate glass so it is impossible to lay down an even coat of it.	I tried several times to get this to work but the parts would warp and lift off the bed when using borosilicate glass. Quite a disappointment.
1,Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.
1,Shoddy.  The "hinge" on one of the end supports cracked when I bent it up for assembly.
1,I have a circuit built up to do a couple basic tests on each one.		 12 of them failed the tests in one way or another		 I wrote to seller they advise they was on vac and would take care of this when they get back.. i never heard from them wrote again and they never replied.		the ones that worked are great.. can always use 555 timers..but next time I will be finding another seller..		I used Smiths Depot others seller sell the  same descriptive item this review does not reflect on any other seller
1,Flimsy pieces but they do fit my 1/4 inch hole pegboard well. I like the metal ones better but thought I would give these a try. Good for hanging very lite objects and won't see a lot of use.
1,Not Authentic American terminal branded item. Came in clear unbranded packaging. Fake!!!
1,This is the second roll of this that when it gets down to the middle its all tangled up and because of this ruined a 17 hour long print when that I was 15 hours into. The same thing happened to the first roll but it hapoened on a 19 hour print with only 20nminutes to go. Will never buy this companies products again no quakity control. They are lucky i cannot give them a 1 star for each purchase.		Maybe if they spent less money on putting stickers in the box and more towards properly extruding the filament it would be a better product.
1,PRO - thick tape and 1 day shipping through Amazon Prime (my main reason for purchasing)	CON - Agree with the other buyer and it's not comparable to Scotch.  The adhesive on this tape is not sticky enough and I had some of it lifting off both boxes and kraft envelopes.  Going out to Costco to get some Scotch brand to use on shipping boxes.
1,So if you buy an expensive stethoscope I would not recommend putting this cheap feeling and looking plastic name piece onto it. There are better ways of identifying yours from others.
1,Doesn't work.  I tried to seal off a leaking 1" sprinkler supply pipe (copper).  Sanded and cleaned the area to be patched, made sure it was clean and dry prior to application. Stretched on 3-4 wraps of this 'wonder tape' and it still leaked.  Repeated process but tried more tape, same result.  This stuff is junk.
1,Good product, POS container. Leaks all over the place even with lid on.
1,Just like others, I bought these without reading the reviews. How could a nylon strap be junk, right? Well it is possible! These are too short and thin to be useful. I tried to move a dresser and this lifts it just high enough to sit on your thigh so you get to make short choppy steps the whole way. They also don't provide a lot of vertical support so the dresser felt like it was going to tip the whole time. I too received 2" straps like other reviewers. I wouldn't recommend these at all. Buy lunch for an extra person to help you move instead.
1,I have had terrible luck with this filament.  It has jammed up three separate printers, tends to produce prints with tears/lines in them, and seems overly brittle.  I can't recommend this at all, and am sad to have bought two rolls of the stuff.  Going back to the USA Filament when it becomes available and the Hatchbox stuff which has been good enough.
1,Just as the 100 yellow ones I bought, these are terrible. By 3M so you don't have to return these. The metal housing is way to thin.
1,This didn't have a way of hooking up the PTFE tubing.
1,This material is a bit of a letdown.  I love eSun filaments and print spools a week of ABS.  However the ABS+ doesn't extrude consistently and has a much lower surface quality.  It is however VERY strong and is a lot cleaner printing that Nylon.  I would definitely use it for something I needed a bit of extra strength where a perfect surface didn't matter.  But don't look to replace your beautiful ABS prints with it, its just not up for the job.
1,I've gone through 20 + Rolls of plastic never had a quality problem until I bought two rolls of this cheaper plastic turns out you get what you pay for the quality is terrible I've tried different temps and change the tips on the printer with no help this plastic just prints crappy I went back to the original plastic I've been using for two years and no problems at all. this plastic prints like it has air bubbles in the plastic quality and look of product is very cheap and not useful at all
1,The product itself was OK but it's pretty ridiculous that they don't say you will get separate pieces that add up to 10 ft.. If I order 10 ft., I expect to get 1 piece that is 10 ft. long not one that is a little under 9 ft. and 1 that is a little over 1 ft.. They do not say that in the description. If you used that method they could send you 120 pieces that were 1" long and say you got 10ft..
1,This is the one of worst filaments I have ever had, and I have had some pretty bad stuff. The only reason I got it was I needed it for same day delivery and my normal brands were out of stock.		The spool is a mess, full of tangles, looks like a kid made it. This was not fun getting untangled the first few layers.	I noticed some steam/smoke at first thought it was interesting as usually only filaments like nylon do that. I thought maybe it was just this mixture of pla was like that, but unfortunately it ended up coming out pretty bad.		See the attached picture, as the first layer had huge issues, and I will update this review with more prints.	I average about 15 prints a week, and never have issues like this, using my PEI build plate which is ironically from gizmo dorks.
1,Three Shark Vacs in three years, all have failed. Twitter at Shark will not allow you to leave any negative remarks, this is proof they are falsifying.their reviews.
1,cord started to short out quite easily and never really worked for my 3d printer.	At lest it was cheap...	I hardly moved the cord around and never untied it. somehow it started shorting out when testing it.	Kinda like a crappy phone/power cord would after quite a bit of use, but a lot sooner and less use.
1,These are _terrible_. I've been using them for a day and I hate them. The caps don't seal well, so often times I find myself squeezing and the flow is irregular. there is some sort of joint between the bottle and the nozzle that also leaks at the top, and causes drops to roll down the nozzle and drip on things, which is _terrible_ if you're doing lab work and the outside of the nozzle has dust and hair statically stuck to it, because it gets washed down into what you're washing.		I will be returning these if I can.
1,Not happy with this product at all. Doesn't set well and difficult to even remove cap.  I would not recommend this product.
1,Extremely fragile, for a tow strap you'd think it would be more rugged, it really isn't
1,it works took forever to get
1,These are NOT breadboard friendly. They have short, weak pins that will not stay in your breadboard. The pins break very easily. They also have two annoying mounting ground pins that make it difficult to use on a breadboard, but these can easily be bent back. Uxcell also has no easy way to get datasheets. The encoders also do not have a printed part number. I was able to solder lead wires so i could use them on a breadboard, and they do work properly, however i would not buy these again.
1,Bought a new printer that came with the old extruder. Purchased this and 2 hours into a print job it jammed and now won't load pla at all.
1,wow this stuff sucks it looked decent but I keep running in to problems	#1 it clogs so easily even with oiling	#2 the filament breaks easily	#3 it gets chewed by the extruder in every print	#4 the prints come out with holes and drips (I print at a decently stable 200c)	take my advice and avoid this filament
1,It said it has a shrinkage ratio of 2:1, which is 1/2 of its diameter. I cannot agree with that. It's more like a 2/5. I had a better luck with another brand, which gives me a better shrinkage than it claimed.
1,Didnt stick to plastic or ceramic..
1,Jams constantly.  Threads chowdered up.
1,Too small for some uses. I needed one that would let the water drop farther before turning on. This was only about 1 inch.
1,Apparently, Tapecase can't cut/convert a roll of tape correctly. Or someone was hammered at the die cutter that day, either way, this is getting real annoying considering the typical high-cost of these products.		As measured with a caliper, roll measured .3795 inches on top, which is close enough to what was ordered, HOWEVER the bottom measured .5155 inches with a roll that goes from correct width, to nearly 75% above the correct size. WTF? Can we please learn to cut correctly and stop pawning off your B-stock to Amazon and wasting our time? This one is a first, but not the first time I've seen garbage come out of Tapecase converting 3M stock on Amazon.
1,This does a lot of what it says it will do but for what I've tried it on it just won't stick it will dry but it peels loose with very little effort
1,I'm really dis a pointed with this with this cleaning system. I used to buy the Resolve cans of high traffic carpet cleaner and use my own brush. I thought it would easier which it is the only problem is it only covers 50 sq.ft. I used up a can in no time so I decided to go back to using my carpet brush. It works better for me the carpets came out very clean. Don't get me wrong the Resolve cans by themselves cleans the carpets very well. Do yourself a favor just but the three pack of Resolve carpet cleaner cans and a brush and handle. The other way it will cost you a lot of money using this system.
1,Same as the 3/8 I bough here on amazon.  I flushed my lines before hooking up my new carb and even with gas just flowing through this line ( NO pressure or sitting in line at all ) this line turned the gas BROWN.. there is no way anyone can tell me that poluting gas with whatever is turning it brown in the line is good for jets or injectors. I sent this back , got line from the local parts store and my gas is now crystal clear.		I am so glad I thought to flush the line AND use a glass filter to catch anything in there and LOOK at what was flowing through the lines.		I will NEVER use a Thermoid product again		I put pictures of this here on Amazon but for some reason Amazon is not posting them ?
1,bad, inaccurate, unpredictable, never the same reading twice
1,Is it just a coincidence that this item looks exactly like the item that is being sold as "Ghost Meter"? That one is useless for detecting EMF from a cell phone, and this one probably is just as useless.
1,Unacceptably high number of dud wires due to poor crimping; who/whatever was crimping these did a sloppy job.
1,This Amazon used product arrived with 11 parts missing and the machine doesn't work. Last used anything I buy from Amazon.		I wanted to review this even worse, it is junk, but Amazon keeps telling me I can't say that. The truth is not allowed on reviews.
1,I just opened. Can is only 1/2 full!!!! I feel like I got ripped off!  I would not recommend buying this as either they use a big can fill it half full or it is intend to make you think you got full measure. If this is a mistake I would like a replacement. If not intended, they have QC problems. NOT HAPPY.  Great product but got only 1/2 of what I purchased.
1,Harder to work with and inferior surface finish compared to Hatchbox and Sainsmart TPU.
1,This is a good idea but not a good product. Not reliable and have not been able to use it even tested it on several android devices.
1,This "3-pack" is a misleading description. There were 3 packs but the contents of one entire tube leaked out and caused me to throw all of them away as the contents has been soaked in epoxy. This was a complete waste of money. Look elsewhere.
1,worked for less than a month before it just stopped working.
1,Cheaply made and very flimsy - did not hold the weight indicated. Sagged easily on the corners (where the boxes should have been strongest).		Find a different box solution for your needs.
1,This sheet is undersize. Someone else mentioned this, too. Mine are 1/4" and 3/16" shy of being 12" square. Unfortunately I *do* need the full 12", so this isn't going to work well.		If people have a hard time with their cutting tolerances, they should make sure they err on the large side instead of shafting people.
1,First off, I have TWO of these units, the first I'd purchased from Amazon, the second was a replacement sent free by Amazon when I requested a return on the first due to accuracy issues. I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.		To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.		The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.		FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.
1,Mounting holes are drilled all the way through, but only partially tapped.  M4 taps.  M4 bolts will go in about 11 mm before bottoming out.  I broke a screw off figuring this out during mounting (I assumed the error was misalignment of my mounting holes).  So a thru-hole of about 17.6 mm is tapped just over halfway.  While this may be OK for some mountings, I had to tap out 16 holes just to mount a bed along these rails.  Buyer, beware--another example of Chinese quality....
1,The filament prints well, but the black color is somewhat muddy, sort of a very, very dark gray.  I compared it to some premium filament and it's a significant difference.  Not the first time I've bought discount black filament and experienced this - maybe the manufacturer is saving a bit of money on pigment?
1,I use double sided temporary tape for woodworking and lumber flatting applications. For my need a tape should hold a piece of lumber in place on a flat surface when applying moderate pressure to the opposite side with either a hand or power plane. It fails at this task. It's not very strong and inferior to the temporary tape sold by Home Depot or Lowes.
1,It's a great plastic and prints really well but about 1/4 through the roll mine started breaking due to being rolled up bad. I had to end up baby sitting my printer it kept happening so much i stopped using the roll. It was basically rolled tight and every so often as it was coming off the spool it was under the next layer instead of on top. I've tried  reaching out to solu tech but have yet to hear back. Not sure if I just got a bad spool or if this is common with this brand.
1,I don't understand what is wrong with this product but it is the worst I have ever used. It doesn't melt properly to be used with my printer, it completely clogged the nozzles  EVERY time used and had to be heated to 260 degrees to finally remove it from the print nozzles for the fifteenth time! Complete waste of my TIME and money!
1,Piece of junk, ordered 2 one fell apart in 2 days. NO roughor heavy usage.
1,Screen goes crazy once it hits 100mm mark 1to99 works fine. Pretty disappointing.
1,Crap.  Doesn't fit my shop vac hose and Amazon wouldn't take it back, so I literally bought it and threw it in the trash.
1,I'm using this for my Prusa i3. The glass is thicker on the center which makes bed leveling impossible. The edge of larger prints always peels up. :(
1,Not focusable like they claim.
1,The silver color is so crappy, I haven't been able to print anything decent with it. I think it's just a problem with the silver, the prints fail every time. Black and lime green work great though.
1,to fragile
1,In the end I got these to work, but they're pretty poor. I had to use a pair of pliers to force fuses into them, even the ones they included. It was completely impossible to get them into the fuse holder on my new Ford vehicle. I had to file the ends down and also narrow the ends quite a bit with a rough file before they would fit.
1,High-priced cheap quality
1,Bought two - just quit working and company would not back them so they are in my scrap pile - worthless. Poor design and customer service.
1,It arrived with the protective lens rattling around inside the housing and the rest of the emitter loose inside as well. Amazon refunded my money without a problem but I ended up replacing it with a different make/model, Fluke 62 Max (which isn't comparable in price or build quality at all)
1,These were fairly low quality connectors. Not quite what I was looking for.
1,This DOES NOT work in the Stanley Bostitch hammer stapler that takes the H30-8 staples
1,It is a decent printer, not the best resolution, but for the money, it's a functional 3d printer.  It get's errors from time to time, but CS has been 'helpful' in fixing them.  I have found that 3rd party forums are a better source of info though.  The CS from XYZ is quite demanding in their info requests, ie 4-5 emails a day demanding serial numbers from various locations on the printer.		The filament cartridges are a joke though.  They are proprietary and of poor quality.  There was a common practice of resetting the cartridges using a resetter, but now the latest firmware update prevents this.  It remotely reports back to XYZ what you have been printing and if they detect you are using a reset cartridge, they remotely disable your printer.  That's right, they intentionally brick your printer.		Can anyone say class action?
1,I was only able to to try it on the one device I needed it to work for (digital coax out of the TV to an optical in on a soundbar).  It didn't work, despite the fact that all 3 optical cables I tried (one very basic black plastic one, one more flexible plastic, and one glass) had red light coming out of it, and all three cables work in other applications.		Dunno if I got a dud or not, but it wasn't worth the hassle of returning.
1,I bought this a few months ago, and already doesn't work. The seller, Chaney Instruments, should refund my money. I never dropped it or mishandled it. It is only 2 months hold, yet it doesn't work any longer. The numbers on it or all distorted. Even when it did work, it didn't make sense. It would show my lowest temperature recorded inside my place at 72 degrees F, yet when looking at my current temp, it showed 68. Go figure.
1,We had a leak in the main water lines to the house (1/2 inch). The leak was at a straight connector on the pipe. The tape was put on, then covered with a rubber sleeve and then clamps used to hold all in place. The pressure of the water cased the tape to bubble up and eventually let water through. We went though the process again and this time increased the thickness of the tape. While it held for a few minutes the tape would not hold enough to prevent the loss of water. IT may have worked on a  really low pressure water line however not on a main water line to my house. We still have most of the roll which we will use in the future for very small leaks and see if the tape will hold. We had to call a plumber which we intended to do so anyway as this tape was only temporary to get us through the week end.
1,This item listing is obviously broken. I received a 5mm to 8mm coupling.	I'm sorry this listing wasted my time while I'm trying to repair my printer.
1,It's a good product, while it lasts. The brush battery died after two years and two months of use. You guessed it, two year warranty, and they weren't willing to do anything besides a $5 rebate (!) in compensation. Two year warranty or not, that is not long enough for a cordless brush.
1,Terrible filament. Breaks about every 1/2 to 1 meter spoiling prints. I've used about a third of the spool and rarely am able to complete a successful print due to filament breaking. I've had generally good success with Hatchbox filaments but am now concerned about purchasing the Hatchbox brand in the future..
1,Way too runny to use for much of anything, more like syrup than silicone like it should be.	Not sure if I can return it just because it sucks?	Also didn't dry in the 4 hours I had the door clamped closed gasket came right off when the door opened.
1,I purchased these to store acrylic paints for my 25mm miniatures. They seemed to work great at first. I do not recommend them for this, or any purpose.		The lid is cheaply made and if over-tightened just slightly, it will crack the very top part of the cap off. If the lid doesn't fail (more often than not it will) then the nipple dropper insert will split and cause it to leak everywhere and clog the lid.		The bottles themselves seem to made of decent material but the lid and nipple insert are cheap garbage. I now have to replace all of them and potentially throw out some of my paints.
1,I had wondered why my very expensive sapplings were dying since I was monitoring them so closely.  After reading reviews about this montor, I checked the digital readout for temperature against that of several very dependable thermometers and this instrument reads 5 DEGREES TOO LOW!  I was cooking my sapplings because I thought the temperature was low enough to keep them out of the risk of harm.  I do not know about the hygrometer; but, if the reading were important to me, I would also check it against other reliable sources.  These reviews helped me find the deadly link in my plant growing setup.  The temperature gauge was very inaccurate!
1,does not work well
1,I love the slots for holding the bag in place. Nice purchase; just wish the lid for this didn't cost more than the can (from most sellers), itself. two stars removed for that "bait and switch" type marketing disgrace.
1,I am a little disappointed with these Taps as the openings where you place the fuses are defective in 3 of the 5 that were sent to me.  It makes it  extremely difficult to push in the fuse.  I managed to move it a little and did get the fuse in but other people may not be so lucky.  I tried to take a few photos but may be hard to see this.  The quality of the area that holds the fuses is not good :-(
1,worked fine for about a month, but hasn't kept accurate temp for at least a week. now some portions of digits not displaying. and reading 10F indoors. actual temp is about 70F. tried new batteries. same exact result. can't return after 30 days - i tried. also, the INCREDIBLY SMALL DISPLAY on this thing isn't much larger than a book of matches. definitely wouldn't buy again. i tend to like Amazon recommendations, but ended up with a real dud, this time.
1,Bought two of these (cheap in price) units.  Have them side by side.  One can say 53% humidity and it's High, the other reads Low.  One reads 59 for temp and  the other 54.  So precision is not seen in these units, then again, neither is a high cost.  So maybe you get what you pay for?  Wish I knew which was accurate.  I believe the temp (and possibly humidity) is a 24hr history.  I've seen mine have a low temp of 54 and the next day a low temp of 58.
1,Its cheaply made and you can barely make anything out. I bought this for my medical kit because my girlfriend and I have a few health issues. I needed to use it on her one night but couldn't hear anything. I'll have to buy something else and toss this one. I need something that's actually going to work in an emergency.
1,I didn't buy this for any immediate need, rather an ongoing use as needed. I haven't had a chance to actually measure a bore yet but, It COULD earn another star if only it had instructions in English.
1,Try as I may, getting the size I wanted failed. These tiny hooks are NOT for cups, unless you want hooks for kid's tea party cups. The gap for cup handles is a mere 12/32.  The gauge of the brass-colored material is close to that of 12 gauge wire, but a tad thicker, by actual measurement.  The overall length from tip to tip is 1 1/4 inches. The wood threads are close to that of a #4 wood screw, so that tells you how small these things are.
1,Doesn't fit the tv jack
1,I received the tape today and I immediately noticed it was way too thin to be 2.7mils so I measured it with a high precision micrometer and it's 1.1 mils. Even the original product description on the 3M site says 1.4mils (Attached screenshots). The thickness is NOT 2.7mil as stated so it's false advertising. I even paid same day delivery because I needed it badly. I'm so disappointed.
1,Esun recently posted material specs on intservo's site.  I've printed with their Blu black red and magenta.  Based on color the materials properties vary widely.  Solid red is a dark pink when printed.  It doesn't have the same material strength the other colors have.  When the first part broke I printed 3 times.  All three broke.  So I printed in the magenta instead and that didn't break and is still holding strong.  The makes me worries that whatever they use to make it opaque or use to make it red (without looking magenta) is to blame.  At this point I have had problems with 2 out of 4 colors.  I think esun needs to learn that the chemistry of the plastic isn't enough dyes can affect it too.  Except for the Black (which is perfect) and blue ( strong and really good color but nasty vapors) ill go back to colorfabb xt.
1,This don't waste your money , Should be a Law made if you sell this Cheap Crap
1,Hello fellow Amazonians:	We purchased a number of these items based on the seemingly positive reviews it has. Unfortunately, they were constructed with poor quality materials and rather shoddily put together. I wish we had an option of not buying poorly made Chinese made products or products other countries who don't really have our interests in mind other than to sell thing to us. Unfortunately we'll be returning these items in search of a better quality product state side. Shame.
1,Expect the last quarter of Hatchbox PLA to just shatter and fall apart as shown is this photo. This PLA gets brittle and is wound too tight so it just falls apart when you get any where near the end of the spool.
1,It really does clean well but the plastic they use feels so thin and brittle.  I think for this price, it should be built like a tank.  I will update this review if something breaks.		UPDATE DEC 2016	After owning it less than a year, and with very light use, several of the brittle plastic parts have broken or snapped off. Now if you try to pull off the canister, dust will just explode everywhere. AVOID THIS UNIT.  Dyson uses very cheap plastic. It really feels like a cheap toy. I will never buy Dyson again.  I should not have donated my Kemore which i have had for 10 years with no fail.
1,Get clumpy prints.		The thing is I get good results and then suddenly bad results in the same roll
1,Can't say I was happy with this unit.  It came NOT WORKING, with the LCD screen compromised and half black, and so much interior corrosion that the battery prong came off in my hand.....Obviously used and returned.  My last time I'll buy my meter on line...
1,This tape is very very thin in does not stick very well the one I got before this one what's the same has Hurley nonstick and does not stay on things that well I taped it on cardboard box it would not stay stuck if I could return it I would because it's no good to stay I talk to my roommate he said this tape is more for using into meet market on meat packaging it Is not very good Dottie and I'll the yellow tape that bought has excellent stick in Hall's up a long time I cannot recommend this tape here to anyone it will keep your packages Secure it works on paper but on anything else it does not have a good stick and Rich too easy sincerely William Tyler
1,Warps after a short while and renders your print bed unprintable
1,Description is wrong, this isn't made in the USA, it's made in china. None of the accuracy specifications are correct either.		Amazon needs to properly catalog these items.
1,I purchased this because if was supposed to remove graffiti from concrete. We had a eight foot section of a concrete retaining wall spray painted with red paint by some hoodlums. I followed the instructions precisely. Then I tried a second and third application. I was not able to get one piece of the graffiti removed. It is imbedded in the concrete. Has been on about three weeks. I wanted this to work but looks like it is not going to happen. Cannot recommend for concrete. Perhaps it would have worked on some other surface, at least the reviews say it will.
1,Any idea why this won't adhere to Kapton?	I've run numerous other brands and they all adhere fine.  This will not adhere at all.
1,These do NOT fit standard receptacles and outlets at stated.  You need 6-32.  These Work:	http://www.amazon.com/Gardner-Bender-SK-632T-Screw-Phillips/dp/B00ATODOQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1454776638&sr=1-2&keywords=6-32+screws
1,The dropper mechanism is non-functional, and the "ground" glass interface is not tight enough to stop evaporative loss. I also believe the glass to be improperly annealed based on breakage from other items shipped to me.
1,The label is plastered right on the plastic tube - you peel it off and you're left with a layer of adhesive you can't see through.  I sent it back.
1,Total scam and a rip off
1,HORRIBLE product/ NASTY toxic smell. and the dispenser is Worthless
1,cheap P.O.S.
1,I suppose that there are windows out there that actually require such a wide spline. Unfortunately for me, none of my 30-plus window and door screens do - and my house is only 13-years old. I ended up returning these splines.
1,Dosnt seal
1,Very deceitful ad It shows six rolls of tape and when you get the product there is only one. The picture is the only description and so you believe it to be accurate. Especially since there is no way to select the color, I guess they just send whatever is the least popular color. I got Orange. Useless  Very disappointed with fraudulent seller.
1,SUPER GARBAGE.  I'm not expecting a Littman or professional quality stethoscope, by the way.  I have significant medical experience, and actually one steth. I use is actually really cheap, but it works well.  I'm getting these for students of a class.... but when I tried to use one, it was HORRIBLE.  Very muffled heart sounds -- don't waste your time & money.		Furthermore, this company is now asking me to PAY FOR SHIPPING ($10.18)-- even though when I bought them it was with "free shipping."  This is in ADDITION TO THE 15% RESTOCKING FEE.  How they can retroactively ask for shipping is beyond me.  Whoever runs this company, I hate them!  I'm contacting amazon, and I'll update this review as to the conclusion.		In the mean time, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!
1,Extremely weak magnets, fall out of your vise very easily
1,Doesn't work well for me (using Flashforge Creator Pro with PEI bed). First layer doesn't stick well and lamination is not good. I tried different temperatures (up to 240c) but still not good. I had better success with other non black filaments from Hatchbox and  IC3D. I recently gravitate more and more to Hatchbox ABS filaments, better price and so far they all gave me very good printing results.		Edit: added a picture with sample prints with Hatchbox yellow, IC3D red, IC3D blue and IC3D black (the subject of my review). The IC3D black I got underperforms consistently, except for very simple models.
1,C-
1,Medline customer support advises me that the product is not sterile, and intended for use only on scrapes and minor wounds. Customer service advises that it is not suitable for use on serious or surgical wounds. Thus to label the bottle label "Wounded Cleanser" is false and misleading.
1,worked fine for about a month, but hasn't kept accurate temp for at least a week. now some portions of digits not displaying. and reading 10F indoors. actual temp is about 70F. tried new batteries. same exact result. can't return after 30 days - i tried. also, the INCREDIBLY SMALL DISPLAY on this thing isn't much larger than a book of matches. definitely wouldn't buy again. i tend to like Amazon recommendations, but ended up with a real dud, this time.
1,This missed a 5 star rating as ALL of the tubes I got were marked GREY but the product in a couple of the tubes was WHITE. Had to go over the white with the grey. Terrible product control. Self leveling yes but can be very messy. It will also take a huge amount of this product if you have a deep gap as it seeps down to infinity.
1,Bought three spools, two white and a black. The black jammed half way through the roll, diameter of filament is inconsistent. Was sent a feedback form around the same time of the jam, when I went to leave a negative review I was prompted to contact customer support - well they didn't bother getting back to he so here you go. Nothing worse than a filament that ruins a six hour print job, will never buy again.
1,I ordered 2 rolls. 1 roll was wound uneven on the roll and horrible to use the red cover came off and the clear tape was stuck to one another on the sides.the other roll not as bad but the same situation.
1,Had there previous model for years of trouble free use. Left cheap batteries in too long without checking & they corroded so bought this latest version. Whoever thought the constant blink, just to let you know its working, obviously wasn't a working electrician. There should be a way to check then switch the blink off. Its sooooo annoying. I am actually taping up the most of the tip just leavening enough to see when hot wire detected. There are just some thing that don't need improving so I will search for the old model even used it would be better that blinking - EVERY 2 SECS for goodness sake.
1,DO NOT BUY....IT VIBRATES HARD AND KNOCKS AGAINST YOUR TEETH......NOT SURE BUT IT MIGHT DAMAGE ENAMEL ON TEETH.
1,The worst tape I have ever bought.  This is NOT duct tape.  It is just thin palstic tape with no cloth backing.  Scotch should relable this as "The Cheap Stuff, Not Duct Tape".  Look elsewhere for duct tape.
1,keeps breaking
1,The filament was visibly tangled and kinked on the spool when I received it. My review is based solely upon that at this point. I'm attempting to print with it now, but I have very little hope as im sure the tangles will cause the filament to break or pull out of the extruder during the print. I will never buy this again and id advise not to take the chance on it.
1,Prints are decent...however terribly coiled in the reel.  Continued getting tangled throughout the prints.  As a result, it created endless jams.
1,Original Review:	LED uses less power than incandescent versions. If not tightly closed, it can flicker a bit, so only 4 stars.		Revision:	After very mild field use (Standby as an EMT), the top cap came unglued and popped off. Luckily I found the spring in my pocket and super glued it and the cap back on. It's functional, but the LED in the tip of the unit is not stationary and can move around. Because of that, sometimes it is very dim until moved the LED is moved a mm or so, then it goes back to full brightness again. I like LED vs. Incandescent, but this is a poorly made product and should be avoided.
1,I used Zen's Natural PLA and loved it, so I ordered their black PLA.  USELESS.  I tried many temperatures, and it always plugs the nozzle.  After about 30 plugs and ZERO successful prints I drilled out the extruder body.  It still plugged repeatedly.  I wonder if they take advantage of the black color to hide fillers in it?  DO NOT BUY.
1,Not sure what it fits? I have two versatile staple guns and this ammo is not for any of them.
1,Product is as described. Connected Win 7 installed it with no cd.		The camera is large. The cable is soft. The brightness adjust does little. Picture is very low res. Does not look waterproof, and not willing to try.		Oh, and the cd was blank.		Would not buy another.
1,It is a waste of money. The shapes are not imaginative. They are plain and boring. The refill kit is fine and has a high quality refills for a 3D Doodler pen. The green shape plates are too plain in design. They are also absolutely unnecessary. Any child can copy, draw, and trace such simple shapes using a piece of paper and a 3d doodler. It is irresponsible use of plastics that pollutes our environment. These will be used a few times and tossed to landline.
1,While the device can work as advertised, the output is worthless for realtime data streaming.  Reading output is a surprisingly unpredictable at 2-8 seconds, and accuracy isn't stellar.  My purchase lasted 3 weeks, then poof ... unreadable.  I am sorry I made the purchase.		Rather than wasting money on a DHTxx series sensor, it is best to advance straight to the more rugged next generation Bosch BME280 with reliable 20 ms I2C read times, and measuring 3 parameters: temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.  The BME280 readings are precise (cv = 0.08), and my specimens have been accurate within 1% of NIST calibrated references.
1,Bought this product to eliminate tools on a 4" dryer duct. So imagine my surprise that the size 60 clamp is just a hair too small to easily fit over the slightly larger outer diameter of flexible semi-rigid dryer ducting. A really genius idea would be to make one (embossed-type) clamp size that works for 3-6 inch semi-rigid flex duct. 2.5 - 7 inch capacity outta do it. Yeah there are universal kits but not embossed. Guess I'll use a regular stainless hose clamp and a screwdriver / socket before using these. Here is an embossed clamp version that should work nicely. HPS EMSC-100-120x2 Stainless Steel Embossed Hose Clamps, SAE 64, 4" - 4-1/2
1,Adhesive is perfectly acceptable, but the tubes are very risky to work with. I've had one explode out the back and one spring a leak in the side.
1,Was way too big for the cr10-s so dontvwast your time orm$$$
1,it's very unresponsive to changes in temperature or humidity. I'm beginning to question its overall accuracy.		Good to use to get an idea of the temperature or humidity of somewhere if you let it sit for a couple hours to equalize, but not useful for short-term purposes like testing out an AC system in a small room.
1,The first 6 prints or so were excellent, I thought I had a winner.  Had to return it.  Bed would not level so the first layer would sick.  Back right corner just like all for forums say.  Spent many hours trying to get it to work.
1,Quite surprisingly, the kit contained the exact inventory of parts needed to build the scope.  Assembled with no problem.  The display did light, but would not perform beyond that.  I checked all the voltage test points and all voltages checked out OK.  I wound up filing it in the garbage.
1,Wanted to remove some polyps... very dull
1,I could not get it to work. I sent it back.
1,This funnel I received has broken stem. Upon closer inspection I noticed a white ring of residue on the inside of the funnel. So not only was it broken, it was used too!
1,Poor quality connectors don't waste your money.
1,CAN NOT MAKE IT WORK
1,I read the reviews and noted the scope worked great and was a nice "adult" size.  I was thrilled because it's a needed item and in my daugther's favorite color.  In the end, the scope really isn't long enough to work comfortably on patients and the sound wasn't the best either.  When outside noises are a distraction, the scope isn't the best. My daughter uses her scope everyday and needs quality not novelty.  I returned this item with no trouble at all from the vendor --- but in the end, you get what you pay for. This, unfortuantely is $20 for orange rubber....
1,don't waste your money half of them don't even work and the other half are very erratic.
1,Poor quality inconsistent size
1,These came in a bag that was a quarter full and had a clean cut just under the ziplock. There are probably loose connectors all over the shippers floor. "100 count" bag had a total of 40 connectors in it. They still shipped it. Total of ONE yellow conn...
1,As a vacuum pump it sux, but I haave a pretty good 12V motor now..
1,Worked for a week or so.  Now it kind of turns itself on and off at random as I'm using it.  Rarely able to get a useable reading.
1,The advertisement says this unit was rated by the "Japanese Consumer Protection Agency" but a web search does not reveal such an organization.  Can not verify the claim.
1,I bought 14 of these for production of parts for my company and I regret the day I made the decision.  Expect to replace wiring harnesses and motors and main boards weekly.  These machines do not hold up to normal use let alone high volume production.  When they work they work well but when I own 14 of them and they are all breaking daily then there is a problem.  Don't expect to get ahold of anyone at the 800 number they never answer.  When you email them expect broken English responses where they don't understand simple English and it takes a week to get the problem worded in a way they understand.  THEN THEY TELL YOU TO SHIP THEN BACK AT YOUR EXPENSE FOR REPAIR!!  These things weigh a lot so expect to pay $75 plus to ship to California and hope it doesn't get damaged in transit to them because they WILL NOT REPAIR IT!!  Also do not use their filament it's terrible.  If you dare to buy one of these cheaply built machines buy a cartridge reset offline.  What they charge is highway robbery.  You can buy hatchbox filament for $22 for a 2 pound roll versus $28 for a one pound roll.  The reason the machines are so cheap was they figured they would get you to buy the product and rape us all on filament.  I also own flash forge machines and would recommend if you want one that never breaks get one or else expect to be waiting for emails from xyzprinting for a week or longer and expect each time it breaks down to be offline a solid 2 weeks each time.  I submitted an issue yesterday again and still no response.  It took them 24 hours to copy and paste what I emailed them to their online system that has code written by a child who does not understand how to design a intuitive user friendly website.
1,Stay away from velcro, it won't remain in place and falls off easily
1,This reads a different temperature and humidity than my thermostat when sitting right below it.
1,Will not fit Walmart 5 gal plastic water fug.
1,After reading all the good reviews I was surprised when they arrived. I have several Nicholson files and they look and cut great. These Mexican knock off were not up to the Nicholson name. The reviews that had such high star reviews must not have used a genuine (Made in USA) Nicholson files before, because there is no comparison. They did have nice handles and pouch they came in.
1,Completely useless. The interior diameter varies throughout the entire tube leading to clogs. I've cut it into pieces, but the diameter varies so much throughout that even finding a good 30mm out of the entire 2 meters was a frustrating task.		Whats with all the crap products for 3d printing flooding amazon lately? There used to be such better consistency with products.
1,These are narrower than my machine. I have other C-folds from other companies and will use them instead.
1,Excellent product, packaging, and shipping.  There are no defects in any of the bottles or droppers, and I really like that they were in separate packages so the rubber on the syringes don't degrade as fast.		Edit:  I put oils in some of the bottles, and just a couple of days later all of the syringes had degraded and the oils were black from the rubber pieces.  I'm not sure what you can use these for since they're not safe to put anything in you plan to ingest, and anything else will be ruined by the rubber.  I'm out $80 and extremely angry at the lack of QC.  The picture provided shows the rubber from the dropper stuck to the bottle.
1,Seems like it should be a good unit but I think corners are cut on the $399 Amazon version. The z axis has 2 motors one is stronger than the other causing constant problems (wants to print crooked the higher you print. The 8x9x10 inch build volume is a lie - 9.5inches at best before skipping teeth (crashing) - z really didn't work on mine but once it is up to the top you have wires dragging- unprintable - basicly mechanicaly crashes before hitting the described dimensions (yes I zeroed the home position accurately and checked all the endstops - even had to fix one z stop that was knocked off in shipping. The heat on the plate is 8x8... Not a noob with 3D printing - corners cut on mechanics and the build volume 8x9x10 impossible on this machine.
1,Works but are not the best calipers. These are loose and catchy. Cheaply made and I admit it is reflected in the price. I would recommend buying a more expensive, better built set.
1,There is a rod that guides the clamp which runs in the center of the open clamp. On my second time to use the clamp I never felt it when I drilled through it. It's a fatal flaw in my opinion. Definitely wouldn't recommend for anyone to purchase this item.
1,I unboxed the device, turned it on, and it seemed to work. I exposed it to a sample of ore which had been measured at 750 cpm of Beta, the seller said. I put that sample on the deice - nothing. I then exposed the device to an air cleaner filter - a low level source. Nothing.	The output of the device fluctuates up and down even if the sensor is blocked with metal or other objects.	This does not seem to sensing anything, and I can't get different readings from concrete walls, carpets, or other items.	In other words, this does not seem to measure anything with any sensitivity.	This might be a bad tube, so I'm sending it back. I had hoped that it would respond, but was disappointed.		I gave it 2 stars, but it was worthless, I'm sorry to say. I am developing radiation detectors, and hoped for a device to calibrate against, but will look elsewhere.
1,Failed in less than a year.  The unit can't remain plugged into the charger per the instructions.  There shouldn't be a device on the market without this simple battery charger shutoff circuit built in.  Stopped charging fully and there for working.  Tossed it.
1,DIDN'T NEED.  NOW IT'S A PAPER WEIGHT!
1,I have an XL2 and these don't fit my oreck at all.
1,When I received these self locking plastic bags the useable size was not 3 inches by 4 inches. The actual size of the opening below the zip lock was 3 inches wide by 3.5 inches high.
1,These test leads were way too wimpy for automotive use. Ifter a couple of them pulled apart then I just threw the rest of them out. Low grade product.
1,These are the worst. They look lke they are use burnt marks on the clips.
1,Sticky back didm;t last more than 2 months.
1,As other reviewers have noted, this thing is not accurate. Compared to other hygrometers, it gives very inaccurate readings. Cheap, disappointing, prolly made in China...
1,I am within my 30 days and am returning this item.  XYZ has some great printers out there - this is not one of them!  Mine was poorly constructed (the feed tube will not stay in place) and even though the box was in perfect shape it has not printed anything except the demo projects.  the one project I tried to print has failed every time about 2/3 of the way into a 8 hour build!  Now the XYZ software is shutting down when I try to send a design to the printer.  I am hoping I just have a bad printer and some conflicting software drivers but even after removing the printer and all drivers and software from my pc and reinstalling I cannot get anything to load.  The downside of this is I really enjoy using the XYZ printer at my college lab.  I was really looking forward to the laser engraver addition but now looks like separate 3-d printer and laser engravers.
1,Twice I ordered these and twice I received brass, roundhead woodscrews. Sent the first order back, but when I received the same thing the second time, decided that it wasn't worth the hassle.
1,I thought these babies were chemical resistant! They are not. The spray mechanism no longer functions after a few weeks with alloy wheel spray. Worked good for a month though.
1,Meh
1,Guess I was expecting more for the price. Could have had a piece cut at my box store for half the price
1,returned it....couldn't get a level mount
1,Bought three of these. (2) thousands and a tenths. Two have failed after 6 months of daily use due to un-fixable sticking. All ended up with unacceptable dead zone (stylus movement with no needle movement).
1,Leaks all over when you open it. Smells bad and the odor won`t go away.
1,Terrible. Wasn't even able to close the box using high end rg6 cable. If the cable is high quality the fitting will be too big to shut.
1,Bought one bottle... fabric beaded like crazy to rain. Impressed,  I bought 10 bottles to do all patio furniture. Almost $200 with tax/shipping but if it worked, $2000 of furniture could last longer. Sadly... only 3 days later furniture was no longer beading. I wonder how many positive reviewers found out this product didn't last but a few days... try it for yourself but "I told you so".
1,Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.
1,These balls were rusty right out of the package.  If you want rusty chrome-plated ball bearings, these are the ones to get.
1,THIS PRODUCT STATES IT CAN BE USED ON RV'S AND SOME APPLIANCES.  WELL IF YOU READ ALL OF THE INFORMATION (WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT ON AMAZON) THEN YOU CAN SEE IT ACTUALLY IS ONLY FOR RV'S.
1,to thin
1,I don't normally leave reviews and when I have they have never been a low review. This is great product but it's knotted throughout the roll which requires refilling the entire spool. I've had knots before but nothing like this mess.
1,Will not stick to metal bicycle parts!
1,Will return. Does not change the fan speed as desired.
1,My Monoprice printer clogged twice in three prints.  I theory is that this plastic doesn't remelt very well, so what is left in the	extruder after a print won't remelt for the next print.  Anyway, I returned the spool, I think I'm going to stick with Hatchbox.
1,I thought I was getting at least a good bargain at 14.99 for 1kg as solutech filament is not the best out there, but for half a kg, It's not really worth the cost, but I needed a black asap and it was available. For the quality of solutech filament I have gotten so far, I think 1kg should range 14-16$ and half a kg should be 8-10$, that would make it at least a cheap alternative to better brands at the same cost.
1,I was so hopeful that this would be the vacuums of all vacuums, but after using it less than a handful of times I'm very disappointed.		Pros:	 - It's small and lightweight	 - uhm, it's small and lightweight...	- Okay, it is fairly quiet as any "duster" vacuum would be...		Cons:	 - When attempting to empty the canister the debris and "yuck" just stays stuck in it.  I shook the canister many times to get it out but the debris barely moves.  There is really no way to get a firm hold on the canister to shake it.  I ended up needing to hold the canister upside down between my knees (so the opening is facing up) and dig it out with my hands.  I'm a transplant patient who has a low immune system and I really need to be careful of germs and dust.  This was NOT fun to do!  I used to own a Shark canister and both ends opened up on the canister so that you could push the debris through if it got stuck.  Most of the debris I vacuum up is cat hair... and this is after all made for pets, but only if you have pets that barely shed... Maybe I should try to find a good lightweight bagged vacuum because not many upright bagless work well with pet hair?	- The power is not as strong as I thought it would be.  It's great on hard surfaces, but poor suction on carpet.  It barely lifts the pile.  I need to go over items several times before it will pick up.  I want a vacuum to be strong enough to pick up small tufts of cat hair without the need to break my arm doing it...	- You would think a vacuum of this price and reputation would have a way to attach the cord higher up so that it does not get caught up under the wheels... just sayin'	- Using the hose is a nightmare!  Most vacuums with hoses are pretty easy to unhook the hose, vacuum up what you need with the hose then attach it again to continue with your job...  This hose is inside or part of the handle, and the difficult part is getting the hose back IN the handle after using it.  Then while the hose is out the vacuum is so lightweight it is not steady.  It literally feels like when you unhook the hose that the vacuum is falling apart.	- It does not do good on edges.  The power just doesn't seem strong enough to pick up even a small piece of paper unless it's directly under it.	- The canister is very small and needs dumped out after vacuuming 2-3 rooms.	-  It is expensive for what you get.  Definitely not a powerhouse vacuum for daily use unless you have VERY little to clean up.  I'm a clean person and I don't let things get too bad, but living in a state with a lot of dust and "nature" blowing in, it is a constant battle...		I really really really wanted to like this vacuum!!!! I've heard only good things about this brand.  I have debated whether to send it back or not.  It is not easy for me to box it up and get it shipped back due to my failing health.  I may just have to keep my older Hoover Windtunnel bagged for heavy jobs (which is highly rated from ASPCA for pets) and this one for light days and dusting the ceiling fans.  But, it is kinda high priced for that.  And, I shouldn't have to keep 2 vacuums.  If the Hoover was lighter I wouldn't have even considered the Dyson actually....	I do feel badly that I cannot give higher marks for this... I truly wanted to say it's the best vacuum I've over owned...
1,Bad knock-offs and NOT the tweezers pictured. They are smaller, and made of soft cheap metal, with lousy tolerances at the tips, and even worse machining, and have no markings of any kind unlike the Vetus tweezers in the pictures where the name has been photoshopped out.		I am surprised they survived the shipping.
1,Much larger and heavier than expected.  Was going to use to help precisely place 2 cars in a smaller home garage.  Cones were in the way all the time because they were too large.  Took up too much garage room and had to be frequently moved and then realigned.
1,This did not work for me at all.  I was attempting to fix a cracked piece of PVC irrigation line.  I followed the directions exactly.  However, it did not hold up.  The water leaked right through.  Maybe it will work for something that doesn't require it to be water tight, but it sure enough did not work for me.
1,The picture of this product is very misleading.		The heat shrink on the far left appears to be a large size. It's actually not large at all the pieces on the right-hand side are just extremely small		Additionally the heat shrink appears to be of mediocre to poor quality.		Go ahead and spend some money and get the 3M brand
1,Very difficult to change spool, entire assembly has to come apart. I decided to print my own with 608 bearings.
1,This stuff just doesn't behave like PETG. As others have described, it doesn't bridge well and it is extremely brittle, far worse so than even cheap PLA. I've got 4 other rolls of ESUN filament on hand and this spool/packaging looks the same as the others, but this stuff came with 2 color pamphlets which have lots of spelling errors. None of the other ESUN products I've ordered have had these pamphlets, but this is the latest order so perhaps they just started adding them? The bag the spool was in still had vacuum, the filament doesn't pop like it has been water damaged and the manufacture date shows as 2017-11-04 so it isn't old either. I tried temperatures from 230-250 and it is beautifully shiny but very brittle no matter what temperature. If you want shiny black filament for a display piece this might be up your alley, but if strength of the finished parts is important to you I can't recommend the Black ESUN PETG. This is the worst filament I have ever used, and that includes the cheap junk they include in the box with cheap printers.
1,Very poorly and imprecisely made...sharp edges. These are absolutely worthless and as fast as I can get the return labels printed, I am returning these...
1,How can people be promoting this glue like this? People are becoming ILL from using this. Plus, it does not work very well! I have used this glue on crystal, metal, plastic and glass. It can easily be pulled apart by a child. --Even though, it should NEVER BE USED IN A HOME WITH CHILDREN! .. Please, please, use something else!!! Otherwise, use a respirator. There are other reviewers who say they use a respirator (not just a simple fume mask. A respirator.) ..But why use something that requires a respirator?! .. Please use something else.		Good luck, friends. I hope that you can find an alternative. Two-part epoxies are waaaay better, by the way! "Devcon 2-Ton" is clear and is is waaaay stronger, with just about no small at all.
1,Chemical Guys sprayers are the WORST.  The stems are too long for the 16oz sprayer so they pinch and fold over in the bottom of the bottle.  After a few refills the stem breaks at the crease and no longer reaches the bottom of the bottle.  After contacting Chemical Guys I was told that what I'd witnessed "doesn't happen" and was told that their bottles "worked perfectly fine".  Pitiful product and worse "customer service".	If you do get stuck with this bottle, you can order 6mm OD x 4mm ID Polyethylene flexible tubing, and you can cut a correct dip tube length.
1,1 week and all rusty
1,OK glove, but fingers are not textured which is a definite disadvantage for me.  Otherwise, fit and finish is good and over 9 inches in length.
1,Way too flimsy for 3D printing removal tools.  Maybe the smallest one can be useful in some cases, but the larger ones  do not have the rigidity required for raft removal.
1,MY BAD, i ordered the wrong part.. 1/4" is not a standard.. know the size..	For me it was refrigerator water line.. different completely
1,After applying the thinnest layer possible to my PLA prints, the coating felt extremely tacky even after several days.  It did not sand well at all.  The two bottles were also 15-20% empty when I received them.		Maybe I just got a bad batch?
1,This is the first time I've ever used gaffer tape, so I don't have much to compare it to. At first I was impressed- I liked the look and feel of the material,  it tore relatively easily and cleanly by hand, and seemed sturdy. Unfortunately, the adhesive is much weaker than any duck tape I've used. I understand that the tape is supposed to be easier to remove, and not leave residue, which was the main appeal of gaffer tape to me, but I still expected the adhesive to be strong. So I don't know if this is the fault of this particular brand of tape, or if this is how gaffer tape is 'supposed to be'.. Maybe more experienced users of gaffer tape can comment.		To illustrate, I've attached two photos of the peeling tape. I tried to repair the cheap vinyl (I think) fabric of my desk chair, which had several tears. I made sure the surface was clean, and pressed down all the edges of the tape firmly, but the peeling started almost immediately. In a few spots it's sticking well, but most are not- perhaps it only works well with flat, relatively smooth surfaces?		I still think this tape will be useful for other purposes, and I may add another star as I have more experience with it. But for now, based on this one repair, I'm disappointed in this product.
1,Difficult to calibrate. Directions clearly aren't written by a native english speaker. I finally was able to get it to read 6.86, but seriously doubt the accuracy. Buy a better unit!
1,I am extremely disappointed with these.  When they first arrived, I was impressed... each comes in it's own very professional sleeve box, and then even boxed together as a set.  And the material seemed very professional and well crafted.		Ive read a lot about how these things won't even lie flat (warped). These are great in that regard.		But it boils down to what matters - the electrical connections and how firmly do they hold onto the components' legs.		So many (I mean many) false contacts, bad contacts, flakey contacts.  I am finally resorting to just creating my own home-made "solderless jumper board"		And I researched these a lot...  I hesitated spending even more money ...  and today not sure that would even matter.
1,I bought a large bag of these a few years ago to attach to my rain barrels. As of this spring, every single one of them is BROKEN. This is simply because plastic bulkhead fittings, when yanked on via the hose in any way, will break.		So now I've switched to brass bulkhead fittings exclusively. The brass fittings can even be used in barrels that once had plastic bulkheads that broke and started leaking. The brass fittings are simply much, much tougher.		I suppose that if you never plan to move your rain barrels, these are fine. But any tugging on those hoses, in my experiences, can bust these plastic bulkhead fittings. So they're simply no cut out for the task of tapping a rain barrel.
1,Junk, do not waste your money
1,Was DOA. These things happen. I wasn't in the mood to troubleshoot a brand new device I purchased for mostly troubleshooting other devices / cabling issues, so returning for a replacement.		Will hopefully update with more stars a proper review.
1,Only switches AC voltage. Wish that was clarified in the title of product instead of the jumbled mess they call a description.
1,Not very adhesive. This tape will handle high temperatures, but don't expect it to stay in place for long.
1,horrible. Support WILL NOT answer your questions even if your bot is completly broken.
1,cheap ass plastic...did not last under low use
1,Bags arrived stuffed into a package that was too small so they were all wrinkled and damaged.  Very disappointed.
1,Search "Primefit air regulator" and you'll see something that looks more substantial, and costs a bit less.
1,Sparkles, I can't say I expected this stuff to be a little bit translucent and shimmer, but as always SainSmart delivers of filament that is amazing to work with		Ya this is an update got my third roll and noticed the diameter is all over the place with this batch, it is very disappointing I love this stuff (not so much the color as what you can do with it.)
1,This microwave was pretty much as described.  It worked right out of the box, and it warms and heats thing much better than my previous microwave, which was of the same power rating.  For the same rating, this microwave probably heats 30% faster.	Unfortunately, this microwave comes with a few annoying features.  The hardware tolerances are a bit too coarse, and the door fit, and the body molding, tend to be mismatched in different places.  The door latch makes a huge sound when opening and closing, and if the microwave is not bolted to the counter (mine is not) opening and closing the door always moves the microwave. The fan and the motor are very noisy. By contrast the finished beep is very low and timid, to the point that sometimes I do not hear the beep. I know that it has finished when the noise stops, particularly since the finished beep does not repeat, as most other microwaves do.	On balance, it you can ignore the running noise, this is a good microwave for the price range. If I can not learn to ignore the negatives of this microwave within the next two weeks, it is going back.		Update - after 21 months of medium use, this oven stopped working.  Very disappointing.  I am changing the original rating of 4 to 1
1,These are cheaply made terminals that do not crimp well, even with a quality Greenlee ratcheting terminal crimper.
1,Maybe this would work if you're carrying around a long, tall cardboard box filled with styrofoam, but we were carrying something 2.5'x3'x2.5' weighing only 100 lbs., and the idea of using our elbows was a joke. It was totally awkward, the item was precariously balanced, and so we couldn't use these ridiculous straps.
1,I do not like this toothbrush in any way. It is cheaply designed, with an uncomfortable grip, sparse bristles that do not clean, and a joke of a gimmick with its useless, rubber polishing flaps.		This toothbrush only provides an awkward, unsatisfactory brushing experience that leave teeth yearning for a different brush. I cannot stand this toothbrush.
1,I regret buying this! The only thing it's good for is a mean practical joke. I got this to extend the life of my TENS unit pads. I grudgingly give the product one star because it did stick to my skin and it did conduct the current. But......I am heartily sorry I used it. It ruined a large pad I use on my lower back. I just wanted to increase the adhesion. This stuff stays permanently gummy and the patch slides on the skin, leaving goo behind. When you touch it, strings pull up and spread the mess. It cannot simply be wiped off with a dry paper towel. When you wet it, it takes on the consistency of slug slime. It must be scrubbed with hot soapy water over and over. Then, you get white, water-logged boogers. Plus, you still have a sticky residue left behind. I gave up because my skin was sore. It also seemed to conduct the current irregularly. In some parts of the pad, the current felt like a sharp pinprick!
1,Bad its real bad lol
1,I ordered the 1/4 by mistake, wanted the 1/2.
1,Wrap would not stick together.  I followed the instructions, wrapped the product around a pipe, but the wrap did not adhere to the pipe or to itself.		Im a bit suspicious that some moisture may have seeped into the packaging while it was stored on the shelf prior to shipment.  The wrap was extremely hard to unroll.		When I applied water the wrap was hard and did not feel tacky.		Anyway, the product didn't work.
1,Easily crushed and split especially when cold. I was kidding myself that an 18" flexible cone would stop city slickers from parking on my lot. The only way these cones would deter illegal parking would be to fire them out of a bazooka at the jerks.
