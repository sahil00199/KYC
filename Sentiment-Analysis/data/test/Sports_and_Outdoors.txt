0,Excellent product.  Would recommend.  Fast shipping
0,Works great on my new rock island armory .45acp. Feels good gripping it and it is indestructible.
0,Works as advertised, Installs on to K-valve in 30 seconds.	The gauge on it does not read accurately; when filling my HW100 the rifle's gauge reads 200bar, and the gauge on the yoke reads somewhere between the 2-3 9 (2500psi)  mark.	Also, the internal regulator set at (3000psi) does not work properly, i ended up over filling my HW100 to 3200psi. i bought this particular yoke to prevent overfilling, since its supposedly regulated for 3000psi, so it kinda failed in that aspect.		The build quality is great it made from 1 single piece of aluminum.	The knurling on both screws is done neatly, and work great and it remain in place once tightened.	the quick connect/disconnect works great.		make sure to get a 1/8Male BSPP connector to attach from the yoke to the fill line.		despite the few quirks....i may purchase again on the future.
0,I'm 5'1 135lb with a compact athletic body type.  This suit fits perfectly and is surprisingly flattering.  I'll be buying at least two more.
0,TLDR: This bag is pretty great for a budget sleeping bag, it is not as warm as the ratings show for hammock camping, but may be perfectly comfortable at the rating in a tent. Do not kid yourself: if the weather looks like it will dip into 45-50 degrees do not assume this will be enough for a comfortable night's sleep if you sleep cold.. but for spring/summer camping this guy's price and size is pretty great.		I put a lot of research into a budget sleeping bag, and I was convinced this bag was it for me. I was going hammock camping, and that will flavor this review as I feel like it will hold up better and be warmer for tent camping vs the colder-running hammocks.		How warm is it? Fairly.. but I would not trust that 45 degrees to be a hard and fast rule for this guy. For beginners, those warmth ratings are for the LOWER end  of things. You want the warmth rating to be markedly lower than the temperatures you'll be facing. For example, although we expected mostly 55 degrees, the temperature did dip into the 45 range.. and you could tell. With an REI thermo-reactor liner, thermals, and this thing, I was still quite cold upon waking up in the early morning. The REI liner pretty reliably adds 5+ degrees of comfort, and my thermals are really top-notch quality as well, so I really expected those to add to the already lower end ratings.. But hammock camping tends to run colder in the first place, and while I had a sleeping mat, I did not use an underquilt because of the space it would take up while backpacking. I was significantly warmer with all of this gear versus my boyfriend's simple jungle snug-pak sleeping bag though. I suspect that right now's weather here at home (60 degrees in the evenings, 80s-90s in the daytime) is where this sleeping bag shines, and it would be sufficient by itself. I also have already purchased a kickstarter for a great brand called Ravean with a heated sleeping bag liner currently in the works as a pre-order, and I think that this guy + that will be a pretty good combo for camping in the 45-50 degree range. I do not plan on camping in anything lower than that though. I have the jackets from Ravean and they were really great quality, so I suspect the liner to be up to the same standards.		How does it look and feel? As the picture shows. The yellow is.. VERY yellow. Slightly pastel highlighter yellow, with a blue exterior. It doesn't look too bad in terms of camping. I definitely like the look of the snug-pak more with its subdued military vibe, being ex-military myself, but the yellow is on the inside and so it does well. There is a great youtube review up about this thing that shows off some of the external features, but mainly the zippers are high quality, the mummy-top-part did not get in the way if you did not want to use it as one, there was space enough to roll around in it for me (5'3" female, 135 lbs), the feet did not feel cramped or too spacey/airy that they felt colder than the rest of my body, and there is a hook-and-pile zipper cover if you desire. I never used it, but I was really glad they included a small pile that keeps it out of the way for those that decline. The zipper area did not feel especially drafty either. The material is fairly silky, and slippery, but it was comfortable all the same. I also washed this guy as soon as I got it to ensure it held up to machine washing and it did very well, let it air dry outside for a whole day and then threw it in the dryer for a while to take out any leftover moisture. I feel pretty confident that if I sweat in this guy it will not ruin it.		I went backpacking and while this guy is very compact for its warmth and size when opened, it still takes up a decent amount of space. If you have a 65-70L bag you'll be fine with everything you'll ever desire for hammock camping + space for an underquilt too. If you're like me and you have a 52L bag, it is actually easier and takes up less space to just stuff this guy in as he is without the included stuff sack.. but I do like the stuff sack included with it, and it will zip down fairly compact with it. The stuff sack is pretty handsome as well.		This bag is lightweight, feels great, is fairly portable, and fairly comfortable. If you're looking for budget camping but want something that will be a step up from the old giant entire-torso-sized heavy coleman-style bags of yesteryear, this guy is definitely right up your alley. If you want something that will withstand 3 seasons and you sleep VERY warm naturally, this guy will probably do the trick. If you're a small, petite lady looking for an early spring bag I would say this is probably not going to keep you comfortable by itself.. but it is still a great bag in it's own right, and I probably would purchase it again. I would say if you're only summer camping, go with the lighter-weight model of this, or a snug-pak because those are really light weight small bags.. but this will do well in 60-70 degrees for cold sleepers and 50 degrees for warm sleepers.
0,Very high quality.
0,Always a great product.
0,great product, sturdy, adjusts to several pistols in my collection.
0,Love it
0,This is a box that is water tight, and has enough space to keep all your black powders supplies in one convenient location.  I keep my propellants, bullets, primers, extra nipples, and tools in this one handy location, so when it's time for black powder season, I won't have to waste time looking, and I can just take off to the woods.
0,Nice fit and size
0,I've been using only one attached to my fishing vest, for the forceps.	- very well balanced spring tension	- it looks really good on the vest	- smooth and efficient	No cons so far.	Hope this helps :)
0,Works good. I have a touring bike and i'm not sure why but unless you're buying a cheap bike, bikes seem not to come with kick stands anymore. I like to be able to stop at random places and not have to throw my bike on the floor, I didn't want to spend much as I had spent enough on the bike already (I'm using this on a Windsor Tourist), and it works really well. I don't hit it while riding and it holds my bike up. With my bike it had to be places pretty far back.
0,This  Gamo assorted  pack of .177 pellets  were well worth the price and they flew through my Winchester Air Rifle and I was able to bring down large Rats, squirrels and large ducks.
0,Best hot tea mug I have ever owned.
0,works fine.  easy to attach.  the items can fall out when I unzip the cover. otherwise totally satisfied.  lots of room
0,Love it
0,Bag is awesome, lots of storage,,so far its sturdy
0,My son got the 15 lb draw for Christmas.  He likes it .  The two arrows that come with it are squared on the end and one tip pulled off when we extracted it from the target. The arrows are poor quality.  Best to get extra arrows also sold on Amazon (the field tips are not squared off).
0,A few months back I decided to buy a Coleman stove. I've always been a fan of Coleman products. So of course I have to buy some accessories to go with it lol. I received it today and it seems to be a nice addition to our stove. It looks like it's made well. It unfolds and packs up fast. Can't wait to use it. We have a camping trip planned for next weekend.  I will use it and if I have any problems with it I will edit this review
0,Bought this on a Lightning Deal for just under $20.  I have been looking for a knife that I could carry around for daily use.  My criteria were that it had to be easy to open in an emergency, have a sharp blade that would hold an edge and be big enough to be useful, but not so big as to weigh down my jeans or be uncomfortable.  This knife fits the bill.  I've been please with it.  I've heard others say it wasn't big enough for them, but it is just right for me.  Fits my hand well.  Maybe because I'm a woman.  Maybe I just have different uses for it.  Being able to open the blade one-handed has been very convenient.
0,I love it
0,Purchased this to fit inside a titan kettle, the height is less than the 500ml cup. It fits nicely. Although the volume of the cup is less than the other, it will still hold 12.6 floz . Plenty of room for the morning dose of coffee on the trail. Suits my needs and reasons for purchasing it.
0,Works Great!! Water tastes CLEAN and pure. No issues.
0,I am not fond of Chinese manufactured goods but sometimes one doesn't have a choice. I searched for some marino base layers that were made in the USA but to no avail. In fact all the marino wool base layers I found were made in china. Oh well.
0,Satisfactory, Thanks!
0,I got this light for my sons birthday, and was so impressed with how bright it is, that I bought one for myself.	The light looks and feels very well built. We love riding at night and this light will let us do it safely.	My son commented that because the light is so bright we should use the light in the strobe setting for daytime riding.
0,great...
0,good quality and promp shipping
0,Update: Just bought a pack of 40. Great value at $18 for the whole lot in frustration free packaging (which inclues the original box packaged inside another generic cardboard box). Probably the best value you'll find around next to Walmart's $7 for 15. Happy shooting!		These cartridges are great and incredibly reliable. I haven't had any trouble with it in my Crosman 1088. Can go for a good 5-6 magazines. A friend of mine has had trouble with these during our trips to the range, where the cartridges would not secure itself to the puncturing nub in the handle of the gun. The CO2 would leak and completely ice over the handle. But I believe that's a product malfunction on his side. I've never had the issue.
0,Best glasses: I have been shopping for years for sunglasses and often replacing them. I have tried $10 glasses at street fairs and over $200 glasses. The sunclouds tried in tandem with the $200 glasses are very fine nad you can shop on line for around $50!	1: very comfortable sailing, biking, just walking around.	2: withstand dropping and reasonable rough use.	3: let in a lot of light, useful in older age, so they are ok when you go indoors	4: look cool, just as much as very expensive glasses	5: color rendition is excellent	So....no reason to look further
0,Love this rod. (Shakespear Model # BWS110070) Mated the rod to the Okuma Avenger ABF-40 Bait Feeder salt water spinning reel. Makes a great combo at the beach. I also have the Shakespeare Two-Piece Ugly Stik Bigwater 8-foot spinning rod, (Shakespeare Model # BWS110080) which is mated to the Okuma Avenger ABF-50 Bait Feeder spinning reel. As always, it's hard to beat the action of an Ugly Stix.
0,These are my favorite workout leggings. I have to buy a size up on leggings so they are not thin and see through around my thighs or when I squat but usually the waist is really loose and gaps. These legging have tie on the inside to tighten the waist. The color looks good and didn't fade after multiple washes.
0,Great Shaker bottle!  Been using it for many weeks and it performs exactly as I need it too.  Very durable, very portable, easy to clean.  Nice product to have for those on the go.	I received a free sample of this product in exchange for honest feedback.  Please ask me questions if you need help deciding if this is the right product for you.
0,great product! recommended. good quality and design.
0,Bought this out of curiosity. When it arrived, I was impressed with the feel of it. It has some weight to it and it feels very solid. Every part is very solid, nothing was loose. The blade was fairly sharp, but a sharpener is needed to really hone the edge. The sheath appears to be lined with a thin layer of plastic to keep the blade from penetrating through it...nice!! Not sure what I'll ever use it for, but a nice addition to a collection for amateur knife enthusiast. Happy I purchased it!
0,Love this! I used to own one when I was younger now just want another one that has more tools!  The quality seems ok.  This thing is quite wide so be prepare for that (also I'm still looking for a nice carrying case for it so I can stow it in the car).  Great all-in-one knife for the money.
0,works great keeps my clothes clean and my wife from killing me. I ride on the beach and in the mud my back stays dry
0,Feel safer with this when I walk out of work at nighttime.
0,Works great.
0,Now Thats a KNIFE!  I Love it !
0,This is precision
0,I have enjoyed every aspect of this hammock. I am only 5'2" so I have plenty of room. My partner is just over 6'2" though and he also seems to be comfortable in it. I have had hammocks before so I already knew the knots to use, but if you don't know any you should really google it before you go to set it up the first time as there are no directions included.
0,Bought two stands...one for my mountain bike and one for the wife's.  They are great and hold the bike very sturdy compared to other stands.  I use the stands in my garage.	When transporting I use them in the back of my pickup to secure the bikes upright and then use a single tie down.  Works well!
0,received well on time. very nice
0,This is a great party marshmallow roasting set from FireForks.  I like that this is a larger set than what is normally offered with 8 roasting sticks.  Each one has a plastic cap on the handle with a different color so everyone knows which stick is theirs.		MEASUREMENTS	Fully extended- 32	Compacted length- 12 	Handle (including the colored cap)- 4 	Handle diameter- 9/16	Prong length- 3 	Distance between the two prongs- 		They have a very long reach at 32.  When the sticks are fully extended, they have a little bit of flex but you would expect that with as long as these roasting sticks are.  They are strong enough to handle hot dogs without bouncing up and down.  The shorter you make the sticks, the firmer the stick becomes.  The handles are wood.  The roasting stick ends are blunt, rather than pointed, so they don't have rubber tips to cover the prongs.  It also comes with a canvas storage pouch with a zipper and a bonus set of bamboo skewers.  I gave 5 stars because of the easy storage, the way it compacts down, the storage bag, the long extension and the colored markers on each one.		 I value credible,  informative, and candid Amazon reviews by other Amazon buyers and hope this review helps you. Im willing to write a little more than the average user because of getting this at a discount.  Although I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I don't spend all this time and energy to post non-truthful reviews.  My integrity is worth more than saving a couple of bucks.  Please click HELPFUL  if you appreciate the effort.
0,This is a big heavy and long bat. I recommend swinging it outside. If you do use it inside for home protection, I recommend you use it to jab at your intruder. Then when he is down take a swing. Jabs are much faster. Swings are very slow.
0,this product is excelent is complete and too good, and the shipping was excelent all the description is right, very clear and the quality is perfect
0,I wanted to love the item but when I opened the box I couldn't see anything in it?  I felt a fabric material, pulled it out of the box and realized it was the camouflaged bag.  Obvious joke.  Nice, well-made bag, zippers seem sturdy and the bags are a little stiff.  I'll assume they'll loosen up in a short while and the stiffness is probably from the waterproofing.  Lots of pockets and places for accessories.
0,I purchased this to stop the noise and rumblings of my washing machine which I run almost 24/7 so at night it has to be quiet while everyone in the house sleeps but momma who is busy washing and drying clothes. This works perfectly. Keeps the noise down to a minimum and no more bumping.  All's well (;
0,Using this bag over at the Memorial in Scottsdale Arizona.  Great for someone that doesn't throw 30 discs and not for tournament play.  This thing is AWESOME for a driver or two a buzzz and a putter a light round where you're looping in 45 to 90 minutes.		I am very satisfied with this product.	Received for free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have regarding the product, whether it be positive or negative. My review is solely based on my experience an honest opinions. Please like my review if it helped you and hope the product works as well for you as it did for me!
0,One of the best cameras we have owned. Great photos and easy on the batteries. Bought another one for our son.
0,Great value for the money.	Gnats hate it.	We love it.
0,Could have a better description, put schematic in pictures I ordered the wrong one the first time but seller switched out no problems. Very good product
0,Excellent headlamp. Just broke this in on a 28 mile trek in Southern California and it worked flawlessly. It ran for many hours, and is still going strong. I cant attest whether it actually runs 80, but it certainly has a great battery life.
0,These are soooo cute and comfy! The color is pretty and they look adorable with wedges. I wore them to a belly dancing event recently and received lots of compliments. I'm so happy I got them. And now my friend bought some too.
0,These are great baseball pants.  reinforced in the right places.
0,My 8U girl just started using this bat after we broke it in and I can definitely see the pop as well as a more smooth swing with the balanced weight.  I would say that she's getting 10 to 15 feet more distance with this bat than her previous alloy bat.  She definitely loves the bat and swings with more confidence.  She is 4'6" and 64 pounds.  We ordered the 30 inch 18 ounce bat and it's a little heavy for her but she's working through it
0,Great
0,These sights are Amazing and functional. They allow my to switch from my red dot to iron sights in twist of the wrist. They look and fit great
0,Nice chair
0,My son likes it. Its easy to travel with and he likes the style of it...whatever that means. Anything that makes him happy ...and fits in my budget....is a good buy.
0,This is the best phone holder, I enjoyed the way it fix my phone and easy to get out and ruggedly build.
0,Only two downsides to this knife:	1.) Very smooth sides make traction a little light.	2.) Really, really, REALLY wish it didn't say "Taiwan" on the blade - When handling this knife, one would think it should cost a little more... then you see "Taiwan" and remember why it isn't a $100 knife.
0,Fits perfect. Neck is high like I like it. Washes well and then hang to dry. Color does not fade.
0,Nice quality snaps
0,bought as an adventure pack for my niece. fit all of her kit in there and still had room left. a little big for her (She's four) but it gives some room to grow into.
0,Extremely bright flash light. This was a nice add to our piece. I really like that you have the option of a pressure switch or regular switch. Unfortunately it did not come with any tape to attach the pressure switch. I have had a few pressure switches and this one is of better quality than most. Overall I was very thrilled with the light and mount. I was disappointed that the screws for the mount were not long enough for my shotgun barrel but were to almost long for my .556 barrel when using the barrel clamp screws. The good thing is that the mount is two pieces. You can use it one of twos way, first you can use it with any Picatinny rail or you can take it apart and it will easily attach to a barrel without Picatinny rail using the barrel clamp.	Overall I very happy with the quality of this entire package and would definitely purchase again. I wish it had come with a battery but other than that I have nothing but positive things to say about this setup. I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. In no way did amazon or the seller influence my review my review reflects my personal opinion and experience with the product.
0,Great all purpose ar-15 nylon brush kit. I prefer nylon because it is the least abrasive material to clean your guns with which will prevent wear over time.
0,I needed something to cover my mostly bald head when I swim, snorkel and scuba. This fits very well, great quality and a name brand.
0,not much to say, water tastes like water in these, I abuse them and water still tastes well
0,It fits. It is licensed. What more can you ask for? Would buy again. Price was far cheaper than on the store.
0,Durable and works well.
0,I've used plain plastic water bottles for a while now, and decided to give this insulated one a try. With plain plastic, a bottle filled with ice then filled with water allows all of the ice to melt in less than one hour, even when it's in the fifties. After two hours (55-68) this bottle still had about 25% of its ice left. Very happy with that!		The reason I chose Camelbak was the valve. I've used their packs for years and trusted them to get it right. They did. The valve opens automatically when you squeeze or suck on the bottle, lets air in after and reseals automatically. No more pulling on a valve with your teeth and bumping it on your chest to close it. Also has a manual off valve, making sure you don't accidentally squirt water everywhere on the way to the trail.
0,Durable.  Work great.  Although I haven't submerged it yet!
0,I really enjoy the Elf.
0,Great Ball!!!
0,Use for indoor range pistol shooting. Larger calibers noise will be echoed and amplified slightly at times. Quick fix is to turn volume down low. Comfortable to wear for extended time. Have yet to try outdoors... Happy with the purchase overall
0,I love this light. Its bright, reliable, and durable. It takes some practice to get it to strobe constantly, using only one hand; but I prefer the ergonomics/controls much more than Surefire lights.
0,Durable arrows that have a bit of heft to them.  I had one glance off the top of a soft target and hit a cinderblock fence; it took a chunk out of it , and didn't crack the shaft or blemish the chrome finish on the tip. These might last me a while.
0,It works.  I can attest to that.  Seems pretty basic, but well made.
0,good
0,Fast shipping, item as described.  Good job.
0,excellent!
0,This box was way bigger than my husband and I expected. It has lots of little compartment areas in the drawers to organize all your doo-dads. It is very durable and handsome.
0,The pull-up is one of the single best exercises you can do to build strength, improve posture, and reach fitness goals. But they tend to be an "all or nothing" drill: either you can pull your chin up to the bar, or you can't. I like this RAGE fitness band because it allows me to approach pull-ups in a variety of ways.		For me, I can only do a few pull-ups unassisted. I use this band to increase the volume of pull-ups I can do in order to push my arms and especially my back to exhaustion.		I like the quick-release clasp as well for people who would like to add multiple bands.  You could even do progressive sets this way (do a set with two bands, a set with one band, a set with no band) with very little down time/set up time between sets.		Overall, I like this product for adding pull-ups and for adding VARIETY to my pull-ups.
0,A lot sturdier than expected.  My boys go fishing with their PopPop, so when I got them fishing rods and the tackle box.  It's very roomy and love that you have trays and a bottom compartment to place larger objects.  My boys can tend to be rough on things but this seems that it will hold up.  Great price too!
0,Good product, delivery on times, I like it !
0,My dog is about 15 lbs. Looks like the dog in the picture. This mounts up great and is very secure. My dog is about 12" tall, 15" long and she can lay down comfortably if she wanted to. I would suggest a couple good pieces of Velcro for the bottom mount to make sure it doesn't move.
0,fit well
0,Just what I wanted
0,For some reason my son thinks he's an evening Indiana Jones and likes to walk about the backyard looking for I don't know what...I bought this light for him . He enjoys it a lot . Easy to fit on his head. Very bright and at a good price .
0,used this at disney this year and it saved me lol. It was a lot smaller portion than i imagined though
0,Got it for my husband but we both use it.  I like that we could start out on an easy setting and work our way up to the peddling being harder.
0,Seems to be exactly what I expected as advertised. I'd buy this again.
0,My favorite reloading trays by a mile
0,I have another pair exactly like these. I love them. I have a total of 7 other pairs of socks from Thorlo. These have the thickest pads for running.
0,Fit was as expected, nice top, will buy another.
0,One didn't have a nut, but that was fixable.	Put some Lock Tight and then it worked just fine.
0,Perfect fit for my "Outdoor Products" brand poles from Walmart. They are threaded. They are a little smaller than the original, but they should work great!
0,Fits pretty good, looks great. Awesome quality.
0,I love how it keeps track of my sleep and activity during the day.  I try every day to reach 100% or 10,000 steps.  It also buzzes my wrist if I've been inactive for over an hour.
0,Just what you would expect from under armour. Good product. These are the thinner style but I like that the leg is just a bit longer than the shorties. These can actually be worn just as shorts where the shorties I only have my daughter wear under dresses.
0,Saved the day for my Daughter at swim camp this year. Fit well, stayed in place, and no more swimmers ear.
0,Sleeve fit perfectly, and colors were bright but ripped after 3 games. Was expecting it to last a little longer.
0,The magnets on these clips are outstanding. They are very strong so there is no chance of the marker slipping off.
0,Thats awesome
0,Perfect size..finally
0,Bought these and gave them to a friend. They are good HEAVY duty snares. Friend loves them.
0,Have these in both 177 and 22. Work well, quality is good and accuracy is pretty good as well. Maybe not the best for your gun specifically, but for the price, i will run these all the time. Energy transfer is pretty solid from shooting into a clay block. Havent huntes with them yet, but i think they will do just fine
0,The headlight is a pretty standard thumb acre mounting bracket that holds an led flashlight. Has some adjustment in the mounting bracket and is easy to install. Light is fine, though I will not be surprised if it fails within a year.  For the price on two, I am very happy. These meet what I was looking for - lights for my kids bikes that they use riding around campgrounds. I am not looking for excellent lighting, just basic visibility.  As for the tail light...I love it!  It seems silly, but this design is perfect for kids bikes!  It is like a stretchy silicon band that incases a little box containing and led and battery. It is a simple hook in the back.  Installs in 3 seconds!  Doesn't vibrate around and mess up like many others I have owned. Even came with extra batteries!!!  This is a great light set for basic kids bikes to be used in situations in which visibility of the bike by drivers is the main focus. Highly recommended as a great value
0,This tent is awesome!! And its huge!! I love the thing, and it only takes me about 15 mins to completely setup. Very waterproof (tested...lol) and windproof. I would recommend this tent to anyone. No need for a tarp underneath the tent due to the built in tarp. Surprisingly I had no problems getting it up and back into the carry case. I've used it 4 times already and would definitely buy one again!
0,good price. works well
0,love em
0,Good stuff. Pen is metal & tough. Cap is tight so if aligned to the spray tip, you always have it pointed in the right direction when you pull off the cap.
0,Taken a beating....I believe it's the best out there.
0,Admittedly, i'm no expert when it comes to swim goggles. But I'm doing my first sprint Tri and needed something. These goggles are comfortable, they seal extremely well, and resist fogging up pretty well.	The biggest advantage of these, in my opinion, is comfort. They don't have to be on super tight to seal well. The tint is light so visibility is good and they definitely cut out the glare.	Getting them back into the case is a bit challenging with the strap wanting to go all over the place.		Overall, I'm very pleased and would recommend these as a very good option. I don't mean just for the price, or for a novice, these seem like excellent goggles.
0,I used this with my crossbow In my blind this spring. This rest allowed my wife and I to shoot multiple turkeys. This rest allows precision shooting with my Excalibur 380 crossbow. Easy to manipulate and quite. Very well constructed and light weight so it can be carried to the blind every day. Great product highly recommend it.
0,Works good. Haven't had anything but hawks and owls attack it but in due time coyotes will come to it
0,Nice and bright. Easy to install. Rugged little bugger. Love the way this fits my CZ75.
0,Great price for great gloves, nice and lightweight good for summer time riding.  They are low rise ending right at the wrist, they are thin palmed (no padding), and have great grip.
0,Fits nicely under my helmet and keeps my head warm. Slits for sunglasses are a great feature.
0,I bought three tandem kayaks for our family. We used them in the mangroves of Southwest Florida as well as in the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. They are absolutely great, fast and good tracking, plenty of room and easy to inflate. I have used a foot pump and also a battery powered high pressure pump since I have to pump up all 3 at the same time, Plenty of storage and durable! A little bit heavy if in the bag but easy when inflated.
0,I drink a lot of water and I have been looking for a large cold water container. I saw these at target but they are more expensive and smaller. I found this two pack and was surprised that they were 40 oz. I have used them for about 2 weeks. I can put ice in them and fill them up at least 3 times and still have bout half the ice at the end of the day (depending on how warm the water is). I highly recommend them for any one that drinks a lot of water, juice or Gatorade. They are not good for carbonated drinks since it will create pressure and explode on you when you open it. Now if you leave it open and drink your carbonated drink you would not have that issue. I also like that it has the handle to carry. It gets heavy and it is large to carry without the handle.
0,I got a bit different color version which is matching my red TG 1400 and I would not want to miss this this ab crunch accessory. Really perfect and easy to use. Well made and sturdy.
0,Love this! Worked great!
0,Got from amazon wearhouse as second run/defects. Havent had any issues, great tape, great value!
0,Decent foot pump. Seems durable. I liked that it collapses to be fairly compact. I took this on a flight to Maui to camp, and it fit easily in my backpack carry-on. It's like the size of textbook- without the weight. For the price it was worth it. However it was annoying to use- the hose line kept popping out during use, so air would rush out of the camping pad being pumped up in the meantime. We remedied it by having a partner hold the hose on while the other person pumped, or we had to bend over and use one hand to hold the hose line in place and pump with our hands. It seemed like the hose should screw on- it had the appropriate grooves on the hose but no grooves to screw into on the actual pump. Other than the hose popping out during use, the pump was compact, and did the job. It was worth it for the money.
0,Great price for a great tool. Handle is full steel from tip to tip. I've pulled two cassettes with this, and couldn't imagine any reason to spend 3x the price, even in a shop environment. Worst repair this might need is a new chain after a couple-hundred cassettes, of which there's plenty around my home.
0,WE LOVE THIS THIS PENNANT!	GO DUCKS!!
0,It has multiple option to choose your light. Also, very bright and it has wide angle to beam through the street/road. Good for night time uses
0,This is one of the most useful designs Buck ever made.  The shape of the blade is perfect for field dressing, boning, and skinning.  The blade holds an edge all through the skinning process, which typically requires the knife to be resharpened several times.  The balance is darn near perfect and the knife is a work of art....a real beauty to behold.  Not only that, but this is an awesome price.....the knife retails for $120.  You won't be sorry if you buy this knife.
0,I got this sight super cheap but it works great on my PDW. I'm not taking on terrorists on a regular basis so I didn't think I needed to spend $700. Seems to work fine.
0,Works well. Caught Fish.
0,I got this for my wife for running in the winter...but whe also will use it in her grappling class...she loves it
0,Quality line
0,No secondary rings to easily adjust for a 2's court but it works with added sand plates not the stakes it comes with.
0,Offers lots of cushioning and padding for an open face head guard; but my sparring partner hit me with a overhand, right on the nose, so I'll be wearing a full face protector for now on.  By the way, I have a gigantic nose, so that's half the problem.  Also, order a size larger, it does run small.  I had to reorder to an XL and that was still fairly tight.
0,The gliders work very well on carpet if you purchase the carpet gliders.  What you need to do is practice using them with a gliding video. I think it will take a few repeats to use them to their full extent but the work out is amazing.  I did a low impact DVD and usually I like high impact, intense but the workout was difficult.  It uses your muscles in a different manner.
0,Perfect fit and finish, color looks better in person, great price for G10 grips, and definitely on par with VZ.
0,The loops on this Stretch Strap are handy but I'm not crazy about its being stretchy.  I prefer an older green strap that I can't find; it had loops and the strap remained firm rather than stretching.  Oh well, I still have an older long blue strap without loops that can help me stretch  at the end of a workout.
0,These lifting straps are like having a glove and strap in one. I used to use gloves but would still end up with callouses because they didn't have enough palm protection so I got some straps for most pull exercises like deadlifts but still had grip issues. These lifting grips have been great for push and pull exercises and are much better than the gloves and straps I had tried before plus they also have good wrist support. The palm protector works really well and is padded enough to protect my palms from getting callouses while at the same time allowing me to securely grip the bar. The only thing is that it does partially dye my palms black (slightly, not very noticeable) but it does wash off.  Overall I really like these grips. It really helped my deadlifts, shrugs, rows, etc
0,They are as described but I am not impressed with the finish at the handle end. There are a lot of wood fuzzies on it. They function fine.
0,perfect materials perfect size , perfect look but yes it is expensive
0,Not much to say on this one. Strap works great. I like that it came with the swivels on it already. I am looking to order another. I would recommend. I have it on my Ruger 10/22 with ATI Stock.
0,This was affordable, works great for camping or the zombie apocalypse, and is nice and light for easy packing/carrying.  We use it often and we are glad we bought it.  It's also cheap enough that we don't care that it's turning black (yes, you can make the effort to prevent that with soapy water but it's kind of nerdy to want your outdoor gear to look shiny and new forever) and that our kids have dropped and dented it while "helping out" around the campsite.  It still makes coffee, so it's the best camping accessory we own.
0,Pretty much the knife my Dad borrowed from an older friend to take to Viet Nam in 1965 (as a gunship pilot). Not as big as he remembered, but every bit of the "big Buck knife" you hear about. I am pleased to see the quality of current production knives, I have a hunting knife from the mid-80's to compare to, slimmer and more dressing oriented. They are equivalent, despite 30 years of possible "cheaping out" on the quality. I have a spendy Randall Bowie, I don't see any functional difference at ALL between the two knives. I'm glad to have gifted my Dad the knife his friend (who didn't expect him to make it back) wouldn't sell him when he did get back.
0,good
0,Works as advertised. I needed a backup to keep at my 2nd residence so I wouldn't have to always remember to pack it.
0,This basic boiler coffee pot gets the job done. The lid on this boiler is attached, so you don't drop it in the fire and make the other cowboys mad. The GSI brand pots are a little thin and easy to dent, and the lids are not always a perfect fit. Old pots are much thicker. But for the price this one will do the job.	You can also use the other more sturdy brands percolator pots and take out the basket and tube.	Boiled coffe is a learned procedure and takes practice. If you cannot face having a bit of grounds in your coffee, or a dented pot with black soot marks on it, this may not be for you. This pot is not really for the stove. A boiled coffee pot like this one is meant for the campfire, or the fire-pit at home if you have one.		CARE OF POT: If you want it to stay nice and clean looking, wet the outside with a bit of soap before you put it on the fire, and let it dry to an invisible shield. Soot wipes right off when you wash it. Unless this stays outside all the time, this is a really smart idea to save the nice color on your pot. There is no basket, filter, tube, or other clutter to worry about, I want as little fussiness as possible for campfire coffee.		RECIPE FOR BOILED COFFEE: Here is a recipe from the book I am writing: Use 3/4 cup of coffee grounds per quart of coffee, or one coffee measure scoop per coffee cup of water. Heat the amount of water you intend to use in your pan over a hot fire, until boiling. Then add the coffee grounds, and an eggshell. Yes I said an eggshell. Get the water back to boiling as it slows for a couple of minutes after dropping in the coffee. Pull the pot off the fire and set it aside for a few minutes. Pour in a 1/2 cup of cold water. Along with the eggshells, this helps the grounds sink to the bottom of your pot. Some people do not like the cold water trick as they want the coffee as hot as possible. If that is you, just set it aside about 5 minutes to settle. Now the next secret to this is.... Don't pour it out! Instead use a scooper or a ladle to serve your coffee so that you do not stir up the grounds again. If you do not have a ladle, pour really really slow. That is why the lid on a boiler is supposed to be bigger than a lid on a percolator.		TIP: Remember not to drink the cup to the bottom, throw out the last bit has grounds, then get a fresh cup. Now when I was a kid there were tricks that my uncles used when hunting involving socks as bag for grounds, but don't even ask me to go there. This type of pot is also convenient for leaving on the fire during the day to keep hot water going for washing dishes, bathing, cooking, or to make some hot chocolate or tea in the cup.		Now keep in mind that this page lists about 6 or more different size posts, some are percolators, so make sure you get what you really need. Boilers tend to come in bigger sizes that percolators, so if you need a BIG pot, you can get a boiler all the way up to 36 cups. Now that looks impressive on a fire. I hope all this helps you, Happy Trails!
0,Amazing knife for everyday carry. It's a nice conversation starter and very sharp right out of box. It's just under 4 inches so it's perfectly legal to carry in California. The g10 scales give it good grip and the back lock is very secure. I love this knife from crkt.
0,Best light for the money in the market.  Lights up street signs half a mile away at night.  Can be seen in bright daylight for 1/4 mile.
0,My brother loves this fitted cap
0,Product as described. does the jProduct as described.
0,go pats
0,Target's met my expectations and worked perfectly for indoor range, and definitely meet the NRA and DOA requirements. Good quality and visual print.
0,love em but does not take long and they start to wear down a little
0,This water filter is amazing! I took it directly out of the box and to the swamp in the backyard - filtered and drank Louisiana swamp water which I won't even swim in. I have done this several times over the past week with no ill effects and it even tastes good, like better than some brands of bottled water kinda good.
0,I took my wood panels off my 1911 and put this grip on and am very pleased with it, it is a little deeper then my stock grip but this is softer and more of a comfortable grip now and the price was great.
0,Worked great for my ar 15 and ar 10 builds.
0,OK, I love these lights!  I have monkeylectric lights, and those, of course, are sort of the top-of-the-line wheel lights. Let's face it, they are expensive, but they are a breeze to install and they work great. BUT, so do these! I think I paid about $8 a wheel (so under $20 with shipping) and it took me about, 10-20 minutes to get these on my spokes. I have a small beach cruiser (see picture) and the lights were a little longer than the tire - meaning at one point I actually went all the way around the circumference of the tire, then ended up doubling up for a few inches. I probably could have been more OCD about putting each light on each spoke but, meh, it looks fine. You don't NEED zip-ties for these to stay put, but I recommend using them, just so things stay in place over time and in a variety of conditions.  These are REALLY nice and BRIGHT and have a few settings, too, which I don't know if the advertisement mentions (they blink, etc.).  I can't believe what a deal these were. I really love them and they are FUNCTIONAL. If you can't spring for Monkeylectric lights (which I have on my other bike), then these are the way to go. :)
0,Carries 40 oz and is the same diameter as my 32 oz nalgene just taller. No leaks after almost a year, and I even trust it to be next to my iPad inside the same bag. Never have trusted a nalgene with that.
0,Very Nice
0,These gloves are outstanding. Look and feel amazing. Plenty of support. They are so nice I don't set them on the floor. I use them and so do my 20 year old sons.
0,I love these gloves and would be sooooo happy if you carried them again. Nothing like them out there.
0,I was impressed with these and agree with all of the positive reviews. I ordered them specifically to be able to clearly hear call outs during match competitions at my local shooting range while still providing hearing protection without having to bother with them.  They were great for this purpose and seemed to work just as advertised.  Having said this, I'm returning them anyway because I found it difficult to get a good rifle cheek weld with them on.  It can be done, but not without the headphones contacting the stock and I found this to be distracting.  That's to be expected with any over-the-ear muffs, so I can't fault the product.  The ear cups do have small cutouts and rubber bumpers to help with this, but I didn't find these to help all that much.  For pistol shooting or other environments with sharp impact noise, I'm sure these would be fine, but I'm back to my low-tech inside-the-ear plugs.
0,Love it! Lots of storage and live the drop-down pocket table for easy access!
0,Seems like a fine football for the price.  It is a little more like rubbery than I thought it would be.  The rubbery feel is good for my young kids' grip though.  I liked the model that was showing on the website, with the black swoosh, but that's not what showed up; the more traditional with the white end stripes is what we got.  The tip also seems deformed a little bit, but I don't think it will affect the flight of the ball.  One interesting thing about it, now that we've had it for a couple months, is that it doesn't gather dirt easily.  We play with it mostly in the street, and you normally get that road grime on balls, but this has stayed really clean, maybe it's the rubber.
0,Great
0,These are a nice size ice pack for my medium size lunch bag. I've had them about six months and they are still going strong. These packs are the perfect size for what I need. They are not too big and not too small.
0,Only 700 miles so far, but happy with it to date.  Re-lube the chain every time I cross 100 miles.	Used Gold for a long time and very impressed with it (about 7K miles on my chain) - wanted to try a cleaner version, so I went to Red this time.
0,nice fro price
0,I gor this yoga mat for my boyfriend's birthday gift. I was hesitant to get it because of the 4 star reviews. However, my boyfriend absolutely loves it. He uses it every day. I decided to get one for myself. People keep complaining about it being slippery but i have never had a problem. Maybe they have sweaty feet or are wearing socks? It's a great, comfortable product and I highly recommend!
0,Surprisingly comfortable for a foam pad. Have not taken it backpacking yet but it fits nicely on my pack and is very light. I am 5'9 and purchased the small, which I am able to fit my head down to my hips on it comfortably. If you are interested in buying a 3/4 sized sleeping pad I believe you will not be disappointed by the size small if you are 5'10 and under.
0,Lightweight and comfortable. Firearm held securely but draws easily... Highly recommended...

I personally don't use the the little sheath.  I just clip it straight into my pocket.	I like knives with the tanto style tip, like this.	Nice, ergonomic feel.	Fast deployment.	Stays put and doesn't accidentally open (at least for me... can't say the same for others).		Note: It's a TIGHT pocket clip. You'll have to loosen it up or it will grip your pocket way too tightly.
0,If you are going snorkeling, YOU NEED THIS! This stuff is amazing and worked so well on our recent trip to Mexico. We ran out and I wish I would have bought more because it makes a huge difference. I will be a return customer.
0,Got a great deal on these.  Had a bad experience with delivery but Amazon customer service made it right.  The dumbbells are great because they hardly take up any room and they can be light enough for my wife and heavy enough for me.  Yes, they are kind of expensive but after owning them, the price is justified because of their ease of use, minimal use of space, and attractive appearance.  Don't let the price scare you away.  I like them enough that I'm thinking about getting the heavier models too.
0,Cool, fun little item to include with the hiking and camping gear. It makes sparks like it should, although I'll probably stick to lighters for regular use.
0,Perfect for a cold army field and extremely comfy
0,I ride about 10k miles a year and I've tried all sorts of different tires.  I keep going back to these time and again.  They are the best all around tire I can find.  I generally get about 3 or so months out of the rear tire.  The front tire might get 5 - 6 months.  I still get flats from time to time, but they do a lot better than any other brand I've used.  They aren't quite as responsive as a pure racing tire, but for daily riding they are great.		I would recommend the folding tire instead of the wire.  The latter is insanely hard to get onto the rim and even worse when doing it on the side of a road with just a tire lever to work with.
0,I only wear these shorts now.  They may be tactical shorts, but they have so many uses.  The little metal hoop on the front is perfect to attach my car's keyfob to so that it do not have to bulk up my front pocket.  I have type 1 diabetes and have an insulin pump, so I use the front velcro pocket that is supposed to be for an extra gun clip to hold my pump.  It really makes it discreet and I don't look like I am back in the late 80's wearing a pager on my hip.  The sizing is a bit of a problem, I have bought multiple pairs in the same size, and a few run small, but returns are easy.
0,I have been buying these socks for the past 3-4 years. They wear forever, wash up well, and are NOT hot in the summer.  I wear them to the gym for exercise and my feet stay dry and comfy. Definitely will buy again.
0,And the price is right.  Will hold my Marlin 795 for a trip to the range, which is what I was looking for.  Should also be fine for the Savage Rascal.
0,As promised.
0,Awesome belt, very sturdy and stiff.
0,aok
0,Got this for a student to carry in school - he reports that it isn't "sweating' in has backpack, he is able to use the loop at the top to keep it attached to his pack when he isn't drinking, and no reports of the water tasting like plastic.  Very happy with this water bottle.
0,Happy with the product
0,Using this for my go bag for emergency purposes. Product came fast. It's smaller than I thought it would be, so that's plus. Never know what can happen and this is definitely something to have around.
0,I ended up buying two of them they're reasonably good in my opinion I probably put somewhere around 7000 km which is about 5000 miles and they're still holding up phenomenally
0,This waterproof bike pouch is made of good sturdy materials, the clear plastic screen is clear and sensitive to the touch. My phone fits in there without any problem, i didn't have to take my case off. The two side pockets have me enough room for my stuff, and even some room for snack for my baby.	The pouch fits on the bike really well, i was  afraid that it might show off but the Velcro holds it real tight. The zippers zip smoothly.	All in all, this is a good bike pouch. I bought this at a discounted price to test it out and leave an honest and unbiased reviews
0,What can you say about a boat flag?  Well, this one is cute, well made and easily visible. I am sure we will be using it for many years.  Taylor made products last.  And of course, Amazon is great with the pricing and getting it to you in a timely manner.
0,Used it once to save a BBQ. I keep it in the car with two poles...always ready
0,Good watch does what it says. The only gripe i had was that the transceiver has to damp or slightly wet to get going but that'd happen after you started jogging or running around anyways. Works fine has a night mode for running which realy stands out(bright neon) in a way ive only seen this watch do. Sturdy band which doesnt slip out, and as ususal with any watch with a rubber watch band sweat resistant and very easy to clean. I believe the transceiver battery lasts 8 hours which is plently enough for me yet i wouldnt be suprised if it lasts longer.	  Simpley put on the HRM transceiver make sure damp or wait a few minutes after you start your workout and press the HR button.
0,Perfect for kindergarten and perhaps up to 2nd grade. It holds a classic 3 ring folder, lunch bag, and a few reading books, but nothing more. However this is all our kindergartener has needed. It is smaller then the "classic" book bags that most elementary school kids use, but it fits the this little kindergartener kid perfectly. Good quality and durability.
0,It works just fine. Too bad the gun sucks. Just get a gas blowback pistol. I did and I never use this one anymore.
0,Works well.
0,Very nice and warm.
0,Good quality short. Really confort to ride. Once I bought it I thought it won't fit because the short looks really tiny. but no, once you try it, it's fix perfectly.	I bought a XS, Waist 27" Hip 29"
0,Perfect product.
0,Holds alot of equipment, put an 18" AR in the front and youth shotgun and 22 rifle in the back.
0,I got this not really for the rain protection, but for the visibility factor since my pack is black and I want people to be able to see me easily. It packs into its own built-in storage pocket and it also has a mesh pocket that is separate - it might help it to dry out if it gets damp. The only securing system is the rubberized cord with lock slider, so I got some small carabiners and put holes in the cover near the edge and use those to secure it to my pack, which it just barely fits around.
0,I've had several ropes, and this is the best.  Padded, textured, and curved handle makes this super comfortable.  Line seems durable, though after 3 years, it showed obvious signs of wear.  My kids like to take out a section for wakeboarding with adults using the full length.
0,Love the shirts and the price was perfect for my budget defenely will order again my merchandise arrived on time
0,A nice bench for light use.
0,If you like tiny knives its fine.  But almost too tiny except to cut twine and open packages, which when you think of it is what you use a pocket knife for. Invisible in your pocket.  Tiny so not sure how tough it is.
0,I WILL HAVE LEFTOVER PATCHES WHEN I DIE. THANK YOU
0,you won't get lost if you use these tacks. Great for locating your tree stand.keep them in my back pc.great product!
0,Was really impressed with axe. Looks and works good too!
0,Awesome hat.  It gets unsolicited compliments.
0,I like these beach volleyballs better than all the others.  They are fun to play with and hold up extremely well.  Not everyone prefers these but they are particularly good in windy conditions.  I have found them to be fairly consistent ball to ball.  I have played with, literally, hundreds of them.
0,great ball.
0,Works
0,I needed this to eliminate the irritation the Cue was causing on my hand. It works better than putting on powder.
0,Cute little handlebar bag with a number of various size pockets.  Good for wallet, keys, and a couple other small necessities.  Velcro straps keep it in place well and the bright yellow rain  cover is a great idea with a handy place to stash it.  Zippers are sturdy and I suspect they will hold up well.  It's a good size and doesn't get in the way of brake cables.  I would recommend it for any bike and rider.  It was delivered promptly and intact.

0,AWSOME PRODUCT, QUICK SHIPPING, AND I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED
0,Great cuality product,Work perfectly.
0,awesome bed - self contained and easy to setup/take down! and incredibly comfortable!
0,Fit perfect on my AR.  Still getting used to having a scope rather than a red dot.  These mounts help keep zero even after transporting to and from the range in a soft case.  No problems at all.  Although, until I get better with acquisition with the scope, I wish I went with quick detach mount or the Burris Peppr mount.  I miss my red dot.  Takes me a lot longer to get eyes on target with the scope.  Love the mounts though.
0,love it
0,Fit right and works perfectly, installs in minutes.  We took the cooler on vacation and had between 3 and 10" of cold water and ice in it the whole time. 7 days of service and not a single drop leaked.		Day after we got home the hinges broke.  Good thing I already have a spare replacement set of those.
0,works well although slightly blurry. Great value.
0,nice
0,Excellent product for rehabbing a tennis elbow!
0,Excellent tire. Resists flats and tread goes forever
0,very happy with these, I like the main lens , I can see well no matter the conditions, never needed to use the 2nd lense for sunless days.
0,Great little knife. It's heavier than I would want but I can eliminate scissor & tweezers from my 1st aid kit to make up the difference.
0,Great product
0,Glass is very clear with no obvious "color", the focus/ center adjustments work very well and the mount is SOLID.  Having used some of the pricier "big name" triplers, the Burris is every bit as clear.  And did I mention that the mount is SOLID (and flips to the right, for a right handed shooter).  The Burris combo is a great value.
0,Purchased 2 of these rechargable batteries for my Thompson 1927 air-soft rifle. These batts are the bomb, much better than the original. I also purchase the charger which beats the pants off the original charger that came with the Thompson.
0,Nice big face digit watch, Fits well and durable for my small wrist. Awesome color too. Very happy with this watch.
0,Adds comfort after a long day without all the weight. If backpacking, I might suggest the longer version; this would eliminate the need to bring a sleeping mat. (provided it's not winter, since it would not be a full length mat)
0,Razor sharp; I'm sure will fillet some meat.
0,I live in a very sunny state so require a shirt that's light weight and very comfortable but love the idea of an SPF of 50 for extra protection. I sent for these shirts with some apprehension since 5 good cotton long sleeve T's can be purchased for the came price as this. I considered the high praise of most of the reviews and that coaxed me into giving this shirt a chance. They arrived and now I don't want to take them off in my leisure down time. The silky comfort is beyond description. Extremely light weight and body fitting but without any feeling of confinement. The cut and stitching is efficient with just enough visual style to be non boring. Sleeve length is perfect. I bought a black and a white which are timeless paired with jeans or even working out. I'll see how they hold up in repeated washings, but if all remains the same will buy two more soon. Highly recommended for comfort, functionality and look!
0,I was lucky enough to meet Arnold Palmer one day and he gave me one of his golf balls and signed it!!! Jackpot.  Anyway this is the perfect piece to showcase your special memento. The top is glass and the back of the display is mirrored.  Very classy looking.
0,I don't expect to need to use these sights on my Coyote rifle but should my Optic fail me in any way the culling of pest need not stop.
0,UPDATE:  Seller replaced.  Totally satisfied.  For ~30 dollars I expected more. The plastic cover over where you put the key in came off the first time I used it. Will keep this one but would not buy again.
0,I just got into Scuba diving and I bought this mask after trying on a few others. This is by far the most comfortable mask I have tried on.
0,Love, love this top.  Wish there were more in this style to purchase.  I got a large and wear a 8-10 regular shirt.
0,Still a bit tight one size up, but way too big in a larger size than that. A shoe stretcher helps make a better fit.
0,It's a little small if you intend to stuff everything inside it (it certainly won't hold your gear) but for a 5'4" 140 pound guy I can fit myself, a sleeping bag, and thermarest Zlite in there without too much trouble. Breathability isn't perfect, but is great considering how cheap this thing is. For a "True" bivy I would suggest the three letter acronym store's minimalist bivy as the next step up
0,Very high quality. No smell or odd powder like some.
0,I wear a size 32" or 33" pants and a 34-36" belt. I ordered a size Medium in this and I fall right around the middle hole so I have room to move either way depending on how close to Thanksgiving it is :)		I've had this belt for 6 months now and have used it for squats (315) and deadlifts (405). It is a very stiff belt, so make sure you have it adjusted right before you start lifting heavy. If you're not used to a stiff belt, it takes a little time to get used to, but it is definitely worth it.		I have no complaints about it. The leather is high quality, the rivets and buckle are all working great (I did see another review where a rivet broke, but mine are all in great condition still). The only thing I don't particularly like about it is how large the logo is. If I get too tired of it, I can just remove the stitches and take it off but for now I've just left it as it is. I have used some higher priced belts, but I can't think of anything that was more special about those belts that would make it worth twice the price.
0,One of my favorite firearms is very hard to find holsters for.  I prefer leather and the very few companies that makes that size in leather, takes months to be made and shipped.  I came across this one, it's very affordable, fits my spefic firearm and is available now.  It came and it is perfect.  Will absolutely stick with this brand.
0,Work well for the Price.
0,Perfect for our needs.  We really like that there were length options.
0,Excellent pack.  Well designed, very comfortable, and lots of desirable features.	I can recommend this pack without reservation to anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors with a load on his/her back.
0,Great bottle for my work out routine. I love the one-handed operation.
0,This is the definition of a well made knife.  You already know about the steel, the company, the reputation.  The only complaint is that it is bigger than anything I would normally carry in my pocket.  The knife is NOT good for lefties and I am obligated to open it in a way that is less than ideal.  Other than that though the knife is something Conan the Barbarian would have had as a backup.  Great knife, just big in the pocket.
0,Works great and cheap!
0,This review is for The Waterproof Dry Bag for Boating, Kayaking, Fishing, Rafting, Swimming, Floating, and Camping with free Waterproof case. (by Smartdoo)	This is such a cool bag! It is tough and durable and waterproof.  We have friends who own a boat, and when we go out on it, there are some items that I just want to keep dry. This is perfect for that!! It is just like it is described and that is always good. It is a good looking bag also. It is not too big but just right for what you will need on a short trip. It has a smart way that it closes and stays closed and keeps everything dry. We love it!!	  I hope you have found this review helpful to you. I have had the opportunity to purchase this product at a reduced price or at times even for free in return for my fair and honest opinion. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and I receive no incentives or rewards. Every item is used and tested before I review it. My comments are sincere and are of my own opinion or that of the family member, (and sometimes both) for whom I purchased it for. Thank You!
0,good
0,When I first got it I thought I ordered the wrong size because it was so much smaller than my original but I put it in my (M) Everlast leather bag and two weeks later its still holding air.
0,Zap. That light is amazing. You could probably just blind an attacker.
0,Bought these for my 11 year old for both indoor and outdoor soccer... Wow! I am also a coach and recommended these to all my players.
0,Nice shirt, great price
0,Speedo is the hallmark of professional sports swimwear and they look fabulous.  They do, however, fit VERY snugly all over.  I have a 30" waist (measured) and even the 32 feels a tiny but tight like compression shorts.  Guarantee a wave will not strip them off you.
0,This is a very hard to find coleman replacement globe. A lot of times the measurements were not accurate and would not fit the lantern. These were very accurate.
0,Great! Love it
0,My husband is pleased with these. Solid one-piece construction with nice padding.
0,Works and fits as per the description.
0,Work very well as long as I am shooting well enough to hit them
0,Love the fitbag. It fits comfortably over my upper back to do lunges, squats and walk the track for weigh tbearing for Osteoporosis of the spine
0,Nice quality, toasty warm.  Love it!
0,Cute purse. A little small. Quality seems ok. Straps are carelessly sewn on so fabric is folded over in places. Could use more pockets or a divider inside it. Luv the Broncos decal on it!
0,This light is extremely bright and makes sure you will be seen very far away. It has 6 different flashing modes that can all be adjusted to flash quicker or slower. Only argument would be that it would be nice to be able to adjust the brightness as well, since it is very bright.
0,Great release! Love the boa system! I have take 4 deer with it in just one season I'm hooked !
0,Looks good will update after I install it
0,Son loves these, but they do seem to wear quickly.
0,Great Scope for the price! I bought one just like this one 40 years ago, and I still use it today.
0,The best reloading die's Ive ever purchased and Ive purchased all major brands. These replace some cheap hornady .223 reloading die's the American series are to cheaply made. I just bought these to de-cap on a single stage lee press and the primer pin broke off so bad the die is useless to me. it broke the shaft and cannot be fixed. RCBS is the way to go make are to buy spare de-cap pins for any Die just in case you hit a berdan primer on a case.
0,I love the product...but it runs REALLLLY Small. I had to go up a size and its still pretty tight but better.
0,Great Bottle.  Doesn't leak.  Squirts.  Didn't warp in my dishwasher.  Exactly what I wanted.
0,Very affordable!
0,excellent
0,Who are these guys (Origin8)? They make really great stuff.
0,Fits my dog perfectly-14 lbs of chi mix! I put some cushion in the basket and I have a cloth basket liner for it. GoGo says Thank you, I get to ride!!!!!!
0,Works great
0,good quality and made for a perfect gift to a law enforcement friend
0,I love this optic.  I've bought two others and returned both.  This is by far the least expensive and by far the best.  Its super solid, I'm using it on a Ruger 10/22, but I think it would be fine on something more powerful.  Very easy to install and sight in.  This was my first successful optic zero in job that I did myself.  I love it; Definitely going buy the magnifier.	Two Words	BAD A**
0,This is very heavy duty & well made! Works great.
0,I was skeptical of the claim that this golf mat would give grass- or turf-like feedback; however, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this product simulated that feel.		I often hit off mats in my driving range, and when you hit a fat shot, the club head bounces off the mat into the ball, giving inadequate feedback. This product does not do that and gives you more feedback because the sliding mechanism allows the mat to mimic the feel of hitting off grass.		Also, this is the perfect tool for practicing indoors, and I have no fear of ruining my hardwood floor.		Dimensions:	- Turf: 10" x 19", with almost an inch tucked underneath the thick black plastic area.	- Entire mat including the mat holder: 11 1/2" x 23 1/2"
0,This my be odd but the big selling point for me on this is it has no harsh smell. I hit the range every week and my wife would say my aftershave was gun oil now with a new baby its not as cute to smell that harsh. The best part is this is really great stuff works awesome
0,We're very happy with this trainer, especially at the Black Friday price.  It was very well packed from the factory (I reshipped it to the Caribbean after it arrived in FL)  and I found it easy to assemble.  Seems like solid construction... time will tell, but we are satisfied with it at this point.
0,Super nice AR scope mount for the price.  Just as good or better than other fancy brands.
0,Works as intended
0,Sturdy design for pool training.
0,Perfection! Easy to assemble and use!
0,Easy open nice feel. I will be getting more of this knife.
0,Haven't gone out at night yet
0,Great sights. They work. But that are not night sights.
0,This is a kids hoodie.  It has a nice color to it.  Its made of 55% cotton and 45% polyester.  Its soft on the outside, and fuzzy on the inside.  There is no drawstring on the hood.  Kangaroo pocket on the front.  The A on the front is the rubbery type of material, so don't place it in a really hot dryer, otherwise it can melt/crack.  Measures 19 from the top of the shoulder to the bottom.  Sleeves measure 16 from where they attach at the shoulder to the end.  15 across, all the way down.  There is a tag in the neck.  Made in Pakistan.
0,It only hurts at first. LOL. It does seem to work though. Redirects pain by overwhelming your receptors and reduces pain temporarily in other areas. It does feel like a bed of nails though. After a minute or so does seem to induce endorphins and relaxation.
0,Good ring.
0,As expected
0,This a great helmet for the money. Very comfortable and easy to paint if you want a different color. If your family is in to any kind of hiking, trail biking, mountain climbing or any sport you need head protection, buy this helmet. Great to use if your in an area for frequent severe storms or tornado warning. It will keep your head protected.
0,I want this skirt in all the colors!  My daily wearer.
0,Not for combat, but for regular work.  Saves my hands/knuckles great!
0,I got these gloves for my son as a Christmas gift as he loves all things Bengals. I know he will love them. The gloves are not for warmth they are made more like a work glove but will be good in the spring and fall of the year, but not winter's here in Ohio.
0,This gives my P938 a much better grip.  Hogue grips are awesome.  I have them on multiple firearms.  I would definitely recommend this.
0,Good deal. Small package too carry
0,Keeps water cold
0,I started by ordering 5 pairs of these based on the reviews. I've always had problems with socks. I absolutely hate being barefoot, so I always wear socks around the house and when sleeping. With any other sock, eventually it stretches out to the point where it falls off my feet sleep while sleeping, and I would also constantly get holes in my socks, and partly from walking outside with no shoes on (taking out the trash, getting the mail, and the occasional grilling on the BBQ). These socks are also incredibly comfortable. They hug your feet quite nicely, and I haven't had a blister since I've been wearing them exclusively. I've now owned these socks for just over 6 months, and they've not stretched, nor acquired holes in them - and if they do, then DTV's no-questions-asked and lifetime warranty is one of the best.		As of writing this review I've just ordered another 5 pairs, and I've thrown out all of my old socks in the drawer because I can't stand wearing them any longer.
0,I always ride with my big dog and feel bad for my little one since she cannot keep up! Well no longer a problem! She rides a long and has a great time! Its sturdy and she feels safe. I love of the pockets and options. I'm so glad I found and purchased this!
0,Works. I don't see how it could not, lol
0,great item at a great price
0,Caught many backcountry sierra trout over the summer with these. My given trail name is T2 (trout terminator). Most my fish were caught on these flies. Not super durable but they did catch dozens of beautiful fish. Would buy again.
0,The Quality of this piece, went high beyond my expectations.. Being a Sword Smith, I was expecting  a much thinner blade with no tang. The Back piece is very well made as are the sheaths that hold the swords.. Most definitely would recommend this item & seller
0,Excellent, 2nd Pair!
0,Haven't used it yet, but before you check box that this is a worthless review, consider this.  I grew up in the tire business and have personally repaired literally thousands of tires of all kinds.  Tubes, tubeless, car, truck, farm, and yes, bicycles.  And I've used all kinds of technologies inclusing cold vulcanizing, hot vulcanizing and even use to "Plug" tires.  Thats really dating myself.	This kit appears to be quality and has what it would take to repair a tire or tube.  Consider a few tips if you are unlucky enough to get a flat.		1  You can't rush the job.  If you think you are going to be back on the trail in 5 minutes then you are gonna be disappointed.  I might be able to get back on the road in 10 minutes, but per above, I am experienced fixing tires and tubes.		2  Don't skimp on the buffing part.  Get a good buff in a larger area than the size of the patch you will be using.		3 More glue is NOT BETTER.  It's not.  Trust me.  Vulcanization is a chemical reaction to the rubber of the tire or tube, the glue, and the adhesive on the back of the patch.  Its all about balance to get it right.		4 You have to contour the patch to the inside of the tire or the tube.  Don't use a bigger patch than you have to.  Especially on a tube.  Less is better.  The tube will be flat when you do the repair, but once back in the tire and inflated it will change shape.  To large a patch can do weird stuff under pressure and actually cause problems including another flat tire which will likely result in a catastrophic event to the tube.		5 If you have slime or some other kind of flat proof stuff in your tube, you need to be extra diligent to get everything clean before trying to do a good patch job.  What you really need is a product called "Buffing Solution" but this is not something you are going to pack on your bike.  Its more of a product you have in the shop.		Bottom line?  This product is totally capable of fixing your flat tire or tube.  The question is, "Are You"!  If you never patched a tire or tube, then I have a great recommendation.  Buy this kit and keep it on your bike.  If you are not far from home, give it a go.  Thats how you learn.  If you jack it up you can walk or call your buddie/family to rescue you.  If you are in the middle of nowhere, consider flagging a good samaritan that may have experience fixing tires and let them fix it for you.  A $5 tip, or giving up your sandwich or avocado to the Samaritan is a great investment...
0,Very strong plastic whistle.  I keep one clipped to my PFD and I put some cord through another one that I keep on my jacket.  Did I mention it's L-O-U-D!!!
0,I have a bit of a collection of camping stoves, from the ubiquitous Coleman 2 burner stove to the Optimus 111B and Svea 123. This is a very practical little stove. I bought it because it is the only kerosene burner I own. I use kerosene for backup heat at my house and thought it would be nice to have a stove that burns this fuel. I bought a couple gallons of high grade white kero fuel at Lowes and tried this in the 550.  I have primed the stove with both alcohol and with an alcohol gel starter. When I use denatured alcohol to start, I tilt the stove to keep the alcohol under the generator while it heats up. The stove then instantly lights without any flare up. Although the stove is rated at a bit lower output using kerosene, it burns over 2 hours on a tank full. If you are going out for a trip of a few days, you can leave the fuel bottles at home and this stove is lighter in weight than a canister stove and two canisters, which deliver the equivalent burn time. Do the math. On white gas, it is real easy. Pump to pressure, light, and it will light immediately, although with a bit of flare till it warms up the generator. Then it burns steady with a nice blue flame. I don't mind the plastic knobs and I haven't burned my hand once while adjusting, as others have suggested. I like the adjustability of the feet for uneven ground. As I write this it is the end of October and I have put away my little alcohol soda can stove, since the burn times are getting much longer in the lower temps. The Coleman is a great stove for the one stove guy, since it can do it all. If you only go out for one or two nights in only warm weather and you are a weight weenie, you can do better with a canister stove or an alcohol stove.  But if you want a stove for all conditions, this is a tough one to beat, since you can still get any parts from Coleman.		As an update to this review, I decided to change the generator back to burn Coleman fuel for a while. The tank didn't have much kerosene in it. As others have reviewed, it is difficult to empty the tank, so I decided to just burn the rest of the kerosene to empty the tank. What happened was interesting. Even though the tank had very little fuel in it, the stove burned over 1 1/2 more hours. I kept pumping up the tank since it had mostly air in it. This just illustrates how incredibly efficient this little stove can be on kerosene.		Okay, another update. I burned a bit of white gas and it behaves just fine. But I have several other white gas stoves (Optimus 111B, two Svea 123, Optimus 8R) which I enjoy burning more than the Coleman. So I changed it back to kerosene. I like this stove on kerosene and will likely leave it this way since it is the only kero burner that I own. It would be a good little stove for the one stove person unless you are a weight weenie.
0,Good quality for the $$$.  They are easy to une with one hand, I like that they flip up so when I go inside I don't have to remove them and then fumble around for something to put them in.  Other reviews stated that they were too big, but I found them to fit my glasses just fine.  There is a little overhang but it would be impossible to get a perfect fit unless you got them from your eye clinic from the same company as you got your glasses.  I got two pair of clip ons, each came with its own carry case, and they included a good quality cleaning cloth also.  Good buy!
0,I had recurring tendonitis in my right elbow. I've been using these bars to do the Tyler Twist (look up this exercise online - there's a good article in the New York Times about it).  Started out with the red bar and worked up to the green bar.  As far as I'm concerned these bars have completely cured my tendonitis.  I still use them to keep up the strength in my arms and prevent the tendonitis from coming back.
0,Excellent quality, very timely delivery - thank you!
0,Perfect for my P938
0,Easy to fit holds on to your top teeth well. I use it for Bruxism. Trying this one out before I go spend big bucks at the dentist.
0,Product is as described and works great !!
0,I get tons of compliments! "IS THAT A FIT BIT?!" It looks great after a few months of daily wear, and I'm a nurse so I wash my hands ALLL day and it still looks great!
0,bought two of these sets for a family event, everyone loved it of all ages, from 3yrs and up. the younger kids are challenged by it, great for developing coordination skills. and nice that it's multipurpose, can be a frisby or a ball game. downside: the cloth part is very delicate, i don't imagine it lasting long. can easily get caught in a tree and tear. fingers crossed!
0,Well made with a nice cloth case.  Goes in my get home bag.  I hope I never have to use it.
0,Very bright, love being able to recharge from usb since this is on my commuter and road bike.
0,This is a very strong pouch. The material is thick and strong. It is molle compatible, but does not come with a molle clip. I would recommend this product but definitely get a molle clip with it to make carrying on your pack easier without taking up any room inside your pack. The Cammenga compass fits nice and tight and doesn't bounce around a lot in it.
0,Very versatile holster. I have been able to use this on everything from compact's to full size 1911's. Downside is in order to make these fit you do have to take the holster apart and re-fit everything to make it all snug. The retention strap will not adjust as far on compacts but it still works very well.
0,Love it
0,great for travel
0,Very nice pedals - my shoes stick to them like glue. They seem very well made for the price (much better than a set I paid twice as much for.)		Just be careful, these will give you a nasty pedal-slap "bite" if you slip.
0,I have a Glock 19 and a Ruger LCP, and the Fobus holsters are the best.  They are sturdy and easily slip onto the belt and remains in place and secure.  Tighten or loosen the tension for your preference in the draw.  I've had holsters much more expensive, but this is my go-to holster.		It rides high enough for concealed carry underneath a shirt that isn't tucked in.  When I lift my arms, the bottom of the holster is exposed a bit, so I just try not to raise my arms that high when in public.  Your experience may vary depending on how long your shirts are.
0,The fit is good and the quality is nice, but the wrist straps are too thin and offer little support. I don't need much, so it doesn't bother me, but if you need wrist support I would get other gloves.
0,I just bought a couple of singles, to test before a backpacking trip, one of which was the Mac & Cheese, and I used my solid fuel stove. I noticed that the water was very hot but not a roiling boil. I poured it in and waited the 8:30 minutes. Much of the macaroni was still crunchy. I microwaved it a bit. Still crunchy. Microwaved it more for a few minutes and it came out perfect. It was soooooo tasty. I actually served it as a side with dinner for 3. I got the roiling boil with the breakfast sample and it turned out great. I would be totally willing to eat crunchy macaroni while camping, but when cooked perfectly, it's a true delight. I'm going to try this again with the boiling water.
0,Fit and worked perfectly for my old light. My old bike was stolen and this bracket was cheap, shipped quickly and worked perfectly for my old light.
0,These sights are Easy to install, sight/adjust, and use. I'd recommend these to anyone, worth the buy, and can't go wrong.
0,Works beautifully and looks awesome on my Ruger 10/22 bull barrel rifle.  Not much dialing of the scope was needed with this 20 moa rail.  It's long enough to mount a large optic.
0,my job as a security gaurd in the night shift had trouble looking  around me had a couple of other flashlights but im most satiffied with diablo flashlight it makes me feel safe when doing my patrols around dark spots having a flashlight with a stungun im thinking of gating onther diablo thanks to the makers of doing a great flashlight
0,My daughter is a young U12 player (11y/o) and we ordered this bat for her this year. She absolutely loves this bat. It has reduced the number of "stingers" she has gotten which has made her much more confident and aggressive at the plate. The sweet spot is fairly large on the barrel of this bat which helps young kids gain confidence hitting the ball. Obviously the bat is expensive but considering the other costs associated with this sport I think it is money well spent. There is no question that the bat has increased my daughters abilities at the plate.		I can't speak of the durability and life of the bat but to this point it seems to be holding up well. We own a pitching machine and use the "softer" balls which the bat has handled fine. There is no question this bat will get a ton of use over the next few months by my daughter with daily batting practice, team practices every few days and actual game/tournament play. Most commercial cages use softballs that are MUCH harder than the balls we use in our machine so, I wouldn't recommend using this (or any composite bat) in a commercial batting cage. In fact, the warranty card states that the warranty might be voided by using the bat in commercial batting cages.		UPDATE: After one month of HEAVY use, my daughter absolutely loves to hit with this bat. We have run 50-75 balls through our pitching machine 3-5 times per week and the bat is holding up fine.
0,Purchased this to make a winter Garland for my Daughter's party and It's coming out Wonderfully.
0,Much larger than I thought it would be.  I am able to carry everything I need in it and more.
0,I like these cones much more than the ones I've found at big box stores.  They're very flexible and can take being stomped on without creasing, splitting, or losing their shape.  Great value and with 20, I never have to worry about having enough for soccer practice.
0,A perfect addition to my garage bike shop.  Sturdy and useful. Wish I had purchased it sooner.
0,After a lifetime of Swiss Army Knives and Buck Knives and Multi-tools, this is my second tactical style knife. The first was SNAKE EYE TACTICAL US AIR FORCE RESCUE STYLE ASSISTED OPENING KNIFE WITH CLIP. Nice enough knife, but I couldn't get it to open with the thumb stud. Okay, I thought, I'll pay a little more than $11 and get a better one. Based on reviews and price this RAT seemed like a screamin' deal. While waiting for it to arrive, some one showed me how to use flipper with the index finger on the Snake Eye. At which point I realized that was all the knife I needed. So, I ordered a Tac-Force EMT Edition Spring Assisted 3mm Thick Stainless Steel 2 Tone Tanto Blade rescue style knife for the little woman. It is exactly like the Snake Eye except for color and the EMT symbol. She loves it! For boxes, letters, etc.		Back to the RAT. I had a bit of buyer's remorse as I waited for it to be delivered. Since I had mastered the el cheapo rescue knife and was happy with it, do I send back the RAT? Uh, no. I ain't sending it back, no way. What a knife...solid build, great edge, great frame lock, great feel in the hand. Being new to this thumb stud style I found a video that showed how to open this particular knife with a quick flick of the wrist. Check out the many videos on youtube reviewing this knife, which I didn't do till after it got here. Everybody loves it and you will, too!
0,For the price, you can not beat it!!!  It work great, Very easy to install.  I have been shopping for a new one for several months. They can get really expensive.  But for less than $30.00,  Order this one. Its strong great quality. I would recommend this to anyone.
0,I am a 5 foot 2 inch female weighing 158 lbs. Just what I needed. I ride my bike to work. Haven't used it yet, but it fits perfectly! Came right on time :)
0,sweet
0,My favorite map for hot yoga. It is grippy if it is wet. For cold yoga...it's a bit slippery but fabulous for hot sweaty yoga
0,Arrived quickly and was easy to put together. I need to tweak it a tad bit to make sure the basket and top are both level, but even if off by a tiny bit, not a big deal. I will also add a 2nd set of inner chains to more accurately simulate course play. Nothing cooler than pulling this out of the shed and putting for 30 minutes before dinner, after dinner, whenever. I look forward to taking the course by storm with much improved putting and short game play. I also plan on using this to indoctrinate my kids. Thanks, Innova!

0,Great for survival pack!
0,I'm in my 30's and don't have a model-like physique, so modesty is key to me along with clothes that flatter my figure. I have to say, these shorts do both. They are like wearing a pair of sports/running shorts--not too short but not so long where they become matronly. When worn properly, they do help slim the tummy area. (I say properly because I was wearing them a little too low at first.) I bought these along with the Speedo Women's Primitive Paisley Crossback Tankini Swimsuit Top and both together were perfect. Playing in the water with a young child and between running around, bending down, picking him up and do a host of other things, these shorts never gave me a reason to worry. And the great thing is you don't need a coverup with them unless you want one. It's almost like walking around in summer shorts.		Big thumbs up on these!
0,They work well, not just for tactical operations (paintball) but also for laying flooring.
0,nice tight case,well made
0,I use this for cleaning brass cases before reloading them.  I just add a couple of squirts of this stuff between batches and I think it helps add a little shine.
0,Light weight and easy to carry. Very stable on uneven ground. I weight 344 pounds and I was more than happy with the stool. I can only walk a short distance and I have to stop and rest, this stool provided me with the stop anywhere and anytime ability.
0,Good
0,I am in LOVE with this Yoga Towel!  I'm uber new to the Yoga world and so I don't have an actual mat to go inside this yet, but this for now works fabulously for me!  I love that it has a non-stick surface making it pracitical for doing Yoga and not having to worry about your mat slipping and sliding.		I like that when I DO have the luxury of getting an actual mat, this will easily fit snuggly around it, because it has two pockets on either side in which you can slide your mat in and make your Yoga Towel secure and able to stay in place!		The colors are insanely gorgeous!  Very calming!  And the towel itself is very cozy!!  I would definitely recommend this for anyone in the market for a new Yoga Towel, I've tried a few and this one is top notch!  Another feature that I haven't yet experienced with any other Yoga towels, is the fact that it actually comes with this CUTE bag!  So, It has it's own carrying case!  LOVE it!		I think this would make a great gift for anyone who loves to exercise or do yoga!		I received this product for review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions are 100% honest and my own!
0,Good
0,Works as described. Will have to it a few times and get an average. Only goes up to 11. Looks well made
0,These bottles work great. Even crushed ice doesn't completely melt after sitting for 24 hrs.	Cap fits securely and doesn't leak.	The only drawback is It's hard to get whole ice cubes into the opening.
0,Works well, as advertised
0,My wife love this fruit infuser. It works great and is easy to clean.
0,good..
0,I love this hat. It's so cute and fits perfectly. In the gym it keeps my hair out of my face and helps me focus with my eyes covered a little bit, outside it's great for sun protection.
0,sturdy and comfortable but the design is standard so it was made to fit between small and big guys.  the chest and shoulder was great fit for average 40-42in but the sleeves were long, about 34-36.  overall, it is comfortable and love all the pockets when you carry backpack.
0,Does exactly what it's supposed to do; what more can you ask?
0,This is a good "device" for stretching out calves, hamstrings, toes, and making "down dog" easier if your heels don't reach the floor. Very good training device.
0,Perfect training pants!!!
0,This is a durable bore brush that lasts a lot longer than the typical brass/bronze brushes.
0,I am pretty happy with this product.  I put it on and went in laid in the deep grass in the woods behind my house.  My wife and son both watch me walk out there and they said I just disappeared into the ground as I went prone.  My daughter came out looking for me; was within 3 feet of me and had no idea where I was.		I am 6'2" 380 lbs.  The fit is nice, but for a guy my size... find some matching pants to completely blend because it will be a tad short and the sides will be open due to your girth.  My son is 5'10" 180lbs and it was an obsolete perfect fit.		All in all, good deal.
0,This is perfect for your pocket or belt.  Great blade, bottle cap opener, cork screw, foil cutter, and flat head screw driver.  Has a clip to wear on your belt or an eye, to attach to a leather leash or key keeper.
0,There are a lot of them and many different sizes too. They are used for fishing and you can catch with them too.
0,Good bag for the commuting I do. Often can just fold up the sides and use the center compartment but if needed the side bags easily accomodate a set of clothes and lunch.  Also large enough to hold folders and books etc.  Locks in securely to the Topeak rack that I also bought.
0,I had a relatively painless install on my IS fork. My wheel had holes for the 6 screws to install the discus and everything went smoothly. I've ridden a few times down a hill where I'd apply the brakes for a minute continuously and I haven't seen any anomalies on the discus or the braking unit.		5/2/2014: Put loctite on your bolts when securing rotor. That way your rotor bolts won't be shaken loose while you ride.
0,Doing the program now love it
0,Great Product!!!! I thought I would have to spend a lot more money to get this kind of power from a light and especially with no battery pack. Light is not bulky and looks good on the bike
0,Worked well as an underskin for a neoprene wetsuit.
0,Very nice Goggle.
0,I have always trusted these tubes and they have given me no reason to do otherwise!
0,works great
0,Everything was just as described I would use them again if ever I need any thing for my crossbow or other hunting needs
0,A wonderfully adorable cap for my 18 month old grand baby.  This is a nice soft fabric and fits a bit sung.  She loves the tie ends and enjoys playing with them.
0,i liked
0,so far good 2 me since i catch couple rock fish
0,So far good rims, but people who have reviewed them didn't know what they were saying. They are super light.... You need a cassette not a free wheel for these rims....
0,Works as expected.
0,loved them
0,My favorite edc fixed blade I called bradford knives and spoke to the owner this man cares about every knife that goes out I called him to order things that weren't on Amazon not a problem so stop thinking about it and order it
0,Good quality and fit
0,Good bag for the money
0,Awesome light just remember to slightly unscrew the head when not using or you battery will go dead in storage mode. This is the only flaw but I have no issue turning it back to tight and then use the light during the operation. I already own 7 of these for all my weapon platforms. Awesome product and quick detach
0,Why the heck DON'T you need a tactical boonie in German Flecktarn?		It fits true to my hat size, well made, good looking, offers the right amount of shade while I'm fishing and the girlfriend hates it. Bonus.
0,I like this product OK and recommend.
0,Easy to set up.  Works great.  Solved a number of mysteries as to what goes on in the night around our property.  Attached video shows it in black and white but it also does color photos in daylight.  This was set only to record after dark...and look what it shows!  Does use 8 AA batteries so I'd recommend grabbing a charger and a 16 pack of the Panasonic AA rechargeable batteries.  Description says it will last up to a year but set to take 10 second videos with sound you get about 950 videos on a charge.  If it is going off 2-3 times a night it might last a year, but usually a subject keeps triggering it over and over.  We get about two weeks on a charge.
0,All the little parts you need for a high-hours stove.  Perfect if you have a stove made in the past 15 years.		What is now called the XGK stove (pointing-up blowtorch snowmelter) was the first product of a tiny Seattle company.  Kit does not work with the oldest MSR stoves that use 4-tab flame spreaders.
0,Excellent
0,seem to run small
0,Not installed yet but looks as if it will work as intended.
0,I have been on the search for the perfect water bottle. Tried Nalgene: after a few months the water starts to taste like the plastic. Tried Camelbak: The rubber/plastic top of the bottle starts to become all frayed and falling off even though I always hand-washed it. This water bottle far exceeds its competition. The lip is extremely smooth and comfortable, which you wouldn't think matters, but once you try this water bottle, all others pale in comparison. Everything about it is super functional. I love the handle and locking closure. Also, even though the base tapers to be a little wide, it still fits in my cup holder which is perfect. I'm very happy with the color choice, and the product overall. If I had to say there was a con, it would be the fact you need to use a bottle brush or soak some soap in it, because your hand definitely will not fit inside.  Would definitely recommend and would purchase again.
0,Nice product for the money, it is a little on the small side compared to other bags which is what I wanted, I bought it to keep a spare tube and C02 gear in a bag separate from my under saddle pack because I don't use the tube often (hopefully!)
0,As advertised, thank you
0,These ankle bands work great for pre-dawn and night rides.  They are easy and quick to strap on.  The reflective material does a good job of reflecting car lights making cyclists' legs easy to see for approaching vehicles.  Highly recommended for cyclists, joggers, walkers who like to exercise before dawn or at night.
0,It has a great flash range,,, but can be a downside on close up game,,, video quality is nice even for a cam that's not a true 8mp cam ( it's enhanced from a lower mp) slight blur on movement but that's normal for IR cams. It has taken video @ -8f so it works well in the cold.	I have not had them long(own 3) but have over 800 videos( I don't use photo).	Now the down side,,,, the detection zone is a bit wider than the view,, I have deer that show up a few videos after a blank or 2,, this is to offset the somewhat slow trigger speed. Even though I get blanks I don't mind,, remember you're only watching a small area,, any sign a critter came through is a plus,, even if it walks just outside if view. This beats a cam w a narrow detection zone,, that only pics up critters in the center (cuddeback is 1) & let's critters walk through it's view while not triggering.	I own 3 bushnell HDs,,,, this cam  it is pretty close if not better than the HDs	  1 browning spec op,,, this cam is sooo much better than the spec op	  1 stealth cam older model no video	  & 3 of these m880s		  I would recommend this lil cam,,, it's price is great for the quality you get... I plan on buying 5 more.....
0,Great targets...
0,Puts out GREAT sound, but there is no way to know if your putting too much air in it. It advertises that you get 50 half-second blasts, but because you don't know when to stop pumping it up (for fear of over inflating it, and causing it to pop), you never get the full potential of the horn, plus you're constantly recharging it with the included bicycle pump. But it DOES put out LOUD sound. I would recommend.
0,it like rcbs other products do as intended and do it well
0,Solid as a rock with absolutely no blade wobble whatsoever, Sharp As a Razor out of the box. A very good quality knife for the low price point.
0,Better than expected. Zero flaws. Well packed. Ordered the Yankee pitcher and catcher figurines as well. Should be a nice trio to display. Happy with this purchase.
0,I put one on my bicycle two weeks ago and I like it.  Can't speak to longevity but I can attest to the padding and it is good. I want to replace the saddles on all my bikes with these so I am very satisfied to this point. Time, may change that but my initial impression is 5 star.
0,I love spatter targets... these 58 year old eyes aren't as sharp as they once were, and a quick glance tells me how I'm doing.  Easy to spot results regardless of sky conditions.  Silhouettes for 7,10,12 yards, bullseyes for 25, 50 and beyond.  Trouble is, on bad days the other guys on the line next to me can easily see how off I am!  Great incentive to clean my glasses.
0,These mags work well and are sturdy.  They also happen to work in several other BB pistols which is nice.  Solid and easy to load.  These get a five from me.
0,ok
0,I use this sox when I go on long runs (10 miles or longer), they have nice cushion and very comfortable.
0,Highly suggest this pouch to anyone looking for a midsized pouch that can take a punch and keep on going. This pouch goes with me everywhere I go and it hasn't disappointed me yet.
0,This was perfect for my 4 piece rod (9') and an orvis clearwater rod. I love the color and the build quality is very durable.
0,My daughter was so excited to find this as one of her Christmas presents!  They do a lot of backpacking and she had been rigging something up to inflate her sleeping pad and pillow.  She was really happy to have this, and she said it would save her a whole lot of time and energy.  I like that it seems to be made well and can be useful for several different purposes.  She had this specific one on her list since one of their friends used theirs all the time with great success.  Glad I got it
0,First chamois cream I ever tried.  No need to try anything else.  Great stuff.  Don't ride without it.
0,It fits even the very, very old grey styles perfectly.  I got this to ride my Bike Friday on, but I need a different skewer, so watch out for that.  I have a Shimano Dual Drive, BTW.  It is also worth noting that you will want to raise the front of the bike as well, or you will be tilted forward like going downhill.
0,Work great and the price is excellent.
0,Love it
0,Works as intended. I would recommend!
0,Great watch. Last one lasted 7 years and 4 batteries. New one is a bit smaller, perfect size.
0,This is a well made hat and looks good after it's broken in.  It is a fitted cap and, in my estimation, ran a tad small. I'm a 7 1/2, which puts me in the center of their XL size range and it came too tight.  (There's another reviewer for whom this fit, so maybe there's variances in how they make them or mark sizes).  The solution was to wet it down and stretch it over a jello mold.  My jello mold happens to have a lip that conveniently grips the band.  After wetting and drying it on the mold over a couple days, I popped it off and it fits very comfortably.  Looks like it will wear well for a long time.
0,Excellent all around gloves for anything outdoors and, of course, for cycling. I took them on a quick ride this morning at about 48 degrees and, while it really wasn't windy, they did seem to help block the normal breeze generated from road cycling. This pair does seem a little thicker than the other Vbiger gloves I got, but I wouldn't say they are for extreme weather unless used as a liner. They are a soft almost neoprene feeling fabric that bends and stretches as you do, but stays in place with no fear of the gloves working themselves off or slipping off. All zippers and stitching seem well constructed, strong and secure. It's hard to get pics by myself, so I'm not sure how obvious it will be, but in the last couple of pics I am truly pulling at the seam and zipper as hard as I can. I've done this numerous times in different places on both gloves with no issue. The silicone honeycomb pattern goes from the base of the palm all the way through the tips of the fingers - stopping just short of the tip on the thumbs and index fingers - and does provide nice gripping assistance. The thumb and index fingers are tipped with a touchscreen compatable fabric that does indeed work well for my iPhone.		I have large hands for a woman, but not gigantic or anything, and ordered the XL thinking myself and my husband could both use them. They fit me well with just a tiny bit of extra space at the finger tips and are just a little snug where they zip on the back of the hand/wrist area for my husband. They fit me perfectly there - a little snug, but just enough that I know they're staying put. I would say these run just a little small and to order one size up if you're unsure.		I do see some issues mentioned in other reviews and have done my best to recreate those issues or test whether improvements have been made or perhaps I just got lucky? My pair seems strong and secure in every way. That said, if I do run into issues with them in the future I will update this review and share that information.		I received this pair at a discount to try out and honestly review. I've tugged and pulled at both zippers and seams and all seems great. Regardless, all opinions are my own and completely unbiased. The review would read exactly the same had I paid full price.
0,fit perfect on the henry 30 30
0,GOOD
0,Good product - good value
0,Wish I would have bought this mat a couple years ago!  This mat has taken my practice to the next level.  No more slipping!  Once I plant my hands or feet they stay in place.  Very easy to keep clean and with the closed cells I am able to wipe it down after my daily use.  I will never again use anything but my Manduka mat!
0,works great very heavy duty.
0,This pulley is a solid pulley and is working well on 10.5mm rope.  I have used it in a 3 to 1 RAD setup.  The friction is minimal and I feel very secure with it in place.
0,If you can stand the off-axis edge, it's a solid knife. Careful not to break the chain around your neck when pulling the knife from its sheath. Try encasing the chain in the outer layer of 550 cord. It worked for my dog tags, and makes the chain stronger and more comfortable the wear.
0,Great for small accessories.  I've found many uses for these.  They're a bit pricey, but the quality is much better than other tiny carabiners
0,great mask! We took it camping-no leaks, it does fog but we used the spray for anti-fog. Def. recommend this mask!
0,These are perfect for cleaning small areas. For me they are great. Thanks
0,good.
0,I have always owned a pair of slippers and wear them out in the every winter. I was constantly purchasing new slippers every year. either the bottom would wear out or just fall apart. I was purchasing the $30-$50 pairs. When i first saw this slipper i really liked it but did not feel like spending that kind o money on slippers that i would have to replace the following year. I made the purchase 4 winters ago and i am so glad i did. the slipper is the more comfortable them anything i have ever put on my feet. I wear the slipper out to stores on and on the the concrete. the bottoms are extreemly durable and after 4 years they still look like the day i recieved them in the mail. I am purchasing a new pair this winter because i want the new shoe feel and my old pair is getting ready for retirement. NOTHING WILL EVER BEAT THESE SLIPPERS!
0,Product was as described and delivered promptly. Works great.
0,works well to protect from bugs,	not big or heavy, not too much to lugg	around when camping or hiking too	easy to figure out, set up's easy to do.	not a tight squeeze like others have said,	now put this around your hammock bed.
0,You might be happy with a $100 knock-off magnifier if you never use the real thing.  Like everything EOTech this magnifier is quality.  You pay for it, but it is good stuff.  It has greatly expanded the usefulness of my black rife by extending my range for coyote while a touch on the release lever flips the magnifier out of the way for home defense.  But, as I get older I find that I use the magnifier more and more even on the firing range.		The only drawback is the price.  For a little 3x magnifier this thing is expensive!  I assume half it's cost is due to the high quality mount without which it would not be as useful.  Let's face it.  If you are looking at this optic your rifle certainly has a comma+ in the price so it's priced appropriately for a quality bit of kit.
0,I wish it was about 12 inches longer and It would be nice if the pattern was consistent. I'm not a fan of the changing size of the "knobs". Some are large and some are small. I find that the one sections works really well while the others don't work at all and this makes for a very small portion of the roller that actually serves a purpose. I rarely use and instead rely on my larger solid core foam roller.
0,It fits the Esee 3 just fine. I haven't had any problems with the stitching coming undone and the leather seems to be of decent quality.
0,I absolutely LOVE this tank. I purchased 3, all size small and they fit as expected. I know previous reviewers have commented that they thought the fabric was too thin however, I feel this fabric isn't any thinner than any of my other workout tanks. I also prefer a fitted type of silhouette and the small fits as expected without being too tight. For reference I'm 5'6" and 135lbs. I didn't feel it was too long or too short and I love the rouching add just a little bit more of a design feature. I didn't notice any chemical smell as others have noted and I wore this to heated vinyasa flow tonight and I still don't smell ant chemical trace. And the price...how can you go wrong? I will definitely be ordering more!
0,I like this item, thx.
0,Socks are comfortable. No complaints.
0,Very stable and very strong; I chose to use the last hole at the end of the rack for extra strength, and threw away the bag holders, and then I took heavy duty extra strong tie wraps and tied a heavy duty plastic box milk crate on the back, and threw a new 30 pack of beer in it and the rack had no problem.  I use this rack on a woman's ROADMASTER Granite Peaks 18 speed, and it will work also on a Mongoose 29 inch tires 21 speed.  Later, I went to the grocery store and I put two crates of 5 liter wine boxes full of wine, and I laid a 30 pack of beer on top of the wine crates, and I threw an 8 pound bag of potatoes in the box as well, and I threw a 3/8 galvanized chain 8 feet long in the box and drove very slowly, and the bike was a little unstable so it was no time to be stupid, and I could have drove nice and slow to the end of the World, and had myself a good party, and there is no way my old rack that screws into the bike frame could have handled this task.  You saved my Christmas Party Acomfort, and Thank You.  EYE 5
0,This worked great for sizing my new chain. I can't speak for how long it will last, but I just installed it without any issues and it seems to run great on my Shimano chain. Pricing seems reasonable too.
0,This is exactly the ticket if you want to carry a container other than a standard water bottle on your bike. I have carried various sizes of sports drink bottles up to 1 liter and a super-insulated stainless steel cup (like a Yelti). Very well made as one would expect from Arundel. I own several Arundel products and all are of excellent quality (They make the best bar tape I've ever used!).
0,I have been bass fishing for years and I have had many different scales. None of them pleased me as much as this one! I love the digital read out. I Put a 8 pound weight in a plastic bag and gripped the bag with the scale and it was right on mark with the weight. A scale and fish grip in one, you can't go wrong here.
0,Of all the options I looked at this is the one that was the most compact and the lightest. It does just what it is advertised to do, no more, no less. Like all titanium products I did find it pricey but that's the lay of the land and I can accept that. While the cut outs are designed to make this stand even lighter they also help it to shed heat and make it possible to store faster than otherwise. While that isn't a major consideration and in fact is a mere blip on the screen in the scheme of things I appreciate that because I hate to wait around when I'm ready to go, I want to go. That about sums it up.	I do want to add the one drawback that I found...You will not be able to use the simmer setting that is available on some Trangia and Trangia look alikes. I have yet to find a work around for that problem. Stil Five Stars is appropriate in my book..
0,;)
0,I have purchased 2 of these scopes and am very happy with the purchase.  The glass is very clear and magnification works just as good all the way to 24x. Good solid clicks when adjusting and once zeroed it stays zeroed.  Red and green lit reticle works very smooth and is not over powering the eye while looking through the scope.  Only thing I would change is the scope rings.  Recoil loosens them up quickly.  Other than that, I find this to be a great scope and we'll worth the money.
0,A must have in your gun cleaning kit!	This is the main tool I use when cleaning my hand guns, it gets in the hard to reach places.
0,Great product
0,I just got back from 4 days on the Inca Trail in Peru.  I used this to carry 2 passports and my Iphone 6plus with a thick rubberized protective cover (barely fit, but it made it.  Also had a small flashlight and a multitool.  Very strong with good zippers.
0,Great pair of cheap gloves with finger saves. Used them for a little over a season on turf with only the usual wear on the grip, no holes or tears.
0,Exactly as described, pump works great and the ball is very well made and quite durable.  Great value for the money!
0,On the top 10 pistols chart for a reason.  This HK is an accurate shooter with few moving parts.  Perfect for beginners and advanced players alike.  Solid safety and trigger group.  Will last for a long time.  At this price its easily a 5/5 star pistol.
0,Excellent product and service.
0,I bought these with a discount for reviewing purposes.  They are really cute.  The fit is nice and the stretch is perfect.  The material feels like absolutely nothing which is somehow comfortable and freeing.
0,Very useful little tool for mono or flouro. and attaches easily to many PFD's,
0,I have owned these socks before. They are great hiking socks or to wear around the house in cold weather.
0,This is a product that's nowhere near its competitors, and occupies a distinct product category. I'm not sure what it should be called. "Imitation Motorcycle Exhausts"?. When I tested it in my garage, I felt the sort of ear pain normally reserved for the higher end of a tachometer when you're operating a Harley Davidson in a confined space. I have nothing disparaging to say about its ability to get the attention of motorists and pedestrians.		Build quality as a whole is not great, as the device has a fragile feel to it that makes me think it won't survive too much constant use. Specifically, the mounting kit that comes as part of the horn is... inadequate. For starters, I couldn't get the mounting strap to affix tightly enough that the horn wouldn't dramatically move when hitting the kind of small but constant imperfections that define the roads of Honolulu. It became necessary to tightly wrap the mount with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Silicone-Self-Fusing-Tape/dp/B00HWROKAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Silicone Self Fusing Tape</a>&nbsp;in order to stabilize it. If using drop bars, bar tape would suffice.		The remote is helpful, as you can place it along your bars in a position that's a little more convenient. The strap design they use works a lot better when you don't need to concern yourself with a lot of weight. A small plug attached to a cable connects the remote to the horn, which detaches easily so that the horn can come with you. That works nicely. The slide-in clip where the horn connects to its mount is lame. I almost broke it when I first used it because it was so unresponsive.		If this wasn't such a fantastic way to get attention during emergencies, I'd mark it down quite a bit for the craptastic attachment point. As it stands, there is no substitute until you scale up all the way to a 1200 cc V-twin with impolitely loud exhaust pipes.
0,Great value.  Well made.  Very versatile.  Can be attached/removed in seconds.  definitely recommended.
0,Works as expected.
0,Did a fairly good job on my down coat.  It didn't get some of the makeup out, but I might not have prepared it properly
0,Works great. Sealed a big puncture in tire quickly and has held for weeks without leaking
0,I love my headband. I love the versatility and the color!! GREAT!!!
0,fit my Kahr CW .380 like a glove. i go back and froth from this one and a kydex one i had made.
0,There is nothing to dislike about this product. It is very easy and convenient to use the premoistened patches to clean, lubricate, AND protect your firearms. Being so easy to use also increases gun cleaning compliance. There's no need to purchase a bunch of different products or fancy equipment to get the job done. Add that this product is also eco-friendly, and why would you need to look elsewhere?
0,Very happy with product, looks fantastic. The only negative is that there are no bolt holes on the bottom of the frame, just on top.
0,Many current CRKT knives are over engineered with complicated gimmicks that fail too easily.  Not this one, a simple slip lock with a single wharncliffe blade.  It is small enough to carry every day, even in a work environment where knives are uncool. Handle design is a bit dressy with the curves and center of something that looks like mother-of pearl, in a sort of Art Deco style.  Those curves also make it easy to hold onto, even in this small size.  The blade shape comes to a nice sharp point, but the edge is very straight which makes it easy to sharpen.
0,High quality product.
0,I bought this item for two reasons. It's a super high quality Nightforce product. And second, it eliminates any sort of movement a pic rail style base would have with scope rings on it. Fewer moving parts=less areas for things to go wrong.	10/10. Would recommend.
0,not very useful for indoor swimming. the anti-glare or coating on it makes it really hard to see in low lighting pools.
0,Works as described.
0,This is so comfortable that I bought this tan one for my friend on his birthday. I use this for backpacking as well as car camping. I have slept on it in the bed of my truck when I didn't feel like setting a tent up. Lightweight, not very big when deflated and in the stuff sack. Overall I love this pad.
0,In my travels I somehow lost my current Logic earpieces and was prepared to buy a new pair of Logics but found these and was able to save some money.  Great fit! www.letsgohikeit.com
0,Fantastic goggle strap. We bought this strap for my six year old daughter who was constantly adjusting her goggles. They were cheap goggles from  Walmart that cost a few dollars. She seemed to spend more time adjusting them, interrupting her swimming. This has made a world of difference and been well worth the money. She'll swim for hours now, and the best part for me, less hair tangling.
0,Quick delivery, product was as expected.
0,great product, easy to use and enjoy clean water! life savor
0,This product is absolutely wonderful and I have enjoyed using it and I would recommend it to anyone do not hesitant to buy it.
0,I'm a size 10 and ordered a large. Very comfortable; they offer compression, and I can do long distance runs (18 to 20 milers) with happy feet and no blisters. Will run my first marathon with them. In fact, these are the only socks I ever want to wear.
0,Excellent quality and fit. Looks great
0,Just what I needed for my Schwinn Meridian tricycle.
0,Works great on Hog
0,I am very pleased with the Glock 17 plug. It was easy to install and looks great!!
0,Fine
0,This is the best floater for little kids! My kids love wearing them. And they can literally swim through deep water in This! Obviously, adult supervision is still required at all times, but makes our swimming alot less stressful on me.
0,My 4th purchase.  Love this stuff.  Big advantage for my projects is because this is a bit thicker, it really covers areas that the 550 cord does not - and does it in fewer wraps.
0,I wear this vest on runs and walks with my dogs at night.  I was looking for a cheap, but good quality and super reflective vest (for ladies) that I could use, and ended up purchasing this one.  It is SUPER reflective in the front- the waist belt, the stripes across the chest, and the edging of the entire vest reflects.  However, only the edging reflects on the back, there are no stripes running across.  I know this is called a 'walking vest,' but I just wanted to point out that while running, it does not stay on straight.  It keeps shifting forward and down, but that may be because I don't wear it tight enough and it is still a bit too big on me (Female, 5'3", 125lb).  I like it looser because I am running, so it's a give and take.
0,Use these on multiple brands of vacuum stainless bottles that I have bought from Amazon.  Good seal for avoiding leakage.  Easy to drink from for adults and tween/teen kids.
0,The dad's that didn't backpack it and the scouts wish they did.
0,This is a preliminary review of the saddle as I have only been on one ride since it arrived, and it was only a 40 mile bike ride. However, I can tell you that with my old bike saddle I would start to feel some discomfort by 40 miles. With the A.R.S. Anatomic Relief saddle I experienced absolutely no discomfort, so I'm currently, cautiously amazed with the results. I have to test it out on a longer route.
0,these guys make a great case...... buy it!!!
0,Great Glasses for the price.
0,I haven't used flat peddles since I was a kid. My thought was to put these on my fat bike so I can wear warm boots come snow time (clipless get full of snow and hard to use). I took the fat bike for a ride with these peddles (no snow yet). They were fine. I need to re-train myself to get used to them though. They gripped well with my snow boots and they look great.
0,Way too expensive for what you get but that is how they pay for the software.  It works.
0,I use this for hauling our family of 4's snorkel gear (4 pairs of fins, 4 masks, 4 snorkels, and booties) to the beach.  It is great - easy to carry, comfortable handles, has a pocket for accessories (keys, wallet, antifog goo, etc).  I don't know what to use the "Cruise" thing for - it seems like another little pouch/bag.  The bag itself is very sturdy - I had no issues or worries just stuffing our junk into it.	I would totally buy it again.
0,Great, but more for beach cruiser
0,I recently purchased a new handgun and when it came time to outfit it with a weapon light I started to purchase another Streamlight TLR 2.  While I have owned many surefire flashlights, I have never purchased an X300.  This was primarily due to the fact that I have had such good results with the Streamlight TLR weapon lights (which I have many, both with and without lasers).  I have used and abused those Streamlights for years and have never had the slightest problem, they just plain work.  All that said, I decided to give this X300 Ultra a shot on my newest addition.  So far I have been very pleased.  While it operates slightly different than the Streamlight, and has a different throw pattern, it performs flawlessly.  I would say that I prefer the activation switch on the Streamlight better.........however, I am sure that is simply due to what I am used to.  Muscle memory and such.  All in all, I am very pleased with the Surefire X300 and I am glad that I decided to purchase it.  That said, I would question those that say the Surefire X300 it is lightyears ahead of the Streamlight.  I think they are both fantastic weapon lights and you would not go wrong with either choice.  I will update this review if anything changes on the performance.
0,The Saris Hottie Bike Stand is very easy to assemble. There are minimal parts involved. The holes drilled in the parts for screws were very accurately placed, making assembly a snap. As with all Saris products I've owned, it is built with very high quality parts and is aesthetically pleasing enough to use indoors without being ashamed for it to be seen. The only difficulty I had in assembly was installing the lower bike supports in the mid-position, which actually straddles the upper and lower sections of the rack. I wasn't that surprised that I needed to use a plastic mallet to settle the supports into place. All other pieces were very easily installed. The rack is very substantial and I would have no reservations about the security of it's ability to hold two bikes when on level ground. The rack comes with one shelf that will hold several accessories including helmets in the special slots made for the clasp to slide into. The current price tag certainly would make one pause, but in my opinion, if you invest a significant amount of money in a good quality bike, you probably wouldn't mind investing in a good quality rack to securely hold your bike.
0,No miss feeds. Working great. Can't find it.
0,Just used it for my first bike ride to the yoga studio.  I am pleased with it.		PROS:	- Holds the mat securely and centered	- Plenty of room and storage	- Not too big and not too small	- Camo pattern is sweet	- Materials seem decent	- Price wasn't too bad		CONS:	- The cell phone holder is crappy and I immediately removed it	- The zippers are a little wonky and on the cheap side		Overall I would recommend the Yoga Sak, especially if you bike to class.  With a few minor improvements, this bag could be incredible.  The PROS certainly outweigh the CONS though.
0,Excellent product.  Would buy again.
0,Good shirt - fits and looks good.
0,I received the ball the day of or day before they estimated which was great. The ball was very good. Well padded, low bounce as it should be and in great condition. I played a few games on basketball courts and hockey rinks and playing with was fun. The ball isn't so sticky where it gets caught under your foot when you dribble and isn't so smooth that you loose the ball as soon as you touch it. Overall good ball. Wished I had it longer but it got popped on a fence at a hockey rink because apparently some people don't know how to kick a ball playing street soccer.
0,I love this stuff and not just for forks. It's long lasting, makes for a great water seal as well. Also works great for wheelbuilding to lube nipple seats. I find that it is very strong and isn't easily displaced by loads. I squeeze this into a clear jar for long term use.
0,nice reel  looks unused but inner plastic bag was opened and parts scattered thru box  but seems to be all good otherwise
0,Get ready for sore abs. Great workout tool.
0,Excellent quality instrument.
0,BEST ON MARKET
0,good helper
0,My son loves this belt very good purchase
0,We bought two sets of these for our 9-year-old nephew for Christmas.  I have never seen him so excited about a gift.  He was so impressed that he now had REAL handcuffs (he thought he would be getting toy handcuffs).  Him and his buddies will have lots of fun playing cops with these!
0,Only reason I gave it a "4" is because the bracket is not stainless, it's painted steel.  Other than that, these are very bright.  They have a good spread and bright light.  Added to the front and back of my T-top on my center console.  Very happy with the light output.
0,Only used once but so far good product.  I got size large for wide ppl.  I'm 5 10 at 200 pds. Fits perfect.. Able to move with out restraint amd restrictions.
0,Items just as described and works great
0,They arrived fast and don't smell bad.  I should have payed more attention at check out because I thought I had bought 2 of the 5 pound weights and instead I bought 2 of the 2.5 pounds weights.  I'm still happy with the quality and product.  Next month I'll buy the right set.
0,Very nice glove. Will be easy to break in.
0,This product is an essential for disaster preparation kits and would be an excellent tool for those who are back-country hiking and camping, or for anyone traveling in any areas where drinkable water is difficult to find. Eliminating 99.9% of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, the LifeStraw Mission High Volume (5L) Gravity fed water purifier is an excellent product and well worth the money.		The product has several components.		1. Roll Bag - Where you put the water you want to filter prior to filtration. It holds 5L of 'dirty' water.		2. Shoulder Strap - Attaches to the Roll Bag for carrying the heavy 'filled' bag.		3. Stuff Sack - Where you can place all the components when not in use.		4. Pre-Filter - Inside the Roll Bag; this is what gets the big particles out of the water prior to finer filtration.		5. Hose - Takes water from Roll Bag to filter.		6. Blue Safe Water Tap -  The filtration device that has both a Blue "Safe" water outlet and a Backwash "Red Water - do not drink" outlet.		7. (4) extra pre-filter mesh inserts - to be replaced as needed.		--------------------------------------		Made in Switzerland, this product purifies up to 18,000 Liters (4755) gallons of water at the rate of 9 to 12 Liters (2.4 - 3.2 gallons) per hour.  It requires no running water or electricity to operate. It is about 18" long and weighs less than 1 pound when water is not in it, and thus it's easy to transport to any area.		Instructions for this product are simple and easy to follow. Water from my local river had visible debris (vegetation, sediment) but after filtration was clear with no 'fishy' smell or strange taste. The hardest part about using his product was collecting the water and remembering to not drink from the Red Water tap.		An alternative to this sized LifeStraw product would be individual LifeStraws for each member of your family.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/LifeStraw-Personal-Water-Filter/dp/B006QF3TW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">LifeStraw Personal Water Filter</a>&nbsp;which would be more cost effective for fewer people who are using the products while camping or similar.		I am very happy to have this product in my home disaster kit and am recommending it to others.		------------------------------------------------------		NOTE:  I received this product from LifeStraw and was asked to provide an honest review.		Purchasing ANY LifeStraw product means you will be helping a child in Africa to be provided with safe drinking water for a full school year.

0,Fabulous for strengthening my grip.  My hand physical therapist recommended this type and it has continued to be a daily exercise to keep up my hand strength.
0,quick link makes cleaning the chain a lot easier
0,My 6 year old is in gymnastics. Wanted to practice bar work at home. Perfect solution. She loves it.
0,Great Product
0,For the price you cannot beat this.  It is a very solid, well designed piece of equipment that is very stable. I weigh 250  at 6 foot tall and when I put my full weight on that pull up bar, the rack does not wobble at all.  Also, you can build it up by creating a base using lumber, it has flanges on the bottom so you can put some lag bolts into some 2x6's or plywood etc... to raise the height. It works fantastic, and like I said, for 89 bucks?  this thing is WELL worth it.  Sure, you can get better ones if you want to spend the cash, but this works just fine for me.  Frankly, you get far more than what you pay for with this.  A refreshing change when it comes to exercise equipment I'd say.
0,After using it, I have to say it is a great product. It is more expensive than some much bigger floor pump at our local department store, but I think it is worth the money. Very compact design but very sturdy, different from other fragile frame-mount pumps. Also very easy to pump with little strength. Overall great product, strongly recommend.
0,havent had a chance to take them out to sight in yet but they seem well made bit on the large side but should still work fine
0,I was skeptical at first, but I like it! It is a great item for cleaning chains on the bike while not making a huge mess!		I prefer removing them and using a solvent tank, but not always do I want to push in a new pin into a chain if it has no quick-link.		I use watered down Simple Green and it works great while not getting the bikes wet and dirty. I change the fluid twice and then wipe dry and re-lube. Saves a ton of time!
0,This is a great poncho liner Blanket! Gotta love the Woobie! It seems a bit larger than the old woodland camo pancho liner, but this thing is awesome! Authentic issue, Multicam, and brand new, so no worrying about the condition it is in. It is soft, and pretty fluffy for the batting. These are not really heavy, but they are pretty warm. You can use it as a light blanket while camping, or put it under your sleeping bag for some extra padding and insulation. It has the little ties on the corners too to help secure it in place during use. This is a great value, and I would buy another one.
0,Essential tool for changing fore end on an 870 Remington 12 or 16 gauge shotgun. Not many parts will inter-change between the two but fore ends and butt stocks, as well as extended magazines will. This tool makes removing and replacing the fore end possible. Stop buggering up the castle nut with screw drivers that don't let you torque down the nut correctly. Buy this tool!
0,Oddly, for the past three years I've been calling them the wrong name! I kept calling them the Utili-Mitt.  They have many uses and I thought utility was a good descriptor, but ulti(mate) is also a fitting descriptor.  Over the last 3 years I've worn them quite a bit in a variety of conditions, including below zero temps and windchill up into the 40's.
0,High quality, thick, tough  tire for my Trek 750. Haven't put many miles on yet, so durability remains to be seen.
0,When we ordered this through Vine, the listing said SML - so I thought it was one size. We received the item and it was marked S/M. My husband is typically a 35 waist so while he could get this on, it was just too small. That said, he said if it had fit, he would have loved it. It was well made and stretched easily to put on while still offering significant compression without feeling painfully tight.
0,I really love this workout!! I am losing weight and feeling great!!  Shaun T. is very encouraging, and this workout is really fun!!  I love how I am exercising and dancing at the same time.  I think anyone can do this workout if you put your mind to it, and you can do it at your own pace.  I intend to keep it up because I am noticing the results and my family and friends do too!!
0,Got this in preparation for halloween. Wanted to see if it fit over glasses. Does for me. Only issue is the foam inserts inside you better plan on a bit of gorilla glue and a sandbag to hold them down while the glue dries.
0,Serves it's purpose and has a good feel. I love it!
0,all good
0,very nice & great price.
0,good product
0,This holster is fantastic.	I didn't have any issue whatsoever with the retention. Right out of the box it was perfect, durable and well made.	I did take a spot of sandpaper and sand a few edges - Maybe took me 30 seconds. I am really not sure why that's an issue for some reviews.	It absolutely works as advertised.
0,Purchased this gun for my 9 yr old to use in backyard. Seems to be a  good gun so far. We've had the gun approximately 7 months and still works fine. pump action works well and gun is accurate from approximately 50 feet. I wasn't a big fan of the scope though. Seems to be just a novelty item, when attached, is not very accurate. My soon likes the look of the gun with the scope, but I prefer to use the gun without. Overall, great gun for the price.
0,Wear it sometimes twice a day when walking dogs.  Easy to put on, easy to adjust, no drama.  Can imagine it would adjust to everyone within reason.
0,Great little stakes for putting up a Volleyball net.
0,Just what I needed the price was good and it came quickly.
0,Seller made sure my product was intact and speedily delivered item. The product is amazing and has really invigorated my motivation to practice everyday! I truly see and feel a difference in my practice using this wheel. I suggest it for beginners and experts alike.
0,Many people knock mtech for being cheap but I bought this knifeabout 7 years ago and used it semi regularly and quite roughly. As long as you keep it well oiled, it deployes as good as many of my much more expensive knives. The only lyrics reason I bought another one is because I let my brother borrow it and he lost it. ( he loved it too)
0,Good product, tablets, it works, top materials, made to last,  I think a product like this will solve world peace
0,This is a must have item that will sure make it easy to load up the 22LR magazines.	This is sooooo easy to use that even a DEMOCRAP can use it properly.	I have two of these for my Ruger and Victory and one that is a different size for my Colt 1911 Govt. 22LR.	I really love these.
0,These are excellent and thin. They save my back when I'm sitting in the car for hours.
0,Seems well made besides the molle being slightly off center.  Has a very nice liner inside that I wasn't expecting.  It's too big for my canteen.  Maybe I have the wrong size canteen but it sags pretty bad from my backpack.
0,The quality is very good. The reeling is very smooth.		I purchased this for my daughter as a gift. So I will update my review when she gets more time to use it
0,This knife clip was a great purchase and is a great way a carry a fixed blade knife. This very easily concealed with a smaller fixed knife
0,the team used sharpies to write on these, similar to a yearbook. turned out very well and they still have them years later.
0,I use these to cover my wrist tattoo when I have to for work. They're a little longer than I'd like but they get the job done.
0,Great quality but the wrist straps are a bit thin material wise.  Color does not always match picture from site.
0,Cheap and adequate.
0,A present for my grandson...he absolutely loves it.  It's comfortable and easy to use.
0,Super light and perfect on the trail.  Save some money by buying it here.  You'll pay almost 50% more at REI or GanderMT
0,Researched quite a bit before ordering these shifters for my wife's Trek 6000 mountain bike.  The old shifters were extremely weathered/aged and were frequently failing to shift.  I am no bike maintenance pro but I am pretty handy and own two bicycle repair books that I bought here at AMAZON a few years ago - so I figured I could do the replacement myself and save a hundred bucks from the bike repair shop.  I have enough experience with shifters to know that Shimano shifters likely won't match with SRAM derailleurs but fortunately this bike has a complete Shimano component drivetrain.  For safety's sake, I posted the compatibility question on a bike repair forum and received a couple answers confirming that these shifters would fit with the other components.  The bike is a 3 x 8 setup with the front derailleur being Shimano Acera, and the rear is Shimano Deolre LX.		I am happy to confirm that the Shimano ST-EF65 Shift/Brake Set did indeed match right up and the bike is now shifting smoothly.  Installation was a breeze.  The cables that came with the set had slightly different housing lengths than the originals on the bike, but may not be so on every application.  Regardless, cables are cheap and your bike shop can hook you up with the right housing lengths.		Good luck and happy biking.
0,works ;good in gun
0,Although its a bit much for one person to carry. I took this on my AT thru-hike in the beginning and ended up leaving it in a hiker box over a month later and buying a medium-sized replacement can. Rule of thumb is the small cans last you about a week for one person. Medium cans about 2.5 weeks. Large can was still going after over a month of daily use. Estimates based on making a cup of coffee in the morning and boiling water for dinner at night.
0,Not as good as some others I have that were about the same price, but good none the less.
0,Like some reviewers said, this tie-down is extremely easy to use.  It's very easy to adjust to the right tension, much easier than the previous tie-down straps I had been using.
0,Great for my 5 year olds beginning lacrosse class
0,Surprisingly comfortable for the size and price. I own a few budget and custom made hammocks. This is one of the most comfortable. The weight of the hammock makes it perfect for backpacking.
0,I catch my 13 year old working on pitching.  It was starting to hurt. This has padding just where you need it and your hand fits nicely inside a glove with it on.  The padding is think enough to reduce the sting to almost nothing.		It reduces the feel of the ball going into the glove quite a bit, so I wouldn't advise wearing it in a game, but it's great for bullpen sessions/practice.
0,One week into wearing these and so far no signs of wear or breakdown. They appear to be well made, be sure to wear longer socks and fold them down to give you some padding around the ankles. This will help prevent them from shifting around or rubbing against your skin.
0,I love it
0,I had the boil the sheath to get it soft enough to stretch the strap enough to snap.  After a couple boils and stretches it works.  However, the sheath is a little short.  The blade touches to stitching on the front and has cut them.  If you push the sheath back the blade will poke through just a little.  If the overall length were another inch longer it would be perfect.  The snap would be far enough back and the blade would not cut the front stitches.
0,Purchased as a replacement for my 12 year old son's old (destroyed) watch.  Good size and readability, pretty rugged.  Would purchase again.
0,For the price, this gives great value. Normally I see chalk and the bags sold separately and for what would be double the price.		Nothing to say about the chalk ball itself except that it works as expected and will probably last a long time. Compared to loose chalk, chalk in ball form is not as wasteful and won't generate annoying chalk clouds.		The bag looks and feels nice. Mine doesn't actually stand up by itself all the time (have to fiddle with the bag shape), but that's not a big deal to me. I use this for bouldering right now. Sometimes I just keep the bag in the the gym cubby and go back to it from time to time to get more chalk. It does come with a clip that I can use to wear around my waist, and the strap is adjustible as well, so that's also an option if you're not wearing a harness or something else you can clip the bag to.		The side of the bag has a separate compartment for keeping phones, keys, etc, although I don't really use that since I have a separate gym bag, but it is great to have as an option.		I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
0,works well, just what I needed

0,I only wish I had this mat the first few times I field stripped my Glock 17. It ingeniously puts step by step diagrams on the cleaning mat that show how to break down the popular Glock handgun. It rolls flat for use or small for storage. It has a magnetic parts holding area, which are raised plastic trays for parts. It is the perfect mat for all Glock users. What more can I say?	Highly recommended.
0,I love this hat.  I got it for my husband.  Great Quality.  I will order from them again.
0,I so happy to see that someone has finally made compression socks that are fun looking!  I'm going to buy more.

0,Nothing better then Uggs in the winter
0,Positively surprised! Works as described :-)
0,Good soccer nets for my soccer obsessed 10 year old. They have held up for 4 months in the outside without showing any signs of rust. They take about a half hour to assemble - doable by one person but easier with two. They worked so well that we recommended them to my son's elementary school to put out in their fields (paid for by a cash poor parent's association that would not be able to afford more expensive nets).
0,In case you were looking for a... case for your Mosin's (or other rifles) take to the range, I noticed some people have trouble finding ones that will fit.		Here I have an m91 and an m39 with lots of ammo and targets with room to spare.  They don't move around or bump each other either.  I have gotten 2 m91's in there plenty of times.  Another time I have a massive VEPR54r, a Kel-Tec SU-16c, 2 pistols, and 3 mags for each gun in there no problem.		The foam inside won't melt or stick to your rifle, even after a 5-Pmag dump with an SU-16c.		Extremely cheap, sturdy, and arrives fast!
0,I have had many cooler bags, living in SW Florida, you tend to go thru coolers often.  I have never had any luck with bag coolers, they always tear. This one is made very sturdy on the outside, the inside lining appears to be thicker then others.  The cooler is not very big, I could not use this for a trip to the beach for a family of four, with food and enough beverages for s day. But it had been perfect for over-night stays in hotels or car trips. It easily packs into trunk or luggage. Over all I am very satisfied. I was given discount for my honest review, that said, I would recommend this cooler, but I also believe it is priced high- but you do get what you pay for, and I think this cooler was built to last.  So, for me it is a keeper.  This is one item that I bought, and now find myself using often.  Love having it in car trunk for road trips, no more stops for cold drinks, that only get drank half way, then discarded- drinks go back in cooler to stay cold and then drank and finished later!
0,Quality!
0,just as advertised
0,my great granddaughter loves this little scooter - age 2 birthday gift.  Light weight, easy balance.  Very good value.
0,It is pretty good, and it is big! If you have a really big mat, is it perfect. I have a manduka pro and fits very nicely, with plenty of room for water bottles, towels, keys, etc. Some reviewers complaint about the shoulder strap hurting their shoulders. I don't understand why since there is a padded part that you can move around to whatever position you are carrying the bag. Also have a strap on each end so you can reach it very easily. Very sturdy, I keep it on my car trunk and does not get dirty (I carry flowers and gardening supplies every now and then, so my car trunk is not very impeccable lol)
0,Got this for my husband because he said he was the only one who didn't have any Under Armour. He really likes it and wears it all the time. Very nice material and super comfy.
0,i don't even own a name brand camelbak. i bought the walmart brand one and this fits perfectly into the drinking tube. i use this thing on stage while i'm wearing a mask, and i'm able to drink through it while it sits IN my mask with the rest of my noggin.
0,good product and seller.  thank you
0,I bought these due to the good reviews.  Love them and will be getting more for when it gets cooler.
0,Best sight ever! took me six arrows and I was sighted in. It doesn't match the lost camo pattern but who cares it's a great sight. I harvested 2 bucks and a doe with it this year after not bow hunting for 15 years.
0,Returned for 1/2 size smaller.
0,Good
0,Fantastic bottle! No sweating. Only used for cold water...tastes very fresh after all day. I drive many miles a day.... love this beverage vessel. =).
0,I was alittle cautious before buying this mount but I'm glad I did, holds tight, and I like the quick release option. Haven't shot a whole lot of rounds with it yet but have high hopes that it will stay solid.
0,fit our soul great but is also adjustable to fit probably almost any vehicle.  holds the big bikes well but bikes with larger frames such as the feminine bikes don't fit in the slots perfectly but you can still tighten them down to work.
0,I bought this for my husband for his mountain bike, and all his tools fit in easily plus it expands to fit his wallet and his keys if needed without looking bulky.
0,Love these! They get very hot very quick ( had to put a towel between myself and them). I used the larger ones for my back and they did wonders to it! About 2 hours of use out of them. I'd recommend them to any of my friends.
0,For the price, this reel is amazing!  I can't say enough about this little reel  (C30)  I have hung up the Stradics and been using this beauty all winter for surf perch.  It's light, casts smooth and casts far.  I paired it up with a 9'6" light Lamiglas and am having so much fun with it.  Even if it lasts one or two seasons I can own 5 for the price of a nice upper tier reel.  I am so happy I stumbled across this little gem.
0,Solid all purpose locking biner.  I bought them for setting up anchors as well as for belay.  Works great, the ratings are clearly marked, and the screw gate is easy to operate.  What else can you say, it is up for just about anything you want to use it for.  While I do have some specialty carabiners, this guy easily makes up the bulk of my collection.
0,Love it! Does what you want it to.
0,Purchased this too cut down on weight and of an older larger filter. Comes with everything you need. Suggest purchasing extra raw water bags they come in different sizes. You will also need a clean container to hold your filtered water. You will need to know how to practice propper water management so you don't cross contaminate your water cooking containers. I recomend pre filtering water with mud or silt that might clog your filter.
0,This bag was purchased mainly because of customer reviews, especially Donald who wrote you would be an idiot if you don't buy this.  The Golf bag is huge I'm 5'4" and upright it comes up to my chin, I even tried getting inside it, which I couldn't do it if were a suite case.		The shoe bag and small duffel will be very well used.  The quality is good, I love the shoe bag which I have already used for carrying my new golf shoes.  I am happy with the price I have paid for it, as it is Samsonite and it goes well with the rest of my Samsonite luggage.
0,Nice Holster.
0,I am a photographer who spends a great deal of time in a photo studio photographing people's pets....  cats,dogs, iguanas, hamsters, you name it.  I also photograph dogs and cats in the studio for local animal organizations.  What all this means is that I spend an inordinate amount of studio time sitting on the floor.  The hard, wood floor.  And anyone over 40 who has spent any length of time sitting on hard floors can tell you that your back, your hips and your knees take a real hit when left in this position for any length of time.  I would shoot in the studio and then spend the next couple of days trying to get my back and hips back into working order.  So it was that a couple of months ago I saw one of these chairs for the first time and I purchased it.  It made an immediate difference in how I felt the day after a studio photo shoot.		So don't you know that a month after I purchased that seat, this company writes and offers me their version of the stadium seat free of charge for the purpose of reviewing.  Well hell yes, I already knew that I liked it and if this one was anything like the other one I was going to love it and the fact is that I do.  There is great support and I love the different options for positions.  You can also set it up without the armrests.  I find the most comfortable position to be the last stop before it goes to a 90 degree angle.  This gives me good back support without requiring me to be super erect.  This one is well padded (so was the other one) and all around seems to be of quality materials and workmanship.		Here is my issue with this....  It is really large.  While that is what makes it very comfortable it also makes it a bit impractical for bringing to some stadiums and this is sold as a stadium chair.  If I am schlepping off to a stadium I am not so sure I want this on my back.  I think about going to the us open tennis matches and I think this is going to be too large for the space they allot for individual seating.  But you need to know the venue you would be bringing this to.  If it can handle this wide load then this would be a fantastic seat to bring along.  I just think one of the smaller sized versions would be more practical.  So I debated four or five stars.  This is a FABULOUS chair.  Super comfortable and well made.  It just might be too wide for many of the places you want to bring it.		BOTTOM LINE: outstanding seating alternative to hard back breaking bleachers.  My ONLY issue with this seat is that it might be too large (too wide, actually) for some venues.  There are smaller sized versions of this.  But if your venue can handle this width then you are looking at a clear five star super comfy stadium chair.  I use mine in a photo studio so I find it perfect and wonderfully back saving
0,Built like a tank and works well.
0,Works fine
0,I have almost every gymboss timer that they have. Now I can use this band verses my clothes when I work out because I sweat buckets!!! When sweat gets in the timer, it stops working properly until it air dries. A must buy!
0,Or is it, glass tastes like nothing? :) Had one (with the circles instead of the honey combed) for several years. Got it at Nordstrom for $20 actually. Have seen them at Whole Foods as well for $20. Mine went through the dishwasher 100's of times, I dropped it on the pavement over the years repeatedly and it never broke or even cracked, it was bullet-proof. That is until I left it full on the backseat of my car in the middle of winter where it froze solid and broke. Buying this one as a replacement as these are the best water bottles out there.
0,I bought a pair of these from another reseller in XL, which is the size I normally wear in many other brands. They were wearable, but too small to be comfortable and so I bought these in XXL. They fit me like an XL should. I love the features. The belt is a great addition and the styling is great. The chamois is very comfortable and several of my riding buddies have asked me about them. I recommend these but get a size larger than you normally wear.
0,My bag has been through absolute ABUSE and it's STILL intact! Other than a ripping zipper on the very front, it's all intact! I've thrown it down cliff sides, dragged it against rock, thrown it in rivers and it's all been money well spent! Tenton is fairly priced and I love their products!
0,holds my dirt bike nicely!
0,Bought these for my son and he loves playing catch with them!  Great product!
0,worked as expected.
0,This is a good little pouch for just the essentials on short and/or local-to-you rides. It's small. Really small. You can fit a 700x25 innertube in there with some effort, but that's about it. I used this for MTB with tubeless tires. It fits my Co2 inflator, two cartridges, a multitool, some extra chain links and a patch kit along with $20. That's about the extent of what fits in there, but if I'm not going all that far it's just about all I hope to ever need.		I knocked off a star because the velcro itself is a little on the weak side, and some extra way to secure it to the seat would have been nice. I'll probably try to either get clever with zip ties, or add a second set of straps to it. All in all worth the money for what it is, just be aware going in that this isn't going to be a good all-day ride pack.
0,I had purchased this oil to take care of my old 760 pellet gun and my new Ruger Black Hawk Pellet Gun. Shipping was very fast, the oil is in a nice container for easy application.		The seals were wore out in my Crosman 760 pellet/bb gun, so bad it wouldn't hold air, I had placed some of this oil on the seals and in end of the barrel over night, the gun pumped up as it did when I was a kid.  I will be keeping this product in stock, for my old and new air rifle gun needs.  I trust this seller, will gladly buy from in the future, thank you.
0,Exactly like a 'real' shower!  We intend to use it in our 5th wheel shower recess as we always have a camp fire with a water bucket over it so the Helio shower can be filled from that, not using our on board drinking water tank & no gas to heat it either as we always free camp so all good for us & I'm sure when our friends see it this season they will want one too.
0,Great
0,Great knife. Not much you can say. Seems durable and well built. I don't use it regularly, only on an as-needed basis. Con: I had trouble figuring out there is a lock on the back side of the knife. Until I figured out how that worked, I could not open the knife, which left me frustrated I bought a knife I could not open. There were no instructions about this locking feature.
0,Maybe its premature to write this - I haven't yet taken any game with these broadheads (next week I'm going to try them on turkeys). But its build quality is great, and it flies pretty much like my 150gr field points. Mine were all very sharp out of the package. I am guessing that these will be devastating on large game. The heavier weight helps with forward-of-center balance for my 16.5" bolts - making for a stable flight.		There are not many 150gr options, and in my opinion, these are the best.		Update: Used a bolt cutter last weekend to take an awesome gobbler on opening day for Spring turkey/archery. The bolt flew like it had a field point and I got an easy pass through, and a big turkey to take home. Great broadheads. Very happy.
0,Another great add on for my Lucid HD-7 Red dot! This really makes a difference!! A good price as well!
0,So far it is working as expected and pick the golf balls up well.
0,By far the best reel for the price. I have used all brands from Abu Garcia to Quantum to Shimano. Before trying this reel, my go to reels were the Curado. After this reel, I will only buy from 13 Fishing. The casts were smooth and long. Drag was easily set and powerful. The 18 lbs drag is very, very impressive. It was a dream to cast and retrieve and when the fish were on it never missed a beat. I test a lot of equipment and this one will be my new go to work horse. I can't say enough about this real. Also, the flat grey is very sexy and sleek. If you are in the market for a new reel, you won't be sorry by purchasing this reel.
0,I looked through lots of reviews before purchasing this table deciding that for the price and control it was one the best options.  I can definitely say I wasn't disappointed.  The instructions were decent and I had the table together in about 30 minutes.  The packaging was okay.  One of the blue end caps (aesthetic only) was badly cracked and basically unusable or repairable.  Also a small plastic cover to the adjustable ankle holder was broken (aesthetic only).  I used the tools provided for about a minute then broke out a cheap Walmart set of sockets and wrenches which went much better.  You have to do some flipping back and forth from the front of the manual to identify the correct bolts or screw but it wasn't hard by any means.  I do remeber having to switch the location of the bolts that hold the back rest onto the frame.  There were two long bolts and two slightly shorter bolts which worked better in the opposite locations.  They were the same size just different lenghts and to get the washers and have enough thread to place the nuts they needed to be switched.		Operation of the table:	Operation is very simple.  Adjust the bar which has the ankle supports to the well marked height increment, tighten down, and strap yourself in.  The racheting system or whatever it is, isn't the best design in the world.  There are times when I fight to get it tighter around my ankles but works alright.  The tilting actions is smooth and I love the locking adjustment options as well as the easy of movement with the aid of the handles.		Biggest complaint:	I weight about 270lbs and to do a full inversion is more pain than I can bear.  At near or full inversion the position of my foot and ankle are less than enjoyable and it feels like my ankle is literally about to rip apart.		All in all:	There is room for improvement but this is a very good table.
0,Fine pedals.
0,Well made, will do the job. If your looking for something different in an edged weapon this is a good choice.
0,replaced old lead core.  good product
0,Bought this line for the first time about 6 months ago from a local "Very Talented Bass Fisherman" that happened to open a bait shop.  Couldn't believe how expensive it is just for a filler spool but was having problems with other flourocarbon lines in the 16-17 lb class breaking just when trying to tie a knot...no brand names here!  Couldn't believe how sensitive and yet strong the 16 lb was and it casted like 10 lb line.  Used on my worm rig until I had broke off enough to need to respool.  The bigger spool allows for less waste in the end because the 200 yard spool leaves a bunch of unusable each time you reline.
0,Love using this and is my favorite part of the summer, breaking this out. Even my buddy has used this and he is 6 foot 10 inches and 400 pounds.
0,My wife had foot surgery and had to use a knee walker for three month's while recovering and continuing to work.  This was a priceless accessory in helping her carry her belongings throughout the day.  Takes only seconds to put on and take off as needed.
0,Love it so much I ordered a second one for a spear
0,Nice set. Looks very trendy and makes me 3 year old happy... Gloves will be falling apart with several uses but by that time the kid will move on to something else. Overall good buy.
0,Love love love this bad, it is a durable canvas bag with a heavy duty zipper. I ordered a large yoga mat and it fits perfect! The pocket is big and easy to get to. Great design as well!
0,I found this tool to be ver helpful when playing golf, I went to hit a few galls on the course and wanted to try it out. At first I was a bit hesitant on how to use it. But the simple directions guided me through it all. People asked me what was that, I said I am trying to better my swing. So now I am going to keep trying so I can enter a few charity events for fun and at least beat my friends. Overall great tool Will work also well on a putting range as well.

This unit allows for pretty simple targeting and quickly reads and relays that information.		The LCD is very clear and easy to see (even in dark areas). The unit is a great size for portability and tolerates weather so carrying it around shouldn't be an issue.		Adjustments are simple and the it is very simple to locate the intended target.		It powers itself off so you never have to worry about forgetting to turn it off between uses.		I've never owned a unit like this but I can see it having uses beyond the golf course.		Battery, lanyard, case with belt loop are all included.		Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.
0,Great set and great dry snorkel.	Would buy again.
0,I am not sure why Trijicon does not supply caps with their scopes. I bought these and they fit well on the Trijicon ACOG 4x1. The material is similar to innertube rubber. Simple, stretchy bands keep them in place. Simple is good.
0,Great price for prescription goggles. Different size bridge pieces for a custom fit.
0,Great
0,Good little First Aid Kit that is convent in size and has extra room to add a couple things to fit your personnel needs. Seems to have all necessary items to address most medical emergencies for the common lea men skill person with minimal medical training. Cost was more than fair as I have purchased like kits for more $$$. Hope this helps!
0,The flashlights are indeed bright. They are "projector" style.		The only thing I really needed was the mounts.  I have five similar flashlights now. All of them are just flashlights because the holders always give way.
0,I bought this for my son-in-law who LOVES golf. I bought this to use with the golf swing net. He thought this was awesome.
0,Had been doing the Les Mills PUMP workout for a few weeks with a weight bar I purchased here. It had the standard spring-loaded clamps. It was ok, but transitions between sets was slow and cumbersome. Since purchasing these, I have no issues between sets. No one has to wait around for me to get my new weight on the bar. I highly recommend them - they're fantastic!
0,Great product works as advertised
0,What's not to love it says Tennessee Titans
0,Read a few cases of random innocent people being assaulted or even killed on the streets (or just about anywhere for that matter).  I bet almost 0% of them expected it, or saw it coming.  Best to be prepared at all times!!  And this WILL stop an attacker!!!  If you don't believe me, spray a little squirt on your fingertip and gently apply it to your eyeball.. have fun!!  Or, you can carry a loaded gun at all times.  Try to get into work with it though..  Enjoy the uncomfortable bulge too!  Oh, and better remember to keep it on SAFE at ALLLLL times!!  If you ever have to use a gun, better be VERY ready to explain yourself!  I think this would even have more "stopping power" than a knife!!  Once again, if you don't believe me, try it out once.  It's only 7 bucks!..  It should also stop an attacking rabid dog as well especially considering their sense organs are much more sensitive than a humans.
0,it is what it is.
0,great knife thick came very sharp like ferro rod & sharpener nice extras knife cuts & chops very well batons good, holds sharpness.over all better then expected
0,Awesome chair
0,put on kel tec sub-2000....wayyyy better now
0,Worked good for bike packing in the sanoran desert .	I used with sleeping bag liner , to reduce bulk of the sleeping bag and weight .	I think I stayed warmer with the liner on top of , as opposed to in the Bivvy .	It did seem a little narrow , but worked ok .	It would be nice to have had a longer zipper .
0,Nice and warm id buy a size bigger than tee shirt size
0,Received and used right away. We had two very dead Razor scooters.	Charger worked perfectly.	Have had the charger for over a month and still works great.	Very happy!
0,Great value
0,An excellent bipod for a very good price. Great quality, comparable to much more expensive models. I mounted this to the sling stud for my Remington 700 .30-06; a great fit and a stable shooting base. This rifle packs a punch and this bipod remains secure through it all. Shooters with much more expensive gear are impressed with my new bipod.
0,cheap and easy to use air-soft gun.
0,Works exactly as advertised. Good stuff.
0,Bought this for my twelve year old son for his birthday he has spent hours practicing with this bow and it is great . easy to use , easy to set up I strongly recommend this for your child .
0,Bought it for my wife.  She loves it.  Well-constructed, and the padding is excellent.
0,Saves your back from unhealthy pressure during sit ups - Much heavier duty quality material than I expected
0,THIS THING IS AWESOME AND GREAT FOR ALL FISHERMEN
0,Will inflate a twin air mattress in about a 90 seconds. No batteries.
0,perfect fit for my home office. When the weather is not cooperating outside, I can walk/run inside. Folds up and stores upright next to my desk.
0,I am a life long Boy Scout.  I own two Camp Chef stoves, and I just purchased my second Camp Chef griddle.  This item is a very good addition to any Camp Chef stove, if you intend to use a griddle. Each Camp Chef stove comes with a silly, little wire basket to hold a can to catch drippings from a griddle. They are virtually useless.  In a better world, this device should be sold right along with griddle.  Since it is not, you are forced to buy it seperately.  For the benefit of those who are not experienced, drippings from a griddle are a small problem if you set up the stove and griddle on rocks or grass, but a very large problem if you set up on concrete or a deck surface.  Even in the backcountry, camping near a spot that you have soaked in griddle drippings may cause you to have uninvited guests in your campsite.
0,The best batting glove my son has used, made for the pros 10 year old killing machine
0,these are great gun socks and work great for every gun
0,Item arrived without damage and looks better than is pictured. Works great in my media room, a little pricey but is exactly what I was looking for
0,I needed tabbed socks that would prevent blisters from forming on the backs of my heels and these do the job.
0,Great product!		Easy to clear, top plastic piece goes in smooth, no leak. Mouth piece is solid, easy to think.		Love it!
0,Great bag. Id highly recommend puchasing this bag if you are looking for something to take you shooting items to the field
0,worked well after rimming
0,I wear this watch almost all of the time now.  I was switching out watches for work and working out, but recently started wearing it at work.  Love it!!
0,Does well for what it is. The pot is small though, works well with the lee spoon, but an RCBS dipper is big for it.
0,Exactly what I was looking for. It will come in handy for snow shoeing this winter! A great tool for winter hikes.
0,Functional and look great too.
0,My first 90 Degree - I have always ordered Victoria Secret yoga pants, but the price keeps going up.  These are well made and the fabric is thick enough that they should be great in gym classes.
0,Nice and shiny but not a very good golf ball. Hard as a rock and the outside scuffs easily. Put them on my collection rack.
0,Lightweight, Great fit, Very durable. Good polarized lenses to filter out the suns brightness..	comes with a nice hard carry case.. very well made glasses
0,excellent for my Mosin
0,Love these bikes, easy to install, no hassle. Highly recommended!
0,Great bench for the cost.		It is a bit wobbly but it could be my basement floors.	I am 5'9 and yes my head goes above the rest but honestly it doesn't bother me at all.		By far my favorite portable bench for free weights.	The only thing I wish it had a better option for preacher curls.
0,great if you're in Antarctica a bit much for everywhere else
0,Used these on a recent trip to Puerto Rico, and shot my best rounds in a long time.  Longer drives, better around the greens.  Going to try these back home in reality!
0,Foam roller is great for deep muscle massage. I bought the 12" one and I think it's perfect for slim build. I use it after work to help relax muscles.
0,The best
0,These were definitely more purple than gray. They are amazing for everything from bikram to boot camp. I have NO butt or hips and larger thighs and they stay up wonderfully. The waistband does roll every now and then but it's very rare.	I'm 5'6", 27" waist, around 135 lbs and a small hits around the mid calf on me.
0,Well made and easy to install. I did the research and determined this type to be the best and most accurate. To know how much fuel you have is important, this sending unit does the job.
0,HAPPY
0,Best pair ever perfect fit, wished I had bought more
0,A six-foot mat makes it great for small places when you want to practice your putting.  Although, the hole can only hold two balls, its still good practice.  It also rolls up to fit in a small box that you can carry anywhere.  For the price, I think its worth it.  I just have to keep my cat away from the balls!
0,The holster works great with the weapons I am going to use with it, going to order the left hand holster as well.
0,Good quality product
0,These bands are super! Easy to change and and a variety of colors to chose from
0,excelent
0,I have used Shimano equipment as long as I can remember since they were available  The Sedona FD is a medium priced reel I use for Bass.  Very smooth and dependable.  The only problem I have is the bail never seems to line up where I want?  There is no "play" in it which is good for setting the hook, but it's something I will have to get used to.  Using the switch button will solve the problem.  Shimano has incorporated this feature in many of their reels.  For the money this is a great reel.
0,the best i have used
0,Great knife
0,I hate to admit that I am out of shape and a few months back, I noticed that my shoulders and upper back was hurting. I remembered years ago going to physical therapy and they had some exercise bands and showed me how to use them for my shoulder and upper back. Just some simple stretching exercise that could help with the muscles. When I saw the Original Exercise Bands, I knew I need these.	What I love the most about these is right on the band is an exercise to use with that band or you can use a different band for the same exercise. I also love the texture of these bands, they feel well made and that they won't break or stretch out of shape. I have tried them a few times and I can feel the results and am hoping this will help me with stretching and building some muscle strengthen back in my body. It is good to exercise and I have slacked long enough, I will be using these and trying to add other exercise to my daily routine.	This package also comes with a little pamphlet with more ways to use the Original Exercise Bands.	I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.
0,Son in law says it works great.
0,This reel is my new favorite!! Super smooth bearings and love the bite and run drag setting! For the money this is hands down the best bang for your buck!!
0,If you're looking to build a home gym without taking up much space or simply looking for a portable workout system, the Bodylastics resistance band sets are a fantastic option. The 28-piece set is my second set after buying a smaller package in 2012. I wanted to add heavier resistance bands than I already had, so I picked up the second set a few weeks ago. The design of both the clips and the bands has changed a bit since 2012 and the bands are now marked with the weight of resistance, which is a nice upgrade from the 2012 version. I haven't had a single band break yet and it looks like Bodylastics stands behind their products with just a small shipping fee if a band breaks after 90 days. Very pleased with this purchase. If you have posts in your basement, you can wrap the extra ankle bands around the post to create various anchor points for the bands, in addition to the large and small anchors that come with some packages. Overall, a fantastic product for the price and the included workout poster has lots of ideas for various exercises.
0,Need for reloading!
0,Great item at a great price.
0,This bed is amazing! Blows up in minutes. Plug it in, set the dial and flip the switch. I do recommend getting a mattress pad, however. My guest thought it was cold to sleep on without one.
0,This is the older model with the plastic buckles and such. Works well though.  Newer model is definitely a five star item.
0,Fast delivery, good product.  thank you
0,Great Deal!!
0,Great price, fit my T-top PERFECT!
0,all better than what expected, I arrive all in perfect conditions, just the I gave that tapeworm that to arrive the things arrived
0,Nice works best with Proteus!
0,Install was easy. Made the mistake of not cleaning the grips on the edges after removing them from the sheet so I have some white paper residue that's visible on the outline but with enough use it should fall off or get dirty and blend in.
0,Good looking decoys for the price. Are a bit smaller but when you mix them in with some oversized decoys they do great. Adds a little diversity. Shipping was a little slow.
0,Best bag out there. I got a Condor 3 Day Assault pack aft first, very cheaply made, I got one and it ripped, ordered another and ripped again when 3/4's full. The compression stapes are what made the cheap nylon on the inside tear at the seams. This pack though, wow! It is way better quality in every way. Compression straps are amazing. Storage is great, i like to be organized and know where everything is, this does that flawlessly. Great pack and comfy. Well done 5.11
0,Extremely modular and easy to put on quickly. Perfect for airsoft or real-world use. Very well-made and comfortable. Fits anyone with medium to large frame.
0,Been using this for years and will continue to do so -- completely eliminates any chafing for long rides.
0,Fits perfectly in my G19!
0,Goes on easy and really makes an impression when you're going down the street.  Great price.  Would be nice to have a way to screw it onto your spokes so somebody could not steal it though.
0,I like this pump.  I have read numerous one star reviews about missing the part that makes it work, but do to poor instructions, they might not have known to flip the guts in the head around to change it from a schraeder valve setup to a normal 'ol bike tube setup.  Heck I didn't even know it could be swapped, until my friend who has the same pump showed me.  But in my eye, it makes the pump better, because you can use it on both valve stem types.  As for pumping power, I only pump my 29x2 tires upto 3.5 bars before I quit and said its full enough, hehe.  If you have 9 bar racing tires, I'd recommend bringing a friend and a tall glass of ice water to cool yourself down, cause your gonna be pumping for abit.  The little footstand piece was laughable when I first opened it to fill my tire, but it actually works.  The pump is very light, and it mounted to my bike with the provided hardware with no problems.  A good little pump that needs better instructions on how to set it up.
0,Nice material for the price.
0,Nice powerful burners, quick and easy to set up. Compact and lightweight I use this in place of my Large and Heavy camp burner.
0,Took me a few tries to get them on, and they were a tight fit on my Axiom Journey. Does add some weight, but that's not a big deal for my situation.
0,My son in law hasn't taken them off since he got them from me as a gift!!
0,Awesome mount for a light or even a camera. Finally had a chance to use mine with a light this morning and it works perfectly.
0,I submitted a similar review for the SKS B45 fenders warning anyone out there who is choosing between the two models that the B45 rear fender is 5.5" shorter than the B53 rear fender. One thing I love about SKS fenders is the coverage they offer - so 5 1/2 inches is definitely something that would sway my decision. Even if the B53s are a little wide for my tires and black looks better than silver, that much difference in coverage has me voting for the B53s over the B45s.
0,product works excellent. I have ordered these before and they always work like described. I will continue to order these cartridges.
0,Good product.  Years ago, I jumped out of airplanes.  I wore French Para-boots, that used elastic boot-laces.  The problem was there was no way to tie them.  I wish now that I had the laces that I have now.
0,Quality mat. I like the symmetrical pattern so I can face either direction,.
0,Five Stars for socks... Yes.. They're that comfortable.
0,good
0,Its a neoprene hand weight. What else do you need to know? Works just fine.
0,Work great!  Just as expected..
0,Works great for towing and very visible in murky water.
0,Great workout. If you are looking to tone up with not a lot of out of breath craziness, this is for you. I mean, it's a workout but not insane cardio like insanity.
0,well made.
0,Solid platform, easy installation.  Very happy with this purchase.  Like the other reviewers mentioned, don't forget to go to Lowes and get mounting hardware.  5/16" lag bolts and washers.  NOT 5/8"... I misread the reviews and instructions and came home with these huge bolts.  Had to go back to Lowes to get the correct size.		Also, if you mount it to studs, the sound will carry throughout your house.  Mine is in the basement and it sounds like the house is about to come down everytime I hit it.  Moving it to the block wall on the other side of the room.		Last, if you're a beginner, get at large speedbag.  The medium and small bags are for more advanced practitioners.  Again, something I'm learning the hard way.  Bought a medium and it's difficult to get a direct hit on it.  So, have a large bag ordered.
0,I was at first concerned whether or not my Ruger MK3 22/45 5.5 Bull Barrel would fit based on another reviewer here. I'm glad I went through with my purchase. My 22/45 fits like a glove in this holster. The holster is very good quality, the belt clip is strong and holds well, it has a pocket for an extra mag and it looks great on the hip. Pick this up guys, you can't go wrong!
0,got as a replacement for a thirty year old gun.  these modern bands were so strong it ultimately broke the gun
0,Its a workhorse...	Heavier and thicker than I thought it'd be...its a workhorse...	If I needed a knife in the middle of nowhere, or a zombie attack...	This is a solid, solid knife...		Though in a zombie attack, I'd go with a longer blade.	But for hiking... in a world without zombies...	Avoiding bears...	This was the right length for me.
0,I really like this optic and its features. It has very clear glass, holds zero after hundreds of rounds and after being removed, and it is very solidly built. My only issue arose after taking it to the range in a sandy environment. I got a lot of dust behind the kill-flash; which normally is no big deal, just remove and clean. However, this kill-flash was on extremely tight for a little piece of aluminum. When I finally got it off, it had warped the kill-flash. Holosun took care of me though and sent me a new kill flash.
0,As an Appleseed Instructor, I spend a lot of time working a sling.  The swivels tend to be the weak link in the system.  These are solid.  Never had an issue with any of the sets I've purchased and this has to be my 5th set.
0,We have had this blanket for several years and have used it and washed it extensively and it still looks great! I often keep it in the car because it's small enough to not take up lots of room but still useful if you need a light blanket. Works great as a lap blanket or just around your shoulders. It's large enough for a child to wrap up in.
0,good product
0,Fit great, love the wide waist band thick material not see thru .... Love them !
0,Used once so far, fit perfectly and very comfortable on the seat if a bit like an adult diaper when walking around.  I would purchase this item again.
0,They come with the no slip handle which helps. They are painted with a hard enamel to help prevent rust. The handle is fatter in the center than on the outside so it fits more naturally in your grip than a standard one.
0,these are just like the ones in walmart cheaply produced but do they job
0,Great quality product!  Light and comfortable, large seating area, great height!  Worth the extra $$.
0,This little pack hold almost an entire trauma kit, of course barring the large items, but it's a great compliment to my primary BOB. The quick release Velcro allows me to pull it in an emergency and not have to hassle with the MOLLE straps. The tri-fold drop down makes sorting and access very simple. Quality of bag is above average, but only time will tell. I love it.
0,Repaired my damaged hood on my Rival lever. Worked perfectly and looks exactly like the older one....except...NEWER!
0,I bought these for my dad, a Korean War veteran who boxed in the Navy in the 50s. He hadn't worked out on a heavy bag in 30 years or so, but recently joined a gym at his advanced age. The gloves he had years ago were leather, of course, so I wasn't sure he would like these. But from all reports, they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. If they wear out, they are certainly affordable and I would buy them again.
0,My bf loves this hat for work.  The only thing I don't like is that it wears out quickly since it's already "weathered".  It survived about 6 months of washing once per week before it completely frayed on the brim (could see the plastic underneath).
0,Did its job, really happy at the Tervis I got for it!  Thought I should share :)
0,After I ordered this pack for use as a "go bag". I started to read some of the reviews to see it I'd made a mistake with my selection. I looked at the 1 and 2 stars because I was curious about the negative feedback. Well, I gotta tell ya... I've been back packing, camping and other outdoor activities literally all over the world for 40+ years now.	The negative responses couldn't be more wrong. Though this is not a high end "name brand" product it is far better than the low price belies....The nylon duck material of the pack is stronger than the views expressed would lead you to beleive. The pockets, though not big, are numerous. The shoulder straps,sternum and waist belt are well padded and have all the ajustment required.	The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the shipping took 9 days to go from Arizona to NY. In fact it took 2 days to go 2 hours up the road!!!!!! That's probably the worst I've ever had from Amazon in the 6 years I've been doing business with them....... shipped on the 3rd ... delivered on the 13th.
0,Awesome.  Got 2. One for me and hubby. We love them!  Highly recommend would definitely buy again. Just finished 1st season with them.  No problems at all
0,Used all summer - probably 15 backpacking trips and still going strong.
0,Have not used the backpack much but it seems to be of good quality with some nice options available. It will hold an iPad but anything bigger probably will not fit well.
0,good
0,One of the best holsters I've ever came across. Really nice custom fit for my Glock 42. Extremely comfortable to wear. Shipping was super fast. A+ quality. I already purchase another one for my G19!!!!
0,Comfortable earrings. Product was what I ordered
0,Bought these to use floating down the river.  The first time was a bust as our arms got pretty bruised up.  I tied these on with a string so we would not loose them.  Made the float trip a ton better.  Had a lot more fun without the work or bruising.
0,The cocking device is very simple and makes the cocking of a 180lb bow easy. A great gift to the bow hunter or target shooter.
0,Nice bipod for the price. Incredibly inexpensive for this product. Similar enough to the much, much higher priced Brand Name bipod. Mounted perfectly on my rifle.
0,Love this cap. Brought it for my husband. He loved it as well. I especially liked the fact that the colors are much different than the typical colors we have of the Miami Dolphins. Would highly recommend. Also I brought a medium by mistake and I was stressing, thinking it would fit my husband big head, but it did! Lol. So it looks like it runs big. He normally wears a large.
0,I purchased this bag to use for a dipper bag for my new daughter. It worked like a charm!! It worked so well my wife made it into her everyday purse and loves it!! Great design and very easy to organize with it. I am hoping to get it back when she gets tired of it, LOL. The only thing is I don't think it is going to happen. I purchased it before our daughter was born and she is now over two years old.  Hopefully I will be able to get another soon.
0,Great price for a set of quality pedals. Has a great grip
0,After two tries and returns, I never did get the right golf net as shown in this picture.  They kept sending the wrong ones.
0,works real well with minimal elbow grease.
0,I'd like to rate this higher, because I LOVE my Emberlit UL Stove, but the cheap case they include is shameful for a pricey stove. The stove itself is very small and lightweight. Easy to put together and the UL will be a perfect larger backpacking stove. 4" x 5.5" x 6" and about 7 oz in yer pack. By contrast the Fireant is 3 x 5 x 4 and about 4.5 oz in yer pack. This one will allow a bigger fire.		The vinyl case that comes with the stove is decent vinyl on one side but thin clear plastic on the other. Clearly that won't hold up long to a camping/backpacking trip. For the price of these fine stoves, a decent case should be included for this bigger UL. My Emberlit Fireant stove came with a nice case included. The larger UL comes with a cheap case and you have to pay $10 more to get a decent one. Booooohoooo
0,Works great. Holds pistol securely but allows a fast draw.
0,This product is great so far, took about 5 minutes to assemble and my dog loves it. It seems sturdy and well-made. My only concerns are that the tab washer does not fit my bike frame (it is too small for the tab to fit into the slot of the bicycle frame dropout slot) and the bottom of the carrier is not reinforced in any way (it is loose and flimsy on the bottom, I feel like it would tear with a medium amount of wear.
0,gd gear. fits right. well made gi for the $
0,A little tight in the crotch but big other places.  Weird cut but nice pants
0,I love these yoga mats.  They are comfortable, sturdy, and don't slip.  I love that there are many colors.  I purchased eight of these and use one almost every day.
0,Would like to see just one kind , but still will do the clean up job.
0,Great knife at an unbelievable price.  Very well made.  It is now my EDC.  Get one.  You won't go wrong.
0,These babies are amazing. I was worried they wouldn't be very tough and withstand some abuse. I use these fishing & hog hunting so trust me when I say that they can take a great amount of abuse. I'm glad I spent the extra money and got these. I would buy them again.  The seller was great to work with also.
0,These are the only pants my son will wear.  Open bottoms make them perfect.
0,This hat fits perfect and looks great. I love it. Fast delivery too.
0,better than I expected
0,I've been wearing the Gel-Nimbus for 10 years and this is the first pair that didn't fit my typical size. It feels about a half-size too small from my 16's. I'd recommend fitting the shoes in person to ensure the fit is good.
0,for hubby... he hasn't had a chance or real reason to use this but thought it was a fun gift, and it sure reflects , ok he tried it in the house...
0,Love this watch.  I had a GulfMaster and I sold it to get this instead.  Not looking back.  This is the same G-Shock durability in a very tactical and no-frills package.  Triple-sensor for barometric, altimeter, and temperature.  Solar-powered, durable, looks good....what more could you ask for?
0,Good price for the cloth and handy in your bag and to keep fingerprints off the firearm, and mild lubrication, as well
0,Bought this as a gift for a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. She seemed pleased. They have an inexpensive feel to them but they didn't cost much so I guess that's fair. I've never tried writing with them so I can't comment about how well they work.
0,Good price. Works well. Very small.
0,They look really nice however, they are very light and thin. I worry about them shattering (I say them because I bought two.) Slightly bent as well but not horribly. I like them but I wouldn't trust my life with them. They're great for managing the out of control cactus patch in my back yard. hahaha. This was after I sharpened them to a razor's edge. They do hold a fine edge pretty well too. The sheath is bleah but adequate. The grip is well... crappy, so I wrapped it with Wilson's tennis racket grip tape. For what I paid, they're great. Much better than wall hangers.
0,Very bright and compact
0,I had the 9 mm and now 380. I consider must have for reloading.
0,fits great for those who need a taller size. However, the material is on the thin-side and likely won't last as long as some Adidas clothes I've owned.
0,Works perfectly stays solid.
0,I bought these for my husband an he really likes them . Very comfortable	Keep your feet warm in the winter.
0,As a fan of yoga, my biggest frustration has always been the mat. At 6'3" tall, none of them are ever long enough--UNTIL NOW! And it's not just able to reach across my tall body doing a plank position, but it's also thick for comfort and doesn't move around when I thrust my feet forward from down dog. If you're a yoga enthusiast and sometimes get out of the moment because of the flaws in your mat, get the Gaiam Sol Sticky-Grip Yoga Mat to let those cares fall by the wayside. Namaste!
0,Very nice air pistol. It may be inexpensive, but it does a great job. Only five pumps, with a well placed shot,  and it easily terminates varmints up to large chipmunk size. More pumps for bigger game. My Model 1322  likes Crosman hollow-point pellets. If you have arthritic hands or wrists and plan to pump the 1322 between five to ten pumps, I recommend that you consider installing an aftermarket enlarged forearm and grip on the Model 1322. I salute Crosman for this very nice shooting tool. Thank you!!
0,Soooo much better than the seat that came with my bike. It really is like sitting on a cloud! When someone comes over i tell the that they have to come feel my bike seat! I would but again and recommend it to everyone!
0,Perfect for a budding skateboarder kid. Fits my 4 year old perfectly.
0,Great quality and an awesome price!!!!!!
0,Great product and NOT bulky.
0,Nice upgrade from my cheap OEM seat. Supports and feels good on my rump. I'm 6'1" 200lbs, the oem seat was too small and hard. This is much better.
0,These things are amazing! Love how they hook together! Even my 3 year old can put his scooter in it!
0,Works very well and it is noisy so at least I can hear it running and not forget and leave it on all night...  It seems to do very well
0,Good product, These shifters are very  accurate and easy to use, they also incorporate the brake handle, leaving extra room on your bars for other attachments.
0,Great with the correct expectations and if used by someone not obese or with other structural health issues (hip/joint/back problems, etc.)  It's a warm and light little sleeping pad, but it's only a pad, not a pillow top mattress!		One thing I really like about these types of pads vs the self-inflating type is that the pad can be cut to 2/3 or even 1/3 body length, and then easily lashed together if you want to make it full length again (poke holes at the cut seam, and use paracord or zip ties to temporarily lash it together again).  Makes this type of pad useful for light packing, or for full camping.		I would highly recommend this as a pad for a new hiker wanting a decently comfortable pad that is (more importantly) quite warm on those 30 something degree F nights!
0,GREAT SLING FOR MY AR
0,ok
0,Fits the Ka-Bar perfectly and holds securely, even without the handle strap.	If you have the knife, get this sheath.
0,Medium quality.	Serves my needs.
0,Two of these balls deflated in the first day of use. The other four are still holding air. But the other two were defective, I believe.
0,TESTED IT TODAY WITH THE INCLUDED INERT SPRAY CAN AND WAS IMPRESSED. I PUT MYSELF THRU A PhD WHICH TOOK MANY MANY YEARS,  PAID MY WAY THRU SCHOOL BY WORKING AS A BARTENDER, NOW, THERE IS NOTHING THAT SAYS "THIS GUY HAS ENOUGH ASH ON HIM TO COP ENOUGH ROCK FOR ALL OF US ALL NIGHT" , LIKE STANDING AT A DOWNTOWN BUS-STOP, DRESSED IN A TUX, AT 3:30 AM, I, UNFORTUNATELY HAVE HAD MANY OCCASIONS TO USE VARIOUS CS/MACE/PEPPER COMBOS AND THIS LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES, IT LOOKS GUN OR TASER LIKE TO DISSUADE AN ATTACKER FROM CHOOSING YOU TO BEGIN WITH, I ADDED A SMALL CAT-TOY LASER WITH VELCRO AND ELECTRICAL TAPE TO MINE, AFTER MODDING THE HOLSTER, AND THE LASER CAUSES YOU TO AIM NATURALLY WITHOUT HANGING UP ON CLOTHING ETC AND THE LASER BY ITSELF, HAS GREAT DETERRENT VALUE, THE GUN ITSELF IS WELL MADE AND SURPRISINGLY STURDY-ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT MAKE IT A POINT TO BE ROUGH WITH IT, THE STREAM OF SPRAY IS THICK AND HAS A LOT O F VOLUME PER DISCHARGE, SO IT WILL STOP WHATEVER YOU SHOOT, AND IT LASTS MORE THAN LONG ENOUGH TO CORRECT AIM, DURING N IMPERFECT SHOT, WITHOUT INTERRUPTING THE SPRAY, I LOST COUNT, BUT I GOT QUITE A FEW LONG DISCHARGE SHOTS WITH IT AND IT REACHED THE ADVERTISED 20 FEET WITH EASE, I WILL FEEL VERY SAFE CARRYING THIS WITH ME WHEREVER I GO, AND THE RANGE, AND EASE OF RELOADING MAKES IT A GREAT BEAR SPRAY THAT COMES TO HAND EASILY AND POINTS NATURALLY. 5 STARS
0,Will be a great gift, Look fine for the price......Well as good as anything with a Raiders logo can look.
0,works
0,This is a good wrap. My complaints are: It is difficult to figure out how to put it on like shown in the picture. Also, it hold heat for a maximum of 20 minutes -- a little minimal I thought.
0,Pro: works as advertised.	  works well with the heart rate monitor to track heart rate pretty accurately.	  Pairs well with my Iphone to alert me when I have messages or calls. I can read my messages through the watch!	  Comes with an app that helps to track my workouts and progress (and its free!)	  Water proof	  Slim profile, stylish. I have very small wrists and I love how this doesn't look overwhelmingly bulky. I can wear a dress or any non-athletic outfit and not feel like I have to remove the device.		Cons: It takes a little bit to sync my latest workout with the app.	  The alert saying you need to move can get annoying after a while specially if you are in a situation where you can't just get up and walk around.	  Display started to go bad after a few months... (Garmin is going to replace the device for me free of charge. Their customer service is pretty good and they replied to my inquiries right away. Although I still have to pay for shipping to ship the device back to them...)
0,Comfortable to sit in, easy to pack. Wish they had a blow up pillow or something that is reasonably priced as I would like to have something behind my head when watching my kids sporting events. The angle is comfortable for relaxing around a fire, but not to rest your head back while watching players in a field.
0,Works great
0,great
0,nice good idea
0,love the lovkig grips, great feeling, tacky, overall comfortable. wish it didn't have the lettering on the grip, would be more comfy for me without gloves but great nonetheless.
0,Bought this as a replacement for the ENO Bug Net setup since the default paracord is too short to tie from tree to tree. This is more than I'll ever need for my setup, but it feels sturdy and works fairly well.		Con: The only downside is that one of the ends wasn't melted so it's frayed a little, but that's extremely minor and easily taken care of.
0,Works great for me. I had a hard time figuring out how to make it work.(with instructions ) So i went to Amazon and read past customers reviews on set up...Very helpful. Work after first read.very happy.
0,Study, work well, strong velcro. I use this product on daily trail rides and they are holding up well.
0,After scraping off the black coating (in the instructions), there are plenty of sparks to light a fire.  The grip is a little clumsy, but all in all a great product.
0,I gave this as a gag gift to a friend with Ducks in the back yard, guess what granny calls them in every time. No brainer, I would not have believed it had I not seen it myself. Great Duck call.
0,I bought this for my son who has not yet learned to swim but loves being in the water.  The vest is high quality, comfortable and exactly what I wanted/needed.  I love the strap between the legs for that dded security you want knowing the vest won't rid up on your child.  I would highly recommend this!
0,After one day of learning to glide my son was riding his bike without training wheels.
0,what a great find this was!  I'm an umpire and needed something portable and comfy, this chair is unique, the backrest is just right, well worth the few extra bucks, has a carrying strap built in too!
0,Compact. Light weight. Great little pillow for camping.
0,Great item. The set up wasn't difficult...Easy to wear...so many options and wonderfully accurate. Small enough to wear in pocket, around neck or on waist band. I don't even know it's there. Lots of options.
0,have not used yet but look ok
0,The recent order was my second for that reel.  Performance has been good and both will get plenty of work when the weather settles.
0,PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED
0,I can absolutely smash these.  I love the design being a little smaller and not huge like some other hybrid designs.  I bought the 2-5 and love them all.  My biggest problem is the yardage gap these have created between the 5H and my 6 iron.  I wish they would make a 6H in these too.  I highly recommend especially if you are already playing Callaway or just want a smaller more "classic" spoon design.
0,Crude, but well priced.
0,Good deal. Thank you.
0,True to color, although even with maximum inflation there are still some indentation lines visible. Purely cosmetic.
0,Top-notch fin keeper. I used it the day after it arrived diving at the lake. Works great.		The clip is very strong, solid brass. The straps are high-quality webbing, and the snaps are very solid and secure.
0,Fantastic knife. Takes abuse and works great.
0,the pedals seem a bit heavy, and they do not have an allen wrench fitting on the end of the bolt, so you have to use a wrench to put them on the bike. Otherwise, perfect. They hold your foot on the pedal and are easy to get into and out of. If I were doing it again, I would probably just buy the straps and put them on a better set of pedals. But, buying it all done is much easier.
0,This worked great for our snorkel masks. Easy to use. Small enough to put in snorkel bag.
0,works as expected.  love vortex products
0,Mirrycle is my favorite bike mirror, with a very clear reflection.  Somewhat vulnerable though; I've replaced this one on my mountain bike and the hood mount type on my road bike at least once each.
0,Perfect! Carries and stores easily!
0,It works like it looks.  The brush hangs from my golf bag and the clip broke the first week I had it.
0,Very nice sling, the loop makes for quick adjustments and it's comfortable to hold.
0,Purchased for my daughter, a novice hiker on a challenging outing and my daughter was terrific, as was the pack.  Very satisfied!
0,This saw is awesome. Used it for the first time today. Tied it to the end of a rope, threw it over i high branch on a pine tree that was blocking my solar panel. Tied another rope to the other loop handle and made short work of the live branch!
0,This piece spaces out your disc caliper to allow for a bigger brake disc. Works like you expect it to..
0,My son loved it.
0,Excellent! Just what we needed to help improve our golf game!
0,putting these on our Trek Mystic 12 was easy.  so far so good.  pretty straight forward without much you can mess up.  you just need a wrench.
0,For a snowboard jacket you'd expect a bit looser fit below the waist for freedom of movement. My other jackets and coats are XL with plenty of room to spare. For whatever reason, this jacket as well as most other spots gear run a size small. I also believe jackets that extend beyond the top of the buttocks should flair out a bit, instead the latest jacket seems to actually be more form fitting than order Servo jackets. Although a lot of extra room in the chest and shoulders area. You can see what I'm talking about in the stock photo.		That said, it's still a great jacket and the latest version seems to be of better material.
0,the actual color is more bright red than orange. but it is a good fit, and good quality. looks pretty good too.
0,They aren't bad paddles and get the job done. However, when I purchased, I thought they were the contoured ones that fit my hands better. It's awkward swimming with this perfectly flat paddle against your handle.
0,Great for adding accessories in the dozer
0,When I saw the price I figured I'd try it based on the views these were getting. These are great little stoves and if it were made in the US, I'd give it a 5th star. I have a Coleman F1 stove which is similar and doesn't have the igniter. I paid 4 times as much for the Coleman (on sale) and it is just as durable. These little stoves are a great value for the money.
0,Brought for a birthday gift, my nephew is going to love it
0,These are fantastic! I pulled them on as soon as they arrived & thought this is compression in all the right areas! They are tight & a little high wasted but get the job done if you want compression & support. They are look good too. I love them- they are my go to for working out. I am 5'9 & 145lbs.
0,This is a great pool stick my son loves it and it is very straight and well weighted. We are going to order another one from this company in a different color.
0,Go Hawks
0,Fast shipping.. Worked well with my dads cup
0,Awesome fit. Pretty true to size.
0,Awesome.  Use them daily with patients
0,Does the job and fits in my road kit. A good value
0,Took it on a two week section hike of the AT, and while it took a while to get it just right carrying 36 lbs, once I did it felt great. The sleeping bag compartment and all the pouches and zipped pockets and water bladder holder are awesome. You can get a slightly lighter pack if to want to spend a lot more money, but for the money this one can't be beat. I totally recommend this pack if you're on a budget, if your not spend the money for something even lighter.
0,These fit my CZ Lux perfectly...very solid. Now It is easy to fit all the neat sights and scopes I have on this great little 22.
0,Just the right size
0,Perfect for wearing over swim suit during water aerobics.  Purchased this pair after my new board shorts ripped a seam during water aerobics workout.  These shorts are perfect, they move with me and do not restrict me in anyway during lunges, stretches, or any other water activities.  I would definitely buy again.
0,Fit perfectly, looks good and makes it easier to handle gun. Would recommend to anyone needing good grip for 1911.
0,Get's the peoples attention. Used at events and while biking or motorcycle riding to get cars and pedestrians attention. Nicer than yelling "Move', "Watch out buster"!
0,My girlfriend loves this pillow. I'm not sure how comfortable it will be to sleep with. The material has a little sheen, the logo is screen printed on, and the gold trim around the pillow is a jersey-type mesh. Its a cool throw for a bed or couch.
0,Good knife. Opens quick and easy when you pull it. You have to be pretty careful not to open it if you are just taking it out of your pocket. Nice and sharp. I like it!
0,This lock is ok.  It is a relatively light duty chain wrapped in a nylon sleeve.  The locking mechanism works well, and without bolt cutters everything is going to stay put.  A motivated person with a bolt cutter could get through this pretty quickly, but bolt cutters can take out most locks, so no amount of chain is really going to make a difference.
0,Great fit
0,cool but too bulky
0,I wanted a Funtainer for myself after using my daughter's Hello Kitty one. Keeps drinks super cold and keeps hot drinks at a pleasant warmness. Fun color for mom and 4oz bigger to carry more drink. Perfect!
0,Keepers.
0,Is Excellent, very high quality
0,I got this for my boyfriend, who loves it. Saves his back when he works out for hours. Have had it for almost a year now, and it is still in great condition.
0,Get a ton of comments using these in Chicago. Seeing others with the same one, its surprising how much light comes off on the ground. You can see these from probably 270 degrees around me!
0,So it's slightly more than what I really wanted to pay but in the end it's cheaper than having the Maverick 88 tapped. Install is super easy and it's a solid build.
0,Fit and works as expected
0,Great value.
0,This is a great mat.
0,Light weight, good quality
0,Real nice. Strong .
0,Very nice hat for an adjustable.
0,These grips fit very well.  I have very large hands for a women.  The hand grips have a piece of leather that fits perfectly where I usually get all of my calluses from work.  On the end of the leather material is a Velcro strap that was adjustable and attached easily to my wrist.  I really like how firm they stay in place and the protection to my hands to avoid calluses. The holes in which I placed my fingers in accommodated my fingers perfectly.		Received this item for free in exchange for an honest unbiased review.

It is very well made and extremely sturdy.  The mounting bracket has two screws one to mount the device to the bike and the other to secure the flashlight into the mount.  The backlight has adjustable length and flexible mounting holder that can mount securely onto the backseat of almost any bike.  There are three modes: high, low and strobe on  the tail light.  I could only test the tail light because I could did not have the batteries for the flashlight.  (see video).  If you install 3 "AAA" batteries in the flashlight, be sure to remove the portable 23mm cartridge (the second piece).  The flashlight has easily manual adjustment focus that will provide how large or small the beam light is, the smaller range gives more brightness while the wide range will give lower brightness. The tail light was extremely bright and it worked wonderfully without any hitches.  .  Overall this is a very well made, sturdy device.  This is an absolutely must for seeing in the rain, dark roadways or even off the beat and path.  The only negative is that as stated in the directions, it cannot be left out in pouring rain or heaving water so the device would either have to be removed or covered while in downpours or heavy rain.  Other than that, I would say this is definitely a piece of equipment I would highly recommend for any biker.  For safety purposes alone, this is a MUST.	Although I received this product at a discounted rate for my review, my opinions are truthful and honest as I buy many products myself based on product reviews and would not deceive buyers in any way with my own personal product reviews.
0,Scotty good products at a good price
0,Fit directly onto my 700 SPS tactical without issues.  I would recommend to anyone with a rem 700. price was cedent also considering it was from the factory.
0,Fits my LC9 nicely and fits great for IWB carrying at about 4 o'clock on your waist.
0,Honestly, I underestimated this rifle. I am familiar with many air rifles and, for the money, this rifle isn't just a good introduction to air rifles, it's the best to date (I hear FX is launching a disco/marauder killer late this summer). The power is substantial and, with a few tweaks, the rifle has an accuracy of 1.5~2in groups at 50yd.	If you're just starting to shoot or want a good, simi-cheap, plink machine I'd recommend this beauty.		Oh and once you've learned the in's and out's, maybe pay altaros a visit for an easy-to-install regulator to make shots more consistent. Great guy/company.		Scope is kinda cruddy, starts going off to the right after just light use.
0,Fits great!
0,As always another quality product from Lee, This mold produces crisp bullets ( once the mold is properly smoked and heated per Lee instructions)
0,These feel great, I would have liked the top to be a little wider elastic, but otherwise, good product.
0,It makes it easy to pull arrows, not sure what else to say. As you can see from the picture, it doesn't encircle the arrow, but rather clamps down on it, allowing it to pull any size of arrow. No complaints.
0,easily assembled and seems to be sturdy
0,Great anchor at a good price.  Holds well, even in 25 MPH sustained winds.  My boat is only 14', but needed a secure anchor system for a high Sierra lake this summer.  Good choice!
0,worked really well on my Remington fieldmaster
0,A real appearance improvment. I do not notice a better fit. I have big hands and had hopes for more robust sizing. It is better than what came with the gun, but I do not know if it is $40 better. My eye says yes. Yours may not.
0,The MMdex outdoors sleeping mat is exactly what I expected for the $8.45 USD price tag for the 1.5 x 2 m mat.  My (happily unfounded) concern was that it would be not much thicker than two Mylar emergency blankets sewn together with a paper-thin layer of padding between them. Fortunately, it's more sturdy than I feared it might be: my calipers measure it at between 3 - 4 mm thick, so it's comparable to any budget outdoor sleeping mat. The edging is thin and only single-stitched, but the stitching is solid all along the seam.  The nylon stuff sack is a bit thin (as pictured in the description) but not worryingly so; I don't expect it to tear if it just brushes against a branch.		What I received is what I expected for the price.  While I haven't yet had a chance to put it through its paces outdoors, I'm no more worried about this tearing or being punctured than any other ordinary budget outdoor mat.
0,Great bike stand
0,Nice helmet
0,These sights are great. Very heavy duty steel crafted. Tritium glow pops when outdoors or indoor in dark places and mid to good lighting at range. Highly recommended this product.
0,As a former US Paratrooper (Panama '91-'93) with over 10 years of Centro America experience in the the trees with 5 more years now  in Hawaii . I must say this Machete is a BOSS! Look no further then this bad boy ~ Slices coconut tops like a hot knife thru butter . Im 200 lbs and 6 foot tall. This is by far my most favorite machete in the past 25 years. Cheers!
0,I purchased an extra filter. Stores for years. 5000. Gallons of fresh water for future needs.
0,Great Product
0,I purchased it to extend length of pull on my coyote killer, this and a few other goodies and I'm dialed in now
0,Great quality
0,good design, works well
0,Needed this peice of equipment to do GVT with a client of mine, it worked out great. Worth the money and time.
0,Exceptionally well made. Very compact and stowable into vehicles or tight spots.
0,love it
0,This is the nicest little flash/spot light I've used in a very long time.  The bendable magnetic legs let you put it where you need it and since the light itself can rotate on its axis it is very simple to point it where you need to see.  The other thing is that the light itself is very white and intensely bright.  Not blinding but really -- well, illuminating!		Nice to find these in dark spots and work on computers as well.		Highly recommended.
0,I love this thing. I put it in my office at work for when I need a break from sitting.
0,Its the same as CHpastick and over time I will see if it works out well. I will comment if something bad happens.
0,like it.
0,as described
0,Great little lights. Easy to attach and very bright. Well priced
0,Perfect fit in the middle adjustment for my two year old son. He loves it too.
0,VERY Good Holster! Very comparable to a Crossbreed and the one thing I like better about the SHTF is it's smaller in length. That's a good thing! Fit's in between the belt loops better on different types of pants and makes it much more comfortable. I wear this more than my Crossbreed because it takes up less space!
0,This crossbow is absolutely without peer in its price range. I defy anyone to find a better crossbow for the money anywhere on the planet. That is all.
0,Very comfortable. Great for squatting in and great to wear for running. I look forward to ordering more.
0,This is a durable, strong part, well-constructed exercise bike. First, be aware that it's 113 pounds shipped. Getting it out of the box takes two people.		The good:	* smooth pedaling,	*an adjustable memory foam seat;	* options to store 4 profiles so multiple people in the house can track their progress (or lack thereof, depending);	* 12 preset routines	* Bluetooth works well with Android (is supposed to work with iOS, but do not own any to test)	* Tablet holder	* Built in microphone	* Each leg has an adjustable foot for stability in case the floor is not perfectly level	* One of the quietest recumbents I've used	* Water bottle holder	* Multiple targets for heart  rate options		Neutral:	* has wheels on the front to "aid in transport" but the reality of the center of mass of the bike and the awkward carrying of it makes them somewhat vestigial, unless there is something I am missing. This is why it's considered "portable" (that and the relatively light weight compared to other recumbents in the same class)	* Warranty: lifetime for the frame, 1 year for electronics and the wearable parts (belts, etc) and 3 years for the labor and other parts.	* Comes with foot straps	* IRONSTRONG Fitness Pro Apps included (note they are prefaced with the "IRONSTRONG Fitness Pro App features and functions subject to change without notice")	* Grip pulse for heart rate monitoring. Some people prefer straps.		Negatives:	* Because it doesn't fold for storage, it takes up a lot of room. The base measures slightly more than 60".	* Assembly was a little more difficult than expected		Aside from the sheer amount of required space and the assembly issues, this is a great bike that comes highly recommended.
0,Nice solid product. I bought to take to France for a seven day bike trip. ha, TSA confiscated at the airport because it exceeds 10" limit.
0,This crankbait in the orange belly craw color just landed me about a 5lb smallie in early April off the Columbia River. Tried a bunch of stuff that day and this baby produced two fish when nothing else produced (pretty cool water still). Will order a couple more for the box!	**UPDATE**	I fished these through the pre-spawn and well into summer and fall and they never let me down. The action on these square bill cranks is really fantastic and fish bite enticing. I like the shallow retrieve late summer to avoid all the weeds in the river.
0,NICE!!
0,I just like baseball caps..
0,Best bench for the money and then some - I train lots of people of all kinds of strengths and needs, this bench was the best investment I've ever made for a quality bench - Thank You
0,These collars are great, replace all those old spring clamps now.
0,Perfect size, good value.
0,nice gloves
0,nice sturdy material. Works great on the lawn.
0,Works great with Hornady .44 cal. 240 gr. hollow point sabots.
0,After reading the reviews, I chose a size medium. It's perfect. I weigh 130 pounds and I'm 5'7".  My primary use is to wear them under my snowboarding pants. They are great and kept me warm in Oregon, when it was 15' and windy. The waist is large, which is ok with me, cuz my pants and crash pads keep them up. Some of the reviews said that the waist was huge, and I agree, if a person was going to use these as running pants. They are a base layer and not meant to be worn alone. Even as large as my waist is, they were a bit baggy at the waist, but that's fine, since I'd rather have that, than have them as tight as a tourniquet. I wear G-form crash pads over the leggings, and if the waist was tight, it would be uncomfortable. I'm very happy with them. I wash them in cold water, delicate cycle, and I see them lasting a long time.
0,I love these, I have three in two different sizes. All of the parts of this bottle are very durable. I carry one of them with me everyday whether it is camping, hiking, hunting throwing it in the truck, dropping on the ground or just every day running around. The best of a wide mouth and small mouth bottles. Highly recommended
0,Love this light.  It's bright and easy to use.
0,Works
0,I use it to carry stuff from my bigger raft. It can hold one skinny adult on it good. My friend weights about 200 lb and it did hold him fine. But when he got of the raft he fell into the water. I tow it from my bigger raft which can fit 5 people. on this small raft I put beers, air pump, and other stuff I might need. Excellent, easy to patch. I did not use the patch that came with it when it had a hole. I used a better one with cement boat repair. Nothing can beat its price. very very happy.
0,Love these filters for filling my Groove bottle while on the road. Some water fountains can taste like iron or weird but this makes it taste great.	Obviously not ok for untreated water!!
0,Great stuff
0,Great for the price
0,aweasome product, great fit with phone.
0,HOOKUP BOTH PUMPS IT WORKET OUT FINE
0,My 11 year was really enjoying this bat.  Unfortunately, it only lasted three months before it started rattling.  I bumped the rating up by a star and a half as Easton's customer service was outstanding.  They sent a replacement bat within 4 days (just in time for the playoffs).
0,I tried to install fenders on my commute road bike, but gave up after 3 hours of trying because it was just very hard to get them fit and stay put. So, I got the X3 as I saw them on many bikes in front of our building. As suggested by other reviwers, I tighten it up. It was still easy to get on and off, stayed straight, haven't fallen on the wheel yet. Have been through snow and rain, no dirty back and no sand in hair.		As to the front fender, I think it is OK to be without. Feet and legs will be sprayed for sure, but my face has yet to be sprayed and I am not a slow rider.
0,Fit well, looke nice ,,,,,, stylish!  Would recommend for golf!
0,Good case,  Well built; and nicely padded.
0,It seemed completely illogical to need a prep kit, but I never had a leather ball before.  The game ball is amazing and this prep kit makes it even better.		The application and brushing is even fun, but I just like that.  If you are scoping out game balls, factor this kit into the purchase especially as they may be hard to find in stores just like the game balls.
0,Fits my husband well.
0,Great for my five years old. Light racquet that help playing right!
0,bought these lots of times, nice and soft and absorbent, by far my favorite patches
0,work good
0,Bottles are too wide at the base for standard cup holders.		Con: has markings on the side that indicate the fluid level. Kids think they should race each other to drink as fast as possible while in the car on a long trip.
0,Like the Ergon 3's. Loved my old Ergon 5's more. Went back to those. I preferred even more hand positions. Though If you prefer just minimal bar ends with great grips, these are for you.  Solid construction, unbeatable comfort and grip. Top notch grips.
0,A VERY nice product. Feels good in the hand, craftsmanship clearly evident. I appreciate that the ends are able to attach further 'persuasion' items. I'll use this first before a 'prod' any day. My only concern is what will happen when it gets moistened but I don't think that an issue, if so I will edit this review. I would NOT HESITATE to purchase another1
0,I wore this hiking the Appalachian Trail in Maine.  I did 150 miles southbound and they held up, which is quite impressive.		Too bad there were no mirrors growing on trees because I would have liked to stop and stare at myself on occasion.
0,Great bag I use for my first aid kit that I keep in my truck.  Very portable.
0,Love the price, reel works great, would buy again.
0,See I'm a man with big shoulders and I ordered the 6x. It fits my body so comfortably and I feel confident of my appearance. Not too many clothes lets me feel the way I feel when I wear this shirt. I want to tell the company thank you and hopefully we can keep doing business in the future. By meaning and keep your prices at where that it's awesome.
0,Works as it is intended too, with some practice and skill. I will always have this in my backpack but I am also glad it isn't my only means for fire-starting when on the trail.
0,This is my tenth Lee bullet sizing kit.  They all work perfectly, with a very accurate resizing that is dead on the stated value.  Resizing is almost effortless if the bullets are not more than .010" oversized.  The Lee bullet molds cast bullets that should be the correct diameter for reloading, and in that case this resizing kit is a great quality control check for each bullet to ensure that  something didn't hold the bullet mold open to cast an oblong oversized bullet.  It doesn't take long to resize a lot of bullets on a single stage press once you get in the rhythm, but be careful not to pinch tour fingers in the press.		It should be noted that this kit NO LONGER CONTAINS THE BOTTLE OF BULLET LUBE that's shown in the stock photo.  I don't consider that as a negative because I long ago stopped using Alox bullet lube.  It works, but it's messy, sticky and smokey when shot.  I now powder coat my cast lead bullets which is a far better bullet lube in every regard.  It's very clean, both when handling bullets while reloading, handling the loaded ammo, and there's no smoke when shooting.  It behaves much like a plated bullet with no barrel leading up to at least 2200 fps.  However, the few thousandths of an inch of added diameter with powder coating necessitates bullet sizing, but I get very consistent bullet diameters when they're all resized slightly.
0,Very nice, the color an size were like I expected, the quality is excellent, comfortable for running or any other sport.
0,Got this for my 9 and 13 years old boys for Christmas.  This gets used all the time in my house by every kids that comes over.  So much fun.  It holds up great for us adults as well.
0,very comfortable. I am a heavier rider and immediately noticed the difference. I originally ordered as a replacement pad I lost one while transporting my bike. But I feel like I got an upgrade.
0,Worked great on my boat trailer, had my nephew weld it on for me. Very happy, real easy to winch the boat up tight now.
0,I own a Louis Garneau size medium and yet this medium I could not even get over my thigh!
0,Bought these as a gift for my dad. He loves them! Good quality, and the logo is nice and big.
0,I purchased these to use with my ENO doublenest hammock they are quick and easy to setup, they do not stretch and provide enough length to reach trees decently spaced apart.
0,Really comfy shirt. Like it a lot.
0,Easy to carry. Haven't had to use (thank God) but I'm glad I have it around in case it's needed. Great for taking the dog for a walk or going for a run.
0,A bit smaller than I anticipated. I use a HP Spectre laptop and a USB monitor, that this backpack has to carry. They fit, but with the cables and all of the other junk that I need to carry for a week or two on the road, the bag is filled to capacity. I wish that it had a place to clip my keys in one of the front pockets. I used a Swiss Army brand bag before this and it was a bit larger. This bag would not accept a 17" laptop.	Other than those two minor complaints, this is a well made bag. There are two compression straps one vertical and one horizontal to cinch down the bag. This helps keep the bag from making noise and reduces it's size a little. I like the velcro on the top pocket, I've attached a name tape to it.
0,its great
0,My daughter loves this helmet, great price.
0,Loved that I got a utensil set with it. although I didn't realize that from the product descrip0tion
0,I love this knife. I have been researching the perfect woods/survival knife and heard about this one and am perfectly satisfied.
0,THESE THINGS ARE GREAT! AWESOME VALUE! I would buy again but I doubt I'll have too!
0,I use this bottle to keep the cooled boiled water for my baby's formula. It's a pretty large bottle, and being glass is pretty heavy as well, but I love it. I did put hot water in it once and it didn't break.	P.s. the cap is a little hard to put on sometimes but i use it at home so it never really bother me to try a couple of time before it screws on... That's why i removed1 star though.
0,Excellent brand, works like it should. 1 of the many rcbs die sets I own.
0,Does the job.
0,this is an excellent case and a good price. It holds an old long double barrel shotgun very nicely. If you are looking for one, look no further.
0,Thanks
0,Great shirt for the low price. Will buy more.
0,wife loves them and they protect the shoe
0,Very happy with basket - I did not want to add water bottle holder to frame of bike - noticed my water bottle bounced all around the basket and I wanted it to stand upright in one spot for easy retrieval while riding - so I wrapped a small ($1) bungee cord around one side of basket and the bottle stays put - the great thing about this is I can remove or move the bungee cord.  I'm including photos to show the bungee cord added to basket with water bottle in place - Attractive basket - happy with purchase - oh and you can throw your keys in there without worrying about them falling out.
0,Does just what it's meant to do. . . it's improved my putting.
0,Nice little addition to the sheath that comes with the Kabar Eskabar knife. I wish the knife came with a clip by default, but worth the money anyway.
0,quite possible the very best bang for your buck when it comes to red dot, it's only red dot and the reticel is only a dot... that being said, this little puppy is tough... check out the reviews on youtube
0,Exactly what I was needing, fit like a glove!!
0,I love these gloves because they are pretty comfortable.  They run just a bit large though.  I usually wear a large but when I received my large ones, they were just a bit to large making lifting a little "sloppy".  So I ordered the medium and they are just a hair too tight. I'm hoping they will stretch out a little.  Still I love the gloves and the quality is great.
0,Worked as expected!
0,These are great storage units.  The main box seals up nicely and I am comfortable that humidity will not be an issue.  The individual boxes are great.  Much better hinges than the cases with molded hinges.  I have already ordered more.		PS:  Even though they do not sell them as kits, the 100 round boxes for .357, 38, and .44 also fit nicely in these same 50 cal cans, so I have ordered more AC50 cans and the ammo boxes.
0,This is a nice cabinet. All hardware is quality and everything is well aligned. We open and close the doors with each use and they seem to be of good build quality. The black interior lining really creates contrast with the board. LOVE the dry erase score board and they even send the dry erase pen with the board! Our dart board used to be mounted on a cork surface that covered about a 5' x 5' space on the wall (bigger than the board covers with the doors open) - using that setup, it seemed the less experience dart players missed the actual dart board far more frequently than they do with this cabinet. I have no idea why that would be the case, but very few shots now actually miss the board itself (maybe everyone else is getting better). This board is oak finish, but the wood is either pine or poplar (in case that matters to you).
1,Just like a Giant Trash bag.  I suggest getting something more durable and heavier, so it doesn't blow off with a small gust.
1,Size, construction, appearance on this holster is great.  What is not great is, trying to get the weapon out of the holster without pulling it out of your jeans.  After loosening the adjustment screw out completely, prying it as open as I could, still too difficult to get out of the holster.  Read many reviews, and this is not the first time someone has had an issue (Glock 19).  Spraying a silicone spray into the holster was recommended by a reviewer.  Not sure that is acceptable option for me, but worth a try before you return it or throw it in a trash can.
1,The pump will not stay locked, especially when using it at 40+ psi. This makes it useless for my mountain bikes and hybrids. The twist lock for the pump cylinder also locks mid-stroke which is very annoying since it breaks your rhythm keeping you from an efficient pumping pace.
1,Worst buy ever went straight to the trash quality is disaster, waste of money
1,Car magnet won't stick to anything, it's a huge disappointment!
1,I normally don't write reviews, and I'm sure like many others I shop based on customer reviews, but I felt compelled to write a short review for this item.  The sight is crisp and I do like the multi-reticle design.  However, I used this on my Smith and Wesson M&P 15T, using 55 gr .223 FMJ.  The first 100 rounds worked while using this as an absolute co-witness with iron sights to help with the zero.  The next time around, after a few rounds the reticle simply "dropped" down where I had to use the key to move it back up.  After a few more rounds, the same thing occurred.  Perhaps I simply received a defective item, but I was out of the timeframe to return the item.  Better luck to all you other shoppers.
1,Cannot get anywhere near the intensity of working out with a real jump rope.  I suppose it is better than doing nothing at all for exercise.
1,lasted 2 months and the clear bubble fell apart.
1,Goggles fog and do not hold out water too well.	Nose piece does not fit anyone I know of.		But the release works okay and the case zipper does not pop open :)
1,I didn't expect this to be a high quality dart board but I did expect it to work. No matter how hard or soft you throw a dart, when it hits the board it drags down at least 3 inches. This is a horrible product and it is not usable in the least bit. Don't waste your money. Spend an extra $10 and get a real magnetic dart board if you still want a cheap one.
1,Don't waste your money! I would not buy this again. I ended up selling it at a yard sale for 10.00.
1,We place the shower on the cover of our pickup truck all day (very sunny day) and the water never come hot.	Moreover, the bag is very heavy when it's full (and even half full)
1,Bag broke on the first game we used it on. We're avid cornhole players too.
1,It's going to be warm but it's not as snug as it needs to been. I wouldn't buy another one. Alittle disappointed.
1,Not the same Outdoor Connections product I ordered about a year ago, although the name/description remains the same!  My last order arrived as actual leather and canvas (made in Mexico), but the set I just purchased via Amazon.com is synthetic nu-buc (a substitute for leather) and canvas and made in China.  The product model/inventory # remains the same, which is 28030.  An additional difference is in the reduced overall quality of the bags: my original Mexico made bench bags had real leather sewn onto the top and bottom of each bag; the Chinese version has the synthetic material sewn only on the tops, and I actually paid over $8 more for the second set than my first order.  Lastly, the photo accompanying the currently offered bags on Amazon shows the earlier better made product vs what has been shipped to me.  I am not stating that this modified bench rest set will perform less well, but I do think it is unethical for a vendor to falsely advertise any product.
1,cheap and loose. do not buy.
1,Not very comfortable and it works best if you lay on your back.  If you lay on your side, it doesn't support your head that well.
1,i really don't understand why a toy like this exists.  the metal that houses the bolt action part is so poorly constructed of such thin metal that the second you look at it you know this isn't going to last a summer.  the receiver (or whatever terminology you wish; eg the chamber where the bullet and bolt action are), is not connected to any barrel.  instead the receiver/bolt with all of its flimsy metal is actually a separate piece.  there is a visible space between the two!  after the receiver there is no barrel - the end orange capped muzzle is just some small 1" metal tube stuck into the wood.  it really is a one-look-and-hate-it toy.  my boys have some airsoft rifles and this is a step back, way back to 1960.  or 1860.  you could appreciate the fact that the bolt and bolt handle work and can eject the plastic shell.  the shell and bullet are good.  but as a whole this thing is awful.  so bad he (birthday gift for 8 y/o boy) and i looked at each other and i said "forget this one".  if your child is younger i can caution you about the fact that the bolt action is a finger pincher.  so this product is caught not being safe for small kids, being so unrealistic for older kids that i really have to give it an F.  whats there to like?
1,Flimsy - cleaning brushes fell apart quickly. I like my Little Otis a lot more.
1,They were stolen before I could wear
1,i got this for deer season just to give it a try, it worked good till right after the return period ended, then broke, just stuck on the buck call. tried taking it apart to fix it but the little part that actually moves to create the different sounds was so cheap it was not worth my while!
1,I thought the pillow was just too small and didn't really offer any real cushion for my head.
1,Wasn't included in the box.
1,I love my hydroflask, but I don't know if I got a defective lid or it's just poorly designed.  It only takes one or two time popping off the top of a loaded flask to quickly fall out of love with it!  I purchased 5 of these and 4 have worked fine, but the fifth one has put multiple dents in my personal flask (the others were gifts) and cleaning up the mess stinks!
1,I have been intrigued with this product for some time and this summer I have misplaced my headband. I MUST have a headband to keep the water out of my eyes and off of my glasses so I decided upon this as a replacement for my Halo. Bad move.	On the stationary bike, when I lean into my tuck: drip drip drip right on to my eyeglass lens. I tried various iterations with adjustment, placement with no satisfactory results. Later in the day was doing wood working in my garage using it under my safety goggles, with same irritating results. Does not channel the sweat away from my eyes, does not keep the sweat from dripping onto my eyeglasses and although it looks cool, it is worthless. I would opt for a one dollar bandanna over this any day.
1,You have to have the hands of Tony Robbins to fit this thing.  I'm 6'1" 225 and have big hands but I still couldn't get a comfortable grip.  My wife can't shoot it at all.  RETURNED.
1,I was disappointed with the way these pads conform to my knees considering I use McDavid Hexpdads on my elbows.  They are great on my elbows but are not tapered enough from one end to the other to fit my knees properly.
1,Not the quality I was hoping for. I ordered two pouches, one had yellow stains all over it, and the other the US print was crumbling apart. The molle straps on the back looks like single (weak) stitching. Overall I'm very disappointed I'm sure these won't last long before tearing
1,only worked for one month 1/3 of the light do not work
1,I bought this as a temporary thing just to protect my backpack. I really had no great expectations so not terribly disappointed. Like I said,it covers the axe.
1,Not the quality or performance expected.
1,didn't work for my bolts , keeps slipping off
1,Holds ice ok, but the lid is a nightmare to get on. The grooves aren't deep enough to get traction for your fingers. Bought coleman vs igloo cuz typically their coolers are better, but the lid design is a major flaw. Always frustrating to put on or remove. Also, the spout on mine is twisted. Had to pull the nut and attempt to remount it. Still not perfect. It comes out at the 7 o'clock position. Probably just bad quality control. Needs a redesign.
1,Pros: Looks nice, tightly coils. Easy setup		Cons: Coils too tight for my taste		Does not reach well because of curly material.		Look at the pictures. Unfortunately, this thing broke on it's own.		You can see, and clearly predict the key notches inside the lock when it's unlocked.		This thing was holding my bike to a chair on my porch, and was very loose.
1,Pretty cheaply made comes with a little vial that you can't fit any medicine in. The rubber gasket looks like won't last that long
1,The photo of the example is not what you get! BUYER BEWARE. The holster I received was china Junk,. Poor stitching and quality. The photo on the model makes the Holster appear good quality. Retired LEO. I had to eat shipping when I returned this Junk.
1,** There is no active noise cancelation with this headset. **		Active noise cancelation is using microphones to detect certain incoming noises and cancel them out with speakers emitting an opposing sound wave.		This devices AMPLIFIES low volume noises rather than cancels them out but is able to cut this function out if a noise, a gunshot for example, is above a safety threshold.  In this respect, the Peltor headset is excellent.  Rifle reports on the range are never amplified and, therefore, are nicely muted by the earpiece padding.  Voices and other low-volume noises, however, are aplified so that you can hear them over that same dampening padding.		It does pick up so many annoying background noises in addition to the voices and such that I wish to hear, I find myself wearing foam ear plugs as well.  Wind is the prime culprit.  This headset amplifies the wind pretty much constantly.		Someone below mentioned cheap plastic headband.  Mine is a steel band, covered in faux leather.  It's super uncomfortable, placing such pressure upon my ears that I can only wear the Peltor set for limited periods of time.  Everyone's threshold is different, but my ears can hurt all day long after wearing these things.  The same vice-like grip and large ear pieces also interfere with the wearing of eye pro/sunglasses.		Between the wind and the discomfort, the negatives are enough that I've started to leave my Peltor headset in the range bag more often than not.  That's about the worst thing I can say about a piece of gear.
1,It's debatable as to whether or not it actually improved the flavor of the water at work.  But the biggest issue I had with this is that it's just a nuisance trying to suck water out of this.  I finally just brought a PUR pitcher into work instead, pulled the filter out, and used this as a normal bottle.
1,Wow! what can I say...horrible. 4 seams tore with in mins of opening it. Cheap material and poor construction. Giving it a 2 star just because the colors are very bright and pretty and kid loved to play with it indoors. Not a usable umbrella. Just a prop.
1,Watch did not work out of package after charging. Stuck in "Home" mode, returned to Amazon
1,It's metal but very springy, can easily be knocked off zero
1,I ordered a. navy blue small band and I received a black large band
1,After one hard lending it broke. Now the rear guard doesn't hold the position. The plastic is so flimsy, it would happen any ways soon enough.
1,Material was good but, fit was loose. It fit loose on my 500 mosberg 12g i would Not buy again due to it not having a perfect stiff fit
1,the size was to small, definitely not adult as indicated.
1,The first two I ordered was very good and solid. But second pair was smaller and hollow
1,Very small and handle doesn't adjust
1,Not a fan of this level. I have many Wheeler products, but this one was not up to par. As others have stated, you have to fiddle with the level all the time and I didn't think the bubble was true.
1,It's helluva tight fit. Go one size up at least I reckon, then again I'm not exactly what you would call trim and fit. It's smaller than all the other jerseys of similar size I have ever purchased on Amazon.  Plus -Ventilated on the sides. Con - t fabric maybe not as great . Definitely not bang for your buckI would say.
1,The stiring wheel on the scooter keeps coming lose and my son was riding it and he had hurt himself. This was a piece of junk, I will need buy this thing again. Had this scooter for a year only!
1,The second one I ordered to install on the same model bike didn't fit properly.  After lots of hammering I finally got it all the way down the fork tube.  It was that close.  Though it will never come off and the top cap cannot be installed.  The previous one I ordered fit perfectly.
1,I came here and read these reviews.. I said to myself there is no way these neoprene gloves don't keep you warm.. I have neoprene waders and I start sweating as soon as I put them on. Needless to say these gloves made my hands significantly colder than they were with no gloves at all! I cannot tell you how this happens.. I wish I could explain it..	If it's below freezing you will regret bringing these gloves. Such a shame I was really looking forward to a pair of waterproof gloves for ice fishing.	My gloves did stay together the hour or so that I wore them, however I can see how others may fall apart at the seams
1,Is not good for an AR.  At a 100 yards the crosshairs take up over half the target.  WIll not hold a zero.  I read the reviews saying that this was used for an AR and I strongly disagree.  Would work for a .22 or airsoft.  If you are looking to put this on your battle rifle you will be very disappointed.
1,Not impressed not the right size I ordered cheaply made  and just overall not happy
1,Very small. Not suitable for even one adult. I'm 5' 6" 140 lbs and not comfortable with one seat. Better suited for kids.		Construction and durability are sound.
1,Mine lasted about 50 rounds, then the magazine refused to work.  I can't really say anything about the handgun as it was obviously a magazine failure.  I returned the unit.
1,It ripped the first time of wore it.
1,Smaller than every other work shirt I buy.
1,very tricky (lots of velcro) and uncomfortable, sent back.
1,Very cheap quality. Dont buy.
1,I used and liked this product for over a year.  There is a lot to like.  But, the buttons started acting sporadically, and it would not register mileage all the time.  My analysis as a 20 year rider is, the buttons are just cheap and don't stand up over the long run.  I'm going back to a Cat eye which has never given me issues over the years.
1,It just did not fit my gun.
1,Don't buy it
1,Really snug fit on my Glock 17 gen 4, also the clip doesn't work as configured. I fixed it by reversing the clip but would suggest you get a different holster all together.
1,This fell apart in a week for me
1,Garbage, forget mag loaders.
1,Did not fit my pistol & if the description had been clear during the order process, it would have stated it did not fit the poly-handle pistol I was trying to buy it to use with.
1,Ample and sensible storage for an angler who doesn't need space for spare reels. Unacceptable in actually use because the front panel securing three interior trays pops open when the box is moved. Defeats the whole purpose to see your lures and other paraphernalia disappearing into the water or scattered across the bow of your kayak.
1,The knife is okay.  It is made in China.  I will not buy another Spyderco.
1,I returned this item due to faulty construction the top strap that goes across your head was sewn in the wrong place and it would not stay on my head kept slipping down.
1,Palm is not grippy and the stitching is  starting to unravel after wearing 3 times.
1,I purchased this because of the color, price, and reviews, but the stupid lid pops off too easily and the bottle leaked all over my school books!  If you look at the picture you'll notice a tiny piece protruding on the edge.  This piece is leverage for your thumb to pop open the lid.  Unfortunately it is leverage for anything that bumps against it as well, making it a terrible design for carrying it anywhere other than your hands.
1,Works ok. Deffinately get what you pay for. This is my 3rd bottle all of different brands. I can say this is the lightest feeling one. The threads for the cap are very shallow. My hydroflask brand cap does not fit well. The hole on the bottom that Is soldered or epoxy filled in the more expensive bottles is covered with what appears to be a foil sticker. Doubt that will hold up. Overall it is just of poor quality.
1,I got only one and this one broke at the first use. not good
1,Garbage. Two of them were not working right out of the package. Another one broke within a week.
1,The size of this seems great, however, when we tried testing it, we could only get it to fire once in awhile with great difficulty.  We bought this to replace a larger one we have, but as this doesn't work (and it can't be returned), we'll be keeping the larger one).
1,not sure why but it didn't work
1,fall off the pole very easy. Clip is badly designed.
1,couldnt give 0 stars. I ordered the first one and dropped it once when full ON CARPET! the bottem cracked open. And the water flow just didn't not work. they were more then happy to replace the cracked one no questions asked but the second one did the same thing and the lid has the same water flow issue. I bought one a few years back that i loved that needed replacement and im extremely disappointed. and because my first one was replaced the second one they gave me when i tried to send it back to get my money back they never refunded me :(		edit:took up a case with amazon and was finally refunded.
1,Installed 3 AAA batteries lite up for about a min and foul burning smell.  Light was no way close to the brightness the mentioned even thru the thick magnification.  Hi power was converted to heat, really wanted a bright flashlight for have in pocket.
1,4 of the lures almost all clear plastic, poor paint quality, and only 1 lure rattled. The one lure that rattled was very nice, wish the other 7 were the same.  Sending them back.
1,I ordered 3 of these shirts, same size, different colors. I felt like Goldilocks. One was too big, one was too small, one fit just right.
1,we bought this for our daughter's Radio Flyer tricycle...		its too big for the main section of handle-bar (even when cranked all the way down), and too small if I try to slide up over the thicker handle part.		I tried wrapping some electrical tape around the handlebar to make it ticker.. seemed to work, but the next day the bell was slipping around.		Its a good sounding bell, but need a better/more-flexible mount.
1,The first day I went out for some outdoor shooting (last week) it got pinched in a harmless bushes. I felt it was too soft material since the very beginning, and now it is useless after a little scratch. I just wanted a durable ball and I was able to pay a good price for it. Anyone has a real recommendation for me?
1,only big enough for my 22 rifle
1,In theory, this sight sounded good. In practice, not so much.		First, it wasn't as simple to align as some youtube videos made it appear. Took me the longest time getting the black dot centered, as there is no visual feed back on the adjustment screws. Only way to know was to adjust, then draw bow back and look thru peep and repeat. Found it super tedious and frustrating.		When I finally got it set up, it turned out to be more of a distraction when aiming, due to the fact that  the IQ site glowed so much more brighter than the pins.		Also, the housing is so much larger than other pin sights, that I actually had to go with a bigger peep sight. Did not care for that at all, as my grouping got worst.		In the end, this sight did not improve my grouping at all, but actually made it worse. Threw it in the trash and went back to my single pin roving sight.
1,I received a medium
1,unsafe to use
1,I liked these at first as they were inexpensive, fit well, are comfortable, and are thick enough to look and feel substantial.  Unfortunately, after about 5 or 6 hourlong rides and two washes, tiny holes developed along and next to the seams in the seat.  I have to throw these out since the holes will only get worse with wear or washes and since they're not repairable due to the fabric and fit of the tights.  I have a 25" waist and my tights were slightly large in a size 26", so the issue was not that they were too small. Just a lack of quality, I guess.  I'm disappointed and am returning the second pair I bought.
1,This was a great product to have until the display started to die.  I use this to count my steps and record my regular workouts.  I have never overcharged it, and it is never put in extreme conditions.  This product is not worth the money, and I would never recommend this or a newer version of this.
1,Did not help at all for nightine bike riding.
1,kinda uncomfortable
1,Pros: light, no blade	Cons: not rubberized,  uncomfortable grip		Well I knew these are made of durable Santoprene material but the title says rubber and they claim that it is rubberized but the whole thing feels as if it made of HARD polymer. it does bend a little when flexed but i would advise against doing hard thrust at a opponent with this as while it probably won't break skin it could still cause some tissue damage. Also this plastic Knife has the most aggressive checkering I've seen on a knife after a fifteen minutes of sparing my palms were a little sore.
1,The net's zipper started to fall apart within a year. Honestly I would suggest for anyone to go buy one of the much nicer hammocks and better quality than to buy this.
1,This stand has one fatal flaw. It will not hold up a bicycle without collapsing. The two bolts, that are supposed to keep the stand upright, slip.	I have tightened them so much I have deformed the tubes and it still doesn't work.
1,This arrived a couple of weeks before Xmas as a gift for my son.  On Xmas Eve, Santa went to assemble it.  First, no instructions were in the box.  But Santa is pretty smart and set out to assemble it anyway.  Midway through the installation, Santa discovered that the frame was routed incorrectly and the table top would not fit into the frame.  Boxed back up and shipped back.		To their credit, Sportsman's Guide was very good with handling the return.
1,They're too small for nearly any scope. If you only have a 24mm objective like you find on 1-4x scopes they'll pass. But for anything like a 36mm to 40mm and larger they're too small.  It was a good idea, but poor execution.
1,case is mighty flimsy.  might as well have contents in a bag.  Solvent bottle leaked in my range bag
1,Love this lube, but the bottle they shipped mine in is a joke. It has what I'd believe is a child-proof cap. The problem is that, after a while, it's almost impossible to get the cap off with your bare hands. It makes it essentially useless.
1,Bottom of barrel cheap, which isn't saying much because that's what they cost, but still. Took a VERY long time to get here, and when it did the cap wouldnt screw back on, and the sandpaper strip had already fallen off. Just a waste, go to REI or somewhere reputable to buy the real thing.
1,I've had this towel for about two months. I use it at the gym. I shave my head and sweat a lot.		This towel is very stiff. Perhaps it will soften up after more washes.		It has a lot of "drag," making it difficult to wipe sweat from the skin.		I don't really like it.
1,Good idea, but to hard to push the button even for older tots.
1,Just received this item today great bottle but Im missing the pouch look through the whole package there is nothing. I must say false description, only giving two stars
1,Totally useless, never worked on my glasses or goggles and ruined my swimming goggles :(
1,The retainer eye is thin and broke through and the stop watch dropped off the strap. The stopwatch works fine but what good is it if it falls off and gets lost.
1,Didn't fit well had to shave it down	The peg stuck far outside the the slide a total half inch so that needed to be trimmed	I was hoping since the G17 has been around for over 25 years a company like blade tech would have the size right	It's just wasn't drop in ready
1,Meh... hard to put on, and the velcro closure was not only hard to close, but tough to stay closed. They kept my feet warm for the most part, but it was irritating to have the velcro open up while riding. Unfortunately, I put up with them too long and could not return when I finally felt they just weren't going to work for me. I wore them twice (weather has been too nice, I guess!) I ended up buying the Gore boots... I think having a zipper is preferable to velcro.
1,A piece of junk. worthless latches that don't lock. as soon as you lift it the gear falls out. Save your money.
1,cap runs very small. I ordered X-Large size and it was still too small to wear. Had to return.
1,The only reason I am still using these, is because they are not worth the effort of returning.  I bought these gloves specifically for my at home kettle bell workouts.  I wanted the extra wrist protection for when I do kettle bell presses or snatches.  As far as wrist protection is concerned - they only work okay.  If I do too many sets I will still get a little bruise, but I have pretty bony wrists and it's obviously better than no protection at all.  As far as hand / callus protection - nonexistent.  Sometimes I think these rub worse than if I wasn't wearing anything at all.
1,Didn't work. Followed directions and still leaked. Most holes on inflatable's are at the seams and this product, although tacky, did not seal the leak
1,I'd give it no star if I could. The adjustment screw that adjusts the amount of tension on the quick disconnect  fell out in the middle of a competition and I was left having to shoot 1X out to 300 yards this weekend. This thing only had a few hundred rounds through it before it happened. Complete garbage. Save your money and buy a good one. See my video to see how bad the Parallax error became.
1,I bought these because it says "elastic" in the name of the product. They are NOT elastic! Just sturdy cotton type of material. I've been using Tigear brand wraps for over 10 years, THOSE are ELASTIC. I'm trying to find something like that on Amazon, and these Sanabul were not it.
1,Cheap and nasty.  You have the impression from the picture that the handle is of decent length, but in fact, the black portion is flexible and weak because the metal extends inside it only a short distance and is very skinny (as you will find when it breaks off).  Terrible design for a tool.  Definitely do not recommend.
1,Gross smell to it, cover breaks off easily
1,the product is very good !!!! but I was sent only one ..... and should be two bags !!!!
1,Came late and broken - part of a birthday gift but had to return. Disappointed.
1,Broke on first use out of return policy window. Several holes in bag, leaked from hose as well. I'm sure I got a faulty product and would have been happy to get a replacement but their policy of not doing so makes it seem this must be a common problem.
1,The headband is only one layer of fabric, which surprised me, it's not even hemmed it's just cut, seems cheap. Since it's so thin it looks weird on your head, like you are in the hospital or like you are just holding your hair back for a facial treatment or something.
1,For the price it is ok although the bristles become deformed and worn out very quickly and the bristles are very stiff so your arrow won't fly as fast.
1,Not that pleased.... After about 500+ yards they start leaking and they create discomfort on the bridge of the nose.  Not worth the price!
1,poor quality, but fast shipping
1,Poor quality. Runs small. Will cook up your kids hands. Poor blood flow. Never again.
1,I had to return it . the material its made of makes it sorta hang off you . I don't know if a smaller size would work for me or not
1,I guess you really get what you pay for. Ok on the low power but is real fuzzy on high power. Lenses not sharp enough to see target hits at over 100 yds.
1,Does not stay closed!
1,Bought so I could fit in with my cracker friends. Works like a charm. Hat must have been made to fit over Trump's impressive hairpiece, it's way too large for my normal sized noggin.
1,I literally tried to fit the chinstrap and it broke one end. Ok, no big deal, I just tied it all back together, tried to fit it into the other side and one of the fasteners literally broke. TRYING TO FIT IT.		Buy something else.
1,The dots work but there is absolutely no magnification.
1,I bought these based on another reviewer saying that with some work they will fit on the Howard Leight Impact Sport headset. They kind of fit. Even with my best attempt to get them on they still leave a half an inch of the Velcro exposed. Not overly pleased with this product. And a bit overpriced at $20.
1,I knew i was receiving a random selection, but come on you sent me the crapiest ones. Some look like the print is messed up on the flight. If you don't mind getting some basic or non interesting picture on your flights then i guess there okay. But don't expect to get the ones in the first picture. The best one i had was the flame one if that says anything...
1,I bought this on the reputation of the manufacturer, which is very good.  I hope I never have to use this product, but it's nice to know I have it with me when I am out walking the dogs.  It's pricey, but it will be worth the cost if I ever have to use it.		UPDATE:  I used this product on a marauding German Shepard challenging my Golden Retriever and Border Collie.  I was greatly disappointed since the spray only extended out 7 to 10 feet at most and dispersed in a very wide cloud pattern, which is not what I expected at all.  I expected this product to reach out between 20 and 30 feet in a much more focused and narrow spray pattern.  If this was to be used on a bear, it would be too little, too late.
1,Color did not match my fde sig rifle
1,Hmmmm only been doing yoga for a couple months to Bryan Kest Power Yoga and I like his much better.  He has a whole class and the guys are hot hot hot.  This DVD is cheaply made and skips.  The moves are almost identical to Kest.  I will be returning for the skip.  Not a good video.
1,It was ok for the first use but leaked slightly after that.  We didn't use it for anything critical, but a $20 bill got a little damp.  It was fine for being able to keep the hotel key in it.
1,Finally got around to using it not worth it
1,returned
1,Bad I sent it back it is junk
1,Does not ever seem to automatically sync. The heartbeat sensor is now always incorrect. My resting heartrate on my Galaxy note is 58, O2 pulse claims its at 137. Good sync in with the Withings ecosystem. They make a dynamite scale. Good pedometer but the advertised features do not function as...well...advertised.
1,This bar works, but in no way is a good one. Even with the hacksaw blade they give you (which is great for magnesium fire starters!), the magnesium is hard to shave off. This is a cheap poorly made Chinese bar. In a true survival situation, you want a better bar. This does work, but it takes a while. The magnesium is hard to light and doesn't burn that well. It doesn't seem to burn hot enough to light a lot of tinders, especially damp tinder. It will burn though. Not recommended for a survival kit/bob. I gave it two stars because it is function, just real poor quality. Almost an imposter bar. Spend a little more and get a doan bar or something made in the US. On the plus side though, the hack saw blade piece is nice. If you already bought this, you can stick that blade onto a better bar with some parachord or something.
1,Good quality
1,THIS IS NOT Molle compatable.
1,Very poor quality and size was smaller than expected.
1,They roll up, super annoying
1,Too small for my bicep.
1,used for a few month now. Very large bulky. Easy to get water inside. Not comfortable.		Never buy this brand again. I used the VIEW for long time before I got this. It feels so soft and comfortable. I will go back to the VIEW.
1,Too flimsy for a large auto.  Don't like it at all
1,Quoted dimensions are way off. Tried inserting three different cell phones having overall sizes that should have easily slid in and out. No luck. If you do manage to get a phone into the case, good luck trying to get it out.
1,I Bought this for my wife thinking this would be perfect. It fit nice around her waist but She couldn't get her gun in the holster and get it snapped. She carrys a M&P shield so its a Fairly small gun.  Then when I got it snapped for her she couldn't get it unsnapped to the the gun out. So unfortunately this product was either defective or useless. I only gave it a 2 because the waist ban fit well.
1,I was hoping that this Folding D-Ring Cap would be significantly shorter than the original (cheaper) one-piece hook-loop cap. I "up-graded?" to this Flip-Ring Cap, in order to afford more space, inside my MOLLE Water-Bottle Carrier, for other items, such as the Kleen-Kanteen Shoulder Strap and, maybe a nested cup, a small bag of Sqwinchers Flavored Hydration Salts, etc. ...	... I am disappointed and would return this item, if I had the time to deal with the hassel ... no sum gain !		  To add insult, the metal "flip" D-Ring rattles and will make noise, if not secured.  Not a great design.		  I do not like it and wish I had not ordered it !		  I do just love the Kleen-Kanteen 40 oz. SS bottle and the optional carry-strap is "adequate".		  Save your money ! ... Go with the cheaper ONE PIECE cap design ... It actually is more practical (and cheaper).		  TRUTH (Don't say I din't warn ya).
1,These (like other microfiber) are not very absorbent. Feels like rubbing a soft shammy on your face.  Almost feels like it just pushes the sweat or moisture instead of absorbing it!  I very much dislike them.
1,I bought the certified refurbished unit and it was locked up tight and would not move at all.  Bought another one at wal-mart and it works great.
1,Very disappointed with this jacket. Own another mountain hardware bought at REI few years ago and it is day and night.  Not very warm and even worst, not fitted and very big compared with my previous jacket.
1,Horribly hard to put batteries in and one didn't work.
1,Bought these trying to be cheap.  I did not like the way they get close and feel that they do move a little while firing.  I could not get good groups with them but the moment I change to a more quality set the groups improved dramatically.
1,As others have written, the fabric is thin and the plastic surface strips are a bit off-putting. I would say they are poor as exclusive mittens except in very mild (fall or spring) weather, they could only be mitten liners in Michigan or New England winters! As liners go, these are very pricey. The size runs large (baggy) for use as a liner. If they nested about five of these (each smaller than the one outside it) you might have a decent winter mitten. At 25$ per pair, the combined mitten would obviously cost $125 and would not be competitive.
1,Balls consistently jams. Lower wheel stopped working after 2 months. Returned. Buy the robo-pong. It's more expensive but well worth it.
1,Look like a nice bag but the one they sent me had a snap cap missing and the bag end drag cap was missing. Am returning it. I would like to have one but I am scared of getting another junk one and I can't find anyway to contact Amazon.
1,Cheap Chinese material (Not all Chinese stuff are bad) but this one feels like made of recycled plastic
1,It work when it wants to work.not happy with it.
1,Same crappy arrows I ordered last time.  The tips have a non standard thread.
1,I don't know if I would even really call these "compression socks." Compression socks should have the highest level of compression at the ankle and the least amount of compression at the top, to facilitate blood return to the heart and reduce pooling in the lower legs. That's how they work - they promote circulation through the legs and, in theory, keep fluid and "used" blood moving. These socks, however, are backwards - the compression is all at the top (closest to the knee), with loose ankles! And no, I don't have tiny ankles, my ankles are actually on the larger side (no ankle bracelets for me). If you want a true compression sock, you need to measure yourself and then either hit up a medical supply store (the much more affordable option) or order a pair from a reputable brand that sells socks by calf width and length (the expensive option). I have a couple of pairs from CEP, and they are worlds away from these socks - much tighter from ankle to knee. Lesson learned...the $60 compression socks I bought for marathon training have no cheap competition.
1,Basket is okay but the bracket is terrible. In addition to rubbing the front of your bike, the bracket also breaks off at the rivet as soon as it gets bumped.
1,Gets the chlorine out, but has no conditioning quality at all... can't comb through afterward.  Works fine along with a conditioner, but not as a 2-in-1.
1,I have had this wheel on my errand bike for about 8 months.  I have broken 3 spokes already.  This bike is not abused or ridden hard.  I use it to run errands around town and to ride to the beach.  I put less than 40 miles a month on the bike, so I am breaking spokes after only 300 miles.		If you plan on actually putting miles on your bike, I recommend getting a hand built wheel with high quality spokes.  This is the second cheap wheel that I have purchased in the last 2 years- and I still am having problems.  I would have been ahead financially if I just went down to the bike shop and spend $80 to get my original wheel properly rebuilt.
1,I purchased two of these gears to go on a tandem tricycle I am building, one came apart as I was installing the chain the other made it about 1/8 of a mile before coming apart. I now have two used gears installed that work fine, but intend to replace with new  Shimano. This is a very poorly made product and I would not recommend to anyone.
1,At 10meters using a Crosman 2240 with a 3x-7x Winchester scope I can put 4 Daisy flat-nosed pellets (500 in a tin) through the same hole, but the 5th usually is a flyer about 1" away.		The Daisy pellets are way better than the Crosman hollow points, but not as good as the Gamo wadcutters in the 250 pellet tins. The Crosman are so bad I thought my scope was broken! I can put Gamo pellets through the same hole in paper targets with way fewer flyers than the Daisy pellets.		The Crosmans leave lots of lead on the fingers. The Daisy pellets leave a shocking amount of graphite(?) and/or lead on the fingers. Load one Daisy pellets and your fingers will be black (not grey). The Gamos are just like the .177 pellets.		By the way: In .177  Benjamin HP's are the best in my Gamo Silent Cat rifle, and my Crosman Fury likes Gamo Tomahawk pellets: I've tried about 13 different pellets so far in those. The point? Keep trying different pellets in all your guns.
1,Not for swimming or swim training. Tons of water either leaks or splashes in, choked a bunch with heavy respirations. IF you want to exert yourself in the water, the TYR ultralite is the best, except you have to use goggles, instead of mask.
1,I used this product on my prescription glasses which I then wore inside ski goggles. I can't speak to its effectiveness for scuba or other uses, but for my use this product did not really work at all. In addition i found the application process way to complicated and time consuming. The spray shoots out globes of the stuff that spatter more than mist onto the surface you're applying it too. It dries into hazy crust which they then tell you to buff.		My expectations for a product like this is something I can spritz on that dries quickly and clear (this stuff takes hours to dry even with a heater). I'd rather it be easy to apply and have to re-apply it a few times throughout the day then a product like this which you have to apply the night before and which still doesn't work.
1,First impression was the color is not the same as the picture. It is very dark and blotchy. Not very even across the leather. Almost no retention and it smells really bad. I may not bother to return it, but I would never buy another one.
1,Not a good dry light towel - it sucks up water and barely wrings out, which is the point of this product. Also, the color bleeds onto other things.	I bought a shammy instead - lighter, more effective.
1,Horrible!!! Thought this grip would have a more stiff structure and a solid mounting area for the screw. I lightly tighten the grip on and it seems too small and grip comes right off. It's very soft n flexible so side panels collapses when gripping the pistol. I expected better quality from Pearce.
1,The dimensions were great.  I used it to wrap my bag over in a Basil basket on top of a bike rack.  It was never over stretched or anything.  Before the spring started (in Feb and bought it in Oct) it started to give (increased twice in size), and by the end of the month it was unusable.  It was cheap, but I don't think should be disposable.
1,"New Self Cocking 80Lbs Draw Crossbow Pistol":First I tried to assemble, and the prod did break when I tried to put string on place - prod become split on 3 layers(two thicker and one thin) and the front layer did break very easy,-	I don't think that the force I did apply was 80 Lbs - definitively less. So even if I would manage to put string on place, the prod is breakable by the force less than 80 Lbs and it could break in a moment of "(self-)cocking". In instruction one person should ask another person to help to "install" the string.	- I don't have any second person to ask. Would you buy toilet paper brand which requires that you have to ask to help another person - to wipe your a$$, wouldn't you?! - That person definitely shouldn't be nor your friend, nor your enemy, nor your neighbour. - I think that with such a weak prod even two persons couldn't reach the needed symmetry, - that's a task for "1 person with 4 hands"!	- Two weeks later I received the new prod ~80Lbs from Amazon. I put two layers of black electrical tape on this prod, - to reduce some possibility of splitting, - and tape was so elastic that I don't think that I increased 80Lbs more than by 5%, which is not more than the common systematic error in usual engineering calculations. When I inserted this prod into its stock-position, I changed two thin rectangular rubber pieces into same sizes soft steel plates and bended one of them to suite prod's retaining screw. With two pairs of heavy-duty dog-leash-chains and two pairs of vices and a lot of patience I alone managed to put 17.5" string on 17" prod with the most symmetry as I could.	- But the next stage - "(self-)cocking" (before load) now begin to be a problem. I'm definitely not a weak man (~40cm around biceps), but I couldn't reach (self-)cocking position (~1" left),- even when I put/based stock's handle into my abdomen's muscles, when holding the stock by my left hand and lever's handle by my right hand,- I did squeeze/ bow it with almost all my force,- ~1" more left to go yet!	I'm still thinking how to do the "(self-)cocking". Probably if I install the	second handle in the ~ middle of the stock - to create poweful enough leverage.
1,Hard to read. Can't read it at an angle. I would recommend buying something else.
1,too low - guess thats why its a BEACH rocker
1,Seems thin & doesn't hold air well.
1,ordered a medium sized rug after read many good reviews, but it's way too big than it has been advertised (fits 4-5in). no idea why the product description is not mentioning actual size so that buyers can be a bit more sure if it's a good fit ...
1,Absolutely does NOT fit the Alpha 1 Gen 2 without notching the prop side.  It's seriously a good inch off.  It seems they have one massive quality control problem.  My only saving grace was I snapped that part of the OEM skeg off over the weekend from a 5ft wave slamming the boat onto shore.  Also, there was no loctite in the package.
1,Product was returned purchased wrong item
1,The sizing in the description is completely off and different from whats on the packaging.  I bought these socks for my 4 year old based on the size listed in the description which is "Toddler 4-5.5".  The socks came as a "YXS, Youth Extra Small" which is intended for "6-18 months".  Maybe its me, but 6-18 months old is not a toddler...and certainly not a toddler size 4-5.5 as its listed in the description.
1,I bought this item DESPITE the reviews it had for the poles snapping, thinking, "Oh, that must just be a fluke."  I was wrong.  Took it to Destin, FL, and it broke on day 4 in 5-10 mph winds...nothing strong or unusual for the beach.  I called the company and was excited to hear it was under warranty for three months.  I had to fax in a copy of my receipt and they would take care of it.  Needless to say, that was last summer and I have yet to get a response.  Many e-mails, faxes, and phone calls later I have never been able to get in touch with anyone again.  I'm going to try to rig it to work...but I haven't had time to mess with it.  Would not recommend unless they can find a way to make the poles thicker and stronger.  If they do, I will definitely consider buying a newer model and trying it again.  Great concept and easy set-up. Saves big bucks on beach umbrella rental for a cool product, just needs to be made stronger.
1,Sharp but tiny. About a quarter of the size of a regular razor blade.
1,Leaks air
1,Bulky and not reliable.
1,and plastic made to look like metal.  neither mountain nor road bike fit in it either.  good idea which was poorly and cheaply executed.  boo.  do better Topeak.
1,These are tiny. Not even close to big enough to wash camp dishes.
1,The metal Gets rusty even when dry. Heavy. Expensive. Tire lever got bent easily. You cannot replace that.	Bulky to carry in road bikes. Its ok for touring or MTB's. But there are lot better ones than TOPEAK,
1,THEY COME WRAPPED AROUND A PIECE OF CARBOARD, AND U CANT GET THE BEND OUT OF THE BRACELET, NOT OF GOOD QUAILITY AT ALL, POORLY MADE, WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.
1,This did not work well for me. I have a medium sized hand (according to the gloves that fit me) and I had to extend my middle finger off the pistol handle in order to release the locking mechanism. Its advertised to release just by getting a proper grip on the pistol - as your middle finger should be in contact with, and applying sufficient pressure to, the releasing mechanism but there was a small space between my finger and the release mechanism. I don't know if that means I have small hands, or if the handle of my pistol doesn't work well with this holster. On a positive note, I was able to easily set the retention screw to keep my pistol from rattling in the holster. Regardless, I sent it back.
1,Item listed as 11" long.  It is not, it is barely 8",  too short for any leverage.
1,Two years ago I purchased several different Guide Gear Ladder stands from Sportsman's Guide.  At first glance I was not impressed but at least thought they may be worth the cost.  I was wrong.  From the beginning, it was clear that the quality and workmanship was suspect.  Pieces fit together poorly and directions were difficult to follow.  It only got worse from here.  When the stands were mounted on a tree they are very loud.  They crack and make sounds with every little move.  Trying to move into position for a shot while bowhunting is impossible.  Over time, the sounds have performance have gotten worse.  After the first year, there was a lot of rust already showing on the metal.  The paint on the stands is razor thin and needs to be completely redone in order to prevent rust.  Although its really not worth the trouble given the mechanical problems of the stands.  I have learned my lesson and will not do business with Sportsman's Guide again.
1,When I first got it, it was staying inflated for one night. The next use, it would need pumping again.		Then a few days after the one month return window, it will not stay inflated more than an hour or two.		So now I am stuck with it. I have to pay all shipping fees. I have contacted Coleman's, as they appear to be the distributor.		I want to know what kind of partial refund Amazon are offering, up front and compare that to whatever Coleman have to say.
1,So I have a decently large sized head and this thing just pinches a little bit. If it was a little bit bigger it would be really comfortable it makes me really envious of all the tiny headed people when I'm wearing this hat in the garden.
1,I returned this cycling cap because it had too much structure. The brim was stiff and hard to flip up when not needed. The band was thick and caused my head to throb under my helmet. The logo under the brim was distracting.
1,Terrible quality.  Do not waste your time.
1,I only used this for a few weeks to help keep my jaw closed with my CPAP mask and it has stretched out and no longer works as intended. It worked great initially but the fact that it is not adjustable is a major issue.
1,This is the second Crosman gun I bought. The first one what 40 bucks and was horrible which is to be expected and this one did not come with the scope stop so the scope slides back and has so much recoil that it broke the crosshairs in a $60 scope. I hate the way the make their products.
1,I was looking for a summer running capri pant, but the material was too thin for me and did not provide the coverage that I need.
1,Absolute JUNK!  Don't waste your time and money on this POS!  Fell apart first time I used it.  Unfortunately for me, this occurred outside the time for a return, so I'm stuck with it.
1,Way to small
1,Way too small....
1,These are no where near as good as the Nike dri-fit socks I got at Kohls.  There is an obvious difference in quality and sizing.  The good socks have a red "L" and "R" stitched into them.  These do not.  They are far too tight and do not do a good job of keeping my feet dry and comfortable.  I do not know if these are fakes or just a different style, but find the ones with red letter stitching and get those even if they cost more.
1,I purchased this suit and sent it right back. It was way to tight. I recommend buying a size up. But I'm also a busty girl on top and bottom, so this was not the right suit for me. I got my refund as soon I dropped  it off to be shipped back- which helped a great deal so I could purchase another suit right away.
1,Cracked in half when arrived
1,It is a nice tank top, however, will not be able to wear it, lol!!! I wear between a small/medium...but I would wear an extra large in this tank!!
1,measured my ear in accordance with the instructions and they were too big.  They hurt.		I also tried foam EP4s and they hurt too.		I just use orange, foam ear plugs now.
1,These gloves are a great idea, and I think with some additional tweaking they could be great. That being said, they didn't work well for me. The first time I put them on I received calluses. Keep testing different materials and maybe extend the material on the fingers and you could have a great product.
1,I know these are "youth" arrows, but they are pretty low quality.  We used them for a few days and then threw them away.
1,It's colorless and odorless which makes it very unnatural. It does go on smooth and dries quickly however, the ingredients for this is less than desirable, for anyone who cares about what is actually in the product and will go on your skin in the most sensitive places. It is a chemical and animal based product loaded with silicone, about the only thing natural in this product is the Shea Butter. Not sure if the Emulsifying Wax NF is plant derived or not, it doesn't state on the package or the manufacturer's web site. I just don't see the need for many of these unnatural products when it's being used by someone you would think is on the health track. I've uploaded a photo of the back of box.

1,Im not sure if I received a defective item because I do not understand why anyone would buy this. The training aid has specific directions how to put on your club. The material is made so tightly that it made scratches on my new driver grip. You can imagine how angry you would be getting a scratch bc of a grip aid and scratching your head as to how you can scratch up a grip. I have the SKLZ grip aid that works much better, a little lose but when used properly your thumbs should hold it in place.		My recommendation is DO NOT BUY, your club grips will pay the price. Also this is very overpriced vs. competitors for no reason.
1,the string tears the tip away from the limb.
1,I will not buy this again!  Pieces don't stay together and its so cheap and flimsy that any time it rains I check my boat and its fallen down and in pieces again thus no doing what I bought it for.  maybe if you duct tape all the pieces together then support the base with sand bags it will stay where you put it...
1,We love Lee reloading equipment but the machining wasn't finished... bullet couldn't pass through the tube base.		Ended up buying a RCBS bullet feeder...
1,Didn't fit anything I tried it on.
1,I ordered and received this item in February 2013. It is used as an every day carry knife and is carried clipped into my front pocket.  Since receiving the knife and over the short period of time I have had it, the knife blade when closed, slides from side to side and rattle like a pocket full of change.  Most recently I have stopped carrying altogether because the screws for the clip have stripped out and the clip can no longer be attached.  I have carried may Gerber knives in my lifetime and this is the worst product I have ever owned.  It is past the return date so I guess it'll sit on my dresser till I get tired of looking at it and just throw it away!!  I won't buy anymore knives through Amazon.  I'll go straight to the dealer so I can get a better guarantee on quality.
1,Kinda Flimsy feeling .. meh.. I would NOT use for anything too important
1,They look pretty cool but smell terrible. I washed them three times, but the plastic odor is still there.
1,When I removed them from the packaging, they looked nice for the price but as I when to try them on, I was very displeased when one of them broke before I could get it passed my fingers.
1,On the photo for this item they weren't differentiating between "Mandrake" and "Highlander" so I ordered the one I wanted - Highlander. Unfortunately the one that came was, in fact, Mandrake. There's way too much green on the cap for my liking.		I just went back and checked the listing for this item and noticed that they have changed the selection to its actual pattern; Mandrake and there is no further option for Highlander. Apparently I wasn't the only one that had this issue.
1,Very cheap and not alot of foam. Sent it back and bought a Flambeau.
1,I tried it, and returned it. Overall, it seemed pretty cool, but get on it and hit what seems like an average speed and the thing starts slowing down by leaning you backwards. As you compensate for it, it stops and you fly off. After about ten times of trying to compensate for it, I packed it back in the box and shipped it back. If you could override the way it slows you down, it might be a winner... But not in this iteration.
1,Garbage.... the pad was ripped... the bolts didn't fit right had to drill and size the holes, some of the support pieces were bent and the box it came in was absolutely destroyed Im beyond frustrated with the 100 dollars I spent on this... couldve have gotten a used one on Craigslist for 15 bucks that was better shape then this piece......
1,disappointed as it was to big
1,No size stated in info.  Returned because it didn't fit.
1,I used to LOVE CW-X pants, but the quality of them keeps on sinking. They no longer come with a gusset in the crotch area, and the fabric along the seam in the crotch area did not hold up from any movement that is not a typical running stride. If I could return these guys I would, as the fabric failed after only a couple months, and they are not nearly as comfortable as their earlier versions. I think I might be forced to abandon the brand. I have about 8 pairs of CW-X pants, shorts, and capris, and over the last year or newer models are just not as good. Why would the brand get rid of gusseting in women's pants?
1,I bought these as a back up to my Fitbit Charge but they do not fit.  Ugh!
1,i thought it was cool looking but it didn't fit me at all and was a little uncomfortable so i sold it to a friend and he loves it.
1,Scope sighted in great after nine shots I had one inch groups. I shot 90 rounds at 50yds out to 100yds. At 100yds I started to adjust the scope and found that the turrets were "free wheeling". There was no way to adjust the scope. I have sent a inquiry to Truglo. The scope has a Lifetime warranty. I haven't heard back from Truglo, I hope they honor the warranty.	My gun is a S&W 15 Sport ll and I was shooting Federal .556 rounds.	I probably have the same problem as other reviewers, the set screws are gone. I hope that is the only problem.
1,This trampoline bent pretty much immediately (within a week of setting it up). I would not recommend it.
1,way too small
1,Product not what I expected.  Vest is way too small.  Ended up not using it.
1,I originally really liked these but now after having used them a bit more, I'm left pretty disappointed.  If you're not using these to run poles off downriggers, they are perfectly fine and an amazing deal at this price.  However, these are NOT strong enough to hold rods that are off a downrigger.  The white tension knob and teeth to hold it in a semi-upright position aren't strong enough to hold and after a few minutes, your rod will slam down to a horizontal position or worse, nose down as it tries to dump your rod into the drink.  I almost lost a rod because of this.	Now I have holes in the boat with this base mount secured and I'm trying to find another holder (Scotty?) that can be used with the base plate.  Another option is to epoxy the snot out of the teeth and tensioner and permanently keep it in a semi-upright position.	In short, these are great if you're only planning on fishing the surface dragging lures.  These are NOT to be used if you're running downriggers with any sort of tension at all.
1,Just purchased this pack , took it on a small trip as a carry on , and its falling apart . A lot of loose threads that get caught in the zipper and the zipper jumps the tracks a lot. tried getting ahold of the company to get it replaced, had no response. Your on your own with this one
1,I was putting this together and it was simple enough.  The adjustments are easy and overall I was pleased.		I placed my mountain bike in the set up and I was using this on a regular basis when the stand broke from the force placed on the two plastic guide holders located at the handles.		I believe it isn't made for everyday use or long term use.~maybe I got a faulty one, who knows
1,This worked well  with one very important exception: I could not get the handle to stay firmly in place. That threw me off as I was "walking", from side to side, so it was impossible to read and even pretty hard to watch movies or television.		My super tried to tighten the screws at the bottom -- the housing simply would not fit, and we even tried stronger bolts. That snapped the housing.		Bottom line: too flimsy to stand firm even with professional help and tools.		Junk here.		Robert C. Ross	May 2017
1,Wore 5 times during walks and runs. Already developed a tear/hole at the seam on backside of one of the sleeves. Disappointed this happened... they worked well but the quality is questionable...
1,Junk. Front sight never did work right from the beginning. would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Very frustrating as we are heading to the Mountain and went to load the bags for the first time ever only to find the main zipper not working (zips but doesn't zip). Amazon is already sending a new one, but hopefully the mfg gets the message. Price as good though for a style I don't think anyone else likes.
1,I thought they sounded cool. They are gathering dust as we speak
1,The compass does not work when it is on the bracelet. The fire starter is not so great either. I would recommend you pass on buying this product. The light is bright and would be good if it faced forward to see maps and stuff you are holding in your hand.
1,I tried various ways to apply this to my various masks.  Don't waste your money, just spit into your mask.
1,These do not fit the b-square Marlin 336 rifle mount sold here on Amazon.  Don't buy them.
1,These are much thicker than the original pads.  The thickness of course affects the fit of the helmet, and now the helmet is too tight.  Avoid these pads at all cost.
1,This product shouldn't be sold in the market.  It's cheaply made and hurts the nose.  Don't buy please.  It leaves terrible marks and doesn't do it's job.
1,This product didn't do at all what I wanted it to do. I initially bought it so after I wash my hats, it will dry on the shaper preventing "lumping" and wrinkles from forming in my hats. The product doesn't fill or form out the hat which when my hat dries it still has lumps and wrinkles. This product is useless to me. You get what you pay for lol.
1,I have a special needs son who loves to work out on this Reflex Bag. He actually is very good at it, but through regular use (correct use, not abuse), two problems developed with the product. First, the pole which attaches the bag to the base stretched at the joining spot of bag and pole and ultimately gave way with the bag sailing across the room. The metal actually expanded and bag became loose. I ordered a replacement pole from Everlast. After regaining use, the plastic anchor of the pole to the base (the water filled bottom) broke completely. There are 3 moving pieces to this devise and 2 have broken with use. Unfortunate, as this is a great way for my son to work out. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who plans to use it regularly.
1,It doesn't grip the rail well.  I have a Sig 320 and when you try to tighten it, is shifts on the rail so it isn't straight.  Very disappointing.
1,fine if you plan on tumbling your cases multiple times but other brands of case lube do not require being washed off.
1,not easy to use, not accurate
1,This tool stripped my spoke nipples. Would not recomend.
1,Received it one of the drilled and tapped screw receivers you're not complete had to return it waiting for the new one
1,There is no way to stop the water from coming out the top.  Most of these I have owned had a pop-up water spout that allowed you to store it in the closed position.  This one leaked all over my shoes...
1,Not very comfortable.  Not nearly thick enough, I thought it had said it was 3 inches thick but I would say its 1 1/2 when inflated.  It doesnt stop the hardness like other pads might, it packs up small which is nice.
1,I have the winter version in this size and it fits much better than the summer version. This liner is much tighter than I expected and did not fit well into my Bern Unlimited Lenox EPS Summer Helmet. It is still usable but not very comfortable. Since this came directly from Bern I was expecting consistency in size between liners and compatibility with Bern helmets. I would recommend going to a skate shop that sells this product and checking it out in person.
1,Pros:	1. Looks pretty.		Cons:	1. Not true to sizes. Too small. I wear shoes size 11 and ordered the XL (Size 11-13). They are very tight and uncomfortable once on.		2. Blades not the right size and shape. In the pool, I don't feel enough water resistance, and realize blades are thicker, shorter and much heavier than similar fins, hence reducing the maneuverability and effectiveness.		3. Too expensive, compared to other fins that do better jobs.		I bought the pair from Swim2000. The experience is horrible. The fins came in a USPS paper envelope, without any other packaging. The fins looked used when taking out of the paper envelope. Swim2000 customer services also suck. Better stay with Amazon.com LLC.		Here is the ranking of the five pairs of the swimming fins I have bought and tested recently:		1. Aqua Sphere Microfin Fitness Swim Fins, size: 11 - 12 (46-47) (4 stars)	2. Head Energy Swim Fin-Size 11-12 (4 stars)	3. Speedo Multicolored Short Blade Training Fin, XX-Large (3 stars)	4. FINIS Floating Fins, Black/Navy (Size: 11-13) (2 stars)	5. TYR SPORT EBP Burner Fin, X-Large (2 star)
1,Garbage.	The bottom of the PLASTIC level had to be sanded flat and leveled to get it to where it could even be tried.	Bad design, works on very few guns. Magnet is weak at best.	Not recommended, you can do better by eyeballing it.		The Wheeler Professional Reticle Leveling System is awesome and definitely worth the money, Highly Recommended.
1,I had high hopes for this knife but in reality after the first time using it it rusted.
1,Maybe a stadium chair but way to big for backpacking
1,Not happy. The 1st I order 3 they cam as the description said. The second time I order 4 they came with a Husqvarna logo on them. That was not in the description.
1,Toggle broke on first use. Otherwise, the stitching seems to be secure, but it's only as good as its weakest link.  Disappointing.
1,You get what you pay for with this cap. The quality is paper thin and the bill bends at the slightest touch. Sent mine back.
1,Zipper broke after 3 uses. Cheaply made. Stay away from this one.
1,looks like I'm wearing a big ole egg. not pretty... the ladies mock me.
1,I understand this was a cheap product, but I didn't think it would be this cheap material. The gloves are practically coming off within months of use.
1,This net is a nice idea but misses the mark a bit.  It is pretty flimsy and does not like to sit up straight.  Also, any little bit of wind will blow it over.  I wish that I had spent a bit more money and bought one of the larger ones.
1,They specify it will hold 25# of lead shot.  Each of the two bags I purchased WILL NOT hold 25# of lead shot.  If you pack one full, it will look like a balloon and they will NOT fit under the rails of my Lead Sled DFT.  I have a large magbum rifle and need as much weight as possible.  I'd be lucky to have a bit over 20# of lead using their bags.  The 25# canvas bags the lead shot came in will work just fine and they don't leak.  But, they will have to sit on the outside of the pan on either side of the rails.  The only way you could use these and allow them to lay in the tray as the DFT is made, is to probably only have over 15# of lead to keep the bag low enough to fit under the rails.  One could purchase the :"large" bag they make, but then you would only be able to place one bag with 25# under the rails.  It was a good idea and I wished it worked!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HOPPER!!! I just recently received this hopper on the mail thinking itwas going to work. And I only paid $7 so I was very happy. Well, when I held the hopper up to the Project Salvo, the hopper's bottom was way too big to fit onto the Project Salvo's hopper adjuster. I did some searching and I found that this hopper needs a part that hooks onto the hopper and the paintball marker. It also uses extra CO2 from the gun to move 6 paintballs around and down to the barrel. So, every time you pull the trigger, there is one paintball shot out and one reloaded. That is fine and all, but it costs almost $60! In the product description of the hopper, it said that it was "battle-ready". Well it's not, because you need another $60 item to have it work. I strongly advised you to stay away from this manufacturer, unless you have the money to spend the $60 to have it work.
1,The bottoms fit perfectly the top was way to small.  I wear a 34D in bra size and the size medium I ordered probably fits an A cup.
1,Light works well but fan doesn't put out much air circulation
1,Don't like the fit
1,25% of candy was not sealed! It was just really gross knowing you ate candy that was not sealed on the other end of the package.  Bare candy was everywhere in bag.  Really disappointed .
1,Pros: kind of okay in very dry conditions		cons: very slippery when wet!		I bought these pedals, hoping that they would grant me more grip on wet and technical trails, but if they get even slightly wet, you lose almost all of your grip. Even in dry conditions, your feet still slide around on the pedals. If your not doing any serious riding, these might be okay, but don't buy them if your planning on riding a lot of jumps and drops.
1,Can't tell the difference between the yellow or black sides.  Can't tell the difference between the Peltor plugs and cheap foam plugs.  Doesn't seem to be worth the money.
1,Easy to use but does not inflate mattress so it is firm and it lost air overnight.  Only used it twice.  I would return it if it wasn't too late to do so.
1,Bearings do not align properly with floating spacers maybe it would work better on 6mm spacers. if you have speed skates don't buy these.
1,Fabric feels slick, not a terry cloth like advertised.
1,I purchased this wood stock .22 Benjamin Marauder, July 3, 2015 with high hopes after digesting everything I could find on the Internet about it. I went into this not blind to the fact that these Crosman PCP air rifles have a tarnished reputation when it comes to accuracy (often referred to as the barrel lottery), but in my defense, I thought how bad could it really be.		I placed the order online through another supplier because to be quite honest, I got a better deal buying a package that Amazon doesn't offer.		When the .22 Marauder, pump, extra magazines and pellets I ordered arrived, I immediately unboxed everything and conducted a general inspection. The first things I noticed where, the bolt handle had pierced the two inner boxes and almost the outside box, also I observed the barrel shroud was canted up towards the top of the barrel band.		I proceeded to slowly fill the rifle with the hand pump only pumping 40 stokes at a time and letting the pump cool down between sets. I lost count of how many it exactly took to fill the rifle to 3000psi, but it was over 200 strokes for sure. The pressure gauge on the rifle and the gauge on the pump did not correspond with each other, the rifle showed 3000psi, the pump 2800psi. I contacted the supplier and Crosman customer service and its a known issue, I was instructed to fill by the rifle gauge.		So I mounted my optics and proceeded to shoot from a bench rest to zero and see what all the talk about PCP rifles is all about. I knew before hand that the rifle has a reputation for being pellet finicky, so I had 7 different types of pellets to try.		I zeroed the scope as best I could determine and started shooting groups. Nothing seemed to be very good, some where better then others, but 1.5-1.75" @ 20yds is pretty much what some of my .22 spring air rifles shoot at 1/5th the cost. I again contacted the supplier and Crosman this time about the accuracy and they offered some suggestions to try, but said that it should shoot at least dime size groups @ 20yds.		I went over the rifle with a fine tooth comb, changed the scope, cleaned the barrel and tried again. For all this bench shooting, I was filling the PCP via a SCUBA tank instead of the hand pump. I tried again and the groups tightened up about .25", but still unsatisfactory. I moved the target out to 33yds and the groups opened up even more, to 3" this time.		So I called the supplier back and asked for an exchange and started everything again a week later with rifle #2. I received the replacement MROD and ths time the fill cap was loose in the box, I heard something rattling around before I even opened the box and thought that can't be good.		I filled the rifle and the gauge was 100 psi off in the opposite direction from the first rifle I had. First rifle gauge showed 3000 psi and my hand pump gauge showed 2800 psi, I have the same hand pump and the new rifle gauge shows 2900 psi with the pump gauge showing 3000 psi. I've been filling this rifle to 3000 psi on the pump now.		Put the scope on and proceeded to zero, groups looked like a shotgun pattern. Chrono the rifle and its shooting about 50 FPS slower then the first one. Put 170 pellets through it and had to throw the BS flag. It shoots worse then the first rifle I had. Groups if you can even call them that are 2.25"-3" @ 20yds, I thought I might see them tighten up a little after 100 pellets, but no such luck, even the JSBs shot 1.75"@20yds.		I proceed to go over the rifle and come to find out the pellet heads are not even engaging the rifling, there are no rifling marks at all on any of the various pellet heads, so I've got a very oversized barrel on rifle #2. I call the supplier and arrangements are made for rifle #3 to be sent.		A week later rifle #3 shows up and I start the process all over again. I unpacking and noticed the rifle I received was previously opened and it did not come in the brown outer box as before. To make my anxiety even worse I noticed the barrel shroud is not centered in the band, it is closer on the left side, so that wasn't looking promising either. Also there are obvious tooling marks clearly visible under the finish of the shroud between the band and the muzzle, very poor quality finish.		Mounted the scope and bipod, filled with the SCUBA setup and the gauge looked spot on, that was a refreshing change I thought, but that was soon short lived.		The zero was pretty close to the last rifle so I didn't have to adjust very much. I shot 40 pellets and the pressure went from 3000psi down to 2000 psi as expected. I didn't bring out the chrony, so I don't know what the fps was. I refilled and started trying some different pellets, shot another 40 pellets and this rifle definitely doesn't like the JSBs, which both of the previous 2 rifles favored.		I go to look at the pressure and it's showing zero, but the rifle definitely still has air pressure. Apparently the face of the gauge has shifted 90 degrees, also the gauge is pressed hard against one side of the stock hole. I tried to finess the lens out and no luck.		I will say this much, right out of the box of the three rifles this one had the best accuracy so far (5/8"-1 3/4"@20), but it's still far from what I should be seeing. Of all the pellets I tried, the CPD 14.3gr showed the most promise at 5/8" groups with rifle #3. I feel like if I had all three rifles, maybe I could make one good one. I figured I would look the rifle over and clean the barrel to see if anything could be improved, but the next day I found that the air had leaked out of the rifle overnight. So I've got a broken gauge and an air leak, I didn't see any point in wasting any more time or pellets on this rifle.		I called the supplier back and it was agreed this just wasn't working out for me, so I sent everything back (minus the pellets), for a refund. I estimate between consumables and some other dedicated PCP items I wasted 2 months of my time and around $200 to gain this education. I also asked the supplier about the box being opened and was told it was inspected before shipping. I'm not sure what to think about that or what it was inspected for, but obviously this rifle had problems.		Some other things worth mentioning is the rifle is fairly heavy, unbalanced and very unwieldy. If you are thinking about walk hunting with it, carrying it at the ready will get old very quick. I found myself carrying it right shoulder arms quite often. A padded sling would be a worthy investment, but I never got around to putting one on since I was having so many other issues.		I actually liked the 10rd rotary magazine. I thought it functioned well and I didn't see any difference in accuracy between using the magazines or hand loading. With 40 useable shots on a factory tune and 3000psi fill, 4 magazines seem like the perfect amount to carry. Also the chronograph records 10 shot strings, so you don't have to reload or change magazines to shoot a full shot string on the chrony.		I shot all 3 rifles out of the box without adjusting the trigger settings or adjusting the tunes. That would have come later if I had received a rifle I thought I could work with. The triggers were not too bad, I actually liked the first rifles trigger the best, all three had a different feel. Rifle #3 had quite a bit of trigger creep before it broke.		The Gen2 Marauders now have a factory depinger installed in the air chamber, but the shooter still hears quite a ping. I'm not sure how audible that ping is standing away from the rifle when it's fired, I didn't get a chance to test that. I will say I was pleasantly surprised with how low the muzzle report is. That is probably one of the best things about the marauders design, the integrated barrel shroud ages it very quiet.		What's the moral of this review? As of August 8, 2015 the Gen2 Benjamin Marauders in .22 cal. still have serious barrel issues resulting in poor accuracy. The rifle pressure gauges are also flawed. Many airgun forums have numerous posts about the accuracy problems and refer to it as the "barrel lottery". In 3 tries I wasn't lucky enough to get a winner, so buyer beware. Even though the Marauder has some fine qualities, if the barrels are so bad that the accuracy is affected so much resulting in poor accuracy, then what's the point? One star for such poor accuracy.		If you do decide to go ahead and purchase a .22 Marauder, I suggest you shoot it immediately and make sure you are completely satisfied with it before the warranty period expires. Best of luck to you.
1,Just did not care for the fit-returned it.
1,Blade quickly rusted even though I dried it thoroughly after washing.  Mechanism is too tight.  Doesn't open and close easily enough.  Very bulky for pocket, but good size for picnic basket or backpack I suppose.  Arrives nice and sharp.
1,This product is not worth the money.  The plastic bonnet that holds the cover does not last.  Broke after one season.  Will rig some up myself.
1,To be honest, no. The knurling is just dots painted over and smooth it's longer than the old bar I had but doesn't weigh 45 pounds. It was like 39 pounds. I use it as spare for now. It just basically looks cool cause it's all black. I went to ironmaster.com and bought a bar there. It weighs exactly 45 pounds and the knurling is amazing. It's more expensive then this bar but man it's worth every penny. I actually can back ironmaster more than anything else cause I bought a few of their products. Like the Dumbbells they have, best purchase I ever made! Better and durable than any other I've ever had. Pay for quality.
1,I'll give them two stars because they fit me well and they are nice liners.  However, the entire point of buying them was for the touchscreen feature and THEY DO NOT WORK THAT WAY.  Total disappointment!
1,1.5mm is really light, might be 1.5mm but seems less dense than neoprene than my wetsuit sleeves. End effect is the neoprene stretches too much and any amount of stretch creates holes at the stitching. This makes the glued seams inconsequential as water readily enters through the needle holes. I am use to wetsuits and understand that they will let in water and that the way they keep you warm is by your body warming the water inside the suit but when cold water enters in volume through the seams it flushes out the warmed water and you get cold. Per title, sizing was correct with chart, could possibly have gone with smaller size for real wetsuit fit, (tight). So unfortunately I'll be returning and looking for something else.
1,product seems good but they're too long, not large. the heel part fits around my ankle.
1,Not really worth the money. Came in a nice box, but that is about it!
1,...apparently you only get 1 mat. Why would anyone order or need just 1 mat? This is after reading a question that was asked about how many mats per order. Another person answered 2 mats.
1,Way too small for my husband's mouth. I could see it fitting a child.
1,Terrible product for an adult.  I tried several times but its just too small for an adult mouth size.  Fits my kid although not very well.  She doesnt use it.
1,My wife bought this for me as a birthday present. Good watch, good GPS communication, terrible and I mean TERRIBLE heart rate monitor
1,It's too small, bad stitches in comparison to anther brand being sold on Amazon
1,Everything is as expected except for the broken torque driver. The instructions say do not set the driver above 80 in-lb. John Li calibrated it to 82.8. The thing free wheels. I suggest only buying only the lapping set without the torque driver. That's a waste of money.
1,I love the feel of this mat, and it's definitely good quality, but I find it slippery
1,Lasted less than a month.  Wish they would fix that little plastic piece at the end of the clip.
1,Sadly pretty much worthless. Instructions clearly show visible out to 100 yards. But when I first tried at 25 yards it wasn't even visible. Couldn't see it it past 25 feet in the day.	Secondly the build quality is a joke. Battery caddy will fall out at the slightest bump.	Look for a better product. Sightmark is selling a very poor practical joke with this,
1,Not very sturdy and the lack of a valve cover is the reason I don't use this except in the sauna.  Do not buy.
1,Got my 10 year old a medium but it was way too big on both the waist & length. I guess I'm gonna have to save it for next year or the year after that  all in all the pants look great just not true to size.
1,Nosepiece uncomfortable and shifty. Reflective nosepiece arms reflect light inside of lens defeating polarized concept. Not well made/thought of.
1,I was so excited to see a good priced light at 1200 lumens for purchased, with nice options that come with the light for myself, but then, I regret the purchase.		I've purchased similar lights in the past from Geoman, at 650 lumens. I also purchased lights from Blitzu and GoPal at 900 lumens. Now, let's compared them side-by-side.		Pros:	- Well constructed.	- Good battery capacity.	- Great replacement rubber bands for handlebars, helmet, and mounts.	- A small little tail light as a bonus. Not worth having, but a good bonus to have.	- Nice boxed package. Very well protected for shipment.	- Love the power indicator when it's turned on, with indicator of how much power is remaining.	- Love the option of fast and slow flashing level for daytime travel.	- Love the LED power indicator will only turn on when the light turns on. This saves so much power in the long run without having to unplug the light.		Cons:	** Lumen rating is extremely over exaggerated. 1200 lumens?! I wish.		** At 10ft of light projection in total darkness, angled down to the ground:	- This light creates a spot lamp, 3ft wide, at the highest level, no brighter than the 600 lumens of all our older lights. What's the purpose of this small little spot light? The rest of our other older lights create a nice equal flood at 10ft across.	- A massive blur halo at 100 lumens scattered in a diameter of 15ft. What's this halo for? What's the purpose if we can't use this light to see what's at the side of us? Our older units provide an additional 5ft hard halo at half the lumens at max illumination. With that much illumination, we can see things to the side of us.		** At 25ft of light projection in total darkness, angled down to the ground:	- This light creates a spot lamp, 5ft wide, at the highest level, no brighter than the 350 lumens of all our older lights. What's the purpose of this spot light if it can't provide long beam with the same intensity?	- A massive blur halo scattered without a purpose. The light is nothing but a distraction.	- There's no way in hell I will use this light going down hill faster than 10 mph. I will out run this lamp capacity at the highest setting. My older lights can easily handle up to 35ft, covering the entire area quite easily, and they all light up the ground with great illumination for all of us to see.		Summary:	- Rather than just returning it, we'll keep it as a backup light for our friends that join us for a fun night ride. The person with this light will be in the center, while the rest of us with the older, lower lumen lights, will take point and be at the rear to light up the paths. During summer time, I'll use this light as a secondary lamp as a commuting light, while my second light will be used for night time homebound travel. During winter, I'm not relying on this lamp for my own personal safety. We'll be focusing on purchasing GoPal from here on out. It sucks to purchase a light without a battery level power indicator, but I rather have a true lumen lights than an over exaggerated one.
1,It's a great idea but the this fell apart with in a few months.
1,Wooden shaft breaks the second you put the slightest bit of pressure on them.  Best used as kindling for your fire.
1,It may be the world's strongest spray, I have no idea. I never was brave enough to get sprayed by it. But I can tell you it is useless by its expiration date. I had a can, my wife had a can, and I kept a larger can of the green spray in the house for protection. When all three expired I decided to take them outside to empty the cans before disposing of them. NO PRESSURE. Just a little dribble came out. Each was within a month of expiring, so it's not like I had overly expired units. Outside of these units, I have had Sabre that still had full pressure past its expiration. They may be powerful, but I just can't trust my life on them. I sincerely hope those who buy these or already own them have great luck. I just can't risk it again.
1,Works 95% of the time, thats not good enough
1,Cheap knock offs ! But they work
1,Arrived on time but only got the front half of the case, no back.
1,Not as well made as the Lewis and Clark Pouch.  Skip this bag.  The L&C pouch lasted over years years but this bag failed the first time.
1,The moment I openned the package the wheels began off gasing, which smelled like fresh asphalt. I had to store the cart outside for a year and wheels still smelled. Also, be very carefull to adjust the foam pads to avoid scratching a composite kayak, which is difficult to do. Overall, I cannot recommend this product.
1,Poor bearing movement...felt like sand in the bearings.
1,This product was a total waste of money. It would not roll on - was literally as hard as candle wax. Putting it in a warm place before trying to apply made no difference - still hard, most uncomfortable to apply (pulled at my skin)..
1,Go to the Speedo website. They put cheap suits on Amazon and pass it off as a speedo this suit faded in color after a month sagging and bagging. This is the second suit I ordered from Amazon. I reordered through speedo much better quality. Sorry Amazon normaly products are great but not this time..		Kelly Miller
1,I ordered this for my teenager. The shirt seems well made. Unfortunately, this is a YOUTH tee. They could have made that a little more clear.		Thankfully, it will fit my yonger son.
1,I bought it for my airsoft AR thinking it would work but no, I cant use it outside. It's ok for the price but I ended up using my EoTech because its the only thing that works. I know it is not a good comparison but my point is that you can't go cheap on optics and win.  The scope itself seems well built and looks cool and works in low light but the second you go outside the dots disappear completely.
1,Cheap version of military hats.
1,I got a medium like I wear in all running shorts, but these are SOOO tight. I don't even know if I could do a squat in them.
1,motherf*ggin' tip broke off on the FIRST USE! And yes I was using it correctly, and had the correct size nose on the tool when it snapped off inside my bike! maybe I just got the unlucky weakling out of the bunch because I know Park Tools are pretty much all I ever hear about being used lately...
1,Lock wouldn't  open after on use junk
1,Granted, I tried to buy the cheapest shuffler I could find for one of our poker players who had a hard time when he was the dealer. Figured I couldn't go wrong with a product with the Bicycle brand. I was wrong. With a fresh 9 v battery the machine's left side  mechanism  was frozen. It was assembled (In China, go figure) with the left card moving device jammed against the card platform. I turned it upside down and loosened the dozen or so screws and actually got the mechanism to move. But the cards all jammed ~ every time, during the shuffle. If I put 1/4 of the deck on each side of the machine, I got it to work ~ sometimes. Again, you get what you pay for. The silver lining was the amazing and simple procedure amazon laid out to return it. Hope they burn it. Can I give it no star?  Ps~ Really? Anyone liked this product? Really?
1,NOT what is pictured	no fabric cabinets under	super super thin aluminum with plastic hardware	no carry case.\\		returning.	word
1,Didn't like these at all! They are way small and they don't stretch in the waist like normal leggings. Returned them!
1,I ordered the Canteen but there was no bottle! It was made in India and the Sewing was very bad! The cotton thread was old and rotten! Do not buy this product! It's a rip-off!
1,Too big don't ware them
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,CHEAP LOOKING and CHEAPLY MADE,WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER FROM THIS MANUFACTURE
1,I was planning a 650 mile bicycle tour and wanted a bright, reliable tail light for the tour. I had read good reviews about the Princeton Tec Swerve and purchased one for the tour. A week before leaving I put it on the bike with one of the heavy duty o-rings it came with. Mounting it to my seatpost was easy and it felt secure. I turned on the light and positioned the bike so that I could walk down the street and observe the light during nighttime conditions. The brightness of the Swerve was impressive! A friend was also doing this tour and having seen my light purchased one for himself. A few days later we started the tour and after only a few miles of riding, we noted that both our lights were off. Cycling the switches turned the lights back on, but they would again turn themselves off after a few miles. After the day's riding we checked the placement of the batteries, and finally replaced the batteries, just in case that those that came with the units were defective. Changing the batteries with new ones made no difference; the result was the same. It appears that the lights are not very shock resistant and do not handle bumps in the road well. Needless to say this was very frustrating to discover at the onset of the trip. We also discovered that the batteries did not last nearly as long as advertised. They lasted about ten hours in flash mode as opposed to the advertised seventy hours. Finally I encountered rain during a two hour period one morning and after the rain, I discovered that my light would not turn off, regardless of switch position! I opened the light and drained a small amount of water from the light's interior. The rubber gasket was intact, placed properly, and the unit was snapped firmly shut, and yet water still got in.		In sum I would say that the Princeton Tec Swerve's brightness is great. It needs to be more reliable and more water resistant. The battery life is ok, but not nearly as long as advertised. With its turning off by itself and lack of water resistance, I cannot recommend this light.
1,These running capris are exactly as specified. I am 5'6" and wear a size 8. I  ordered a M, so the sizing is fine, even a little roomy. They are incredibly cute and look exactly like the picture. They are comfortable.  However, these capris are so thin, that they leave no bulge or movement to the imagination. I run in a lot of races. I would not want anyone to see what I look like from behind. They would be fine if you are working out at home. Needless to say, I work out in public and these pants are going back.
1,Not durable at all. After 7 times using them in cross country F3 workouts they have already developed three holes in areas that never make contact  with any surface. Wont buy them again, too expensive to wear out/ deteriorate this soon. Velcro straps fail to attach. Over waste of money to but these. Better off buying neoprene disposable since these are only for looks.
1,I purchased these gloves because I liked the idea of slip on gloves with no velcro and because it had high ratings.  However, these gloves did not meet my expectations.  It was very hard to put on and take off and the location of the weights (top of hand) just did not feel right.  I felt a little "off balance" when punching and for some strange reason, the top of my hand felt very weird (tingly feeling).  I went back to using my old gloves until I can find something else to replace them with.  Also, the material looks like it's going to tear soon.
1,This is my 6th pair of leggings from 90 degrees. This particular pair I'm really disappointed in. I think it got mislabeled or something- I wear a large... this is most certainly not a large. I was excited because these were 10$ where as all the other pairs I've paid between &15-$20 for...  Not to happy this time around.	If they did fit like all the others I would have been ecstatic because the colors are super cute. As usual the material is amazing and they aren't see through... someone will find them at goodwill and be happy with them.
1,I have no idea if this is good or not because all I received was a coupe steps and a bunch of poles. No instructions, no screws to assemble it. Will be returning. I'm sure if you actually get all the pieces it's great.
1,These are thin and not supportive compression shorts at all. They feel cheap, like Under Armour is using less material to save money. Under Armour used to make compression shorts that were thick and durable. They used to feel like they were supportive and high quality. These are not that.
1,wont sight in
1,its not even close to what I was expecting.
1,too small for much use
1,Lens is NOT clear, it has a mirrored, green tinted sun screen film on it; this is not appropriate for indoor swimming. It had fogged by 200 yards of swimming in an 83 degree indoor pool. Field of vision is diminished by the design to the point of making it difficult to judge flip (racing) turns, and obviating the view of your competition in an adjacent lane or your companion in a shared training lane. It is very comfortable on your face and did not leak. I have 67 years of competitive swimming experience and would not judge this goggle appropriate for a competitive swimmer.
1,Its ok for the price.  My biggest complaint is the smell of the molded handle is terrible and causes your hands to smell as well.  Smells like gasoline.  I hope its safe for your skin.
1,This doorway sit-up bar is very rickety.  After fastening the handlebar to the door mount with wing-nut & bolt provided, only one or two sit-ups can be done before the bolt loosens making the unit wobbly & unstable.
1,ive medium size male hands and this handles both too short plus not wide enough for me to get a real tight grip on it . plus if i ever had to defend with it ide be concerned my hand would slide up off handle onto blade becauses handles smoothe and theres zero blade guard featured . i cant back this item !
1,Weak performance in Florida salt water. Lasts only a few weeks before allowing barnacles to grow profusely.
1,The bag is a bit smaller than I anticipated but this is no fault of the item as the dimensions were clearly stated in the description.	Super cheap material and the zippers in the front are horrible, not sure where all the great reviews are coming from.	This bag is definitely not worth the price.
1,Work as intended, just an awkward shape.
1,since I can not get an answer on when made, I will have to pass.
1,Used them once and they bent.
1,1.  The light wasn't as bright as claimed. I sent a request for an exchange (within the return window)...no response.	2.  The strobe function started to fail. Then the light eventually stopped working. I only used this light a handful of times since I don't ride in the dark much. But I would have liked to feel more confident in the road when I do. SAFETY HAZARD if you ask me. I sent a request for a refund...it was declined because it was outside the return window.  Seriously?  Not satisfied customer at all. Request Amazon to review the vendor's practices and products.
1,This product is made very small.  Very thin and feels like you have nylons on.  I thought there would be a little cotton in them,  guess not.	Your wife might like them for nylon stockings
1,Not well made. Cheap squeeze bottle nozzle.
1,Ok, I am  a collector like many of you and own both this knife and the crkt minimalist (bowie). Though this cost half as much I was dissapointed by comparison as the CRKT is at least 3 times better.	Ok out the box shave test CRKT -smooth as babies bum, MTECH not so much in fact no shave. Sheath CRKT smooth, silent, secure MTECH, rattely, noisy, but relatively secure. Grip, although the 3 finger grooves are similar the CRKT grooves feel much better plus it has gimmping on back of blade for some thumb purchase where the MTECH is smooth. The handle scales CRKT are beautiful with that braided faub MTECH scales don't exactly match up some slight over hang here and there.	The MTECH has the smoke color finish that to me makes it look even cheaper. If you are considering this over the CRKT to save a little $ DON'T ! get the CRKT. As I said before I collect so I've got many types & styles of knives so naturally I'll like some more than others for various reasons, but this one has not earned a spot in collection.
1,Work's fine however I had to use some duct tape to keep the phone in place a piece was missing,seller should had known about this.
1,Cheap plastic. The harness clip broke on it within the first couple hours of wearing it over my shoulder. Now, I have to carry it. Sucks for me.
1,This is NO Smartwiool! Yes, its a fraction of the cost of the real think and I got what I paid for(which is crap). I will use this like the smitten for shower gel you can get from the Dollar store for a $1. PS: the size is one size too large.
1,Simply will not stay on my nose.  It's a typical nose, it's snot like I have a beak or something strange on my face.  The Cressi DF 200189 does.  So, this one is going into the junk drawer.  The carrying box is nice, so 2 stars.
1,Very wide.
1,I had high hopes for this singlet, sadly it fell short.		I purchased a size large.		I purchased it for my daughter who normally wears a size large (5'6" tall, 155 lbs) singlet. This item was so small she couldn't even get it above her bottom.		We gave it to a team mate who is normally a size small (5'5" tall, 105 lbs), it fit her nicely. HOWEVER the singlet is see threw. :-(		The tag came off while trying it on so we can't return it.
1,Who's mouth are these supposed to fit? A toddler? They are completely worthless. Save your money.
1,yall I thought this was junk would not stay on reel spin caster or baitcaster I only got it cause I thought it was a prize gift when I bought the kastking reel  I won't use it and not happy with this product
1,Will NOT fit 1 1/4 inch rail. Description was vague on size. Built well but did not fit my application.
1,I bought this for my daughter to take to summer camps. It was just for one week and several parts of the water pouch turned nasty coloring. It was only used for water. The spot nozzle lever also broke, rendering it useless.
1,Extremely short.  I bought this for a wooden baseball bat and it wrapped up about 5" before I ran out.  Needs to be at least 50% longer.
1,Runs extremely small. Order at least one size up
1,This volleyball is not appropriate for middle/high school play (and above). It bounces WAY too much-it is not a typical volleyball. I was lured by the price, but I can only say this would be good for younger kids playing volleyball. I should have known by price. I coach my daughter's jr high team, and I only let the girls use this ball as a last resort.
1,I received my CSX in October and really liked it.  I was going to write a reviews early but thought I would wait and really give it a test.  I walk 1-2 hours six days a week and will his 2,000 miles this year.  Last week the numbers started  fading so bought new batteries and put them in.  It worked great for a couple of days and then it was just like before unreadable.  Right now I am wearing the CSX and my Omron and the CSX is unreadable. I will buy another pedometer, but never a CSX!!!!!  Very disappointe!!!
1,I found these are designed so they ride extremely low (way too low) around the waist.  Besides, one of the three had a small rip right out of the box and the product was returned.  The quality of the product was otherwise quite good.  You just need to know that these are designed to ride very low and you may not like this look or feel.  This is not the best effort from Under Armour.
1,Ash makes terrible mags but the gun is great, tried multiple. Very disappointing
1,While my feet never smell like roses, these socks seem to amplify and project my foot odor considerably more efficiently than any other sock I've ever worn.  They're comfortable, they seem very sturdy, but I could fell a rhinoceros at 100 paces just by taking my shoes off after a day in these.
1,The pump broke the very first time that I used it.  Nice concept but at the end of the day, the one time that I needed it, it didn't work.
1,Asian sizes are waaaay different than USA sizes. I knew this going in but didn't realize just how small these are. After reading the questions and reviews, I went up a few sizes and ordered 3XL for my hubs who's an avid cyclist and goes thru cycling shorts faster than - well - just let's say we buy a lot of cycling shorts. I wanted to try and save some bucks, but this definitely was a mistake.  He's normally an XL with a 38' waist, but these 3XL bib shorts wouldn't even come up his thigh. Great shipping by the company and easy returns so bit kudos in that regard.
1,This gun was my first over 100$ gun. Let me start by saying this,DO NOT BUY.It is simple mine broke very quickly and i still to this day don't know whats wrong with it, then the motor popped out. POPPED OUT. i didn't even know that was possible. anyways why are you still reading this you should be looking for much better guns by now.go on.
1,The ends pop off
1,Hard to grip and hard to position in many locations. I  concluded I needed a proper torque wrench kit after all.
1,i didn't think it was as little when i bought it, could really cast it even with a decent weight. couldn't  find a weight that fit it, weights were either too light and did nothing, or too heavy an made it drag and stick to the bottom
1,There made of plastic but should stand up to range duty.  The kit doesn't come with enough bolts to mount everything, just look at the picture and count the bolts!  Yep that's right 12 holes but only 8 bolts in the kit!  Hmmm that's pretty bad math tapco.
1,don't like the item, wouldn't fit my weapons at all, so i made a nice belt.
1,Had a pair, sent back for refund.	Not low profile enough. Everyone knows the secret to being operator is lo-pro all the way. When you're out in the field at zero dark thirty low crawling up to some hadji's hut to bust a 9-banger in his front door, these just get in the way. They catch on everything and the extra peripheral vision is annoying. I mean, who needs to see to the sides when the target is in front of you?	They're also way to heavy- I found it hard to hold my head up on extended ops.	Trust me, in a few years all the real operators will have moved on and these things will be selling on the streets for a dime a dozen because of all the shortcomings- I can't even list half of them here because such intimate knowledge of these devices is a national security issue.	1 out of 10, would not buy.
1,geat
1,The pump worked great for about 2 months and now	runs for about 2 minutes and then quits.  I would	recommend finding another alternative to distribute your	barrel water.
1,The rod does not go very deeply into the wood and is not very well secured.  The wood got a crack in it, and the rod fell out easily.  I repaired mine by putting super glue in the hole, putting the rod back in, and then letting it cure while held in a vice.  Seems to stay together again now.  Overall, it's not a very robust design.
1,Purchased this scope to replace the iron sights on my 9mm carbine rifle. Iron sights always dead on at 25 yards so nothing wrong with my rifle. Thought a red dot might be easier to see. On a 12x16 target hits were all over the target but could never get this scope to zero in one place. Looked like I was shooting a shotgun instead of a rifle. Red dot was not clear as well. More like a starburst instead of a dot at all power levels. After about 70 rounds I gave up and re-installed my iron sights. Now back to punching half dollar size groups with my old eyes. Would not recommend this scope for any purpose. Returned for refund.
1,the delivery took for a long time about 4 weeks. This is the bad designed bait. Never buy like this again
1,These might be good in slippers or just to wear around, but they are took thick to add to shoes. And they feel weird.
1,I had high hopes for this game because we have a pool, and I'm always looking for outdoor games for the kids.  First of all, the two rings that come with the game are doubled up in the box so that it fits (think figure 8, then flattened).  So when you try to lay the ring on your lawn, it just twists and curls up.  We put some rocks around the rings to try to get them to be flat, but then I was afraid that would tear up the dart bases.		The darts are a nice size, but when you toss them, even with control, they bounce and jump everywhere.  Remember the Weeble Wobble toys?  These darts are based on the same principle, with the weighted bottom. They don't land where you throw them.  My girls were done with these darts pretty quickly.  I was thinking that I could make a target out of a blue tarp to try and get some use out of the darts.
1,Very thin and Smallll really small couldn't fit my 6 year old niece no joke seriously i couldn't believe not worth the money.
1,Jams 100% of the time. Dubious value. Unless you like clearing jams and you want to learn what "slide bite" means. Expensive. Cannot be dry-fired without jamming. Why did I buy these? Just set fire to a $20 bill to get the same effect. This is one of those life lessons, I think. You do not need these.
1,Purchased this for a road bike. Never got a chance to mount the computer. As one reviewer previously stated, "IT'S TOO FRAGILE!" Install is easy, but you cannot tighten this thing. It sucks, and once it cracks, it's done. Try something different. Will be returning this thing.
1,Not what I expected.  I returned them.
1,Tested this baby yesterday: I'm giving it two stars instead of one because what happened was my fault.  The product description says "All metal spinning airgun target."  Don't do what I did and try to push it to the next level.  The SZT (for short) literally got blown away my first hit with 9mm 115 grain FMJ factory rounds at 15 feet.  The relative thin steel in the circular targets was deeply cratered and warped ... and the frame bent and welds failed after a few more hits.  Even when imbedded in the ground as far as possible, the whole shebang got blasted up out of the ground and 2 to 3 feet backward in a crumpled heap on several occasions.  Bottom line: I imagine the SZT is fine for BBs or airsoft or pellets ... but I won't guess whether it can handle .22LR.  Oh well ... the old saying is true: You get what you pay for!!
1,I would avoid this brand of blanket. Mine arrived today with multiple small orange spots spread diffusely through out the blanket. Maybe rust spots? Otherwise the blanket seemed nice.
1,The pellets look good in the tin, but they don't shoot very well in my Airforce Condor .25.  I shot these, the Polymag Predators and JSB Exacts and the JSB were the most consistent.  If you are using these in my Condor and attempted to hunt small game, you will not place all shots on target if shooting at 40-50 yards.  Photo 1 is the H&N Baracuda, 2 is the Polymag and 3 is the JSB.  All were from a rest in this order at 45 yards.
1,The thing just isn't sensitive enough. The kids (6 and 9) are clearly hitting it right, yet all you hear is 'oops - steady' over and over. I even tried it. You have to smash thing the down to register. Someone else posted about modifying it with glue to make the thing actually register, I'll have to try that.
1,Really cool . Bought two. They worked great for 6 mos and then nothing happens on either when you pull the trigger. This apparently is a common problem . If they fixed that these would sell like hot cakes.
1,Decent looking but the design leaves it slightly wobbly and I can only imagine how terrible it would be after repeated use.  Instead of having true holes and connected with bolts or screws it has opted for easy assembly.  You twist the screws in but the screws only tighten down to touch not latch the connected pieces.  If you do 20 or so situps once a month you will probably do good.  Use it every day like myself and it will last no time.  Returned for refund.
1,Hard to reload, the stock weights more than the gun itself im almost positive. I have used .12gram bbs and they can only hit a target at 75 feet, which did not go through a paper target. The sights are high up so aim lower. I have yet to try heavier bbs which will make it more accurate but with less distance. Makes the wierdest and loudest noise when shot. Has a differebt curve on each shot after a month of use.
1,the basket was hard to get on and off and then broke
1,Let me preface with the fact that I collect Camillus and KA BAR knives and military bayonets, etc. I ordered this knife because it had a good price and I wanted to add it my collection. I have two other (1980's) knives in this style by Camillus. The Ontario Survival U.S. Military Issue knife is in a word, crap. It's not worth $40.00. The sheath had a red price tag on it-partially removed. I removed the rest of the tag but a gob of glue remains. Not sure how I will remove that without damaging the finish. The picture on Amazon did not show a red price tag on the sheath. (Why did it have a price tag? Suggests this is a used knife). Next, the knife handle is crap. It is stacked leather with the first and last leather unevenly cut. The leathers are untreated. I can fix that with carnauba wax and Beeswax but why does the customer have to do that?	Next, the knife will not go into the sheath all the way. About one half inch of blade sticks above the sheath pocket. Also, The sheath is not built to account for the knife guard. The guard pushes against the leather sheath distorting the shape of the sheath and marking it with a heavy imprint. The knife blade itself has a crappy finish--ugly--and it has longitudinal scratches caused by the sheath. The finish on the knife is some kind of cheap paint--also ugly. The edge of the blade was made by a grinding wheel leaving obvious grind marks.	Broken strap snap: The strap that holds the sharpening stone in its pouch does not close. A close look at the snap reveals part of it is missing. It may have broken off when installed. Do they have any inspectors at the plant, I wonder. I'll have to go to Tandy for a repair job. Is this knife a "seconds" or returned knife? Either way, this knife is a waste of time and money.	I did not know KA BAR made a model,(I cannot find it on Amazon). I will search again for the KA BAR. The vintage Camillus is a superior knife over the Ontario brand. Look around before you buy. This one is grossly overpriced. It's a ten dollar knife.
1,Nice design, horrible execution. Parts fit poorly, bottom holder is canted leaving large section of unburnt wax reducing burn time by half. Only fit a very select size of tealight.
1,Did not hold pressure. Sold the lantern and kept the case. I bought a older green one at a yard sale it works good and holds pressure. Fits in the case.
1,Moroless
1,Cam had dents all around it.
1,Much smaller than expected. Order the med/large, but feels like a small. Drawstring won't close all the way.
1,Please do yourself (or your loved one/friend) a big favor and don't buy this thing.		First off, let's point out the fact that this so called, "core of your emergency bag" contains only two (knife and firesteel) of the five mandatory/core survival items (Cutting device, Container, Cover (shelter), Combustion device, Cordage). So by omitting the cover/shelter and container it leaves the buyer unprepared for the two most immediate and common survival threats- hypothermia and dehydration. The bracelet, with only 11 ft of cord tightly knotted up, barely counts as cordage.		Second, the axe is comically useless and actually even dysfunctional. The manufacturer, apparently in an effort to cut costs by using less material, designed the body of the blade so thin and uniform that it can't split wood much thicker than a couple inches diameter. It is not even as good for splitting wood as a large knife, that you could at least baton with. This however, since the end of the axe past the head is slanted back to the poll, has no place to strike it to pound it through the length of a log you're splitting. And if that wasn't enough you also can't even use it as a hammer, since the poll is tapered to a point. For what reason, I do not know, probably the same reason it has a cross symbol pointlessly punched through the blade.		So, overall, this essentially is a $140 item that contains about $30 worth of stuff, little of which is even among the most important core survival/apocalypse items. It is marketed at people who don't know better, try not to be one of them.
1,they fell off the first time I rode with them
1,I'm still trying to experiment with these but so far it doesn't taste lil real scrambled eggs or eggs period. Has an odd taste. My family could only describe it like a little sulfur, lil from a match. I'll try it a few more times different ways but so far, I'm sticking with egg beaters liquid or real eggs.
1,Notice how in the picture where the model is carrying the bag from the back you can totally see the mat? That's not because they didn't cinch the bag all the way. The bag IS cinched all the way. It doesn't close any further than that. I think a mat bag should close all the way. Would it really have increased the cost of manufacturing this bag by THAT much had they added 2 more inches of fabric??? I read another review that said the same thing. I wish I had listened...
1,Don't know how well it works, but the spraying mechanism stopped working after the first boot.  Opened the bottle and finished the job with a paint brush.
1,JUNK - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!		WOULD TAKE TOO MUCH EFFORT TO WRITE OUT 'ALL' THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS.		JUST A WARNING... IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT, GO AHEAD AND WASTE YOUR MONEY TOO!
1,was told these would work with an NAA .32acp mag, but don't ... however, can be sanded down to work with a P-32 mag
1,Cheap plastic. Not built well.
1,This mount was a lot more flimsy than I thought it would be.  It just didn't fit my skull well.  I bought it for a whitetail (140" class) but it didn't fit well.  I tried it with a couple of bigger mule deer thinking it might just be the deer I was trying to use it on but they didn't fit any better.  The price seemed good and it does have some flexibility of the angle of the head but not as much as I wanted.  I ended up returning it on the basis of I just couldn't trust it to hold my skull.  It felt like it would fall if someone slammed the door and I could not take that chance.  I did go to their website and watch the video instructions so I know I was doing it correctly.	I went back to the skull hooker as I have a couple of those already and they work great with lots of flexibility.
1,Too big for Maglite AA's;  too small for C & D cell flashlights.  If it's designed for a specific brand, that's not indicated. A good idea badly done.  A quasi-fraud sell, actually.
1,Light works nice but the metal part does not hold up to a marine environment After a year they all pitted. They look terrible now
1,Does not fit an Olympic bar properly. Good luck removing it after it is attached! I had to hammer it off. If u need to remove it for different barbell exercises DO NOT BUY. If u place it permanently on your barbell then it does its job. Negative stars for the made in China unbearable smell of the handles. This thing is junk and I hardly give negative reviews.
1,i can not turn down the flame, when I set it on the low I still high and burns everything you cook.do not buy.
1,Bought this seat base to add to my crestliner boat. Used it for a month, which equated to 7 fishing outings and the weld broke in the center holding the rod that goes into the hole. I weigh 210lbs and baby everything in my boat. Thankfully im a welder so I will fix it and weld over all the bad welds on it. Very dissapointed
1,Very poorly made. It's so weak it keeps jiggling as I try to use it. Can barely cut open packages. Don't recommend
1,Cheap and plastic looking. Too shiny. Not as shown in the photo. Hopefully I can sand some of the shine off. Terrible quality for 56.00 bucks....:-(
1,I ordered small, since I have small men's hands (if I was to order female gloves I take medium or large), I almost couldn't get them on, I handed them to my wife (who has really narrow and thin hand) and she got them just OK... so go for large size if you have a small hand.		Regarding the glove itself:	- it has no straps between the fingers to pull it off, you have to peel it off.	- it has big filling patches on the palms (I didn't get to use it, but it felt as if you would have large pieces of rubber between the glove and the handlebar, I'm used to silicone or rubber gloves, but the ones I used before were more natural)	- no velcro closing strap and it fits just on the edge of the palm (I like the strap, so I can get it on easily and strap it harder if the road is bumpier, also I like to have the wrist base covered)
1,Holy crap! This line is extremely stiff. I honestly wouldnt spool this on anything, but a bait caster. If you want a good copolymer line that is limper I would look at Gamma Polyflex. Mine came horribly twisted on the spool and was wrapping around itself and tangling before putting it on a reel. It is very abrasion resistant, but there are better options out there.
1,Got it today and very disappointed even the first look...extremely small and it should "ONLY" be for a kid for carrying small stuffs and not even good for school stuffs like binders or big books/text books. I'm not sure how they come up with these measurements (Compartment:17.7"x9.4"x4.7", Secondary Compartment: 15.7"x7.8"x2.75"), but I don't think it's correct because based on the seams, it has 16"x8 3/4"x4 3/4" and 14/1/2"x7 1/2"x 2 1/2".
1,These are loaded with heavy fragrance and I cannot wear them, even after sunning them for two days in a row.
1,Horrible taste
1,Looks good but way too big to do anything.  Photo and realty don't match. Better to buy a hooded sweatshirt instead
1,Not impressed
1,This blanket claimed 100% pure wool. IT IS NOT!!! When it arrived it said on the package 90% wool plus 10% of some other material.	For me, I SPECIFICALLY purchased it looking for 100% wool as it claimed it was.
1,I don't know i can't seem to get this to work. I will have to try again, but so far I'm glad I wasn't depending on it
1,These sunglasses are nice quality but i had to return them because they were so big on my face (& for some reason the right lense tended to fog up).  I don't consider myself to have a very small face but got these because people were complaining that the Suncloud pair I really wanted, was too small, so maybe I will try those after all.
1,ordered xl and fits like small
1,I got shipped a boot leg piece of junk. Not a real product and sketchy as all heck.
1,I am a survivalist by heart.. When they placed me on disability I've been homeless for over 10 years I live in extreme environments and mellow as well.. I live an travel throughout the United States.. there are some good points about this tent it is a weekend warrior tent.. long range impossible.. the problem I had with this tent was the polls are too thin and very frail they break so easy when the pole broke it punctured the body not good if your in rain conditions like Portland and Seattle Washington
1,Unfortunately these waders won't last throughout the season, unless you go fishing few times a year. I was able to get 15-20 outings, max. I went through three pairs of these waders and they all leaked after a little while. What I do love is the customer services Caddis provides and their exchange policy. They will replace them if there is something wrong but you can't get your money back. I think the warranty is good for a year. I really like the look and the feel of these waders but I haven't had a pair that lasts longer than one year. I went to another brand for a little bit of more money and hopefully they will last longer.
1,Does not leak my butt! This thing will leak from day 1.
1,Returned! Poor quality. The compass was not working.
1,Did not make it past 200 rounds before breaking the point off. Disappointed in the hardiness of this tool
1,Why did you choose this rating?	Most uncomfortable ankle holster I have ever worn.		What did you like or dislike?	Like: I love the Fobus holster itself.  Easy to draw from.	Dislike:  The thick cuff and velcro band combo has no give what so ever.  If I kneel down, it's like having a splint on my ankle, no give.  The thick cuff also rides on top of my ankle bone, this doesn't really feel that great either.  I usually wear low cut shoes and my ankle holsters ride kind of low.		Who would I recomend this to?	No one.  If you had extemely fat ankles you might be able to wear this comfortably.  I still would not recommend trying to kneel down though.
1,I have seen similar in a store, however this was different. Arrived dried out...fell apart and does not hold together to form shapes.
1,initially like the size of the bottle but then noticed how fragile they are when I went to close the top with the palm of my hand and the entire plunger mechanism broke and fell inside the bottle.		I would recommend a higher quality plastic.		Also the black color makes the water warmer faster.
1,It was obvious that the item I received had been sold, returned and then sold as new again. It was obvious before even opening the package that everything was just jammed into the package. The item was missing internal packaging, the battery compartment door was missing. Whoever placed this item in the box to ship it either had to be blind or just plain didn't care that the item was obviously damaged/missing parts. Worked out for the best tho, as I spent more money on a much better product - the Shooting Chrony Beta Master. Skip this one and check out the Shooting Chrony models, they are made of metal and much better quality.
1,Too difficult to get on/off without zipped legs and sleeves. Velcro constantly sticks to inside surface.
1,it is not working. Too bad that I opened it too late so the return due is missed....
1,Used this on my Trek Domane AL2 road bike. After a couple weeks the kickstand kept slipping and no matter how hard i tightened it it still kept slipping out of place making it near useless. Returned.
1,not for the boot
1,It is just what I needed to stuff into the front of my kayak, but after a year the thing leaks the melted ice.  There's nothing ripped as far as I can see, and I haven't treated it any rougher than a piece of gear is supposed to withstand.
1,The title basically said it all. This did what it was supposed to do except that it was easy to accidentally reset and when it got knocked off once, it died. I upgraded to something more robust. It may have cost 2x as much, but it has lasted longer
1,This product is a joke save your money and spend on something name brand.  The size runs way too small by 2 sizes if not 3.
1,Product plastics ring for the 22 caliber cracking.
1,Wow. Somehow the company felt compelled to punch two holes in the lower half of the flag for the one grommet...that was actually missing.  Print is nice though.
1,I was more curious than anything about a $100.00 scope.. Great as a Paper Weight
1,For a 4 xl it fits like a 2xl,to small really
1,These are quite possibly the worst baseball pants my kids have ever worn. The only plus on these pants is that they look good on- otherwise I would give 0 stars if I could. We LOVE Under Armour in our family, but seriously do not buy these pants unless you want to go through several pairs in one season! Here is why:		The material on these pants is so thin that unless your kid never slides or dives for balls, it's inevitable that they're going to rip. We had holes in the knees after MAYBE six wears. What a waste! Stains also do not come out very easily from these pants.		I hope you found this review helpful. If you did, please click the YES button! Thank you!
1,This is pitiful that I even have to write a review. I had better confidence in Amazon.	This $15.00 piece of junk won't even fit on my Mossburg 500 12 gauge shotgun, Not to mention it is constructed of a cheap grade of plastic.	The green luminous optical is missing before I even opened the package, probably laying on the floor somewhere at Amazon.		I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this product, I had higher expectations that you would at least send a complete unit.		This is trash and I want my account credited back for the amount charged. DDG
1,Do NOT waste your money on this cheap piece of plastic. I used it twice before it broke due to the wind blowing over two snowboards. So a fall less than 4 feet was enough to crack the corner located by the entry part for the cable. That offer course was enough for the cable to come out.		So if someone wanted to, all they'd have to do is smash the plastic piece nearest the cable lock and they have access to your property. I'm going to look for something more secure than this.
1,Laser was not working on some of items
1,I have owned this tent for a little over a year now (purchased June of 2011).  I have been extremely happy with the tent!  It's spacious and relatively easy to setup, as most domes are.  Due to the size,  having a helper does make things a lot easier, especially if there is a breeze.  Any large tent can be challenging in a wind.  Up to this point, it was everything I was hoping for in a large tent.  However, during my most recent camp trip we began to experience a failure in the zipper for the door.  I was shocked and disappointed as this tent is only a little over a year old and has been used less than a dozen times.  I have never had such a failure before.  I have another brand tent that is over 12 years old and is still working fine.  The size just doesn't suit my needs at this time.  The tent is technically out of warranty (it's only 1 year).  I have written Coleman to see what can be done about this, whether they will stand by their product even out of warranty, or if they will give me a reasonable 'fix' for it.  If they do not offer a cost effective repair or replacement, then I will be buying another tent and it will NOT be a Coleman.  I hope they stand behind their product.  I will update my review based on what I hear back from them.  If not for this failure I would have given this tent 5 stars.  For now it will have to settle for 2.		Update- as of today, 9-2-12 (a week later) I have heard nothing back from Coleman.  I may have to just try and call.  At this point I think I will either only buy another Coleman tent if I can get it at Costco (their return policy is awesome!) or I'll go with another brand entirely.  Too bad, I liked the tent otherwise.  There is a different model that has a "door".  Perhaps this would last longer than the zipper only door.
1,Very heavy, not really portable and poor design. It works great as a grill for an apartment or vacation home but theres no way you can carry this around easily. Im only keeping it because I got it on Prime Day for $89 if I paid full price I would have UPS pick it up. Its a huge box and pretty heavy.
1,This was advertised as an outdoor shower. It does not have enough room or a bottom like some of the other showers. It will work fine as a portable bathroom but not enough room for even a dressing room.
1,It is the best thing ever to get me across campus quickly. Probably some of the best money I've ever spent on wheeled transportation. Do keep in mind, it's a lot harder to tote around relative to a skateboard or smaller scooter. Also, as with every Razor I've ever had, the wheels get extremely loud and squeaky. The other issue is that the locking mechanism jiggles and makes the thing sound like a jingly toy.		I don't mind being the "scooter" guy, but when I go by, everyone looks. To see where the loud, annoying squeaking is coming from. I cleaned out my bearings, which was the consensus issue that people think is the problem, but it did not fix it. Also, I previously had a much smaller razor scooter, and it soon began squeaking, much like this one, and a few weeks later, the back wheel ripped. They also don't sell replacement wheels for this scooter on the Razor website. This makes it hard for me to continue as a customer of Razor.
1,Worked OK for a week but the straw leaked and you sucked a lot of air..  Contacted Kor and they said that they had a new batch of straws.  They sent me a new one for free and it didn't leak.  But, now it's so noisy that people across the room can hear it.  I've tried everything that I could think of to remedy it, checked other posts and contacted Kor again.  No response.  Not a good sign.  Another water bottle relegated to the back of the closet.  I've also seen them in discount stores marked down 75%.  Another bad sign.
1,Lasted 10 pulls or so before they stated to weaken.  Pull was not what I expected.  Not much harder to pull than the stock rubbers I got with my slingshot.  Changed them back to the original ones real quick.
1,the little thingy that is suppose to drop under the ball, doesn't.  you have to flip it around to catch the ball under the thingy which stays on the top of the ball.  the shaft bent the first time i used it.  Oh, well.
1,No instructions and I can't get it to inflate with the included pump.
1,This is going back to amazon.		I purchase one of these each year as I wear them out with 6.5 mile runs, 4-6x times per week.  I run a lot, and have been a loyal user, but the new version that states that it expands up to 4x, is garbage.		And while I don't know if they release only one version a year, I know I have the versions I purchased at the beginning of 2013 and beginning of 2014.		The early 2014 Amphipod version holds my Galaxy S5 and is taut, and the backing of the belt is a foamy, thick weave.  And that foamy thick weave is not just cushion and barrier, but also kept the sweat from getting on my phone while I run.		The new version I just purchased a week ago in 2015, does away with 4 features present on 2013 and early 2014 versions:		1st. The dayglow stripe that used to exist on the older version and go all around the belt is gone.		2nd. The front and rear part of the belt pocket is now made entirely of the super thin mesh material that expands not by stretching but by unfolding! So it will never hold anything taut and even my Galaxy S5 flies around this thing after it unfolds like a wallet and spills its guts.		3rd. The new superthin mesh allows not just moisture from your back or anywhere else to get on your phone, but its so thin that you can fully operate your phone's touchscreen by sliding your fingers across the largely see-through mesh on the backside of the belt.  That means that your hot back can also rub and operate your sweaty phone.		4th.  The separator that existed inside the pouch that I used to separate my house key from the phone is gone.  The pouch is one big semitransparent bag.		They need to get rid of the reviews given for this belt before they changed it so drastically.  Its not the same product by a mile.
1,These items are cheap, light weight and not good quality.  Spend the extra few dollars and buy a wood one with horse hair.
1,Hmm.  Maybe I am the only one here who had this problem, but this product doesn't mention that it is a non-standard interface.  You have to have a certain kind of seat post... that kind of seat post is not stated here in the product.  I am ok buying a new seat post too (both my seat and post were stolen) and I knw the dimentions of my bike I need the post to fit into but I can't find the type/size of seatpost  I need anywhere in the technical description of this product.  Just simple stating it would have been a big help and avoided a surprise... even now with product in hand I feel a bit lost about what to do next.  maybe all other buyers were not replacing stole seat/post combinations and instead just seats so they didn't have this problem, but when it comes to buying online the most important thing to me is "how do I know it will work with MY bike" and this product doesn't answer that question for me
1,I filled this about 80% full incase of an earthquake. About a week after I filled it up I noticed a weird smell in my closet. There was a pin hole leak and the carpet of my closet was ruined. So I tossed this out. I am sure it is a good product, I just got a dud.
1,Ordered a 3x. Shirt had a 3x tag but it was no bigger than a large. Took forever to get here. Shipped from China. Garbage
1,Scam!
1,Didn't fit well.
1,1.  this thing will not fit an OS handbar diameter	2.  tube sprung a leak and there is NO way to replace the air line	3  the air bottle needs to be kept in a bottle cage .... gee, where am I going to put my water bottle ?		Zound, fix #1 above and make it fit OS handlebars with washers to fit down to regular sized bars ...not too difficult to engineer		Zound, come out with a model that DOES NOT require the air line.... fit the horn directly onto the air bottle so that we can just install the dang thing wholesale onto the handlebar horizontally or vertically.... we need our bottle cages		Otherwise.... this is a LOUD horn.... the 1 star are for its LOUDNESS.... it failed on other points		Its a great product ..... make it a FANTASTIC product Zound
1,I was disappointed. After reading reviews, I thought these would be okay for basic compass teaching skills and they were not. They are way to small for kids to read and just don't work the greatest
1,This is made of plastic and makes my wrist sweat and it only registers when my arm is in movement.  Went back to using my pedometer.  But I do like being able to check my pulse/heart rate.  I use it more as a work watch as I can read the time easier.  It was not worth the money.
1,The size of this is not really for youth.  Perhaps it was intended for youth mouth sizes, however it seems larger than the others we bought.
1,Basic seat. Almost no padding. Minor imperfection during manufacture but not enough to return. Worth 13 bucks. UPDATE  Sept 2015. After about three months the cover cracked in numerous spots. Other reviewers said the same thing. See Photo. Returned to Amazon and they gave me store credit back, minus a restocking fee. DON'T BUY.
1,My husband bought this for a camp out trying to get equipment that would serve him for both car camping and backpacking.  We have always liked Thermarest. This pad was comfortable as it inflates to a good 3 inches, however, it was VERY LOUD!!!!!  Every time he moved it was like someone was wringing out a roll of bubble wrap or crushing a bag of potato chips!  Needless to say, he was not Mr. Popular the next morning when other campers asked why he was crinkling paper all night.  This is a comfortable pad if you do not move at all, and you are camping alone.  Otherwise you will wake up in the morning with no friends.
1,Very poor design and durability.  However, it is the only strap available in black.  Mine seems to break every year.  I am very lucky that I have not lost my very expensive Japanese watch.  The plastic band breaks without showing a crack or wear.  I am surprised that Suunto has not designed a better replacement.  The poor strap design is reason enough not to buy the watch.
1,I've used Tyr goggles before, but I've never had this problem. For some reason the manufacturer has added flaps on the sides of the goggles that enable the straps to come loose, and they do-- again and again. I set the strap at a length that works for me, only to have it come loose and require resetting. In addition, these goggles fog up terribly-- to the point that seeing where I'm going in a pool is not automatic. These goggles definitely need rethinking.
1,The black elastic band on these gloves rips with first use - usually right after I put the glove on.  I contacted the seller and got a "thanks", but no offer to satisfy me as a customer.  I'm very disappointed.
1,Music is awful--very boring video.
1,Nada!
1,crap!
1,Does not work well  even after warming engine up
1,Does not fit Shield. Does not look like the holster in picture. I have a Tagua IWB holster and it is my favorite. It fits my Shield like a glove. I thought this would be the same holster with a paddle. But, like the government, they took something that worked perfectly and screwed it up. It's really tight to get the shield in it and then it won't come out without pulling off the belt. Also the barrel protrudes about an inch below the holster.
1,Defective out of the box, goggles leaked around the gasket, gasket was defective.
1,Not a good fit.
1,This is a very cheaply made bi-pod from off shore and barely mounts to the barrel of my AK. I guess you get what you pay for!
1,worked for a few days and then stopped working.
1,Love my Glocks, but this Disassembly tool punch, not so much. I was disassembling my G26 to do a trigger polish job, and this tool bent (pressing out the Trigger pin), the very first time I used it. I strongly recommend purchasing two steel pin punches instead. A 3/32" pin punch for the smaller Locking block pin and Trigger housing pin, and a 1/8" pin punch for the larger Trigger pin. The Trigger pin took a whole lot more force to press out than I (and the Glock tool punch) expected. To replace my bent Glock tool, I purchased a "Dasco Pro 581 Carbon Steel Pin Punch, 3/32-Inch" and a "Dasco Pro 582 Carbon Steel Pin Punch, 1/8-Inch". I'm sure my Dasco pin punches will last a lifetime.
1,This item is an ingenious idea but unfortunately it ripped apart after washing it on gentle cycle. Oh my gosh I cannot believe that this happened and now we cannot use it. I was really happy with it at first and wanted to use it for a trip this weekend I even paid extra money to get it shipped by today. It is such a big mistake to have washed it thinking it would hold up? I don't think it's returnable.
1,***Update May 2015***	After a year and a half of casual wear the socket on the front snap closure has broken. Not really something I can fix. Rest of the shorts look practically brand new, but without the front closure they are useless. I know what you are thinking, and no hubby didn't gain a bunch of weight and bust out of them. Anyway, this defect is not acceptable on clothing that claims to be "rugged". I looked up their warranty online and it's only for 3 months. Disappointing, we've had $15 shorts from Target last longer and hold up better.		***Original Post***	He loves these shorts, to the point that they are the only ones he wants me to buy him. I like them because all the pockets means he carries his own stuff instead of trying to fit it in my cramped purse...
1,Adjustment know broke after initial adjustment.		I did receive full refund but it took some time.
1,This is about like looking through the bottom of a green beer bottle.  The zoom is minimal if at all.  The image quality is horrible.  If you have to have a night vision and can't afford the digiscope then this is your best bet.  However, don't expect miracles even with extra IR.  The ATN unit didn't even work when it arrived.  If this was all the money I had to spend then this one is better than the ATN in my opinion.  Although the ATN did not work when it arrived I can tell you the build quality of the Yukon felt much better.  It felt like a much more precision piece of equipment.  The Yukon is much heavier than the ATN.  Maybe that had something to do with it arriving in working order and the ATN arrived defective.  I gave 2 stars because it is functional and you can get a kill with it at really close range but overall I think the quality is REALLY bad.  You have a bubble in the middle where the image is fairly clear and then a ring around the outside that is nearly useless.  It's nothing like the videos and image samples they provide.  Don't expect miracles for a $400 night vision.
1,this product didn't work for me at all but the sleeve worked. everybody different you have to try what works.
1,I could not actually rate it.  I bought it either brand new or "refurbished", I forget which.  It was shipped without the cadence and speed sensor, so it was useless.  I would have been happy to have it, but I was so annoyed that I sent it back
1,These arrived quickly but the quality is poor at best. Most balls are damaged with scratches and logos are faded. If you order recycled golf balls, make sure you order quality Mint to AAA! I am a high handicapper and I was going to keep these but the more I examined each ball, I decided to send them back.
1,Average product. Not so great
1,I compared these side-by-side with Walmart bought Rapala scissors.		They are cheaper at Walmart. These only have seraded edges at the bottom of the blade. They are also made slighly different. I did a test. The upper half of the scissors don't cut braid well. Any older worn braid need to be cut at the seraded section.		The visible difference between the two different places are: walmart the brand Rapala is printed on the blade. On Amazon, the brand Rapala is poorly etched. Both came in different packaging. Walmart boughy have full setaded edges.		I uped it to Zing-It which is basically 500ish pound test dyneema (braided line is dyneema). They didn't cut without loading the scissors. With Walmart bought of this same product, no problem. Even at the forward/tip end of the blades.		Only reason for 1 star is hopes to spread this awareness. The scissors i got at walmart at better suited for braid.		However, the non seraded edge is grest for flourocarbon and mono. So these will work but aren't as good as walmart bought rapala braided scissors... save $2 and get these locally. These amazon bought are slightly different. Dont believe me, buy both.
1,Will pump a road bike tire up enough to get home (75 to 80 psi) but not up to a good running pressure of 95 to 100 psi.
1,I goofed and accidentally got this from a non-Prime Vendor - Lyons Trading Company, who did not stand behind the product!  The size chart is WAY OFF!	My numbers put me at the low end of "Large". As it turned out XL ( from a Prime vendor) just fits. Lyons would not pay for return shipping! What's worse - I paid extra for exoidited shipping, for a particular event and they were far too short and tight. ALL A WASTE OF MONEY!  They still sit in the ship back box.
1,This item ships from China, Quality is like the price "cheap" I would not buy again
1,I bought these for a friend because I lost a bet. He was happy until he used them. He broke 3 of them on the first round. My cheapo wooden tees can and will last longer. I do not recommend.
1,I liked this cap; it was lovely and wasn't too difficult to put on. I wore it one time and it hardly got wet, as I was in the toddler pool with my son. I went to put it on a week later and it ripped in half as I was putting it on. I'm sure this happens with all of them, I was just surprised after only wearing it once. I'll just have to buy several cheap ones and just replace as they rip. I couldn't find any reviewers offering tips on more durable ones/brands, so I'll just stick to anything around $5. I paid $9 for this one -- it was on sale from $19.
1,they did not even fit my Glock 42. was not what they said they were.
1,I bought one of these in a wholesale store a few years ago since the inside insulation liner is starting to wear out. Well, they have changed the material and this one is more of a "vinyl" type of canvas whereas the older one is more of a "cloth" type of canvas. I just didn't get the impression the newer material would hold up as long so I returned this.
1,It fell apart with the first use. went camping with this tent and three of the black loops used to stack it in the ground and tie ropes to, ripped off. Piece of junk!
1,The fire starter fell out after trying to use it the first time. Blade is pretty good though.
1,Do not plan on using this in a survival situation. I took these to a camp I direct in Aug and had them split into teams. I gave each team one of these and told them to use this and things they found around the forest to start a fire to boil a small tin can of water.		None of them got it going. After about 2 hours or shaving and striking, we ended us using Firesteel to get people started. It was terrible and we leaned that we never want to be in the woods with this item as our means of firestarter. Invest in the FireSteel instead.		http://www.amazon.com/Light-Fire-Swedish-FireSteel-Emergency/dp/B00440VIYY/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1410186361&sr=8-7&keywords=fire+starter
1,Got this REALLY cheap compared to the price on 8/20/2014.  Removed the linkage that prevents "de-cocking" the rifle--who would want to leave this rifle cocked when they don't want to fire it after loading?		Rifle is potent and very lightweight.		The trigger ruins it.  The adjustable trigger is a cheap afterthought that doesn't get you much--it's a flimsy plastic insert with a screw threading through it that is loose in the trigger assembly--the adjustment point moves so your second stage trigger will vary between shots, and it will suck on all of them...		The price was low enough that this is worth it.  Definitely not worth the $170+ unless the trigger is drastically improved.  The scope/accuracy can not be judged with the current trigger, unless you put it in a vice--I have not.
1,Originally rated four stars because the case has not yet traveled on a flight.  It seems to be good quality.  We did purchase a strap just as extra insurance that the case won't open in transit.		Update:  My husband packed his golf clubs in this case for a non-stop flight from Indiana to Nevada and back again.  The handle broke -- as well as one of the latches by the time he returned.  It was a good thing he had the extra strap securing the case.  I'm quite disappointed that the case did not hold up in its first use.
1,Quality is ok but not good! It does hold weights but I am not impressed with the quality.
1,Initially, I was unsure of how these were supposed to go on because they don't just wrap around but slip over your hands onto your wrists. They were very tight and small. But after I figured it out and used them a number of times, they have stretched out and now do not offer sufficient support. I would not buy these again.
1,I love lee products but it took Amazon a week to even ship it
1,Great quality but is either made for slim fit or size chart is way off.
1,It got a little messed up when my bike toppled over.  It was never the same after that and eventually came apart during a ride.  Didn't live long enough to actually be used.  The shipping also took FOREVER.
1,410 shells would not fit in it
1,The Coleman Griddle is pretty bad. At first glance you won't be able to tell that you've made a mistake with your purchase, you really wont. But after you use it a few times you'll come to realize that the griddle is not very good.		I purchased this griddle to take camping and loved that fact that it nestled inside the portable stove from Coleman. I was eager to use this to cook some omelets, fry some thinly sliced meat and cook some pork belly. Although the overall construction seems like it would last, the abysmal non-stick coating that Coleman decided to use on this overpriced hunk of aluminum is horrible. The eggs, stuck, the omelets got stuck and by the time the pork belly was on the griddle, this "non-stick" coating began to come off.		Didn't realize that the "non-stick" coating meant that the coating does not stick to the griddle. I really thought it meant that food would not stick to the pan. After washing the pan for the 2nd time, it looks like the photo you see here.
1,I love the idea, but does not work in the practice. The shims simply do not hold up to practical use and after only a few rounds, maybe 50, the shims are sheared and worthless. The bipod rattles around and is useless.
1,Junk junk junk.
1,Looks nice and all that, but it is pretty small.  It is better fitted for a kid's head.  It actually looked kind of ridiculous on my head.
1,One works OK.  The other (I ordered two) has something wrong with the mechanism that is supposed to keep the blade open once you have opened it.  This makes using the knife extremely dangerous.  My assumption is that the metal piece that is supposed to provide this safety measure is somehow bent or installed incorrectly but I just trashed the knife rather than try to fix it and have it fail again and cut off fingers.  Bottom line is that based on this experience I classify this as crap.  I am trashing the other one as well since I am afraid it also fail.	On the plus side they look really good and the blade (out of the box) is very sharp.  No idea how well or even if they will hold an edge.
1,the ends broke off
1,Somehow they changed the fit from the 17 and 18...very uncomfortable
1,Frame came bent.  Very sad for my son as it was his big birthday gift.  Don't buy!
1,I thought I'd splurge on a nice knife.	My ESEE-6 and RAT-7 are much stronger, have a finer finish and are less money.	Even the sheath sucks.
1,Does add a little cushion and length to my AR but didn't work well with the Command Arms cheek rest ordered at the same time.
1,Too small. Sent back. Uncomfortable
1,I tried several sizes but the arms were too small for me. Granted, I do have large arms... but I'm not The Hulk. It was too uncomfy so I had to return.		This review us for fit only, not performance. My husband has the men's model and loves his.
1,I ordered these, 2, based on previous experience with Vittoria Ziffiro Pro II, and reviews for Vittoria tires. They are probably great tires.....if I could get them on/off without busted knuckles and broken tire tools, not to mention the tool punctures in the tube. Worst tires for mounting I've ever delt with. OK. Maybe my rims are a mm larger than 700's ought be. IDK. I DO know that the V. Ziffiro Pro's folding are easy on/off and seem pretty puncture resistant.		Returned.
1,When got it a part of it was broke and the ax head was not even in the package. Now, not all of it was broke but the piece were it connected was. I rated it 2 stars because i sent it back not wanting to use it so i honestly have no idea how good it was.
1,Light weight, sometimes forget its there. Good app works with iphone 6. Don't use the PC/MAC software. Got it on sale. Syncs my steps with Virgin Pulse app that the company promotes.		Update: After Constant syncing issues with Virgin Pulse App (company sponsored) I will give this 1 star. Doesn't matter how accurate this thing is if it WONT SYNC!
1,I just received the bottle. However what all the reviews I have read forgot to mention, and what I didn't find on the description, is that if the strainer is taken out (which is what I like to do so that my tea doesn't become bitter), the bottle will leak hot liquids all over your hand. It will not seal without the strainer. If it wasn't for that design flaw, the bottle would be great. the handle and the slim design works well in your hand and in a car cup holder. Unfortunately I will be returning it and looking for something else where the strainer is removable.
1,Not winter yet but these gloves are too small.  XL usually Work,  but I wanted rrom liber for sub zero biking.  XXL s not even XL in other gloves.  Another revine stated The dame.  Do not they'll Last more than one season.
1,Fits horribly around the butt and crotch. These just don't fit as snug and natural as my other shorts. Wouldn't recommend.
1,I was super excited about getting this knife but I was very disappointed in the steel type. What you get does not match the picture.. It is not a 154cm steel and does not have a serial number.. Returned!
1,The shirt had holes in it out of the package i would give it 4  if i could wear it
1,I loved this thing when I first got it.  Pulled it out of its first year of storage to use again this summer and found that the windows were cracked and broken open from where it was folded and rolled into it's bag.  So whatever the window material is made out of, it's not meant to be creased in storage.  I will have to duct tape the windows in order to use this again unless they sell replacement windows.  I did like the venting at the top as well as the zippers not getting stuck.
1,Did not charge the fitbit charge hr at all. Sent back as defective.
1,This shade had too many parts and was not easy to put together.  I ended up returning it.
1,I ordered 2 smalls - which is my normal size for workout pants- at great Add-On deals, they were TINY, and had no stretch.  I could barely get them up half way up and couldn't even pull them up.  These are not women sizes because I wear size small for bottoms for all my workout wear and this one definitely has a different size chart.  Returned not right away.
1,Put these stuff on my gun sight charge is bright for a very short time. I wouldn't recommend it because it doesn't stay bright longer than 2min. This is from a 15 mins charge with a surefire light and I also sun-charge for 30min. Both times it didn't stay bright pass 2min. You could literally see the charge dieing out.  Hope this help some of you to make a better judgement.
1,Ripped in less than 3 months.  Would not buy again.  Guarantee appears to be no good. Customer service appears to be no good.  Will update rating if situation changes.  This describes my experience, i hope yours was grate.  It is not uncommon to get a defective product and a company can build a great reputation by promptly taking care of the situation.
1,isn't very stable... I should have paid more for a better product...
1,I have had the same results as a few others...I put this kickstand on my Trek Crossrip and it would not support the weight...The sand bent at the top where it inserts on the arm and my bike fell over...I threw the stand away
1,I received these mitts rather quick from Amazon but was very disappointed when I opened the package.  I noticed they were made of cheap material, the stitching was OK and the hand insert part was rather lose.  I'm going to have to return these mitts for better ones.
1,They weren't kidding when they said Never Flat. It's really firm and stays that way. It works so good I had to move the settings to "Plush" AND unplug it to keep it a little softer. I would give it 5 stars but the one thing I wish it had was a "remote" to deflate or inflate while I'm lying down. At first I liked not having to worry about that but I have to get up to turn the knob at the foot of the bed. I was placed on modified home bedrest so getting up every so often to adjust the firmness is not ideal. Other than that it has held up well even to my 3 toddlers at home.
1,Bad display.  The white on black display is simply unreadable in anything other than bright light.  Everything else about the watch seems pretty good.  I'm going to return this and try the traditional black on white display.
1,Guy will break your nose while you are installing on your hat. Even if on, the move would be easily telescoped to your advesary.
1,Super flimsy.
1,These gloves have a terrible chemical smell. Must be loaded with some sort of toxic substance compliments of Chinese manufaturing. I couldn't even store them in the house! Definitely avoid. Go with Venum - their gloves are exceptional - and no smell.
1,Received a lower cable, although photo and description says upper
1,One ripped when putting on... I measured to make sure I had the right size and  on the one that isn't ripped it feels like it gives pretty good compression... Disapointed that I basically paid 30$ for one sleeve since once ripped.
1,poor quality
1,Don't buy the SMALL size. I wasn't expecting it to be so tiny. My bike chain won't even fit in it, let alone my chain and lock, which is exactly what I need this for!! I was afraid medium or large would be too bulky and bang on my legs or rub the tires while riding so I ordered small. Why design something like this if it can barely hold a set of keys? Waste of money.
1,on 3/18/17 I used this rod for the 1st time. I was excited but when I finished and started to fold it to back, the very tip was very hard to push in, in fact when I put a full force to push it in, it bent.  I was very disappointed. I don't know if its my fault or factory defect but I am very disappointed because I was bragging about this rod.
1,Way too expensive for only 5 candles.  I can get 5 packs of these for a 7th of the price elsewhere.
1,I put this on my bike after fighting with the expansion nut that came stripped out. I got it fix up started down the street and it was slightly off center to I reached down to put it back over the center of the tire and it snapped in two. I'm not really sure if this was just a junk one from the start or not. The concept seems sound but the materials have to be able to hold up from the bike falling, light crashes. I would not have thought it would have broke with simple pressure from my hand.
1,The price and style was ideal but it ended at that. Did not fit well for my 7 1/2 new era hat size. I have an oval shaped head too. I also seen this helmet labeled for women at cycle shops in my city.
1,Put the pos on my son's 22, little if any movement in windage adjustment was available. Tried moving it on the mountain and reattaching it, still nothing. Windage mounting finally just stripped out the mounting threads and fell off.	Don't waste your time or money here, as the warrenty is also no good!
1,The ring around the top of the rod has come loose and as I am shooting teh rod moves through the ring and sticks out like a bayonet after about 60 shots.
1,I reviewed this product, as usual, prior to purchase. From the reviews I thought it might be a good buy-- WRONG-- this 'portable camp toilet' would be perfect for the kids or a N.Y. model weighing less than a 100lbs and for no one with a butt circumference larger than a saucer plate! I sent it packing back to Amazon which has an outstanding return policy. My advice, look at something, anything else (unless it's for the kids)!
1,Mine came fast but it doesn't have the sticker 59 fifty on front men..
1,The tip of the thumb has a plastic like cover which is too small for the tip of the thumb and the threads holding the cover in place irritate the thumb around the nail area. I use it for about ten minutes before having to remove it.
1,Looking for relief with tendonitis in both wrists purchased these wrists supports hoping they would help with pain.  Disappointed they offered little relief and returned.
1,Photos look great.  Alot of wind/blank photos.  Slow trigger time causes half shots of animals and blank photos.  Trigger time is the most important aspect to trail cams for me that is why a low rating for this one.
1,The upper "stainless" layer of this product rubbed off after about a week of use on a paracord watchband and started making a nasty rash on my wrist where it touched. I thought it might've just been me, but I had two other people try it for a few days and they got the same thing. The mating screws for the pin are also completely stripped even though I never torqued this down at all, so the pin like to slide out whenever it wants now. Do not buy.
1,Put this on my motorcycle helmet--price is way too much for what you get.  Next time I'll buy 3M tape from homedepot and just cut shapes I want.
1,***UPDATE 08/27/13*** I was initially pleased with the cue ball trainer but after 1 month of use, it began to crack. A split was developed  on the ball and now I have to downgrade this review to 2stars. The ball was never dropped or mishandled in any way.		As a terrible pool player, I bought a used pool table so I can play/practice at home. I purchased this training aid to improve my game. There is no guide or video that accompanies this item which I knew when purchasing. I figured there are PLENTY of YouTube videos for practicing tips. I'm diggin' the table and practice ball because I'm seeing my ball-striking mistakes and getting a better understanding ball reaction, spin, draw, follow, and English.
1,The Pad came on time and the packaging was good, the only problem was that once I peeled off the protection layer the adhesive for the pad was on the protection layer and not on the stomp pad rendering completely useless.
1,Came with immense vertical play. The spyderco logo in the handle looks like a piece of plastic that was glued into an oversized cutout. Didn't expect the knife to be so thin, it's scrawnier than the endura series, and even their byrd series. It not only looks cheap, it feels cheap. Doesn't even feel like FRN handles. I got my Native 5 out to compare with, and it feels nothing like the untextured parts of the lightweight native 5 scales. If I had to describe it in a few words, it's essentially a "ozark trail with higher quality steel". It feels nothing like a Spyderco. Gonna return this utter disgrace and get my $$ back.
1,Horrible trekking poles!!!!	They broke within 80 miles of hiking and I tried finding the website or customer service from jesban and there's no information to claim my 3yr. Warranty.... this is bs
1,Used it first time yesterday in Colorado. We did a short day hike and I was immediate bitten by mosquitos the moment I stopped walking. Ended up with at least 8 red bumps on legs even when I applied the lotion liberally twice during the day.		It doesn't look like it repels anything except my wallet. Will not buy again.
1,While i admit i didn't spend 3k on a device like my uncle i expected alot more from this. I couldn't see more than about 10 feet with partial light outside. Pitch black i could see nothing. It arrived the sun went down and i boxed it back up and it went back the next day.		Prop to amazon for the speedy return of the item and my refund however.
1,Bought as an extra guest bed. Went flat after the first night. From what I can tell it leaks from the inlet. Poor manufacturing.
1,First day, set up the bike, tried to pull the plastic/rubber strap around the tire and with minimum force, the plastic/rubber strap broke. It seems to weak. The rest seems ok. I would like to have the strap replaced, but there 1800 number is unreachable from my location.		Days later:  second strap broke.		Update: I was able to contact to them through email. The replacements arrived and work very well. Please do not pull on the rubber peace to tighten the tire and rim,  just use the first clip and go. It does not need to be very tight and it does not stretch.		As long as you don't stretch the plastic strap, the rack is perfect!		(updated to reflect status as of 6/12/13)
1,The nose bridge was too narrow and I had to return them, Very disappointed they didn't come with extra nose bridges of different length.  The eye pieces were very comfortable so I am disappointed to return!!!		Their customer service were very responsive and tried to assist!
1,Just arrived and am sending this bat back.  There is a fine crack running down the bat.  Pretty bat, but doesn't do any good if it comes cracked.  Wow, rather go to dicks and buy a bat.  Might pay $5 dollars more but you know what you are getting and quick.
1,I PURCHASED THE 9X9 TCU VERSION FROM RIVALRY. ALL THE HARDWARE WAS TO SHORT AND AFTER TWO WEEKS THE PRODUCT STARTED FALLING APART. SPENT ABOUT 3 HOURS TIGHENING ALL THE HARDWARE. COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME, SHORTLY AFTER THE PLASTIC HARDWARE MOUNTS CRACKED AND BROKE.ITS MY OPINION THAT MY CANOPY WAS DESIGNED TO FAIL. FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE MANUFACTURER. NO RESPONSE FROM RIVALS. $200 THIS COMPANY SCAMMED FROM ME. DO NOT PURCHASE!!
1,I chose this because I thought it would be convenient and quality.  I liked the idea of a case that would carry the grill and all the accessories - grill grates, tank adapter, etc.  Unfortunately, the quality is lacking and there's not a good way to stow the handle as far as I can tell.		The very first time I went to put the grill into the case, I noticed first it wouldn't fit.  Ok, so you have to remove the handle - no big deal right?  But there's no place to put the handle - it doesn't fit will in the external mesh pocket, which is better suited for the 20 lb tank adaper hose.  Not a huge deal and I could deal with that.		Unfortunately when I went to strap in the grill inside the case using the supplied straps, one of them broke.  I was lightly cinching down the lower velcro strap and it simply pulled out - came unstitched from the case, rendering it useless.  Not what I expected from what should be a heavy duty case.  Not worth the effort of sending it back, but this shouldn't happen.
1,Too small
1,I love skins, mainly for recovery, and have had them for over a year. I have 2 pairs of the last version and have ML sizes. Now, the ML size is so small that it hurts my waist after 30 mins and I can't wear them anymore because it hurts so much. So, from one version to the next, they changed something in the sizing and are to small, just an FYI.
1,Unnecessarily complicated. Froze after a week. Kept counting steps driving.
1,The product is made well but based on the cost, maybe a little too well!  I would pay $30 bucks for it but not a cent more.  Mounting the motor directly on the boat makes more sense and is more stable.  The only reason to purchase this is if you will be moving your motor from one boat to another.  Otherwise...skip it!
1,I know I have a big head, but these run small.  I can't hardly get it over my head.  For me it's a neck gaiter only.
1,I picked this up for my 16 year old who is into exercise.  There are no instructions but I thought it was just me and my husband and my son would know what to do this band.  So they explored the website and talked about the uses. In the end they felt it would be good for scraping things down in their trucks because they didn't like the product.
1,I purchased 2 pairs (a pink and a blue) for my 5 year old and 7 year old. The blue pair for my 7 year really bother him and he complains that make his eyes burn (and he's worn other goggles). I washed them and they seemed to be a little better. The pink pair will not stay tightened and become loose when my daughter is swimming. Since they become loose water gets in them and she gets annoyed and pulls them off. There is something completely wrong with this pair as we have had no problems with the blue ones coming loose.  I don't think I would buy them again.
1,Would not fit well on my Springfield. It is just a cheap piece of stamped thin metal. No way to make it flush against the front strap.	Threw it in the garbage.
1,Very cheap. Gas station quality glasses
1,Husband didn't like the fabric.  He felt it was hot and itchy.
1,SRAM power links are as good as they get - but this listing is totally inaccurate. I have received a single link twice now - once when I bought, another when I exchanged. The picture and description is for 4 links. One star due to the inaccurate description.
1,Not what I expected. I wish I bought it at Wally world so I could easily return it. Took it deer hunting to mask human scent and repel bugs. Although light weight, it takes up too much room in your pack. Ran it 2 hrs with no effect, then took at the deet which works better. Tried a new set of inserts, still didn't work. Then tried it to repel flies when our deer was hanging; that didn't work either. I prefer deet.
1,Both the gemstones popped out the first time I wore the rings; but I kind of expected that with the price. I still wear the bands when I go to the gym, golf, hang by the pool, etc. They're nice to wear as a replacement wedding band if you don't want to wear your real diamonds or solid bands.
1,makes my booty too big.
1,This watch stopped working in less than two months from purchase, and it is not due to a faulty or low battery.
1,CRAPPY ! jammed all three of my rifles and my brothers shotgun. it may be cheap  but don't even bother wasting your time. ITS CHEAP FOR A REASON
1,Horrible
1,its flimsy and the handle did not work,  do not recommend to anyone buying this, they could have built a better quality handle..
1,the lc9 and gun's in this family size will fit why to deep in the holster, making it hard to draw, and reholster
1,Works fine but has the durability of waxed paper.
1,mounting screws tightend right through the plastic shell holder , twisting right through the shell holder because holders made of such soft junk plastic . TOTAL JUNK !!
1,I put this on my Sig's contrast sights and there is no difference. The stuff just doesn't glow.
1,So these fit great and look pretty nice. I'm a little concerned about the length and the cold air going up the sleeve, but we will see. Ok, so I gave the 1st pair to my son and he is happy. I ordered a second pair for myself and they are bigger than the 1st pair. :/	While having a chance to wear them I have come to realize that the option of being able to to use you mr smart fone is a waste. Because the entire finger can activate the screen you can't text. So that's a useless option. It was only about 30 out and I was walking and my fingertips did get noticeably cold.	Ok so we have had some cold days the past week and these gloves are not very good. The cold goes right through them. Although better than no gloves you must still keeps you hands in your pockets. Sorts defeats the purpose.	All the zipper pull came off while trying to zip it up. Try a different brand these are poor.
1,the quality isn't what i expected, the grey wrist band had a pen making and the dark blue band's lettering looked sloppy. I was hoping for a clean product that is not what i got. i wouldn't recommend to anyone.
1,Got these to go see snow when we went to Mt Hood.  I wasn't sure on size because it didn't say but they were WAY too big for me.  I assume they are a mens.  And they didn't stay dry for long on the inside at all, even after tightening as much as possible.
1,Worked about three times and then died.
1,The white plastic bleeds into the black plastic with no clear definition of  lines. Very jagged plastic edges. No one took the time to trim the plastic. Not worth 2 dollars let alone $15. The plastic itself is very thin. The mounting bracket on the front is thin metal that bends very easily, so every time you hit a bump the front fender slams into the tire. Wife told me to remove them after 10 mins. cause the poor quality of the plastic (white mixed into the black) made her bike look worse.
1,I'm not able to comment on the reliability, because I've sold mine early on. I can tell you that mine was Japan movement, but cased in China.  Casio movement was very accurate.		The price in my opinion was way too high for this watch. Dial is sweet, but finish of the case(body), band & clasp seems OK at best at this price range.	Also, the full-size second hand on this watch is used only in the stopwatch mode. Seconds are displayed on the subsidiary dial(small dial at the bottom), so the whole time, big	orange hand is keeping perfectly still while the little hand at the bottom is ticking. It was odd to me, and anybody I showed the watch to.		For me, this watch is two stars for the price. Just below par.
1,I tested the spray and it is very weak. Real police grade pepper spray is 10 times hotter. This stuff will only anger an attacker.
1,BEWARE!! NOT FULL LENGTH HAND WRAPS!!!!!!!! These are 108 inches, not 180. You cannot fully wrap your hands with them unless you are a junior or have very small hands. They work fine if you modify the wrap, but will not offer the same measure of protection as a full 180 inch wrap. I find it perturbing that it says nowhere on the main description about the length. Very easy to look over, I would think.	There are three PAIRS, which is great. When it said 3 Pack Hand Wraps, I assumed there were simply three wraps, one for each hand and an extra.	They work well for me. I have not washed them yet, but I assume they are going to fray in the washing machine. That's why there are 3 pairs.	They do NOT hold up if you try to wrap very tightly. The velcro ripped right out of the seams the other day when I tried to wrap my knuckles for muy thai.	The price was a good deal and incredibly fast shipping from the seller. It shipped out one day and arrived for pickup the very next afternoon. Price is great, especially as these go for twice the price at a store like Dick's Sporting Goods.
1,Pretty inhappy with this setup. Battry dies pretty quick and the valve lights unscrew the guts from the valve stem when you take it off.
1,I would like to give this a higher review as it actualy functions well for a while. The big problem, as listed by other reviewers, is that the mechanism that clamps each side to each rear bolt, eventually won't let you tighten. This means the bike is barely in each side and the handle just spin without letting the female receptors advance on to the bolts on the bike. Mine has not come out yet, but I have also not been using it much as it is now warm outside and I can ride in this climate almost constantly. I fully anticipate the next use or two, the bike will fall out while in use. I plan to replace this with another brand as soon as I'm stuck indoors again on the bike.
1,These socks are too big for my feet, but too tight in the calves. I don't have large calves at all, so I was surprised at how tight they are. Also, the red stripe is extra cushion, which might be great for skiing- but just made an uncomfortable lump in my ski boot. I'll be returning them.
1,After 4 months of almost daily wear the velcro straps are in shreds and the 7y/o grandson is complaining of discomfort and that the wrist and elbow guards are too small. Looking for a better set.
1,I just received my 18 year old first bow and Christmas present today and he has not shot it yet but it not that impressive so far. I get the box with a bunch of lose parts in the box. After taken a look at what was there the arrow rest bolts are missing none of the accessories are attached to the bow. Not the big of a problem to attach them but I read on amazon  that some of the bows accessories  are assembled on the bow. Will up date quality at late date once shot.
1,Even after pumping up tire after small puncture, the tube does not stay sealed. Did allow my son to ride  mile home, but will need to replace tube.
1,Too small.  Very small for my size.  Sending back.
1,Bought browning dark ops, junk nite time pics, blurry, foggy looking  totally unacceptable
1,Save money and get a better one.  Falling apart.  At least could have glued panels to aluminum
1,Not at all what was promised.  I ordered gray and got black.  It said it had pockets to store cards and cash.  Its literally just a sleeve for a phone.  It also doesnt even allow you to hit the home button through the thick plastic front.  This thing feels like it mustve cost next to nothing to make, and I feel ripped off, despite only spending about $4 USD on it.  Thats how bad it is.
1,Product has great concept: no batteries needed. However mechanism was balky which is why I sent it back.
1,too loud and too sensitive, wouldn't recommend fishing with this in windy weather. too loud could scare fish away.
1,The anchor I got might have been a lemon - I returned it.  The problem was when the grappels were deployed/down, you are supposed to be able to turn the coupler to lock them in the open position.  The one I got did not lock.  So if you used it and threw it overboard, when it hit the bottom it would fold up and not grab the bottom.  Again, I'm not sure if it was just a lemon or what.  Amazon was the awesome as always on the return and I found another cheaper elsewhere so didn't reorder.		As a side note the anchor I received was not the one pictured, not sure if it was due to the picture being of a heavier anchor or what.  The one I got did not have the bulge at the top, just a straight stick.
1,This is horrible piece of crap, complete waste of money, won't even bother sending back for a few dollars minus shipping cost.	A compass should at least point north but this compass somehow manages to fail that task.	Made very cheap perfect China quality but that is alright for the price, as long as it can point north which this compass doesn't.
1,The ice packs provided with this freeze solid so you cannot conform them to your shoulder or arm and it makes the item uncomfortable and useless. I have another similar item for my knee and the gel pack is made by 3M and never freezes solid. It gets freezing cold but still molds to what ever curve on your body you place it on. I returned this shoulder thing.
1,Very low rise, but the color is awesome. My chaps are bleeding through from sweat onto pants so slightly discolored in that area. Not a fan of the ankles you pull down around the foot, kind of uncomfortable when riding, I can feel it through boot. Looks amazing on when riding, but not functional when schooling.
1,I've been using this bike computer for a few weeks now and so far after about 50 miles, it's held up. It's got a bunch of displays such as speed, max speed, avg speed, cadence, trip time, stopwatch, temperature, odometer, etc. The ones I use most are speed and trip time. It uses a cr2032 3V coin battery and one was included so that was a plus. The battery is a pain to put in and replace though. There's this o-ring to help it be waterproof but it pops out every time I open the battery cover. Installation on the bike is simple enough and the sensor on the spoke hasn't fallen off yet or required me to make adjustments. It allows you to store info for 2 different bikes but you need to buy a separate mounting bracket.		Overall, for the price it's pretty decent and I like it so far. I haven't abused it, dropped it or otherwise put it in extreme use yet so only time will tell how it holds up.		**Edit: After about a years use it no longer registers movement from the wheel sensor. It seems there's a contact problem with the small connectors in the back to the harness. It works if I press down on it but once I stop applying pressure, it no longer picks up a signal. I could probably drop some solder on each contact to get better spacing but this would be a pain. I've dropped it down to 2 stars because of this.
1,i tried to replace my 120$ lawson blue ridge hammock with this and it was a very frustrating experience.  at first i was impressed by the simplicity and compactness of the hammock, but once i got it set up i quickly saw why it was so cheap.	the lawson lets you spread your legs, which you will notice isn't very possible in this hammock, which is bunched together at the end. in this hammock you can spread your feet but then they are against the bugnetting.	it's also very hard to get a breeze, which is easy in my Lawson that i miss so much.	you feel like you're going to rip it in half every time you get in because of how the zipper is designed.	extremely weak flimsy straps hold the bugnet up, suspended by another line because they didn't have the engineering foresight that Lawson clearly does with it's smart bugnet suspension system.	from now on i will be using an anti-gravity recliner or cheap hammock and with a cheap bugnet around it. look at how people are 'relaxing' in these 50$ bugnet hammocks and you will see that it's not comfortable at all unless you like playing larva in a cocoon.
1,Great idea.  The pads are thick enough and properly positioned.  Unfortunately, the legs are too loose and the pants migrate upward by the time I have ridden three or four miles.  By the time I have ridden five miles I have a thick twisted knot of material and padding in my groin area.  I have tried several different styles of over shorts and even the shearest of shorts migrate up with the padded pants. Finally, I gave up and threw the padded pants in the garbage.  There is a reason conventional cycling shorts have thick elastic at the legsit holds them in place.
1,It fit when it came in the mail.  1 wash later and it seems 3" shorter.  The cloth is paper thin and takes little effort to see through it when you are not wearing it.  I'm not sure how transparent it is when you are wearing it as I have not yet worn it outside of the house due to the shrinkage.
1,cheaply made
1,This holster I would not recommend to anyone, I understand appendix carry as a minimalist design, but reholstering wasn't any better than any other kydex holsters that I've used, I have a glock 43, and even putting it behind my back made it nearly impossible to reholster. Positives were good retention and quality kydex.
1,This unit for a glock19Gen 4 has two shims you have to put on gun. Do not like using shims on any gun. Video on Crimson site does NOT show using shims on this gun. Requested return and credit on this item. I have been issued prepaid return label and sent out today via ups.
1,I never saw any reviews on the texture besides how amazingly soft they are... and they truly are. However... they are like very thick panty hose. I wore ankle weights and they pulled a lot of small threads. THEN... my husband tells me not to wear patterned panties with these because they're somewhat see through. Even more so in the lights in the gym. Don't purchase them for anything other than yoga in a dim room or for fashion. Oh... and don't bend over unless you want everyone to see your goodies. Haha! Otherwise I do love the product but it's definitely not what I wanted. Simply wanted tougher quality for the gym and not so obviously see-through. The fit is perfect for size. I'm about a 12/14 and bought an extra large to be safe. While they fit great, the band was a little more snug. Just kid of contradictory to the leggings is all.
1,the top strap that secures the blade had no snap in button ?	disappointed!!!
1,The stitching in the back chafes on my sit bone area. Seems like it's lower on mine than in the pics.
1,No way these are 22.  Okay for lawn mowing, but other plugs are way better.
1,too big
1,I read one review that said the brass rods were cheap and flimsy and how they broke with just a little pressure put on them. Well I still went ahead and ordered this kit anyway, sure wish I would have listened to him,on my first use cleaning my 223 the rod bent/broke with very little pressure applied to the rod. The kit might look pretty with a lot of stuff in it but if the rods are so cheap and break so easy the kit becomes worthless,wish I could get my money back on this cheap worthless piece of Chinese junk
1,it doesnt show on the pictures that it's white on the inside (have to wash it every other ride or so as it just gets nasty quick). After few washes, seams in couple of the sports started coming apart.
1,If you have your rings tightened to your scope and adjusted to fit on a picatinny rail system, it will NOT be interchangeable. I tried to place my scope on this rail system after adjusting the rings to fit on a Badger Ordnance (much more expensive and worth it IMO) and EGW picatinny (twice the price as this) rail system. The slots are a millimeter or two off and will require moving the rings to get it to fit properly. If you only use Weaver bases like this, you should be good, but if you have two different brands of picatinny rail systems, then this won't work. Unless I got a bad base or something, I don't recommend this one. The screws are still are little long in for the front-most hole anyway.
1,This thing jammed half way through day one of an 8 day trek. Luckily I had a spare. But that one two was horrible...very difficult to get water through. When screwed onto my water bag, the connection leaked on both filters so that contaminated water dripped down into the water bottle. This was a horrible experience and could bring your hike to an abrupt halt. I tossed both new filters as soon as I got to a trash can, and ordered a Sawyer.
1,Unfortunately you have to do this after each swim.
1,IT DIED
1,Good size for a bike (not huge, but big enough). Poor quality though (cheap polyester, does not hold it's shape).
1,I've used these on a regular 70# bag, one of those	"Bob" type freestanding bags, and a focus pad dummy	of my own design for the past 6 months. My workouts	have been only twice a week at most, and for less	than 1/2 hour per workout. The gloves  fit well into	my larger-than-average hands. The padding material	on the left glove is starting to separate or is being	flattened at the knuckles. So I will soon need a new	pair. I miss my old Everlast #4305 gloves which I	used for years on both speed and heavy bags.	I cannot recommend this product.
1,Pretty disappointed, it would not work with my S&W 686 7 shot revolver.  Would not fit past the frame correctly.  This is a common revolver.
1,Difficult to assemble and break it period was exhausting!
1,I do not like this stroller at all. In the first time out the brake line kept falling loose and dragging on the ground, the seat restraint broke, and it constantly pulls to the left making it incredibly difficult to run with. A poor product for the money paid, poor quality.
1,Not enough padding. If you like a a softer feel without bulk try the Snipers, much better.
1,Said dishwasher safe, I believe, put it in top rack one time, melted a hole in the cap. Lame.
1,Started to shred first time use. I had high hopes due to all the rave reviews. As soon as I got it, I decided to test it by doing mountain climbers. The foam started to shred on first use! Cheap, returning. Stick to TPE exercise mats. Also my mat did not come in with a bag or have a logo as pictured. The label however did say Rixxer.
1,It's very disappointing to get something different then in the pic cwx is very hard for women to find anything other than size L I have sent it back it looked like it was for five year old.it would be nice if it wasn't in black I have pets and it black attract every thing so I try not buy stuff in dark color to much.im trying 2 different cw - in lucky me XL hope all works out well.i do like what I read on what it can do to benefit the body.
1,shot these straight into the old wood chipper , not even good for beginners , didn't want to pay more postage to return so save yourself my headache and pass, a real arrow needs to be fit to your bow people.
1,Beware! tahoetrading ships a different Sweat Gutr designed to attach to a hard hat, not the headband you are looking for.
1,Compass and paracord are good, but flint doesn't work.
1,The bag smells like it was washed with vomit however it has feces on it so I don't think it was washed at all. It has cuts in it which were resewn. Threads coming out everywhere. I washed it 3 times and drowned it in a strong disinfectant. It STILL smells heavily of throwup and now cleaning agents.
1,I placed an order for our granddaughter for one of her Christmas presents Sunlite Windmill Streamers - Pink/Purple on December 3rd that was supposed to come from Green Canyon Outfitters.  I have contacted them several times and they say its been delivered and they are washing their hands of it and will not take responsibility for us not receiving what we paid for.  I have never dealt with such an unprofessional company that you pay for something and when the people that ordered from them don't receive what they paid for all they say is were sorry you couldn't find it.  When they shipped the product they didn't give us a shipping tracking number only once we complained then and only then were we sent a tracking number that only said it was delivered to this zip code.  .  My family and I have been ordering from Amazon for a long time and have bought many things and never have bought anything that Amazon didn't stand behind.  I have a little girl that is supposed to be getting tricycle with a basket and streamers all of which we've ordered and received except the streamers from the Green Mountain Outfitters.  I will never ever order anything from them ever again if I find out what I want to order comes from them I will cancel my order from here on out.
1,Way to tight for me. I was told I had mooseknuckle.
1,As others have said, these housings are spiral wound, which allows them to give some. After much adjustment, my shifting on the rear derailer is worse now than it was before replacing the housing and cable. If I get it set up so it shifts perfectly going down the cassette, it doesn't shift up it correctly. I have to push on the lever just a bit extra to get it up into the next cog, only on the lower part of the cassette. Its hard to explain, but you can feel the give in the cable housing when shifting to the larger cogs. I'm pulling these off and buying Jagwire, which is what I should have done to begin with. It just sucks because I have to also rip off my bar tape and replace it as well.		Update: I installed the Jagwire cables and with very little adjustment, the shifting is as smooth as it should be.
1,Piece of junk, the rail was mounted off to one side of the dust cover. I made it work but shouldn't have had to.easy to install. My Holo sight is canted a little to the right now. Funky.
1,Shorter than expected but im sure I can still use it if thought out thoroughly
1,awkward design.nothing like its predecessor. hard to open,hard to close.blade length,3.8 inches from handle. no way can you stretch it to the advertised 4 ".at he bottom of my knife bag w my esee 4
1,IT works but not as stiff as I want.  When you attach stuff to the belt is sags
1,i ordered a different one in white.  this was a different pattern than the white and it had an XL tag but was smaller than the other xl
1,The sword is cheaper than it looks.
1,Noise, sweating, way too loose.
1,I get a lot of blurry pictures, missed pictures because I see tracks in the snow in front of the camera but nothing on the card, or when it does take pictures half the time they are pink...would not buy again...getting ready to toss in trash...
1,You get what you pay for.
1,I am really surprised by these great reviews because I think it sucks... I finally got it sighted in after 300 rounds and went shooting yesterday .... Way off.... It looks nice that's why I gave it one star... I'm going to have to spend more money for a nicer one that will stay sighted in like a bushnell.... Trust me spend a little more get a little more.
1,I used this thing 3 times in 14months.  It was stored inside and well taken care of. it looks brand new.  the inner fan went out so it does not move the air as it should. it is not replaceable according to coleman.  to the land fill you go.....  114$ for 43-4 uses.		loved it when it worked.  :(
1,The upper band on the knee sleeve is about 35% to tight and cuts off circulation even though im a thin build person, and compression from the actual spandex is minimal. I like the concept of the silicone on the upper band, it really helps the brace to stay one. the product seems to be of good quality, but the tightness of the upper band is just to excessive. The product would be wonderful if that were not the case.
1,Really flimsy. I'm 170 lbs and the thing feel like it's going to fall over.  parts arrived bent, pad slips on the arm portion. arm bar in the middle is not appropriately sized and the lower legs remain slightly rotated. Not worth the money.
1,Way small on their sizing. Order three times what you thing you need.
1,Had to return mine.  Felt like I was looking through a straw.  And the optics off center had that wine glass / barrel distortion that was distracting, to me.  Finally , I spent much longer than normal with the diopter trying to get the reticle sharp.  Not sure I ever really did, which in itself says alot.  I'm sure it works fine.  And to be fair, I normally spend a bit more on my optics than this.  After seeing this one, I will go back to spending a bit more.
1,Very poor quality not worth more than 5 ddollars
1,Did not fit my son...sizing information should be more specific...
1,Being the same design as my other water bottles, i thought this one would be the same great quality.  It even has the exact same lid but sadly leaks because the bottle is not smooth on the seal area......  If you want a great bottle look at these instead	http://www.amazon.com/Free-24oz-Drink-Bottles-Made/dp/B00589FDGY/ref=pd_sim_sg_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0SP0JMQVQAG0FHXQR3ED
1,The cover is suppose to cover from a 17 to 19 foot boat 102 inch wide, I have a  18.2 foot bass boat and it wouldn't cover it. I ordered by the spec's and it still didn't work.
1,I initially loved these because I didn't have to fight to get shin guards on my two year old. But after a few months (barely any use), the styrofoam shin guard inserts started falling apart.
1,Too tight and the Sr model is too loose. We tried the Schutt Air 6 batting helmet and it fits great
1,DO NOT mount this scope on a magnum spring piston rifle. I have confirmation from UTG that this scope was "tested" on the RWS Model 54. I don't believe it. Maybe I received a bad one, whatever the problem, with less than fifty rounds through it, it is toast.
1,Unfortunately, I had to return these because they didn't wash well at all. They were really cute but not good quality.
1,I bought this stun gun expecting SOME assurance if I were cornered in a tough situation. In the first place, after reading other reviews, I still do not know when the weapon is fully charged, nor do they. Does the charge light go off, turn green, stay red and you just have to guess when it is charged? What? It does not say in the instruction book, and when I have tested it after a 7-hour charge, it does not work. Oh, the flashlight works fine, but I didn't pay for a flashlight, which would have been a lot cheaper. Someone needs to contact the Chinese manufacterer and get this cleared up for us customers PRONTO!	And besides that, I paid the full $89.95 for this piece of junk, not the current sale price.	RIPOFF big time!
1,HARD AS A BOARD WITH SHARP CORNERS. Feels like a short 2x4 board. Harder and more uncomfortable than the cheap one it replaced. I'm sorry but it's memory foam, it forgot. I remember is my sore backside.
1,Junk. Broke after three test fires.
1,What a waste, to small to wear over your shoulders, just falls off because its not long enough. Cant be used as a scarf or bandana, its just to short, cant even wrap it around your forhead. As for cooling efect, well, its a wet rag. Didnt even see fit to give it a decent burial in a trash can, just through it out my car window into the street. Maybe some homeless bum will use it to wipe his yahoo.	Maybe he'll give it more stars
1,Garbage.  Came out of the package with the shock cords broken in both poles.  Burrs on the pole end ferrles sliced through the pole sleeves.  Seems leaked.  Had to repair the zipper 3 times.  After my 5 day stay, decided it wasn't worth any further effort.  Even saved myself the effort of packing it up.  Was left in the garbage....
1,I was really excited to receive this vise. The box was in perfect condition, no damage. Once I opened it I quickly discovered the butt vise was broken. I can see why, it is very cheaply made. Two very small contact points holds the vise in place. I will JB weld it but I can't recommend this item to any one.
1,Very flimsy, easy to break. Of 4, one arrived cracked on the lid, one cracked down the barrel with careful use, and another had its lid crack through error of my own (a low toss to a friend in need). It's nice that they're clear, to see which are full or empty, and you really need to have some pods for continuing play for significant amounts of time, but the plastic is too thin/weak, and breaks with even careful usage, nonetheless from any increased stress. Also, the lids popping off is not as simple as it could be, since you'll be needing to do so 1 handed, and quickly.		Probably best to select either a different brand, or a different model from Tippmann. I haven't tried others yet, so I don't have recommendations for alternatives.
1,I bought these for a split limb crossbow, the first time I shot it they flew off. There wasn't any instructions on how to install them.
1,broke quickly
1,Spent a lot of time trying to set this watch up but to no avail.  My husband who excels at these kinds of things tried as well...still wouldn't work.  We wanted to at least hear the alarm and see if we could hear it but it never went off.		I only wanted it for the alarm as I have to eat a little something every three hours - I'm staying with my Polder timer/stop watch/alarm that I bought at amazon.com - actually bought two of them.		If you like complicated, you'll love this watch.  I returned it.
1,Light wieght easily puntured ok for some uses I suppose, but won't last long! I won't buy another one. Sorry
1,I'm very disappointed, maybe it's me but the date is 12 hours off unless I set the watch on military time. If the time is set on eastern standard the date is off. I'm going to purchase another watch! It is light weight and easy to read with the light!
1,Cheap plastic glasses, I question the polarization. It just gives a darker tint
1,After having read through several reviews, I was very excited to see that other reviewers said that these coats run small. I'm petite at 4' 8", so it is difficult to find clothing that fits well. I ordered an XS, hoping that it wouldn't be too small. Unfortunately, upon receiving the coat and trying it on, it was much too big. My husband even said that I looked like a little kid playing dress up with her mom's coat! Just for kicks, he tried it on, and while it was snug, it nearly fit him! For reference, he is 5' 10" and normally wears a men's large.		In addition to two zippered pockets on either side, there is a zippered interior breast pocket and zippered exterior breast pocket. It seems to have plenty of storage space. The hood is detachable as well.		As far as quality goes, it seemed to be well-made, and I think it would be nice and warm in the winter. I won't get to test that, but hopefully others who find a better fit will enjoy it.
1,More expensive than the belly band made by PS Products but much lower quality. The elastic is flimsy and doesn't seem like enough support for a heavier firearm; not a problem with my other belly band holster. The stitching around the "money pocket" failed the first time I tried to use it.
1,I returned this product because the screw would not go into the club. Not sure if this is a problem will all clubs.
1,Not so great in the water...supposedly that's how they were introduced online. The buckles rusted only after 2 times in the pool. The sand also gets hard as rock after they dry. Yuck!
1,Had to return the sight, under warranty, after 11 months due to reduced illumination. To complicate the problem it took almost 6 weeks to obtain a replacement, after two follow up inquiries! Questions regarding reliability and customer warranty support.
1,Packaging looks great but for the price the items seemed flimsy and did not fit together well.
1,I purchased this rear bike light, and it is of very cheap construction. The batteries did not want to sit flush in the wells; I needed to slightly bend down the metal contacts to keep them in there. Then I turned the thing on, and only 4 of 5 LEDs were illuminated.		I decided to use it anyway, and it worked alright for about the first 30min of biking. Item began to shut off spontaneously during night bike ride. NOW this thing does not work at all, even with brand new batteries! Please, just spend some more money for a far better product and something that will actually let motorists know you're on the road.
1,Very bad stop shooting the third week all that happens is the bbs dribble out of the barrel. I took it to a airsoft repair shop and told them to look at it which they did. This is a piece of junk!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS
1,I planned on using this product with my collapsible fishing pole but the reel foot is that of a regular sized reel.
1,Being targeted at bike messengers, I expected a robust, durable performance tire.  It did not have any of those attributes.  It really surprised me, because Panaracer are usually pretty good.  They would flat easily, rolling resistance is more than average, and the wore pretty quickly.		I don't quite know what the folks at Panaracer were thinking... maybe it isn't about robustness and durability... maybe it's targeting occasional sports riders to lay down their cash for what they think should be a good tire. Or maybe it's just about offering something for skids that will wear fast and be replaced often.  Either way, it met none of my expectations.  I was very disappointed.
1,It's an imitation of teeter hang-ups, but it does not give full 100%  inversion, basically making your back to rest on the support-bench. Only full-inversion actually gives the required stretch. Returned it.
1,Cheap, didn't seal.
1,WAY TOO SALTY		The flavor is surprisingly good considering this is freeze-dried food, but the salt content is off the chart. Why? Especially if this is used as camping or emergency food, the salt content will make people hit their water supply harder than they would otherwise, which could be a problem when camping or surviving an emergency, where extra water might be hard to come by.
1,It may be my chest/body but I had a hard time getting this Polar to register my heart rate.  If I didn't move and was stationary then it would (sometimes) get my heart rate.  But once I started working out I would lose my hr.  I moistened the sensor etc.  I returned mine and got a Timex HRM.  This model was recommended by my workout coach so your mileage may vary.  In fact he has an earlier version and it works fine.
1,The bag is not waterproof. Water got inside and i ruined my batteries that were inside
1,Water leaks
1,I bought the Pure Fun trampoline after the one I had for many years broke one too many springs. I've had this one for a number of months now. It came warped out of the box. I use a piece of cardboard to stabilize it but it still moves across the floor as I use it. The first spring snapped after about a month and another one breaks after about every 5 uses. I like the 40 inch size but will need to buy a new one soon as this one was not built to last. I will not purchase this model again.
1,The reason I only gave this two stars is because it does not have a groove in the inside surface that rides against the front (bullet edge) of the magazine. The picture shown here is not the item I received in that the picture shows the groove. That groove is critical if your mags have the mag catch on the front of the mag because without it, the loader hangs up on the mag catch every time I load a bullet and I have to wiggle it several times to get it to release. It's very frustrating and I will be buying a loader from a competitor that has that groove. It's actually faster and easier to load the mags by hand than to use this item. I bought two loaders for different handguns, one from ADCO and one from the competitor and the competitor's product had more attention to detail during design and production. Just look very closely at the pictures here and you will see what I'm talking about. That groove is very important and the item received did not have it. I expected more attention to detail from ADCO. A redesign is in order to include that detail.
1,Small not bright lights.  They were not even very bright in complete darkness.  Sent back for Trijicons
1,Very cheaply made! I thought it was paper at first, very thin plastic. I would say it's worth about a $1.00 at best.
1,The first aid kit is miniature tiny small barley has anything in it. I went and bought some other items to fill it. Its way!!!! over priced. Its looks like something that would come in a Barbie doll set.
1,Busted quick. Little use. No abuse. Snapped off plate due to poor plastic construction. Get a different tee style.
1,I returned.  It is not accurate.
1,I bought this as an undershirt for cycling when the temp drops and found it to be cold and clammy.  Not at all what I wanted and I probably wasted my money on it.
1,I purchased this because I have the Maxpedition version that I LOVE. It is my EDC, and yes, it is an option for off-body concealed carry (I prefer on-body). As others mentioned, this one really isn't.  I wanted another as a go-bag for my QRP HF radio. All things fit perfectly as expected and after I spent a few hours setting up the radio, batteries, etc., the zippers start to fail. I've had other $35 bags in the past and fared well. I knew I could not expect Maxpedition quality but two days of light use is all the zippers lasted. The sling is a bit flimsy (OK, now I'm comparing with Maxpedition) and I don't think it will hold to any kind of repeated use.
1,Not durable
1,I wouldn't buy it again, it leaks if the canteen tilts a little at all from upright.  E.g. if you have it in a gym bag or backpack or etc.
1,I was extremely disappointed in this product. I purchased the silver band and was excited about having a ring again. I took a really nice photo of the ring and even posted it on my Instagram account to share with friends. Then, after about 10 hours the silver began to flake off exposing the raw rubber band. One can even see the silver flakes coming off the ring and transferring to the skin. I thought this was a quality product that had been molded out of silver-metallic like plastic.		If I had known it was just painted silver, I would have assumed that the paint would come off eventually and would have avoided purchasing this from the start. I returned the product for a full refund. After submitting my return request I went back and read the one star reviews by other customers. I found that I'm not the only one this has happened to.		Also, the seller claimed it would make my wife fall madly in love with me again. It did not. The seller has either not tested the product and ignored the bad reviews by other customers OR knows of the faulty product and intentionally tries to sell his/her customers a poor quality product.		I chose not to share my photo of the ring on my finger after first putting it on because I didn't want to mislead anyone into thinking it would actually look that good all the time.
1,Does not provide enough clearance for a 40mm scope without a riser on a flat top AR.
1,This travel cover is too flexible in the middle and is too hard to maneuver on a bus or train or just getting it into the airport
1,Feels pretty cheap, cause it is cheap.
1,I was doing some last-minute Christmas shopping, and someone on my list wanted a six-can cooler. I saw this at what seemed a very reasonable price and made my purchase. It arrived today...I have never been so disappointed!		Igloo may make a great product, but the copywriters in marketing must have never seen the cooler they were describing:		"The Igloo Mini Playmate Cooler is perfect for keeping a few drinks, lunch, or a fresh-caught trout..." Even though the label clearly states "6 cans," it will not hold more than four. And that trout will have to be chopped into pieces to fit. The inside of the cooler measures 7 3/8 x 5 1/2 x 5 7/8 (length x width x depth).		Essentially this is an insulated lunch box. (And I already have two of those from when my kids would detassel corn in the summer.) This is not a poor quality product; the problem is that it will not hold six cans as advertised. One reviewer said it will hold six cans if you lay the cans on their side. Nope! It still holds only four. Believe the other one-star reviews, and don't make the mistake I did.
1,My joke of a knife chipped like crazy on chopping hard wood before breaking on a knot. Chris Tanner (the designer said it best: Schrade/BTI: Fix your stuff! Test results show the heat treat is garbage (if it actually is actually 1070) and "they've gotta get a handle on their manufacturing." This makes me doubt the quality of all "Schrade Quality" knives and I'm done with giving them my money. Pissing off Chris Tanner with his huge youtube reach is about as dumb as it gets, Schrade must be plenty dumb!
1,This thing won't get hot enough to bake "canned biscuits"....waste of money,waste of time...I hope someone reads this before they order. Its a POS....I would not give it a one star
1,destroys the wire that you are trying to pull.  I have better luck just pulling the wire tight with gloves on my hands
1,We've had this for a few years now.  Trying to fit 5 bikes on it is an act of hilarity. You need adapters, maybe put smaller bikes upside down ... and with 4 -5 bikes the bouncing really goes into high gear.  Yakima support pointed me to a tech bulletin on this rack ... they are replacing the shim and plastic bushing on these to stabilize them ... give them a call.  Ours will be here in a few days.  Hopefully that will do the trick and we'll actually be able to use this for more than local transport.		Update 09/7/12	The new shim and bushing appear to be working great. Hopefully the plastic and rubber lasts in the California heat!		Update 10/3/2012	The bushing didn't last. I've gotten another one from Yak and will try to jimmy rig some thing.  Too bad really because it really did the trick while it lasted.		Update 11/10/2012	The shim and bushing workaround from Yak. just will not last.  It looks like we'll need 5-6 of them a year at this rate!  Time to look into a different rack.		Update 11/15/2012	I let Yak know the shim workaround wasn't lasting and after more inquiry on their part they are replacing the rack with a new one. I'll update this review once we give the new one a try.  Hopefully we just had a dud.
1,I did not pay attn to the specs, it only allows 16g CO2 vs being able to use them all
1,As others have said, this is a shaky project. It stopped working halfway through a central american trip, leaving me without sterile water. I followed instructions precisely, but I kept getting a sad face. I'm returning this and getting a simpler version.
1,It works well, durable, well made, the key mechanism takes some time getting used too, thieves don't like handcuffs so I think the look if these is intimidating.  But you need a receipt from your LBS or a letter stating your bikes value to get the warranty from Master. So if your bike is older or you don't live near where you bought your bike you cant warranty it easily.		After having this for over a year I am adding some more.  The great thing about this lock is you cant get leverage to pry it open or damage the lock.  The worst thing about these locks is Master Lock does not have replacement keys, they cannot make them, they only give you two.  YOu need to contact a lock smith or hardware store to get copies and this is hard to fine,  Not everyone can do this.  I originally had this at 5 stars but Master needs to step it up and either provide extra keys or at least provide a replacement.  Krypyonite and On Guard at least offer replacement key service for a charge.		After having a longer period of time, I am now noticing the key lock cylinder not as smooth.  You need to push the key in, jiggle it, and either squeeze the lock as if you are closing it and turn the key, or open the cuff while turning the key.  For this much money the lock/key mechanism should be better		November 2013, This lock is still going, hard to steal your bike, but the key mechanism is getting worse.  Masterlock needs to do something about this.  I would not buy another once based on the crappy keys
1,Too hard to put on with the way the waist belt is. Didn't feel comfortable on my back. Waist pockets are worthless. I have small hands and the pockets are so tight you have a hard time reaching in them. I wanted to like this pack :(
1,It's a great idea, but it doesn't work with snub nose revolvers		If you have a Taurus .38 Spec +P or a .357 Mag snub nose, the cylinders do NOT open out enough to be able to use.	I bought 3 and gave them away, and nobody else could us the 5 round loader.		If your cylinder is tight or chamber is close to the frame, it will not work.
1,Too flimsy if you're wearing a lot of gear.
1,Bought this for a gift for my son intending for him to keep it in his car. I received it 12/8/15 and the sticker on the front of the bag says Best By 10-01-2016. By reckoning, that is less than a year of optimal shelf life. I'm quite disappointed, but not enough to request a refund. Sold by: Ship It Now
1,The rear strap kept loosening and the fin would come off.
1,Purchased these and they did not feel supportive at all.  It is very dumb that they only come in one.  The price to quality ratio is completely off.  I should've just purchased other ones.		Disclaimer: I was provided this product or a discount on this product in exchange for my honest feedback on the product and my thoughts on it. I want to say that all of my reviews are comprised of my unbiased, honest opinions. Although I received them at a discount or free on some occasions, I do my best to not let this effect my reviews in any way and I will call out a cheap product when I see one
1,I experienced the same problem as others; the plastic piece forming the pivot broke. I ended up making a new piece out of aluminum. The design is great in the way that it folds and sets up, but they really need to revise the construction and make that piece out of aluminum. The saw cuts very well and the blade is a common size so it is easily replaceable.
1,Fits well, but seams are too thick around areas where the hand/fingers bend in the creases.  This causes a lot of irritation around those areas and can't keep the gloves on for extended workouts.		Been using these https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KCTC6FQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 and they are great.
1,Suit really runs small!!!
1,Very disappointed. No matter how I adjusted this I could not even grip my VTAC M&P 9mm to draw it. Never mind trying to reach the release. I had such high hopes for this product.
1,Didn't last.  Wore out too quickly
1,I was looking for something discrete that would serve double duty as a pen and self defense tool. This thing is big, heavy, unwieldy to write with and most importently looks more like a weapon than a pen. It felt solid in the hand, unfortunately the cap is held to the pen body with a cheap plastic insert that was cracked when I got it. There is a lot of side to side play in the cap and pen. Very poor design/materials. I returned it immediately and bought 2 parker jotters instead.
1,I was expecting a solid thick well made belt...instead it was a thin nylon strap with elastic loops.	I guess it's what it is
1,This net was recommended for a cargo bicycle trailer, but the hooks are too small for the frame of these trailers. I will have to add some tie-wraps to the frame to support the hooks of this net. Not what I expected.
1,Removed this from the packaging and found a small square of black material was blocking the reticle from being projected.  It was inside the little projection chamber of the unit, up against the window.  I had to unscrew the cover (could only get to 3 out of the 4 screws), pry it up carefully, and use a sharp, thin tool to push the little square of material aside.  Who knows when it might show up again after normal use, I couldn't see where it ended up.		With that out of the way, the unit is working fine so far after a few hundred rounds mounted to my Beretta ARX160 22LR.  If it wasn't so inexpensive I would have made a much bigger fuss.  If you do buy this, good luck to you.
1,It was defective and Amazon refused to replace it, even after admitting fault.
1,I bought these specifically for the fact that they were the only ones I could find that were made in the USA. BUT they are not made in the USA, they are made in China. The packaging is also different then shown so I wonder what the "sold exclusively by" claim is for?		The item is fine but NOT what is being advertised and that is why I am giving 2 stars.
1,not sure if we got a bad batch or if they were old but these balls did not have the same bounce as the ones we are used to. Ended up having to put pants on and go to the store to buy ping pong balls that actually bounced well.		Im sure they would be great if you are just using them for beer pong though.
1,Crappy. Does not stay in place matter how tight I strap it. I strap it, and before you know it, it slides down my leg.
1,It rides up into my eyes, and breathing while wearing fogs ones goggles -not enough air flow.  A nice idea poorly executed.
1,These things are miniature in size. All u can do is maybe heat up soup
1,This thing is decent...the topper doesn't really lock when you pull it out, so it closes pretty easily when you're drinking out of it, which is obnoxious. You have to squeeze it to get much water out and it's a little stiffer than it ought to be to facilitate that. Could be worse, but for the price, I think it should be better. If it was $10, I'd give it four stars.
1,I have to return it because the width is too small for me
1,Substandard product...lens had a defect that made it out of focus.  Do not recommend purchasing
1,Single bell, really loud, not the easiest to use, I wouldn't buy another one
1,Product arrives w/o assembly instructions; I may have permanently damaged one of the pair in the process.
1,Very weak stitching. Mine started unraveling at the seams immediately.  Despite the stretchy material, the 7'0 model is a very tight fit for boards bigger than 21.5" wide.
1,These are very sharp. However just handling them with my hands one of the razors broke off. I do not recommend this for hunting.
1,After being outside for two months I went for the first time to remove the video cards and upon opening them every single one of them had water coming out!!!!!		Horrible just horrible. When you have all four of the same product leak, that means the design is bad!! However? They all still worked after drying off which is good I guess..
1,After using HeatMax toe warmers for years, I bought these toe warmers for the first time because the package size was bigger. These are nowhere as good as Heatmax toe warmers. The price of the toe warmers fluctuates a lot from time to time, and as of now, these are almost one and half times the cost of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Little-Hotties-Adhesive-Toe-Warmers-30-Pairs/dp/B001GKLWNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Little Hotties Adhesive Toe Warmers 30 Pairs</a>.		These toes warmers are neither as warm as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/HeatMax-Toe-Warmers-Value-Pack-Adhesive-6-Pair/dp/B000VI12KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HeatMax Toe Warmers Value Pack (Adhesive) - 6 Pair</a>&nbsp;and nor does their effect last as long, although they are cheaper than HeatMax toe warmers, as of now. I do not know why HeatMax stopped selling the bigger package. I regret buying these and will probably not buy them again.
1,For the price thought I was getting a better product, definitely not a security deterrent
1,At the beginning of 2018 I decided I wanted to buy a couple scooters and begin to do some research. I purchased one super scooters super lithium 1500(directly from super scooters), and one of these EcoSmart Metro scooters. Clearly a different price range however we loved the basket of the EcoSmart and thought the ride Etc would be acceptable. Perhaps the key is to never ride a nicer scooter first! Essentially after the first ride we realized there was no way that this EcoSmart could be our second scooter because it is so unbelievably slow and underpowered that the other person riding would have to be waiting all the time. Secondly it is no different than a standard bicycle in that it has no suspension or shocks whatsoever so you feel every single bump and crack in the sidewalk or road and it jars your back Etc. I realize that this is truly a case of you get what you paid for.. because while this EcoSmart may be a great bargain, it is certainly very frustrating to ride being so slow and riding so roughly. I'm a hundred 50 lb and live in Florida which is flat, and its just so slow it's ridiculous. The first time I rode it, I thought something was wrong with the throttle because it wouldn't go any faster but then realize that was actually it... It's so slow that it's actually prohibited in terms of being quick to run up to the store at cetera.  This might be good for a kid who does not care about the rough ride or speed or someone who is really on a tight budget but otherwise I would highly highly highly recommend that you look toward a scooter that has suspension and more power. The super lithium 1500 is a dream compared.. and if someone doesn't need that much power or speed, the other non lithium models offer the same cushy ride and a lower price point.
1,Oozed, leaked, and dripped all over us. Terrible quality.
1,I am very disappointed.  I ordered this mat in green and I got a blue/red, not very attractive. I really needed for  a bday present and now I  won't be able to give it as a gift for the actual day.
1,Fell apart in use, which hurt
1,The levels aren't actually level, and they don't match each other when placed on the same surface.  Each time I've tried to use these I've ended up spending a bunch of time messing with them before finally going back to just using a proper level and a plumb line.
1,I thought the body was carbon fiber but instead is a textured plastic that looks like it in the pictures.  The blade is not easy to flip out.  The finger hole makes holding the knife very comfortable but that is about all that is good about this knife.
1,The white band is defective and I could not attach.
1,After reading the paper instructions, I called the company to find out how can the watch be turned off when not in use. The company's response is "there is no way to turn off the watch except to remove the battery. The watch should run for about 24 months before the battery needs replacement." Since I do not use the watch on a daily basis, I would have liked a watch that does have the ability to be turned off.
1,I have to assume it works because I've seen it being used (hence the 2 stars and not 1).  However, in order to use it, I would have to redrill my ball which is not cost effective. I have a piece of tape in the hole and also wear tape on my calloused thumb.  Even with all the tapes out/off, I can't get my thumb into the ball with the thumbsaver on.  Maybe I'll get one of my old balls and scrape out some of the insert so my thumb can fit with it on . . .
1,I ordered this item and the first came with no canopy and i had to return it. Amazon overnighted me a replacement and the second chair came with no canopy. The canopy is the major reason I wanted the chair because I am fair skinned and burn easily.		The chair is very small and not meant for tall or anyone larger than a child. I am disappointed in this chair but love Amazon for being so great about the replacement and customer service. A+ customer service but not a great product.
1,This would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the price.  But I couldn't buy a competitor's option - because there aren't any.  And you can't really use the tent for anything other than backyard camping without it.  I really feel this is a way for Coleman to ding you for a bit more.  It should really just come with the tent - it's a simple piece of fabric for heavens sake and (as of today) they want $80 for it?  Really Coleman?  For $80 I can buy a competitors tent that comes WITH a rainfly.  I checked with a local seamstress and she said she could hand-make one for that much, but larger.		As you can tell, I'm not happy about this.  It's too darn bad that the tent it fits is such as awesome product.		This should be a $19.95 product at MOST if sold separately for replacement - but for the price of the tent, it should come included.  And you'd still make a 5x profit on it.		Come on Coleman - a tiny rainfly (it barely covers the top) should not cost that much - don't let marketing department greed get in the way of an excellent product.
1,what a long wait for something that fits in a front pocket ??? they say 3 to 5 days but its not home
1,The item description is simply incorrect. No carrying case with handle, and item seems cheap - DO NOT BUY	Photo 1 is what I ordered and was expecting - Photo 2 is what I got
1,sadly 1 of the 4 of this chair i bought broke completely after 3 days use. do to the policy of 30 days from time of purchase for returns & the fact that we bought these 3 weeks before our vacation & didn't sit in them until then we are stuck w useless pc of junk & no options. the other 3 were were great but a technicality forces me to give this the lowest rating.
1,This belt is very difficult to adjust. The Velcro acts as kind of a padding that makes it impossible to push or pull through the snap. Wanted this for casual use. I ordered it with the elite one that includes 2 magazine pouches. Skip this belt and just get that one it is much better.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/UTG-Heavy-Duty-Elite-Law-Enforcement-Pistol-Belt-with-Dual-Mag-Pouches/dp/B001WJ5EGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">UTG Heavy Duty Elite Law Enforcement Pistol Belt with Dual Mag Pouches</a>&nbsp;If I could get this belt to my size I think it would be great though. Very heavy duty. Unfortunately, I can't get the thing to adjust at all.
1,I thought this was going to be an awesome back up sight.  I found the large sight unusable or too big to take use of the diamond and the small sight washed out.  For me it was a waste of money.
1,XL size is rather bigger than I expected. I said this because I had compared two under armour t-shirts made it from different countries and found their measurement are not equal for the same size!! at least 1" or almost 2" the large and about the same in widht. And this is happening again with my short bottom. In my oppinion the first thing Under Armour should do it is to keep standardz about sizes and measurements otherway it seems a brand where specification products depend on manufacture countries. And you know what.. that doesnt smell good!!
1,The balance is never zero value. You can not calibrate, because it adds weight hooks!
1,This ripped the first time I used it.
1,I was skeptical about ordering compression socks by shoe size because I have a large calf.  These were too tight.  Nice material and lightly padded foot.  I wear a women's 9.5 or 10 shoe.  I ordered medium as instructed because of reviews that spoke of the footbed being sized.  The foot part felt wonderful but they were cutting the circulation off in my calf.  Wish they made these with a large calf.
1,The small nozzle is not very pump friendly.  I suppose it is better than sleeping directly on the ground, but not by much.  This will be the kids air mattress.
1,the case already ripped
1,Coming from a mother of 4 and a grand mother. Originally ordered because it is portable, the shoulder straps and offers shade.  I always like to purchase items that are appropriate for the child and offer a bit to grow into.  No paper work arrived with this item for a return.  This was purchased  for my 2.5 year old grandson to use and grow into.  He is on the tall size in the 90% for his age.  I was anticipating he would be able to utilize this for a few years, but now I am hoping he can use it at least a year now.  Very small size.  The product is a represented as picture, everything appears to be in working order.  The box it was delivered in, too big and flimsy.  Not a good value for someone attempting to be thrifty.
1,I am a dog lover , I have 3 large ones including a pit bull.  A loose pit bull came out of nowhere running at my dogs, now I am sure this was not ment for dogs but I literally soaked this dogs face with this stuff and I may have well sprayed it with a water pistol...Hey maybe it was not ment for dogs, I am just telling you what happened to me...
1,This Pack is way to small for hat I had in mind, but will be good for a child or a small woman.
1,doesn't fit!!!  Too large for ss cup!!!
1,TERRIBLE QUALITY!  First time using, pulled approx. 10 springs....pulling a spring, the shaft separated from the handle and shot across the customer's yard.  Piece of crap!  The seller e-mailed me a survey. I told them what happened...have not heard back from them.  If I could give zero stars, I would!
1,this thing is cheap, i bent this thing changing the floor plate on a glock 26 mag, don't waste your money
1,I have a love/hate relationship with BOB trailers: I love the idea, but I hate the company.		As a brief digression, their Ibex trailer is a total joke, IMO; if you're going to build a suspended trailer, make sure the suspension actually does something useful, or leave it off for weight savings.  The Ibex uses a complete POS coil spring with zero damping, that does little but make your trailer pogo idiotically off of every tiny bump.  It's a stupid design, and the people at BOB finally admitted to me that it does in fact suck, but said essentially that they couldn't make it any better for the market price they had to hit.  I don't buy that, but if so they should have simply not built it if they couldn't build it right.  It's a lousy compromise design, IMO.  And there's not even any kind of an upgrade kit for people who might be interested.  Someday I'd like to fit a real shock to my Ibex, but for now I just pity it.  /rant		  Anyway, if you need one of these skewers, you don't have much choice where you get it.  I don't mind the price, but I'd prefer to pay a couple bucks more for something that might look at home on a decent bike.  I haven't had one fail me yet, but it's not the most confidence-inspiring design.  Were they actively trying to maximize rattles and clunks, or could they seriously just not figure out how to make the attachment slop-free?  Oh well, too bad it's not nice and pretty and robust and precise and silent, but what matters is that BOB is making money.  I sure hope there's an alternative next time I'm ready for a new bike trailer, or I may have to build my own.
1,These came with the lenses popped out and I couldn't get them back in. What a bummer.  Back they went
1,Absolute piece of crap.  It worked **once** only.  Second time it bent both my presto valves.	NOT RETURNABLE.....	VERY FRUSTRATING
1,tried playing a game but everytime a corn bag landed the board moved an inch or two. The legs folded once and collapsed. sent the game back . It is a nice looking set but not intended for playing at regulation distances
1,Not very sturdy, I played with it in a open pastured no hard surfaces anywhere. After about 1 hour it split, not in 1/2 but in the middle, it separated. This is defiantly not worth the 18.95 I paid for it. Sorry Guys just not very sturdy.
1,too big for child
1,Too big. Uncomfortable fit
1,I started running in early August and would wear this on my wrist. The first one I received worked pretty well for about 2 weeks before it started to have trouble turning off or changing to flash (The button stopped working). It seemed that moisture would get inside of the unit near the button which caused almost like a burn mark on the inside. After this failure I sent it back and got a replacement, I figured it was just a fluke. Well, after 4 runs the same thing happened! This time I only ran with it on my skin once, the other times it was over the shirt sleeve. With the first unit I would be able to turn it off after about 8 hours. However with the 2nd one, it was locked into static light mode for three straight days.		I would not recommend this to anyone, and I'm peeved that I can't return the 2nd unit now. I wish there was a rating lower than "I hate it!"
1,Yep title says it all, just not a fan of weaver rail, purchased some scope rings to mount on there and there's just too much wiggle room and slack with it. It makes you really overtighten the scope rings to the base to keep it secure, even then you after many rounds you have to go back tighten them again. I love the Picatinny rail and hardware, they fit more securely.
1,Purchased a yellow and a blue for my 10 year old son, thinking he would progress after a time.  However neither individual board provides much challenge, and certainly do not replicate the real wood thicknesses they claim to.  Both boards can be broken by hand in mid-air with no support.  Only stacking them together comes close to being similar to a 3/4" board.  For adults even this is no challenge.  If you are considering these to simulate real wood go with the red or black, and be prepared to stack them.
1,Too hard to read.
1,I am slightly over 5'5 & weigh under 120lbs & this chair is still only big enough for cabbage patch doll or a micro dog, not a human being.
1,Knife has a nice design, but mine was totally dull out of the package. Maybe I just got unlucky, but it was still a hassle to have to ship it back, wait for a refund, etc...third world problem, I know, but I expect more from a "premier knife maker" who charges so much for such a small piece of metal. I will probably avoid Benchmade in the future because of this experience.
1,Waste of money as it washes terribly and takes too long to dry when normally using it. I sadly only used it once.  Wanted for hiking, theme parks, etc. but would never take this anywhere but the trash can.  Personally, I would not recommend this item.
1,Shot very erratic and inconsistent compared to the Superpoint and Superdome pellets.  Also, because of the flat point with very little taper, I found these pellets difficult to load.  I would not recommend these Super H-Point pellets.
1,This may work better in "office" settings, but I work on a ferry where it is sometimes cold out. My coffee was barely warm after 3 hours. I couldn't drink it. Needless to say I will have to send this back.
1,Does not sound like a dove.
1,Way smaller than what I was told it would be
1,I had to bend some of the inner components to get this to work. The light then died before I was done with one night of fishing (It lasted about 3 hours)
1,The frame is very flimsy and they run really wide which makes then uncomfortable is you have a rectangular head and not a ball shaped head.		If the they arms were adjustable/shapeable, this would be a 5-star review. Sadly I have replaced them with a different brand that fits my head much better.
1,This helmet is more for an 18mo to MAYBE a 2 YO, but don't make the same stupid mistake I did thinking it would fit because it says 3-5 & you are buying it for a 3 YO, so it would have to fit a 3 YO if it says 3-5.  I'm telling ya, it's a nice LOOKING helmet... & the concept of the easy adjustment is GREAT, however, beware that all you can adjust is the chin strap by adding maybe 3/4" more length... that is ALL!!  If you try & give it any more length in the strap than that, the strap falls out of the clip.  It does NOT fit like all of the other helmets that say 3-5... trust me, it doesn't!  It runs VERY small!!  Notice the reviews that are 5 stars & how they say it is for their TWO YO...		HUGE disappointment :(!!
1,The quality of the product leaves much to be desired. This item was described as for the AR15/M4, upon tightening the front screw which along the axis was cut in half(why i don't know) broke right off. the sighting was completely off i had to adjust my ACOG 27 clicks to the left from its original zero. This product is ONLY good for paint ball guns, not REAL guns. DO NOT BUY if you need a spacer for your M4/M16.
1,I searched this site for some dimensions before I bought it and all it specifies is 91 cu. inches...which is a bit hard to visualize.  What do people manage to put in this?  It's about the size of a paperback book, so I guess you could do that, but forget about a wallet and a cellphone in addition.  There's a tiny pocket on the side that seems like it might hold a leatherman tool or hex-key set, but nothing else.  I had hopes for a wallet, keys, cellphone and an e-reader.  Back to the backpack, I guess. This thing is very barebones.
1,the small pocket is too slim for my mask case AND snorkel to fit comfortably, and no chance at all to squeeze in my booties too.
1,Wrong color.  Ordered purple....the beautiful deep purple and received a pinkish purple.
1,Not much to say. Haven't had this in the woods. So the sheath belt loop has ripped already. Don't even know how. (1-14-2018) OK. Chopped a few saplings just now and they need to be small. My 2 star review still stands.
1,The bag is well made and looks like it would be perfect to hold both clothes and my mat. Unfortunately, the straps aren't long enough to hold two thin mats rolled together, even though reviews said they would. I'm trying to find some way to fix that, as I need just 3-4 more inches. This is an update: I just tried the Manduko Pro Lite with the bag. The straps are too short for that single mat. I have no idea what kind of mat you need to use this feature. Such a disappointment for the cost.
1,I got fooled on the size like others, tiny cans, look big in the picture, expensive price.  Shame on me for not reading the whole ad.
1,It turns out this is not for 5'4" people like myself.  The stride is WAY TO BIG for me.  I wish I could return it but I put 4 hours putting it together and have no idea how I would go about returning this.
1,Don't waste your money. The rods broke the very first cleanning. The case is the best part of purchase. Amazon should hault the sale of this product. I think this is the first bad review I have written, since I joined Amazon, and i think Amazon is the best!
1,Feels like they run about a size too small.
1,Not a good fit. It get in the way.
1,Just set this tent up and a stake cracked down the middle and broke.
1,Does not fit in my M1A,  could be the Springfield scope mount on the rifle.  Live and learn.  I may be able to cut it down to size.
1,Junk, never took a charge, ordered 2 neither would charge to the point that the STUN FUNCTION would work, returned them both.
1,You can barely read the screen , maybe a weak battery , but came that way the light switch not much better. Sorry liked it's look but thumb down
1,Arrived defective.  The stitching where the end is looped around the plastic part that you adjust isn't adequate.  I didn't even adjust the left side one time and it came apart like it was 100 years old.  Crappy workmanship for something $15.
1,Was hoping this would make a nice surprise gift, but didn't happen. Stitching along bottom of logo was clumped together, not like picture. Loose threading along top of hat. Color seemed off. Disappointed with look and quality of this above retail priced item.
1,I slept on this mattress every night until it failed. I weigh about 260. It was very comfortable mattress for me. After the first couple of days I only had to run the pump a couple of times a week. I put a thick "cool foam" pad added on top of it. One night some of the internal seams broke free with a Whomp! Strangely it did not leak even after that internal failure. Still, I did not want to sleep on a mattress with a 2 foot diameter hump in it.
1,This is what I received after waiting way too long to receive. Then I get a email scolding me for not contacting them first about my complaint. This is my 3rd email concerning this cheap piece of junk,enough time spent on this bad deal.
1,Too small - order two sizes larger next time
1,I ordered these for use during pregnancy due to varicose veins. I ordered a size larger than what I needed. These were very tight in the thigh. Unable to wear them.
1,It was great the first two times I used it...the insulated hose kept the water in the tube so much cooler.  However, the third time I went to use it the bottom valve started leaking.  No twisting or reinserting or anything helped, it still leaks.  Sending back for a refund.
1,After one assembly / disassembly I noticed a crack on one of the parts that hold the ladder rungs.  The parts were too tight for my wife to assemble or disassemble.		I should have listened to the comments that this was a cheaply built product.
1,The nose piece works great, however, it broken two weeks later after half-dozen uses. The product is very fragile when taking it on and off, but otherwise works very well. I suggest buying more than one at a time.
1,not very good to flimsy
1,Got a hole at the stitching just weeks after I bought em.
1,I was very excited to open the box and notice the quality of this slipper only to become completely deflated when I tried to put it on. It would not go halfway over my foot due to a major undersizing. I normally wear a 10.5, but ordered 11 to be safe. I feel that I would need at least a 13-14 for this slipper to even come close.
1,Very small. Undersized for weight advertised.
1,The plastic tip on the holder came off immediately.
1,Much bulkier than I expected.  I am sure they work great, but they are not comfortable or what I was looking for.
1,I installed them on my motorcycle and did a video review of them. No matter what speed I go they refuse to light up. They light up fine when I shake them, but don't work as designed.
1,For my Trek 8.3, They do NOT match the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) geometry ( they are round, not square like what the bike came with).  However, the OEM clip will hold them in place and they work well (for the couple miles I tested them anyway) on the front brakes, haven't tried them on the rears yet.  We'll see if they last 7K miles like the original ones did.  Dealer wanted $20 so for $8, seems like a good deal.
1,Have used 6 of them and 2 have not worked.
1,I use it but it doesn't seem like there's any change in the fogginess of my goggles. Been awhile since I've used it (or them), so I don't know if it's a good deal or not. $4, I can't really complain, any more than that is more than I care to spend for something that doesn't work.
1,Bought these for a Tough Mudder-type race. They fogged up immediately after the start, as I ran through the snowmaking guns. Then, whenever i was submerged, the water just came in behind them-no matter how carefully I tried to ease myself into the water. basically, they were worse than useless. To be fair, I can understand that they weren't made for running through water guns- but, they should have been able to withstand basic swimming and low-height diving. And what's up with the fogging? That was not only annoying but dangerous.
1,I ordered hoppe's precision lubricator 14.9 bottle. I recieved the prod. in 4 days, which impressed me to the max. However on opening the package I found the bottle almost empty. what was left in the i used to lubericate a hard to reach rail in my cz 75b pistol, it worked perfectly,so i returned it. when i recieve it back i will finish this report.		PS. The shipping was almost as much as the proudct. IF they return it it will still be a value to me.	UPDATE AMAZON REPLACED THE BOTTLES AND THEY WERE PERFECT I USE THEM AL THE TIME NOW.I WOULD RECOMEND THEM TO ANYONE NOW, ESPECIALY GUNSMITHS iT IS NOW A 5 STAR PLUS.
1,I am still not satisfied with the response from the company on this cup.  Over 10 years ago, I bought a cup similar to this that came in a leather case from Mori luggage,  I still have the cup to this day in my purse, it is very well made and I spent good money for it and it has more than paid for itself.  I had a plastic cup in my travel bag and lost it.  Imagine my excitement when I found stainless steel  cups on Amazon.  I was so happy when I found this collapsible cup on Amazon as any kind of collapsible cup is almost impossible to find in stores.  As excited as I was to get the cup, I was just as disappointed when I received it.  In fact, the cup is here on the table.  When I received it, the cup was detached from the bottom lid.  When I lifted the cup to its full height, it literally fell apart.  I contacted Amazon, who contacted the company and I have yet to hear from the company.  I am still working on getting satisfaction.  The cup is not that expensive, but it is the principle and my money.  And at the end of the day, I still want the cup.  I like the stainless steel for hygiene purposes and I want to have a cup that stays in my travel bag.  But I was so disappointed with the product falling a part in my hands.  I am still more than willing to work with the company as I just want a good strong and collapsible cup for my travel bag.
1,I received these today not what I wanted, these are 15 to 20 degree angle and it doesn't state that in the description. Not what I wanted. I want to wish straight down.
1,I just thought I was getting a different product...Not the manufactures fault.  Good product.  Just wrong part!
1,Would not stay on rib even when following mounting instruction, throwed it in the trash
1,Came without instructions.  I found instructions on youtube.		On the first pull the string broke.  I requested a refund and it is NOT eligible.  Wow.  Do not waste your money.
1,Do not buy these they don't last mine didn't fit into my arrows I had to put a piece of Scotch tape around him to get him to stay in first shots at the range one did break but the other five all the batteries came out on impact and slammed into the tip and broke the batteries my bow shoots 300 plus feet per second into a block brand Target at 30 yards I bought some other knockoff nocturnal ones on Amazon for 1090 and they are the sweetest and get red ones don't get blue ones they're impossible to see
1,The bag shown is not what arrived, these balls are too light to use and are are about a tenth of the weight of a usual ball
1,My wife hates them.  They are too high & she says they are "dorkie".  Got to be lower cut.
1,I bought these as a temporary backup sight for my M&P 15 until I could get the funds for the real thing (RTS by Duek Defense.). I could not zero them, the elevation was way off. It may vary from one rifles rail to another, but we are talking about feet off at 15 yards, which is airsoft quality but not for real steel. For an inexpensive backup get a mbus. Buyer beware.
1,I think this helmet will do what a helmet is supposed to do: protect my head the next time I crash (which seems to be happening more frequently lately, unfortunately). But here's the thing: This one-size-fits-all claim isn't true.		I have a big head. Not the biggest, but close. The other reviews led me to believe that it fit everyone. I even hoped I could wear a thin knit cap or baseball cap underneath. Um, no. It's tight even at the biggest adjustable setting. Not so tight I can't wear it, but tight enough to be a bit uncomfortable.		I am not going to return it. It will do. But I wouldn't have bought it if I had known that it's made for normal people, not big-head guys like me.
1,These suck. The neoprene is not reinforced and tears easy. As in the first time your wrap it on a glove.
1,I wanted to love this product. I bought a blow gun at the beginning of the summer and have had more fun with it than I thought I would. When I saw this product I thought it would just add to the enjoyment. The product broke in half as I was installing it. Very poor quality. This is not an injection molded product, it is made on a 3D printer and is very frail and brittle. I requested a refund right away. The company did not even attempt to send me another one.
1,The size and openings of this belt pouch is great, I can fit my iphone 7 in there along with sport beans. The buckle is huge though, and hurts my back when I wear it. The edges of this belt really scratch/itch my skin, so I keep trying to pull it down to stay over my running pants but it constantly shifts up to the center of my waist (no matter how tight/loose I make it). It probably wouldn't irritate skin if you're wearing high waist pants or wear it over your shirt, but I find it really annoying to wear belts over my shirts. But that still doesn't keep the belt from shifting up every 2 seconds.
1,These earplugs are mediocre at best. I bought these to replace a pair of nonoise ear plugs I had a while back, thinking maybe these would do the same job but better. Not at all.		The open/close plugs on them would be cool...if they actually worked. If you have the plugs open when you put them in, you'll end up basically vacuum sealing these earplugs to your ears, and then they're fairly painful to remove. If you have the plugs closed when you put them in, they won't seat right.		The little rubber piece around the outside of the plug is uncomfortable, and makes the earplugs dislodge every time my head moves. End result? I have to push the plugs back in every couple minutes, which is very annoying. After about an hour, the rubber piece gets quite uncomfortable, and I have to remove the plugs for a while just to give my ears a break.
1,Not to happy with this chain.  Not very happy with the master link.  You have to bend the chain in a slight "U" shape to undo the master link.  The link is one sided. This cause my chain to get an whop in it and now it occasionally skips.
1,$400.00 and it broke after 3 months (note how short their warranties are!)	Customer service offered me $30.00 off on the repair part (I pay shipping & handling and do the repair myself).	Horrible product with a hidden defect and because it is a bad company, they have bad customer service.	Go ahead and buy this model. Hopefully you won't have the issue with the freewheel hub so many others are having.
1,I returned this, I found it nearly impossible to get into the chair around the footrest.  I also tried unhooking the footrest, sitting in the chair and then trying to attach the footrest again but found that nearly impossible.  For an item whose sole purpose is relaxation, this wasn't relaxing for me.
1,I bought two of these at Performance bike shop because they were on sale. Smooth stems looked nice.	Both of them came apart at the seam. One lasted a few miles from home, another lasted little longer but otherwise more walking distance to home. I had a patch kit and a pump but no use. At least I got refund when took them back to the store. I explained the store clerk what had happened and he wasn't even surprised.	I had different brands of tubes mostly cheap store brand in the past but nothing compare to this. I was very surprised because this happened to well-known name.	What I learned from this. 1) Don't buy anything says ultra light. 2) Don't buy anything only because it's a well-known brand name, it was probably made by another company.	I weigh 140lbs, so the weight wasn't an issue, just in case you are wondering. I inflated it 120psi. Size of the tire was 700x20c.	You can avoid pinch flat snake bites by inflating the tire to certain pressure. If the tire picks up a broken staple, it gets flat but you can patch it. When the tube comes apart, you can't do anything specially if the spare you happen to have has the same defect.		I'll never buy it and I don't recommend this to anybody.
1,Not to bad only wore them a couple times so far.....the zipper on the front of it broke already
1,the sun destroy it
1,very small, not good quality
1,It held up and funtioned for awhile then the string broke and was a task to cock without a rope cocker.
1,Ordered 3 of these gun locks.  2 did not work at all.  Felt like a pressed tin toy instead of a decent lock.  Would no recommend at all.  Another Chinese made product that is not worth the effort.
1,Loose weave. My rods pop through alot.
1,Nice hat one of my favorites. But my old 47 large fit perfect...this one that says it is a large is to small. Also, more cheaply made than in the past.
1,The design rubs off so quickly it's not even funny.  In less 2 days of sparingly being used, it was already rubbing off.  Within 3 weeks, the Tardis was unrecognizable.  After a month, it was pretty much just an expensive blue water bottle.  I can pay a lot less for a regular blue water bottle.
1,It worked well, two or three times.  Then the head broke off.  It's held on by two little screws in very thin plastic, so it doesn't take much to break it.
1,I just want to explain to all females considering purchasing this product what happened and why this gun is inherently dysfunctional.  I just got ff the phone with Cory, a tech at the company.  I installed cartridges on August 23rd.  Worked great- shot it 3 times.  put it on my nightstand and went to practice September 4th.  Nothing happened.  Replaced the air cartridge and still did not fire.  So Cory explained that the cap sometimes does not puncture the cartridge.  So then why would it not work when I already had a punctured cartridge?  Well, he explains, air cartridges can go bad.  SERIOUSLY?  In 2 weeks?  So if I am depending upon this as I would a gun, I constantly have to check to see if it is firing?  Do you know how much that would cost?  I am done. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I spent over $400 with accessories.
1,When I finally needed it, the CO2 in the cartridge had already leaked.  My suggestion would be NOT to put the cartridge in until it is to be used.  And carry 2 cartridges.  One doesn't do it for 60 PSI.
1,It looks better on the website but its a very thin light product. It looked more thicker online. Better for skinny people.
1,Wow! At first I thought they were great, very durable and no blowouts whatsoever! But after they are cooked they simply split and shrink hanging off each end of the sausage like a used rubber on prom night ! Never again
1,Very light.  Had to return.
1,I can hear it vibrating at times
1,The base is flimsy, it feels cheap and the packaging it comes in, does not make it easy to store once you are finished with it.
1,Mine arrived with a bent bottom plate at the mount on the post.  While it doesn't seem to negatively impact the flame, it does force everything to slant while resting on top.  I've have other Primus items and always had good luck.  This one seems to be a cheap P.O.S.		I wouldn't recommend buying these.
1,Be very careful as they have changed their product.  I'm not sure if they changed the package contents or not but mine didn't come with the cadence sensor magnet case, just a single small magnet in a small ziploc bag with a small B&W photocopy picture of a magnet on a crank arm that states to place the small magnet on your crank arm and it should stay in place all on its own.  Seriously?  Did they do away with the protective case for the magnet that was secured to the crank arm?  One piece of debris hits the magnet and it's gone.  No thanks, this is going back.
1,These almost never eject in my Walther P99. They don't show up as 'loaded chamber' either. That is because the diameter of the base of the case is just a tad smaller then the standard 9mm Luger. Feeds fine though.		Also, as mentioned by many, these leave tiny brass shavings all over the pistol internals. So after just 10-15 minutes of practice you have to clean up the gun (not real cleaning like after range session, but still)		They are probably fine to be used for dry-fire so that your firing pin drops on something (as long as you clean those brass shavings). But would it kill the manufacturer to make the bottom of the case actually match the 9x19 Luger spec, and change the brass type to be more like the real shell casings?
1,I should of read the product info a little closer.....these bands don't stretch.  I need some long strechy fitness bands.  To use this bands for stretching isn't that simple either....you have to wrap the band around your legs or arms and then pull....the band won't stay in place unless you keep constant tension on it.
1,After reading reviews I expected better. This stock performs no better than socks 1/2 the price. Very disappointed.
1,Siminlar to a few others, the first time I used them, the seam came open spilling the filling everywhere and I had to throw it away.  Originally, I loved these when they arrived but they ended up being a waste of money - very disappointing!
1,returned this because the wrong product arrived.
1,Not what I wanted
1,I purchased this laser for an M6/AR15.  My DPMS has a short rail on the top of the gas block in front of the handguard, well centered over the barrel.  I found this same sight at WalMart and decided to go for it while I waited on the one from Pyramyd Air/Amazon to ship.  The aluminum set screws, even with red or blue LockTite, will not remain secure enough to hold zero after as few as 10 rounds of .223.  There is a huge selection of these type products out in the market, which I feel are really intended for airsoft, paintball, or ???  In no way shape or form are these items "weapons grade."		After looking extensively, I believe your best bet is to look at products from LaserLyte, Crimson Trace, etc.  Most of these will be starting near the $100 mark and are much better built.  Also there is a disco'd red laser model from Nebo Tools under the ProTec name for under $50, and it is a much superior product to this.  CenterPoint optics have a pretty good reputation for decent quality at budget cost, but they missed the mark completely with their lasers.
1,Old dented up product
1,looking at the other customer reviews, I thought this might work for adults, but it really is just for kids or extremely tiny adults. It would be nice if the company provided a sizing chart with actually measurements of knees, elbows, etc
1,These goggles have a fairly large plastic buckle on the back of the strap, so they will not fit on my helmet since the back of my helmet has a notch to keep the goggle straps secure.  Many helmets have this, so goggle manufacturers should not design goggles with large buckles at the back!  Certainly if you are going to put a big buckle on the back of the strap, don't market the goggles as helmet compatible.  The box actually says they will work with helmets.  They would be fine for skiers who do not wear helmets and really seemed designed much more with those skiers in mind.  I did like that they fit over my glasses very well.  I'm very disappointed that I have to send them back.
1,I thought it was great when I got it.		However, I left the CO2 cartridge in and the seal deteriorated and leaks. I called Crossman and all they said that I would have to buy the whole valve assembly which is not installable without special tools!		They also gave me a phone number for a repair dealer but hardly think it worth for the cost of the new unit.		I have a Daisy Power line 93 which has never given me seal problems despite leaving the cartridge in the unit. I have had this for over 15 years and it still functions.		I will keep the C41 as a display only!
1,I thought this was for river water, its only for tap water. Also only one filter for each bottle & only 40 refills.
1,I purchased size small for my 4 year old.  I followed what I read and it seemed like size small should fit him, but it didn't. the ankle portion is too small.  I decided to purchase size medium of this same brand and it fit him perfectly.  By the time I got to Amazon to try to return it (a little over 30 days),  I was told I could no longer return it because the time period for return was up.
1,Made in China. Poor stitching quality. This item will get you killed. I wouldn't trust it with a $1 water gun, let alone outside.
1,The mug its self is great. No complaints whats so ever. The lid is the main factor for only 2 Stars. I have gone through 3 of these in the past couple of months. Each and every lid on each mug has broke. Im guessing its a design problem. The push button just falls off. Ive tried super glue to fix the problem, but than that falls off after a couple of times in the dishwasher. I love the mug itself, but the lid has a lot of issues.
1,Trash, works for all of 5 minutes, and never works again.
1,I'd heard great things about Opinel, so I thought I'd try one.  My expectations were fairly low, considering the price point, so I was surprised when I was still very disappointed by the quality of this knife.  The blade was actually blunt in places, not just dull.  The blade also felt very thin and without any shape.  Because of the flat, sheet-metal nature of the blade, if felt very fragile.  The handle was rough and un-sanded around the edges, almost splintering on the corner.  The folding and locking mechanisms felt loose and flimsy.  The locking collar is ludicrous.  It flexes when you turn it, like a paper clip.		Sadly, every part of this knife felt cheap and unreliable.  I've owned knives at the same price point that I love to use, and trust with hard work, but I'll never buy Opinel again.		Seller was great and took return without fuss.
1,Defective product or design. It has a straw inside but only got air sucking on spout.  Tried it with the inner straw removed and using it like a water bottle but still got air along with some liquid. In the process of returning it now.
1,Second time they were used, the plastic claps (female side) broke - the entire side of the clasp broke off rendering them useless.  The plastic is quite thin and will break.  I would have expected a thicker plastic for protective gear that is intended for pretty rough usage.
1,I bought this because of the reviews. I can not see what others saw in this. (1) This measures from the floor 41" at maximum, not 51", so false information. (2) Instructions are minimal and poor (also on other reviews), are translated badly on the side of the box, and are mostly pictures that don't match the pieces but at least represent them. (3) You must provide your own weight system, but this was expected. (4) Quality of materials are very sub-par. Assuming this is played with, and not by the person it was intended for due to it being short, this will not last long. (5) The pump was easily broken, cracked right down the side and the tip broken off where the plastic needle screws in, again, due to lack of quality. (6) The spring broke after 3 minutes of the children using it. I am returning this product. It is awful. A waste of $37.
1,This pack is extremely well made like all the other Maxpedition products that I have.  The only drawback for me was that it was too small, more equivalent to a women's clutch purse vs. a EDC bag.  Upgraded to a Noatak to increase carry capacity of water bottle/travel coffee bottle, Kindle, iPod, etc.
1,Not as cool as it looks.  Very thin.  Cheap blade.  It's not a toy,  but it feels like one.  Disappointing.
1,I am very disappointed with this watch cap. It is way to small. I ordered the Lg/Xl. I'm 5'10 180 pounds and wear a 7 1/8 hat. It covers my head but does not cover my ears. It reminds me of one of the old sleep caps that were issued with the military cold weather sleeping bags.		I am giving this 1 star because I expected better being this was 5.11 brand AND that I paid nearly 20 bucks for this worthless piece of cloth.		Do yourself a favor and get one of the Condor Tactical one size fits all watch caps! They are good quality fleece and they will cover your ears at least. They are also priced significantly lower and the quality is excellent.		The material on this hat is fine its just way too short.
1,Fit as expected but the seams are so big All 3 shirts rub my under arms so bad that I cant wear them. Cant return them so I just have to eat the shirts.
1,Great for tossing in the school bag, holds up well, dishwasher safe, easy to use.  Glad I bought these.	*****I am revising this as they only last a couple months before they start leaking.  They're cute and hold a good amount of water but don't last.  I suspect it may have been dropped (they're marketed for kids, they're likely going to be dropped) or handled a little roughly in/out of the backpack, but that doesn't mean it should not have been made more durable.  Although it is not the same, I experienced the same with their insulated stainless travel mug.  Has the same mechanism, but started leaking after a short fall -- which can be problematic when you're throwing it in the same bag as a cell phone.  So because of their lack of durability and unexpected leaking, I am reducing the rating to 2 stars.  I like the idea of these, but can't afford any more leaks.
1,This is for smaller people. I am 6'1" male 185lbs and this barely fits over my chest.
1,Do not waste your money.  The problem with this is that the rungs don't stay put on the straps, so if you misstep and hit the rung while you're doing drills, the rung slides and you have to stop and reset it.  Spend the extra $10 for the skilz agility ladder that has the fixed rungs.
1,Really not needed. Impulse buy
1,I bought this exact same shirt in XL a couple years ago. Still have it, still run in it, fits GREAT. I have broad shoulders and a small waist.  Ordered a new one in XL (silly me) and it fits like a TENT...this thing is HUGE...and I mean HUGE!  It's a great product (when you can find the correct size)  but the changing in how the sizes run drives me nuts.  Sending this one back and will try a large.
1,The quality was very good for the price.  I don't really like this hat because I realized it makes my head quite hot and I don't feel any relief from the hot sun.  I think it would be better if it had ventilation holes in the top, which is a trade off because you would get some sun (on your hair) but allow the trapped heat out.
1,Not satisfied.
1,I'm disappointed already.  Just got the scope today and the piece of rubber on the eyepiece has a tear in it about 1/3" and there is a rubber gasket that seems out of place on the windage turret.  I paid all this money for what I thought was a good scope and I guess I was wrong about Leupold.  Didn't anyone check the scope in quality control before they put it in a box and sealed it?		What a bummer?  I'm thinking of returning the scope now.
1,good for less than two hours in rain
1,These compression sleeves are a very thin material not unlike spanx  but less support. You'd do better with walgreens than thes. I have gone used Walgreens in a pinch so I have experienced them. Really believe that these are really unsupportive. 2xu makes a better one which is medical grade in an array of colors I had to go to my local run store for them but you might find them in the amazon, and those are thicker and spot on support.
1,Ripped instantly when I tried to put it on my glock22 instant fail :(***** maybe its my own error but I was gentle as F and it still tore on me.
1,It does not come with a pepper cartridge. Poorly constructed.  Buy from the Mace web site directly.
1,Looked ok,  but fit is too tight around my ears. I thought the flexabilty would be better. Returned.
1,I had to use 100mph tape to make the surefire G2X Tactical wide enough in diameter to fit. (Not good) Then the lock in pin for the rail system broke; The spring came loose and the pin came out. Needless to say this heap of crap is not something you want to be depending on at night.
1,Great idea poorly executed. These things are junk and are particularly useless for road bike tubes 700 X 25 or less. Inevitably the tube molding lines	will be patched along with the puncture because of the size of the patch. That is the weak link, as the Super Patch will not adhere to the areas adjacent to the molding lines and allows for a leak in that area. After multiple attempts to repair a puncture (involving removal of the rear wheel, patching the tube, replacing the rear wheel, airing the tire) only to find that the patch leaks is more than a little frustrating, particularly if the source of air is co2 cartridges (I don't carry a box of 9).
1,Not as pictured, no brass in this turd. One guy say's too much camoline but mine had none and was rusted up pretty good. Dropped it in the trash on the way from the mailbox, not putting that in my beautiful SKS. I don't care if it is original where's the cleaning kit to clean the cleaning kit LOL.
1,These XL gloves fit nicely... I'm 6'-3", 200lbs and have average hands for someone my size. But these gloves are going back. There was a defect in the pair I received. Stitching on the index finger of the left glove needs work. Actually, the quality of the stitch work (threads) appears fine, but the alignment of the fabric is off, exposing an unprotected white strip which would soak up moisture like a sponge and inevitably leave me with a cold soggy finger.
1,It may work fine for running, but for cycling, especially road cycling, it really did not work well for me at all.
1,I wasn't expecting much of this item for the price. I just wanted to have something cheap that would do the work. They are confortable but as you can see on the picture the pad on the corner of the palm goes around your hand, not really, it actually sticks out to the side making my hand look squared.
1,This Dye Precision item is NOT true to size.  XXL Is more like L and the L/XL is more like M. The styling is very attractive but be aware how small it runs.
1,I bought this heart rate monitor for my wife so she could monitor her HR while jogging and with her aerobic classes. The HR monitor would never work she would have to stop what she was doing and it would take a minute or so to get a reading it would go from 60bpm while she is perfoming an aerobic activity to like 170 or there wouldnt even be a reading...it was so frustrating. She tried it several times with the same results. Didnt matter where the chest strap was placed...I've been an amazon customer for a long time and was very disappointed.
1,thin fabric not very warm
1,item was different to the one advertised
1,Junk broke out of box
1,I returned them both. The biggest piece of crap, all plastic. I should have known better based on the price. Darn shame I remember Crosman being a good product.
1,The item comes in a cheap plastic box. The box gets the job done, it just has that made in China feel. It has what you need in it, but I immediately broke the brush, which is the most important part. The brush became detached from the extender. Basically this means that I can only use the brush on the first two inches of each end of the barrel. It cannot go through any deeper without getting stuck in it. I hope I can return it.		UPDATE: I was contacted by Amazon and given a refund for this product, so at least you can rest assured that the Amazon customer service is top notch. I didn't even call them, they must have just come across my review and decided to help me!
1,seat bushing is way to loose, makes seat feel unsafe, would not purchase again. spend extra money and get a good one..
1,The unit arrived before expected delivery date.. that's the good news.  Take it out of the box and out falls a bag of tools...OK.  Notice says that the unit is fully assembled so why the tools.  I had to install the unit that goes against the real wheel.  No big deal, but there are no instructions to do that.  The unit is fully assembled right?????.  Once put together it works fine.  Just what I wanted.  The vendor should know what he is selling.  Fully assembled my big toe.
1,Admittedly, I can be stupid at times.		Most of the time. In the workplace, of course, I'm usually wrong because i do the kind of work that is judged subjectively. Somehow that usually leaves me the cheese standing alone to fix what I've been told was wrong, while the "judges" take each other to lunch or go home for the evening. But I digress.		I thought this device was supposed to be the device I see the lovely Ms. Lyons using, getting trimmer and more buff even while she's in a still picture. But know this: the item itself is merely the connector to the bands and handles. My error because I didn't understand that. Silly me, I thought all that other stuff sort of unfolded from the thingy I saw in the picture.		Perhaps it might have been noted -- for pumpkinheads like me -- with the words "for use with." Feel free to tell me to change this sentence subjectively.		Anyway, I held the item behind my shoulders and flexed. It was nice for my tense, fatigued back. So it does have a use on its own, I guess.		Just know, this is a very sturdy well-made anchor that holds other stuff to exercise tightly as soon as you get that other stuff.
1,There almsot zero bacon in here. Very, very little bacon. and it's in tiny, tiny little pieces. Pretty disappointed. Still good for what it is, but I'll stick to the Breakfast Griddle instead of this one. Was really hoping for bacon tho.
1,I don't know what Nalgene is doing, but the newer "wide mouth" bottles are not compatible with the available Sipper Caps.
1,Just got mine, 1 of the 2 alarms is incomplete. Not satisfied with this item
1,I used it on an ar 15 with 5.56 round. After shooting 60 rounds, the reticle has shifted right significantly. You can use this with flip up iron sight. This is just a cheap temporary measure for me and would not recommend it.
1,Zipper would not work.
1,fit was dicey - width wise was fine, but opening for fingers was very tight and uncomfortable.  also, the cushioning really bothered me at the base of my fingers, so I unfortunately returned these.  going back to using my road gloves with more subtle gel cushioning for the time being.
1,Cheap is all i can say.
1,The band has a lifetime guarantee but the seller has disappeared.  The band broke completely.	We bought the purple band. Everybody in the family has tried it- from the 7-yr-old (50 lbs or so) to dad (210 lbs). It's plenty strong enough, helps everybody do more pullups, and we don't feel nervous about it breaking or wearing out. Winner.
1,sounds like a party favor i guess i should have spent more
1,I was going to purchase one of these, but after reading the reviews, I won't.  I have 10 rifles and nearly as many pistols, so	this would never work, and with that quality, I don't think it would take the weight of the weapons and bullets in the cabinet.	Thanks for stopping me from making a mistake.	Jim
1,'Allergic Reaction' from rubber nose pieces; Buyer beware!! I have NEVER had any allergic reactions - to anything rom consumer products in 45 years. The rubber nose pieces on these sunglasses have caused a MAJOR skin irritation and/or burning - and thus cannot be worn. The 'polarization' of the lenses are clearly subpar if nonexistent in general. Not at all impressed with these glasses. Induced allergy issues causes these to be worthless and thus cannot recommend these. I will compliment one thing concerning the glasses: they come with a very nice hard case, lens cleaning cloth and are comfortable. Beyond a couple minutes and the skin irritation from the rubber starts to burn.
1,They will NOT fit a 1" hole, VERY MISLEADING!!  Otherwise probably OK, but should specify min/max size! I'd ask for money back, but too big a hassle.
1,I bicycle 20 miles round-trip to work, so when the temperature is below freezing I need to use toe warmers. I bought some Hotties at Modell's and am not satisfied. At 35 degrees, the toes still feel cold, and at 20 degrees the Hotties are worthless. A much better brand is the GRABBER toe warmer -- they keep the toes warm even at zero degrees!
1,It look like something a dog vomit up with worms  i have had this in washington dc and it was good  but this was so desgustion i took 3 bite and dumped it the river no flavor and just mushy
1,Returned.  Not comfortable, doesnt hold guns well.		Pass.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.  I have had several people test this fire piston and only one could make a fire ember.  I am a  Ret. USN  Survival Equipmentman ( para-rigger '59-82') with 12 yrs. SERE-P.O.W. Inst. duty  plus 3 yrs. as a JEST jungle survival Inst. in the Philippines, having trained over 100,000 students in 40 yrs.  I first saw the fire piston in 1965 , used by the Negrito people - and brought it to the USA in 1975.  I have several dozen types from around the world . The fire pistons has been in my DVD of skills for yrs. - I do NOT have a patent - and it has been copied by many people.  "Wilderness Solutions"  is the only mfg. that I would bet my life on .  I am EXTREMELY  disappointed with the "BE Fire Piston" from "Bushcraft-Essentials" .  I am trying to return the unit and requesting a refund.  They have NOT answered my e-mails and have no phone # or address it seems - here in the USA ?  Their product is NOT a " life saving survival tool."  Sincerely - with warning - BEWARE - "Mountain Mel" - Deweese, age 72 .
1,Blurry red dot is all I can say. Now sitting in my junk pile before even put on a shotgun and fired.
1,Probably on par with the free bag you get when joining the NRA. I wasn't impressed. Ended up returning it.
1,I actually really like this bag. It's comfortable, durable, and fits a surprising amount of stuff. However, after only a week of using it on my SE Asia trip, the black canvas began to bleach in the sun, turning a good portion of the bag an unpleasant orange color. It seems to be only getting worse. When I emailed Pike to Peak about this defective product, they didn't even get back to me, so as you can imagine I'm quite disappointed, especially since this bag was not cheap.
1,I got a medium and I'm 130 pounds and it was really lose on me you might want to consider going a size down.
1,It is okay.  Quality is lacking and it is just neoprene, no insulation.  It does the job, but not an excellent product.  Some of the stitching has failed already (without even using it), I will be sending it back.
1,I could see how this would be comfortable as a cot, but it is really uncomfortable to sit in any of the other positions and use it like a lounge chair.  You slide down it when it's in the upright position making it really uncomfortable.  It's also not really as easy as it should be to adjust the position.  And you can't adjust it while you're sitting in it.  I bought it because I wanted a lounge chair for the back yard that could go all the way flat (the zero gravity chairs can't do that) and I thought this was it.  But unless all you want to do in it is lie down, I wouldn't recommend buying it.
1,The door is a pain in the neck to open and close securely.
1,Not made for fat guys. Velcro is really cheap.
1,Takes too long from the time it senses movement until it actually starts to record. Misses too much.	Movies are OK as long as the subject is still but all movement is blurred to the point that you cannot see anything clearly.	Night photos are dark as this camera does not light the area up sufficiently.	Skip this one - it's useless.
1,product it self looks fine and works good, but when you look closer on the picture, it opens differant direction, it will be hard when you hand cuff somebody and you try to open the hand cuff.
1,I have a small face, so I was looking for ladies swim goggles.  They are small enough over my face, but as some other review mentioned, the lenses are really close to the eyes.  Which makes them a bit annoying when you blink.  I would not buy another pair.
1,This is the cheap model.  Don't waste your money on this, spend the extra $2-3 and get the better model.  Once dipped in hot water, the sides folded over on themselves and I was never able to get the proper fit.  Shock Doctor products are great, just not this one!
1,Material felt a bit flimsy. Orange was to neon for my taste.
1,I don't presently have a watch, and the fact that this was a waterproof sport watch had some appeal. Unfortunately  I think it is really too big. It is nearly 3 times the size of a standard regular watch, and it looks mannish even pink. It comes shipped loose inside a small  box, with no instructions. There is a lot of plastic in the band and watch, making me wonder if they couldn't have slimmed it down some. If you like a bulky watch this might work for you, but for me, it seems overdone. When I showed it to my co-worker, she said it was the ugliest watch she had ever seen and I agree. I would feel self conscious wearing this huge thing.
1,Sometimes the tracker is right most of the time more wrong than right
1,It is as advertised. Problem is. with the Mossberg. it takes a gunsmith to install it. If you just remove the screw the whole mechanism falls apart. Yep. I did that. I'm a Harley mechanic. I take things apart and put them back together. Not this time. I needed help. Product is fine. Installation? good luck. they could warn you about that.
1,Darn near impossible to use.  Windage L/R moves after every shot. Impossible to maintain zero.	Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
1,Wanted to love this bottle but it leaks. Ended up returning it.
1,did not fit
1,item came damaged. 2 of the 4 brass pins were broke off making it completely unusable.		too bad too, since I usually like UCO products.
1,Pros: thick and cushy, lovely colors, easy to clean, eco friendly.		Cons: mat surface pattern causes poor grip especially with sweaty hands. Small chunks of material began flaking off with six months of once or twice weekly usage. Grippy only with a damp towel over, which defeats the point of a non slip mat.		I purchased my PROLite mat almost a year ago because of the glowing Amazon reviews and followed Manduka's break in instructions to the letter (other than the sea salt thing. Couldn't see how destroying the mat's surface would make it grippier!). It's always been a bit slippery but as I don't sweat a lot, I attributed this to its newness and my inexperience. With months of improved technique, the mat is only slightly less slippery. Hot yoga and vinyasa are equally treacherous with this mat.		I finally got tired of wrenching my shoulder girdle in down dog and purchased a Jade Harmony mat. Had my first session with the Jade yesterday and found that it's not only truly sticky, but the surface pattern renders excellent grip. I got rid of my PROLite immediately and I'm not going back. Don't waste your money like I did!
1,This mat is to soft for yoga. It leaves deep imprints of your feet and hands and makes it hard to balance. The mat slid  as did my hands and feet. Such a disappointment. If you want a true yoga mat spend the money on a manduka and skip this one
1,As other mentioned, the plastic patch holder broke on the first use.  I have to return it right away.  If you want to keep this kit, you need buy another copper patch holder.
1,too small.
1,This is a very cheap leash that gets tangled easily. I use other leashes on other boards that are much better.
1,Extremely flimsy. I'm not sure if the pack I received were a lemon or the normal, but I can snap these in half with minimal pressure from my thumb.
1,It fit my bike well and covered it for five months. Then the bike fell over, and the handelbar punched right through the cover. In trying to take the cover off, it was ripped to shreds. Very flimsy material, not worth bothering with!
1,These micro towels are probably the worst microfiber towels that I have ever used. They quickly become saturated with water. A total waste of your money.
1,Protect your hands from scrapes, but the quality overall is a little low. Straps have started falling apart and I'm looking for replacements.		Great great great for the price, but overall I wouldn't recommend these if you're looking for longer lasting gloves.
1,Good size for summer runs, with a small pouch for jellys or gu's.  However, if you use something like sticky in your water, the leaking will run your run.  Crappy little washer that stretches out too easy.
1,It came with a broken bracket, unuseable
1,These work, advertised with 30db reduction BUT on the range my 4" 44special is much, much sharper a CRACK than the muffled BOOM standard muffs provide, appears the higher frequencies aren't reduced much and it's uncomfortable to use extensively for gunfire.
1,Make sure you realize before you purchase this item that the reason its 50lbs is because that bow there is full steel....so stringing it yourself is going to take some doing....a lot of doing. It's a okay item to have. I use mine to shoot small game off the back porch works nicely. However if the bolts are not on just right the string with come up over top of the arrow and will start damaging the string. I've had this item for less than a year and it has unstrung on me twice (those string holders are crap; I had to modify those special to better hold the string). the string itself is not that formidable I have had to re-wrap the center several times. I am almost due for a replacement string and I have barely used it. Oh and first couple shots the clip that holds the bolt down snapped clean off...I had to melt the thing back on. Not a precision item but okay to have and play around with. Some assembly and modification required.
1,I purchased  this  a while  back  for  a trip  that  I  did this  summer , after  reading  the  review  I  was  convinced  that  this  was  the  bag for  me , but  the  only  good  thing , was  that  I  was  able  to  take  it  on board  the  aircraft . I went  on a two  week  trip  and not  a hole  lot was I able  to take .  Maybe  if it had  more  pockets ,  I  would  have  been  able  to  pack  more  things  and not have  to  bring  2 bags instead  of  one .
1,I really wanted to love this product, but the bottom side seams on both sides separated in the first two days of use. Once they started coming apart, you could easily extend the opening with minimal force.  These are simple lap seams and I am not sure what is supposed to be holding them together.  I did not see any stitching, adhesive, nor evidence of any kind of thermal welding.  I have to think that there must have been some kind of change in the manufacturing process that was not thoroughly vetted.	I was fortunate in that my trip was a flat water canoe trip, and the bag was not exposed to an serious water exposure.  If I had purchased this bag for a trip involving any form of whitewater, I would have been scrambling.	If you do buy this bag, take it on a test trip that will end before your 30-day return period expires.
1,So I originally purchased :	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UMFT22/ref=oh_details_o03_s02_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1		And I liked it so much, but decided I wanted a little more resistance in it, so I found this model made by Prohands as well, and this was listed as heavy tension, compared to my current medium tension unit.		Upon arrival, not only it is smaller than the 1st one, it is a joke tension wise compared to my medium tension unit!	Only differences I can tell between the 2 units units besides size are the sizes of the springs and the medium unit has "PRO" on it.
1,They dent and don't hit well
1,sent back, made my butt hurt
1,Quality of the product is substantially compromised from its picture on the site
1,Difficult to setup, sags at the ends and ends outside legs slip.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Does it work, yes but I don't recommend it.  Spend a little more for a decent one.
1,Runs small
1,Very disappointed. I have a set of 9mm Lee carbide dies, they are GREAT! I thought these would be similar, however I've had nothing but issues, I cant even get past the sizing stage.		I got these dies, my sizing die's decapping pin looked slightly off center, but I didn't think anything of it. My very first clean, wet tumbled, lubed, Winchester .223 casing went it with some effort, it came out extremely scraped up (beyond use). Second casing, I used case wax instead of lube, just enough, and it got completely stuck, a sludge hammer and punch couldn't even dislodge it. I called Lee, they basically said it sounded like it was my fault that the casing was stuck. Nevertheless, they said I could send it to them and they'll dislodge it or send a new die. I paid $3.50 and waited 2 weeks to ship out/receive it. Turns out that the die was faulty, they sent me a brand new one. The second die, I did the same, the case went in and came out with little effort. I was very happy, but then I noticed major scratches along side of the case. I did a few more, same issue. Called them again and they said I can ship this one back to them.		Upon inspection, there were some pretty bad scrapes and burrs inside of the die, left from tooling. They didn't polish the die, they didn't finish it, it looked as if they tooled the die, blew it out and shipped it, zero quality control.. I tried polishing it myself, it didn't help, the burrs are too large and strong to take out. The other two dies I believe are fine and I plan on using them, however I will be buying myself another (different brand) sizing die.
1,Same quality product without the Eurika name, you can get at any "big box" sporting goods store for half the price.
1,I bought an XXL in this, and it was more like a M/L.  The pattern was nice, but this tank is not made for ladies with breasts. Bummed that I had to return it.
1,You better off getting the ones they use at the gym,  The ball doesnt hold u very well and the small cm balls at the gyn are just as good
1,Super tiny fits 2 medium sized pills if that
1,Had these for a little over a month and the lens coating is wearing off.  I kept them in the case while not using them, and I haven't worn them much!  Also not as comfortable as the Duco sunglasses which I highly recommend!
1,I could not find a comfortable location on my waistband for this holster. They say to break it in but in the meantime, your midriff is raw.
1,What makes these a 2 star is the price but if I had to judge it by quality, this would be a 1 star rating.		First, I got 11 edge pieces v 12, one edge is missing a "tooth", so I can only use 10. Also, I realized the 2x2 squares have a pattern that should be matched up with the next piece, but I only found 3 of the squares I could match up. From a small distance, the pattern on 3 joined pieces were not straight, with one off and looking crooked. The joints could not by any stretch of the imagination be considered "tight" when you can look down and see flooring. I cannot see them lasting very long without coming apart. If you're looking to use these in a toddlers play area, the price and life expectancy would be perfect. But for an exercise room or play area for +6 YO, no way these will stay together.		These compared to other "exercise" flooring is quite a bargain, but quality wise, I'd pay for better and be happy in the long run!!!
1,Good idea. Needs more work to the design. With a gun in, holster wants to flip top into the body.
1,I am highly disappointed in this product. I own another "regular" Boresnake and use it frequently on my AR-15 with no issues and love it. However this Viper version (for .308 / 7.62) was extremely disappointing as the plastic bore cone became immediately lodged in the chamber of my AR-10 when I first used it. After knocking it out with a gun cleaning rod I again attempted to use it, this time with more caution and attention. Again the same result. After removing the plastic bore cone, I was quite happy with it's results as it does have more bore bristles to aid in scrubbing the barrel. However, I gave this product only 2 stars as I had to modify something in order to make it work correctly when it should have worked out of the box. Save your money and purchase the "regular" Boresnake or plan on slitting and removing the bore cone on the Viper.
1,Everything about this purchase from Joe Driver was wrong. When I orginally made the order I was told that they had the Cressi Titanium Reg was  in stock. After they checked I was told that they had to get in from Cressi. I waited weeks for my Reg. I was given the option to cancel my order. This is where I went wrong.		When I got Reg the hose was too short so I ordered a MyFlex hose. The Reg would leak out air if I turned my head to the left. When I kept my head straight it worked fine.		When I went on my 3rd dive trip with this Reg it free-flowed air on my first dive. I couldn't get the air to stop flowing. On my second dive I hooked the Reg to my BC and used my secondary. The Reg was still free flowing air. When I got back on the boat one of the deck hands offered to check the Reg. He found out that their was rust inside and the valve wouldn't close. I borrowed someone else's Reg for my last 2 dives.		I sent the Reg back to Joe Driver in December for them to send the Reg back to Cressi for warranty repair.		Today I got a call from Joe Diver saying that Cressi  wouldn't fix or replace the Reg since the deck hand opened it up and tried to clean it.		When I called Cressi and spoke to Al he was very rude to me. He told me that the Cressi logo was also worn out and there rust inside that kept the value from closing. Al actually became belligerent with me. So I also became argumentative. The conversation got ugly.	I strongly believe that I received a returned Reg from Cressi through Joe Diver. Al also hung up the phone on me. (Not professional or acceptable)	When I called back to speak with Mike the CEO of Cressi. I was finally told that they would refurbish my Reg for $90-100. but they would not guarantee me that I would have my Reg back for my next dive that is scheduled for January 25th.		When I called Joe Diver to update them on with happened with Cressi the CS rep offered to refurbish the Reg for $65. and she was told by Cressi that I would have the Reg back before the 25th. She then called Cressi to get everything going. She called me back to inform me that Cressi would not honor their corporate price with Joe Diver.		This is the worst experience I have ever received by any company. I was warned by a friend that Cressi does have the worst warranty repair of all of the items they carry in their store. Unfortunately I was given this warning after I orderes my Reg.		I strongly recommend that you do not purchase anything from Joe Diver or any Cressi products since they could give you an item that was returned by another customer and nor repair it once you send it back to them.		Completely unacceptable from when I first placed this order.
