0,Great deal for the number of hoops.  The large one has a bit of a gap between the two hoops, causing the fabric to slip easily, regardless of how tight or loose I make it.
0,As described, been using it to make hairpin lace and don't have any complaints!
0,Looks very beautiful.
0,This tool comes with finer needles for needle felting. That is great for quickly finishing pieces, but I still use a couple of heavier guage needles for joining pieces together. The pen shape is comfortable to hold, and I have not stabbed myself yet (good control). Just be warned that this is for finer work, and heavier needles may be needed to do larger projects (they can be fitted into the pen if they have the right angled tops).
0,Not surprisingly, it looks, feels and works exactly as I imagined chalk would.
0,Awesome quality adhesive backed vinyl, it weeded, transferred and stuck really well, pretty good value for the bundle and a nice assortment of colors. I just didn't like that many colors were substituted, which is mentioned in the listing details that colors maybe substituted according to availability. But it was still a bit disappointing for me especially for some of the blues, I kinda loved all the shades in this bundle. However, It is still a great value and product. And also very good customer service and prompt responses. They included a free eBook that has some very useful info about vinyl, great for beginners like me.
0,A little confusing at first simply because it is so different from the old style.  Getting to love this gauge!
0,Great for placement of design exactly where you want it when machine embroidering
0,Love this ruler; made cutting and measuring for quilting patches so much easier
0,These rolls work great for my scrapbooking! I had been using small tacky squares from another brand and it was laborious to peel them off the roll and stick onto my paper.  I am ordering these rolls from Amazon as they are cheaper priced than my local scrapbook store.
0,This was the bracelet that I ordered these for
0,I have never used this fabric.  The fabric is cute and would work for shoe bottoms from the baby age up to and including the elderly... would be good for sewing on bottom of house slippers
0,Makes the process of playing with your clay so easy and more enjoyable. Also makes the whole process quick.
0,I have been knitting forever and will only use Addi Turbos. Yes, they are pretty pricey but just buy them one pair at a time as you need them.	Someone in a knitting store in Santa Fe told me about them 8 years ago and I have been using no others ever since.
0,Great product and perfect for what I need.
0,I just started knitting and I think it works like it's supposed to but it's a little big on my finger
0,Excellent
0,Terrific light, thanks to whoever created it.  Would recommend it to anyone who sees on a machine.
0,Fast and love this product
0,you can't sew without a bobbin.  These were the right size and  work well.  It helps to have them already threaded.
0,Great value.
0,fast service, works great
0,This tool is important in separating intricate die cuts.  THANK  you !
0,Nice Beads.
0,I use these powders to make resin jewelry. The colors are very beautiful and you don't need much depending on your preference. The coolest colors are the interference ones. They look darmstadt good on black lipstick or eyeliner. They're non toxic so what the heck. I'm definitely going to buyou more of these.
0,What did I do without this?? I see all mu "stuff" at a glance.  More enjoyable working in my craft room. Thank you Totally Tiffany for this system, and Amazon for the price.
0,used it to seal the inside of a painted basket to hold bananas. perfect.
0,Awesome.
0,thanks
0,This is a great product. I recently made a makeup bag with batting. It just didn't stand up like it does using Soft and Stable.
0,Excellent form for pillow.
0,I purchased this brush for only one purpose--I needed a brush that would flick those nice splotches of paint I so adore in "messy" mixed media. This brush is fantastic for this purpose. And I do know there are certain shapes I can use the fanned-out bristles for, but one lesson at a time. This is what I needed now, and if you're looking for the perfect "paint flicking" brush--this one's it. I'm not an expert using it yet, so please don't judge the brush by the photo! :)		I've used it with both acrylic and water color paints.
0,So handy.  Get more than 1.  I store my needles in the little drawer.
0,Great for small projects
0,perfect for glass
0,Great buy of high quality needles.
0,My wife goes through these things like candy!
0,Works just as it should great quilling tool
0,It's like having 2 punches in 1 with the option of the solid punch, or die cut punch.  The price for it is really good too especially if you have Prime and get the free shipping.  I swear with Prime, I only buy produce at the store anymore!  Back to the punch, it is easy to use requiring the same amount of torque as any punch this size, and the butterflies are a versatile size that they can be easily used on cards or in albums.  And of course, it is a Martha Stewart product, so it has Martha Stewart quality.
0,Wow! How did I ever live without this tool??  Great machine that is easy to use and comes with the software needed to create basic designs. You have to upgrade the software if you want to get into more design stuff or import outside files (I was disappointed by that.). Other wise happy.
0,These are great for small projects. I carry the ruffle scarves that I am working on at the time and they just hold them perfectly.
0,So nice to use, hypo-allergenic is what my customers ask for.
0,Great Deal
0,Would NOT be without this. You can perforate a page a tear it out. That is so important to me as someone who creates journals both art and written. This tool is amazing. If you have ever wanted to neatly delete a page from a journal, book or diary, etc, you need this!
0,i love
0,Great hoop, holds pretty tightly than the regular hoops.
0,High quality cardstock
0,Product was as stated
0,easy to assemble and works perfectly
0,Nice paper for pastels, I just wish there was more.
0,love project life
0,Great for beginners! Love the scents, they burn very fragrant as well.
0,Worked great on my pleather couch. Very pleased!!!
0,Very clever idea.  Makes it much easier to turn up hems without burning fingers.  I only wish it had 1/4" gradations in addition to the 1/2" grids it does have.  Still, it's good for pressing the hem into place prior to stitching.
0,Every color you could ever want! I LOVE this set. I paint with these paints constantly. Great quality, awesome color selection. Great starter set!
0,Love these Pan Pastels!  A great selection and love the way they blend and mix.
0,great product
0,I have enjoyed these watercolor paints very much! Easy to use and mix. I love them and would use them again.
0,great, fast shipping
0,I was a little skeptical about these at first.  They have a sandpaper texture. I was afraid that it would "grip" too much because of the dense grit.  I have been pleasantly surprised though.  I have them on all of my quilting rulers now and will more than likely order more. You definitely can't just slide your ruler on your material or it will shift. After all, that's what they're made more.
0,This thing is pretty heavy, that's for sure. But, it cuts well and makes for a nice pendant  or keychain.  I was actually impressed with how well it cut through the yarn. I brought it with me on a bus. Do keep in mind, these are supposedly not allowed on airplanes.
0,Came faster than said and in a nice secure package. These markers are great and the multi-liner pen is really fancy. Thank you so much i plan to spend alot more money on your products.
0,No broken pieces, just beautiful, cut shells to sew on costumes.
0,I love getting these pkgs. they are so interesting and I adore the variety. the quality is good
0,Love the product !!! I am happy with all the items I got
0,Good product. Definitely imitation, but a good quality none the less. True to description as well.
0,Love this stuff.
0,easy to work with
0,Beautiful!
0,Happy with this product
0,The paintbrushes are plenty and cheap but they shed a lot at first but that mostly evens out after a few uses.  The bristles are also pretty uneven but that's not all bad for natural texture effects and in the end is great for a more natural and looser effect.  Decided to buy a second set since they are so cheap and I have ended up using them a lot.
0,Great for the price.
0,Great
0,Good
0,Perfect for those wine glass candle holders everyone is making this season! It covers six to seven glasses (be sure to use two or more THIN coats) and is worth the effort to order!
0,I own a whole set of these Susan Bates hooks.  I find them the perfect weight.  They glide through my work, no snags.  I don't have any problems with them.
0,Had an off putting odor but it's gone now. Makes a beautiful bar of soap.
0,My faux leather fabric rolls through just wonderfully. It was getting stuck with the regular foot even if I put scotch tape underneath.
0,Great packing, great product, so easy and fun to use, love all the color palette...if you are into arts and crafts is a must! You will want the whole collection!
0,Fun
0,Basic Darice embossing folder can be used on many different crafts, always good. I use it on my Cuttlebug.
0,Great pack of needles for the cost. Has a wonderful variety and a good length on the connector. Very easy to use! Also the needles are labeled with their sizes which is nice.
0,Great for my sewing
0,Best idea for airbrush palette I have ever seen or used. i bought extra bottles for thinners, mediums and water. Also have poured paint and inks into them to use with this palette. ArtBin make a satchel to carry two of these in. If you use an airbrush, check these out.
0,fantastic
0,Great yarn for socks!

0,Once you get them going they work great.  so many plans and will order again when it is time
0,This bag arrives flat and is made so it pops up to form a storage bag; voila! The bag seems sturdy and won't cave in. It looks like denim on the outside and the inside is blue and white polka dots. It's very well made and the stitching all looks good. You can carry it by the attached handle or clip on the adjustable shoulder strap. The top zips together with a zipper on both sides so you don't have to use one zipper to go all the way around. The inside has no pockets (wish it had at least one large one), but is roomy enough for quite a few skeins of yarn. There is a large pocket on the outside along with a few smaller ones where you could put crochet hooks or needles. The top has 2 slits for yarn to pass through without getting all tangled up (I'm really good at getting yarn tangled; ugh), and you could feasibly put 4 different colors through the slots (each slot has a hole on each end) if you're doing a project with different colored yarns.		This will now be my go-to bag for my knitting/crocheting group. Right now I have 3 large skeins of yarn inside the bag along with my current crochet project. In the outside pockets I have some crochet hooks and accessories. I'm really liking this bag and I'm sure any knitter/crocheter would. My only suggestion might be to put in a few more pockets; I can never have enough of them.  :-)		Product provided for my honest review.
0,Awesome mix of stamped metal charms; great fun using these in my jewelry making and best of all customers enjoy buying the finished products!  Definitely worth the money.
0,Makes beautiful diecuts.  Great for cardmaking.
0,Good performance for my project.
0,Great sample kit! A good selection of colors. The bottles are small (about 1/2 oz. each), but a little paint seems to go pretty far. Love the honeycomb effect of these paints. Some reviewers say that these paints have a strong odor.  I am very sensitive to chemical odors/perfumes and such, but these paints didn't bother me.  There is a slight odor, but not as strong as spray paint.  I used them indoors and haven't had a problem. What little smell there is disappeared once the paint dried.		The price is somewhat expensive in my opinion, but considering the paints are a product of France and have to be imported into the US, I guess the expense is justified. I have discovered that larger bottles of these paints can cost as much as $10.00 for a 1.5 oz, bottle, so this Discovery kit allowed me to try each color before purchasing a product that I would ultimately not like.		I would recommend this kit to others. It is a good way to sample the colors before investing in larger bottles of pigment.
0,I am thrilled with this machine.  I looked at the more expensive machines & just couldn't justify the $$$$$ for a beginner embroidery machinist.  I have done hand embroidery for for years.  The singer futura is wonderful .  Easy to use, has hoops up to 10 x6, and makes beautiful designs.
0,i love the color, the paint is a bit thin but this blue is perfect and the shine is amazing.
0,Great product.  Used to make totes.	Does become hot but cools very quick.		Recommends product to other people.		Very durable.
0,Excellent condition! And quality! I love singer accessories! Is made for make us life easier
0,i love them
0,This really works! In making clothes for my Grand daughter I am making a lot of small hems. Always frustrating when pressing and burning your fingers. So I got this and experimented using it on half the hem. When I pressed the folding pen side I had a sharp crease and the other half needed to be pinned before sewing. A great time saver and more accurate job.
0,Use this to make Dryer Balls.  Worked Great
0,The color is perfect arrived fast,  and have already dyed my clothing.  PERFECT
0,This strange looking gadget is a very clever invention.  Just looking at it, you wouldn't think it would work very well, but my daughter LOVES hers.  She says it saves her so much time and works very smoothly.  She would never give it up!  I got her this plus the Lacis Yarn Ball Winder MO17, and together they take a fraction of the time to wind hanks of yard into balls so she can start her projects much sooner.
0,I made a rather large baby blanket from this yarn, primarily because I could not find the shade of lavender I was looking for in any brand I normally prefer.  Red Heart's Soft is not as soft as some other, more expensive yarns, but it is very good, and I am happy with the results.
0,I use these magnetic sheets for holding my metal dies. They work great.
0,This thing is AWESOME
0,As a high school art teacher and practicing artist, I highly recommend Prismas to, well, everyone! My students and I both love the results we can get using these markers, especially when combined with the Prismacolor Premier colored pencils! I personally love not only the bright vivid colors in a seemingly endless amount of colors, but also that the Prismacolor markers allow the flexibility of having two distinct line widths in one marker. Very convenient! If you've never tried them out, I highly recommend getting this started 12 pack to play around with. When you realize how much you love them (and I'm sure you will!), you can slowly start adding colors to your collection.		(Also, you WILL want to order a colorless blender to go along with these!)
0,Just fun and bright
0,They are perfect to hold dies with matching stamps!
0,gets the job done if you need to tie a monkey fist.
0,This series has a fine selection of colors, and each jar goes a long way as long as you retain the excess power.  Good quality.
0,these work BETTER then your Crocheting and Knitting markers, these will stay in place no matter what you do with the project, also they don't catch on yarn from project.
0,This is the beat turner. I also use it to pull my serger ends. Love!
0,solid built
0,Super cute and awesome that it comes in it's own box!
0,using for wine glass charms
0,What a fun pair of scissors! And so sharp!
0,The earrings are very pretty, simple and easy to work with.  I like them very much.  Used them up in my jewelry  making.
0,I have never had any problems with yarn purchase from here. Picture is a V - Stitch Scarf
0,Works very well and easy to use, but on the expensive side.
0,It works well with my watercolor endeavors
0,Super product and nicely done.  Allows me to embroider endlessly.
0,I love my new cricut  2 Electric Cutting machine.  I am learning a lot as I go along.  Great. Love it. .
0,Nice design and perfect for using a variety of colors. High recommend !
0,Nice mix of colors and a great sized button for use in many projects. There also, was a mix of designs on them too.
0,Great darning needle kit to fit every projects' needs. The carrying case will hopefully prevent lost needles. Good price for a knitting necessity.
0,Product was good but when I received it 5 of them was broke and unusable. I want to order some zig kuretake watercolor paints but am afraid that will happen to them to  some feedback would be appreciated
0,This rotary cutter was supplied free of charge for reviewing purposes.  With that being said, it's a good quality overall rotary cutter. This cutter uses 45mm replaceable blades.  I have used it to open a variety of packages, it was safer to use this cutter than it was to use the scissors as a knife as I've frequently done in the past.  I also used it to trim photos on a cutting mat, always great results.  It would be wise to plan ahead and order a set of replacement blades to keep available, a dull blade would render this or any similar cutter less safe.  The blade IS indeed held on with a plastic nut.  It is easy to loosen to replace the blade.  It MAY come loose in heavy or frequent cutting applications, simply tighten the nut again which is easy enough to do.  I am a STRONG critic of unsafe products especially tools but I was not able to repeat the situation of the nut falling off on it's own despite using this cutter for several weeks.  In a heavy fabric situation it may indeed work loose but I wasn't able to repeat that situation myself. I LOVE the simple plastic locking mechanism which locks the blade either in the storage or the cutting position. Or just leave it unlocked and use the single trigger to engage the blade.  I'm right-handed, my husband is left-handed, we were both able to use this same cutter which is not always the case.  5 stars, I will update if I come across anything concerning in the use of this tool.
0,as described
0,Cuts very clean and nicely. comfortable to use.
0,Love it. Use it all the time. Arrived in a timely manner.
0,Great price for the amount. Canvas are decent. The paint takes extra paint to cover but it helps it you spritz the canvas with water and the paint application is way better.
0,Just what I needed for my new stamps :)  Good delivery time as well!
0,Lovely patterns, nice variety. Will make very nice projects.
0,I had no problem getting the scissors off the cardboard backing....there was no plastic, I just had to cut the band that was holding each one.	Like the other reviewers stated, it is nice to have a pair of scissors handy, without hunting for them.	I use the little ones for my crochet projects.  I found that they can be used with either hand, which is great.
0,I have 6 of these, each holding 2 12x12 scrapbooks. They make storage quite easy and are attractive enough to leave out on open shelves. The label holder in the front is a little tricky to use as the tag can fall out the bottom if it isn't thick enough card stock. Note: some 12x12 scrapbooks are about 1/4" too wide to fit the boxes but the majority of the ones I had did fit.
0,A little messy but so much fun. I just have my girls use it outside. The stickers adhere well too. My daughter made me a sticker a few days after christmas and I put it on my computer monitor. It's now may and it is still stuck on there ;)
0,Admittedly, I am not an artist, so this is a generic review as opposed to an expert review.  I like these a lot, purchased them for my grandchildren and use them myself often.		I got them from Michael's (craft store), and while standing in the aisle, looked up reviews of the different watercolor crayon products offered.  Some of them had terrible reviews, but these had a really good review (probably on the Amazon.com website).  So I chose these.		All I can verify is that they work, and the way I actually prefer to use them is to dip the end of the crayon in water and then color/paint with it.  It is easier than first coloring and then applying water with a wet paintbrush, or first painting the paper with a wet paintbrush and then coloring on the wet paper.  Little kids cannot easily control the amount of water in their paintbrush, so water can pool on the paper and you can still have a mess, but if the tip is dipped in water, it just softens the paint and doesn't make a watery mess on the paper.		Now I want a larger set.  Watercolor pencils are nice, too.  They work better for coloring more intricate patterns.
0,Stuff really does work! King of hard to be backing off but	sticks like crazy to just about any fabric. I'm Happy!
0,Cleaver idea, wish I thought of it. Works great and came quickly and packaged well.
0,enjoying making the items.
0,Great paint.  We use it on little plastic figures for D&D and other game playing figures.  Never chips and always easy to go on.  It is perfect as the base for the figurines and then any oil paint color on top of it.  Exactly what we needed.
0,I love my Chiaogoo circular knitting needles.  The bamboo is very smooth so my stitches slide easily but is not so slippery that my work is in danger of falling off the needle.  The slightly blunt point is just right for my style of knitting with textured yarns, such as boucles and fuzzy or brushed yarns.
0,Love the Sizzix line of Die sets.
0,Love Hero Arts.  Great ink for acrylic stamps.
0,These are the best needles for sewing on crochet project !!  I use them all the time I like to have several on hand so they are ready & threaded for my project.
0,I was looking for thin plexi/acrylic sheets but unsure of what to buy from the products listed/offered.		I took a chance on this and it is perfect for my needs. Very thin, lightweight,easy to cut with scissor.
0,Having previously filled an entire medium sketchbook as part of a year long "draw every day" project with everything from pencils & ink to Prismacolor & Gel Pens to gouache & watercolor, I can say that - without a doubt - the Leda sketchbook is the most durable, versatile, high quality book I've ever used.  The large seems to have all the same qualities.  Durable, moisture resistant, semi-soft cover (that gives you a good base anywhere), high quality paper (not super friendly with all erasers...but that could be my heavy hand), great spine, durable closure and unmatched customer care.  I love their story and their product, so I'm pretty sure that I've found my "go to" sketchbooks for life.  Thanks Mother Goddess!
0,great buy!
0,I use this for my smaller spot projects when I just want to embroider a name.  It irons on easily, stays in place and is easy to remove after you are done embroidering.
0,it's only 236 yds and the other's are 364 yds. OK! I'll look for the 364 yds next time. Still a great price. Dark Orchud is a beautiful color. I had to wear a mask to crochet the first skein. It's so linty. Where is all this lint coming from?
0,All good, & it was early.
0,L:ove it.
0,Beautiful just wish that I would have known how many were in each bag so I would have gotten more if I knew about it when I ordered them so I guess I will just have to save up some money $ to get more
0,very good
0,Great color. I guess paying more doesn't mean quality.
0,The pencils are pretty good quality and I'm surprised what you get for the price. I bought this on a whim and am very glad I did.  the pencils aren't the best quality but they are pretty good and unless you're a professional you won't know the difference.  The case is ok, not the best but its not bad either.  Its cloth so I don't predict it to last too long but all in all I'm happy I bought this.
0,This stuff is great! I use it to coat and seal my completed acrylic paintings on canvas. I mix it in water until it's dissolved. Then I apply 2-4 thin coats with a wide fine-bristle brush to achieve a beautiful streak-free finish. The more coats you apply, the more gloss you get. It's a wonderful way to finish and protect your works of art. Enjoy!
0,I like the ease of use.  Product was received in the recorded time and the  package was appropriate for the stated product.  This product serves it purpose.
0,When I want to try a new craft, I buy a kit...this one was so easy to do.  I have often thought it would be fun so ordered this beginner kit and within one hour of receiving it, I had a butterfly.  Amazing little kit.  It will make many, many more items and all are very easy to do.
0,Didn't know I needed this until I started using it.  Works great to help clear bits of paper when cutting dies.  The stamping side is super for getting good clean images.  Good item to have in you craft room.
0,Super happy with this..	Wwill purchase more of these soon
0,LOVELY SAMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL COLORS
0,excellent product...help you saving time.
0,These have saved me from so many pin spills, which is really important if you have cats and dogs underfoot all the time.
0,works pretty good
0,Exactly what I was looking for for paper mach & paste papers! Was hard to find locally! Craft & hardwsre store hadn't head of it, evwn though they carry Elmer's products!
0,Like all the reviews before me, for a pencil this smooth and easy to blend with water, it's worth paying high dollar for it. I just wish there was another set between the $300 and this one, perhaps something around the $60 to $80 range.
0,Not quite as dark as pictured (which is good, I was afraid they'd look black)--a very deep, rich, crimson red. Perfect little blood drops for some creepy halloween jewelry!
0,Works great! Buy them, they are a great deal!!!
0,Excellent product.
0,works as expected
0,Small enough for a pants or shirt pocket and pretty well made.	Dont know about the warning as the cover does not bleed and t seems fine.  Maybe the dye used to color the cover is deemed dangerous in high doses for pregnant woman but all others would find this an advantageous little note book whether artist or journalist.	I bought several for Christmas and Chanuka gifts and everyone was delighted with them
0,very high quality tools.  solid metal.  some of the handles are wrapped in tape which can be removed if you choose, but it makes the tools nicer to handle. would recommend these.
0,I like the design a lot
0,Very happy, it is a stronger 2 sided tape!
0,The stencils are wonderful!!!
0,I am so very pleased with the Envelope Punch Board by We R Memory Keepers.  It has really made making envelopes so easy.  It is well made, very light  weight and the quality is excellent.  Most of the time, I make A2 size cards and now I have paper pre-cut so I need only to punch and score to get an envelope made up quickly.  I make a lot of greeting cards and envelopes, and because I like to line my envelopes to match my cards, this punch board is really a time saver.  We R Memory Keepers could not have made it any easier to make up many different size envelopes.  Thank you for a really great product.
0,Nice
0,These tumbles are awesome. They fit well and are very comfortable. I often forget I have them one. The pink fits my middle finger and yellow fits my ring finger. I bought two different sizes because I was unsure of how they would fit. I will definitely buy them again.
0,I use everyday
0,These were perfect for a fall wedding scattered around the table decorations but boy did they smell bad! lol
0,Have used Quikwood for a long time and have heard a lot about this item.  Enjoyed the first time using it.  Will definitely order it again.

0,Nice selection,makes a nice bracelet ,I would recommend them
0,The girls in my quilting class would be lost without this needle threader and they are all planning on buying their own.
0,Absolutely wonderful! My order was processed and arrived quickly in less than a week. I got a great selection of gems with an excellent variety of sizes. This will be perfect for my jewelry making hobby! My husband was so pleased with my order that he immediately went online and purchased gems for himself from Verzazio! For the price I paid, I am more than extremely pleased with the gemstones I received!
0,I purchased this item to cut stencils out a bit more easily. I gave it four stars only because the handle tends to get quite hot while using it. Otherwise, it works well and does a decent job.
0,i purchased this on my husbands prime account, so it is a verified purchase even though it might not say it is.	being a professional face painter, snazaroo face paints get a lot of flack for not being one of the better brands. but $13 for this kit is a KILLER deal! i like to cut my sponges in half, and then cut them in half again. this makes them the perfect size for childrens faces, especially butterflies. so if you cut your sponges in half you have 4 sponges; if you cut them in half again, you have 8 sponges! i also tried cutting my sponges into a petal sponge (see picture) because these make really fast beautiful butterflies.	the handle on the brushes is REALLY short, like 4 inches. i would prefer a tiny bit longer handle, but the bristles on the brushes are excellent. as soon as this came in the mail today i pulled it out and my daughter asked if i would paint a 'red' cat on her. i mixed a little bit of white on a sponge and then rubbed the sponge onto the red, because i've heard that the snazaroo red stains. well after being hit in the face with a snowball and crying (blowing on her face so it would dry without ruining her face paint), about 4 hours later she took a baby wipe and it came off without a stain.	i really wish that this kit had orange so that i could do a tiger, but other than that i have nothing to complain about.	i am in love with the "toolbox" it comes with, it is the perfect size to store all my paints. the lid comes all the way (see picture) off which i like because then it's not in the way and it won't fall shut on you. the handle on the lid can be pulled up to make it stay up, or can be pushed down to be flat while in storage, great design! i have my mehron paradise palette on the bottom, water wipes on top of that, the snazaroo paints to the side of the baby wipes, hand sanitizer, glitters, spray bottle, split cakes, glitter gel that is included in this kit, and hair clips in the toolbox and i still have at least three inches of space! it's exactly what i wanted and needed!	the booklet has a really cute bandana design that i had never seen before and i'm excited to make it! it really is so cute (see picture).	as soon as i try the other colors i just might move this up to a 5 rating. even after the snowball to the face, crying, air drying, playing out in the snow, and at least 4 hours later the paint looked great, it came off easy and didn't leave a stain on the skin.	i really am so excited to try the other colors.		i made split cakes with the snazaroo colors and painted this tiger with the split cake. it blended beautifully!
0,This mold has a beautiful design.  I made solid lotion bars in this, and they released very easily.
0,Exactly what I needed
0,I haven't used this product yet.  I've just started thinking about doing this	but it's really too soon to tell.
0,This is a gorgeous eye catching bag, and a huge improvement on my previous plastic case. It is huge, and fits my machine, pedal, fabric and more in there with room to spare. I'm a beginner when it comes to sewing, but carrying around my machine in this bag makes me feel like a professional. While I haven't traveled with it yet, I find it has held up without a scratch being toted around the house - up and down the stairs as well.
0,I have owned the Brother 1034D serger for several years and this is identical. The only difference is the color scheme and that this comes with 2 extra presser feet and some extra thread. Amazon even uses the 1034D pictures in this ones listing. This, like the 1034D is the best serger on the market at this price point. They are also of very high quality. My 1034D has been dropped off of a collapsing table and still worked. They are tough machines. If you're buying a serger, I assume you are somewhat experienced at sewing. I consider myself a little experienced at this point, but still can't figure out how to thread this thing from start to finish even with watching the videos. So, ALWAYS tie it off like the video recommends and just change your thread like that. I wouldn't try to thread it yourself from the start unless you're sure you know how. If you're considering this machine look at the 1034D as well, as it is currently cheaper on Amazon, but doesn't come with the extra 2 presser feet. I only use the standard one myself, so the 1034D would be all I need, but you may need the others. Either way, you're getting a high quality serger at a really low price, so you can't go wrong.
0,These pencils dissolve really well. They are a bit paler with water than Caran d'Ache Supracolour -  the pigment isn't as strong. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the colours are still really pretty when muted but it is a matter of preference. The colour range is really great - a wide variety of colours with a nice group of blues. The tin could be a bit better as it is easily bent near the hinge. This set is excellent for the price.
0,This was a bargain for how many sheets I got for the price. I also received it very quickly so I was able to use it right away like I had never run out. This is a great substitution for storing unmounted stamps on rather than pay a fortune for one sheet that is one quarter the size. So I am able to store all of my stamps in half the space for one quarter the money. Again, what a bargain and if I run out I will go straight to this vendor for more of this product. Get it while you can before someone figures out a way the charge more for this. Love this product, plus it is great for handmade window cards and whatever crafts that require clear plastic!
0,These were an unexpected surprise. They are never far from my side when I'm in my craft room. Now I want to purchase one for each room in my apt.
0,These are great snaps!  I'm a first time user of the KAM snaps and I was surprised at how easy they are to put on your project. Nice starting out with a selection of colors.
0,Love them.
0,Everybody loves this yarn! I have used a lot of it and I love it. It's even nicer after you wash it...real soft. I made a kids' "Snake" scarf with big shiny eyes...nothing scary about him! It was about 290 rows of stockinette stitch with a 'collar' of red.
0,Works great
0,This palette feels heft and well made. I like how many sections it has.
0,Love this scissors. It's great to cute all your paper crafts with precision, and I'm guessing you could also cut fabric with it. It's smooth and you can lock it. I'm glad I purchased this.
0,This spool of black Coats and Clark thread has CHANGED MY LIFE! I used to be so depressed about the cheap quality of my last spool of black thread, how quickly it would snap and how it would unravel in my machine. Thoughts of my ruined sewing haunted my dreams and kept me in a constant state of melancholy round the clock. Couldn't focus at work, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep... but then! I came across Coats and Clark and I am saved! My life has meaning and purpose once more, the sky is blue and the sun is shining... with this cheap but high-quality thread, I can go on. Thank you, Coats and Clark. THANK you.
0,Great price..great sellers!!! Recommend highly!!!
0,Good product.  Nice heavy weight.  I'm using tge sheets as dividers for my assorted cardstock that I use in card making.  Working very well.
0,really useful
0,Good product and a reasonable price.
0,These clips are so convenient to use.  They hold their position and don't get in the way and are easy to remove.
0,GOOD
0,Mask is very thin and easy to apply.  A light rub with finger gives good texture
0,Worked perfectly in my ink jet printer for the job that I needed a transparency for.
0,I do not mind them.  Average
0,Great item
0,Well designed with the spindle size and shape.  Superior to units with turning disc and stationary spindle.  Turns easily and feeds smoothly.  It could be improved with a wire loop guide to pull the yarn thru.
0,Work great for my oil painting.
0,Wonderful better than I thought
0,Love all these letters, I bought them to sit on my mantel to spell 'home'
0,This is awesome, love it making Christmas cards with it
0,works well to sew over jeans hump
0,Never had navy blue before, so glad to find this. StazOn inks by Tsukineko work beautifully. My dad said always by the best supplies so you can do your work easily and these stamp pads are confirmation of that.
0,These are a nice collection of tag shapes and are handy for a lot of projects where there is a need for a specific size or type of paper needed. I especially love the little ones. Not sure why but I think they are cute.
0,I love Spellbinders dies!!! This is the perfect addition to my vast collection!!
0,I'm used to a larger palette, so at first I thought this was too small.  It is only 6 3/4" in diameter.  But being small and light weight it is very comfortable to hold.  And it is perfectly suited for small work.		To hold it properly and stable, I did lose the use of two of the wells.  The wells are not deep:  Only about a 1/4" at its deepest point.  Each well is 1 5/16" in diameter.		*I received a sample product from Chameleon
0,I purchased this paint to use for sun printing. I have used it twice and it works very well.  I thin the paint with water.  I am please with The variety of paint colors in the set.
0,great
0,Consistent quality - cannot go wrong with ampersand  brand.
0,Can't say enough nice things about these pens.  All the colors worked and I try them all every time.  They came in a nice holding case.  I think this is my 3-4 order of these so you know I like them.  I do a lot of adult coloring.  Have any questions, please feel free to ask.  Will answer honestly.
0,I have 3 other packages of Zig products, the scroll & brush, the calligraphy, and the writers markers. I love them all and use them almost daily. When I saw this package, I just had to order it. They have another package on Amazon that has less markers in the package, but if you're a pen/marker/writing with awesome materials fanatic like I am, go big or go home. And by home I mean somewhere dark where you will never see or experience the sheer awesome of these markers. If you're expecting a ton of glitter, this is not for you.  From my perspective, the "fine glitter dust" that they write on the box is accurate. You get the color of the marker and it isn't completely overrun by glitter.
0,Great item fast delivery
0,Was exactly as described, came in a timely manner, and I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
0,Loved it
0,The right tools make a project making better.  Perfect for rag quilts.
0,This die cuts with very sharp edges and is a beautiful design.  It is easy to work with once you make a few.
0,Book has many great ideas.  pictures were good and colorful.  they require too many words for a review.  will probably never sew anything out of this book.
0,This is a nice set. It's well made and very solid. I especially like the desk top easel which is very adjustable and steady when locked in. Also has a great selection of paints and some nice little brushes. Exceptional product! Great for travel.
0,Great for embroidery projects my mom loved them the stencil went on them really well
0,I use this all the time when I'm making long cuts or I just don't want to deal with my mat and cutting down rolls. I love it. I have a bit of a hard time getting the machine and the roll feeder to line up together, but I think that's because I must not be coordinated enough for that (yet, can lay down vinyl, go figure). It works with both my Portrait and my Cameo with no issue. I've never had any problems with it feeding incorrectly. I'm short on space on my desk so this helps.
0,Nice product but needs extra spaces for crochet needles.
0,Vivid color and smooth texture.
0,I received this in one day!.  This product works beautifully, the pencils are set up for easy access.  The quality and price works for me.
0,a must have in every quilter's notions! I purchased several and keep one in my sewing room, one in my purse and one in my case which I carry my sewing machine in. I think I should put one in each of our cars...LOL		If you have trouble visualizing what colors will work, just flip over the tool and it will show you several options for each color in the pack...no more wondering about color theory, it's all very simplified for easy use...you'll want several!
0,muy bueno
0,This is the type of hoop I prefer to use and it is hard to find.
0,Love it
0,This is easy to use and worked just as expected!
0,I like these also, plan to make more necklaces, and replace all my broken ones using these clips. They are great looking and easy to use.
0,I have only used the molds once, so cannot address the long-term use of them. They arrived in a timely manner and were as described. They are soft, pliable silicone which made my soap easy to unmold. The pliability means that it is a good idea to use a solid surface to stand them on - I use a cookie sheet, which makes the filled molds easy to move once poured. The size was good. Felt comfortable in the hand. Given a wish, I would have liked the cavity to be a little deeper but that in no way is to be construed as dissatisfaction.
0,Love it!  I have tried other products and this one has at least 2 advantages. It comes with a tool to help you put them on at the correct distance from your needle and I also like that you can apply them and remove them over and over.  This is always a problem since they often cover the bobbin cover or stop you from opening the storage compartment. I am currently making a bargello quilt. I wish I had purchased them for the first step of sewing all the strips together.  I believe it is helping give me more uniform seams with less wobble. The grid plate that assists in proper placement has several different measurements- more that just the quilters 1/4"
0,Works great. It is so easy to handle with my big hands!!
0,Good buy
0,The small size is no bother at all when it comes to writing with!!!		And all tips are great!
0,Beautiful pattern and a light weight yarn that is just amazing in a scarf.  The Color blends with almost anything!
0,These are great! They aren't all different colors as much as they are the same colors in different finishes. Metallic, glitter, shiny, bright, neon, that kind of thing. There are fun ones thrown in that change colors as you write.
0,excellent pastel mat for painting..
0,They really make your jewelry pop.  Everyone who sees them in a piece fall in love with it.
0,Love this Stuff!! Have been making bows for my little girl and this is an easy way to keep the ends from raveling.  Works great!
0,Supplement to other color selections tools I have. Some things I create need better contrast. This will help
0,stitched rectangular dies very nice .
0,I was having trouble keeping my little Singer Featherweight sewing machine in place. Not only does this pad keep the machine where I want it, it also reduces any vibration noise. It's a perfect size for my larger portables, too.  I like the thickness--this is not a floppy piece of foam that is going to disintegrate. I highly recommend it.
0,What can I say about "glue" ?  It works!
0,Handy for designing jewelry.
0,Works great for any project. I'm using these mostly with beads, buttons, needles...
0,I made a huge batch of different charms for the jewelry I sell, and I had no problems with this at all. The "matte" look on some of my pieces is from the release agent I used in the mold, but I also made some without the agent and they came out glossy and great. I enjoy both looks, so I use both methods. Literally no complaints, would definitely buy again!
0,The best glue ever
0,Great Product !!, Great delivery !! (came before expected), and living up to the Lion Brand tradition.  Thank You A+ seller.
0,This thing has saved my wrists!  It makes making fleece blankets sooooooo much easier!  I just cut and stitch!  Love it!
0,One of my favorite cartridges!
0,GOOD
0,Nice quality wire, easy to work with, cuts easy with a scissor. great for crafts. Highly recommend
0,Great product - durable - handy for storage
0,This one stencil has several designs I use over and over in art journal projects and other hobbies. I recommend it!
0,I ordered a size too small for a project I wanted to do but it turned out great anyway. The beads are a mixed variety and the colors are soft. These are very pretty and can easily be used in stacked bracelets.
0,The numbers are wearing off of my KA bamboo interchangeable needle set.  I need to know which size is which.  I like that this gauge is long enough to peek up out of the pocket of my knitting bag so it's easy to locate. The needles I have tested fit the holes well, so I wasn't left wondering.
0,Could no longer find the Martha Stewart glue pens.  These are exactly like that brand was.  Good glue for Crafting.
0,Perfect tools for making coordinating flowers and embellishments for craft projects.
0,This price is good. The colors I received are very close to what is pictured.		I received orange, gray, peach, fuchsia, pale yellow, yellow, medium blue, teal, lime, aqua.		I already own a Recollections Washi Tape dispenser in pastels purchased from Michaels		Comparison:	Coromose tape (.7mm) is slightly wider than the Recollections (.65mm).	Each Coromose tape roll is 5m in length and Recollections is 10m in length	Coromose sent 10 rolls and Recollections has 8 rolls.	Coromose is sent in a plastic sleeve and Recollections tapes are contained on a single dispenser.	Coromose tapes are just under $4 and Recollections are just under $4 with a 50% off coupon.	Coromose arrived 15 days after I ordered much sooner than stated.		Since I will use these tapes with paper clips to make labeled book and magazine markers and labels to organize things, I really like the variety and the width.
0,I use a lot of this product and for purses and bags it's ideal for a light to med interfacing.
0,Easy to understand and use.
0,Used this pack to make valentines with my son. We used a lot of the Valentines colors and I'm sure we will be hitting up the other colors very soon.  Every preschooler needs a good pack of construction paper. :)
0,Easiest possible tool to make TONS of pompoms. I was recommended this by a friend, and I couldn't imagine going back to the old wrapping & cutting around a circle method... I LOVE this thing. And all the other pompom makers I ordered on here.  (I have one in every size, now.  I love it that much.)
0,Awesome patina to work with - highly recommended.
0,I love this yarn so much,  I'm currently working on a blanket and it nice and thick strong great in quality.	A must buy, I was hesitant but decided to buy it boy am I GLAD I did.
0,Great price, fast shipping
0,You MUST have this cartridge storage if you own a Cricut!!! It has space for many cartridges and your other Cricut items.	If you have even more cartridges than this will hold, just buy another, they are very affordable. They also look very nice on your craft table! High quality!!!
0,Great for card making.
0,Nice thread
0,Work great
0,Used for many projects and they still have color.  The tips messed up if you have enthusiastic children coloring to hard.  After letting it set for 24 hours, I have had no problems with the colors fading after many washings.
0,For the most part, worked great....had a little trouble with one area getting the flocking to adhere.
0,I like this brand of needles so I ordered and was very pleased with my product.
0,Great selection of photos.
0,Great needles!
0,You either like Bob Ross's laidback style or you don't. We do. His quiet enthusiasm inspires us to pick up some brushes and get painting. Or you can just relax and enjoy his painting techniques. He was truly suis generis--we won't see his like again, but we can enjoy his paintings and instructions via DVD.
0,The color the dust cover is perfect, exactly as shown on the website.  The quality of the material is simple/basic.  Will use to cover machine.
0,Very pretty bright and colorful ribbon. I wanted a small quantity in case I wasn't satisfied with my purchase. I will definitely purchase more. The price was good too. I highly recommend for purchase.
0,Great price for the combo
0,These work well for my daughter's beads.  Just what we were looking for.
0,Great price and a good product.
0,excellent quality of thread
0,Beautiful! these paints are so very nice to use.  Great coverage for gold colors.
0,My granddaughter loved these.
0,Cuts perfectly. Great product.
0,My girlfriend uses these a lot and they have held up very well!
0,Great selection
0,I have used Thangles before and was looking for something with less hassle.  This is easy to use for half triangles.  I like that i have a stitch line now as sometimes I am not very accurate with my 1/4" foot.
0,I purchased this set of dies and the Small Houses dies by Reiko Kato to create a gift. On the table runner there are all 4 houses each flanked by a tree. On each place mat is located one house and one tree. They are working up very well and will be as I envisioned when I ordered the GO! Trees dies and the GO! Small Houses dies. Thank you for your skill, Reiko Kato. I'm grateful to Amazon.com for their discounted prices.
0,So easy to work with and  such a great buy  good quality
0,super product for a super price, my grandson had a blast building his grade 3 bridge project.. great value.
0,Just right size
0,Nice organizer, bought these for my daughter who loves drawing. They help you to well organize your color pencil, so you can find the color easily.
0,Glue dots are my go-to adhesive.  Easy to use and holds great.
0,Arrived as stated. Have not used it as of yet. But hoping to in a few weeks.
0,This paint is so awesome. It doesn't take much light to make it start glowing. A little pricey for the amount of paint you get, but, it does glow & lasts like no other paint out there.
0,Great product,great price!!
0,I am not a scrapbooker so this product isn't going to be used 24/7. I got this product with the intention of making tags - there's an additional accessory - tagmaker - which will be my next purchase		Thoughts before I purchased this product: is it worth paying $$$$ for this? Will I get my return on investment?? Will I regret buying it? I did ALOT of research through online forums/customer ratings before making the ultimate decision that this was it.		Why did I choose Slice over Cricut? What I wanted was for a product that does tags - the slice comes with the shapes that I want. It's also wireless (some reviewers have complained that they can't use it for over an hour, but I don't plan on doing that, and I also don't mind using it plugged in). Significantly less than the Cricut. Slice cartridges are 1/2 the cost of Cricut. I don't intend on doing large projects. It only prints from 0.5" to  4"  (in 1/2" increments).		What I've done so far? I've made a few cut outs and tags - I still need to get the "tagmaker" which will make the metal rings around my tags - really excited for that. I just got an embosser so I have cut outs of 2" circles - emboss, and will use the tagmaker to attach the metal portion and BAM - instant glam.		Thoughts on the machine: Yes it's annoying to have to hold the machine steady during a cut - but it's not "physically demanding" and it's a fair tradeoff in getting some nice/snazzy tags for our gifts (especially with the holidays around the corner, and I don't have to manually cut each individual tag). The cuts are surprisingly fast - it takes a few blinks of an eye to cut out an intricate "love" or a letter. I have to get use to the cutting layout so I don't waste paper. Seems like once I have that figured out, I'll be getting maximum usage of the overpriced scrap booking stock paper. I like that is SMALL (it's about the size of my p-touch label maker) - which makes it portable and I can leave it on my desk without being annoyed with wasting valuable real estate.		Future: I can see many other projects evolving from this - making little "saying" banners (spell words out and connect them with yarn or metal rings) - intricate and more personalized gift tags - school projects for my kiddo. I also like making cards so this will be a great project to make our monogramed cards.		KEEP IN MIND:	Read instructions - the power button is small and in the back of the machine - you have to push a few buttons before the cut starts - you have to push the menu button to "home" the blade - there is also a "protocol" to selecting shapes, then selecting the size you want and then cutting it (I wanted/expected something like a single push)	DO NOT use the glass cutting mat without the "adhesive on it" - place a thin line (like the line of the grid on the mat) of glue from 1"-4" markers, and then use the sponge to spread it on the glass - it seems like that's the right amount without making it overly sticky - do let the glue dry - takes only a few minutes	Keep the bottom plastic packaging piece - it helps to have that be the home for the machine when not in use - I don't worry about the machine getting dusty	Get the tools if you want - really don't need it. You can get by with a nice pair of tweezers - I have the 15pc tool kit - I like the way it all looks and is contained in 1 package but it's not necessary - the accessories are inexpensive - I also got the embossing kit - really looking forward to that	I have read reviews that this product doesn't cut well - not sure I agree, I used some thick texture card stock and it was fine.		I have no regret on buying this product. I think I'm getting my money's worth. It's saving me time and keeping my tags looking uniform. I'm really excited about using this product in the future and creating some more personalized and unique items. Well worth the money.		UPDATE: Shortly after I got the SLICE, I went and got the Cricut Expression as well. I think the Cricut is way better!! (Read my other review). But if you have limited space and need something occassionaly - the Slice is great! The glass cutting board it uses is amazing (while the Cricut, the mats are expensive and you go through them easily). I did end up getting the tag maker and it's AMAZING! I've got an embosser with our name and address, and we make personalized tags to go with our gifts. Beautiful and classy.
0,I use the bin to store my board game components.  Some of the dividers were warped, forcing me to bend them back in place to lock in the inserts.  This flaw aside it's a sturdy, well constructed general-purpose bin.
0,This ruler is awesome, I cut a yard of fabric into 3" squares in less than 10 minutes. It is well worth the money. Once you get the hang of getting your rotary blade in the slot it saves so much time, work, and fabric.
0,Good, it does the job
0,good brushes
0,Love these hooks.
0,Measures accurately and looks great in photos
0,Just as pictured. These are great for crafting and price is right!
0,Oh I love this die!  I already have used it and it looks so pretty for card making.
0,Super sharp art grade scissors for crafts, card making, cutting card stock, kitchen use and more. Easy to clean. Easy to sterilize. Great grip handles, and a bargain. These are wonderful. I use them mainly for paper crafts.
0,I tried this cutter after using a friend's expensive (hundred dollar plus!) rotary cutter.  I'm new to quilting, so I couldn't justify that kind of investment.		I've had this cutter for a month now and I love it!  I don't notice any difference between it's performance and the much more expensive version my friend has.  Save the money and buy this!  Then you can buy more fabric!  :)
0,great time saver.
0,This has been a great help in my artwork.  I paint watercolors and everyone always wants a copy of the latest work.  This works so well I put a 140 lb cold press piece of watercolor art on it and copied onto another 140 lb paper, and it wasn't even on the highest setting.  I love it and can't wait to discover other ways to use it.  Perfect size for on my lap or on the art desk.
0,Nice and sharp for cutting zig zag edges to prevent fabric from fraying. Good grip on handle. Cute color.	Bear in mind, they're a bit large so may not be the best for fine detail cutting (I.e. if you need to cut very close to the edge of collars with interfacing etc.)
0,Great love the feel!
0,This is a great dressform! My only complaint about it is the breast size and how the chest sizes because of that. The actual "boobs" are much smaller than mine, and so it's a bit distorted for how things physically fit on me.		All in all though, if you're plus size and need an adjustable dress form, this one is great. I've had mine for several months now, and don't know how I ever lived without it.
0,Love these.
0,I know there are a lot of people out there that think spending this kind of money on colored pencils is just a waste of money and in all honestly, depending on just how serious you are about your artwork and the quality of your artwork....well, you may just be right. If you just want a cheap set of pencils to play around with, especially with adult coloring becoming so popular, you can buy a set of Crayola colored pencils for like $5-$10. That being said, if your really serious about your artwork and want the highest quality, make no mistake about it, spending this kind of money on colored pencils is worth every last cent. Many of the great techniques one can use with colored pencils isn't even possible with the cheaper pencils. Things like layering, blending, etc.		Personally, I started out using Prismacolor pencils as they are a good mid quality pencil and are much more affordable than your high end pencils like Faber Castell and Caran d'Ache. I went to art school for photography, but I also love to draw and have been doing so for most of my life, although I really didn't get serious about it until I went to art school. Pretty much everyone in the drawing department used Prismacolor pencils and copic markers so my first big set of colored pencils was naturally from Prismacolor. They are great pencils and I actually still use Prismacolor pencils from time to time even to this day, but as the years went on I got curious about other brands and started experimenting with higher quality brands like Faber Castell and Caran d"Ache and I am really thankful that my curiosity got me to do so as the difference in quality from the mid level pencils to the high level pencils is really something to behold. Yes, they are expensive, but once you start using them and you see first hand the difference in quality...well, chances are you will wind up buying more, not look back regretting the money you spent. Of all the different colored pencils I have tested, my single favorite is without question Caran d'Arch Luminance. I also really like Faber Castell Polychromos, but Caran d'Ache's Luminance line is the line I use when I want the absolute best possible quality. The pigments are just absolutely beautiful and they have the perfect smooth feel to them, not to hard and not too soft.		Honestly, even if your only into adult coloring, I would recommend at least testing a few of these pencils out. You can buy them individually from various art stores like Dick Blick so you don't have to spend a fortune to be able to buy a small set of primary type colors. I openely admit, even I have enjoyed some of the adult coloring books that have come to market. I am a big comic art fan and I really enjoyed the Marvel Civil War coloring book and DC's Batman Hush coloring book. And yes, I still used my higher end pencils even for those.		Bottom line - In my opinion, Caran d'Ache Luminance pencils are the best colored pencil's on the market and I have tested pretty much every brand I could get my hands on over the last 10 years. The pigment is stunning and they really do have just a perfect smooth feel to them. The lead is perfectly bonded to the wood all the way through the pencil, which is actually California Cedar, so you won't have pieces of your lead falling out like you can get with cheaper pencils. I highly recommend learning how to hand sharpen pencils if your going to use these. Electric sharpeners will just chew through them really fast. The only downside to these pencils is once you get used to the quality, its very hard going back to cheaper brands.		5 Stars!
0,Great quilting foot.  Easy to see what I'm quilting, foot has a restrained hop that gently holds the fabric and isn't distracting. Like this much better than the plastic ones.		My only complaint is that I have to use a needle threader to move threads under the foot once I've pulled up the bobbin thread (a very small thread opening in the foot would have been helpful).
0,works great...nice coverage for heat embossing on just about any paper
0,Wow is all I can say. This stuff is a miracle. I am amazed how I can fix a pocket my husband ripped on a pair of dress pants. To this day it still holds after washing and drying. 5 stars is what I give this product. It truly is amazing.
0,AOK
0,Pretty colors
0,This is needed to cut through vinyl.
0,Another great Sulky product I use this often.
0,Works nicely.
0,this is a bright color that adds deminsion to the other soft colors It  looks great  in a sp ring wreath
0,Only pins I buy since I discovered these. Long thin pins. Dont be rough on them or try to pin something thick. Wont work. These are dressmaker pins.
0,very good quality!!!!!
0,These bobbins are so much easier to use then winding yourself.  Exactly the right tension was set when they were wound and it worked perfectly when I worked used them on my project.  Good product and a great price.  Bonus-  I will have plenty of bobbins for regular sewing as these are used up on my embroidery projects.
0,The 'satin' is right in that sweet spot between original and glossy. To me, Mod Podge is the most versatile of the finishes, and the satin is the perfect one for most projects. Mod Podge is great, can be diluted easily and still works well for most projects.		To use it, you just put it on a brush and brush it onto whatever surface you like. I use it for paper machet, to waterproof a cardboard box, enclosing leaves and putting glitter on things without it coming off in large quantities.
0,I really like this Wonky die.  It accentuates my cards beautifully!
0,Lovely, detailed mold.  A fairy big seller when used for soaps.
0,Heavy weight cling vinyl.  I have purchase the Cricut brand of vinyl and found it to be very flimsy and expensive.  This brand is thick, sticks great to windows and cheaper then the name brands
0,Im using this to make a macrame dog leash, its very nice and sturdy rope.
0,wish they we bigger skeins but they're fine for small projects
0,Nice pack for my scrapbooking needs.  The paper is good quality and the colors are nice as well.
0,very sturdy, and well put together but also very light
0,I really like it... It's light, soft and the actual colours correspond to the computer image... The yarn is extra big in a very economical price..
0,These work perfectly for making dog harnesses.  :-)
0,I used them to decorate a cotton shirt with fabric paint.  Love them!
0,Shiny, doesn't break or shred, will buy again. The clear cover protects the thread during sewing, prevents tangles. Love it.
0,Thanks.
0,Best value for a kit like this. I had no problem using outdoor fabric with these buttons. I used a large D battery to press down each button.
0,great tool works very well, and its made well
0,This is better than I expected for it's planned use.  So glad I made this purchase!
0,Fun mix Using with youngster for learning colors, shapes, etc.
0,Love it, but takes some extra care to cut.
0,I am very happy with this craft sheet.  I use it everyday and am so pleased with the ease in which I can clean it off.
0,I tend to have a lot of things on my desk so I thought these would be good for when I am working in a smaller space(yes, instead of cleaning off my desk) LOL I am hoping also since these are smaller they will be easier for me to hold down. I got all of there rulers to see which would work best for me. Maybe I will finally get a perfect cut.
0,Makes clean easy cut on cardstock and heavier materials.
0,Smooth, vibrant colors, several shade gradations, esp. the blues and greens; very nice wooden box with "stays" for each side full of pencils
0,Great and useful
0,I'm sure this will yield many quilts
0,The extra shine adds such a fun twist to my jewelry.  I bought spacers and findings to compliment these.  Looking forward to Spring flings!
0,Don't know how you rate this.  It's yarn.  I use this brand when I can because of the quality and the price.
0,This stuff is super cool! Make sure to put enough coats on AND let them dry in between application, and a FULL 24 hours before painting. Light sanding helps with the texture. Make sure to seal your work after too!
0,exactly as described, works well with styrofoam covered felt to display pendants or whatever.  holds pretty heavy items and would look okay to use two pins if needed
0,The quilt is nice but I am still trying to figure it out on putting it together.  I am new at this.  You shipped it right away and I do thank you for that.
0,Great colors, easy package to chose from.
0,Good for holiday cards, many ideas.
0,Nice product. Good replacement and value.
0,This is the best Rotary Cutter I've ever owned. I've had absolutely NO problems with it at all. I would buy it again.
0,Really works to remove adhesive tape, without tearing your cardstock
0,Great!!
0,I used this thread to make new covers for my 3 season porch patio set. It was easy to sew in my brother sewing machine (although I had read in reviews it did not sew well)	Use a big stitch and a (5) in your tension.
0,I LOVE this tape!! Holds well! Works great on cards!
0,I love these things. The cable straightens out well enough to work with easily. The ends and tips screw together well, and you get plenty of little tightener keys in case one bends. You just have to be careful with them, that's all.	The wooden tips are nice and smooth, and the transitions between the metal ends and the wooden tips are also smooth and will not snag your work.	I love working with these needles. I'm so glad I bought the set! They're beautiful, too.	(Dreamz Deluxe Interchangeable Long Tip Knitting Needle Set)
0,my neice loved it she does jewlery so i thought it would good for her. will have to check back for other types.
0,Met all my expectations!
0,Product worked as described, and was on time.
0,Been sewing over 40 years but lately my eyes aren't what they used to be.  The magnetic seam guide affords perfect topstitching and seaming every time.  You can't mess up.  Just position on your machine's metal plate, and run your fabric along the edge.  Perfect every time.  Some people warn not to use on a computerized machine, but I use it on mine.  Just make sure not to let it remain on your machine when not in use. Best $5 I ever spent.
0,I love this yarn--have used it many times
0,Good grade fabric and nice patterns
0,Beautiful beads, tho I only had 8 purple beads! Out of 200 and only a couple colors I thought it'd be a little more balanced than that. I love them tho, I use them for headbands for newborns and accent pieces on props.
0,LOVE these!! I have animals and I have to grind small amounts of medicine to give daily and all other containers were too big
0,I use these for macrame keychains.  Nice quality.
0,Beads are great and just as described and expected.
0,Love this fabric stabilizer. Shipping was as indicated. Happy with the product.
0,Machine works, but bulb was broken when I opened the package.
0,This has to be the best purchase I have made!  Love the ease of installing these snaps.  Can't believe I wait this long.
0,I'm new at adding appliques to quilt tops, but this product is very user-friendly.
0,nice but shipped from China...took a while
0,Very Good.
0,Great colors to do many art projects. Bottles are big and awesome price
0,Great product.
0,My girlfriend uses this, so here's her review:		"This clay is wonderful. I've used it thus far to make tiny food and shapes, although I will say that I haven't baked it yet, so I can't speak to that end.		I am a beginner with polymer clay, so I was looking for something of the softer variety that had a lot of colors for me to play around with. It takes very little kneading to get this clay into a workable condition. I've found that even though there's only a small amount of each color in the pack, I've used very little of it after three projects! Of course, I am making very small things with this clay, but still... a little seems to go a long way. Just last night I tried mixing red and white to make a pink, and it was much easier than I expected and produced a very pretty pink color. Highly recommended, especially for beginners."
0,Love the Cricut brand adhesive mats! They truly are the best I have found to work with. They last longer and firmly hold the paper in place without tearing it.
0,great tool to have
0,purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!
0,good stuff
0,Very Nice, Thank You.
0,As I mentioned in another review, I wasn't sure at first that these layering punches would be all that great. I have found, however, that I use them often in my crafting. The opening is even wide enough to fit thin foam or cork sheets, making for cute little embellishments. I'm having tons o' fun with my Martha Stewart punches!
0,I love this product. I'm new to scrapbooking and this is so much better than gluing things to the paper. Glue was messy - I tried sticks and liquid glue. This works like magic though. I space out the places where I use the runner, and that helps prolong its life a little. I use photo squares for mounting photos, and use this for bonding pieces of a page together. What's nice is that you can safely remove most items from a page, if you so wish. I was able to take some items from one page and re-mount them on a totally different piece of paper without any issues. Basically, it stays stuck unless you *want* it to unstick.
0,Great product. Thanks!!!
0,The mandrel is good.  The plastic sizers are not.  Get better quality metal sizers if you need some.
0,These are Christmas gifts for my granddaughters who love to draw and work with various art types.  An excellent buy!
0,I LOVE this mat.  I wish I ordered a larger one.  I do ALL of my cuttings on it.
0,These are really nice but smell terrible. I love the shimmer and pearl effect they give but man do they smell when I use them! Still a great product if you light a candle haha
0,Some of the very tiny molds will work with polymer clay, but others will break easily with no effort at all.  They would be okay for scrapbooking, maybe, but for jewelry, only some will work.  As an example, some of the molds are less than 1/4".  The rope molds are my absolute favorite.
0,Awesome product for the bohemian/hippie look. These beads are sturdy and can be easily threaded with hemp. I would definitely recommend this company!
0,when I got this, one or two of the hairs were sticking out and messing up my inking. I clipped the hairs and now the brush works like a charm. A great size for comic artists, its line varies from super-thin to nice and chunky.
0,I gave as a gift.
0,I used this to hang plastic sharks and dolphins in my son's habitat science project. The string is stretchy and easy to work with. We have tons left so I plan to keep it in case we ever need it again for something similar.
0,I love this ruler it has everything on it. takes a lot of work out of sewing and measuring.
0,This is really a useful product in so many ways. They have a  Very strong Self adhesive so you don't have to worry about that. Stays where you place it very well.  However, it can also be removed easily. These are perfect to have in the house for so many projects. Every household should have these, you will be amazed at how much you use them.  Nice product, great price received for a honest review.
0,worked well for my project, sturdy enough for the key chain.
0,I hate, hate, hate "fussy cutting" or any cutting.  I am slow so it takes me forever.  Finally a company that started making dies to match there new stamp line!!!  Plus Sizzix and Tim Holtz our both great companies!
0,Perfect.
0,This stuff is pretty much awesome. So multi-functional!
0,great yarn for crafting! Even color throughout.
0,I really like this threader
0,Great Product Fast Shipping
0,Fine stencils.
0,Vintaj Patinas are opaque inks that have been specially formulated to adhere to metal.  They create colorful "patina" finishes on metal jewelry pieces such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vintaj/dp/B001V73H7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vintaj</a>&nbsp;as well as any other type of metalwork.  Unlike authentic natural patinas, this Vintaj product has more of a painted look.  Because of their somewhat shiny satin finish, they look a bit more like enameled or even cloisonn finishes in my opinion.  For those projects that you'd prefer a more-authentic matte patina look, I'd suggest using the product&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sophisticated-Finishes/dp/B004BNDH0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sophisticated Finishes</a>&nbsp;instead.  While a bit more expensive, it has a more realistic patina finish to it.  For other projects, though, this Vintaj product can offer a lovely effect.		This particular set, Rusted Hardware, includes three 0.5 oz bottles in the colors (rust, cinnabar, clay) that are intended to resemble that reddish-orange rusted patina that naturally occurs on ironwork over time.  In my opinion, the hues that Ranger chose for most of these patina kits are much too vivid.  However, this particular set, Rusted Hardware, is my favorite because it's less garish.  As far as how to use them, you can apply them in layers, light glazes, mix them, mottle them, or just use one or two colors singly...make it your own.		These patinas are easy to use.  Simply brush on with a clean artist paintbrush.  You can apply it full strength for a more opaque look or else thin it with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vintaj-Glaze-Sealer/dp/B007K0NDWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vintaj Glaze/Sealer</a>.  This glaze can be used as an extender by mixing 1 part patina ink with 3-4 parts glaze.  Colors can be mixed and mottled for interesting effects.  The inks dry quickly (15-20 minutes).  After drying, you can buff over the raised areas of the metal piece to uncover the metallic elements of the design.  For buffing, you can use the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vintaj-Relief-Block/dp/B004VYYF2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vintaj Relief Block</a>&nbsp;or you can improvise.  My block wore out so I just wrapped fine and superfine sandpaper around small wooden blocks -- worked fine.  I think you could probably also use one of those fingernail buffing/filing blocks.		These patina inks don't require sealing, but if you do the sanding relief afterwards to enhance the metal underneath, it's a good idea to use the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/sealer/dp/B007K0NDWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">sealer</a>&nbsp;to prevent the shiny metal from darkening later.		*TIPS:  Patina inks dry quickly, but will dry more quickly if metal is heated before application.  You can also speed drying after painting by using heat gun or blowdryer.  Brushes can be washed with soap and water...but do so fairly quickly or your brushes will be ruined.
0,I have been using these to start herb cuttings in Mason jars. They're perfect.
0,very cute and small, just what I was looking for and the shipping was fast
0,Wonderful!
0,Tiny pin heads but expected Singer quality.
0,I bought this glue based upon other reviewers comments.  I am so glad that I did, this is my new "go to" glue for magnet making.  I make magnets by cutting prints of my original artwork to fit different size glass tiles that I also buy here on amazon, and I use this diamond glaze to adhere the print to the glass.  I use very little for each one and have to make sure it spreads evenly so it can't be seen through the glass tile.  If I use to much glue it looks foggy under the glass.  This glue is strong, dries quickly, and is clear unless you use to much.  I wish it came in a larger size.
0,wonderful tool for quilting
0,Nice!
0,Nice heavy cutters, not too expensive.
0,This seam ripper was a little bit strange to get used to with hand holding position but once that is conquered, wonderful seam ripper and one that everyone should have in their sewing arsenal.  I purchased two additional to give as gifts to family members.  Wonderful product and bright light.
0,I love using rufflers!  They make sewing ruffles so much easier!  This one is a good value for money and great quality product
0,These cute little scissors are ideal for cutting in tight spaces. I've used them on several different materials and they have worked perfectly each and every time. I love the locking mechanism to keep them closed when they are stored. You will love these! A sewers must have!!!
0,I love these glitter pens. They sparkle delightfully on the page, and they're brilliantly coloured even without the glitter! The darker colours do bleed through thin paper, however.
0,very thick stuff
0,A+
0,I have had bobbin cases before when I owned a Singer sewing machine but when I saw this one I love the fact that the bobbins sit inside of the foam and are much more secure and less likely to unwind.  In addition to that great fact being able to get 2 cases for hat 1 case cost in the stores was a bonus. LOVE IT!
0,Very nice. Thank you.
0,What can I say, its pins!
0,Exactly as advertised
0,Product as described
0,Happy with purchase.  Beautiful colors.  Thank you
0,great
0,I am a repeat customer and they are the best!	I ordered from them a while back but, just realized I never left a review. Sorry!	My vinyl is perfect for my business crafting needs and the order was received quickly! I really love the ability to pick any color I want with so many options to choose from.
0,I am happy with my punch, it works well and doesn't hurt my hands to use. I really needed this size of punch and after exploring different companies and reviews, I settled on this one, glad I did.
0,Forget the Rhinestone starter kit. Just buy this and the Hot Fix Rhinestones you want.	If you watch the youtube video on how to do it. That's all you need. And you get lots more product this way. And save money from not buying the starter kit.	Love the product. Super Easy to use.
0,I need an extra star to express how much I love these. I've used other brands of liquid acrylics and acrylic inks... These are closer to inks in consistency, but the pigment load is so much higher than any other brand of acrylic ink I've tried so far. (I have not yet tried Liquitex, so can't compare that.) The colors are vibrant and blend well, and they do all the things that a liquid should do. They do have a shine to them, so if you expect them to blend perfectly with matte acrylics, they will work but you will be able to see the difference in sheen.		The only disappointment is in the three metallics, which do not seem to have the same depth of color or pigment as the others. They are nice, but they do not stand up to the quality of the others.
0,Nice product!  Bought it as a gift!
0,My iron was pulling on some fabrics due to adhesive and or starch burned onto the iron.  I used this and it worked.  I thought	 it would clean also... it did not,  it shined up the iron so it is smooth again but did not make the iron look "new"
0,Used this to make window cards. Works great.
0,Very bright colors
0,I love it! They are the perfect size. I love how you can create you're own snowman!
0,I quilt so I'm always looking for things the make things easier.  One thing I've always wanted to include in my quilts is a twisted log cabin.  I've seen quilts with the twisted log cabin and they are beautiful.  I know you can do them without this stencil set but if there is something to make it easier than why not.  I like it and would recommend this to any quilter that just wants to make easier.
0,These came in their package and in great shape. The colors were vibrant and correct.  This was perfect for me as an amateur/ hobbyist painter.  I recommend this product and would buy it again.
0,These are easy to use and grasp. The yarn glides over nicely. Each hook has it's size engraved into the handle. While hard to read, it is there. A quick scratch with a white crayon will make the imprint pop nicely.
0,I love these dies, very easy to use and great for card making
0,Works just as it is suppose to. I had to stick two facing pages together, 2600 pages to be exact. Having the spray be repositionable helped a lot. I have had the other that isn't repositionable and if you make a mistake, which you do then you are out of luck, but not if you use this spray. I would suggest using it in a well ventilate area. The pages stick together like they are suppose to.
0,meet my expectation!
0,Gorgeous finish. High shine. Great quality and coverage. I would purchase again and again.
0,This is my favorite rotary cutter because the blade automatically retracts OR you can set it so the blade stays out until you retract it manually. Great size, very comfortable, and easily cuts through multiple layers of fabric. Get extra blades so you will always have a sharp one handy.
0,I used this multiple times since the purchase and it is still going strong.  It makes clean cut shapes.  The die cuts at made of thin metal but they are strong and do not bend.
0,Background pattern very versatile
0,Great thread!  worth the money!
0,Crayons. They come in lots of colors. You simply cannot go wrong!
0,Perfect, thank you!
0,Great Product!! I would buy it again!! Great for making jewelry!
0,The stencil is lightweight, but worked well for our project. Even with a four-year-old working on it. Clear and easy to use.
0,This works so well with all my embroidery work and last so long!
0,Nice stencil.
0,Very nice album, i always use the post-bound and wanted to see how the 3 ring albums were and i really like em,
0,Have not used them yet--look good.
0,another nice pic. here. looks good.
0,Very nice selection of well made spatulas and knives.
0,I've used this product for several years and it works better than any masking fluid I've ever tried and I'd give it 10 stars!  You can order in in giant containers from art stores online if you need a big amount of it.i use it for doing watercolor painting. If you have no idea what this does here's the deal, you spread it onto a drawing with an old cheap paint brush. My advice is put some Dawn dish detergent on your brush first. Tip the masking fluid over a couple of times with the lid on to mix it up a little because it has a slight tint color in the bottle which helps you see where it is on your art work when it dries. Next dip the dawn coated old paint brush in the fluid  and you spread it anywhere you want to keep pristine white on your art work or you can use it to make lines or whatever you might need. You can fill in lettering or whatever. When you watercolor you use it to save your whites.  You can paint it over every color you want to save if your heart desires but be aware if you use it over an area you paint, when you remove it the paint might be slightly less colorful than you'd hoped, because it does seem to lift a bit of pigment when you remove it.. It will leave a very distinct and sometimes harsh line around the edge of wherever it's placed. Once again, look on YouTube for examples. As soon as you use it on your painting, put the lid back on your masking fluid, and take a paper towel and get off as much masking fluid as you can from your brush then go rinse it with hot water as soon as you can. NEVER EVER USE THIS WITH A GOOD PAINT BRUSH BECAUSE IT WILL RUIN YOUR FAVORITE BRUSHES.  A good idea might be to put tape on the handle of a junky old brush you've used for Masking fluid so you can find it easily when you need it again and coating the bristles with dawn seriously saves the brush so it can be used longer than expected. It will build up and dry like latex on the brush if you don't clean it as quickly as you can.  If you've never used it before make sure you order a rubber cement eraser which works great to take it off your artwork. Just rub over the  dried masking fluid gently and it will lift off. You can roll your fingers over it too but most people don't want to get oil on their projects or leave dirty finger prints on their work.
0,The best crafting scissors I have ever owned.
0,Love this item - perfect for essential oils. I had my other for over 1 year now and it still looks like new.
0,Love this batting!!!! All types.
0,Beautiful and came with two in the package. Slightly lighter than the picture, super pretty!
0,This is a great little bottle to put your glue in. I really like it. The little tube that comes with it prevents you from using so much glue! Great Seller and fast ship
0,Easy to interchange.  I love the carrying case and the idea of having every size I need with me.
0,This Creative Options case holds Isacord and Floriani mini cone spools of thread nicely. I stick labels on the ends and stack them on shelves for easy, visible storage. They can be carried to classes easily, too. Great, sturdy cases!
0,This is an extremely gorgeous piece of work. It is very time consuming and very detailed. The very detailed small flower were time consuming and I believe if you have a problem with seeing very small details this might not be the project for you.
0,These are simply the best inks for stamping.  Don't waste your money on big stamp pads - these are better.
0,I haven't tried it yet but the quality looks awesome and it's highly recommended.
0,very quiet and I get a steady stream of air.
0,I use this mannequin to pre-stage photo shoots. In some cases it could almost pass for the model except the lights do highlight more off the plastic than they would off natural skin. But otherwise I am very happy.
0,I have to admit to being a bit of a scissor buff - never seem to have enough and still linger over the display of cutting implements at a fabric store. But these make me really happy, and I don't know why it took me so long to order non-stick scissors as I seem to cut through a lot of sticky stuff, particularly duct tape. Whatever they did to make these non-stick, they glide through duct tape like a dream.  Plus, these were not the most expensive of non-stick scissors that I considered, but you cannot go wrong with Fiskars.
0,I really haven't used these yet so can't give a fair review. I did try it just to see if it works and I believe they will come in handy.

0,I bought two boxes of Rit dye after exploring how to make "aqua" for some curtains - I found mixture ratios on the Rit website. Our local Walmart and grocery stores didn't have the colors I needed so I was happy to find them here on Amazon (although quite a bit more expensive). I bought Kelly Green and Teal and measured the proper amounts of each, then did the dying on my stove with hot water.		The dye set on the curtains properly, without streaking or inconsistent results. I only needed a small amount from each box, but I saved the rest (box securely sealed in a ziplock bag!) in hopes that I'll be able to use it on something else some day.		Rit has been around since I was a child in the 60s and 70s, so I know it's a time-tested and trusted product. It's an inexpensive way to personalize clothes or other fabrics, and the variations of colors are endless.
0,WORKS JUST GREAT
0,Absolutely love them!! They're perfect for either total wet blending or blending with a visible line remaining. I'm terrible at mixing colors from tubes or pans, especially flesh tones, and these pencils are like I died and went to heaven.  Very easy to control, very natural looking.  It also didn't take hours of practice to get a handle on using them, I got the hang of them fairly quickly.  REALLY glad I bought these.
0,Haven't gone wrong with oracal vinyl yet, I love their products, such good quality in their products.
0,These are nice beads, consistent in size and shape, and the colors go well together. They don't get five stars because the picture and discription doesn't let you know just how much the colors lean towards blue. It's not a big problem, it's just not quite what I was looking for.
0,Perfect, very sturdy. I actually use them for keepsake storage...cards, letters, etc. and I can label the front (Mother's Day, etc), which I love.
0,These water colors are absolutely beautiful. I was looking for a set with a wide variety of colors to mix and play with. The colors are vibrant and flow really nicely. Some of the colors are opaque and some are super transparent. The set comes with a guide for the colors and some have repeated pans.
0,So far the colors seem to be exactly as I envisioned but I have two pet peeves. I apreciate not putting numbers on spaces marked for white. However, the cream color (#2), yellow (#3) and light green (#6) needed several coats to cover up the numbers, making those areas much thicker than surrounding colors. Additionally, dark green (#8) clumps excessively. I've been working fairly consistently on this one for about two months and am just "okay" with it.
0,I love this lace. It's very pretty and I have used it for many different things. I would like to buy it again sometime.
0,I love doing things with my granddaughter and making something pretty together is always a blessing and a joy.  This product is perfect for you to sit down with a loved one and use it to make beautiful jewelry. We have made several different types and had just a good time doing it. Product is sturdy  and you have quite a few to really use.  Makes beautiful presents when you add to it, or leave it as is.  Well made. Very happy with it.  Product received for a honest review.
0,Just what I needed. Works great
0,Wonder Tape works great
0,Great directions, several zipper pulls included!
0,looks like a dark red, but once you add water to your brush and use, its a dark orange, great color.
0,Good product!
0,Love these !  Great price great product fast shipping.
0,This works so good on card making
0,Perfect size. And my grown daughter immediately fell in love with this one. She will most likely borrow it for some of her own Christmas crafting and to do crafts in her own home.
0,Item was what I expected. Great quality. They keep the bobbins organized, clean and neat. I will order more again from this seller. Thank you for a great product.
0,Perfect color! Packets say to add water and shake but the pouch did not dissolve fully and caused issues with application.
0,No circular needles work as well for me as the Addi Turbos. this is especially true when I'm working on a project with hundreds of stitches. Many brands work well when you're only knitting a circle of 16 inches or so, but when you're working a sweater in the round you need the smoothness of the Addi Turbo.
0,Item received in great condition.
0,I ordered a size larger than I need, but I'm keeping it and will see if I really want to order the smaller one, also. It's a great, standard masonite drawing clip board.
0,Waiting for mine to arrive but I know I will love it! This will be my 3rd Brother. I had no issues with previous ones, I am just upgrading. The link below is a video that will help you set the needle to the middle position and it will stay until you reprogram it. Enjoy the relaxation and creativity of sewing 	[...]
0,I use this awl to make stitching holes in leather. I love this series of Clover's sewing tool, looks nice and works great!
0,I love the look of these DPN's, and the fact that you get 6 needles with each size. I knit fairly loosely, and usually have problems with stitches falling of my DPN's, but I didn't have that problem with this set of needles even though the sitiches glided smoothly over the needles when I needed them to.		The one issue I do have with the needles is that if you have a stitch patterns that put a good bit of pressure on the needles they will break, or at least one of mine did. Knit Picks has great customer service, so when I called them, at the number on their website, for a replacement all I had to do was give them my Amazon order number, and the replacement needle was in the mail to me the next day at no cost to me, other than having to hold off on finishing my project until I received the replacement (I believe Knit Picks will only cover their needles sold through Amazon if the seller is Knit Picks, so I made sure of the seller before purchasing the needles).  All in all I am very happy with the needles, but will use sturdier needles when a pattern calls for stitches that puts more than average stress on the needles.		UPDATE 8/15/17 - My replacement needle arrived today, and to my surprise Knit Picks sent me a set of 6 size 2.5 DPN's not just one!
0,Best product for embossing powder.
0,Nice leather strips and worked well for my project.
0,I ADORE Dr. Ph. Martin's inks.		The colors are true to how hey appear in the bottle (once any sediment has been properly shaken up and suspended), truly waterproof, no fading. The ink doesn't run and bleed everywhere, it works with every nib I've tried (quite a range, every modern leonardt, almost every modern speedball, several others), and almost every paper (anything your nib scratches to bits is obviously out of the question). It is a thicker ink than many others you might find--it flows beautifully, smooth without breaks, but you don't want to, say, leave it in a roundhand nib with a reservoir untouched for ten minutes. It is ink. It will dry.		But that just leads me to another plus--it's easy to clean out. Once dry it flakes off nibs at the touch of fingernail, not counting unfortunate grooves. It responds well to nib cleaning solution, abd of course when wet (again, not counting grooves where any ink would get stuck) it wipes right off with paper. I've also found that it come out of my scrap cloth with little effort, but don't go spilling it on your carpet or favorite white shirt and expect it to come out. I just mean that the scrap I use for cleaning isn't blackened from these.		They also are wonderful in painting, and again waterproof, so you can do things like soaking a drawing in tea to make it appear aged without worrying about losing the drawing.		And so many colors. I have four sets now, and a couple of additional bottles of the colors I use very often (black, blue, red, brown, gold).		Really. I cannot recommend these inks enough. If you're not sure that you'll make use of all the colors (though I find that I discover uses once I have them), buying individual bottles is an excellent idea. I'm sure that once you try it you'll be as satisfied as I am. I welcome any questions.
0,I like it but not much yarn  the balls are smaller and you need more  in fact many more for a throw  But it is worth it.  For a scarf  I needed four balls
0,Thanks
0,just received seem to work just fine would buy again
0,This Tear Mender works great! We purchased this to use on our Sheltie's ears to get them to tip over. It holds great without irritating her skin. We will purchase again for another puppy.		The item was exactly as pictured and described and arrived very quickly. Great price especially considering this product is hard to find!
0,Love it! I didn't even use glue to get these sculptures to attach incredibly solidly. Doesn't expand or crack. Easy to mix. I'm in love.
0,SUCH A GREAT DEAL!
0,If you sew, you need Clover Wonder clips. I had 3 projects ready for binding when these arrived.  They truly make a world of difference!  These are not for your WANT list, put them on your NEED list.		I tested them out on leather which always show my pin marks. They hold wonderfully.  I had to place silk piping on silk and it held firm.  This product will make a huge impact in my projects, plus save me time. They are faster then pinning and then removing pins. The 50 pack was just what I needed and the price was better than any coupon at the fabric/hobby stores would have offered me.		I highly recommend this product to all sewers, not just quilters!!
0,I needed stretchy strong cording to make a string of jingle bells attach to a saddle horn for horseback riding.  The bells alert deer that the horse is coming and prevents it from being spooked and the horse won't rear or buck off the rider.  This is perfect, easy enough for young hands to stretch around the saddle horn and I used wire to make a look and attached the string of bells.
0,These are super cute and the perfect touch for a product I've made for my business. I usually order from "Amazon Prime" since they guarantee to ship quickly, and make things right when there's a problem. But I'm so glad that I bought these. I'm ordering more, and look forward to seeing what else this seller has to offer. Thanks!
0,Love it
0,Great quality.  Recommended.  I love the way these gears look and feel.  Great for crafting.
0,I like these lever back earring, but I'd like them even more if they were a bit longer!
0,WOW is pretty much spot on. While the jar arrived with a large crack on the side, it was held together by the label just fine. Tried it out right away on black card stock with Versamark beneath and it looks great. Melted just fine and has a good depth and shine to it. The amount of powder in this jar is HUUUUUGE. Give some to all of your friends, since you'll never be able to use all of this is a lifetime.
0,These blanks are easy to stamp but not flimsy. Good quality! In the picture I was using 3mm letter stamps (to show size estimate).
0,Pretty much as described except the edges are not as good as the picture. You can tell the ragged edge is obviously printed on. Not as realistic as the picture seems to indicate. Arrived on time.
0,Works as intended. My only wish would be that you could put them on the end of the crochet hooks when not in use, but they only fit on the end of the cord sets.
0,The first thing that attracted me to these needles was the color, I love anything with color and it makes my day when I see all the needles in the see through bag. Secondly, it has needles up to size 11, which is perfect because it saves money on having to buy extra or more individual sets. I have no problems knitting as the needles are not slick at all, the yarn glides effortlessly onto the needle without any hooks or snags. The cords are super sturdy and do not come unhooked as I knit. I would recommend hanging the cords on the edge of a bookshelf or some other sharp corner with the needles attached after knitting. Each cord is wound into a circle in individual packs, when you first start knitting, because they have been in the packs in a circular position, its a little awkward to knit at first. Letting them "hang out" with the needles on the end provides some weight to get the circle shape out the cord.
0,I like the feel of the pencil on the paper.  Not grainy or sharp.  More soft.  Decent color choices for the number of pencils.
0,Very comfortable to hold crochet hook. Have occasional wrist/hand pain from an injury, can use this brand without any added discomfort. Cannot use other ergonomic brands. Use mostly a pen hold with hook, but I believe these hooks work equally well with either main method of holding hooks. Like the pretty pink colors too.
0,excellent
0,Worked Well!
0,I use the crap out of this; love it
0,I really like this light weight, smooth set! Metal needles get sticky when the humidity is high. These stay dry, plus are quiet. I had never used a shorter length before, but these were perfect for the scarves I made. Just be careful not to break them. I happened to break one of the first pair I had when they caught on a chair as I was putting them away
0,Great
0,I never actually intended to make the color wheel. ordered this product because I thought it would a great way to get a lot of colors and different patterned fabric at a great price.  I plan to use it on an some primary colored airplane appliqu&eacute;s on a baby quilt.  At first I was very disappointed with the colors.  Although the colors are there, they seem muted or dull, not stark and bright but after looking at them for days, I think they will work anyway.  They just don't snap, but are softer colors. The fabric patterns are solid, dots and a weave.  What really sold me is the texture.  The fabrics come open as a stack and were rolled slightly to fit into the envelope.  No creases to try to iron out. As I went through the fabrics I noted how silky they feel. I have picked out the primary colors to use for the appliqu&eacute;s and will add the rest to my stash.  If you compare the price of this bundle to others it is a great value.  Just pay better attention to the prints and the colors you will receive and decide whether it is right for you. I am going to take other reviews advice to heart and prewash them to make sure the colors won't run.
0,You can't really mess up a needle.  So this is all about service.  Great.
0,fine box, but wish have some look
0,When I make jewelry I like to add a bit of sparkle. These are perfect. A little light reflection but not to much.
0,Great
0,nice dye - very pretty, vibrant color
0,I used these to hold fabric in place in order to sew. They're safety pins....they worked, there's a lot of 'em, and the sizes vary. I guess they're pretty good.
0,Keeps color sharp and doesn't dry too quickly.
0,saning for a xas gift ,,,, great price.
0,always a handy tool for working Maille!. ordred as a gift, but i love mine which i bought years ago. saves the need for 2 pairs of pliars.
0,This is very handy in a variety of ways.  One use is cutting out pictures from a coloring book!
0,Great - works as expected!
0,Large and clear stencils, perfect for intended use. Will get great use of these over and over as it is very high quality plastic and will not tear or dissolve in the paint.
0,Happy with this purchase. Very sturdy
0,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Serger-looper-and-needle-threader/dp/B002Y1H9DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Serger looper and needle threader</a>		Use it once on my Serger. Worked very well. It must be realized accessing my Sergers Loopers	is not unlike threading a delicate probe into a dark Dragons Cave with intent to emasculate the Dragon and steal its Gold. Possible but quite difficult.		It did the job but the next time it was called upon (new Serger) it was gone. I'm left with the thought that it was a one time device or I misplaced it. I hope it is the latter as the former would create a nagging repeating expense.		If you buy one keep it locked up and it will serve faithfully I'm sure.
0,Cute and useful. Quick delivery. Highly recommend.
0,Ok
0,I will buy this again.  Great yarn.
0,this embossing folder will make a very nice birthday card
0,Wish I found these earlier exactly what I needed for my project

0,I liked it very much
0,granddaughter loved it
0,I love this.
0,These are awesome!
0,Used at a friend's quilting workshop and had to have my own.  Great price and great product.  Has multiple uses for anything small you need held in place.  Highly recommend.
0,Great price for very nice needles
0,Good quality thread.
0,Love spectrum noir!  Great buy!
0,I love these to use with my cling stamps. A very nice variety of sizes, and stamps adhere well. These make it very easy to line up stamps with the white grid lines on them. I'm really pleased with this purchase. Right now the sizes in this package suit my needs, but I know where to go if I need different sizes!
0,This is great to keep your place and folds out to stand up if you want.  I loved it so much, I bought another one!
0,Very pretty colors, although my order did repeat one color - I wish they were all different ones. The material is good, not thin gg ribbon like others.
0,Worked well, quickly shipped.
0,Such pretty washi tape...I love the cute little bears and watering cans on it..	The washi tape is not to thin and its not to wide..And it was super easy to cute.	It is pretty sticky so its stays in place very well...This washi is a little transparent but	still does not take away from how adorable it is.....Looks really cute in my planner :)
0,This is the best for helping make perfect seams.	Thank you	Nancy
0,Just as I expected.
0,Great .  All my sewing parts fit in this box well for my MC9400 Janome
0,This item is as pictured and works fantastically.
0,Nice colors
0,Bought for my sis and she loved it!
0,Just what the doctor ordered for taking the sketching materials with you.  This is perfect for sketching a harbor scene or a beautiful mountain top.  Great product.
0,These Marvy markers are very easy to use
0,Product as described, no issues.
0,What an awesome tool. A must have for any crafter. Great assortment of tools in the adapter set.
0,Just like the one I remember my mother having besides her sewing machine.
0,Perfect sharpener, sharpens pencils very nicely!
0,livraison rapide. produit conforme a descriptif
0,Love this Dye.
0,I always buy this brand and have no problems with them.  They stay sharp and do a great job of cutting fabric.
0,This has all the most useful sizes of jump rings in quantity.  It most convenient way to order jump rings.  It came in a plastic sleeve with a foldover top.  I expected the bag shown in the picture.  I took my rings out of the plastic sleeve and can't get it back in cause it split down the side.  Other than that, it is the best way to order jump rings.
0,I do absolutely love this case. However I needed one that ACTUALLY HOLDS 120 PENCILS or PENS. Upon receipt I discovered that this case has 10 elastic loops per side X 4 sides. Each loop holds only TWO pens, pencils, or thin markers - not the three that some people seem to be able to fit in each (I cannot manage to reproduce the user images where they fit 3 pencils per loop. I just can't do it...)		And so while this case is made out of absolutely beautiful leather, and holds 80 do writing or drawing implements well, in all honesty I cannot see it ever fitting 120 of anything.		(PHOTOS COMING SOON!)
0,Loved everything about these...length is great, but I gave only 4 star's because the metal is very hard! Soft would be better, because I usually put the beads on and do a wrapped loop. I had to do a regular loop and nip off the end's. Will save the pieces for recycling...
0,Love the vivid colors and darker shades too. Have been using them for art projects my mom is doing. She has dementia and loves the bright colors to draw abstract drawings. I love to use the colors in various shades with different shapes and designs in my drawings. Price is good. Finger tips do get dirty, but that's okay because the pastel colors wash off easily. Have to be careful to not press down too hard on paper because the oil pastels break easily. Recommend this product for all ages.
0,I love making earrings with these posts!
0,This is a great cartridge for background.  The fact that you can change the sizes makes it really wonderful.  What more need I say?  They work for what I bought it to do.  This is not a fav, but I will get my use out of it.
0,Got it to have it.
0,Very, very clever
0,I'm loving these hooks. They glide through the yarn -- no snagging or drag at all. They will speed up your crocheting and are easy on the wrists. I definitely recommend them!
0,Nice variety of Microns and I Really like the included pencil, although I wish it came with extra leads.
0,Very nice boxes for floss and threads for needlework. Only downfall is they came with cardboard floss holders.  Last one I purchased came with sturdy plastic ones.
0,Why did I wait so long?  Your price was WONDERFUL!  Thank you again!
0,good quality yarn! will use again
0,I bought this for a class I was taking, I had no idea how to use, since purchasing, after using at my class, the possibilities are endless on using the Gelli Mat...
0,Just what I was looking for
0,Very nice! The results are easy to to extricate from the mold and pleasantly appealing.
0,nice little nipper for certain projects. wold buy again:
0,Great craft
0,How did I sew without this?!? I can't sew a straight line to save my life, but the walking foot takes care of that for me. I've used it several times now with zero issues. It is officially my favorite presser foot.
0,Gorgeous beads, well polished, definately going to buy more down the road.
0,Love it!
0,I really like my Jukebox, but I hated the clunky appearance.  Besides, who wants to snap the top off and put it back on every time they need something that's inside, such as a keypad overlay or manual?  Even when you're using Design Studio, you still need to refer to the little manuals that accompany each cartridge, and I find it more convenient to keep them stacked next to my Cricut.  Fortunately, the business part of the Jukebox -- the top part -- is completely separate from the storage part of the unit, and it sits perfectly flat on the table next to the Cricut, which looks a little nicer and doesn't take up as much space. As cartridges seem to be proliferating around here, thanks to Amazon's great prices, I will probably need another Jukebox to connect to the one I have before too long, and I only just got my Cricut two weeks ago!
0,I love the way this looks with my jewelry I design
0,These chains are amazing! They are very durable and easy to work with.
0,These storage jars are SUPER!  I've purchased more than 20 sets for organizing my seed beads, silver charms, jump rings, trinkets, single earrings and much more!  The case that comes with the jars is not the strongest, and yes, a few of the shipments have been with the cases having cracked corners, but it doesn't affect the organizing or stacking of the cases.  The storage jars themselves have secure screw-on lids and are clear plastic to easily see the item inside.  The clear plastic case that holds the jars stacks wonderfully- they are sturdy and if you want to get organized, be efficient and enjoy a simple set up for your crafts, jewelry supplies or tiny collection of anything, THESE WORK PERFECTLY!!!  I am writing this review because I'm actually on Amazon tonight to purchase another handful of these containers.  I wish I could add a picture to show you how wonderful these work for my supplies.  I'm looking to not only organize my time, but to simplify the work... and these storage containers have been the answer!!!
0,Just started coloring again after about 45 years of not.  It is a great stress reliever, very calming.  I'm always on the look for colored pencils that are decent to use.  I prefer fluid movement with pencils, and these produce just that.  Sometimes you buy a brand that isn't embedded in our brain since childhood so you're leary.  I took the challenge and bought these, and I'm very impressed with the quality.  Easy to sharpen, you know how some pencils sharpen and you wind up with btoken tips?  These dont.  Ive used electric and hand worked sharpeners, just to test, and these never splintered or broke.  Very nice selection of colored pencils and I'm glad I purchased!  I recommend these. I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
0,No complaints, I got exactly what I ordered -10 sets of Tree of Life Pendant Kits. These are adorable and quite useful, creatively speaking that is. There's 10 of them,  each one has a cabochon glass bead - these have flat backs however, so they can't be filled. You will need to glue these together, there is some assembly required. I suggest gluing the picture to the metal part, allowing that to dry and then gluing the glass cabochon to the picture. Use transparent drying glue!		Feel free to ask me any questions I will do my best to assist.
0,I have a tendency to lose fish hook or French style back earrings that have no grips.  These help prevent that from happening.  I've had no trouble using them with any of my earrings.  They fit snugly, keep the earrings in place, and are practically invisible.  I didn't count them, but there are probably more in the bag than I'll ever use.  I recommend them to anyone needing earring grips.
0,Perfect.
0,I love Creative Grids rulers!!! I have replaced all of my older rulers with these because they stay in place better!!
0,I use these on my Brother SE400. I am very satisfied with this product and pretty excited that I am all stocked up in needles! I would recommend this product.
0,This die set makes a nice card but since purchasing it, I see there is a bigger die set that is nearly the same. I would skip this one and go with the other. It really wasn't what I wanted. The flip part is small and there's not enough room inside for a sentiment. I should have read these comments!
0,Beautiful color and texture! Great for the Prayer Shawls I make with it
0,love this muti ppck of knitting needles I can be knitting two different projects same time ,I like to have two projects in the works so when tired of one go to the other swap off back and forth
0,Nice
0,Great quality for its intended purpose. Product picture matches the actual product.
0,I have become hooked on paper punches and this one is generously sized and great for all kinds of projects. It works well and I would feel confident recommending it to other paper crafters. Service all around was good.
0,Nice ink pad with a good amount of ink and density. Good results!
0,Great set, want the completed one
0,Just as described
0,Just what was needed to make the mini albums.  Could not find locally.
0,Just love these gelatos. They are creamy and smudgey and blend so nicely.
0,We like to use Sculpey for beads and other art creations.  Nice as always.
0,Perfect for the job.
0,practical, helpful
0,Pretty and fun way to tape a gift!
0,These are VERY easy on the hand as far as cutting. Very ergonomic, easy to squeeze and nice and sharp, too!  Recommended to me by a physical therapist after I had successful carpal tunnel surgery on my right hand. As a volunteer, I annually trim and compile thousands of small BoxTops for Education for a local school and these scissors are making my life so much easier.  Also great for snipping my cross stitch threads, too.  I highly recommend these!
0,love this die--very detailed and fun to work with!
0,This is the first time I am trying this particular block, the crazy patch.  Directions were easy and I made my first block.  You can get very creative with all the scraps you may have, plus you add embellishments.  Think of all the different types of fabric to use, velvet, silk, cotton etc.  Would make a beautiful purse.
0,For hours of fun!  My son thought it was a block of cement when we had it wrapped under the Christmas tree, but he loves it!  He will use it for hours!
0,ChiaoGoo circular knitting needles are definitely my favorite needles that I own.  I purchased the Red Line needles in two sizes by mistake.  Usually I purchase the Lace.  The most noticeable difference between these needles seems to be the angle at the end of the needle near where the cable attaches.  I've always guessed that this design in circular knitting needles is intended to somehow guide the cables downward or away from you.  The thing is that I do a lot of magic loop knitting and this bend in the needles causes my cables to sort of go in a direction that isn't necessarily convenient.  When I use these needles for larger projects where I'm not running magic loop, I find that the directional bend is hardly noticeable.  The needles are lightweight and smooth.  The cables are sturdy and really hold up to a lot of wear and tear.  ChiaoGoo needles are my go-to knitting needles for comfort and speed.  One day I plan to own every size - in Lace, though.
0,Nice, sturdy.
0,This is fantastic. I wish I would've bought a magnetic pin cushion years ago. I don't have to worry about knocking over a box of loose pins because the whole box fits on this magnet, and I don't have to pause my sewing to stick pins into a cushion because this magnet is so strong, as long as you chuck the pins in its general direction they'll stick to it. I bought a box of 100 pins and stuck all of them on top of this magnet without a problem. I could probably even fit more, but they wouldn't be stuck as firmly and I would start to worry that they'd fall off and get lost. This pin cushion also has little rubber or silicone pads on the bottom to keep it from sliding around on the table, and the weight is heavy enough that it won't go flying if you bump it with your hand or your fabric while sewing. The little box for extra pins is handy as well. I keep hand sewing needles in it so I have my needles and pins all in one place.
0,Perfect for a power cable on my MacBook that was failing and had wired exposed.
0,Awesome
0,good product
0,This is a great little machine for the price.  I have had it several years and it still works wonderfully.  I use it almost everyday for embroidery on items that I sell.  It is very easy to use.  I also purchased a software called Amazing designs to use with the machine, the software gives me additional fonts and the ability to write several lines of letters and to be able to edit it more exactly. Amazing designs is around $99 and is great for embroidery patterns too.  You can purchase many great designs inexpensively on Etsy, download them to your computer, then open them with amazing designs, get them the right size or edit them then transfer to your sewing machine.  It is very easy to transfer designs to the machine from your computer.	The machine has a lot of extras that most inexpensive machines don't have, like the automatic thread cutter (a must have), bobbin low alert, and easy to use automatic needle threading.  It sews very well, great for piecing quilts.  I think this is an excellent machine.  If you have never sewn before,  this is the machine for you.  Very easy to learn on.
0,Excellent quality paint.  I am happy with the purchase.
0,Clickitty clack the 50's do the knotting right along with the knitter
0,I love the feel of these needles.  I knit a LOT and usually use clover bamboo.  This could make me change over, if I need additional sizes, they feel that good.  I would have liked a little longer lead on the circular, I don't think you can make anything too big on here, and when it's a size 19 needle, you may want to make a blanket or something.
0,summer projects.
0,Perfect for all of my pencils. Allows me to tune points to suit project
0,good quality, quick shipment
0,Beautiful stencil
0,Love the metallic markers. Great for the price.
0,I ordered them just in case I wouldn't be able to find any later. LOL For me, these will last a long time so for the price, well worth it!
0,Great item at a great price!
0,I wanted a glass cutting mat to sit on my desk for my crafts....the larger, the better.  This was the largest I could find at a reasonable price.  I love that it has sizing information on  all sides.  It is strong enough to withstand pressure while cutting cardstock and other items but thin enough to hold all sorts of canvases and other media for my crafts.
0,I love using sealing wax on my correspondence. Thanks Outop for a nice seal!

0,I always have trouble with masculine looking cards, but have really enjoyed these stamps to make both masculine and feminine cards.  Really versatile stamps.
0,Wonderful brushes. Helps to add creativity to my art work
0,I got the small shears last year and loved them but they were not good for cutting loarge pieces. I got 2 pairs of these and they have replaced by conventional scissors in my heart. No pain in those knuckles and a nice loose hand hold
0,Fast delivery, excellent product.
0,Love this.
0,Love, love, love this product! A subtle shimmer for an elegant touch to my art work. I am planning on ordering this product in colors.
0,Love this for my applique it does not gum up my needle when embroidering and keeps the edges from fraying
0,I love these! So smooth and light. Only complaint would be one of them was catching on my yarn a bit, but was easily fixed with some 400 grit sand paper.
0,Paintbrushes arrived quickly and were of good quality.
0,I'm making mini-sketch books with these for the covers. Good stuff.
0,the n umbers are easy and clear for me to see. like very much
0,I totally love the shimmer this clear glitter brush gives.  Very easy to apply, even in small places
0,Great price for a quality pair of shears. My mom pays a lot more for name brand shears. I like these just as much. Cant beat it.
0,Perfect
0,Good selection of beads. Beautiful light blue color.  Packaged to prevent damage to the product. Service was fast.
0,These are amazing! All the years I spent poking & burning my fingers trying to make my own bias tape (which always came out wonky), when all I needed was the right tool?! You could pay double this price for just one size. This deal includes 4! Excellent quality-Excellent value. Every sewing box should have them.
0,Good set. Convenient companion for my Cotman Compact Set.
0,Exactly what I wanted
0,Great Washi Tape for the Holiday season.  Scrapbookers will love it and its a nice group of tape in a single package.
0,I used this to make a 3-D centerpiece. It works very well.
0,This is a great set of zippers for the $8 price tag. I didn't get the exact colors pictured (ordered from Yaka), and ended up with a lot more blue ones, no orange ones, no black ones, and some brown ones. I wish more neutral-colored zippers were included, so that the colors would be easier to pair with projects. About 5 of them had zipper pulls with the paint worn down along the raised edges, but they were not significant. I would repurchase these again.
0,Red Heart is a great quality product. My wife ran short on a project she was working on. Got perfect color match so she could finish her project.
0,There are many cardinals around in Williamsburg, and they make such a beautiful addition to the scenery where I live. This PBN captured that feeling of the cardinal's bright contrast to the colors around him -- set off by the little berries on the tree branches in the snow.		I just can't resist the beauty of this picture. The design is quite sophisticated, and the company that produced this PBN kit only uses the best quality components for their craft kits.		If you love the relaxation of PBN, this would be a great project to do next!
0,Great die, works well. Makes creating a stand up card easy and fun.
0,I got the 9 Jewel Colors Halo Jewel Metallic pack. These are so much fun! I think I can find many uses for them.  They color almost any surface.  I used them to paint on cellophane fairy wings and they came out beautiful.  The color spreads evenly and is translucent. The shades blend well. This particular set is Metallic.		2/13/2018- I bought these again and painted a pair of black boots with them. Theyre really incredible and I highly recommend them.
0,Exelente
0,If you're an artist, you may never use the harder pencils (3H, 4H), and you might want even softer ones than the 6B, but these are excellent pencils anyway. The degree of hardness is clearly printed on all six sides, making them easy to locate when they're spread all around the desk ... ahem ... and you gotta love the tin they're in.
0,I MADE NICE EMBROIDERY!!!
0,really like the product, now that I have had a chance to use it
0,I bought these to make some prototype 3D printed fishing lures for my dad who is an avid bass fisherman.  These helped complete the project very nicely. I would definitely buy these again for my project or many other craft projects that these could be useful for.
0,achieved just the color I wanted.  I dyed towels...a few a turquoise and a few lavender.  Both turned out quite well.  I've found Rit dyes to last a good long while, too.
0,I use this in a home-brew acrylic paint thinner. Works great. This can also be used as an airbrush lube.
0,Great product
0,It is very delicate, but pretty
0,very easy to use
0,I love these!  It took me some time to get used to holding them, because they are huge.  I knitted scarves for Christmas gifts using these needles.  I did a straight knit using two different colors of super bulky yarn and the loos pattern turned out beautifully.  I am a new knitter and a scarf took me about an hour.  I would definitely use super bulky yarn, though, otherwise, the knit it is too loose and the strands catch very easily and warp what you are making.
0,Great product!  Plan to buy again in the large size.  Does not slip off the way the old fashioned kind do.
0,Fast delivery.  Beautiful.
0,Great elastic for beading!
0,As a heads up. This product is three ninety nine at a popular craft store, before coupon. It does work fantastically though. I keep it in my desk drawer at work. Amazed at how many times I've reached for it, for myself and co-workers.
0,These tiny little spacers make a beautiful seperation between your beads. I recently did bracelets and necklaces with pearl grey beads using these inbetween and they looked so elegant. They were a smash hit for the bridal party. Who would have thought something so small and reasonable would have done the trick. Great buy.
0,Very useful - Thank-you!
0,Perfect
0,This adhesive is great for lots of things, but especially for gluing on gems for craft products.  It is thick, holds well, dries fairly quickly and does not flake.  I have been very pleased with this product.
0,Great yarn, arrived in a timely manner.
0,Great!
0,Muy bueno
0,What a fun plate! Easy to clean and use, just wish they were cheaper - I'd get more sizes! One thing though, air bubbles from the plastic cover and case create slight indentation in the plate that will show up on your print. To avoid this, make sure nothing is touching one side of the plate when storing in it's plastic case.
0,very useful.
0,I made some amazing candles with this.  I was mistaken at first in thinking they only gave me 8lbs, I did in fact get the whole 10lbs.  The candles turned out perfect and OMG it was the easiest thing ever.  Candlescience online gives perfect instructions on how to make the candles
0,I like giving good reviews, but for these gloves....I have to say 'THESE ARE FABULOUS!" I suffer with neck and shoulder pain while quilting, but these gloves relieve at least 50% of that pain. I also have tennis elbow on my right arm. The glove makes it possible for me to relax my arm a great deal and still gives me total control of the quilt....instead of grabbing and holding I can lay my hand flat and move the quilt easily.  I can honestly say you will love these!
0,Love these!  Tamed my wire drawer!!
0,Great die luv it.
0,Perfect for my use. It sits on my large mat and I can cut the small items neatly.
0,Small item that is great for surfaces and canvases and other crafts. Only 2 ounce can. I think a little goes a long way. The color depth is good.
0,works really well
0,Nice accurate ruler.
0,While this isn't what I have been searching for, it will still come to good use.  I have bibs or bags or lots of others things I can use it for!
0,Great product. Thanks!!!
0,love these
0,I love these. They are great. I ordered four of them -- Fun, Pinwheel, Metalextra Alchemy, and Autumn Pastels. The Autumn Pastels are chalk paint -- I wanted to try them all! -- and I should receive those today. The colors are strong and easy to use. I didn't have any problems with drying. Of course, I didn't use them heavily, just normal amounts. I tried letting them dry on their own and using a drying gun (recommended) -- with and without embossing -- everything worked. I must say that the metalextra colors work best embossed (as recommended). While trying them out, I embossed a bee on black paper using some bright colors. I used a cosmetic wedge to lift the color off the triangle, and then dab it in a stencil. It turned out great. The darker metallic colors are best on white or off-white paper (as are the bright colors), and the 3 lighter metallic colors look best on black or darker paper. Regular ink stamps do not work well on black, but pigment inks work well on darker colors because it IS paint.		I attached three pictures showing the bee and the 3 lighter metallic colors on black paper. You can see that the darker metallic colors don't show up as well on the darker paper -- maybe if they were embossed!? NONE of the metallic colors in these 2 pictures are embossed.		I have now tried them with a gel medium. You MUST embossed to use a gel medium. The bee came out fine, but the unembossed metallic colors smeared a little -- but not too much. So, yes, emboss.		I will be purchasing more.
0,Love these wee size beads to sew on doll clothes and beading doll sweaters that I knit. They are difficult to find in the stores.
0,These are cute and exactly what I wanted.
0,This is a work saver, but don't drop it.  They shatter.  Arrived intact and on time.  A little pricey for a piece of chaulk.  But other types aren't as sharp.
0,Awesome size and nice quality, but the limited range of motion on the fingers and thumb is frustrating.
0,They came 10 days sooner than the estimated date. They look exactly like the picture. They are difficult to remove from the sheet but they are very cute.
0,These are well made tools. They were priced nicely, and they feel really smooth in the hands. It's nice to have three in case one gets lost or if you want to share.
0,I am glad to have something this large to cut out items with my Silhouette Cameo. Great for any project
0,I recently got an adult colouring book as a gift, what a great stress reliever it is. But I got colour pencil with it. Me being a perfectionist I like Rich colour and the pencils were not doing it justice so I looked online for some art markers and these were recommended. Now I tried to choose between the chisel and the brush tip and ended up choosing the chisel because they were cheaper and everyone I asked said it was personal preference. I'm glad I did choose the chisel, the tip has multiple angles that you can use for colouring. I love these markers.		They do bleed through in my colouring book, which is a thick card stock so be careful. I pick my pictures that I like and end up loosing the picture on the back but that's a small price to pay for pretty pictures.	The colours that come in the package are great, good range.	I couldn't be happier.
0,Good for tiny fill in and knobs for radio.  Replaced worn out writing on plugs of 1975 Stereo reciever.
0,I love this stuff!  I've used it on a variety of items over the years, and not just to decoupage.  It seals all kinds of projects, including painting.
0,The needles were inexpensive and fit the machine perfectly.  They arrived on time and installed perfectly.  This was a good buy.
0,I'd been using the round plastic looms for years, but wanted to upgrade to something a little more refined. This board is fantastic. The pegs have a small gauge which is perfect for making things that need a smaller gauge like socks, things for babies, little animals, etc.. The board is extremely versatile, from huge blankets to tiny little tubes, literally anything is possible with this one device!		If you are used to using the plastic looms, it takes a little bit getting used to the smaller pegs with less pronounced grooves. I find that inserting the hook from the top and "scooping" the yarn over is the easiest, way. Also be careful not to wind the yarn too tightly, you really don't need to to keep the gauge looking good, and it will just make your project extremely hard to work with!		My one problem with this board was that when I got it the adjustment holes drilled into to board were extremely tight. I had to use a hammer to tap out the metal pegs and to reinsert them. My husband couldn't even get them in and out by hand. I was really worried about breaking the board! I contacted the company and they said the tightness was normal, and should diminish over time, but they did offer to send me a replacement board anyway. I thought that was a nice gesture, but instead of going through the hassle of having it replaced, I just got some sandpaper and spent a few minutes sanding down each hole until the metal pegs slid in and out easily.		All in all, I think this board is absolutely one million percent wonderful! 97% of the time it replaces all my other looms, knitting needles, and doo-dads. I like traditional knitting, but this is easier on my hands (remember, don't wrap your yarn too tightly!)!
0,Product works like it was supposed to, delivered on time.
0,pretty, perfect for Easter cards.
0,great for protecting your table, ease of lining up fabric, lightweight to carry and store, easy cutting and guiding with cutter and ruler. Love it glad I purchased it.
0,Perfect for beading
0,Yes I used these almost every day for one thing or another.  I'm experimenting with card making and I'm using these on anything I can squeeze through my Big Shot.  These add a polish to edges or ends of a card.  I use these so much I may need to replace them soon.
0,Love these brushes.
0,Good for sketches and maybe final if you are careful.
0,Totally adorable! Love the variety of designs. I would've preferred a little more tape, but for the price, I'm satisfied. I would definitely buy more.
0,........i'm using these stars for a projet and they are very nice looking.......small but that's what i wanted......especially like the silver......to me it looks classier
0,EVERY seamstress needs these. Love, love, love.
0,I love all the possibilities this pack of paper gives.  I make paper flowers which technically aren't origami but they start out as that so this pack of paper is going to be perfect for making more flowers!  You can read my full review here: http://www.justmarriedmomof3.com/2015/04/09/orchid-origami-paper-origamipapers-review/
0,Perfect condition upon arrival, color true to what's pictured.
0,Sharp and pointy. Cuts to the very tip. Excellent!
0,So many things to use this stamp with! I just really enjoy these products.
0,Exactly what I wanted
0,excellent!
0,Looks just like the photo and fits comfortably in my hand. Easy to change and holds well. Good price, very pleased.
0,I always want to challenge myself on the 4th of July when I make my daughter-in-law's birthday card. These dies proved to be perfect in keeping with the Stars and Stripes theme I was going for and I was thrilled with the results. A little imagination goes a long way.
0,Super deal.  LOVE the charms.  They are great for crafting necklaces, bracelets, etc.
0,Good value
0,I have not used it yet but it looks and feels like good material that is why I gave it a 5  when I use it which won't be for awhile I will update how I .feel about it then
0,good
0,These are great for getting into small places but the ends bend too easily.
0,thank you
0,A little goes a long way! Even though it's a small bottle it really lasts. Good coverage and really works to use chalk on it!
0,This too was bought for someone, got no complaints
0,These paints are really high quality for the price. The only problem is the opacity, they are a little on the transparent side so it takes more coats of paint than with other more expensive brands. Overall they are pretty good though.
0,I love these! They're so delicate and pretty. Very very very very tiny - tinier than I could have imagined but perfect for what I needed.
0,it's as expected
0,These match the coordinating paper pad!  Looking forward to some fun projects.
0,I loved making a blanket with these. I had plastic needles and over time part that attaches to the cable starts chipping so that the yarn snags as you move it up the needle from the cable. These have a lovely smooth transition from cable to the needle and I finished my blanket very quickly. I've love to get a whole set. The wood is so smooth and I had no snagging issues at all.
0,good
0,Exactly as expected.
0,Great price, good color and quality, just as described
0,These are ok but not as nice as the first ones we bought
0,I love the colors that come in the set.  It offers me a lot of variety in my projects without having to constantly be mixing my own colors (which is always the most painful part for me).  That being said it doesn't cover as well as my other slightly more expensive paints, so I end up using more of it then I would the other brand, but I guess you get what you pay for.  For most projects, I believe these paints would meet your needs!
0,great
0,I got this to use as book board.  It's a bit thinner than I like, but 2 glued together would work.  Easier on the wallet than Davey board.  If only the maker could make this twice as thick, it would be Awesome!!!  Fast shipping.
0,very happy with my purchase, great for using on a peg loom,  color is consistent and as described, soft with a nice weight to it.
0,Beautiful to work with!
0,I always use this poly-fil. I make a lot of toys for children and I find that this is the best.
0,I love these pastel pencils. Definitely my favorite and would highly recommend.
0,Perfect for my crafting when using my hot glue gun &/or heat gun
0,I didn't understand why these were so highly recommended until I bought one on a whim.  Wow! It's saved me a lot of time! I would always have to mark points before making a line, and now I can measure and draw/cut in one step.  This is highly recommended for quilters, but I'd recommend it for drafting and model making, too! Anything where you need to cut or draw parallel straight lines.		Do get one that has the angle markings like this one does. You may not think of a use now, but it could come down the road! I just recently needed to make squares around a 45* line and it was so easy using the 45* guideline on this ruler!
0,Love graphic 45
0,Good pigment, etc.
0,Very convenient.
0,These are perfect for creating all the different versions of skin tones that I find myself looking for photos of people with a wide variety of skin tones and shades. I love having this variety of colors devoted to creating portraits, I am no longer confined to just a few variations.
0,I like this pen a lot. It's great for tracing pattern pieces onto fabric, whether it's dark fabric or light. I bought it so as to have an all purpose tracer, and it's just that. It has just enough stick to stay on the fabric while you're cutting but still easily rub off of the pieces once cut.
0,Perfect body die.  Cuts out nicely.
0,Love the dies....
0,Great grip and sharp
0,second one I have bought! Love them.. wear them out! :) fun fun fun! highly recommend if you enjoy making things-
0,it is an essential item for the cricut and I was able to get them at a good price here
0,I used these as part of my Halloween costume (I was a tree).  The leaves are lightweight and disposable. They sew on easily.  I sewed some at the end of the fingers of my gloves, and will save the rest to decorate my table.
0,I have never used this before and was not sure how it would work. you iron it on to a piece of fabric, cut out your applique or whatever, peel off the remaining paper backing from the applique, then iron it on what ever you are working on. It is great stuff and I wish I had bought this a long time ago.
0,I really like my purchase of the Easy Rule II.  The measurement markings are large and easy to read.  I like that it is 6 1/2 wide by 24 inches long.		I purchased this ruler to replace my 28 year old rotary ruler the (quickline 2).  I'm not sure why the makers of my old ruler changed it's marking design but they did and it's no longer a useful ruler for me.  I was afraid changing to a new ruler would take some time to get use to but I found it quite easy to move over to this one.  The numbers are larger which is much better for this older gal.  Highly recommend.
0,I find Soft Flex to be the better of the wires on the market.
0,I love spacers
0,I bought the letter packs (5 of them) for a project and they look and feel exactly as they should. I have since used some for other projects and feel like they are a good bargain. I will note that not all letters are represented in each pack, but unless you are trying to spell something specific, it isn't a big deal. Also, if you buy enough packs, all the letters are eventually there.
0,Great
0,I bought these for Colonial Day for the Fourth Grade at my son's school.		I bought these, I bought white, and I also bought white with a black tip. I had all colors of ink for the kids to choose from. I decided at the last minute not to use the black ones only because then the kids might mix up the ink colors from quill to quill.		However, if I had only 1 color of ink (say, black or blue), then I would have definitely used these. And I know we would have loved them. The kids really thoroughly enjoyed using the quill feather pens for writing. They really loved them and did a great job. Didn't want to leave the station!
0,Nice set!
0,Wonderful accessory fr my dolls.
0,Bought these to keep my cat from eating the thread. They work well and stack nicely
0,As a Cuttlebug fan, I've never been disappointed with their products.  These cut and emboss templates are great for making greeting cards.
0,Wonderful! Fast and simple transaction, highly recommend
0,Excelent
0,Pretty
0,thanks
0,There is a wide selection of colors. They color smoothly and evenly. They don't crumble or flake like another brand I tried.  The cardboard tube they come in is heavy duty and padded on bottom and top. The colors are numbered, and the bottom ends are color coded. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I would recommend them.
0,Nice fluidity for backgrounds and mixing.
0,I got these to go with the pop up dies for inside the card, but I plan to use them on other cards, too. Great patterns, and they cut very well in my Cuttlebug machine.
0,All of Cricut products are good.  Use these a lot.  Too bad they don't last forever, but such is life.
0,I love this product, it far exceeded my expectations and quality and durability, I would highly recommend this to anyone!
0,I was storing all my spools of serger thread on racks attached to the wall.  But, I was finding that they were collecting dust and then the dust would build up just in front of the needles and cause problems.  I've tried storing cones of thread in a box, but it ends up being a tangled mess.  What I like about these trays, is that the wires hold the cones in place.  You can store the bins on their sides or even upside down if you want.  Plus, you can double your storage if you put cones upside down, between the cones on the wire spindles.  A very good product.
0,This is my urban sketching book, used with ink and watercolor to draw scenes from around the Berkeley campus. I chose it for its size, small but not too small, form factor, and most importantly, it's ability to take ink and light washes. While there are tons of cheaper sketchbooks on the market, most fall very short in two departments, ink and water. With ink, the problem is bleeding. Areas of black can add enormous visual impact to a drawing, accentuating the value difference in the overall work, but only if they look sharp and crisp. Less expensive sketchbooks have a bad habit of turning key black areas into ugly black blobs with obvious bleeding. The Handbook never suffers from this problem. Lines, and areas, remain crisp. If bleeding is bad, washes can be even less kind to inexpensive sketchbooks. Pages tend to warp and buckle and washes are absorbed, becoming dull, rather than remaining translucent and glossy. Even higher end sketchbooks (i.e. Moleskine's newly reformulated sketchbook) suffer from this problem. The Handbook doesn't and, really, this is the reason to buy it over less expensive competitors. I find that adding washes of color make my pen and ink drawings infinitely more interesting and compelling, so this feature is essential. After being disappointed by other products, Handbook at last allows me to add washes with confidence.
0,Nice
0,works great, very pure!
0,This is really nice for items that you want a little extra sparkle.
0,These are great little boards for student painting.
0,I love these eyelets. I believe they are one of the best made eyelets currently on the market useful for crafting purposes. I just wish that they had packages consisting of higher quantities.
0,I love using watermixble oils and Reeves is high quality, vibrant colored and at a good price. There's a good selection of colors that are smooth, buttery and has good coverage. I would recommend this set to anyone.
0,This made the felt garland I made VERY easy to do. Nice colors and very stiff felt that held its shape. Adhesive backing made it all very easy!
0,My daughter loves to draw and really do all sorts of art.  I always try to keep varying media in our art supply cabinet, just to keep her interested.  These are really cool metallic markers.  I would definitely buy them again.
0,As expected.
0,Nice opaque ink! Great quality and color!
0,Gorgeous fabric
0,Good work
0,these beads were colorful had ok detail overall very affordable beads.cant find a better deal anywhere.im glad that i purchased them and would recogmend them to friends and family.hats off to the seller.it
0,Thank You
0,They worked so well that I ordered another set. No leaks, they make changing out a airbrush a snap and cost half that of everyone else.
0,Great
0,This is a great tool and have used it a lot.
0,Just what I wanted, and I am "eyeballing" everything in sight.
0,If anyone needs a variety of feet you can't go wrong with this purchase. The price was Great as well as the quality.  It comes in a nice container with descriptions of each foot. Even if you have some of the feet it is always nice to have a spare.
0,Well, like I so often do, I didn't actually read the dimensions for this stamp and thought it was much larger (which is my own fault) but it is a very beautiful and detailed stamp and I will definitely keep it and use it for small craft projects. And although it is made for ink, I actually used it with some polymer clay last night. (see photos) Very detailed! 5 stars *****
0,This great duct tape for duct tape wallets and other crafts.  My daughter got it for Christmas and loves it.
0,Great presser foot!
0,Love it
0,I crochet hats for myself and others and this was a color that I didn't have and the local store didn't have it either so I ordered it and it is a very good color that I was looking for.
0,Very happy nice crochet hooks at a good price . Pretty colors too.
0,Love them!
0,This is a deep and rich vanilla scent. Didn't have to use much and the candles & wax melts that I made smelled very nice. Would buy again!
0,These frames are fun to work with over your embossing folder to imprint the chosen shape.  The blank space in the embossed design is for a stamped message or design.  The stacking instructions are on the package, but I had to add the metal shim for my Cuttlebug to leave a good impression.
0,this system works very easily and the snaps work very well
0,I love paper palettes for easy clean up, but lately I switch to grey pads, because of the neutral background.
0,great pens! very dark.
0,There is so many colors, and the flow is good, smooth and didn't clump. I purchased mine on deal of the day but I would pay full price for the variety and quality of there pens. Mine flowed easy as soon as I started to use them and after several uses still seem to have alot of ink remaining. I am very pleased and would purchase again for myself and as gifts. Great for relaxing coloring for adults and for a child's masterpiece.
0,These are a very nice fine tipped pen. Work wonderfully in those small areas for coloring in. There are plenty of colors , but I did notice that 1 of the oranges has more of a red tint to it when put on paper. there was only 1 pen that I had any issue with and it was a light green which didn't bother me that much since I don't use a lot of the lighter green colors. But by running the barrel under hot water seemed to let the color "drop" and I haven't had any issue since. the colors do not bleed through if the paper is a heavier weight, but with a lighter weight paper there is some bleed thru so you may want to put a blotter paper behind any work you are doing.  The colors are vibrant and they do come in a very nice heavy plastic case so you won't lose them anywhere. I am attaching a copy of a picture that I am working on right now , using these pens for the linework , the wording is done with a marker.	I received these markers at a reduced price for a fair and honest review.
0,EASY TO CLEAN AND USE!
0,I got these sheets to cover assorted smaller boxes for storing things. This "paper" is actually a nice heavy cardstock type paper - in fact, I've seen greeting cards with thinner paper for sure. I was very pleasantly surprised. Each piece has a different design on each side.  Half the pieces a somewhat deeper color scheme and the other half a slightly more faded scheme of pleasant colors and variety of patterns. I can see these having a lot of different craft uses.
0,Making an afghan and needed one more ball of this color.
0,The mat arrived slumped in the box, so slightly bent, but it flattened out just lying overnight on the table.  It is definitely a beautiful cutting surface.
0,PERFECT for drafting and drawing.  I had one just like it in graduate school and wore it out, haha.  Just purchases a new one and am very pleased.
0,Used the white thread, expect the black is the same. Love it. It is too thick to go through needles do I use it on loops.
0,This quick clay is great for beginners on art classes, but it is a bit unstable for more experienced ceramic users. It can be baked in a little oven, but it will easily break.
0,Love these pins, super fine and sharp.
0,so cool great color
0,Dig it!
0,As advertised, 10 to an order. Good looking with a little black added to show the detail. Great for paracord.
0,I love it. I am making mini albums and this stuff works great.  I have even used it on the backs of my photo's, and I have never used glue for that before.  I don't use a lot of glue, just on the edges. A lot of  glues will make your paper bow or ripple.  This does it while wet but once I have my paper glued it lays flat.  A lot of other glues when they dry and you flex your paper the project makes a crackling sound, like it is going to come apart.. This one doesn't. The paper stays supple. This is a great product.
0,Easy to work with and should make nice baskets.
0,Second time purchasing these and we love them. Perfect for our needs!
0,Great Product, Great Price!!!
0,excellent finish and really nice metallic color!
0,Just the right size and texture for my watercolor art.
0,Have used this already. I found the rods very easy to use and got a good blocked result.  I blocked a large fingering weight shawl and a fine quivik scarf.
0,Arrived quickly, undamaged and as advertised!
0,Great additions to my jewelry projects!  Great price for the amount received as well.  Have been using them since I received them, and they just as something special to each piece I create with them.
0,Very satisfied
0,As described. Excellent product. Very satisfied.
0,The wife loves it, good quality at an excellent price!
0,This is great to use. Makes card making easy. Just don't try delicate die cuts they get misshaped.
0,Awesome dies. Love it so much . Made pretty tags with , partly die cut by these dies. Looks great.
0,After watching several tutorials on how to do Tunisian crotchet,  I decided to purchase this hook.  I have absolutely loved using it arrived and it now my favorite hook. It is very sturdy and the perfect size for all of my projects.
0,This pen worked well and was the perfect pink!
0,good
0,It is so nice with my Featherweight. So much easier than the little button that is on the original foot control.
0,Easy to melt and blends well when making your own cosmetics!
0,I knit a lot on DPN's. When you take a break, it is easy for the stitches to slip off if you don't use point protectors. These are good quality and hold on tight until you take them off.
0,Got these for clipping a rag quilt and they work great.  Save a lot of strain on the hands.
0,ChiaoGoo products are great. The steel portion of the handles are the perfect length for my hands.
0,Good price. Does its job.
0,After searching around for the best price I found this package of 36 skeins of embroidery floss, it was definitely the best price I could find for the amount of product. My order arrived quickly in appropriate packaging and I have absolutely no complaints.
0,Great.
0,I love this wire, but then I love all of the Beadalon line.  It is the best quality material out there. ( to me)
0,Perfect and they are big just like in the picture.
0,Great product
0,There were two wedding in my family recently....  and everyone is talking about new beginnings and new families.  I guess I am just planning ahead.  Grandma ALWAYS should be prepared for good news!  This is very cute and I can't wait to get it completed and stored for the next family announcement!
0,I was previously using the wooden ones with the steel inserts and after a few months i was bending and breaking them left and right. These come with so much more selection and variety for all of my sculpting needs.  There is not a tool I wish I had with this set.
0,I am really pleased with this  product.. I have just started using Copic brand  multi-liners and find them smoother than other leading brands. Your only as good as your tools.
0,very nice smallest size is a bit to tiny to work with but the rest are fine...........promptly shipped...seller highly recommended
0,gorgeous colors, received quick!
0,One of my favorite dry adhesive trip runners, it glides easily and works so much better than my other expensive ones because it glides so easily.
0,perfect for use with loofah discs, easy clean up
0,The service was fast and the yarn was just what I needed.
0,I love it!
0,Use to re-sticky CRICUT mats. Works pretty good!
0,Just a touch of shimmer and I love it
0,nice
0,love it

0,I love this paper!  I have never used any kind of tracing paper for sewing and am so happy I started with this!  I thought I was going to need a special pencil and maybe a tracing wheel to learn to trace a pattern.  Using this I really needed nothing I couldn't find around the house.  I tried a #2 pencil, which worked great.  I tried using its eraser and it just smeared.  Then I tried one of my fine tip markers.  This worked great!  I used it to make 5 sizes of a dress pattern I bought for 3 of my granddaughters.  I just worked carefully, since I knew only white out would fix mistakes.  This marker, an 05 Zig Memory System, pigment ink, acid free, water & fade proof, lightfast, archival quality, non-bleeding marker is now my favorite thing to use for tracing on my Swedish Tracing paper.  It didn't smear or bleed through, and smoothly moved over the slight texture of this paper.  I received my paper on Saturday and by Sunday afternoon I had used the entire roll.  I am absolutely buying more.  Probabky two at a time now!
0,This is a great quality patch and is exactly as it's represented here in the photo. The material is heavyweight and the stitching is solid, no gaps or pulled strings.
0,This is great for fall and thanksgiving cards.  Can do a lot of different techniques with this embossing folder
0,I can't believe I've never had these till now. I really like them. I use these in conjunction with some Japanese watercolor markers that I bought as well as markers. I've yet to use them with my acrylics but that's next. The tips are flexible  and come in 3 different sizes. The best part is the ability to control the amount of water that comes out by squeezing the body of the brush. These are perfect for fine details, soft watercolor effects, big or small projects.
0,Bought clear and red to decorate rose bouquets  for wedding and for the boutineers. Worked well and highly recommend fort this use.
0,This was my first time to use polymer clay.  I made some miniature boats for a tiny diorama.  Easy to use, easy to bake.
0,Excellent product for a good price.
0,im very pleased with this item, I got it mainly to add frisket to my watercolors but as I use it I can see it will come in handy for other projects too. it appears to be made well, though yes, (like someone else mentions) it is just a piece of wood with a plastic handle around it. im happy I purchased this little tool.
0,As always graphic 45 is top of the line.  Quick delivery
0,Very happy with the gel pens thank you so much. Karen Greenlee
0,Pretty yarn for a great price.
0,Love the card die set.  I'm a card designer and when I want a quick card, this is what I pull out and it makes my cards look like I spent hours on them.
0,Cool ruler!!
0,Very good and a sample of all types.
0,Makes a nice card
0,I used one of the sizes yesterday for a fun fir project. The needles are smooth, but not too slippery. I'm happy with the purchase.
0,I am wondering if these will work with my Brother Innovis 2800D machine? I buy the pre-wound in the 10 pack right now but would order these if they work with my machine.
0,Love this product !!
0,Good student quality for a beginner and nice size for travel or plein air painting.
0,Exactly as expected.
0,This was a gift
0,Colors are great - paint covers well. Didn't realize the jars were so tiny
0,Love the storage.
0,Love this product. Made with tubular steel and solid particle board. It is easy to put together and the drawing  board tilts nicely. Could use more storage and I use a chair instead of the stool for more back support. For the price, you can't beat it.
0,Love these tiny strong clips. I hardly ever use pins anymore. They hold very tight, yet, with arthritis in hands and wrists, they are easy for me to use. Will buy another set of 100, cause you can use them to hold so many different things.
0,Works.
0,Great pieces to add charms or pendants to.
0,beautiful full rolls of vinyl just as described , will be my go to for all my vinyl.
0,I love this!!  The timer is really helpful too.  Glad this came with teflon sheet as well.  Very pleased with this product.
0,These are exactly what I wanted.. Very pleased with this purchase!
0,These are a great charm bead.  They are a very nice looking charm bead.  Work very well in my craft project.  Would recommand them.
0,great little machine - and fast service
0,I purchased this to replace my old machine that I wore out.  So far it works well and I like it.  I have not had much time using it, yet, so we shall see how it holds up.  I do a lot of quilting and have not yet tried to machine quilt with it.  Will add to review once I have done that.
0,These are beautiful dies-but I find I have to turn and run them thru twice to cut completely through all areas. Will need to have patience for popping out all the holes with a paper piercer that is unless you have the Spellbinders Tool -in-one that really helps with separating the cut out from the dies. They add that extra touch of beauty to your projects
0,I wanted to locate a lighter weight, cheaper watercolor paper to use for color charts and just for testing colors and blends without wasting higher cost, thicker paper. This really fits the bill and actually it's very nice paper. If you are willing to put in the extra effort to stretch it, it would also be perfect for finished works. I don't like to bother with that most of the time so I use heavier paper for that convenience, but I know the frugal crafter has a utube video on how to stretch this weight of paper. Something I may give a try in the future!
0,I hate my thread unraveling.  These will help a lot and keep my from going crazy.
0,Nice designs,wish it was a little deeper, particularly the longest piece. A bit too shallow.
0,Item As Described
0,It was hard to get used to these water brushes at first, but after using them more and more, they're perfect for watercolour sketches on the go and it motivates you to paint more because of the convenience. Great product!
0,I love these Gel Pens.  I will be ordering them again.
0,Needed
0,These hooks are good hooks. While I prefer the smooth gliding from the metal hooks,  these are great. I love the the light on the end. It makes crocheting with dark yarn a lot easier with less eye strain. The handle is good and easy to hold. They are a great investment. I just started using them so I don't know how long the battery lasts. The sizes are a little bigger, so if you are using a J hook and you start using these in the middle of a project, you will need to use the I needle to get the same size stitches. The set came packaged together but no case.		Pros - these crochet hooks are very light, like a feather.	The light is very helpful with dark yarn.	Less eye strain.	Easy to hold handles.		Cons - the throat on these hooks are not very deep, so your yarn does not stay on the hook as well as deep throated hooks.	You have to purchase a case if you want to keep your hooks in one, since they do not come with one.	Sometimes the switch is hard to turn on/off.		Would I purchase again? Yes I would.		Would I recommend these hooks to a friend? Yes I would.		Overall these are a good investment, but a little pricey.
0,This paper is good quality and I will use it for many projects I have in mind.  Arrive on time with no damage.
0,Love this guage! Works for needles and hooks, quick and easy check.
0,No problems
0,Vibrant color and good quality thickness.
0,Perfect!  They are great craft items for whatever you use them for.
0,They seem ok. Blades are a little flimsy, two of them arrived slightly bent on the tip.
0,Purchased this for my daughter, who is an avid photographer,for storage of her photos. These boxes seem to work great for what she wanted, as well as, being acid free. Received them quickly thanks to Amazon and their supplier. Great job as usual!
0,as advertised
0,Absolutely fantastic!!!!!  Just exactly what I needed and will be ordering more! A really nice variety of sizes and speedy shipping.  I could not be happier!!!!!
0,NICE
0,Good quality needles
0,Just what I wanted
0,Just starting to work with these pigments
0,Good seller and product.
0,These ribbons are adorable. Making bracelets with them and get complimented all the time about the designs. would buy again
0,This is a great little storage tin for any of the cube sized inks.  There is enough room to also store a blending foam under each color.
0,very pretty..
0,This carrying case is a super complement to the new Singer sewing machine I got my wife for Christmas.
0,Forget Copic pens.  These are a great alternative.
0,worked for what I needed
0,Great
0,when I got this, one or two of the hairs were sticking out and messing up my inking. I clipped the hairs and now the brush works like a charm. A great size for comic artists, its line varies from super-thin to nice and chunky.
0,Great yarn for making blankets.
0,Red Heart is an excellent brand ... have always used it.
0,The spacer's are of great quality and bright colors.  I love them.
0,Fast Delivery, good quality, who could ask for more.
0,Thank you very much, you have reached the order and I am really happy
0,Love this little gadget.  Prefer this one to other versions of this product.
0,Update: November 2014. This tool is fabulous, sturdy, fit for purpose and works extremely well.  I've used it several times now and keep it close when cardmaking.  Usually I use it when making a card which is a custom size or just a bit too thick to fit into a store-bough envelope.  Gosh it works well and is easy to use!  Somehow I thought there would be a learning curve but I relalize now I awfulized yet another triviality.  WeRMemory Keepers is a great company for providing well designed products and tools at good price points to fit specific needs.  I never worry when I buy from them and have NEVER been disappointed in their products or their design.		It is really not fair to write a review based on other's reviews but I simply haven't had the opportunity to use this tool yet and want to get up to date on my Amazon reviews.  Please read others comments for specifics and far more helpful comments than I can presently offer.  We R Memory Keepers never disappoint me.
0,I only use Oracal vinyl after trying several different types.	Super easy to weed and work with.
0,Just received it! Brand new in box. The unit is shiny! Can't wait to get it home and hook it up, see how it works. From the few negative comments, it sounds like people have been over-tightening, or forgetting to seal the threads with teflon tape, so that's on the to-do for assembly.	I'll update this once I have it up and running.	I'll be using this for painting miniatures, at first basecoating and terrain, then larger surface areas of models, and maybe eventually detail work.		Update:  this is n excellent compressor.  The tank is 2-3 liters, more than enough for my purposes.  No leaks, and it came with a roll of teflon tape.  Yes, the regulator/water trap is upside down if you screw it on all the way, but if u can do that ur not using the tape correctly.  The thing is quiet too, only 47-48 decibels, about the same noise as a forced air furnace kicked on.  You can easily have conversations while this is on.
0,I will likely order more!
0,Excellent.
0,First of Caran D'ache did a great job on picking the colors to include in this set, you get all the primary colors and a few unique and beautiful brights.  This set can be a tester set to see if you want to spend the money on a bigger set but with this array of colors I would be happy to call this a stand alone set.  So many smaller sets don't have wide enough range of colors (polychromos 24 set I'm talking to you). The pencils are a very nice to look at pencil with the fully lacquered body and gold writing. The lightfast rating is printed on the body of the pencil. The colors although they are usually referred to as a hard pencil the colors go down really smooth and the pencil keeps a good point. The down side of these pencils for me is that I had a harder than usual time blending the colors together but that may be because I am used to Prismacolor pencils. Also the color I would think of as pink they have identified as purple.
0,Good ruler.
0,Great for saving the top of my craft table from markers, glue, etc and is easy to wipe off.
0,good
0,Great quality and detail.  Cant believe how low cost they are.  Very thick so they pop up on my cards.  Love them and are buying more and other products they make.
0,Big sized, these were perfect for homemade peanut butter cups.
0,Really pretty Christmas Papers - perfect for mini albums, and all of the patterns coordinate beautifully.
0,my only complaint is i wish there were more faces (more POC) instead of all the clock emojis and random stuff that i will probably ever use. does anyone use the bamboo emoji? no.
0,Great addition to the flower maker.
0,Love the stencil. You can make great designs with it
0,Just what I needed for a craft project.  Great for writing and coloring.
0,Use these for book binding my signatures and attaching to spine. Use three strands and holds nicely and match colors to covers!!! Recommend
0,Great size!
0,superb price on this - and very fast shipping
0,Good for my stash
1,The needles are roughly textured. Will keep only because my old Chibi container broke. Trashed the needles.
1,I think this is the most useless thing I've ever bought on Amazon. I couldn't even use it, it's so flimsy. Just wind them  by hand, it'll take you way less time and effort, trust me!
1,This product was covered in dirt when I got it. My son and I were stunned. Also the drawers showed that they held pens and they DO NOT hold a standard pen. The drawers are all 1/2 to 1 inch to shallow. I bought this to organize my gel pens and markers and none fit :(
1,I returned it because the skeins were way too small and the yarn weight was too light for what I wanted if for.  It is more like twine.
1,Did I get a defective one? Cause my needles broke after two uses...I didn't even use a lot of pressure...pen is fine but the needles are Garbage
1,The idea behind this tool is sound, the execution of this particular model is not.  Emphasis should be placed on the brush head, making it more effective that it is.  Granted, all dies and paper are not alike but this brush wasn't as effective ejecting small die cut bits as the kitchen bottle brush I previously used.	The tools that come with the brush handle are throwaways in my opinion.  I had to watch a YouTube demo to figure out what the flat piece was for and the piercer setup is unwieldy and uncomfortable to use with the brush weighing down the other end.	The utility and ergonomic score of Spellbinders brush tool rate a 2 on a good day.
1,This would be perfect except the hairs come out of it every time I use it.  I start with excess lint in my machine and end up with fine hairs instead.  Too bad because the handle is perfect and the shape of the brush would be perfect too...I would not but this again.
1,Don't waste your money unless you are positive this is what you need.  And if you get some answers, you have been luckier than I have been.
1,The Zinc and the Nickel are the same product with different prices. I could have just bought the lesser expensive but they charged 3.00 more for the same thing.
1,The colors are pretty, but the base fabric is of very low quality and is not a true batik, as made in Indonesia, but a knockoff from India.  I will not use these in a sewing project.
1,First, the bottle will not stay on - it needs some kind of screw or clasp.  It falls off and then spills the contents.  But that is minor compared the the fact that almost nothing comes out of the air brush, even at 50 psi.  Acts like it is clogged, but it is brand new.  Occassionally something will spray out for a second or two, then just stops.  Water will not even spray.  This is a very very poor product.
1,Did not take long to brake.
1,This is not a mirror!  Does not give a good reflection of your fussy cut or quilt piece.  Do not buy!
1,These pop dots do not separate from the backing very well. Also, the square of paper you remove to expose the sticky part sticks to your fingers. You have to flick them off which means they go flying everywhere. I have had the Michaels brand of pop dots in the past. They were great. I won't be buying this brand again.
1,Magnet is very weak and not perfectly flat and wiggles on sewing machine; quality is not good and somewhat useless designed item.
1,tangle alot
1,This is very cheap quality DAISO product ( a dollar store ). Very thin.
1,This clay was good but it tended to dry out quickly.
1,Very unhappy with the seller, which is Lion Brand Yarns - the color was very different online versus in person, and they don't describe the colors at all, so you have to go by the photo.  I ordered the Arcadia, and it looks like greens and browns.  In reality, it is mostly a maroon color with a little green and a little brown.  And guess what!  NO RETURNS.  On 8 unopened, brand new skeins of yearn.  Way to go, Lion.  Won't be a returning customer.
1,These ere very cheap. I bought a few packs for an event. Non of them lasted the whole 4 days. They kept breaking and unhinging. It was a nightmare.
1,Pretty color but both items had horrible tangles. Tossed away.
1,hard to get colors on the brush, no matter how much moisture you drip onto the color before using the brush.  Paint is grainy and  difficult to get any color saturation.  Many shades are so closely related in hue IRL that they are indistinguishable.
1,It says "WHITE" on the UPC label.  I peeled the UPC label off; and, under that label states: "NATURAL"; so, the product is a natural color that is labeled as white.  The natural color is grey.  Some people may like grey; so, why the mislabeling?  The attached photo says it all.
1,Worked well for the first couple weeks then compressor went out
1,I am returning because I had numerous thread breakages on the first stitch out. When the thread breaks it shreads. The thread also catches on the bottom of the spool, which leads to the thread breaking if you aren't watching and don't catch it.		It started to stitch at the top of the C. After the 1st thread breakage the loops of the C were too loose, so I had to adjust my thread tension up from 2.8 to 3.2 and that helped some. If you notice at one point only the bobbin thread was stitched, because the top thread was caught on the bottom of the spool. It didnt't break, but I had to watch the thread unwind and give it a little bump when it caught.		I will have to stitch the design again with different brand thread to see if it would work. I wanted to love this thread, but it didn't work out for me. Thankfully, this is my test towel and not my real project.		Thread color #510D Dk Bubblegum		I am using a Singer Legacy SE340
1,I was happy to find a set of markers with such a large selection of colors and was looking forward to working with these.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed right from the start.  When filling in larger spaces I found that the markers left behind streaks and mottled areas.  It was a little better after they dried...but then I discovered tiny white areas had appeared here and there. On some of the colors the tips began to fray almost immediately.		I've had none of these problems with either Sharpie or Bic, and they're considerably less expensive.  I won't be purchasing these again. Do yourself a favor - don't waste your money; stick with Sharpie or Bic. They may not offer as many colors (yet), but you'll get good coverage, the ink dries evenly and without streaks, and I've never had a problem with white spots.
1,These pages stick together and are flimsy..not of good wuality like some others I have purchased. I do not want to order this brand again
1,Heat and Bond Lite is very similar and much easier to handle.  I used it on some applique and it was too sheer and hard to manipulate.
1,These arrived with many beads missing.  The envelope had no padding and the plastic pouch inside was torn and smaller beads missing.  Very disappointing.	Color was NOT at all like photo.  Nothing vibrant about the colors.  Not recommended at all.
1,Never could get any sparkly out of this.  Not happy at all.  Wasted my bucks!
1,Pretty but difficult to remove even with the special remover tool you can buy.
1,I'm fairly new at embossing and really enjoy doing it on my tags / bookmarks, BUT, this gold has glitter mixed in and it does not adhere well for my purposes.  It is a wasted purchase for me, not enough substance to melt, the glitter dust just brushes or rubs off after heating.
1,Threadart (seller): you really need to redo your measurements & fix the item description/photo. This review is for the 120 spool rack, now the listing is only showing the 60 spool rack. When it was the 120 spool rack, it also showed a photo of many 1100 yard spools on the rack, all fit nicely side by side, bottoms not overlapping. So I took a chance on ordering this. My review: minus one star for wrong measurements, minus one star because you say it will fit the 1100 yard mini king spools, minus one star for sloppy workmanship. The item stated "...15" x 24", with 1.5" between wood dowels". My rack is 15.5" by 26.25", with no more than 15.38" between dowels, most having only 1.25" between. Granted each thread manufacturer has small differences in the size of their plastic bottoms for the 1100 yard spools, but since I've tried 3 different brands & none of them can stand side by side on your thread rack... your rack is not made adequately spaced to hold these. The wood dowels are not all installed straight, & this rack cannot stand away from the wall due to one leg being a little shorter than the other. So it must lean against the wall. I'll add my voice to many other reviews: please remake this to incorporate a way to hang it, while I can figure out a way to do this it would be ever so much easier if you included a crossbar at the top from which to nail or screw this in. Even a set of triangular metal picture hangers on the back at the top of the vertical bracings would be an improvement. I am keeping this, see my photo on how to solve the thread storage problem: alternate the threads right side up & upside down. Not as pretty as all right side up, but it works.
1,basically seems like black. not a dark brown.
1,too difficult to put on and they stick out, too obvious
1,it doesnt cut through the cardstock/paper all the way. the bow on top works great, but not the wreath, and i have tried it in my cuttlebug, and big shot
1,The cover is flimsy, it doesn't lay flat when open, the paper is really weird.  It's true the marker does not bleed through the back but my art supplies look really strange on this paper.  They are all very muted.  The Copic markers have a mottled dingy look.  Not at all what I expected.  I have it to my children to color in.  I would not recommend.
1,This comes up when searching for glow in the dark but doesn't glow at all
1,I ordered 2 of these. 1 of them came ripped. The big window showing the paints is ripped from the middle to the sides. The rips are very obvious.  So the product is useless as a gift. Very upsetting.
1,Weak and doesn't hold up very well for machine quilting. The thread would fray and agree in the machine and its very frustrating.
1,Should of read description better thought they were larger squares
1,It seems like it's made well. It's very sturdy and looks nice, but the blade seems to be really lacking in the sharpness department.		It will cut right through the leather if held vertically pushing downright, but it doesn't seem to be sharp enough to thin the edges of the leather like it shows in the description picture. I tried on several pieces of leather thinking it was just the kind I was using but in all of them, it just skipped and gouged my edges.		Maybe with a nice session on a knife sharpener it will preform better, but over all, it only does half of what I need it to.
1,not as I expected, not good coverage
1,Whoever wrote this product description wrote: "Here, you get 12 packages, each containing 1- 5-1/2 by 9-inch sheet of stickers."  It clearly states that it includes 12 sheets but it only contains one.  I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this project.  Waste of money.
1,Burns too fast and too big of a flame
1,The scrape pieces were all to small for me to really use then with anything,.
1,Not as expected.
1,I absolutely love else success punches!!!! They are study and weighted making it easy to punch through think her materials. This circle punch cuts with percision making layering even easier! Love my purchase		Update!!!! After a month and only using it maybe a dozen times the punch no longer works :( super frustrating considering they should last a really long time
1,These took about 3 months to be shipped from China.  When I did receive them and tried to use them they just snapped into pieces.  They are very brittle.  You get what you pay for.  I spent a couple dollars more and purchased a higher quality at my local craft store.
1,While I love the color on the container, it is not even close to the color of the stamp pad.  Gold is not putty, sadly...
1,The campaign for safe cosmetics published a study in 2009 on lead, nickel, cobalt and chromium in childrens' facepaint kits. You can easily google it and find it. They report Snazaroo's had the highest lead content of the 10 facepaint kits they tested, 0.56 parts per million (page 8 of their report). This is 5.6 times higher than the maximum amount of lead allowed in candy, 0.10 parts per million, and almost 40 times the maximum allowed in water, 0.015 ppm (pl. 13).
1,Unable to use with my heavy bodied acrylic paint.
1,NOT like washi tape! Poor quality. Very stiff and doesn't stick well. I won't be using it. :(
1,It tore the hell out of my shirt when I tried it.  I was promptly issued a refund but this didn't come complete, it did not have the brush (?) and what I presume is oil.  Not sure but I returned it immediately.
1,This machine is a piece of crap. The thread didn't wind evenly , which will then cause all kinds of problems while sewing. It was very cheaply made and I returned it. Don't waste your money.
1,tiny pieces they don't put the size measurements on the description to fool you don't waste your money like i did
1,I am really disappointed in this beveler. The blade is not sharp. As I lack the skills to sharpen one, this early in my leather hobby, I am very displeased to have wasted the money on it.
1,I returned it. It did seem well made,  very heavy duty but it rusted after one use.
1,These blade cut great . Once . Then they need to be changed , and that is a challage not to cut your fingers off .
1,Many of the feathers were really really small. I actually started counting them because the bag was so small when they came that I didn't believe it held 100 feathers. I finally quit because they were too small to deal with. It was OK, but not what I had expected, too small!
1,So small!!
1,Just ok like most bobbin.
1,this stuff seems to never dry and I do not recommend it for art that needs to not be sticky. It stays sticky unless you use it on the back of something totally covered.
1,This was one of my first paint sets and everything went wrong.  First and most important is none of the paint numbers matched.  Also not enough paint to complete.  Thats my own opinion.
1,This stencil does not come in a package, it was just shoved into the box. It is really bent and not usable.
1,Very low loft.  I was not impressed and will not be purchasing again.
1,I am a fairly experienced header and buy at a bead shop. I wanted a beading starter kit for my granddaughter. I was appalled that these beads were not in a plastic organizer as the picture would lead you to believe. Everything was separated by small plastic bags and wrapped in a larger one. Not enough wire. Some pieces are not useful for beginners. Too much money for so little.
1,These are the worst! You would have to be a body builder in order to open and close these shears. I have tried loosening the screw devise, spraying with WD-40 and nothing works to try and make these shears easier to use.
1,I purchased this machine on Amazon through FlexShopper.  What a nightmare!  I've been sewing for 30 years and I've never seen so many problems after only a few weeks of using a machine.  Light weight fabrics get sucked into the feed dogs, no matter how much you adjust the pressure. The tension is moody and hard to manage.  The LCD display is a joke as the image quality is very poor. The needle threader jammed into the downward position and even though I managed to push it back up, now the machine will not sew because the needle threader catches on the back of shank as it tries to move.  I had to send the machine off for warranty repair.  Beware, if you don't have an authorized Brother Dealership or Service near you, Brother requires you to pay to ship the machine off for repairs! What a joke!  With 7.5" of throat space, an additional LED light wouldn't have been to much to ask.  My former machine, the Singer Quantum Stylist 9960 has an additional light in the throat area, comes with 18 bonus presser feet, has a much better LCD screen, an extra wide extension table included, does a much better job when free motion quilting with automatic tension, and costs $50.00 less.  If you want an extension table for the PC-420PRW, you'll pay $50+...I'm done with Brother!  I bought the new Juki DX7 and it is a stunning machine!  Yes, it's pricey but you get what you pay for.  I also sold my Brother serger and replaced that with Juki as well.  Juki machines are the most amazing machines I've ever used and don't cost $5,000 for a decent model like Brother's VQ3000 machine which is no better than my new Juki DX7 I just paid $1300 for, minus some high tech bells and whistles that the more practical among us don't even need.  My advice is to either finance or save up for a good machine.  There's nothing worse than playing musical sewing machines!  I'm so glad I finally have good machines I know I can count on for years to come.  Thanks to the helpful folks at Sewing Machines Plus, I'm back on track and ready for a fun new year!  :)
1,Had trouble figuring ot how to keep it on. Kept falling off. Needed directions with foot.
1,Unfortunately I had to return these square bezel trays and cabs.  A few of the trays could not be used because there were noticeable lumps, so I could not sell or gift them.  Also, there are two different styles of trays, so if you order these be aware of that.
1,I have found that the Sewing Machine Needle threading tool just doesn't work. I read the instructions and carefully followed them but ended up threading my need the old fashion way.  Waste of money.
1,These markers were disappointing. The fine tip point on most of them was dried out and wouldn't hardly wright.  And the brush tips on several didn't hold it shape after the first one or two strokes.  I didn't expect fantastic markers for the amount of money spent however I do expect them to at least work.
1,Very slow muscle memory of opening from closed position. Poor grade steel I suppose.  Feels like they would not last long.  Famore brand FAR superior and less expensive!!!  Famore will also resharpen for free.  Gladly RETURNED these !  Will buy more Famore.
1,Over priced for product
1,I was knitting a blanket in the round, it didn't even get to lap size before the size 5 needle just snapped at the threading, lost a bunch of my stitches. I'm not an "aggressive" knitter and I've never broken interchangeable needles before. It was extremely frustrating, I don't trust the rest of the set now and the size 5 is my favorite anyway.
1,Update: It dried out way too quickly, so I'm changing my rating from 3 stars to 1 star...	Original review: It's a "fine point", yes. But instead of being fine and soft it is fine and hard, like a ballpen, and as a results it barely leaves any mark. You have to press really hard for any ink to come out at all, and if you are marking fabric on a soft surface, then it's impossible to get any ink trace with this pen at all. I'm deeply disappointed.
1,I received size 13 instead.
1,hard to fill the container - needs to come with a funnel of some sort
1,Broke under light tension and with light knotting. I do like the look of the cord if you don't need to work with it very much it might be right for you. 2 stars.
1,uncomfortable. Falls off. pinches finger! I would rather wrap a string around my ring 40 times to make it fit rather than wear one of these. I returned it 2 days later.
1,No stars. Item NOT as described. This is for one not a case of 10
1,Yuck
1,This gauge doesn't really help me much with confirming crochet hook size because most of the hooks I own and use don't fit through the holes. I've listed the types of hooks I own below and indicated whether or not I can check them using this gauge.		DO FIT:	Susan Bates hooks (Silvalume and Bamboo handle)	Clover Amour hooks (ergonomic)		DON'T FIT:	Tulip Etimo (ergonomic)	Boye (aluminum)	Knitter's Pride Waves (ergonomic)	Curtzy (aluminum)	EpicBelle (ergonomic)	Clover Soft Touch (ergonomic)		I don't plan on making the effort to return this item because it would be more of a hassle to send it back than to keep it. For other potential buyers looking to check the size of their crochet hooks, though, I highly recommend purchasing a different gauge.
1,Not even close to this picture. I received some chalky old pink beads in a dirty little used plastic bag. Returning.
1,Ribbon is more soft lemon than ivory and a little bit larger than 5/8 of inch
1,Just received the package. I thought the yarn should be new, with the paper band on. And I ordered 2 items.
1,Arrived bent.  Gauge will not stay in position without slipping.  Very frustrating trying to measure 108 drapery hems. Will look for different brand.
1,Paint cracks, have removed and reapplied several times, won't purchase again.
1,Way to expensive for a tiny case. I must have missed the size when I read about it. Made well but mini.
1,This is a very nice looking addition to my desk. The problem I have with it is that the bottom rotating piece is nearly impossible to attach. It is clear that the diameter was inaccurately cut. We had to use our Pedi Paws rotating sander to file around the edge to make it fit. Even after sanding, it was hard to pop it into place.	Two stars only because it looks nice.
1,cracks like crazy. will not be ordering this again.
1,small in portion and size
1,junk
1,A General Review ... There are several things I want to mention... It took a VERY VERY VERY long time to come in... Ridiculous amount of time.	The container was loose in a bubble envelope put in my mailbox... Which is another new thing for Amazon as well.  When I opened the metal container, the product was Cracked. Which it really should not be. (Ordered before, no reason for cracking).  I suppose there are no standards as to how these products are to be sold and shipped.	First, this should be put in Ziplock Plastic,  as this stuff is Stinky like Shoe Polish, and MAY melt in the sun... Unlikely, but Ziplock= No Brainer... Second, Oh My God... Wrap it in another piece of  bubble wrap plastic please?  NOW I SEE WHY IT WAS THE PRICE IT WAS... BUT I PAID FOR SHIPPING, didn't  I ?	And on Shipping Comments, AMAZON... Are you TRYING to GET RETURNS ??? You are asking about your "Packaging" with Shipping and doing Nothing About it  !!!  DUDES, SHIP ACCORDINGLY !!! Take notes from other companies if you need to...		On The COLOR, "GERMAN SILVER" :  It  should Really be called "Champagne Metallic" , or  "Warm Silver".  People who do not know will not be thrilled. THIS COLOR IS AN  IN -BETWEEN GOLD AND SILVER...	"GILDERS PASTE"  itself is a GREAT PRODUCT,  This is now being used in conjunction with some other surface treatments such as Christi Friesen's  " Swellegant "  Line.  People are now turning away from the less sophisticated paint derived surface treatments and now using real Patinas and Oxides.	These small issues needed to be addressed. I hope this tiny frustration was helpful to Someone.	Your time is precious,  demand the best, use the best you can..
1,I am new at rotary cutting so decided to buy this product to help me do a better job of cutting for my second quilt. I didn't notice any change - still slippery - moved while cutting. I am aware that as a new quilter I probably need more practice rotary cutting.
1,These needles are poor quality. I broke 6 of them sewing one leather pouch. I'm actually surprised how bad they were since Tandy is usually a good brand.  I'm super disappointed.
1,This stuff is horrible. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I run a successful etsy shop and needed purple in a pinch. My silhouette couldn't even cut this. It peeled off in one piece. I
1,No fine point. Don't waste your money.
1,IN YOUR PAINTING...its a mess.  Painting along and you see these hairs all over affecting the look and you try to get them out without damaging everything. Yuck.
1,I didn't use right away. So I couldn't return. Almost broke my brother se400.
1,This die is beautiful in this minature photo, but the actual die cut out is not what I was expecting. The ivy leaves and pincone were too unusually shaped. Forgive me Tim Holtz, because I love most of your work.
1,The magnetic sheets do not hold the thinlit dies in place! They fall off as soon as you try to turn he page.
1,Bought this for my 9 year old grandson. Returned it as it was way to complex. They did not imprint the figure on the mat
1,i don't think i've ever written a negative review on something purchased on Amazon.  I've had my Gingher scissors about 3 1/2 years.  I used them for applique for one project about 2 years ago.  They have been stored in my studio far away from water.  When I pulled them out for another applique project this morning, I found that the blades had rusted. I was stunted.  I've had them too long to be able to return them.  My loss.
1,I make a lot of thank you cards for gifts that I receive and I was excited to buy this punch. I have quite a few of the Martha Stewart punches and I like them just fine. This one does not punch like the others. I don't know if I can explain this properly, but the other punches have the shape of the punch that it punches thru. For example, the flower punch, it has the metal piece that punches the paper and a flower shaped hole for the metal flower to go all the way thru. The "thank you" punch does not have the hole in the bottom, it is just a flat piece of metal. So it would be like you have a metal shape and you press it on the table.		The "thank you" punch does punch out the words and the flower, but it isn't clean, I used cardstock. You also have to use a lot of force to punch the words, and once you punch the words, the punch messes up the outer paper, so you can't use the negative part for anything. If you don't punch it enough, which you won't know unless you take the paper out and by then you have ruined the whole area where it was punching because it will punch the outer part of the "thank you".		This punch will do the job, but there has to be a better punch out there. I was going to buy the "happy birthday" punch, but I won't now. I think for now, I will just stick to my cricut.
1,personally, I thought it was a total waste of $$
1,Great shape but I found the force you need to apply to cut the shape from your paper troublesome. I would recommend trying a more ergonomic and better made model
1,Horribly toxic stuff.  Received as gift.  Didn't work very well in any case.  When my toddler figured out how to get in our art cabinet he took a bite.  I then realized it does not say non-toxic on package.  No information on the Pentel website product page.  I looked up the Material Safety Data Sheet which said: "Small amounts swallowed are not harmful. Get medical attention if large amounts swallowed."  Then I read the ingredients:  Paraffin 7-16%, Ethyl Acetate 8-10%, and DBP (dibutyl phthalate) 35-40%.  Horrifying!  I have worked hard to keep phthalates (typically in PVC products, fragrances, etc.) out of our house because they are carcinogenic, endocrine disrupting, and cause reproductive harm.  I had just been reading the European Union only allows phthalates in products at a concentration of 0.1%, and here this has 35-40%!  Wish the US regulations would protect our children!  Disgusting.
1,These pencils are very waxy.  They have a very crayon-like consistency.  When you attempt to layer, even on very toothy paper, they begin to blob and smear after a couple of layers from the incredible wax laydown. Any attempt at burnishing produces a very messy result.  The colors are nice, but I wouldn't recommend them.
1,Well, I should have known. I am a quilter, this is very thinly woven fabric, color selection is nice but fabric quality is very poor.
1,Ainda no recebi minha encomenda. ;(
1,No matter how many times they write the size is  "Medium 4" on the label, this is NOT Medium-4, it is a THREE!  Now, I'm stuck with three skeins of the wrong size of yarn and an unfinished project.  The color is perfect.
1,They are JUNK~ Some won't mare anything!  There aren't 120 different colors, many repeated
1,All of them are too big even after I put them in the microwave
1,I should've returned the brush when it arrived with a splayed tip.  I was ignorant and thought that it just needed a little conditioning and it would be fixable.  After 3 months of constantly trying to get the point to hold a shape, I've given up all hope.		I have some other W&N brushes that don't have this issue, so I guess I just got a lemon.  BE WARNED that quality control is extremely shoddy.  If your brush arrives looking like this, RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY!
1,very stiff
1,Pleased
1,I hate these pins as they are called quilting pins but they will not even thru the material without bending,,
1,I ordered 10 bags of these tiny mirrors. They were terribly packed for a shipment, 3 plastic bags had the bottom completely broken so the mirrors were loose in the box, and 1 bag was broken in half. Some mirrors broke, I cut a finger, and some got spoiled with lines and stripes. I received 8 less pieces than I should've. I'm really disapointed, but this is what you get for that low price offer. If you are looking for nice tiny mirrors, don't buy these ones, spend a little more money and buy a good product, because this one is terrible.
1,The actually size is 3.4 W by 3.4 H....so it's smaller than stated in its description. I took a pic of it next to a quarter. It doesn't cut that well and it's a pain poking out all the tiny holes. I should have saved my money and bought the tim holtz one.
1,Not what I wanted for my pyrography
1,it doesn't say anywhere on the description that the bonding is non-permanent as written on the packaging, that should be known before buying
1,This is my second review of these markers. After trying them briefly I thought they were fine. Well, this is not the case. They are dried out!!! It took over a month for delivery & they weren't cheap! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! They are garbage!
1,After cutting a design out it falls off the backing. It's not strong enough to hold the vinyl to flip it over to iron on. I wasted a whole sheet trying to get it to stay on long enough to lay on the shirt and press. Will not buy again.
1,If you're looking for washi tape keep looking. This stuff is shiny, opaque, and sticks only moderately well. I kept it because the patterns are cute, but I don't know what I'll use it for yet. I'm sure I'll find something. Maybe to embellish cards, I can't see it sticking to anything other than paper.
1,It really took a long time to get here. Found what we needed at a local store to complete the project.
1,I bought a second three pack of this blender and I don't know why I did.  I guess it is the price.  But these blenders last about as long as a q-tip dipped in alcohol.  I won't buy them again.  In the picture - far left blender has not been used.  Middle one has been used on 1 1/2 pictures in SOME areas - not even the whole picture and the one to the far right is shot - and it was used on 3 pictures.
1,I was extremely disappointed to find that the kit has a WHITE stocking back for a GREEN stocking front! Unfortunately I didn't realize it until I had sewn on all the applicues to the front or I would have gone out and bought enough to green felt to do the front and back. I have been unable to match the shade of green felt to the stocking front anywhere! So I wrote to the company Plaid Crafts asking if I could purchase additional green felt from them and they replied:		"Unfortunately, we cannot alter the kit as designed.  We do not sell felt separately from the kit."		I find it very hard to believe that others haven't needed additional fabric to replace goofs in the past and can't believe they couldn't provide this. Plus the sequins are much lower quality than those in kits I did in the 80's. I will definitely look for better quality kits for other grandchildren's stockings.
1,These were supposed to be 200 yards, they are only 5 feet long
1,I bought it expressly to cut fun foam for a church project and it would not work. No matter what pressure, depth or material -- we ended up cutting 130 Chrismons Ornaments out by hand. So much for bragging about my Scan n Cut 2.
1,This will not work with a top mount bobbin. Even though I cut around it the plastic bubbles into the way. Mine went straight to the trash can. Not worth the cost of returning
1,not bright enough to see yet too much opacity to see the fabric edge through - it actually made cutting more difficult for me. Useless stuff for quilting - maybe the preschool grands can use it for crafts?
1,Disappointed in the flimsy plastic and size. Should have checked it out at my local fabric store.
1,Smaller then I thought, would not buy again
1,I needed a new zipper foot for my brother sewing machine. This did not fit the machine. The brother brand was listed but I failed to see that it said serger foot. I ended up calling Brother and ordering a foot from them. I have learned my lesson. Really read each description before you buy
1,Little tricky to use. Not what I was hoping for. It is hard to open the rings because of the thickness of the rings I use. I still need to use pliers. I might give it to my sister who uses lighter weight rings.
1,Received on time but was rolled so I had to flatten it out for five days before I could use it. When I was finally able to use it, it was not 12 x12 like it said, but was cut crooked at 11x12 so I had to adjust the size of my image to make it fit.
1,Maybe I'm just too impatient, but I can never seem to get it to preheat enough to be worth anything. Even after trying to fuse it on the fabric it seems like more gets stuck to my iron trying to preheat it than sticks to the fabric. Also - this will gum up your needle like no other. I much prefer Steam a Seam or Wonder Tape for my seams.
1,I've gone through two boxes of this brand and I end up with failed attempts every time. I've tried everything ever suggested and found online. I just can't get it to work.
1,Okay, this product is a joke.	Well, the product is fine in and of itself, but the PRICE for what you receive is an absolute joke.		The sellers should be ashamed of themselves.	I admit that I did not see the exact dimensions. I had read about these sheets over a year ago, and have wanted one for a very long time, as I like to free-motion quilt. I had previously noted that they came in regular size and queen size.  Silly me - I thought that meant a reasonably sized sheet (regular) versus a really large sheet (queen) that covered a larger area, perhaps your machine base and part of your table.		Wow - shocker.	When I finally had the money to be able to order one, I nabbed it from the link on my wish list.	When I got the package, and I thought there was just no way this could be correct.	It was thin as a sheet of paper - I had thought it would be folded, and you'd unfold it and lay it across your sewing machine.		People - save your money!!	This thing is a THIN little sheet, literally the size of a piece of typing paper.	That's it.	No unfolding. No real help.	There's a hole punched in it to allegedly go over where your particular machine's needle hits.	The tiny thin sheet has a tacky side that will supposedly hang on to your machine surface, and the top is	silicone to allow the fabric to glide more easily.		This might indeed be the case. The item probably is okay, even though many people have said you still need to tape it down to keep it from hanging, or it will tear. Here's the thing - I get it that it is a helpful item. But the PRICE versus what you RECEIVE is a real joke!	Sadly, I won't be returning it because (per Amazon) I have to use UPS to return it, and it would cost me an additional $6.95 to return this tiny little piece of slick paper. I can't just use regular postal mail.		SAVE YOUR MONEY.	There are other brands out there now that will give you a larger sheet for less money.	I truly wish I had done my usual research, instead of buying off my own wish list and leaning on rumors.	I'm somewhat new to quilting, and have often just bookmarked an item or brand that was recommended by another	more experienced sewer. Last time I will do that!	Shame on ME. I would think the manufacturers and sellers of this item would hang their heads in shame.		Seriously, buy a different brand. I have not felt this ripped off in a very, very long time.
1,These are quite cheap quality. One of them does not even align the punch mechanism enough to work. They are rickety, stiff and not sharp. They stick and get stuck. Compared to others I've used,these require way too much pressure for even a couple sheets. They are frustrating to use. I kept them because I use them seldom. If my hobbies ever require frequent use of hole punches, I will give these away and buy a quality set. I would never give these to my kids, if I could afford better ones. These are the kind of tools that fail to provide the kinesthetic pleasure that makes working with our hands far more rewarding than staring at a screen.
1,These come without directions!
1,I'm relatively new to quilting and bought this as my first rotary cutter. I will say it worked well at first and since I hadn't own a rotary cutter before, I thought highly of it. After less than a week of quilting and cutting fabric, boy did the blade dull quickly! It was so difficult cutting, I had to use my hands and knees to push down with my weight just to cut and even after cutting, I had to continuously go back to use my small scissors to cut the pieces that did not cut through. I only cut 1-2 layers and even with one layer, it did not cut through all the way. Quite annoying so after a week, I was determined to buy a new rotary cutter. I did my research and bought the Olfa Quick Change 45mm rotary cutter. Talk about a world difference my new Olfa rotary cutter made! Now I know the difference between a good and bad rotary cutter. The Olfa one literally glides across fabric(s) effortlessly compared to this one--even when it was at its best. Had I known how crappy and quickly this one would dull, I would not have bought it. I would not recommend this product if you're going to use it repeatedly.
1,Awful paper, not worth the money. Love cansons watercolor and mixed media, but this stuff is trash. Go for a good card or smthn, this paper is streaky, bad for blending and more. Bleh.
1,"20 per pack"	Wait was over a month, package was MASSIVE, contained ONE and ONLY ONE PLANK.
1,I wanted to give my daughter a latch kit like I use to play with as a child.  This set has a cute picture, but it is not printed on the mesh.  Instead they printed a grid on the mesh and provide a chart like you'd use in cross stitch.  My nine year old could easily follow it, but I think it would have been more fun for her if the image was printed.  Also, the yarn quality is very cheep and scratchy.  It does not resemble the soft plush kits I remember from childhood.  I think if it had a better tactile feel, my daughter would have enjoyed the kit more and we would have ended up purchasing more sets.  If this is the quality, than it really isn't worth the money or time.  Also, as noted in the description, it does not come with a hook so I purchased that separately.
1,This cloth is so far off grain, by the time I cut it even with the grain there wasn't much left.
1,It broke! It made it harder to thread the string because you thread the cod through the eyehole on this, and the that makes the cord "double-wide". The plastic is hard and rigid, and not at all flexible. I'll go back to the tried and true safety pin method.
1,I ordered black. Not black - charcoal. Either it's faded or just not dyed black enough.  I'll use it for dark grey needs only.
1,It worked quite nicely, however in less than a year the magnets  are popping out of the plate.
1,Hardly any color at all.
1,Very poor quality, not happy
1,ergonomic design doesn't perform the same as it promised,	1. hard plastic handle and sharp edges at where the fingers contact to when cutting stuff	2. the relative position of the two holes is bad. There is no way to put only three fingers in the larger hole to make cuttings, but there is no room for four fingers in the hole either.	3. it is very lightweight, but I have to use more energy to open this scissors		Pro:	1. lightweight	2. making crisp cutting edge on fabrics	3. inexpensive
1,I have spent hours the last few days winding bobbins with this thread. Only one in 20 comes out well and even then it only lasts for two stitch outs before running out. I thought I would save money making my own bobbins, but it has worked out far cheaper in time and broken needles etc to just buy prewound. I don't recommend.
1,Very disappointed with this order. These are not sterling silver as originally described.
1,These are not Bernina bobbins. The middle is smooth, no diamond pattern, there's a notch on top of spools which Bernina spools don't have. What they had pictures is not what was sent from China.  Had I of noticed they were from China I wouldn't of ordered them. I am please that my money was refunded without having to return bobbins, they went in the trash can.
1,Hard to control water. Leaks !
1,Love the color super thin vinyl so it's hard working with it!
1,I was given these, not thinking they'd be the best but expecting them to at least have some shimmering effect in which I could layer on top of my higher grade watercolors. No. You can barely even tell which color is which once put onto watercolor paper. There is no sparkling shimmering effect noticeable. The pans are very strange, and it is hard to even get these on your brush. And once on paper, they have no pigment.
1,2 of 4 corners on 2 of 4 boards arrived bent so these boards will be difficult to use.
1,I can't say that I blame anyone but myself for not knowing much about the beads. They are too small for my projects, I don't like the colors and I didn't count them but it sure didn't seem to be 50 beads in the bag but again because I have no use for them I haven't taken them out of the bag to count them.
1,They break so easily
1,I spent over an hour trying to make it fit my Viking 930.  It could not fit the two places.
1,I love the style and gave it an extra star for that but it destroys pencils. I'm an artist and my pencils are expensive. Warning do not purchase this. It is awful. If you have a small metal one without a reservoir it is a great one. Pick it up. Don't use this.
1,I think I have normal sized thumbs.....but these wouldn't fit by a long shot. However, they fit my 2.5 year old just fine.
1,I really wanted these dies, and LOVE Spellbinders and AMAZON! however, I am returning these unopened.  After I received them, I got to really look at them close up, and they are very small.  They are ok for a card front, however, they appeared to have roses around the edges, and larger lacey openings, in the description on the Amazon page there wasn't anything to tell me otherwise - and you cannot truly see the detail until these are in your hands.  I waited for these dies to become available in order to get them from Amazon, I was just really dissaspointed when I saw them in person, no roses, and the detail is so fine it most likely will not show up pronounced, even with an Embossing mat.  I also wish they were larger, as they appear in the picture, the actual open area to add your embellishments and sentiments is very small.  I still love my original Spellbinders dies, the card maker dies, the Nestabilities, just not in love with these.
1,Not what I needed.  Received refund quickly.
1,Save your money. Even if you can get the button on with this, takes practice,	they will not stay on. After 3 times on the same button, yes I found it 3 times,	I gave up!
1,Hate it.	This thing measures 16" by 16 1/2, if that's not idiotic I don't know what is. As far as I'm concerned that certainly makes it useless for making anything square.  Being a 1/2" off makes it much to difficult to use.  I can't imagine why it would be designed a half inch off.
1,This wire stretches a ridiculous amount when used to hang large wood signs. To compensate for the stretchiness, I tried attaching it lower on the signs, but then the signs flop forward when hung on the wall. I'll only be able to use this wire for signs that I can actually hang with a saw tooth hanger, so this wire is worthless to me.
1,It was the worse that I have ever used. Even after I got the quilt together, it started breaking. I spent a day repairing it.
1,Some of these are fantastic, while others don't stick and are useless. It was a waste of time and money.
1,Not great I have to say.  Threads the needle in about one in every ten attempts. Would not buy again.
1,I ordered one and a few days later a friend gave me one as a gift. The zipper broke on one and the strap broke on the other.
1,Could be operater error but didn't work well for me
1,Very low end material.  Beginners kit maybe?
1,I purchased this new weeding tool to be a back-up to my old/first generation Cricut weeding tool. This one is bulkier both in the handle and the metal pick. I can't use this to weed many items, especially any small pieces. It's awkward to hold and will not pick the vinyl up. I guess I can use it in a pinch, but otherwise I consider it a waste of money.
1,Very very small, which makes them a bit difficult to put on and take off. I was shocked at how small they were. So far they are holding fine, but time will tell if they loosen up. I just wish they were bigger and a bit "deeper" to take more of the post without the post poking through (which would negate the reason for using it).		Edited 10/7/2015: I have a pair of stud earrings that I've worn almost daily for at least the last 3 years. Never had a problem, never lost a back off of them or had an earring fall out. But I sleep in them so I wanted something more comfortable, which was the reason for this purchase. Last night I was brushing my teeth and saw that one of my earrings was gone. I searching and found it in the carpeting, then later found the silicone backing in the same general area. Not even a month and this silicone back slipped off. Unfortunately, someone must have stepped on the earring while it was hidden in the carpet because the post was bent and then fell off. So using these back has ruined these earrings that I've had for over 20 years. I don't recommend these silicone backs at all.
1,I am very unhappy with these Head Pins. I don't think I can use these. Not only are they mostly bent, the gold plating was not done properly. The gold color is uneven on each pin that they look like they are beginning to rust. What's even worse are the head of the pins. They are not centered, They are mostly on one side. Save your money and buy a 24 gauge beading wire instead. Make your own eye pins which was what I did since returning these head pins will cost me more money than what these are worth.
1,breaks very easy!!!
1,Beware! Read reviews before you spend the money
1,Weak pins. I didn't intend to purchase Singer, after having read the reviews, but somehow I did. :(
1,I was really disappointed when I opened this and the one little holder that had the quick release gel had leaked all inside the wrapper.  It's pretty shiny if you don't texture it and looks like plastic.  You can texture without the quick release gel :( so there you have it - plastic.
1,I was really excited to try these highly rated needles. I bought a 2 pair of 2.5mm needles for several pairs of socks.  After completing two pair of sports socks, I noticed that the yarn was sticking.  When I looked at the needle, I saw that the finish was worn off both needles.  My fingers smell like metal when I used them....eeewww!!  The tips are fine, but the rest of the needle has lost the finish. Unfortunately, I didn't finish the socks before time ran out to return the faulty needles so I'm stuck with them and really annoyed.  So much for the great addi brand....guess I'll go back to my cheaper Knitters Pride needles.  The joins aren't as perfect but they don't loose their finish.
1,Tried different spools, but this is a worthless hunk of plastic, which i am not used to from NZ. Gave to Goodwill, but can't imagine anyone else will get any use out of it.  Wish i hadn't wasted my money. Purchased the Embroidex 20 spool stand, and it is great.
1,I used this to seal a seam in my costume and one wash and BAM! fell apart.  It's more like hot school glue.  I wouldn't recommend this specific type of glue from this company.
1,I honestly thought I'd be getting a nicer, quality product. But this is just over-priced plastic. I should have saved my time from waiting for the product to arrive by just purchasing something similar (and cheaper) at my local discount craft store.
1,These felt good on my hands and this was the lowest price I found. Tore after one wash on both gloves.		Not for me others seemed to have faired better - Good whilst it lasted.
1,I love the design and the idea of the case, I have many of the Della Q knitting cases. However, when I received this case the thread that is sewn to divide the pockets was missing on the left side and is coming unraveled from the right and will not hold needles as it's supposed to. I am really upset, because I	Love these designs! I hope my other cases do not do the same thing, but to have it like this out of the packaging is a bit discouraging :(.
1,The springs get stuck when I press down and it doesn't give the whole design. I have to manually lift the handle up for it to release the paper. This must be a used item. My lost of money and anticipated project.
1,Useless, only shows secondary colors. Waste of money.
1,Returned. Meir. It like the feel of the hook. Was awakaward shape
1,I don't understand why mine is a weird dark green color- I expected a grey color
1,Don't Know anything about these. Accidently Ordered.
1,This altered the paint color to a milky, bland color tone. Mixed it with a dark brown and it made the color tan which is what I didn't want after mixing both. Mine was runny also, not sure it should be from other reviews.  The clothing was still a bit stiff when dry so I'm not sure it did anything there either. Should've went with Liquitex brand.
1,I got these but a lot of mine were brown or amber colored gemstones, so there wasn't a ton of variety. They were the non vibrant colored ones. Also some of them fell out of the casing for the pendent, I am unsure how to reattach them without adding glue of some sort. Overall I am disappointed and would not by anymore. A few of the stones were pretty but only a few. I would return them if i could!
1,They fall off and if they don't they twist to other places.
1,they torn black very quickly
1,Was never able to achieve more than 50% coverage despite following the directions religiously.
1,Did not work, too cheap to do anything with it or even send it back.
1,This is very difficult to use.  If you don't hold it exactly straight, the needle threader won't work.  Disappointed.
1,So upset! This ribbon is NOT the same size. Really want my money back for this. The ribbon I received was very very smaller then this picture!
1,I purchased these molds to make chocolate and candy spoons to use and give away during the holidays. The mold turned out to be extremely small. The spoons are the size of  demitasse spoons,  about half the height of a teaspoon.  The molds are extremely thin.  They are not very sturdy at all.  You need to place on a baking dish or plate since it is made of a very thin thin sheet of silicone.  They are not at all like the Wilton spoon molds  I had to replaced them with.  I would not recommend these.
1,This adhesive stencil set sucks. I've tried using multiple utensils like Sharpie markers and special glass markers, but it never comes out good. I have to retrace over it, changing the actual font to make it look half decent. But overall, these stencils have been very disappointing and they are almost useless. They just do not work well for art and craft projects. They certainly don't work well for my glass candle holders.
1,This item is useful but the quality may need to be adjusted.  the metal pieces come off the wood fairly easy.  I had to secure them myself.
1,Cannot use.
1,One of the markers (the black one) came out of the package completely dry and unusable. Although I bought it last week it is "not eligible for return".		The grey one works fine, so I only wasted 3.00, but I'm definitely going back to micron now.
1,Stamp is crooked on block, making it difficult to stamp correctly onto a tag.
1,Apparently there are quite a few defective Slice machines.  I had 2 of them.  I was pleased the first time I contacted Making Memories, they had me send the machine in for repair, it still did not cut right, they eventually replaced the machine with a brand new one admitting I had a defective machine.  Received the new machine, used it only a couple of times (my original goal with this machine was to use it cordless at crops, which is impossible because neither held a charge for more than a cut or 2).  Finally took out the machine and it does not cut, now every shape cuts as a partial circle, it's like the motor is junk.  I can't even calibrate it.  MM will only look at the machine with the original sales receipt, and even though the new machine is only a few months old, the warranty covers only from the purchase of the original machine which was over 1 year ago, so now I am stuck with a machine that does not work and a bunch of cards and accessories I can't sell.  This was a very expensive mistake, very disappointed.  Buy a Cricut, I've had that 5 years, cut with it every week, never had a problem.
1,Missed the return window, otherwise would be sending these back.  Bobbin works great until about 80% done.  Then it somehow gets all jammed up with itself, like when it was wound at the factory, it got wound up over itself about 20% into the process.  I ruined one project, and threw out the bobbin.  Got another one, and it did the same thing, except that time it broke my needle!  Thought it was just the black ones, but it did the same thing with a white one, too. Can't afford to be wasting product, losing projects, and possibly ruining my machine over these bobbins.  I now have to RE-WIND each one onto another plastic bobbin before I will chance using them in my embroidery machine.  What an incredible waste of time.  But like I said, I'm not risking my machine or my projects for these crap bobbins. Pictures show the bad one, the good one, and them both together.  The bad one got all jammed up, broke my needle.
1,I don't know what this is for. I tried to use it and it wasn't really effective.	I just as soon use a regular paint brush, which is what I switched to.
1,It does not appear to be real leather.  It looks and feels like brown plastic cord.  I purchased it for a jewelry order that required brown leather for a necklace and I was unable to use this.  I ended up buying another product from my local craft store.
1,I used this on the We R Memory Evolution Embossing machine and it cracked the first time through. I ended up building my own letter press machine because I couldn't find anything sturdy enough. Great customer service from amazon, they took the return the next day
1,Poor quality boards that always arrive with the corners chipped off. If you buy these buy them in person so you can inspect prior to taking it home. I will never puchase again if it chips that easy.
1,I bought this to cut simple stencils with the Silhouette Cameo.  Unlike everyone else, I was able to get my cameo to cut this.  I used Blade 10, Speed 2, Force 33, Passes 7.  I would not use this for intricate cuts.  I cut out bear silhouettes.  My issue is that the plastic is not square & not a full 12x12. If you need it to be 12x12, you are out of luck.  I'm basing the squareness when put the sheet on the silhouette cut mat.  I  if i aligned the left and right vertical sides, then i was short on the top left and bottom right, so not square edges and not a full 12x12.
1,These did not stay lit at all!  They were good for about 1/2 hour but then the tealight would just slowly die out.
1,Paint cracks, have removed and reapplied several times, won't purchase again.
1,I PAID FULL PRICE FOR THIS, so here is a factually honest, truly unbiased, and voluntary review -	This Mat does not heal properly.	I did like the sturdiness of the board and the clear measurement markings, but after just one use the cut marks have remained.
1,heads are too small.
1,Prints are not pronounced
1,these are so hard to use I have arthritis
1,They are too tiny, won't go around anything.
1,The needles are to long, I cant use them. The small metal anchors that hold the needles are to long,  Doing any kind of  knitting is not possible
1,Does not stamp well.
1,Ok I guess
1,Very expensive small skein of yarn.
1,I sewed a pair of overalls for my little grandson, and I was using these around the area where you unsnap for diaper changes. These snaps do not have much grip to them. I ended up taking them all off and creating a better solution than those snaps.
1,Do not use this if you're painting over darker surfaces!  It does not dry clear!
1,The plastic tape measure is a perfectly ordinary tape exactly as you would expect it to be.  The retractable tape, however, is problematic.  The tape itself is extremely narrow and hard to read.  Also, while the mechanism works smoothly in retracting; neither too fast or slow, there is no way to make the tape lock at precisely the spot you want.  It will, indeed, lock, but only in the general area you try to stop it, not on an exact target number.  This is workable but annoying.  This is a soft tape, not metal, so it is necessary for certain uses where a more flexible tape is needed, but it is considerably less useful because of this flaw.
1,These mini canvases were thinner than I expected.  I bought 4x4 canvases from a different brand and they were wider at the sides and could stand upright on a table (because the edges were flat not rolled/curved).  I liked those much better than these, (the painted canvas is the different brand, with the sharp edge).
1,Very flimsy. I do not think they will hold up to bead what I need to do.
1,They wouldn't stay on my needles.
1,ill-made product. junk.
1,Wish I could give this a high rating but unfortunately I'm just not pleased with the way it cuts. I have purchased lots of the Tim Holtz Alteration dies and have been very pleased with them.  This one just don't cut very well at all!!! It would be a beautiful addition to my collection if it would cut properly:(
1,well, yea, total pain. The working end of the thread is no where to be found. Two of the three needles had no thread openings (which is tough, considering I needed the thread to go through the needle and all). Don't let the bargain price fool you - it's just not worth the pain you will surely develop once you attempt to use this.
1,this is a see thru thin cotton material. This is defiantly not broadcloth!!! Not happy with what I got. Guess I will be making a trip to Joann's now.
1,all excited about my new cad red opened up the tube and half oozed out ,first and only time this happened not upset winsor newton still good paint ,I just caught the ooooozzzzzer..
1,Easily comes apart.  the strip that holds the hooks in keeps coming off more and more.  Not worth it the money.
1,I ordered this kit in Lime with 400 eyelets. It was out of stock so I waited. Once in stock, a three week wait, shipping took 4 days, not the 2 day prime shipping it was advertised with, & that I pay yearly for. What I got after all that wait for it to come back in stock was a pink one with 100 eyelets in a smaller case. I was still charged for the higher priced Lime in the case with more compartments & 400 eyelet.  I will be sending this back & buying the one I ordered but from another store. Really annoyed since I've waited patiently for over three weeks for this & really needed it, now my project is on hold again while I search elsewhere for the one I wanted.
1,Smaller than stated. Crystals are fair,not the best...will not purchase from this company again.  Thanks but No Thanks.
1,I mostly wanted these ink pads to antique the edge of cards & to stipple it onto scrapbooking embellishments to give them dimension. The ink pad is so hard, by the time you put enough pressure on the edge of your card to get the ink out, it bends the card & doesn't go on softly as requited to antique a card. I have a very firm stippling brush & it won't even pick up enough ink to stipple with. Definitely returned them. Sure wish Creative Memories still carried their ink pads or that I could find the petal point or cat eye ink pads in the colors I want.
1,Tiny! nothing like the picture at all. I am so disappointed, will never order again .perfect if you work with very tiny beads, picture and disciption are both very misleading. I want a refund!
1,Tiny is an understatement. These are microscopic! I kid you not. Even the customer photos make them look larger than they are. They're about the width of as large seed bead and the length of about 4 of them. Many are bent. Many more you can't thread because the holes are blocked. And then there are the ones where the enameling is missing! I would say there are about 15 that are usable, maybe 15 at the most!  Also, don't expect the full 50. As many have noted they were cut short. I got 42. I ordered on Jan 10 and they finally arrived on Feb 21. 42 days to ship!!!! Now that I have them I'm seeing they truly are useless. How sad. I had high hopes for these.
1,I totally agree on the comments I read about the crystals in poor quality. I finally got mine and most of the crystals I picked to use for my bracelets are either missing some rhinestones or places inverted. I don't think that this are Swarovski crystals. I will use what I can and will not order again.
1,Images do not line up quite right making it difficult what the image is. Not impressed.
1,I'm writing this review one hour after I used this machine for the first time. I only passed my sandwiches through the machine SIX times and THIS is what happened!! (See photos.) I have been a paper crafter/stamper for over a decade. I have been using the Sizzix Big Shot for the past 8 years. I teach a card class once a month and do a LOT of die cutting. I thought the Gemini would help when it came to prepping for class. NO. I read through the instructions over and over again. I even typed up a spreadsheet so that I didn't make a mistake with my sandwich. I followed the instructions TO A "T". Here's what happened... I only cut with the dies that they sent for free with my machine. I was too afraid to put my OWN dies in the thing. Even though I was only cutting one sheet of basic-weight cardstock, the machine moaned and groaned as it fed through, cracking and popping all the way. I tried to hit the reverse button, but it didn't work. That was also concerning. I would think that if a sandwich is too THICK that the machine would spit it back out at you, but sadly that wasn't the case. I ended up with MAJOR WARPING on the clear cutting plates, the metal shim and the magnetic shim. When I tried to emboss with a die (the instructions tell you how to do this), it cut ALL THE WAY through the rubber shim on the first pass. Tore it to pieces. Here's another thing that happened that was TOTALLY CRAZY--I attached my spreadsheet on the machine with 6 pieces of scotch tape. It was perfectly flat against the machine with no gapping. When the sandwich fed through the machine, it was twisting and warping my spreadsheet to the point that I thought the tape was going to give way!! When the sandwich fed through, the spreadsheet went flat again. As far as how well it cuts the dies...it's total crap. Using the recommended sandwich, it STILL didn't cut every piece of the die all the way through. It took me 3 times as long as it should have to poke the pieces out of the paper with my piercer tool.	Bottom line - if someone gave me this machine for free, I still wouldn't use it.	P.S. I bought this item as a PRIME listing (2-3 days shipping, right?), but when I would track it, it said that my item would arrive on a certain day, then they postponed the delivery date 3 times. After 10 days, it still had not arrived so I called Amazon. They said that it was shipping from overseas and that was what was causing the delay. I told Amazon that it shouldn't have been a prime listing! Amazon probably contacted the seller because two days later it arrived. I was SOOOO excited.... until.........
1,I am so disappointed. I purchased this thread two weeks ago and tested one spool. Performance was great and I was ready to write a positive review. I decided to buy another box (same listing!) and received much smaller spools - see photo. The spool on the left is the new one I received and the spool on the right is the one I have been using. The new spool is significantly smaller - it has a larger cardboard center and is still much smaller in circumference. The thread is also a lot thinner, so it is hard to determine, but I highly doubt that there are 1,000 yards on this spool.  The "older" spool, despite being used in two projects (top & bobbin), still has a much larger circumference. Buyer beware. I would not compare reviews prior to March 2017 with reviews after March 2017, as this is NOT the same product. I am returning the new thread and will not be testing it.  If the manufacturer / seller want to change the product significantly, they need to change the listing, not list a inferior product under the reviews gained by a superior thread. Good riddance.		Edit: The photo is flipped and I can't get it to reset, but the smaller spool obviously is the "newer" one.
1,I have a cuttlebug, and this die doesn't work very well. The mug comes out (for the most part), but I am never able to use the "steam" and the word "latte" . No matter what combination of plates or paper I use, it just doesn't cut through.
1,It works but it's wimpy. Also you can only punch a few holes then you have to figure out how to line them up to get them to punch correctly. There are no instructions included. When it says 3 sheets of paper, it means 3 sheets of paper. $ and you may not gets it to punch. I'm going to buy an Arc punch
1,Uneven sizes, break easily...  Pretty to behold - but absolutely lousy to bead with.
1,bought these for my girls and the needles broke its not durable at all, will not buy again
1,jury's still out;
1,These are comfortable to use. If that's your primary concern they're a 4 star item. I used the with water colors and found that they don't draw up pigments well. It's frustrating to not be able to do a wash or move color accross the page effectively. I'll deal with the sore hand and have since upgraded to better preforming brushes.
1,Useless! It fell apart before I could use it and the pieces couldn't be out back together.
1,It broke.  Just never bothered to replace it.
1,No one ever tells you the truth. The truth is people hype this up because they have low standards. If you hate wrinkling and want something that looks above a 2nd grade level, don't get this. It's Elmer's glue with water.  Get acrylic gel medium and it'll be worth all the money and don't both with this. Don't even second guess this with all the useless praise with this.
1,First of all, this is not pure black, it's dark blue trying to pass off as black.  Cheap black dye is often like that.  Secondly it's very weak.  The directions say to use 1/8th per 2lbs of wax.  I wound up using 3x more than that and it still just looked blue.  If you're looking for a proper color, don't buy this junk.
1,its a nice color.  it wasn't my first choice but they didn't h ave the one I wanted.  It's being a bit more difficult than some others i have tried.  oh well
1,I would not buy this for any child. Its confusing and the strands of yarn they send aren't long enough to get everything done. Great idea, wrong set up.
1,Returned as the ends were flattened due to size markings, making them useless for insertion into knit edges. These wires must be a welding product not altered for blocking use.
1,I bought this and another mat from a different seller the same day. Both were described self healing mats. I bought this mat because it rotates and the mat was recommended by another reviewer on here who quilts. However, I would not buy this mat again as it did not "heal" near as well as my calibre art mat. There are grooves all across the surface which makes it rough. I used both mats equally. They both had grooves - this mat simply does not appear as durable and "healed" less.. Save your money and buy a better quality mat.
1,Not very happy, they get all wrinkly when you use aren't you press on them that's why got them so that I could make perfect circles with material they can't take the heat
1,The glue when dried doesn't stick very well
1,If you want the color to be as it appears on the container - Don't buy this! I used it on white cotton and it came out like a brown-maroon color, which is nothing like the color on the container.
1,These are not the pink and white pins shown or described here. I've purchased them in the past, and loved them. Received multi-colored pins instead. This is very disappointing, and not really worth the time and effort to refund or exchange.
1,Garbage!! I regret buying this stuff. I bought it to hold my wire together temporarily but it did not work out. I thought the low tack would leave very little residue which it does but it doesn't stick together enough to leave anything behind!!
1,Not good product !	Stacks all the time	Can not work right!
1,very cheaply made
1,Doesn't work. Don't waste your money
1,lousy, nothing cuts
1,This blade works great, however, when I ordered it as the description states, they are ' 45mm Pinking Rotary BLADES', not a single blade. I was quite upset to pay as much as I did for a single blade. Don't be fooled by the description, as it is not plural, you are paying for ONE blade!		The quality is no better than any others out there as far as rotary blades go, and certainly not worth the extra cost. I would recommend one shop around for a better price and certainly ASK about how many you are buying before you order them!
1,Got these brushes and am unimpressed.. The ferrule was all warped on 2 out of 3 brushes, a protective cap was missing from one of the brushes and they're hard to control to get the kind of strokes I am looking for, as the bristles are poorly tapered and tend to choose when they want to paint thin lines or not. Going to use these a bit more to see if I can achieve anything good from them, but definitely not what I expected and very poor quality. 2 stars for the price/size differences, but other than that, these aren't very good quality brushes.
1,Horrible needle set. interchangeable needles are useless because it dislodges frequently causing the yarn to unravel! save your money and instead buy "ADDI TURBO" needles which make knitting much faster and does not dislodge!!!!
1,I hate this thread....it breaks easily when hand sewing(at least when I do it)		What I was looking for was the Gutermann top stitch heavy duty thread.....my bad....what I got was the Sew All thread which is not really for hand sewing, but is probably excellent for machine sewing.		My wife has a sewing machine, I don't so I'm giving it to her.
1,Man this was messy.  Maybe I should have expected it, but I was anticipating larger white flakes.  This makes me think someone took a cheese grater to those Styrofoam craft balls and made Styrofoam dust.  It jumped all over my when I opened the bag - seems like some static business going on.  And I just tried to put a little on my plate and it got all over the table.  I think it is so light that it is difficult to contain.  But it does look like snow.  Might be nice in a jar or vase filler if you plan to open once and never touch again and don't mind a little clean-up.  But not good for kid craft which is what I was hoping for.
1,It worked fine until I broke it
1,Clearly, the worst scissors I have ever purchased.  I do not understand the fascination with Tim Holtz products.  These scissors are HORRIBLE!.  Terrible for detail cutting, leaving rough edges and little 'bits' attached to my cutouts.  Cutting through a single layer of cheap, clear packing tape left LOADS of residue on the blades, which I could not entirely remove (used GooGone).  The "Kushgrip" is anything but cushy - they hurt my hands after cutting images on just one layer of the lightest card stock.  A pair of children's rounded scissors would cut better than these!  Don't waste your time or money - these are total garbage!
1,Tried these the same day they came in. They cut well, but they bend and warp the paper. It makes the finished product useless. See pictures. This happened with all 3 sizes I tried. Sending back.
1,The needle so big not size11, not work for small bead. But working so well with spinner. I'm wasting the money.
1,I'm sure everyone orders these beads with a project in mind, just as I did. I ordered the purple amethyst beads based on the picture of them in the listing. Unfortunately the beads I received look nothing like the picture. The beads I received are all the same color, which is mostly a clear, medium to light purple color. Nothing like what was pictured. I was very disappointed in the beads I received. I have since ordered another set of beads got the aforementioned project. Be warned, the item you receive may not be the same as what is pictured.
1,Do not buy this. It leaves a funky film on your thread and actually made the thread MORE tangled!!!! I do not use it anymore. It took away the pretty colors of the thread...maybe I used too much, but I thought it would help untangle the thread better. Yuck!
1,What I received looks nothing like what was posted on line.  I ordered 2 strands because the online picture looked very interesting and beautiful.  The beads I received are mostly clear translucent beads with each strand having about 10 out of 46 beads that have some color.  Very disappointing.
1,Insanely long to receive (5 weeks) Beads are poor quality but you get what you pay for. Won't be purchasing from this seller again
1,The yarn came without any protection.  It has several dirty spots on the yarn.  Very disappointed!
1,This is the worst product I've ever ordered from Amazon.  The top of the box was "two" pieces of wood.  There is no way I could have placed a design on the top of this box and sent it as a gift.  (Grrrr.)  Also the bottom of the box was "three" pieces of wood.  You could see right through the "slats".  This is a very poor quality item and I would never order anything like this through Amazon again.
1,Absolutely nothing "heavy duty" about this clunker.  I bought it specifically to sew leashes and collars.  Did not handle even two layers of the poly webbing.  Very noisy.  No needle threader was the clincher...returned it next day!
1,Didn't work for the purpose that I wanted to use it for. Along with this item, I purchased chalkboard labels for mason jars that I was preparing for my event. The ink did not stick, ran everywhere and the tip was messy to use. I am not sure what exactly you can use this on because I received an email notice stating that this product is only intended for non-porous surfaces. Whatever the case, these pens are going back. I just ended up using real chalk to serve my purpose. Again, the biggest con to this product is that its very messy-from my experience. Also, surprised that Amazon recommended these very pens to purchase for use with the labels that I bought.
1,Product is fine, however,..the description said I would get 30 erasers and I only got 10 in my package.
1,If I had purchased this software at the original price, I would ask for a refund.	The software doesn't work on several programs and locks up your computer. Provo craft did a terrible job with this software.	Also, didn't try to enhance for all users but abandoned the whole project.
1,It seemed fine but in less than a month the metal legs, which seem thin for their use, simply separated at the connection.  Not what I would want to order again.
1,Came apart after one use
1,All three of the boxes arrived completely hardened out.  The clay inside the boxes was not wrapped in any plastic, so perhaps the individual boxes themselves have drawn out the oils from the clay.  I attempted to chip off a small piece of the clay from a corner of the block, and it was very brittle and had no malleability.  I trust the Sculpey brand, as so many of the sculptors that I watch on Youtube use it.  Maybe mine was just a bad batch?  Maybe it was just really old?  Either way, the clay needs to be checked before it is shipped out. (And no, this was not salvageable with baby oil or any other substance.  It would have been like mixing completely dry flakes of clay with oil.  I think that would take hours, which is not the intent of this product and not worth the price if I have to condition it myself with my own oils.)
1,too hard patern not printed on screne
1,Don't like these at all.  Fingers holes are not sturdy so pressure is unevenly applied.  Purchased a pair of Elan 4" which are MUCH better.
1,Lots of thin spots, frays easily.  Not the quality I expect from Red Heart.
1,Cheap and bends with pressure. I have missed placed them or I would have returned them. Pay the extra couple of bucks and get a different set.		I could not believe how they bent (indented my fingers where I applied pressure when I used them). Flimsy. I would have left zero stars if I were allowed
1,it is not fine point and takes long time to link coming out.
1,kinda regret the purchase. I don't have a need for so many and I'm not thrilled with the shades. I don't have place to store them all.	I used them on an adult coloring book, and realized the tips are too thick for the fine-details of the adult coloring book. So I kept making mistakes, and getting frustrated, lol....  it doesn't fulfill the need that I had, but they are perfectly fine markers.
1,the item looks larger but when you get it it looks like something a child can play with. I would not waste my money.
1,Do not work at all
1,Got the wrong color and wrong price.  I guess I have learned a valuable lesson in doing business with this company.  I needed the items and they have taken longer than expected and this one came as Heather Grey.  Also the quality is not so great especially for the price I ended up paying.		Here`s their feedback	4 of Caron Simply Soft Heather Yarn, 5 Ounce, Heather Grey [ASIN: B00CI1UIYW]	1 of Caron Simply Soft Yarn 6oz (9702) Off White By The Each [ASIN: B005Q1OHWU]		------------- Begin message -------------		Ok it look's like you will need to contact Amazon Support. They are the ones who handled and shipped this package for you. Good luck!		==	I am told GOOD LUCK - It`s not our problem.
1,Chincy, poorly built. Arrived with the tongs mashed together so no gap was possible. I disassembled it at sprung he tongs but haven't used it yet. The tips are rough from manufacturing so I'm not sure they will deposit the ink or masking fluid, the purpose I got them for. They are really small I've never seen them so small. I'm really disappointed and feel a little duped bu I'm going to see if they will work before I return them. I'll let you know.
1,I am very unhappy with the "wood" box that this comes in. It is beyond cheap. It's like molded sawdust. There is no way the hinges will stay inside this crap material for long. I will be returning this and getting the same kit that comes in a zippered bag of sorts. It looks better and has to be better than this darn box. The plastic inserts holding the pens and blades is ridiculously tight. I had to pry the knives out with a screwdriver. Just things to think about if you ever use this regularly. Great set, just in a horrible box...
1,So terrible. One sheet for $7 that is just ridiculous. Not worth the money.
1,I couldn't get get these to cut out a nice die cut, and I have a lot of fancy detailed dies that I have great luck with. Plus these are really small.
1,this is more of a paper w/a sticky side rather than actual tape.  and it does not stick very well.  its stiff so its also hard to get to adhere to what you want to put it on  and the is such a small amount on the roll that its really not good for any kind of project.  pretty disappointed in  this purchase.
1,i got the wrong item i ended up getting the fastener setter
1,broke all the time
1,I hate the cutter and the accessories that come with it!
1,Wrong item description! It is stated that it is 364 yards and when received it the yarn is 244 yard. This is overpriced for the yardage. WalMart has 244 yards for $2.50
1,By the time you get this working correctly (hint, put a piece of printer paper over the tissue paper on the side facing the blades), you can do the exact same thing with a pair of scissors. This item was definitely not up to the standards of this usually fabulous line; I love the Martha Stewart Acrylic Paints among other items. This is flimsy and somewhat pointless. I would definitely avoid - this is just a useless gadget to clutter your craft room/area.
1,I found it useless
1,needles easily break and causes a lot of aggravation.
1,Very disappointed. The lid on the needle case does not fit, so it will not stay on.
1,I thought this would be a really unique and useful set but it is not.  The images do not stamp nicely.  I have tried several different types of ink pads and cannot get a nice image.  They come with an instruction sheet and it warns of the chemical smell and they are not kidding.  Most of the smell does go away after a few days thank goodness.  You have to cut the images apart and they are so close together it is difficult.  The stamped images  on the storage sheet started to come off as soon as I touched i.t  I looked down and there were little pieces of black all over my table...then I saw that the images were disappearing.  I had to print and laminate  a new sheet with the images for storage because the one that came with it was literally rubbing off when I set the stamps on it.  I would certainly not buy any of these stamps from this line again
1,These are not shiny - very dull.  So sad.  They look beautiful in the pic.
1,So I'm kind of disappointed in these.  I soaked for 10 minutes in molten wax at 175 and I used 444 soy wax. Initially when I lit, the flame was high and looked beautiful,  but once it burned down a little the flame became very low, andi was getting more light from the glowing the stick than the actual flame.  May want to double up on the wicks like a lot of people recommend here.
1,These needles are rough to the touch, not nickle plated. The cord is the wrong color and the typeface on the cord is wrong.  These have to be counterfeit. Do not trust this listing. Will be filing a complaint.
1,Does not look like picture and are much smaller than described-item does not have the luster quality I associate with glass beads
1,Sides very soft and mishapen with bobbins. Picture misleading--says small or large.  No. Just small.  No large bobbins for this one. Seller needs to change pic and description. Seller misleading.
1,Reviews are right. The metal tube splits with the pressure teenage boys put on it in art class and the tip broke off in transit.
1,The brush looks nice in the picture but when i used it to apply gesso the hairs kept falling out.
1,Received my pencils today one of the two had a broken tip apparently before packaging as it was not in the package at all! Also its bigger then most pencils and will not sharpen good Im very dissatisfied.
1,looks like plastic, not leather
1,problem with ink  coming out in blobs
1,Total junk.  Vinyl bunches up in the feeder and you end up having to babysit the job which defeats the purpose of having the roller in the first place.
1,Item was defective so I can not really give it a good review.  However I have heard others have had a wonderful experience with this machine.
1,lighter than pictured and were smaller.
1,Defective and could not be used.....already cut and had kinks that could be be straightened out.
1,I have written to the company, but I get no answer.  This product is defective.  The plastic protective cable has become detached from the rest, ad yarn gets caught in the small gap.  To keep stitches moving some back and forth movement before knitting can proceed.  This becomes quite annoying.  Finally I replaced it, but I still have a defective needle that I will not use.		This is not true of any of the other Square needles that I have used.
1,As thin as tracing paper and a very small roll. Go elsewhere
1,These are terrible. They break while sharpening, down inside the wood - used a whole pencil marking just a few pieces. When you can get a point on them, the lines are too thick to be accurate. Do not purchase.
1,I was excited to use this mat. When I opened the package it had a weird strong chemical smell. The smell gave me a headache and it made the paper smell too. I tossed it after one use
1,This yarn is very coarse. It was not nice to work with. The colors are play, but I hated crocheting with this.
1,I purchased these and after having worked with them for awhile now, have discovered about half of them don't open.  I can understand a few pieces not working but half or better?  Not a good buy.
1,Needles very short, from the picture I thought I was getting regular sized needles but these are so small that I shall be unable to use them, maybe for someone who wants to make miniature items but not for me.
1,Awful leaky and ruined my art
1,This particular ink pad was not "fully loaded" as most ColorBox pads are. The ink did not transfer to the stamp well, even with repeated 'pumps' on the pad. Perhaps it is old but it is not of the quality I paid for or expected. Unfortunately, I am not able to return this as Amazon/seller won't allow it. I won't be purchasing from this seller again.
1,Order never arrived.. E-mails to seller went unanswered..do not order from this supplier..
1,The cable is much too short. I didn't like these at all because the cable is so short that the needles get in the way of each other. Very poor design. Buyer beware! Everything from this brand is measured from tip to tip and the lengths stated are the length of the whole product, not the cables. This is a very difficult product to use due to the extremely short cable length. I bought these to make socks and found myself struggling to make anything at all with them. I am an experienced knitter. I'm now very happily knitting with a set of needles that come with adjustable cable length. Those are worth the money.
1,I'm not a fan of this brand of yarn, I won't buy it again, but that is just my personal preference. It snags and unravels a lot more that the yarn I am used to.
1,not what I thought this might be or was; way too small..
1,All soeedvall products are bad... go with ryonet if anything
1,So bummed about this.  The case is ADORABLE.  The colours are GORGEOUS.  But over half of my hooks have rough spots with "catch" the yarn and cause it to pull and separate the yarn :(		So bummered, I want to love these so much!
1,This is a rickety device.  A tall pickle jar will keep the thread unthreading from the top of the cone as recommended.
1,I've only used this machine  3 times.  The 2nd time I used it the automatic threader broke.  It had to be taken off.  i figured I'd just manually thread like I always have.  I started a quilt. Easy piecing this weekend.  Straight stitch, Nothing fancy.  All of a sudden the needle is in the left position instead of center and I can't get it back to center.  I can move it manually with my finger,  so it doesn't seem stuck, but no matter what I do ( trying to reset to center, several times) it wont' go back in position.  It's hard to get a hold of anyone at Brother.  I had to send an e-mail.  Waiting on a reply.  Very frustrated.  Still a new machine and I can't use it.		"Additional comments" 6/30/14		I did get a service rep at Brother.  Gave me the closest dealer to take it to for repair.  It's an hour away.  Hopefully they will accept my Amazon purchase verification as proof it's still under warranty. Saying it will be about 2 weeks. Quilt project on hold.
1,I am visiting friends and helping the daughter make a patchwork quilt. This is their home machine.		The thread consistently escapes the needle, and there is trouble with the bobbin thread tension. I would not buy this machine.		Plus side: it is quiet and offers a lot of decorative stitches, which we did not try because we can barely get the machine to operate at a basic level.
1,is not easy for a kid
1,Bottle of ink arrived burst all over the package :(
1,Very disappointed. There was 6x12" that was unusable.
1,Very poor quality for the money. The bobbins are very poor quality, bendy, and with rough edges. The organizer is OK but many of the compartments are twisted so the bobbins to not fit well. Would not buy again. No where near as nice as the one I have had for about 20 years but was getting too small for all my floss.
1,Even there are 4 in the package but they do not really cut. I received them in a box and when I opened I found that the original cover is unsealed and opened and the scissors are here and there. They barely cut paper and the tip of each scissor does not work and not sharp. Keep your money for a better thing.
1,Poor quality, yars breaks easily  while doing crochet
1,They look like the tarnish easy. Kind of disappointed !
1,This yarn is soooo horrible I don't even want to  use it. Its hard and stiff.  Rough feel
1,first needle broke the first time I used it. I've never had an issue with any needle in my machine before. Flimsy!
1,Half were broken	Half had sticky worn off	Junk
1,When it arrived, it was packed great, was very easy to set up, the problem came when I tried to use it. It felt like the gears were glued together. Unfortunately I ended up returning it.
1,Awful pins, very blunt. I haven't found a sharp one. Great price/value but useless. They don't even pierce through paper. I can get them to go through Styrofoam though or my half body store mannequin that has a foam body but with effort. I had high hopes for these since I got my new Roxy dressform and needed pins with bright visible ends to see clearly to remove and find on my brown floors. Great color/value/price but what good does it do when they don't function as made. I guess I I must still buy local at a ridiculous high price point.
1,The price was right however, there is no way of sealing these jars. I thought I could use them to store different color paints after use but no such luck. I will end up engineering a seal myself.
1,so far everything that was from point zero has broke first it was the gun always kept it clean but until the dam nozzle shot out and something that small would be gone, Then the regulator went down so I ordered a new one took the old one off put the new one on but it kept leaking tried plumbing tape on threads  nothing, the only way it would work if the regulator was upside down then a month later the knob to adjust the pressure stopped working could turn it down on low only worked turned almost all the way up so much of a pain in the a$$ I would have spent just a little bit more money I might not be out a compressor and two guns!!
1,Not as good as I thought it would be, cannot sew a 1/4" seam with this.
1,wont uncurl- useless for plotter cutter.
1,cheap, everything in it is awkward to use.
1,I used this to try to remove the green color from a t-shirt that I was going to dye blue. It was 100% cotton and could be washed in hot water.  I followed the directions to the letter ( I am NOT a novice when it comes to dying), and virtually nothing came out! Now I still have a useless green T-shirt and I have to go buy something white to try to dye it.  The RIT liquid dyes are especially good, but this product is just plain awful.
1,When the beads arrived I was very disappointed with the quality.  Most of the beads were the color green, and at least 5 were chipped.  On the advertisement the beads appear to be very pretty, but not what I received.  I guess we have to remember, we get what we pay for!  Don't waste your money on these.
1,I bought it cause price, but the block is too soft to make any dents with out a lot of force being done
1,very thin and barely sticky. reminds me of floral tape before it's been stretched. colors are not as vivid as shown.
1,Supermart (Ellison) shows "IN STOCK" after waiting almost a week I get a cancellation notice because it's out of stock. This listing STILL SHOWS IN STOCK!!! Not a good way to do business. I could have gone elsewhere if they kept their inventory updated!
1,It holds 80 pencils, and questionable if it is leather.
1,doesn't cut material very well ... will not ever purchase again
1,Fine for beginners.  Cord is stiff and needle is a little too short for my liking (before the bend).
1,Returned.
1,Thought these would all be small so I could use them for embellishments.
1,This product is not worth the cost of the raw materials.  When I tried to open it, the fragile plastic hinges all broke.  Shame on me for trusting a product from Singer.  Never again.
1,Chinese crystals. Cloudy. I didn't like them.
1,cheap letter stickers, there are no straight lines, every letter looks like it was cut out with a guy with a serious shaking hand, they are not very sticky, and they fall off the backing easily.  don't do as they advise and pull off the unused portion so only the letters are left, because it willl pull off half the letters and periods, commas and all the small stuff.  I don't know if its because they are only 1/2 inch, aybe they would be cleaner cuts if they were biger letters, I don't know, it seems like they use a melting process to cut the letters out?  for what I need this is good enough, but if you are looking for something nice and clean, find a different brand.
1,VinylXSticker LLC is not allowing returns on items regardless of circumstance. I received two rolls of vinyl damaged and cannot return them. Very upset as I have used this seller and product many times before. DO NOT PURCHASE UNLESS POLICY CHANGES.
1,Be aware that this is smaller than it appears - suitable for a date stamp, perhaps.
1,These aren't very soft.  The edges are actually hard so they didn't work for my needs.
1,They're fine, but MUCH thinner and flimsier than my We R Memory Keepers page protectors, so that was kind of surprising and disappointing.
1,These are the smaller, flimsy clothespins. Use carefully as they tend to slip apart, separate from the spring. I was specifically looking for the regular size, more durably made. It's hard to discern online. They work as paper clips or clips to close the potato chip bag. If that's all you need, but overpriced for sure. And, they got lost in the mail and required me to follow up, twice.
1,This is made af veryu flimsy plastic and will not stand up to any use at all.  The base is so badly machined that I couldn't get the thread stand in the hole (let alone scre in the screw).  I had to re-drill it to get rid of plastic burrs !!  The base is so light that any slight tug will pull it over.  The b ase needs to be attached to a block of wood or metal.  The stand itself waves in the breeze because it is so flimsy (OK slight exaggeration but you get the idea - as cotton pulls it bends !!).		Realistically:  Get a wire coat-hangar and a cheap C-Clamp from Home Depot for $3 and make your own.  Make a U shaped wire with one arm longer than the other and then put an eye in the top of the long one.  Put a kink in the bas of the U that is horizontal to the table.  C-Clamp the base to the table.  Short leg of the U to put the thread on.
1,This is the best example of false advertising I have ever seen!  Although the product illustration shows bobbins with colored thread wrapped around them and then the bobbins placed IN the box, I was VERY ANNOYED that the box is just a cheap, empty, plastic box!		I HATE IT!  IT'S FALSLY ADVERTISED! BEWARE OF THIS MERCHANT!
1,I can fit in one bar of homemade soap but only just. The worst of it with these bags is that your soap needs to be white or pale and without a pattern otherwise you cannot see the writing or flowers on the bag.
1,After second use, the wooden stick broke; am disappointed with this product.
1,too tiny, this size isn't very useful
1,Way way small. Read size before buying. My fault assuming size. Pictuis deceiving. Sturdy but small. Using for bead not paper
1,This is not 5" in size as per the description - it is ridiculously small
1,I purchased these pens for an Art project.  I thought that buying a box of twen? I would be ahead of the game. I was wrong. Apparently these are sold in a box of ten. Because they are onlky a quarter filled with Ink. All Ten pens were gone  in a period of two days. Very poor pens if you need them for longer than a week.
1,Although these needles are listed for Brother sewing and embroidery machine, they were just a little, tin bit to long, and all they did was break thread in my machine. Very disappointed. Sent back for refund.
1,These beads are very cute, and I really wanted to use them, but they are only carved on the top and won't stay right side up. So they're pretty much worthless. Sent them back.
1,This is not the German Carbide Blade. It is the Cricut blade with the white cap.
1,I was looking for long hooks for Tunisian crochet. There are not many out there. I was willing to risk ordering these because of the low price. They are ok. I do have several hook ends that are rough and jagged and I will be taking some super fine grit paper to them so they will not snag on my yarn so much. I also received double 7 mm hooks and no 8 mm hook, so I have contacted the seller on that.	*editted*	Interesting turn of events. I heard back from the seller. They have tiny print that states "Please allow 1-2cm differs due to manual measurement".(this is directly copied from their reply to me.) Apparently there is no pride in workmanship or product. They can send you two clearly marked 7mm hooks because they are covered by their tiny print. I guess they thought I was stupid and would only look at the color of the hook and be fooled into thinking it was a different width.
1,My fault I did not pay attention to demensions..should have...was very small in size.  Would have loved it if it had been bigger.  Gave away to a friend.  Couldn't use it myself...not big enough.
1,I don't know how others thought this quality was so good.  If you're a quilter you won't like it for nice projects.  It's not a tight enough weave so it stretches quite easily., I don't know what I'll use it for, but not a quilt..  Definitely will shrink when washed..
1,Having used the large Dylusions journal, I was excited to see them come out with one that was a much better size for portability.  Since there was absolutely nothing in the description even from Ranger that told me that this was anything other than a smaller size of the larger journal, I was extremely disappointed.  Once I received the two I ordered, I discovered that the small size does NOT contain the wonderful creamy cardstock paper that is perfect for paint and other mixed media that composed half of the larger journal.  I feel hoodwinked, actually since Ranger knew full well why people loved the large journal so much.  And they definitely knew how people were going to feel about the switch because so many were driven to Dylusions when the Moleskine quit using the creamy cardstock.
1,mine broke 2 days later asked for new one never did get resonse so I gave up and threw it away
1,I only received one package with 5 needles. Contacted Amazon and was refunded for purchase. Schmetz needles are great needles and this would have been a great buy.
1,A great idea, BUT: Not-trivial learning curve, difficult to use, and the plastic stays break frequently when you're trying to inset them. Not worth the trouble.
1,Not happy with this. I thought this wasn't supposed to move while sewing to help guide, but even though its magnetic, it slides. Waste of money.
1,too shiny, like black vinyl, and cheap looking. the braiding is loosely woven. not sure I can ever use these at all.
1,This product is hard to work with and gives me a headache. I end up not cleaning my stamps because the lingering smell makes me feel like I drank a bottle of it.
1,A Waste of time -- took 9 days to et them -- and money. These were THIN, light weight , if fanned, they would flop. Thinner than the	cardboard backing of my writing pad. Profoundly disappointed. They look and feel like CARDBOARD! I would have returned them but  as I waited so long to get them and my need is great, I'll use them. But will never again buy these or from this supplier.
1,I am not likely to buy these ever again they are to chalky when they dry and they leave a dusty feeling on the paper once they are dry they at best very poor quality paints
1,These look nice, but the buckles jam and/or don't stay in place on about 7 out of the 10. Not very practical.
1,Very hard to get onto the crocheting needle. I wasted some money on this. Threw them away.
1,Great patch
1,Order this lot of 3, and received lot of one.
1,These are highly pigmented oil pastels that are water soluble.  Some of the colors are easier to manipulate than others.  My only real issue with these is the fact I received TWO Cadmium Greens.  I mean I like green as much as the next person but two is a bit much yeah?		And then there's the impossible task of contacting the seller to see what can be done.  I don't even know what color I'm missing.		I see now - Cobalt Green is missing.
1,I also thought it was for 5000 not for 8 pcs.  On top of that, basically you are paying more than 5 dollars for 8 plastic beads.  Not worth it.  Then, you will plan to return it but you are also responsible for the cost of shipping which would give you maybe a 2 dollar refund after the shipping cost.  I will never buy these again.
1,1. This floss is very soft & silky. The skeins are standard 6 strands per thread. They should be easily divisible like DMC, Coats, or Iris 6-strand floss. However, when I tried to seperate the strands, the floss stretched and tangled. I wasted a lot of floss trying to get a few lengths of smoothly seperate strands.		2. There were 100 skeins of floss in nice vivid colors.  In a couple of instances there were more than 2 skeins of 1 color. In one instance there were 4 skeins of one color. Don't expect to receive 100 all different colors.
1,This thing came apart constantly. One reviewer said that all you have to do is give the arm on the side (the one that holds the yarn up) a good yank and it locks into place. Sure it does... for about three seconds. Then it falls down again. It doesn't "lock" into place.  This thing is flimsy as hell and the spindle in the middle goes flying off the cog that spins it ALL THE TIME. I even made a point of triple-checking to make sure it was "locked" into place but it still just randomly comes undone unless you're winding slower than mollasses.		Save yourself the $20.  DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.
1,Ugh !!!!!!! I usually like buying from Beadnova, but don't waste your time with the Tridacna Stone Box. First of all, the 4mm ones come in all different kinds of sizes, some are a little bigger than 4 mm others smaller...	Second of all, many beads were CRACKED !! Which I noticed, AFTER I already made a bunch of bracelets and sold them - so I couldn't return the box. Very sad about that.  I'm not going to purchase these again.
1,I have degenerative disc disease in my lower coccyx and thought this would help. It made the problem worse. It really hurts to sit on this cushion. Very uncomfortable to try to keep balancing myself as it tends to shift your body around. I know this is what it is supposed to do but it hurts me to be rolling around every time I move in my chair. It's easier for me just to stand up and readjust myself from time to time. I wouldn't recommend this product for people that have tail bone pain.
1,I don't know if it's this brand or if I just got a bad blade, but it wouldn't even cut through one layer of fabric. It felt dull to the touch. I ended up just throwing it away and using my pinking sheers instead. It was very disappointing, a waste of time and money.
1,SUCKS! ROOM FOR THREE BRUSHES HARD TO OPEN AND CLOSE PLASTIC SNAPS  BS!
1,So far, both Delta stencils I've ordered have arrived warped, which makes them unusable for many techniques.  (They've been under heavy books for two days and are still warped.  The only way to make it flat is to hold it down with two hands...leaving none to work with!  Surprisingly, the plastic is thicker than many stencils.  HINT TO SELLER:  Today, I received a more delicate stencil from another brand and it was in perfect condition because they took the time to put the stencil between two sheets of cardboard before mailing.
1,I tried using this to attach rhinestones to different material and surfaces and didn't work at all, so not happy
1,No matter how carefully I try to use them the silver chips off almost immediately...I haven't had any luck with any of the covers I've tried to use. They are made well shape and size wise, but I couldn't use any of them. I wouldn't get these again.
1,I'm actually pretty disappointed in this paper, I typically really like Canson's products, so when I was given a very cool set of art markers for Christmas, I ordered this to use with them (the ink bleeds on the heavier Canson papers, like the sketch pad and the multi-media pad). This stuff pretty much feels like a tablet of printer paper. I don't love it. I don't even like it. Really disappointing.
1,I used this on white cotton and it came out very dark green. It certainly doesn't look like the color on the container.
1,I tried this on a small piece of nylon I wanted to dye black, and it tinted it purple...	This was just a removable strap, so I could get an idea of how it would work.	I heated the water up, but it just didn't take well.		There is still enough left to attempt the item I want to do (LBV vest), but I'm not sure if I should bother. I'd rather have an ugly CP pattern, than a tinted purple CP pattern :3		I may try again with hotter water, and with a bunch of vinegar to help it bite into the fabric.		It was 3 bucks, so it's not a total loss.. But i'm still frustrated. It's drying now and I made a bit of a mess.
1,save your money, very poor quality of fabric, no two pieces the same size..they are not true fat quarters..Didn't find out till after order was placed that it came from china..it was cut crooked two pieces had small slices in them..SAVE YOUR TIME ...I knew it was too good to be true  looking at the price, but thought I'd take a chance.sending it back would cost more then it's worth....typical CHINA made product..
1,Filled it according to the instructions.  Made sure not to over fill it and yet it leaks like a sieve at both the brush tip and the fine tip.  Really not impressed.
1,While the charms themselves are nice, the enamel looks like someone just dabbed some turquoise paint in a hurry and didn't care if it looked like how it was pictured.  Very sloppy.  Also (a heads up to others who are looking to buy) the charms are single sided, which was not posted in the product description.
1,not a good product, took mine off the rulers two days after using the rulers.
1,Ive tried to use this glue over and over for years now. I love it's precision tip and small nozzle. I hate it at the same time. The cap has a stick in it to help keep the glue from clogging. While that's great and all, and it actually seems to work, I have yet to figure out how to keep the tube itself from gooping up. The tube becomes unusable about half way through and I notice it takes a lot of glue and effort to get any out.  It's almost like the glue begins to solidify inside the tube, making it virtually pointless to use. I've quit using this product more times than I can count, but keep returning when I see a suggestion for a project online, recommends using it. I'm beginning to think this product is being used because there isn't too much out there like it. (the precision nozzle, the glue itself is ok, not better or worse than some other well known products. )		I only recommend this glue if you plan on gluing a lot of items all at once. Then the glue can't get goopy inside the tube and you'll have more control over its application. Currently I couldn't glue a single stone without leaving glue streaks all over the place around the stone.		As for it sticking to fingers. I disagree with other posters. Maybe they are gluing projects for personal use or not for sale, but I know it does stick to fingers. I found that it isn't obvious or annoying though. Currently my finger tips on my right hand are coated with it. I tried the old 'rub it off' method when it was wet(ter), that only spread it out and made a fine layer. It's still there, just not as obvious or intrusive as other glues on finger tips.		After the little bit I can get out of my no more than half way used tube, I'm officially quitting this product. I do not recommend for use sparingly.  And will not recommend to fellow Jewelers or artists.
1,Faulty power system. It would come back on after turning the device off .... very unnerving and frustrating ...... having to have to plug it in to use it and the unplugging it made my experience (in my location) a burden .... Raggy
1,I did not like this.  It scratches my machine and gets in the war unless you are sewing a long straight seam.  Not a fan and will prolly not use it much.  Mole skin on the machine is cheaper and better.
1,Doesn't work right. I followed the instructions, watched multiple tutorials on installing it, no matter what I do, it doesn't work. It actually moves along the fabric WORSE than my regular sewing foot. I made an oven mitt with it and using the regular foot actually worked far better. Not happy.
1,I am 21 and couldn't get it. NOT FOR CHILDREN
1,Poor assembly. Half the ear hooks are missing spring and bead before the loop.
1,This yarn was beautiful in color but the quality was horrible....so bad I'm thinking of writing to red heart.  It separated into separate strands almost through the entire skein, and I used 9 skeins out of the 10 I bought.  I would not buy this again...which is too bad because the color was really pretty!
1,I have not used these yet, but I was very disappoint in the size of it...smaller than a woodener Number 2 pencil. Maybe I missed somewhere where the size stated...because if I knew it was as small as they are I would not have purchased them. SO check the size before you buy it. otherwise, it looks as good quality and nicely made.
1,I am a decorator and doing crafts with a hot glue gun is a daily basis thing for me. I have owned a handful of brands and styles of guns. I purchased this item trusting the deWalt brand and what a disappointment. still doubtful i returned and ordered a replacement thinking it was damaged since it would not feed glue sticks properly thus keeping the FAST HEATING tip to melt the sticks. Second one was worse. Don't set urself up for disappointment. Save time and money! totally trash.
1,I realize I'm new to using this kind of thing, but in my experience: the coloured beads do not blend worth a crap. The 'Morph cools too rapidly to do anything with, and I am completely frustrated with the product.	I'm a disabled vet whose art is important in not only a creative art geek (since childhood)manner, but as a type of therapy. I used this product for the first time just two or three nights ago; and it proved so inefficient and difficult to use; I nearly went into a berserker rage. Which is something I hate happening outside of certain survival situations.	I just want to find the serenity and inner peace the late Bob Ross had, hoping art  will help and this stuff hasn't brought me one subatomic particle closer.	Your results, of course, will undoubtedly vary.	No offense meant to the manufacturer and seller(s). Maybe I'm just too far gone to use this kind of thing.
1,I read someone's review that these were not class 15; instead they are class 15J.  The description above saids it fits Singer Quantum 9960, the one I have, and they use 15J.  I need the 15, for my embroidery machine, so I'm thankful I read other buyer's reviews...Not buying these!
1,Vinyl is nearly unusable. The roll is coiled so tightly that I cannot get it to lay flat enough to feed properly in my cutter.
1,i will make a bracelet very soon but the quality of the beads are very good soon will use them to make men bracelet and so sorry for the late review the beads hole was way to small i only made one bracelet
1,horrible
1,This is unfortunately so flimsy! The handle slipped out of the head literally after using 2-3 times. Also, not heavy enough for sufficient metal stamping. Disappointed, but not just using my husbands' standard hammer for metal stamping.
1,not sure what we are even supposed to do with it
1,it  was  so  small  and it didn't  let me  get my beads  off of it  for  the money  i paid for it wasn't worth  it
1,piece of junk couldn't even get the drill bit to stay in
1,Most were cloudy, not clear quartz as shown.
1,Brought this to a needle felting class and I could not understand why my project wouldn't come together. Then I tried	Another brand of the needle. What a difference! Visually this brand of needle has such slight cuts or barbs for catching the fiber I suspect that	 is why it is worthless. The weight of this needle was very flimsy  compared to the teacher's Japanese made tool or even my Clover brand	I can't image what type of project it would be good for. Certainly not making a wool roving penguin!
1,i got these for big bottoms, i only got ONE big pink bottom and rest are random, i cannot believe they gave so few bottoms. sadddddd
1,Terrible product!  Does not work!  Very cheaply made.  This was a waste of money!
1,They are cheaply made...metal is very thin.
1,A Waste of time -- took 9 days to et them -- and money. These were THIN, light weight , if fanned, they would flop. Thinner than the	cardboard backing of my writing pad. Profoundly disappointed. They look and feel like CARDBOARD! I would have returned them but  as I waited so long to get them and my need is great, I'll use them. But will never again buy these or from this supplier.
1,Previously I reviewed and posted 5 stars for this brush case. But now that Im doing more painting, Im finding the design of a roll-up holder doesnt work well, if you need to pack and unpack brushes frequently. To secure brushes from sliding out of the case, it at first seemed wedging in as many brushes as possible into each pocket, would prevent them from sliding out. Occasionally such proved true. But more often than not, that plan doesnt work. Ive moved on and bought a zippered case and that is working much better.
1,would have preferref a picture on the front as there were no directions or guide of any kind. packaging seemed "Used"
1,It was a lovely hook with a innovative shape however it's very prone to splintering right at the top of the neck, which snags the yarn constantly. This started happening after a couple days of use and no matter how I try to sand it away, it continues to happen :(
1,the corner was crushed and that was upsetting but the big one is handy.
1,This kit did not come with any embroidery thread.  I have embroidered for MANY YEARS and this was the first time I came across this.  In the small print it is stated thread not included.  How many people would run out to find a store selling threat, not to easy these days!  As far as I am concerned this was a cheap kit never should be sold without thread, very thoughtless and stupid. Sincerely Mas
1,This was the consistency of water... and didn't perform like chalk paint at all whatsoever.  Maybe I'm just used to the folk art home decor brand now?  The home decor brand is so thick you often need to add water...  but this americana decor brand is the consistency of a sheer, very light wash. If you're looking for a very light wash with a hint of gray on bare wood it could work nicely but I imagine you would need to use several jars of this for an opaque result on a small piece of furniture.	This would probably give a nice result of a gray stain but only on bare wood.  I wouldn't expect it to cover any existing finishes.
1,I usually very happy to buy my yarn here but this specific item came to me yesterday and the colors were faded and off...
1,I thought this looked pretty, but since I started knitting with it I find the results ugly and clunky. There's something about the texture of the yarn, too, that makes it hard for me to get the tension right on my needles. I wouldn't buy this again.
1,I got the clear version, 9"x12" -- unless I'm missing something, this doesn't look self-healing to me. There are raised cuts and lines in nearly every spot I've used this mat. The surface is more rigid than rubbery, and the bottom does not have much traction, so do be careful of it sliding. The good: it has a decent grid, and a low price.
1,$7.00 for this? It's unusable. I could have cut up a child's shirt and gotten more material.	Buyer beware.
1,Didn't work and ruined what I was trying to use it on :(
1,Not as pictured very low end
1,Rubbish bristles fall out
1,How very sad this product was not to my liking and to boot I return both items with the other items I purchase and put them in one box and I have not received credit for them todate. Very SAD.
1,i don't know what to say..i am stumped~ these look like plain ole seed beads..		what a total disapointment! i would not recommend this to anyone..
1,Totally disappointed! The item i received visibly had damaged needles so I did not open or use it yet.	Maybe if simplicity would send me an undamaged item, I can make a better review...
1,The darn thing broke when I was in the middle of making a baby afghan. I had to wait for two days to get my new German metal needles. Won't buy the wood ones again.
1,Never worked right, I tried several times and it just would bunch up the fabric. Judging by the people raving about this thing I guess I got a bad one, but it certainly isn't due to lack of knowledge of sewing machines because even the cheap ones I have owned in the past work way better than this.
1,Nice try but really,you'll die of aggrevation. Great price, of course. ok for experimentation with pasta machines but you will not get a quality product from this machine. Too many problems. Appreciate the effort on the part of this company to sell an affordable pasta machine in case you don't want to make a large investment but mostly helpful for knowing what not to get and in what ways you should upgrade/invest if you're a serious artisan. Shop around
1,Unfortunately these are not so great to work with. Some fit snug others are so loose you you will surely loose your earrings. The silver part chips easily and like I said some work great other don't so I am stuck with it.
1,Most my stones were the exact same color, no variety as in the picture, all light brown tan with very little dimension to them.  And, they were not the right size. I ordered 8mm, and most were slightly smaller than my standard 6mm bead.		Had they been the colors of the picture, even if half the lot was, I would have been 5 stars, even at the smaller size.  But with the poor coloring and wrong size... hard to be positive.
1,These colors are not at all what I was expecting... They are VERY light, most of them too light to make a splash in whatever you are coloring, and they are really waxy in texture. Not Extreme at all.... boring
1,Scratchy yarn not very soft
1,Thin and flimsy should be listed as light weight tear away.  Had to use two pieces for medium weight.
1,not sure very,very tiny...useless for me with out jump rings...
1,Poor Quality and overpriced.
1,Very hard to work with and it pulls apart so easily because it is so very thing.
1,Givng a 2 star based on packaging. I think the ruler will be great. The packaging it came in was bad. Two flat pieces of cardboard taped together and one end was completely open. Suprised it did not fall out. One corner of the ruler was bent but I think I got it straightened out.
1,Brushes, even large ones, fall out. Not useful for plein air or traveling.  Best use might be to keep brushes in the studio.
1,One of the circles does not cut out completely.
1,These had about 12 defective beads w/chips or 1/2 color gone- I also got these in 6mm & loved them minus one or two so Im returning these but reordering I need both sizes foe the necklace set Im making!
1,This was obviously a return from someone else - and they didn't include all the parts plus one wooden part was broken. Amazon did it's wondrous thing and took it back. The wood was very nice and I would have loved to have been able to use.
1,didn't keep boy scout patches on the uniform, either poly or cotton shirts - had to take them to get them sewn on...
1,The tape doesn't come of with ease. - keeping using the wrong side - the correct side needs to be more defined.
1,Disappointed about this punch.
1,I thought this would stick to a stamp block but it doesn't. It's flimsy and hard to use.
1,The size was small than described. They measured 9 3/4  x 6 1/2
1,Personal experience is that these product dies frequently continue to arrive to the buyer in defective condition.  Blades are in the up position or part of the blades may be in the up position. Because of the color of the foam and the color of the blades, this is an added issue that is difficult to see and a safety hazard if a hand is placed on the blades. Accuquilt is slow to respond, if at all, to vendor returns, hoping instead the vendor will just replace the item.  Item is made in China.  Defect is not a new problem but one that is ongoing and not permanently addressed by Accuquilt.
1,This brush arrived with a bent ferrule and bristles all askew. I'll return it. I was looking for this brush as part of a materials list for an upcoming workshop. I've painted for many years and know brushes, and while Winsor & Newton is a reputable company, this was overpriced even at the Amazon discount.
1,This says in the description that it has 1.76 of each of the 5 different glitters but there's ONLY 2.4oz TOTAL  between 5 small jars...RIP OFF!!
1,These Quartz has a change in colors. They are all white now
1,Pretty dry pad. Disappointed!
1,I purchased this dress form a few months ago.  I have noticed that the more I change the sizing, the looser the form is becoming. The second half of the form has separated from the top.  When I adjust it for height, as soon as I put a garment on it, it drops down to its original position. Now I use it primarily for display purposes. I also purchased a Dritz dress form at the same time and have had much better luck with the Dritz.  I would not purchase this form again. Perhaps with very light use it would do better.
1,These spools are tiny, tiny, tiny.  Would be useful only for hand sewing -- not for use on a machine.
1,The color is the shade of teal I needed, but it is not wool, but acrylic.	My project is felted and acrylic will not work.  There was no receipt	in the package for me to return it.  I continue to save it in the wrapper	if I do receive a recept.
1,Too, too small!
1,Really did not like this hook.  Very difficult to work with. The way the tip was designed made it hard to catch the yarn. The yarn did not glide easily. Dragged.
1,This holds short and long brushes, but slightly fell apart after 1 use.  I was able to put it back together, so am still using it.  That's why the 4 star rating.	Update:  This holder completely broke a short while after purchase.  I threw it away....  Nice concept, though!
1,I purchased this pencil set after reading quite a few positive reviews.  I knew they wouldn't be the same quality as the Prismacolor Premier pencils I usually use.  Several reviews stated that these were better than Marco Raffine pencils and that the color selection was very nice.  So, I bought them to use in addition to my Prismacolors.  I also own Staedler, Marco Raffine, and Artist Loft pencils.  I have every color Prismacolor makes; but, I still look for sets to supplement the colors I have.  This Colore set does have some very nice colors including fleshtones which can be difficult to find.  Unfortunately, the pencils keep breaking when I try to sharpen them.  I've used an electric sharpener, 1 helical X-Acto sharpener, 2 different  Fiskar manual sharpeners, and my Alvin brass bullet sharpener.  I could get some of the pencils to sharpen to a point without breaking.  But, the majority of them would either break during sharpening or as soon as I tried applying them to paper.  I did try not sharpening them to a point.  But, since I am using them in adult coloring books, a point is necessary when coloring intricate details.  I also like to blend colors.  I tried several different pencil	combinations hoping that the first combination that came out awful was a fluke.  I used a Prismacolor blending pencil and a Prismacolor blending marker.  I couldn't get a smooth blend no matter what I tried.  I tried blending them on regular paper, in Johanna Basford coloring books, and in Hanna Karlzon books.  I really wanted to like these pencils.  The colors in the set are great.  I made a color chart before trying them in my coloring books.  I was really looking forward to using these.  Since others stated in their reviews that these were better than Marco Raffines, I thought they'd be ok.  But, this is just a waste of money.  I've returned the set.  I would say this set is the worst one I've purchased.
1,Don't know how to use it.  I bought a circle punch instead.  I had purchase the wrong thing.
1,After reading many reviews for the various brands of 1 inch circle punches I decided on this one for making bottle cap charms.  There was one review in particular that stood out saying that the Martha Stewart punches are supposed to be among the best (if not THE best).  That same reviewer said how that while there may be a few random bad MS punches, when you get MS they are usually good & the bad ones are usually rare.		So I ordered the MS 1 inch circle punch, it arrived in true Amazon fashion (love Prime!), & was all set up to make bottle caps with my DD.  Well, that lasted for about 2 seconds until the 1st test punch was made into a sheet of copy paper.... the smile quickly faded from our trusting faces after several more test punches & the realization that we must have received one of the rare MS punches with a burr or burrs on it.		I wasn't about to disassemble it to try & file it down as one reviewer stated they had done, but I was bound & determined to try to put a smile back on my sweet DD's face who was trying to make Christmas presents for her sisters & friends.  I closely examined & tried to feel the surface of the blade, etc. & I felt several rough spots / burrs that were causing the paper to get hung up in the punch, and would not allow it to cut completely through all around the entire circle.  It also seemed like there might have been a section that was rubbing together with the outer circle that the inner punch was pushing the paper through.		I first tried punching though aluminum foil, but that didn't work for anything (some reviewers said that would sharpen it).  After that I didn't take the punch apart, but rather I squeezed it as though I was trying to punch through some paper & I lightly sanded the actual circle part that does the punch (one reviewer said they disassembled the punch & filed down the burrs, but I wasn't going to disassemble it & then not be able to return it) & also the edge of the metal where the circle punch pushes through (not sure how to describe it).  Lightly sanding didn't help at first so I was a bit firmer.  I noticed a slight improvement in the punch & the flap that wasn't entirely cut through was getting smaller so I used a medium grit sandpaper & sanded a bit more.  VOILA!  That did the trick... my DD was soooo happy as was I knowing she was happy & would have enough time for her projects to dry in time to wrap them to give for Christmas.		We ran into an issue with some of the bottle caps not turning out as well as we wanted them to so we decided to remake some of them after looking at the them next morning once they were fully dry.  The problem came into play then when I went to use the MS punch again the next day & it was not cutting right yet again.. mind you I only cut a total of 8 circles with it through photo paper & it wasn't working again.  I lightly sanded the edges & was able to get 5 more cut out with jagged edges but the 6th one just wasn't happening.		Later that day I contacted Amazon and the punch has been returned.  I let them send me a replacement & made one punch with it through copy paper, which was fine, but I haven't yet used it on photo paper nor made a lot of punches with it, so I will update more when we do bottle cap charms rounds 3.  I'm hoping this MS punch works great & stays that way.  My advice is that if you get a bad one to start, don't try & fiddle with it.. either get a replacement sent (if from Amazon, etc. online) or go to a local store to get one you can test right away & return if it is a dud.  Don't naively wait until you must have it to find out it won't work.		Learn from my mistake, frustration, & disappointment!
1,Some of the words  where  black not white
1,way smaller than expected. I threw them out.
1,I bought Cricut brand vinyl, thinking it would be superior to anything available.  I am very disappointed.  It is extremely difficult to separate from the paper when peeling it to apply.  I am new at using vinyl with my Cricut and maybe there is a technique for doing this, of which I am not aware.  I will look for further information, but as of now, I am disappointed. I have spent a lot of money buying a variety of colors and all that I have tried to use, have been the same amount of difficulty in the application.
1,I bought this because it was raved about on HSN. The zipper sticks, the plastic inserts are cheaply made and for the price...not worth it. Save your money and buy something else.
1,I am very disappointed with these blades.  It is not nearly as sharp as it was advertised to be.  The first time I used it it did not cut cleanly thru silk ties I was trimming.  I will not buy these again.  When I bought it I saw a guarantee that if it was not as sharp as advertised, then the seller would send one Olfa blade.  I no longer see that listed on the product but if I could do it again, I would have purchased the Olfa blade instead.  The old saying comes to mind, "You get what you pay for".  I think the best deal is to look for the Olfa blades at Joanne Fabrics, or use a coupon if it is not on sale there.
1,I have purchased the smaller packet and they were great,ho,I decided to purchase  the 100 pack and 3-4 of the clips have broken. I wasted money thinking I was saving by purchasing in large volume,a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.		QUALITY IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN QUANTITY..
1,This is my first time using an even feed walking foot and so far it is great. I am looking forward to using it with several layers to see if everything ends up even, I haven't gotten there with this quilt yet. I will repost if I am disappointed but I don't expect to be. It was easy to put on and the price was great compared to others I looked at. Time will tell on how it holds up.		An update on this item, it held up for less than two weeks. My dad always told me you get what you pay for. I bought the Janome even feed walking foot to replace it and I am very pleased with the way it is working for me.
1,Description said 364 yard., What I received is 235 yards this is not what I paid for
1,Thought this was all colors. When it came in they were all white. Not happy
1,Spool is tiny. Only worth a dollar
1,Too heavy, even when I removed the mysterious ceramic dish.  No chart for the colors.  Uncertain quality of colors.  It's not that small... certainly does NOT fit in a pocket.  I have palettes half the size that I would call "small".
1,I just don't like this container.  You have to use it from the start of the project or when you join yarns.  I will stick with my ziplock freezer bags for holding the yarn while I relax and knit.  Also, I thought it was awkward to carry about.  Like my subject line, this is probably a great project, just not for me.
1,To stretchy. Needed a firmer pull strength.
1,As a jewelry maker, sometimes you see something like this and when you get it, it falls way short of expectation and useability. It's one sided. So anything that requires a mirror image line earrings is out of the question. I can't even resell these at a yard sale for 25 cents.  GARBAGE.
1,The soft version of this clay is VERY soft and oily. I really can't use it. Maybe it is for people working on a large scale. It seems unusable for small scale projects. I am going to stick with cleaner plasticine type clay.
1,It says it works on felt. It does not. I purchased it for felt. But it just kept getting jammed. I had to return it. I wanted to make my own diffuser replacement pads.
1,This product is a great idea! But it is not very sharp. Having trouble with punching all weights of paper.
1,Will not use them on crystal jewelry, not strong enough
1,Missing parts so unable to assemble
1,This formulation is like the fabric mod podge and it just never really dries. It stays tacky. It has a bit of a tint similar to the antique mod podge.
1,Worst pens ever! They do not work at all. I've tried different types of paper some with texture some without.  You have to press into the paper to see just a little speck of ink come out and then your paper/project is ruined.  You want a good white ink pen try a Uni-ball Signo!!
1,product does NOT look as white as picture, more tan and folded so small I have to iron before using
1,when I went to use this stuff, the aerosol cap blew off, and the can was just open and spewing air and glitter out into my room!!! I had to run outside with it, and althought I put the cap and lid back on, it kept spewing, and even blew the caps both back off...this happened with ALL 3 of the Glitter Blast colors I ordered!!!
1,I've been painting for 18 years, and can say when you get a GOOD version of this brush type, it will be the best brush you've ever owned. However, of the last three purchases of this brush, two of them have been poorly made. A brush should not splay and fishtail on day-1 of use (and this is with highly diluted acrylic paints mind you). Due to the extremely poor quality control at Winsor & Newton, I will permanently be switching to the Raphael 8404 brush series.		If you opt to buy one of these brushes, be prepared to make returns until you receive one in good condition.
1,This hoop is hard to tighten because the screw is straight -- does not lift up like the original Brother hoop.  Doesn't seem to be very good quality.
1,I am not a novice when it comes to yarn winders. This one is the worst one I have ever used.		Flimsy construction		Parts scratched and rubbed against the base of the yarn "cone" when winding.		The clamp is a very odd design. The plate is short, and has a stop on, so it only grips the edge of the surface you are attaching it to. This means it doesn't really get a good purchase on it, and therefore works itself loose, no matter how tightly you screw it.		Despite saying "large", it does not allow you to wind a decent sized ball. It constantly wants to add the yarn in a way that it starts to fall off the ball.	Also, the ball looks very untidy when finished. Looks like a toddler has attempted to wind it.		This is NOT user error, I am no novice to yarn winders.		There is a small sticker attempting to cover a rather large hole between the handle and the base clamp. it barely covers it.		The cone has burrs on the flange that attaches to the base, and it is difficult to seat the thing in the holes. I had to try three or four times each time I removed the "cone" to replace it to get it flat.		On the whole, I would rather wind yarn by hand. I wouldn't give this product burning space.		I am being very generous giving this product 1 star.
1,I couldn't find Red Heart Super Saver Yarn in Antique anywhere except on Amazon.  I needed one skein.  I'd been looking for Antique at stores & online for a couple of months & could only find it on Amazon.  It cost $9.51 from this seller w/ an Amazon discount of $.36.  So, I paid $9.15 for one skein.  I had been looking so long that I decided to bite the bullet & purchase it.  I pulled an end from the center of the skein so I could wind the yarn into a ball.  After only about 1 1/2 ft, the yarn tugged.  Oh Oh!!  I reached into the middle of the skein & found a knot w/ the other loose end knotted all up in it.  The yarn was twisted & knotted around itself throughout the entire skein.  It took me almost 4 hours to unknot it, cut out the knots where loose ends had been sloppily joined, & wrap it into a ball. I had to weave the small ball of yarn I had started through, into, around, & over constantly.  I have NEVER seen such a mess.  There were 5 sloppily tied knots where the yarn had broken & the ends retied.  I've purchased other Red Heart Yarns that occasionally have 1 or even 2 small knots in it where the ends had been retied.  I don't appreciate it because I feel yarn should be wound in one continuous skein w/o joined ends in the yarn.  To me, if the yarn has to be tied together due to broken ends, it should be sold as seconds.  I don't think they have machines that retie the broken ends.  I could be wrong; but, it seems unlikely.  That means that someone had to see how many breaks there were in this skein.  The yarn should have been discarded as too defective.  I have NEVER had to fix more than 2 knots in a skein until I got this one.  I usually buy yarn ahead. So I'm not apt to unravel the skein from the center & wind it back into a ball for a while.  But, I really wanted to see what this yarn looked like knitted.  FYI:  The colors in Antique knit up beautifully.  I did think that this yarn was burgundy/teal/white/soft grey/soft black.  The part I though was grey is actual a soft taupe.  The part I thought was black is a really deep, almost black, chocolate.  I found this yarn in a store about a week later for $2.59 a skein.  Yeah, I paid over $9.00 & don't appreciate being gouged.  Since I had already unknotted the skein, dealt w/ the loose ends that had been sloppily tied, & knitted the gloves; I couldn't return the skein.  Had I found the yarn at the craft store before I had made the gloves, I would have put the knotted mess in a bag & returned it.  But, you know how it is when you really want to make something w/ a specific yarn.  Still, I can't believe that someone would charge $9.51 for a skein that was an obvious second (defective).  This was my first purchase from The BT Group.  I see many positive reviews & purchased this based on those glowing reviews.  I thought this yarn had been discontinued & really wanted it.  So, I was willing to pay more.  I did not expect such poor quality control.  I'm not sure I'd trust this seller again.  Honestly, this was not acceptable.  I could have taken the wrapper from the defective yarn, placed it on one of the new skeins I'd bought for so much less, & returned it to Amazon for a refund.  But, I am an honest person & just couldn't do that.  All I can do is warn others that when you purchase from this seller, you may be spending money on defective merchandise.
1,color is much lighter than it appears online and when order arrived the one skein was frayed and unusable
1,I used it in a couple of casting and found it to be cloudy, I might need to experiment with it more, but out of the box I was not getting the results I wanted.
1,they are not different sizes and if your ring is just  a little lose  that  putting one of these big fat  snuggies on will be so uncomfortable to leave on my ring, it is  3/8 of an inch in diameter each side and the hole are each 1/8 of an inch so 3X1/8 is 3/8 and yes I did measure  so if your smart don't go with these.........	I plan on  doing some clear silicone caulking to make a little dab around my ring that will be good after it drys then I can still wear my blackhills gold pinky ring  and know it will stay on and  I won't have to have that big 3/8 "  in my way....
1,These seem fine for the price except for one thing: No protective cover? I planned to put a blade in the handle and keep this little knife on my crafting table in a can with my scissors and pliers and a couple pens, like my boyfriend does with his Exacto knife, but I can't do that and it's extremely inconvenient.		I feel like selling this product without a cap to go over it (like the Exacto knives have) is like selling a freakin' pen without a cap. Totally ridiculous.
1,I'm a big fan of Fiskars scissors, but these are a disappointment.  The sharpness is okay, but the orange locking button continually gets stuck in lock position while I'm cutting...that's hugely annoying.
1,This thread is already in the bottom of our sewing drawer.  We cannot find a use ... golden just does not work with out jeans.
1,My machine already broke less than a year from moderate use. I didn't expect this to happen. The bobbin thread no longer catches. Now, I have to pay to have it repaired because I didn't get insurance. If you can invest in a more expensive machine.
1,It drops orange bristles on your project.
1,Colors are messy! Waste of money!
1,The glossy accents works great but Ive now tried two bottles of the matte medium and the tips are simply too fine to use with this product. You will not be able to use the tip that comes in this with the matte medium period. I struggled for 2 hours with the help of my husband, the tip is not clogged it is just simply too thick.
1,Broken
1,Sad to say, did not work at all for the person intended. She had better luck rolling up some of the Xyron glue bits and using that to get up the rest of the glue. This just smears the glue over the photos or paper. (I tried it myself with the same results) Glad it works for others, but I thought I should let others know it doesn't work for everyone.
1,Don't bother with these, because they clog shut every time- even with the pin inside.
1,least favorite orange neon.  i like roseart neon colors best
1,I wanted to love this, but it was SO frustrating I returned it. I purchased this for the main purpose of creating professional quality glossy white vinyl decal stickers featuring my own artwork. It seems that this is the one thing it truly CAN NOT do. The Print and Cut features only work on matte papers and matte vinyl. It can't even be luster or slightly shiny! For resale, I don't find matte stickers appealing. I tried every cheat and trick I came across online but stickers still either came out misaligned or the machine refused to cut entirely. The scanner doesn't work with gloss because of the reflective qualities so it can't see the cut lines.		A few other cons that ultimately lead to my return of this product. So not only did it not work for what I wanted to make, the machine and online design studio only allow for a cut area of 6 inches by 9 inches! Now, if you're buying expensive sticker paper or vinyl it probably comes in 8.5x11" and everything outside 6"x9" is waste. I have NO idea why this is, since the machine can accommodate a 12"x12" mat just fine.		Another huge con is the machine constantly loses connection to the design studio- both while using bluetooth and USB connection. I have to refresh, disconnect, turn off, restart over and over to get it to see the connection again.		The machine can't cut without THE INTERNET. Now, if you have a spotty connection like I do, this is SO aggravating especially on top of the connectivity issues it already has, as mentioned above. You can only cut from the Cricut ONLINE design center and you can't do it offline or by simply just downloading software.		So final thoughts, aesthetically it looks adorable and it cuts really well! It just doesn't meet ANY of my other needs. I was SO excited when I got this but spent 3 or 4 whole days fighting with it and wasting tons of expensive papers only to be left with nothing to show for. I'm returning it to try the Silhouette Cameo 3. I've heard it might be able to do what I need. We'll see how it goes!
1,Broke the first time I used it.  The only one of the three parts I needed, the wire part for small needles, broke almost immediately.  I'd return it but who has time to bother with such a small item?  Don't waste the extra money.  Go with the regular cheap metal threaders that also break in a few uses.  They really don't make things like they used to.
1,color doesn't stay. bleeds and stains everything else. had to toss clothes i dyed.
1,I purchased these because of the small size and it would be easy to measure the amount I use to make soaps. Like some have said there's didn't smell good - that wasn't the case with the ones I received - no bad smells, great bars of soap.		Update: I've changed from 5 to 2 starts because I purchased this a second time and the smell was horrible, even before I opened the box. Very smokey! I believe they have to use smokers when harvesting honey? so I guess I might understand a small smell (which my first order had no odor) but this was horrible. I had to throw it out and get refunded. I may try buying again though as I'm sure small amounts of a smokey odor would be natural. I will update my review again after the next purchase and see what happens.
1,adhesive is good. dispensor doesn't work well
1,Kingso polyester sewing threads were thin and easily broke. Other reviewers said theirs broke during sewing or worse, broke after they made an article and it fell apart. Sadly we had not read the reviews before buying these thread packages. But we tested the strength and "feel" of a couple on arrival and sure enough, they were weak, frizzy and broke right apart so we returned them immediately.  Recommend: Do not buy this. In contrast, we did buy another "national name brand" C&C thread product also sold on Amazon and those threads are perfect, strong, resilient, not "fuzzy," and will last decades in anything we sew in them -- as good threads should do!		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/KINGSO-24-Assorted-Colors-Polyester-Sewing-Thread-Spool-1000-Yards-Each/dp/B018282FAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">KINGSO 24 Assorted Colors Polyester Sewing Thread Spool 1000 Yards Each</a>
1,These are not genuine Singer bobbins. Made in China from flimsy, thin, cheap plastic. Save your money. Spend a little more and get the real thing. These did not fit my machine, which requires a 15J bobbin
1,I returned the pastels because the packaging was inadequate to protect the pastels.  The interior of the wrapping was covered with chalk dust and when I opened the box, almost all of the chalks were broken.  Sorry, but when I pay $75 for something I don't want it broken.  Thank goodness Amazon has a buyer protection plan!
1,Did not stay together, handle pulled out
1,I ADE CARDS FOR A LIVING AND THEIS PAPER WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY OF THE FIVE GLUES  I TRIED.  THE PAPER LOOKS VERY PRETTY AND COMES IN SOME RATHER UNUSUAL COLORS, BUT FROM PAPER/RUBBER CEMENT TO OTHER CRAFT	GLUES, IT JUST BUCKLED UP AND WAS USELSS!
1,Love all the Housemouse stamps.  They make me smile.
1,No matter how carefully one holds the paper being punched, because it if held vertical rather than laying flat, it is very difficult to keep it level in the machine and awkward reaching around the paper to push down the lever to punch the holes.  It is difficult on larger projects (like 8 1/2 x 11) to center the holes and keep them straight from one set of paper to the next.  In the end it caused me to ruin two Christmas presents for my grandchildren and almost a birthday present for my sister.  I returned it and though it is more expensive, I bought a Cinch instead, the paper lays flat in the machine and keeping the holes being punched in the same line and configuration from the cover-stock to the paper for the pages inside.
1,The title says it all. The product is fine but this seller didn't bother to ship the item until a WEEK after I had placed the order.
1,I was so disappointed I was expecting some cone shaped bead caps and all I got were regular bead caps 3 styles/sizes in silver and 3 gold caps.  They are definitely not delivering what they are marketing in that picture.
1,This is false advertising.  The regular price on this size Texture Magic is NOT $23, which leads the buyer into thinking they're getting a great discounted deal.  The regular price is within a few cents of what this is being sold for.  Come on Amazon.  You're better than that!
1,This paint is super thin and needs too many coats.
1,Have ordered & used numerous refills and have been very pleased.  Just used a new refill and within 5 minutes of use, it has doubled up & kinked.  Not happy.  Waste of $9.  Hopefully this is a rare situation but not pleased at all.		Update - changed my rating from 2 stars to 1.  As previously mentioned, I've been using this product for quite awhile and been pleased,  Not sure if this is a new version but it's terrible.  Constantly pulls up i.e. rips the card stock and damages my work.  Although its indicated that I'm buying the stuff I've always bought, the recent refills are crap.		Update #2 - Still going through the supply I purchased and my review hasn't changed.  Total crap product and doesn't appear there is any customer service that stands by it.  Tired of getting less than 1/2 of the product before it gets tangled.  Hasn't always been like that but quality has GREATLY diminished!  Disappointing.  Save your money - particularly since there isn't any customer service to stand behind the inferior product.
1,These jump rings turn black from one day to another. they loose the gold plated and turn black very quickly.
1,On the up side - as an add-on item, this kit only costs $3.66 right now.  The quilling paper is worth that.  After doing the snowflakes (which were wonderful!), I wanted to try this.  The generic directions for the quilling shapes (which were the same directions in the snowflake package) were fine.  But the directions for the angels were not good at all.  Unlike the snowflakes, the diagrams of the angles DO NOT include the individual pieces of quilled work that make them up.  I made the one that is in the middle of the bottom row (although the directions said to use blue, not red), and I really struggled with the skirt.  The directions do not tell you how many pieces (in this case marquises) are to be used.  I just tried to fill in the skirt outline which was on the directions.  The directions should be organized better - listing each angle separately.  Detailed outlines of the quilled pieces should be included for the entirety of the sketch to provide direction.  If a piece uses marquises, then the number should be provided.  The directions are jumbled like someone was trying to save paper rather than trying to be clear.
1,I bought this Clover Small Pom Pom Maker and have tried and tried to make poms. Maybe I am still doing it wrong, but this little thing is not helping me.
1,This advertises as cork. It is not it is just pressed cardboard.  They where cheap and came from so far just kept them and will make it work for another project. If you want cork coasters better off going to the store and finding then.
1,Can't give a review on this product.  It was lost in the mail.  the replacement machine was wonderful.
1,When I purchased these two skeins of yarn I was under the impression that the price stated was for the 14 oz size per skein not the 7 oz for the same price.  I was excited that there would be no fee for shipping and handling but upon receiving the product I was disappointed to get something that I could go to Wal-mart for a pay only $2.77/skein.
1,These pens are a disappointment. The tip sizes are nice but...the liquid only comes out on part of the bigger tip and almost none comes out on the smaller tip.  To use  the bigger tip the point has to be rotated to find the sweet spot where the liquid comes out.  These markers are only used for coloring books, but had looked forward to using all of the colors.  Hasn't happened.
1,If a one star didn't use the word "hate" that would have been my rating.  This is my third Brother purchase and I can't say how disappointed I am.  I realize this isn't a high end machine but a person still expects value for their money.  The machine is quite noisy but that I could live with.  The design of the machine and the assembly are my main complaints.  I had to get my husband to bring his tools to help me change the needle, the holding screw was in so tight.  After quite an ordeal he managed to get it free.  Cleaning the lint from the machine turns into a major overhaul of the product.  There are two screws holding the plate which I also had to get husband's help getting loose.  This machine does not include the usual little white handled screwdriver but a ridiculous little piece of medal about 1" in size that is totally useless.  I'm very sorry I purchased this machine but was judging by my past experience with the Brother line, I've been very happy with my other two machines.  I don't think it necessarily is the price because one of my other Brother machines was purchased for an under $100 range, I just think this is a poorly designed machine.  Definitely would not recommend this model.
1,The painted desert yarn  is very thin and texture is rough i have used red heart many years and haven't had this problem
1,This maybe ok paper but the maker has some really bad quality control. The pad I got has some pretty bad issues. 1: there seems to be roller indents through out the whole middle of each sheet of paper so the paper is not smooth or flat making it so I can't really use the full size of the paper unless I went indents through the drawing, I'll have to cut the indents out of each sheet I use with leaves it at odd sizes. 2: some of the pad is a bit wavy (1/4 of the pad)  in areas outside  of the roller indent through the middle. 3: the bottom of the sheets was not cut correctly about 1/3 of the pad has a ridge pattern at the end instead of being a strait cut. 4: the sheets are rather thin, around  the thickness of printer paper so if your looking for thinker marker paper I'd look for something else.
1,These are to thick and uncomfortable on your finger. :(
1,Very light weight. To light to be usueful. Dont Buy.
1,This is the first spellbinder I've given a horrible review to. This one was poorly made and does not cut through paper or card stock - it came dull. So disappointing and unusual for all of the others I've bought. It's gorgeous, wish it cut all the way through :(
1,not pink and white as pictured. Not sharp at the tips.
1,Too expensive for a product that streaked so badly on my application.  Perhaps I was not using it appropriately, but I'll buy a spray next time.
1,Damaged. Packaging was perfect.
1,Too fragile, arrived damaged - will be returning it for a refund since the quality is just terrible and either will arrive damaged again or break with touch.
1,Useless for what I wanted, they look cheap on the bracelets
1,Metal is so soft that several of the flat blades bent significantly just trying to shave off thin edge of a new micro-crystalline wax block. One more bend and they will fail. Tapered necks are poorly designed and way too thin. For the cost as an Amazon add-on item (<$8) I didn't expect too much... but I did expect to get a little longer use than I anticipate I will actually get. These are not in any way strong like dental picks. They are made in India. They will work on soft/ leather hard ceramics... I would personally not purchase again... Of the 24 tips on 12 tools... I can see that with care several of them will last making this a reasonable purchase for a very careful craftsman
1,These included gold and SILVER so if you are looking for just gold buttons go elsewhere.	Also, the assortment is terrible, there are maybe 6 different styles, just in different sizes or colors.
1,If you're like me you like your watercolor paper crisp white, sturdy, and "fixed."  I feel like the paper I received from Amazon has been in the warehouse for a long time!  The white is still white but the "gummed" side is dried out so the pages are not adhered to each other and the stiff backing slips and slides around.  (I have purchased this before and it's not the brand!)	Since I'm fortunate enough to live within walking distance of a Dick Blick store I'll just buy all my paper in person.  There was no price advantage to buying this through Amazon and I was just being lazy having the paper delivered.	You would do as well buying separate sheets or paying more for a definitely watercolor block.
1,Really pretty unhappy with the brush.  Tended to split right away.  After talking with other painters, Winsor Newton 7's may have a quality control issue.  Some are very good, but some are just junk.  My offbrand cheap Walmart brushes were better.  I picked up a Rosemary & Co brush for about 1/2 the price and it was so, so, so much better.
1,The concept is a good idea but the pockets are not all the same size.  Also it can't hold all brands.  I did find that if I only put one part of the folders in and let the second side hang out it could work but you have to be very careful to not damage your folders or the sleeves opening and closing the pages.
1,Does not say Chibi. Not as pictured.
1,These scissors are for the birds!  They barely cut through 1 layer of fusible fleece, cannot get through two.  Only good to cut a single layer of non interfaced fabric, it can't even handle two layers without bending and snagging.  I sew bags, all fabric is interfaced.  These scissors used to work amazing.  I lost my pair in traveling, so I ordered two new pairs.  Well something changed...just like their machines.  They are junk now!
1,Yarn is good quality, but from the photo I thought the platoon is white, grey, and black. Instead the coloring was in the beige and brown family.
1,The quality is fine but I wanted metallic and it just looks grey in person. It's not shiny silver looking like the photo.
1,Exactly what I need, and the additional smaller hook is perfect for tying off and pulling tags into the stitches.		Well, this is an updated review.  The original hooks were smooth and round the full length.  These new crochet hooks have and indention on both sides about two inches from the tip of the hook.  The picture does not show this.  The indention is a little sharp on the edges.  They are very uncomfortable to use.  These are being returned.
1,This compound creates far too much foam even in very small doses. Foam is a bad thing with stainless steel media in a vortex tumbler.
1,Junk. Doesn't bond any materials it says it will.
1,Powdery, dries like chalk, chips after it dries. All together disappointing.
1,This is beautiful yarn at a really horrible price.  For $7+ I thought I was getting three skeins and it even said that in the description (or so I thought).  Alas, no.  So the yarn is nice, the price is not.  Don't be fooled.
1,Cute for decorations; but don't ring or make any noise except rattling.  Bad buy.  Need tiny bells; but maybe they don't even exist.  I'll buy squeakers instead..
1,MATERIAL DOES NOT CUT THAT GOOD.
1,I purchased this because I needed to make some items that were larger than the small normal ones for bracelets, etc.  I have yet to be able to get the warps to stay in place.  Even though I got the tension correct to begin with, the threads move.  I have tried everything.  The tension doesn't stay tight on the adjustments, and you have to constantly try and tighten them up.  I have tried three times to work on this loom, and everytime, the warp threads have moved, and ruined the project.  I might try again in a month or so, but right now, I don't think it was worth the money.  Very poor instructions too.
1,The needle broke the first time I used it. I would suggest getting needles from another supplier cause these seem to break easy. Otherwise the tool its self is easy to hold and comfortable.
1,I bought this for needle punch work. I really hoped it would hold my work as well as a gripper frame. Not even close. I was hoping as the Morgans come in a variety if sizes. Maybe for embroidery it would be ok, but I do NOT like it for needle punch.
1,Love that it is precut BUT beware of  poor instructions and poor quality material. Colors in picture look like batiks but are not!!
1,Waste of money. Use an unsharpened pencil. Eraser side does the same thing for pennies. What a waste. Also... a description of what it does would help on the site.
1,Maybe i don't know how to use it. I don't like
1,I guess I didn't read the description correctly. There is not enough of any color to make anything except for maybe a flower	For a hat decoration.	 the colors and quality of the yarn is good.
1,For years I had Dritz products that were well made, but this one is not.  The magnifying glass (plastic, really) arrived scratched and with thumb smudges from the factory employees on it (!).  The threading end does not fit or lock into the handle when removed from the handle. As a resukt if this poor design, you are left with a tiby blue nub even smaller to hold than the traditional metal "coin" ones.  I wound up gluing it permanently to the magnifying glass handle to have something to grasp.  Dritz has a vote if no confidence from me.  No compensation for this review.
1,Great if you need to protect the corners of a mach box
1,I bought this on Janyary 27 and March 14 it quit working.  I bought this one because the one I had before quit working.  Never buy this again
1,Item shown is not the item I received!.  Pictured/described is a 5.5" long plier, with 2-tone ergonomic handle, and rounded edges on the tool.	What I got, was a 5" long plier, with solid black - Non-ergonomic handle, squared off edges, and just a generally inferior looking product. I would never have paid this much for this tool, as I can get this kind of quality cheaper, locally. I got this to give as a Christmas gift, and won't be giving it now. Not cool!
1,This is the absolute worst.  Sticky water with a slight yellowish color (if you look at a puddle of it).  This won't work for anyone, no matter what color your hair is.  No wonder there's not even a brand name on it.  We bought 2 cans, and it was like throwing money in the trash.  Luckily, we found a year-old half-used bottle of the Snazaroo brand yellow hairspray - a year old and half-used, and it worked.  My son's dark hair coated banana-yellow for his Ed Elric costume.  Next year, we'll plan ahead better.
1,It doesn't extend for any length of time that matched the required effort to mix it.
1,By the time I opened the package and read the instructions I had already broken a magnet.  Bigger warning on package would be great.
1,Only cuts part of the circle!  I have tried this on several different paper weights.  On close examination one can see the cutting "blade" does not close properly.  Hoping I can return this for a working punch!
1,This was not a worthwhile buy.  As an experienced glass cutter, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the score line.  I will not buy this product again.  The only reason it got even 2 stars was I may still try taking off the cutting wheel that came with it and replacing it with another brand.
1,Misleading title. I didn't  read the reviews.
1,Look closely at the fine print/weight/size of beads.  Poor selection, dusty beads, and you don't get anywhere near as many as the picture shows.
1,Break too quickly for titanium
1,Tiny and no branch!  Rip off!
1,Haven't used this product very much yet but some of the plastic closure was broken off. Still useable but not terribly impresses with it.
1,The netting is bigger/looser than I expected.  I double wrap most of the time.  I will not reorder this.
1,Crap.  Looks terrible when inked.
1,I should have bought the refurbished one for $40.00. This one doesn't deserve my payment. It is slow, dragging, entangles, and overall... poor in performance.
1,I like this
1,When I received this, I was expecting more than just one (1) in the package, as when I looked at the picture, there was more than just one (1) in the package.
1,these are very nice because they are thick, but the only bad thing is that they are not point enough to get into the thicker fabrics or the semi thick fabric.
1,Well made, but much larger and heavier than I was expecting.  Not what I was looking for.
1,Completely useless. Did not work as advertised. Would have returned but threw away in disgust first.
1,they do not lite or burn well very disapointed
1,not very sharp but works on thin paper
1,It's OK, but the bottle is SO tiny, that I am not even sure what I will use it for. I guess. 2oz? Not sure about that.
1,These bobbins don't work in my machine even though the description says they would. I was issued a prompt refund. A+ for seller but the bobbins were worthless to me.
1,Not real suede. Waste of money
1,This item did not fit my sewing machines, I was very disappointed.  I have bought many feet thru amazon and have been very happy with them, but this one did not work.  Before you buy make sure you measure your machine to fit a low shank foot.  I wanted something easier to attach to my machine that is narrow.  The zipper feet you get with your machines now days are very wide and don't get close enough to your projects.  This would have been nice if it would have fit.
1,The Ink had dried up. Not useful
1,Didnt stay on
1,They did stick
1,GOOD FOR HOBBY BUT NOT FOR BIGGER VINYL CUTTERS
1,Product arrived melted! The white pencil was missing
1,These eyes were about 3 mm and not the 12 mm described and that I needed. I sent them back.
1,I bought these to punch holes in fabric. Nothing on Amazon said these were not appropriate tools for this use. After six or so holes, I have two tools that are hopelessly twisted out of shape, so the hammer doesn't hit the cutter at all. Useless for fabric.
1,Theoretically these could be used for crafts, but they don't cut much more than paper and cardboard. Will not cut fabric. Don't buy them if you want useful scissors
1,very hard to use not enough room between needle and body of machine for bulky items foe sale to highest bidder went back to my brother
1,Seam on side. Garbage ! It had a scene running down the side. Its basically worthless.
1,Not the quality product I like to work with
1,This yarn is probably fine for kids' craft projects and maybe some lessons in the most basic of knitting or crochet stitches, but it was a poor choice for crocheting a hat. It's not soft at all, and it's so very inelastic. Even having made my gauge swatch, I ended up with a hat that was too big simply because the ribbing didn't hug in like it was supposed to. It stayed stiff and extended. I made the exact same pattern with an alpaca yarn and it came out beautifully, but the hat from this yarn I'll chalk up to a learning experience.
1,Terrible quality. It is so poorly made that it has sharp edges and rust. The metal inserts are not even cut properly so they are unusable. Im returning it
1,Too small and very little. And not too pretty images i got alot of moths wich i hate
1,I generally read the reviews and failed on this one.  Wish I had read them... As a former school teacher, I am accustomed to construction paper being a heavier weight - won't flop over when holding it in your hand.  While the colors are pretty, the weight of the paper is too lightweight for the projects I had purchased this for.  Plus, the white construction paper in the back is no heavier than computer copier paper!  Very disappointed. Would consider sending back, but the plastic wrap around the paper was totally off inside the shipping box!
1,I ordered based on color and description. Opened the shipping box to discover that the photo had been heavily edited; what I received was a dingy ugly color that you *might* call bronze if you were being particularly generous - but not what I need for my project. Return label already printed, off to UPS I go!
1,too easy to break.
1,I find that water brushes are hard for me to control the amount of water I want with each stroke. Sometimes I want intense color and tad of water others a watery wash. I would rather use a dry brush and pick up the amount of water needed. I realize when you travel this might be a nice way to tote water but a plastic jar with a lid does the trick too and is more versatile. Guess it just didn't work for my style of painting but everyone has different approaches, you may love water brushes and I think this is a good one.
1,This is an okay product, but be warned:	1) The stickers are VERY small	2)They are in a foreign language	3) They are cute, but don't have a real function	4) You only get a few sheets, but they really aren't worth the money		I do not recommend this product.
1,They did not last any longer than the regular blades.  started skipping after a short period of cutting use.
1,I did not care for this. For me it was easier to use my finger exacto knife. I guess it has a learning curve that takes longer to use than my knife.
1,Crap.	Cheap.	Didn't work AT ALL.
1,Hate it!!!  Hate it!!!  Too small, not as described....very tiny, too tiny for the project that I wanted it for.  Bad description; would not order again.  No use for this.
1,They broke within a couple months. Waste of money. Would have bought metal ones from the start.
1,I am a Prime customer because when I need emergency hair bow supplys I know I can get them fast (can't find quality solid grosgrain locally) while I am waiting on my larger orders to come in from those who only deal in these supplies. I love HipGirl ribbon & their web page but I for those who are desperate or new to the hairbow business are being cheated. With just 2 yards per color, you are lucky if there is enough of the color to make a topper & spikes for a stacked boutique bow. Cost per in is disturbing.
1,Nothing as described. Elegant flowers?  More like elegant, blocky shapes.  Thick, gloppy paint.  Thinning it out only made it transparent.  More for a beginner.
1,The preforation teeth were too big and I had to go over the paper more than once to actually get it to tear making it very uneven and unclean looking.
1,Hard to work with.  Too stiff.
1,These are just ok. I wouldnt buy them again. They are a bit too translucent for my needs. And they don't work every time. Some work better than others and I ended up using my chalk markers after getting frustrated with these markers to finish the job.
1,What can I say.  These are made in China and made with cheap materials, but they will work fine for carving candles and soft materials.  A good value for the money.  The will rust if allowed to get wet.
1,It's much more watering than I had assumed. You need several layers to get any necessary consistency. I think they need to modify the formula.
1,The Huion L4S Light Box is a bit of a disappointment to say the least.	The light is very uneven, large areas of dark and light streaks.	Its also not very bright, even on a 2+ amp USB supply.  Im not very impressed at all.		The uneven lighting might not be an issue for some but for me, its everything.	It makes this light panel useless for me!		The only good I can see is that its large and was packed very well.  If the lighting was even, it would have been perfect.
1,I realize that ordering yarn online means there may be some color variation from what I see on the screen. I also realize a yarn called "pumpkin" should be on the orange side. This yarn appeared to have more of a yellow tint online and it is nothing short of neon orange! I ordered this along with another color that showed up as a very green color, nothing like what I expected, and now I have neon orange and green for a project I was really looking forward to...
1,Did not work as i thought it would.  I am a model airplane builder and this does not fit my needs as I thought it would.  I probably need to learn how to use it though.
1,Cricut has decided that you are to be cartridged bound.  Personally,  I find this very limiting and expensive as it will require you to continue to buy new cartridges all the time.  Sadly this is what Provo Craft is wanting.  There was third party software companies that allowed you to create your own images and creations.  Provo Craft has begun suing these companies.  A machine with so much potential and options gets very limited very quickly when you are forced to to use only cartridges all the time.  For my money I will focus on a cutter that does not require cartridges and will allow me to make my own designs.		In my eyes Cricut has potential but the company is choosing to limit the product.
1,Sent these back. The little wheels that are supposed to tell you which row you are on didn't stay put. They spun freely.  Also, the workmanship was crap. They're garbage. Don't waste your money.
1,Came with hardly ANY instructions on how to USE it...
1,The quality of these items is seriously lacking.  I know!  They were inexpensive.  Serves me right... the product is cheap.  They also took forever to arrive.  Don't bother with these.  They look like would come in a child's toy set.
1,I don't like how the jump rings are shaped the ends overlap in a circle.
1,Too weak, after a medium-ish amount of water (that Canson and Arches handles just fine) it warps and then permanently stays warped. It would work better as textured dry medium paper, or markers would be fine.
1,The top looks OK.  The roll feature works.  The feet fit on the machine OK,  The channel on the underside for the rolled hem does not go all the way to the back of the foot.  The net result is that the rolled hem lifts the foot such that the feed dogs won't move the cloth under the foot smoothly.  On the other hand the price was too good to be true.
1,Zippers were broken
1,Opened package to find yarn had been cut in several places
1,Ordered several.  All but one have been fine.  One bottle worked like crackle gel without applying crackle gel under the paint.  This means the paint was short on binder.  You can use it but you have to add gel medium to it .. So just be aware if you get this & one does this.  The ones that worked were fine!
1,I received these pencils, I love the colors but unfortunately the tips started crumbling, and they are hard to sharpen without your pencil getting eaten up. Not happy with them.
1,I ordered the 30 color paint set. My box showed I should have metallic paints there are none, my paints look nothing like any of the pictures, after doing a color chart and trying to paint 1painting I found grit in some of my colors about 0.5 mm in diameter. I have had better quality paints from much cheaper non professional paints such as Crayola.
1,The color light fastness ratings are excellent and they go on like butter...however they are are VERY dusty and you must be very careful the dust doesn't ruin your artwork.  Once this problem is looked into I'll buy them all...but not until then,  I think the tools need to be refined too.  Esp to handle small and precise application of this medium.
1,This has a "keyring" attachment not so good for smaller zippers.
1,Doesn't have enough cleaning power.
1,does not flow smoothly
1,This is ALOT bigger than what the picture portray it to be
1,This case might be useful for something, but not circular needles, unless they are very small.  Made well and has a good closure but my circulars will not fit in easily.  Needs larger pockets.	But, I will use for something.  Price was right
1,They are all the same size...I assumed it was a variety of sizes
1,Cords are horrendous, gave the set away.
1,The sleeves fit so tightly on the yarn that it is impossible to pull the yarn out as you work.  Don't recommend this for use while knitting or crocheting.  If your need is just to store your yarn, this might work for you.
1,Very low quality beeds
1,My mom bought me a set of the Holbein's. (for my Birthday) I can't believe that some of the pencils just crumble. ( very dried up inside) Just wanted to give you all a heads up on them. I did write to them and they told me to contact the person I bought them from. I would have thought that they would have been more concerned. I now have pencils that are 3" inches tall. (started out brand new) They just break and crumble. Horrible.
1,While I love the idea of these scissors, the fact is that they are very cheaply made. Opening and closing them does not work smoothly. Would not recommend.
1,This color "cherry red" does not match other red heart cherry red yarn that I purchased at JoAnns. Don't be like me, purchase your yarn in person so you can properly swatch the color.
1,I was disappointed with this item. It doesnt work 3/4 of the time when I want it to. Not sure if it was stored properly or NOT before it was sent to me. If I get another it will be from my local StampinUp rep so I can return it if there is a problem.
1,I've grown sort of disgusted with the Copic price. Copics sell for just three dollars where they are made. And they were imported into the United States. That was the excuse for the 8 dollar per marker price. But that's just not an excuse any more. The markers are made in countries all around the world now so they don't have to be imported. But the price is so high. I just went to a show and was just chatting with the guy and he commented what a good value the refills are. And I guess I felf disgusted because I have about five dried out copic markers. They used to last for years without drying out but these were dry in less than two years. I only have about twenty pro square style copic markers and usually only use the set of grays.  But lets say you buy a set of 72 like this and you want the refills count on paying 800 dollars to keep them all running.  I just think its awful and there is not excuse for it.  We can see comparable markers being sold on Amazon for just 50 cents each with great reviews. They don't have as extensive a selection of colors. The quality control is slightly yes. But the color and flow on the cheap ones are great. The problem is the copics are likely made for 5O cents or less as well. Its exploitive. The wine industry hit a crisis because people were realizing really expensive wine was not that much better than the reasonably priced stuff. They dropped a lot of their wines under ten dollars again and some for 5 dollars and below. Here's hoping people will buy some of these cheap sets and realize Copics arent' eight dollars better.  Blick Art Studio markers have a brush and fine tip comparable to the Copic for just three dollars.  But people will reply...well if you want the best you have to pay the price to get it and its worth it.  But the truth is if these are three dollars where they are sold they are worth three bucks. They have psyched themselves into Rolls Royce pricing and like wine its more about the mystique and prestige.
1,Too small to do any thing with.
1,This Ranger brand makes very nice ink pads.... only light pressing needed. Should last a long time. I like the vivid color collection.		edit - Two stars - The pad has dried out already, after only three months of minimal use. I even store all my pads in a square Tupperware-type sealed container. The pad itself has become hard like cardboard.
1,dried out.
1,They would not screw.  They were too big even though I have ChiaoGoo interchangeables.
1,does not work good
1,HATE THEM!..Had to wait weeks for delivery..tried to use them..impossible for me! Lots of them stuck together.tried to pry them apart they jump out of my grasp.. They are too small and the opening is not large enough..Waste of time.. I have used covers many times before,never had this problem! Would not buy them from this Company again.
1,not recomend waste of money
1,I had two duds before I got one that worked right. Customer support is a joke. :( But when you do get them, customer service has delays and runaround patter down to a T.		I only bought the machine to use it with Sure Cuts a Lot. Fortunately I bought my machine before the lawsuit, but... I can no longer update it for fear of it no longer working with my third party software.		Just not a good value, I gingerly use it for occasional projects, as it intermittently make weird noises now. When it dies I am getting something that works with third party software.		Oh, and they have the most ridiculously restrictive 'Angel Policy' in the world. Totally full of unenforceable bull crap. Why they would lie to us, their customers, on this stuff is unclear, but it lets you know they don't value us.
1,i really thought the cable was going to be softer or more flexible. i have needles i got from eknitting needles, they are very user friendly. i'm kind of disapointed, i saved up to buy & i waited a long time to buy these addi needles. just not what i expected...
1,These pencils are OK. They are a cheap set that will get a teacher off your back who is requiring the class to purchase sets for themselves. The eraser is average, and the sharpener is better than average, because it is metal. There are better sets out there, with higher quality graphite. I plan to get a better set in the future when these sharpen down to nothing. I'm not saying don't buy them, they will work if they are all you can afford, but if you can afford a better set, go with that one. Also, the packaging won't work for a long term pencil holder, so if you don't already have a seperate pencil case, prepare to have trouble with this set.
1,look nothing like what is pictured way over priced for what I got.
1,Non compatible with Australian power points.  This is not shown in any of the advertising for electrical goods so is unuseable.
1,does not cut with dies as advertised.
1,This is the worst product I've ever purchased from Amazon!  It worked for the first 9 rows, but had to manually move the number for 10.  Then, it quickly became less reliable until, long before my project was finished, it totally quit.  Very poor product; I wish I would have put my money toward the green Clover one!
1,Did not work for me.  Moves around on my sole plate, ruining the purpose of it!!!  My machine must be made of metal, I cannot figure it out.  Why won't  it grip?  It just grips a little bit.  Maybe the magnet is too high up in the case?  I will do more research and re-do this review if I can get it to work right.  I see from other reviews that other people got it to work.
1,I needed yellow paint. Never had a problem with Liquitex Basics before, but the jar of paint when opened wasd caked. I used acrylic paint liquifier to loosen it so the pain would flow but that hasn't worked. Next time The Art Store!
1,I ordered 5 sets and I was billed for 5 sets but I only got 4 sets.
1,Too small to get pages out of a coloring book!
1,Ive never left a bad review in my life but there's a first time for everything. DO NOT BUY THIS. I saw reviews saying they got the wrong size needle but decided to get it anyways. Never did I think they would lie about the cord size! It showed up today and it is nowhere near 40 inches. It's barely even ten. Utterly useless waste of money. Will be returning immediately and spending the extra for a trusted brand.
1,Very brittle/fragile and much longer than I'm used to!
1,Be aware no hook included and the pattern is not printed on the wearing canvas so not the best item for children under 10
1,Worthless. Not only does the swivel feature not help, but there is no information on hpw to change the blade. I contacted the company and never heard back! Also, the safety cap doesn't fit and won't stay on. This iconic brand has gone down hill.
1,So disappointed with quality of this product.  Plastic is very cheap unlike quilting rulers.
1,Complete waste of time and money!  They are flimsy - I figured I'd still use them. They won't even go through fabric!!!!
1,Half of them don't have holes. Very frustrating when u r making jewelry. Pretty colors and shine.
1,Mine came in as small strips of polka dot ribbon.  Very disappointed
1,EDIT: I'm pretty damn disappointed, I was making a hat and halfway down, I came across this weird... thing! I don't know where to cut or reattach my yarn! I love Lion Brand yarn, but I've never had this issue before.		I ordered the chocolate color, but it turned out to be a little darker than the image shows- however, I know that's more because of lighting, so I'm still happy.
1,Never came with the brushes as advertised.
1,One broke taking it out of the package the other broke a week later.
1,Didnt work wekk for me gave to my sister she liked it
1,Very disappointing, but there is no white pigment in this ink pad. The pad itself is soft and squishy (really too juicy, sloppy juicy) and the pad itself looks white, but it creates more of a watermark rather than a stamped white image. DEFINITELY DEFECTIVE--must have been a malfunction when it was MANUFACTURED WITHOUT THE WHITE PIGMENT.		Feb. 5, 2016:  Even long after the replacement/refund window, both Amazon and Tsukineko stood behind their product and issued a refund today.  Amazing customer service just reinforces my loyalty to Amazon!
1,I purchased this machine from the C (membership store) and it was the worst purchase I have ever made.  This machine doesn't work at all.  The thread bunches (birds nest) and breaks.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it.  I cannot sew anything with this machine.  It has ruined the project I was working on.  I miss my old Singer, it was an older model but it worked great until it died.  This new machine is not reliable.  I called Singer and spoke with a rep. -  who was curt and rude. She talked me through the threading process to make sure it was threaded correctly - however the machine still didn't work correctly.  The rep. said that I needed to have this machine serviced because my tension discs were "off".  This machine has been this way since day one so basically that means the tension discs were never good to begin with.  I am very disappointed in Singer product and will not purchase their products again.  No customer service at all. Goodbye Singer, I'll purchase another brand.
1,They are not flexible enough.  They don't open far enough.  I'm not using them.
1,This thing does not work. If you want a stitching awl, get a cheaper brand. It will do the same and you will save money.
1,I was very disappointed in this tape. It is very thin and see through, unlike regular duct tape. Can be repositioned and sticks ok, but had to double every strip used to be sure it would be strong enough to hold on cardboard. I really like the bright yellow color, but since it was so thin and near transparent was unable to use it for my project.
1,Sent back - cheap not heavy enough
1,I was expecting origami paper to be white on one side, to make it easier to follow the folding directions.  I am using the paper to teach my 6 year old granddaughter, and it is difficult to keep the directions straight without the help of the white side to be able to tell if she has made the correct folds.  I'm not a novice (I was an art teacher for over 20 years), but having the paper exactly the same on the front and back sides is not good for a beginner.		Also, this was part of a larger order, and the cellophane wrapper split in shipment and spilled into the box, wrinkling a number of the sheets.
1,I wish I'd read the other reviews about the new set not matching the old one. Because I now have that problem too. It is not fun when you like products enough to buy them again, but they've changed.
1,This item did not work (defective), and I cannot get a hold of anyone to return it and get a refund :-(
1,Not happy with these!!! Two of the needles had inconsistencies in the eye of the needle in that I couldn't get thread through it without it fraying. One other needle let me thread it but the thread snapped 4 stitches in. I gave the needle the benefit of the doubt and tried again and it snapped a second time.  VERY FRUSTRATING!
1,I used this and it is suppose to be tearaway.  It is not easy to tear this material.  I had a problem with stitches ripping out.  To me it feels more like a heavy weight.
1,Cutting mat too small.  The rest of the items are great.
1,Fabric is cute and it's a very well made, high quality product.  Sewn together very well.  But I would not recommend it as a useful storage solution.		Bulky and too small for really thin colored pens and markers (Staedtler fine line), even spaced in every other slot.  I bought it because reviews and answered questions said they also used them for pens.  HA!  There is no way they actually use them for that and I'm assuming they all just assume pens could theoretically fit because the pencils do.  I could barely squeeze my super thin pens in there and with the caps, you can't fit them side by the side, the same way.  You have to alternate them, one facing top, one facing bottom.  Even then, it was very difficult to get them in and out because the slots are so tight.  Wasn't able to roll it up or fold it neatly like it shows in the image (where it's obviously empty), had to kind of fold it in half, and it still wouldn't go in half, which means it's quite large when filled, and it was in no way easily portable.  I could have put them all in 2 regular pencil boxes and saved a ton of space.		I did give this to my daughter for her colored pencils to test it out and it is still incredibly bulky and will not roll up neatly, but it will roll up.  The flaps to help protect the pencil tips (that I just don't see working well for that purpose and wouldn't trust my expensive pencils in it) add to the bulk and difficulty rolling up.  Still very bulky and it's only a little over half full of mostly used (so short)  Crayola and equivalent brand colored pencils.		Maybe if you only used every other slot, it would roll up nicely.		I think one without the flap over the pencil tips would roll up a lot better plus I think it would offer the tips more protection by not having that extra fabric pushing on them after being rolled up and instead giving the tips space.  If you reverse the pencils, their tips are to the inside and the fabric angles and touches the tips too much for my liking.  If the slots are tight, you do not need the flap to hold them in.  Go for one without the flaps.  I'm strongly considering cutting the flaps off since I missed the return window while willing myself to like it and my 9yo thinks it's so cool to have her pencils in it.  I want to make it easier for her to keep loving it and using it.		The cords to tie it are like a thick sweatshirt drawstring.		I'm actually surprised that a lot of people seem to like this method but I wonder if they actually use them frequently, take them places, etc.		I ended up buying a leather zip up wristlet style one to fit 160 and I like it A LOT better.  I put my pens, markers, and graphite pencils in it.  Tight squeeze there too, but they fit and all facing the same directions, it's able to be zipped up and I can actually fit it into a large purse or tote no problems for when I take them places.		I left my Prismacolor pencils in their tin and Staedtler ergosoft pencils in the plastic standing case that they came.  Even though I want all of my supplies together, they are safer and easier to deal with that way and the footprint is a lot smaller, making them easy to toss in any bag or even just with a coloring book not in a bag and go.  I may get another smaller zipper book wristlet style one for them once their cases are wrecked.
1,I purchased these to use instead of double-pointed needles, which I dislike using.  I found them difficult to use because the bamboo point portion is just too short.  I ordered a different set of circular needles (12") which were considerably more expensive, but well worth it for the difference in point length.
1,It arrived in a timely manor but I found it doesn't work up to expectations.
1,Definitely large enough to hold my watercolor paper (which comes as 22x30". Board is 24x36"). However, if I wasn't using this to simply stretch and hold my paintings in place as I worked, I would be a bit more disappointed. I am a flexible person and can make do with what is given to me. But I am also truthful. This board is rather flimsy, unlike other hardboard panels I have purchased in the past. It also had several greasy, very noticeable fingerprints on one end. Part of one edge had been squished, and a corner of the board had been partially chipped off.		Again, I can make do with this, because it's going to be covered up 99% of the time with taped-on watercolor paper. I don't believe the price should have been so high for a banged-up board, but hey, at least I have it and can begin working on some larger pieces now.
1,Purchase as gift really enjoy
1,I was so excited for this tool and highly disappointed when I got it and tried it. Sure, it snips excess wire and sort of makes a loop - but the loop does not close. In fact, I had at least 1mm of open space in the loop. So I still had to go back and close it with my round nose pliers. Some people might not mind that with their jewelry, but for me, I know it's just asking to snag someone's hair if used for earrings or someone's sweater or scarf if used in a necklace. The gap was large enough for a seed bead to slip off. After trying it with many different wires and headpins, I knew it wasn't something I was doing, it was the tool design that needed a little more work.		 I returned the tool.
1,doesn't clean brushes very well
1,Just don't expect the beads to look anything like those in the image for the product. Pretty much all the same month green with mottled brown. Not terribly attractive and not much variety, as they show in the image. Also, they come from a China- be ready for wait.
1,total waste of money and time. This thing drops stitches NONSTOP, there is no way of knitting continuous thing with it. it grabs the fibers in the yarn (plied or non plied, doesn't matter, tried different weights, same result) and actually cuts the yarn! it completely ruined one of my expensive yarns.	Compared to cheap kids singer knitting machine, a $20 machine did MUCH better job. Returned it instantly.
1,Pigments are nice when I can use them. 3/4 of all 72 pencils have leads broken down to about the last 3 inches or so.
1,I was shocked by how small these are. They are going to be very difficult to work with, considering their size. I'm also disappointed in the quality - they look dull.  Even at their low price, they are not worth that price.
1,I bought a sizzix Bigkick and was disappointed to see that it only came with the regular size cutting plates (which makes no sense, since the whole reason for buying the Bigkick is to use it with big dies!).  I used these to cut leaves and pinecones out of brown paper for my sister's wedding.  After using the plates for about twenty runs, I was dismayed to see little white flecks of plastic attached to the diecuts...After about thirty runs, there was a white powder embedded in the die cuts.  I had to use a heatgun to reseal the plastic every ten cuts or so, which required a lot of down time for cooling, resealing, etc.  So...not impressed.  Also, they buckle and become bent way too easily.  This was another reason I had to use my heat gun--to CAREFULLY reheat the length of the plates so I could push them black into a flattened position, then cover with heavy books so they would cool flat.  Lame.
1,First, I want to say- This is a PATTERN! I'm rating this so low for a few reasons. The description was very deceptive, it describes the bag and gives you the feeling that it's a ready made bag. I wouldn't have spent this much on instructions. I didn't mind because I thought I'd just make my own bag but after checking it out the instructions seem very difficult to a new sewer.  It should describe the ease of pattern, etc, NOT just what the finished bag will be.
1,I had ordered a Medium Bodied and the 1st time received Heavy Bodied. Contacted seller and	asked for a replacement, Happy so far, however I received my replacement and again Heavy Bodied	with a sticker on the side saying Medium Bodied.	I was looking forward to doing my arts this weekend :0( not happy.  I'm sure the product would be ok if	I had the right product.  I guess I will not know.  not happy, not happy...
1,Not comfy
1,Supposed to be woodless pencils. They are not. Not very good pencils at all.
1,Too thin for my use on gourds.  Loved the colors but they just don't work as I had hoped.	Guess they are better on paper...
1,They seem cheap and for the life of me I can't figure out how to get them onto the wand.  They're in the back of my closet.
1,looks cheap and not made well.
1,too small
1,It reeks of cigarette smell. I got this product and started cutting it into the size pieces I need and started choking and my eyes were burning because it smelled so much like cigarettes. I am a non smoker and can't stand the smell of cigarettes. Now I have to figure out how to air out 10 yards of this before I can use it. Not good.
1,These reviews must not be honest. You can't write on this stuff. Pencil and pen doesn't leave a mark. Markets sure leave a mark, but the material soaks up the ink into a thick uneven line and bleeds through to the pattern. It also arives wrinkled badly, and you can't iron it. It reacts very poorly to heat. What else... It's VERY thin, you can't drape or test fit with it or anything like that. I can't believe I wasted $20 on this. I should have tried it out earlier and realized it wasn't useful so i could return it.
1,The chain is too weak.		The first thing I do when I get any jewelry chain is I tug on it, to make sure it won't break if it gets caught on a shirt, or in case a child tugs on it.		This chain breaks with barely any pressure.		I can foresee it even breaking just under the weight of a heavier necklace.		I really don't get any pleasure in giving negative reviews, but I don't want anyone to waste their time and money on something that I wouldn't use.
1,This takes WAAAAAY too long to dry.  I gave up on it and bought the stuff that you iron
1,Could not get to work in my cuttlebug
1,For the price it should have some type of padding underneath to prevent from moving. It's like a piece of paper very thin.
1,This product I was so excited for, but after trying to use these for jewelry I ended up breaking the leaves since it was so thin in some spots just snapped. Some of the leaves are cute, but didn't hold up.
1,too watery
1,Glue leaks everywhere, save up for a good one.  I wish I had not purchased this or read the comments saying it was worth the money.
1,Little
1,The thread breaks in the machine and the thread is much smaller than I was expecting
1,Not worth the price. Doesn't work very well. As far as I'm concerned, it's no better than trash. Will give to my granddaughter to play with and buy something better, hopefully made in the good ol' U.S. of A. where quality matters a little more!
1,Guess I got what I paid for. Looks cheap.
1,Bought for travel, I think it is bulky
1,They're screwed together too tight, made cutting hard.
1,I was originally pretty happy with this purchase, but then I went to use the eyelet tool.		They sent me 2 snap setting pliers instead of 1 snap and 1 eyelet. I imagine since the packaging just kinda pops apart, a shipment got mixed up and a worker just shoved pliers back, so somewhere, someone has 2 eyelet pliers lol.		The hole punch, the snap pliers, and the metal bits are great though.
1,These didn't work with my Cuttlebug. I tried all different plates and papers. The die that is supposed to say "hello friend' would cut the word 'friend', but 'hello' never came out right. None of the other dies worked either. Also, none of the dies even came close to cutting through cardstock
1,seems a little thin for medium weight
1,I bought these because they are inexpensive.  You quickly learn fear because they unscrew very easily.  AND THEN, one attempt at tightening the out of fear, and the soft metal of the needles, lips when you screw the cable in - and you can't get the yarn over it without a fight.		Plus, the kit had one bad knitting cable connector, so in-between projects... I had to work around my lack of enough resources.		fine, for a first purchase, but one thing goes wrong in your projects and you are in trouble.  I expected more.		I would recommend investing in at least a $60-90 brand of needles.  It's a step up, but you won't waste cash.
1,rather weak magnets, had to be directly touching to close, a layer of fabric or other between sides of clasp interrupts the magnetism.
1,Looks good but they stick together  and some of the houses are closed you cannot use
1,Outer color of marder doesn't match actual marker color and several arrived dried out.
1,Ehhh I really wanted to like this, but the more I use it the more I regret buying it. You have to make sure you always use the bubble buster spray and a mold release. I use plaster so I have to stick the mold in the freezer before casting because the heat destroys the detail.
1,This 3 pack was a huge disappointment. Only 1 of the tools was useable. The needle nose pliers were offset so they are crooked when they are closed and they are so weak that they twist further out of alignment when working with dead soft wire! Making coils is impossible with them and even making a loop at the end of a wire is an exercise in patience. The chain nose pliers are not flat inside, they are grooved. That would be fine if they had been filed AT ALL after casting. Instead the grooves are of varying heights and are extremely sharp. There is also a large lip of sharp metal on the edges of the pliers. I have tried knocking it off with a hammer to no avail. Anytime I use these pliers with any gauge larger than a 24g they chew the wire up so bad it's ruined. Taping them hasn't helped much due to the sharpness of the grooves. The cutters are the only tool that works well. I would return it but it is a hassle. I am just going to chalk it up to a lesson learned; you get what you pay for.
1,Not watercolor paper. More like watercolor textured printer paper. it works if you're planning to use markers on an off white piece of paper, but this is thin, lightweight and not suitable for water!
1,Nice shapes but these are thin. They are easy to bend.
1,This is a case of FALSE ADVERTISING!!!  They show a picture of Genuine Brother Bobbins bag, but what you get is NOT.  These ship from China, take an inordinate amount of time, and in most cases are NOT THE PROPER SIZE.  Buyers Beware, be careful about ordering these.  Remember, they are cheap, you will definitely get what you pay for.
1,Difficult to see the marking.  Doesn't work very well?
1,Horrible item, I just opened the box to use it and it is scratched EVERYWHERE! Deep scratches. It's definitely used. How am I suppose to use it with these deep scratches all over it??? Do not waste your money. I'm very upset.
1,uses brush nibs for hair. Not everyone can afford those. a package of 3 is 7 dollars! This price needs to come down. Its insane.
1,I bought these expecting greatness according to reviews. I'm not happy with the limited color selection. There are only 11 colors total..just repeated for water-soluble. And 12 plain drawing pencils. I got these to use on coloring books. I wish I had tried them as soon as I got them. It's too late to return them.
1,I was working on a blue and white quilt.  Most marking pens and pencils are either blue or white, so I was pleased to find this set that contained many colors.  However, alas, it did not live up to its promise.  I had two major issues with these pencils.		1.) The color does not consistently come out of fabric.  The first time I used these, I used green and was able to wash it out.  However, I subsequently used it on a second quilt, again using green, and despite repeated washing in hot water, I was unable to get the pencil out.  In fairness, the product description does not indicate that these chalks wash out, so perhaps they are intended to be permanent.  However, I DO NOT recommend this as a temporary chalk marking tool.		2.) The chalk did not stay extended out of the cartridge.  In the course of marking a quilt, the chalk would gradually be pushed into the cartridge.  I'd be unable to pull it out again (due to not being able to get a grip on it), and I'd have to get a second piece of chalk and push it all the way out the other end of the cartridge, then reinsert it.  This process quickly became annoying and had to be done 10 or 20 times in the course of marking a crib-size quilt.		Unfortunately, it looks like I am still in search of the perfect marking tool.  No luck yet!
1,I guess you sometimes really do get what you pay for.  These were very inexpensive and should be in the .99 Store not Amazon.  That's what they are worth. Very cheaply made.  I learned my lesson though so next time I"ll know.
1,I really wanted to love this machine but the embroidery unit didn't work right out of the box. It would stitch but the designs were unrecognizable. The sewing part of this machine worked fine but I only had it a few days before it was returned due to the embroidery not working correctly. I had called a three sewing machine shops for assistance and was told that Singer products are not made as well as they used to be, I was urged to return the Singer and try a different brand.
1,does not look like the picture. It has beveled edge, Hope it will work. I have one like these and I had tangling troubles. Not the exact size the machine needs. sometimes it works sometimes it does not. would not have bought it if the picture had been correctly shown.
1,I can't believe I wasted 10 minuets of my life with this ridiculous thing! It seemed like a nice little to project to relax with at the end of the day. This was the most irritating "masterpiece" ever! First of all, the directions are a mess in the little pamphlet, I didn't know where to begin. It makes is seem like a clear coat goes down first because they refer to the paint as "color glaze"... it's just super cheap, thin, sort-of acrylic paint. It instructs you to gently SCRUB the color into the AREAS of the gray scale canvas. What? The paint brushes included are the size of kindergarteners brushes, make out of something like brittle horse hair that falls out and breaks off all over the picture.		This whole thing is just scrubbing and scraping really thin cheap paint over a shadow of an image, so you can see through the paint, and see the weird little picture under it. This is supposed to look good? Seriously, just buy a paint by number, they look fantastic compared to this!
1,Didn't really like the quality on these
1,got it less than a month befor it started to rust
1,I actuallly love this die, it is so perfect for a wedding Save the Date or party or RSVP.  However, when I received the die, I was so anxious to try it out only to discover that it is a smidget too large for both my Big Shot machines.  I am so very disappointed again in Spellbinders.  It seems like they could have cut the sides of this die in just a tiny bit closer to the cutting line to be able to fit all machines.  I also think Spellbinders could have written on the package or in the writeup that it only fits Spellbinders machines or that it does not fit the Big Shot machines.
1,Well it seemed like a good deal...but...This glue is so thick...almost could not get out of bottle....old stock.
1,I must warn you that this product broke after less than 30 uses in less than a month.  I had to fix it myself and it never worked properly, so I gave it to my little next door neighbor girl.
1,I have all for of these I Kan'dee Chalk sets. I have even talked my sister into buying them.	The other 3 are great and easy to learn to use.	HOWEVER, the Metallic set arrived with the plastic insert that protects the colored disks MELTED to half of the colors which made them come out of the tray and break when I removed the inside plastic cover.	Ten OTHER colors had melted into hard lumps.	The other sets are fun and creative, but skip the metallic set.
1,Low quality
1,This is a few inches of flimsy chain that could be easily replaced by a like amount of thin ribbon or dental floss. Poke a tiny hole in the plastic protector that comes with the scissors and thread a string through and tie cover to scissors.  Don't waste your money on this..
1,This comes up when searching for glow in the dark but doesn't glow at all
1,Could not get them started...wasted most of them
1,I purchased this in two pound increments less than five years ago and I just pulled it out to fabricate a prototype.  The part A is as hard as a rock.  Unless you plan to use this up in a year or two beware of buying it in large quantities.  It was kept sealed in the original container in a climate controlled space.  I am very dissappointed in this product.  The manufacturer needs to put an expiration date on it.  It makes me wonder if the part A also oxidizes in the final mix.
1,Bought this to decorate for my sons street art dance hoping for more glow. However there was not a lot of  glowing coming off this yarn. Did look neat latticed across the ceiling but white would have done the job just as well. Two stars for being a great product, strong, well packaged just not much 'glow'.
1,They work, but my yarn sticks at the joint of each needle. I find it easier to knit on metal tips with smoother joints so that the yarn moves smoothly and easily.
1,In this case, "You get what you pay for" doesn't apply. This brush isn't worth what you pay for it. It's supposed to be #1 Filbert. It is that in name only.	It came with no tube to protect the bristles -- just rattling around loose in a large box.	Before use, I examined it: The bristles fly in all directions. Viewed from the narrow side, the bristles don't come to a sharp edge. Viewed from the broad side, the shape is jagged. I used some small scissors to trim off some of the errant bristles. I suppose I can use it for scratching grass into wet pigment.	Not worth my time to return it. Worth my time to find out I'll never buy another W&N brush.
1,Blah Blah Blah. A Plus for not having to use batteries, negative as an activity set. One has to sit there and pump it all day long for a toddler to use. Nice forearm workout, poor spray result.
1,I wanted this quickly so I picked it up from Michael's rather than order it from Amazon.  I needed to glue card stock together to make gift boxes.  Everything I used it on came apart within 2 days.  I don't recommend it.
1,Ads and videos on this product claimed that it would give me a better cut WITH little or no paper fragments left on the die and no little bits to pick out of the resulting cut.  Not so.  I compared the cut using an intricate butterfly die with and without the Precision Base and saw no difference in quality.  As for picking paper fragments out of the die and the resulting cut, I got the same result with and without the Precision Base - both ways needed time spent clearing away fragments.  I guess it's back to using dryer sheets.
1,This yarn is advertised as having 364 yards per skein.  It only has 236 yards.  I can buy it cheaper at somewhere else.
1,The base has no weight to it and will not tolerate much of a tug on the yarn and you will need to tug once the yarn reaches the top of the "ball" or cake when it tends to catch. Do yourself a favor and shell out for the Chiagoo wooden version.
1,Way, way, to thin, it bends in your hand. Placement of the hand is  uncomfortable as well. I  don't like it at all, sent it back.
1,I know this is a paper punch. but I bought it thinking it would cut through felt..... lets just say the punch got jammed and I had to pry it open with a flat tip screw driver. it works great on paper, but if your buying it to punch out fabric or FELT.... DO NOT BUY THIS! haha I learned the hard way! Happy Crafting!
1,I was hoping this roll of stabilizer would be similar to my Floriani tear away, but unfortunately this is just a roll of paper.  Would not purchase again.
1,Sucks! Can't believe these are copic! The tips break easily. Do yourself a favor and get some cheaper ones as they're better and if they do wear out they're cheaper to replace!
1,The way these are designed to apply is terrible!!!  They pull a hole upon use!!!  Either find a different type of these that apply differently or use Velcro.  Using one of these destroyed my project due to the way you put them on and they are held onto the project!!!
1,When I received this bag it smelled so bad of petroleum that I had to put it outside, I could not stand it in the house. I left it outside for 5 days but still could not stand it in the house.  As far as the bag, it is great for storing yarn and knitting something with multiple yarns if you can stand the smell of the bag, but it does not have adequate storage for needles and other items
1,These 'chalk' markers cannot be used on most chalkboards!  It said it toward the bottom of the product description, so I am somewhat to blame for not thoroughly reading the description, but I think, like most people, if I see a chalk marker, I am going to presume it is safe to use on chalkboards.		I got these to use on mini chalkboards I got for a craft fair I am doing, and went to do my price list, got something wrong and went to wipe it off...and the chalkboard is permanently stained with the ink.  It was then I went and read the description and saw you can't use these on non-porous chalkboards (in other words, you cannot use them on chalkboards, period!) but you can use them on the same brand on chalk board contact paper *rolls eyes*		A handful of cash down the drain for this product and another few bucks for the ruined chalkboard I am now going to have to replace.  Don't buy these if you actually wan't to use them on chalkboards!		The reason I gave them two stars instead of one:  they do actually write beautifully and the ink flows nicely.  But YOU CAN'T USE THEM ON CHALKBOARDS!!!  Smh.
1,I go through a lot of round nose pliers because most of the multi-use sets don't close evenly and the tips tend to overlap when trying to make loops and eyepins. Being Beadsmith, I had high hopes for these, too, but after a few days of serious use making a dozen rosaries, once again I have a useless set of pliers for that purpose. I guess you have to sacrifice quality for convenience when using the multi-use pliers.
1,Doesn't "cling" at all!
1,Go on badly.
1,Color is a Bright Pumpkin Orange NOT golden yellow as shown. The color recieved is a nice orange for pumpkins and pumpkin hats so I did not return.
1,Doesn't cut anything stronger than regular paper. Worthless
1,This yarn was beautiful in color but the quality was horrible....so bad I'm thinking of writing to red heart.  It separated into separate strands almost through the entire skein, and I used 9 skeins out of the 10 I bought.  I would not buy this again...which is too bad because the color was really pretty!
1,These are so small they are very difficult to use.
1,This product is not exactly useless, but does nothing you can't do just as easily, and perhaps even more accurately, with just a ruler.  The laser line is too thick to be accurate within less than 1/8 of an inch, and it goes in only one direction, I was expecting there to be two lines at 90 degree angle.		I did not buy this from Amazon - but from another online retailer - it was a Christmas sale price for less than $40.  But, they do not accept returns unless unopened, so I wish I had purchased from Amazon so I could easily return it.		Save your money - this is not worth even close to what it costs (even at bargain prices).
1,As I was knitting the scarf I am planning to give as a gift, I noticed that my fingers were red, then I looked at my bamboo knitting needles and they are red part way down.  The red dye bleeds and this is not something I can give to someone as a gift.  I am going to try to wash in cool water and see if I can salvage this fabric yarn but I won't purchase this red fabric yarn again.  The other ones (different colors) that I purchased at the same time, do not bleed like this.
1,I will never buy this again. It continually unraveled and falls apart. You get what you pay for.
1,i really have mixed feelings about these stitch markers.  I love the concept but wish these were a little larger and more substantial.		I originally bought the clover stitch markers that you have to lock into place, and I believe they are a little larger and easier to handle for people who are beginning to have problems with stiff fingers.  the only drawback with the clover stitch markers is having to lock them, so it's difficult to use just one hand.  with the knitter's pride, tho, I found that using one hand could cause the red heart super saver economy yarn to split if not inserted very carefully.		with both kinds of stich markers, i find it safer to insert a hook into the stitch first and then slide the stitch markers in close to the hook to keep from damaging the yarn.  removal takes 2 hands, so as not to stretch and split the yarn.  while crocheting, one of these rotated in the stitch, got caught, and pulled, stretched and split the stitch.  I'd say both kinds of markers have their drawbacks.  slipping a small piece of different-colored left-over yarn into a stitch is probably still the safest thing to do (especially since i have to insert a hook in the stich to place a marker there anyway).		also, i think the knitter's pride markers will be much easier to lose, because they are so small and light weight.  in addition, i have to worry about my small cat getting hold of one of these markers to play with and possibly accidently swallowing it ... have to be careful with all small items (and he really does leave my crochet things alone), but these just seem too tiny and light weight.  especially for that reason, plus the other listed reasons, I'm deducting three stars.  oh, i do love that knitter's pride at least includes more markers in the package than clover does ... think i'll keep these to use as a back up for "in-a-pinch" situations (yet hope that situation never arises).		as i said, i love the concept, so if knitter's pride would make these a little larger and heavier/thicker, i would be much more likely to use them on a regular basis.  i should have known how tiny these would be from the highly enlarged product photo.  I've found that with some things, tho, you just have to find out for yourself.  I guess I'm much like the very curious cat ... and at least I'm satisfied that I'm no longer curious (about these stich markers, anyway). lol
1,Easily the most overrated craft tool I've ever stumbled upon. I kept seeing this mat in a lot of crafty Youtubers I follow and thought I should get one to protect my craft desk and make cleanup a snap. I should've paid more attention. This isn't so much a mat as it is a sheet of plastic paper. I mean, I have placemats with more substance and I got them cheaper from Ross.		Do you have a cheap silicone mat from the dollar store? Parchment paper? Do you have access to a laminator you can use to laminate a 12x12 piece of paper? Congratulations - you've got yourself a freakin' craft mat dupe. If I hadn't thrown the box away immediately after receiving this, I would have certainly sent this back. $14 for this is highway robbery. I promise you, you don't need this - go buy yourself a nice stamp set instead.
1,A clumsy little device for which I ultimately found no use.  It's stashed in my craft room awaiting a child who might like to tinker with it.
1,This seemed great, but has a flaw which causes problems often. Mainly, this is due to the somewhat warped edge of one half of the board, which folds neatly for storage. I wish now I'd spent a bit more for one by Martha Stewart.
1,Didn't work as expected. Glow was faint.
1,i have a few large circular sets from this brand. this pair got me through one chunky knit blanket but didn't make it through the second one. I first noticed the tip of one of the needles had worn down or chipped off due to friction against the other while knitting. A splinter then started snagging my yarn until the tip cracked a bit. I decided to keep going after smoothing out the wood but then the wire broke off one of the needles and that was that.	I had no issues and enjoyed them through the first project aside from their very stiff cables that would bend and twist at times making the movement of stitches difficult.	I have two more sets of a different size and I'm hoping they hold up but I'm not optimistic.
1,I bought these for my Explore Air based on suggestions that they were better than Cricut brand and cheaper as well, and I really wanted to like them.  I do a lot of intricate cuts and these just don't work for those.  I tried all three blades in the package and they just did a terrible job with intricate cuts on vinyl (the cuts were sloppy and generally imprecise.  The vinyl was torn and ragged looking along the edges).  I went out and bought new Cricut brand blades and was back in business.  I'm not really a Cricut cheerleader, and use very few of their branded materials and supplies aside from the machine, but I will stick with their blades over these.
1,I use a lot of brands and types of markers and brush pens and thought this would hold and organize them all. I now realize this was designed to hold a specific brand of marker. While every marker/pen has fit in the squares in the tray, my taller pens (Tombows) keep the lid from closing. My smaller diameter markers (those similar to an ink pen in diameter) flop around in the square slots. It's designed for shorter, squatter, markers (Prismcolor, etc.) and only those truly fit in the slots and allow the lid to close.		My next issue with this is, in a strange way, it's size. It's almost a foot and a half long and has a hinged lid, which is almost another foot and a half long. So when the top is open and flipped back, it takes up almost three feet of space. So whether at my desk, on the sofa, or propped up in bed, this thing took up a lot of space.		Next, I find myself constantly tipping this bin part way onto it's side so I can see the colors and chose one. When it's upright, you have to look down into it to see the markers and chose your color as the markers are below the side edge of the bin, below eye level. I'm not especially tall (5'3"), so I almost felt I needed to sort of "lift up" to look down into it. I found this awkward, I guess I'm use to my markers laying out in front or beside me and seeing the colors that way. So then I started to tip it slightly over so that the markers were more "aimed" at me and it was easier to see colors. Of course, tipping it sideways is tricky, if the angle is too steep, they fall out, so I'd end up sticking something under it so it would only tip far enough to allow me to see colors but not far enough to spill. I think what ArtBin needs to do is have two parts to this bin, the bottom tray part and the top/lid part, and have them equal in depth so that when you open the top, it opens to about halfway up the markers so you can see your colors better. I would also make the top half a snap on/removable thing rather than a hinge so that you don't have to have it take up so much space when you're using it.		Finally, I got the additional tray, which comes with additional parts and it means you have to remove a partition from the bin. Neither the additional parts nor the partition can be stored in the bin for safekeeping. That irritated me as you know that a year from now I'm going to stumble on those things and not remember what they were for and toss them...and then regret it down the road. I tried to lay the partition flat on the bottom but it would not due to the slots along the sides, nor would it rest up against the sides or the remaining partition.		In all honesty, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep using this. I suspect that I will tire very quickly of it and end up putting my markers back in coffee cups inside a shoe box (my old system) so that it will be easy to see the colors and won't take up half the desk/sofa/bed.
1,All-purpose dye contains a mixture of an acid dye, which works on nylon, silk, and wool, but not on cotton, and a direct dye, which works rather poorly on cotton. It will not work at all on polyester, acrylic, or acetate. If you are dyeing cotton, you will be much happier with fiber reactive dye, because it is easier to use (no boiling water!), brighter and prettier in color, and much longer lasting in the laundry. Fiber reactive dyes sold by Amazon include Dylon Cold Water Dye, Dylon Permanent Fabric Dye, and, best of all, Jacquard Procion dye. Do a search on Amazon for those dyes now!		If you do choose to use all-purpose dye, first, be sure to buy enough. Each box will dye only one-half pound of fabric for a medium shade, or one-quarter of a pound of fabric for a very dark shade; for a pastel shade, you can dye one pound of fabric with one box. When dyeing nylon, silk, or wool, add six tablespoons of white vinegar per gallon of water; for cotton, do not use vinegar, which won't help, but do add one cup of salt. Using a cooking pot which you will never again use for food (Rit dye is not safe for utensils used in food preparation!), bring the dyebath to a good simmer, 190 to 200 degrees F. (87 degrees C.), add your garment, and continue to simmer for half an hour, stirring frequently. For solid colors, be sure to use a pot that is large enough to allow the garment to move freely.		Even when all-purpose dye is applied to cotton correctly, with simmering hot water, it still tends to wash out in the laundry and bleed on other clothing. To prevent both of these problems, you must apply a commercial dye fixative, such as Retayne or Raycafix; try a web search to find a place from which to order. Washfastness of items dyed with all-purpose dye is greatly improved by the use of the right fixative. Vinegar and salt will not make all-purpose dye on cotton last long in the laundry.
1,nicepaper, nice hard cover, but it's just too small. If you like doodling and do not want to carry paper around, this one fits your pocket (about). Just remember to bring a pen too, for me, I don't like it because it's too small, I feel like it's never big enough for all the details on the sketches that i make.
1,Have tried them all and they just don't work well for me.  One hook is totally useless.
1,Cheap few stones
1,The curve is nice and very convenient, but these scissors are not even almost sharp enough to cut through my little pieces of fabric for applique.
1,Smaller than expected & didn't look like there were 200. Couldn't use them
1,Broke into a million pieces in the field, and the light flickers.
1,These pens are horrible.
1,Everyone raved so about these.  I saved up and got the set of 60, the largest set I could afford.  Big mistake. Yes, the lay down, blending, sturdy leads and all the other hype is true.  I find no fault with the product, the quality is everything I had heard.  This was completely offset for me by the color selection.  I have rarely encountered such a large collection of dark pencils in my life.  About a third to half of the pencils are so dark it is difficult to differentiate between the shades or in some cases even the color (unless you're reading it off the barrel of the pencil).  Sarcasm...may be easier to tell the difference outside in the noon sun.  More sarcasm...these will be useful if I ever decide to attempt colored pencil reproductions of those depressingly dark old dutch masters paintings.  Otherwise, I am going to be investing in a lot of extras in the lighter colors to blend them up to useful.  So I feel that I wasted money buying the larger set.  Also, be warned, the pencil barrels are deceptive, in many cases they are considerably lighter in color than the pencil lays down (they make a pretty display in the case).		My advice....skip this set.  Buy a smaller set, then add selected individual pencils.  It will probably be cheaper overall that way.
1,This product came in opened and all the pens were jumbled up and some were even put in the packaging upside down. Also one of the 48 pens was missing, I only received 47 pens!
1,this was the worst possible piece of equipment I've ever seen.  For one it said that it was hand held.  there wasn't anything to hold on too to wind.  If the handle isn't with it don't say that its hand held.  Second trying to put it together was a chore on its own.  the "manual" that they say comes with it is a sheet of paper that barely tells you what is what.  And when I tried to put on the feed that attaches on to the bottom flat bar it was impossible because it would not fit into the tiny square that is held with a screw to keep it in place.  I was not impressed and sent it back.  I spent the money on a larger and better made.  The price was more but it was easy to assemble and I was using it with in 15 minutes of unpacking it.	Plus the package this comes in is barely called a box and it was all beaten up. I wouldn't even give this one star but that is the only way I could write this.
1,Though it was not to my standard -of the ones I like  and need - they are usable and the customer service department is very helpful ! and cares about the customer.
1,I'm giving this tool two stars due to the fact that it has no instructions included on how to use it. If you want to be able to use it, you will have to spend another $15.00 and order the instruction book. And the instruction book is 8-10 pages, which I felt should have been about $5.00 not $15.00. I am all for free interprise but this is pure greed! I have seen other rulers that come with instruction that work better for less. Don't waste your money.
1,I got this to seal my wefts and the edges of my full lace wigs. On the wefts, I am not sure how well this works because the wefts I sealed were still shedding. On the edges of the full lace wigs it seemed to do a bit of a better job. DOn't use too much or it will turn white. I will not buy this again.
1,Paint is dried out, picture is nice and looks like it would be beautiful once painted...but hard to paint with dried out paint!
1,Too thin and too slow drying.  I knew the title was a con just to get one to purchase it.  The BEST paper glue is tubes of Karen-Marie Klip Glue from Denmark!  By far, the best glue for paper EVER, & I have a huge box of tried glues that did not pass the test.
1,I have purchased many items from Amazon over the years and sadly this is the first time I have felt compelled to give a product a one star rating (because nothing lower is available) and say that this product is ABSOLUTE CRAP. I should have stuck to my instincts and purchased the more expensive Oracal vinyl.  This product is thin and transparent.  It does not even stick well to it's back paper (full of bubbles when you unroll and try to cut it - it does not stay stuck down even when burnished over and over again) let alone stick to the project you purchased this product for!!  This item and the others in the order will be returned.		Cheap price = CHEAP quality.		HORRIBLE - Save yourself the headache and don't purchase !!!
1,I tried to use this, but it didn't work well. It made my serger slide around more than without it, and the little bag to catch trimmings was never in the right spot to really catch them. I just put a trash can right under the serger trimmings and that works better. I now use the "pad" on an open drawer to give me extra work space to temporarily set things. Sorta expensive for that use, but otherwise would have just gone in the trash.
1,I didn't like it
1,do not waste your money..... I have yet to figure out just what I was expecting. but  the tip off of a lead pencil and a quilting needle which is stainless by the way was not what I was expecting. Please go to the model department at hobby Lobby and buy a bottle with a fine tip it costs less than $5 and you can use your coupon for 40% off.
1,I bought this product because it was larger than the other chalkboard paints. I figured I could get more of my project done with one bottle. I was wrong.		I have used another generic chalkboard paints that work better than this product.		Martha Stewart Chalkboard paint goes on very thin requiring more coats of paint. After two coats of this product, there are still bald spots. The cheaper bottles only require two coats.		It also does not tell you that in order for chalkboard paints to work best, you should do one coat vertically and another horizontally.
1,The brushes although stylish handles the brissles in the brush were all too soft for acrylic painting.luckily they were cheap enough.who knows maybe sometime I'll need a softer brush.
1,DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ITEM EVEN IF THEY SAY IT WAS. MUST HAVE BEEN PUT IN ANOTHER PERSONS MAILBOX. FORGET IT I'LL BUT AT THE SEWING STORE
1,Found it to consist of tools I already have...just put them in a little box...just	another gadget that will soon be found deep in my drawer.
1,too expensive and too small
1,Rather annoyed they advertise that the picture is printed on the canvas itself it is not you have to go by the printed picture on paper this is not cheap. Unless you are very artistic and crafty I would advise you not to got this. I can do it but it's much more difficult because you have to do it by pattern on paper and not on the canvas. I bought this for my momI79 who has vision problems thinking that this is going to work and give her something to do she used to do this when she was younger but the picture was on the canvas itself this said it was it is not making it much more difficult.
1,The punch design is beautiful--I just wish it worked!  I tried it with thin paper, patterned scrapbook paper, and cardstock, several sheets of each, and was never ONCE able to get a clean cut out from the teeth of the punch.  Very discouraging.  I had such high hopes for using this punch for a variety of projects.  Boo.
1,I thought it would be easy to peel the glue from these once I was done with my project.  However the glue gets into the ridges and has to be picked out.
1,The quality of Inka Gold is great. I don't have an issue with its use or quality but this color is awful. It is not a red at all and to use that in the name is deceiving. It is more of a deep orange with a slight tint of red. If you are looking for any sort of true red color, this is not it. I have been trying to find a nice red either with the Inka Golds or the Pearl Ex powders and have yet to find it.
1,Great color but it isn't sticking. It's not adhering to 3 ring binder spines, walls, or cabinet shelves. I was trying to use it to color code one of my class periods but it has to frequently be replaced. It just doesn't adhere.
1,Great idea but didn't really work. I shaped a "hook" to hold a pan. Worked great for a couple of months, then just dropped off the wall with the pan. Not a particularly heavy pan, either. I love the concept and really want it to work, but not thrilled with what it can do so far...
1,I does its job.  However, I do not recommend for these issues:  1.  It does not stick to my machine.  2.  It easily gets torn by getting caught up near the presser foot when moving it out to change bobbins.  Also, it tears when larger pieces catch the corners.		I found the Angler 2 tool better since it is made of hard plastic.
1,Took a lot of sanding to get them to take ink.
1,Thought i was ordering 12x15
1,These beads are not blue lace agate, at all. Blue lace agate is light blue and white, usually striped. This looks like apatite although I would honestly says it's dyed
1,The suction does not work, they come off, not good!
1,I think I am spoiled by VersaFine, Hero Hues just isn't as clear of an image in comparison.
1,very deceving, I, as well, thought  that I am buing seiries of 7 brushes, but received just one brush that is grossly overpriced. you can get brush like this one at  Dick Blick store on line for a fraction of this price. very disappointed, very manipulative seller.  eva
1,not of much use
1,returned .  The wrong color
1,These worked great, long enough to cut out a pattern. They started to stick, the spring would not open the blades all the way. I cont to cut with them hoping it would resolve itself. Never did so returned for a replacement. I hope they work, as these are the best scissors I've ever used, as far as cutting fabric.
1,I loved the die but unfortunately a Pro- die machine is needed and that is a 3 to 4 hundred dollar cost. Had to return die.
1,The blade wobbles and con not be tightened on the blade I recived. You could use a box cutter with more accuracy.
1,Very tiny paint tubs.  Extreme Glitter is very thin consistency ,,, it takes many coats to get sugar glitter effect.. Paint does not have enough metallic shine.
1,Unfortunately this doesn't do the job for me. It gives me a horrendous back ache and kills my tailbone. I can't sit on it for very long at all. I broke L3 in the Army and have spinal arthritis, stenosis, retrothesis, and a protruding disc, so maybe it's just me, but this thing was like a torture device.
1,i was very unhappy that this did not come with the cord as the picture show one with it .
1,I never have used sepia ink pens before. I am well versed in the black offered by steadtler, as well as the ones Derwent sell	I wasn't impressed by these, the barrel is a bit thick for my liking and the lines don't lay don't as nicely as my steadtler ink pens, and they are horrible for going over pencil lines. I should have bought the Derwent version, I was impressed with their grey scale ink pens, I can't remember why I purchased these over those. Must have been the 4 sizes over 3 in this set. I guess they are okay for screwing around, but not a big fan.
1,The quality of construction is very poor. Many blemishes not only on the rim, but in the working surface of the pan. Usable, but not with pleasure.
1,I received these from the manufacturer to try and the pens that work are fine but all of the milky colors didn't work at all.
1,prefer my dollar store glue stick.  Dry and hard to spread.
1,Arrived in a crushed box. leaking the sand.  About 3/4 of the bag was already gone when it arrived.
1,This was good in theory but when I try to use it my thread always gets caught up in the adjustable band.
1,The stylus did not work with my ipad at all. Waste of money since I already had tweezers
1,Doesn't fit standard double point needles.
1,A nice sized set with the full spectrum of tips from 1 to 13, and three cables that can be put together or used separately to create a variety of sizes.  The trouble with this set is that the joins are not clean, and come apart frequently and catch on the yarn.  When using this set, I usually have to tighten the joins after every round.  Not fun.  I invested in a higher quality set and now only use these when I need a size i can't find among my other needles.
1,I have some regrets. I watched some incredible videos of this stuff working, but I just cannot match it myself. I've used varying thicknesses, varying lengths of heat and I can barely get a bubble and what I do get is patchy. I'm also used to pushing on a bullet tip for a steady flow of ink, but if you push on the tip while the pen is facing down the ink very quickly seeps out and it took me several puddles to get the hang of it. Perhaps operator error, but I doubt it. Glad it was cheap.
1,This Baby Pink yarn is terrible! As I have been using it there are thin strands that are barely held together. There are strands that are totally frayed and I had to improvise as I was crocheting! Very disappointed. I have other skeins in many colors and not one of them is like the that.
1,These are very hard to open or close. I will stick with the plastic ones.
1,I have used other cotton batting before , even from the Warm Company, and have had no problems until now. This batting was the "LINT MONSTER"  I'm not talking about a little shedding, but constant shedding. It was like having to groom a pet on a daily bases. Thank Goodness for lint brushes. Before I had finished quilting I had filled a grocery bag. When I first opened the bag of batting I thought how soft and puffy. Boy was I in for a rude awakening. The backing of my quilt was navy and by the time I had quilted the first section (length) of the quilt the back became white. I became concerned about catching this lint in my stitches, so I brushed it between changing sections to quilt. I thought to myself maybe this is just an isolated incident, so I asked a question about it and I believe this is not an isolated problem. So if you do choose this batting have lint brush in hand.
1,Really disappointed in this pen. I bought two and the first one wasn't smooth at all and kept leaving streaks everytime I wrote anything. The second pen was a tad better but when I used it again on another day, the entire pen dried up and these don't come cheap!
1,Love these, too!  They neef miles of yarn.  Furry & eyelash yarns won't hold upright, in my experience.  But it works as an accent.
1,to small didn't notice that they would be that small
1,It came in splinters. The box that it was in looked like someone had stepped on it and then knowing something must have broken put it in the box with my other purchases. None of the other things were damaged so the box was put in after someone stepped on it. When I opened it many pieces were in splinters and there was nothing I could do with it but dump it. I'm really surprised at Beadaholique I usually get good service from them. I certainly won't order any plastic racks anymore.
1,It does not work on my machine.
1,Uuuggghh so not what I thought it was.  Said it would hold my 14x15 folders from another company which it does not.  The bottom is tapered hello who does that. And the top storage is pointless. A big time wast of my money.  I bought three how stupid an I ???
1,I must admit I was a little disappointed when these arrived and they did not stick. I had to apply more glue to the back to make them stay flat and because they are so fragile, many broke in the process.	Would not recommend this to anyone living in a humid climate. They don't work.
1,Meh, not for me. They made my ring too tight so I gave them to mom. Her size adjuster popped off and was lost forever but she liked it while it lasted.
1,the screw to tighten is not working well....
1,For the items I wanted to seal, that is, metal pieces of jewelry, it did not have desired effect I needed and had to remove said paint and used polyurethane instead. Despite the surface being very clean and free from any dust, it did not work for me. I wanted a hard shiny surface to protect the delicate engraving. It does state `glaze`on the advertisement and the finish was indeed glazed and took away and distorted the work I needed to preserve.
1,these are cute ONLY for a kids make up play..... not for a real wedding very cheap looking
1,3 stars, because the ad says for HI TEMP glue guns. It should really not say that, because out of a hi temp glue gun this stuff comes out like soup and I can mix and apply epoxy in the time it takes for this glue to set, which it will never really do. I don't know if the glue is really this weak, or if it is being destroyed by the heat.		Out of a dual or a low temp glue gun, this glue is probably great.
1,Other than being flimsy, it's just a piece of junk. It hardly works; after even a few uses, it barley cuts thread. It is cheap junk that isn't even worth the cheap price I paid for it.
1,Too small for my finger
1,http://www.amazon.com/Safety-Walk-Shower-Tread-1-Inch-180-Inch/dp/B000KKRJAY/ref=cm_cd_ql_qh_dp_t		I cut this in thin strips and put on my rulers along each edge and across the diagonal. There is no way this slips. it is adhesive too so cannot lose its cling like this stuff. It is clear and grips like crazy with little pressure
1,Poor quality
1,conflicting reports from the page and the sellers and images about what sizes these needles work for.	my package has smaller purple triangles for US sizes 11-15 (8-10mm needles) and larger red triangles for US sizes 17-19 (12.75-15mm needles).	even though the article number from clover is the same the text info on the packaging is different, and maybe the sizes have changed and gotten smaller considering my colors are also swapped.  but since i can't use these on my 19mm/US35 needles, which is why i purchased them, they're hardly what i would consider jumbo - especially by CYC standards.
1,I bought this to color in some shapes on a 22"x22" bandana - it ran out of ink before I was half way finished.  Very disappointed.
1,First, the brush is cheap and I had hairs falling out constantly. You're not able to paint like in the DVD instructional video because there is not enough pigment provided on the dot cards. The DVD video instruction uses a professional brush and Daniel Smith paints from the tubes. By the time I got the dried paint wet enough to lift I did not have enough to complete the painting. If it weren't such an affordable price I would be a bit more irate about it; however, I can use the flower outlines for other projects. I will not be buying anymore of these projects from Daniel Smith and seriously makes me consider not buying their paints to support nonsense products like this.
1,Case
1,Sheen doesnt hold up well
1,Quality is just okay but the bigger issue is that there are a ridiculous number of duplicates in the package.  There may be a large number of charms but what can you really do with 6 charms that say "New York?"  Or 5 Star of David charms?  That's just the beginning.  I am fairly disappointed.
1,I used the fabric glue and it did not do the job!! It didn't hold the fring that I was putting on my shirt. So I am not sure if the other glue is going to hold. I would not buy this glue. I am going to find a better glue to use!
1,Don't most people look at that ad and assume that the spray bottles go with it like a set?  If it were just the holder, LIKE IT IS!!!!, it should show just the holder. Right? Wrong! What am I not suppose to believe what I see with my own eyes in the ad?  If you can't go by the picture what can you go by? The description? It's wishy washy too. What you get for your money is a block with holes, no spray bottles.  If you want to complete the set, LIKE IT SHOWS IN IT AD, you have to BUY the bottles at almost $50. MORE!!!  If I sound angry?  It's because I AM!  I don't care about the money, I care about being tricked into buying something because of a fake photo. Think twice before you spend money with this company. I give excellent review when they are deserved, check my record.
1,I purchased the Dritz Eyelet plier kit for making about 500 bookmarks for church. Purchased 1/8" eyelets in various colors. After dozens of attempts, ruined eyelets, and lots of frustration, I gave up and returned the blasted thing. Purchased a Making Memories instant eyelet setter today. It's gotta work better!!!
1,I would never buy this tape again.  I should have just used blue painters tape because this tape leaks terrible and left my project looking sloppy.
1,I'm relatively new to quilting and bought this as my first rotary cutter. I will say it worked well at first and since I hadn't own a rotary cutter before, I thought highly of it. After less than a week of quilting and cutting fabric, boy did the blade dull quickly! It was so difficult cutting, I had to use my hands and knees to push down with my weight just to cut and even after cutting, I had to continuously go back to use my small scissors to cut the pieces that did not cut through. I only cut 1-2 layers and even with one layer, it did not cut through all the way. Quite annoying so after a week, I was determined to buy a new rotary cutter. I did my research and bought the Olfa Quick Change 45mm rotary cutter. Talk about a world difference my new Olfa rotary cutter made! Now I know the difference between a good and bad rotary cutter. The Olfa one literally glides across fabric(s) effortlessly compared to this one--even when it was at its best. Had I known how crappy and quickly this one would dull, I would not have bought it. I would not recommend this product if you're going to use it repeatedly.
1,It holds 80 pencils, and questionable if it is leather.
1,the Pad is kind of dry im going to have to buy a refill and i haven't really used it...not impressed, not my first ink either i always store my ink pads upside down too keeps the ink on the pad surface.
1,Ok, not the best .
1,I use circular needles almost exclusively, the cords on this brand of needles is so stiff that it is irritating to work with.
1,Item wasn't sealed and wax spilt all over the box.
1,I ordered this because my old one got accidentally thrown away during a move, as it was packed alone in a box, and someone thought it was empty and tossed it.  This mat is NOT the same as it used to be.  It is very slick and the fabric slides all over.  There are no 1/2 and 1/4 and 1/8  inch marks anywhere except the boarder.  The old one had dashed lines in some parts with different measurements.  It IS self healing, but I have messed up cutting fabric a few times because its so slippery.  I am going to keep looking and maybe let this one be used by my kids if they need something to cut on for projects.
1,Hoped it would be good quality but as i rolled, the path started going off course and "destroyed" my small fabric  so i decided to use this only for paper craft.  Design idea is good but the red screw seems to loosen easily and blades seem weak but not sure; some of the fabric needed sharpening but i left it as it for paper cutting.  I just don't like it cutting off course and have to be so attentive every time.  I just want a clean crisp cut.
1,itzy bitzy
1,Way too much grease! I kept wiping it off, and it was still coming out. In all the tools I've purchased in the last two years, I've never had a pair of pliers with this much grease. I'm returning them.
1,Get the Uchida Deco Color instead.  They are both about the same color and quality, but the Uchida Deco Color is non-toxic per packaging. This Sakura Pen Touch does not have all the warnings on it that the Krylon pen has (the worst of the 3 brands I tried), but does not address toxicity on its packaging, which leads me to conclude it contains at least some toxic material.
1,I bought this to mark my rulers with as I cut pieces for quilting. The tape popped off several times, and I did not use it after.
1,It ended up being a child size face
1,Point on scissors not plated on one side. They don't cut well. Will be returning for refund
1,The ink is not the same as the ink on the ink pad.  It comes out more green than the linen color on the pad :(
1,I thought this was a cool buy at first. The bag tore two weeks after purchase. I had three balls of yarn and accessories in it. Smh it tore. Spend the money for quality products and don't settle. I sure won't.
1,Very hard to get too work sometimes and doesn't always want to work on some quilting threads and some needles.
1,Very poorly made and not quality steel for the tip
1,VERY hard to pull apart, even tried waxed paper in the layering.  I own the roller brush, it didn't help either.
1,I love the idea of how these stamps are packaged.  All in a stack, not taking up a  lot of room.  Unfortunately, they aren't good quality stamp pads.  The actual pad is really squishy so my block gets quite messy.  Also, half of them are very dry.  It is a pain to get my stamps fully wet.  Wouldn't buy them again.
1,This is a very misleading product.  I didn't think I needed to read the dimensions but obviously I did...	When it arrived it was TINY--see pics to compare to standard duct tape.  I will be returning it shortly.
1,Fiskars No. 8 Premier Easy Action Bent Scissors	https://www.amazon.com/Fiskars-No-8-Premier-Action-Scissors/dp/B00006IFNC/ref=pd_bxgy_201_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00006IFNC&pd_rd_r=526J23ZW8MH1M2KC50QG&pd_rd_w=aYOwi&pd_rd_wg=otoTM&psc=1&refR		these are the scissors i ordered.
1,Thought this was going to be great until I opened the package and one of the silk screens is a duplicate.  I did not get the four different that were supposed to be in the box.  Very annoying for the price.  But the three that are there look super interesting.  Can't wait to use them.
1,I purchased the Cricut Espressions 2 last November and I think I got a lemon.  The thing hasn't really worked right from the get go, wouldn't cut properly, touch screen would go out, would lose connect on online craftroom, etc.  I actually have found it easier to cut things out by hand or with a punch.
1,I am quite disappointed with the final outcome after using this colour. The colour is so much darker than what I see on the cover. Having said that, I would like to qualify that distress inks add a special antique look to your projects
1,I hate it and would not have spent the money had I read a review like mine......the part (round part that hold the pins) does not stay put on the bracelet part.  Plus the magnet in the part that holds the pins is NOT strong enough to hold the pins......they fall off during movement of the wrist....Don't waste your money and frustration.......
1,Stitch markers are made of very stiff brittle plastic.  They are difficult to close and lock.  And they break.  I have broken at least 1/2 dozen just in the first time use trying to close them.  Cheap plastic.  Not even close to the quality of Knitpicks.  Clover markers are still the best locking marker.
1,Didn't work well for me when I was transferring a pattern.
1,It's good but Very disappointing? u need to apply again and again to get a darker spot, and it's not that easy, because it can ruin your work, and once u like apply it again and again,the BRUSH starts to whiten the PAPER, for no reason, and it's really annoying	+if you're working on a large piece or something, this is good for u,	I'm sure there's alot better products than this,	I won't buy it again
1,bad product. the net was torn easily. i was very disapointed and returned the item
1,product does not come sharpened. Used a small amount of force on basswood and snapped one of the knives right of the handle. Cheaply made and not with purchasing even for a beginner. You get what you pay for.
1,NOT HUSQUVARNA BOBBINS
1,still haven't figure this one out, will try again. But thought not worth sending it back.
1,Only since 1 star is not an option. Awful markers for even a intermediate colorer to work with.
1,I have ordered these before, BUT THE ONES I RECEIVED TODAY are TOO SMALL. Immediately RETURNED.
1,I suppose good value for the amount but not clear at all should you go to even a playing card thick. Probbaly ok for thin glazes.
1,Not what i expected. I thing it would stay "tacky" after drying, but it's a permanent adhesive. The name is misleading. I was looking fora temporary adhesive
1,I rereceived different set of pencils, dewent
1,I have made many, many stockings and this one was the worst. The face is small and needs to be pre printed so that no embroidery is necessary on it. Very hard to get the mouth right. I will never make another one of these.	I have always been very good at embroidery but this was difficult.	I was so sick of it by the time I got it finished it wasn't even pretty. Hope you have better luck with it than I had.
1,Disappointed that I can't just buy one pen replacement.  Every local craft store sells only the box sets.  And, they are really not that easy to use.  You don't get a fine line.  They don't all flow evenly and fluidly.  Depending upon the fabric, I'm sure, its difficult to get it tight enough (tea towels - cotton) and it moves around, so you can end with fat lines and then thin lines.  So, no consistency in workability of the pens themselves.  You are not supposed to "squeeze" the tube when using it, which is nearly impossible.  And then you have to sometime push down so hard on the tip to get them to work that it's nearly impossible to only squeeze "gently."  A couple out of the box worked fairly well and I caught a quickly but fleeting glimpse of how fun these pens could be.  But, the rest worked just awful to be honest.  In addition, if you have any hand pain or arthritis issues, this is not a craft for you.  I'm not elderly, but I have hand pain issues, and after only a short time of use with the unease of the pens, my hands are really hurting.
1,It felt great in my hand, but it's difficult to actually hook the yarn. My work is dramatically slower using this hook.
1,As far as punching circles, this works fine.  The problem I have had with 2 of these circle punches is that the mechanism that locks it in the closed position interferes with the punch closing or punching, and the plastic slide comes off of the punch.  It's not a big deal to snap it back onto the punch, just an inconvenience.  I have lost one of the plastic lock pieces, so now that punch won't stay closed for storage.  In my opinion, it's reason enough to not buy this brand or style of punch again, but not reason enough to return it.
1,I am happy with these hooks they are slightly sharp and no doubt the reason why my too thin tropical fruit yarn is pulling apart. but for the other stronger yarn I have no problem with them.
1,These pens hardly worked.  As some other reviewers noted, if you are only going to use it for short sayings such as "happy birthday"  then they are fine, But I haven't gotten them to work on something that simple.  The ink is not fluid and the words come out half written.  This needs to be fixed by Silhouette!
1,Hurts my hand to twist it, I love the Derwent electric sharpener for sharpening.
1,product came totally broken!!!!!
1,Problems with cutting on light cardstock. Shims didn't seem to help. Too bad, because they are expensive and the results were disappointing.
1,Perhaps I misinterpreted the description, in which case this would have been my fault for ordering them.  They came with no glass or plastic to hold anything in.  So, it certainly was 'hollow'!  I get these and I can wear it on my thumb as a ring and that is just.... thumbs down.  C'mon.... really?  What am I going to do with these?  And to show one with charms inside?  That one had to have been placed on a table and then the charms dropped in, in order to take a picture.  Worthless.
1,These colors were only half pink the rest red.  The glitter was all types, stars, hearts, etc. And this would have been fine, but I wanted glitter.  Stars, etc look like shiney paper.  I was very disatisfied.  I won't be buying m.s. again soon.
1,PATTERN NOT ON MESH GRID.  NOT KID FRIENDLY
1,These are the worst hooks I have ever bought! The sizes are stamped on them incorrectly, even by metric standards. They are made of some sort of plastic then coated in a metal like finish. The heads are not deep enough to grab and hold the yarn for completing a stitch. However, the grips are removable. So I took them off and placed them on my old brand name hooks and now have relief for my arthritic hands and wrists.
1,Unless you wish to purchase a potential brush with uneven bristles, steer clear of this.  The brush didn't have a point as I have seen with other Loew Cornell brushes.  One side of the brush is so short that the bristles stick out almost horizontally, the other side is longer than the point of the brush, and the "point" of the brush is even crooked.  Thanks, Amazon, for making this right!
1,Needles are all dull-they don't felt. I had to replace them immediately. Very disappointed.
1,this is horrible paint and like tinted whipped  cream.  do not recommend at all
1,Horrible. This is definitely not for ceramic, glass or plastic. What a waist of money.
1,Not the width it says it is! I have it laid under a 57" inch wide cut of cotton fabric and it's still at least an inch too short on both sides. Considering this is supposed to be 58/60" wide I'm really disappointed.
1,You get what you pay for.  I paid for a cheap winder.  It "feels" cheap.		If I had more to spend, I'd get a better one.  It DOES work, but the skeins are loose in some areas and tight in others.  Also, PLEASE use caution.  **Don't clamp this winder to any really nice or expensive furniture.** The clamp that attaches it to surfaces WILL scratch said surfaces.
1,It clearly states 12 sheets; I received 1. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews saying they only received one. Amazon came through for me. I will be more careful in the future.
1,Unfortunately the pin cushion arrived in pink but listed and shown as yellow. Toooo much trouble to return. Would not order again.
1,Easy to melt, and it works into the molds very well BUT... when you actually use it, it leaves your hands feeling sticky! Won't purchase again.
1,The suction cups for this product do not hold at all.  Very disappointed by this product.
1,returned - must use with special machine.
1,Totally disappointed in this product.  As I got 3/4 of the way finished, I realized I didn't have enough of FOUR colors to finish the project.  I used some extra yarn from another rug (different shades) but still didn't have enough.  So here it sits, unfinished.  So disappointed.
1,way to small not worth the money.
1,I didn't like the Silhouette machine at all.  It was not user friendly what so ever!  My daughter in law had one and said that she had to continuously look on YouTube in hopes of learning anything about it.  I loved the Cricut as it is super user friendly...
1,Many of these pearls were joined together and another good number were not drilled through. Time consuming and easily chipped when you try to separate them. Not impressed. I won't be returning them because I had to use them for an order, but I won't be getting them again.
1,Overpriced (even for $12). Better as a MEDIUM than its usage. DARK PURPLY BLUE is what this strange color is and takes several layers.	Comes out to fast and the layers seek through. It also lacks shinyness I was looking for.. (dull). Is it black, is it purple is it blue? NO its strange darkly purple blue color. Not as pretty as midnight blue either so for me it doesn't do justice. So far I've only achieved success with it but using tip of the iceberg with a 1 different paint to make it darker, otherwise its useless paperweight & Id return it. Then again I've only bought this for experimentation and this	didnt pass.
1,I purchased the 11" x 15" Jack Richardson "Butcher Tray" from an Art Supply web-site as it was on sale.  The tray that I received had a domed bottom so that any/all water/color that was placed on my tray would immediately drain to the perimeter.  Thus my tray is useless as a mixing tray.  There is no missing or cracked enamel in it's finish and my tray has no sharp edges.  Perhaps, if this tray were 7" x 10" it might not be so domed?  Perhaps, if it were made of a thicker gauge steel it would not be  domed at all?  But, it is what it is cheap, ineffectual junk, that can not serve it's intended (myself) purpose - that of being a watercolor mixing tray.
1,Huge disappointment!!! I ordered one set of size 7 tips to test these before buying more. One of the tips broke the second time I used them. I had made only one small wash cloth and was starting a second washcloth when it snapped off at the metal base. I've been using KnitPicks Harmony needles for years and I've never had one of the break.		I love the concept of the square needles but they are way to fragile. Not worth the money or frustration of having your needle break half way through your project. It is KnitPicks for me from now on.
1,This is a 1/2 ounce or 14 grams of items that are so small and so sharp that I really can't think of anyway to use most of the stuff I received from Lisa Pavelka. I was really disappointed to find what the package contained and I was so excited to order it thinking I would get a few gears and other usable watch parts. In the picture, which had to have been taken with a microscope and then enlarged, it shows all kinds of cool stuff with none of these long cylinder shaped things that are like watch band pins (but aren't) and these are extremely sharp on both ends and it shows all kinds of cool gears and cogs, etc. As you can see from my pictures there are hardly any of those gears included, that are of any type of size that can be used. Most of the things are smaller than 2mm, which is small and there were a couple of screws and a watch face (about 10mm/1/2 inch). Quite a bit of the package items are also very sharp, razor sharp and so small that I couldn't pick them up with tweezers. I had to wet my finger an pick them up that way when I wanted to put them back in the small zip lock (2"by2"). These items barely filled half the tiny zip lock bag.		I am very disappointed with this item and its contents. I can't honestly recommend these to you and I wish I had of saved my money and tried to find this stuff by purchasing old wind up alarm clocks instead. Good luck to all of you on your search for steampunk stuff to decorate your ideas.		PS: I have to disagree with the person who said that these were pocket watch parts, I took apart a battery powered watch yesterday to see what was inside of it and found parts just like those that were included in this package. Watch parts??? How do you know for sure? That is something I would like to know!
1,I am not sure if I am doing something wrong, but I followed the tips on Tsukineko's website as well as youtube and others, and could not get anything to stick.  I was looking forward to stamping images and covering them with ultra fine glitter, but no matter what I did the glitter just fell off.
1,I had to tighten the tips onto the cables after every row.  I Gave up and bought an Addi set.
1,Do not buy this piece of crap! It's made of cheap, lightweight plastic, and the hooks gets caught and snagged every other row. Plus the yarn comes out of the tensioning device all of the time, making that part utterly useless. It doesn't matter what kind of yarn you use, or how fast or slow you turn the knob, you WILL have dropped stitches and snags. Every single time I try to knit something on this thing (five times, now) it has ended up dropping stitches or actually BREAKING THE YARN because the hook went between the plies. Do not waste your money on this! I wish I could take back the money, and the time I have spent on this thing. UGH!
1,I thought I could use these beads for learning, as I am a beginning beader. What I got from them was complete frustration. The sizes are completely inconsistent in all directions, with some being more like cylinders, others round, others deformed, too many unusable. The amount of each color is also inconsistent; so, for example, you cannot practice a crocheted rope if you want to keep the colors the same throughout.		Also, the colors you get look nothing like the picture on Amazon. That picture looks like a beautiful rainbow of colors - even two pinks; I got no pinks, no bright blue (just an ugly pale blue), no purple. And even though it says "silver-lined beads" in the title, only half of them are. The rest are opaque shiny or opaque matte. But if you love brown, you're in luck - lots of brown beads, both matte and shiny opaque, and probably 25 more matte than yellow and light blue, and 15 more than the icky aqua.		I was very disappointed in these and will send them back. Even if the cost had been $5 instead of almost $12 (though I see today that the price has dropped to $8.97), they wouldn't have been worth it for the time I wasted with them. The only thing I liked was the Tic-Tac-like individual storage containers (24 in all) and the box that holds them, but I think I can find that or something similar at Michael's and pay less (especially with their frequent 40 percent off coupon).		The variation in reviews makes me wonder if the product you get varies as much as the beads - i.e., some people get what's pictured, others get what I got.		P.S. Happily, when I just called Amazon about the return, the CS rep told me they would refund my money, don't bother with the return. So, I can toss the beads and use the containers.
1,I have wanted to write a review about these scissors ever since the day I received them. I have been sewing for 50 years on a daily basis, it's what I do for a living. These are the worst scissors I have ever owned, so incredibly uncomfortable on the hand. In under a minute my thumb has a huge dent in it. They are also clumsy and are very hard to manage. They don't glide along like other scissors do. I have owned Gingher's for years and just love them. I will be making the switch back as soon as possible. Don't waste your money if you are a serious sewer!
1,This thing is frustrating.  You can either get a brilliant garment or get a dropped stitch that ruins all the work before it.  I put it away for the the warm weather and when I took it back out all it did was drop stitches.  Really tired of it.  Not worth the money
1,ridiculous product - hard to get on - slips off and does not stay in place
1,As soon as I removed the packaging the product head was loose. Not only that I should have paid closer attention to the reviewers who also experienced this same problem when using it several times. Sometimes even after reading and finding mixed reviews you take a chance and see what you'll end up with. In this situation I got a damaged item. I don't think I will reorder largely because there was very little care to the packaging itself. It was in light bubble wrapped envelope but the package should have more secured especially in the head area. All you need to extra bubble wrap around the head. I don't think it would increase the shipping cost all that much but that's my opinion. I am now in search of another chasing hammer that is slightly domed. Hopefully it will not come damaged but one never knows what will happen........
1,This didn't work for me. I don't remember pressing so hard on this when i was young. Sewing should be relaxing not taxing.
1,The recycled sari silk looks like what I want, however I haven't taken it out of the box because it STINKS. It smells so bad. Why wasn't this laundered before it was shipped to people.		Debating if I should return it or throw it away. It smells really really bad
1,The felt leaves threads on the artwork
1,Broke into a million pieces in the field, and the light flickers.
