0,This thing is huge, but does not feel or look "industrial strength."  It fits nicely into the sink and empties quickly with the design of multiple tiny holes. The rubber grips and rim of the strainer give it a finished look while providing comfortable handling and storage.
0,I have been transitioning my family off Teflon pans for the past year and have been searching high and low for a good pan for eggs, omelets and the like.  We use Lodge Logic cast iron for most of our heavy duty cooking, especially if we need to sear meat and then finish it in the oven but cast iron causes eggs to stick like nuts unless you use crazy amounts of oil (not super healthy...).  I was looking on Amazon for a good nonstick frying pan that was healthy to cook in and found this.  The price was right so I figured I would try it ($28.95 when I bought it, August 2011).  It was a lot less expensive than other non-stick pans that are PTFE and PFOA free so it was a low risk purchase - and one that I am glad that I made.  We have had it about a month now and cooked bacon, eggs, omelets and French Toast in it and have been very happy.  You only need to use a small amount of oil for cooking (we use a teaspoon or less), and had success with cooking one egg with a spray of Pam only.  As with all non-stick pans, you should not use metal to cook in this pan because it can scratch the nonstick coating.  We like the color and the size.  My one gripe is the handle.  If the handle was a little sturdier/more heavy duty, I would have given this pan 5 stars.  It just doesn't feel very sturdy, although we haven't had any problems with it, I anticipate that I might need to tinker with it to keep it on down the road.  This pan is good for what it is: an inexpensive nonstick pan that is PTFE and PFOA free.  Don't use too much oil or put on too high a heat (follow the directions), and don't clean when it is hot.  I like this pan so much that I plan to buy one for my dad for Christmas - hopefully this pan will make it easier for him to part with his Teflon pans!
0,Straightforward and durable. Dishwasher safe.
0,I like the light feature and it works well at humidifying the room.
0,Great nightstand!
0,Great pan - deep enough for lasagne as well!
0,I LOVE TGAT IT PICKS UP LIQUID TOO!!	We had a XXL- Milkshake.  It got knocked over he started trying to clean it up with paper towels and I was just GOING  everywhere and then I remembered I had got your little handheld vacuum and OMG PROBELWEM SOLVED!!!!!
0,FANTASTIC food storage product. I own both sizes available, use them daily in my packed lunches. Reliably LEAKPROOF,and stay standing instead of doing the old Rubbermaid weeble-woble.
0,Great quality!
0,Nuwave is the best - we will be getting more pots/pans - different sizes
0,Great additional to my daughter room. She loves it. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble.
0,this is my second one, love these, but it looks red	it's really burgandy
0,good bed spread and pillow shams
0,very good!
0,Very sturdy. Very handy. My closet seems so organized!
0,it has velcro on it which is a plus :)	good quality i think havnt washed so i don't know how long will hold up	but seems to be good ;) cant wait to use it!
0,Great deal and fast delivery, thank you!!!
0,worked great fro all my fruits and some veges.  The only vegetable I didn't see were it extended the life of it was lettuce, but otherwise I would highly recommend it
0,this is an aftermarket rack that fits in my old canner - it is a little lightweight - in that someone has to steady it before a few jars are strategically placed - but it revived the old canner so i am glad to have it!
0,I really wanted an actual wood slat mat, but this was so inexpensive and I was impatient to just place an order to get my new bathroom set up. It was still in my basket when I submitted my order for a shower organizer and some towels ... I don't think I even ordered it on purpose and might have removed it from my cart if I had noticed it was still there.		That said, I am surprised at how nice this mat is given how inexpensive it was.  I love it.		1. It looks like an actual wood slatted mat.  Yes, it's flat on the floor, but it still looks like wood.		2. It's large		3. It doesn't slip		4. It's actually just very nice and fits into a spa theme.		I'm really glad that I ordered this and not a bulky thick wood "mat."  The fact that it can roll up and be put away or hand over the side of the tub is a nice bonus.		I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again or recommend it.
0,I love this runner! It looks great & doesn' slide on the tile.
0,This is an awesome timer!  I use this in my kitchen (but can also be used in classrooms).  It comes with a little wrist band if you want to wear it around but it also has a mini stand to prop it and it's magnetized. It has four functions: start/stop, minutes, seconds, hours and hold. The ring is loud (beeps) when the timer goes off. From other reviewers they are stating it's hard "reset" or since the magnet is not as thick it could fall off the fridge when messing with the buttons.  I'm not sure how to feel about that, because when my timer goes off, I take the timer off the fridge to turn it off - no matter what. Resetting wasn't a problem for me - just follow the directions!  This uses 3 AAA batteries.  I've paid much more for kitchen or classroom timers (usually around $15 or more) so the value for this one is very good, in my honest opinion. I did receive a discount to try this and detail my review.  Hopefully, it was helpful.
0,Nice blender - does not always do a great job with lighter items (making bread crumbs for example).  But, for the most part it does a really good job.  I use if to make smoothies and soups pretty regularly and would definitely buy it again.
0,I bought this for my mom for mothers day. She lives in California and I'm in Arizona, but we are still close..She loved it!
0,I LOVE this little rug!
0,Awesome tv stand holds my 55 inch perfect only took a little time to put together and looks great  holds DVD player and other stuff
0,Glass is thick and the product was easy to put together it looks really nice with lighting underneath very happy with the purchase
0,Fun kitchen item. So many things you can do with it. Great quality.
0,These are very lightweight, have no magnet on the bottoms, but they don't rise or anything, they stay put in the shower, easy to clean. Great, simple design.
0,Super cute, and worked well. The package they came in wasn't great...but I didn't need it.
0,This pan is a joy to use.  It is heavy enough, and holds heat nicely.  Heat up gradually because it will not cool fast.  It is large enough for two people having grilled veggies, fish or whatever.  It will also work for steaks or burgers for four.  However, it is not massive, which is another reason we love it.
0,Mother's Day present that our mom loved!
0,Thanks
0,I got this for one of my son's coins in his collection of coins he has collected from various countries he has traveled to for business. Using a bezel to hold the coin made a striking display. He was very pleased, and so was I.
0,Risers worked perfect to raise furniture to multiple levels. Worked for raising my bed and coffee table. Perfect!!!!
0,loved it and then burned it out - may or may not buy another
0,I have two of these rugs now and love them! I have pets, so having an expensive rug is out of the question. For under $100, these rugs are beautiful and seem to be able to handle the traffic. They really warm up the room!
0,love love love this!
0,Beautiful! Just what I wanted!!
0,This is a great fan has 3 speeds not two as mentioned in other reviews.  For the High volume of air it pumps I find the sound very acceptable particularly on the lower speeds.  love the metal blades.
0,Kids, pets and spouses all wreak havoc on my carpets.  I couldn't believe this machine was able to get out months old stains from a white hand woven Indian carpet, but it did.  I had rented a rug-doctor from my local grocery store, the rental cost about half as much as what it cost to buy this machine and it didn't take out half the stains this guy does. No more expensive heavy rentals for me.  I can keep this in my apartment and keep my rugs clean.  Easy to operate and clean. Absolutely love it.
0,So glad i bought this. Very easy to put up and use.
0,Had previously bought a different type and brand, hard white plastic and thing. Horrible, took several minutes to pop and then no korevthan half were popped and the rest burned. I decided to give this one a try and what a difference! Pops quickly, almost all the kernels. Have used it three times in two days. Love it.
0,I bought this to use as a water pre-filter for camping/hiking.  I use it when filtering water from a creek/river/lake/pond etc.  I use it to pre-filter and remove leaves/silt/debris before using my First Need XL water filter.  It does the job and it dries fast/folds into a teeny piece and basically performs the job I intended.  This extends the life of my water filter.
0,It is exactly like pictured. So easy to put together. It came fast and well packaged without any damage. Very sturdy, and heavy period good quality. I'm using mine as a vanity and the drawer is just big enough to tuck away the items I don't want displayed.		If I were Furnishing a house and needed desks or vanities I would definitely keep buying this kind. I even use it for a buffet table, and extra dining seating when needed. It Blends well with all of my furniture.
0,There is "enamel-over-cast-iron" and then there is enamel-over-cast-iron.  This is the latter.  If you're looking for high quality, buy this.  Having cooked in this, as well as the Martha Stewart brand and the Le Creuset, this one is as good (and better than Martha's).  And cheaper.  Great for sauteing onions and mushrooms and then adding everything else, without the need to dirty a skillet/saute pan.  Right into the oven it goes, too.		Handles are *hot* little mamas, so use hotpads.  Lid knob won't get super warm, but use hotpads, anyway.  Lid is nice and tight; no reason to put a piece of foil or parchment paper between pot and lid to trap moisture.		The black rubber things are "bumpers" for storing the lid on top of the pot, so as not to scratch the ceramic coating during storage - things tend to get knocked around inside cabinets, especially if the chef is enjoying "help".  The company thoughtfully provides an extra set - a good thing bcs my dog ate one before I figured out they were not just shipping packaging.		Well thought-out, well-made, and well worthy of your purchase.	mb
0,Looks nice.  Chrome,  brushed nickel,  and onyx. Super excited about putting it in the new bathroom!
0,No scent just what i wanted
0,Haven't used alot yet but so far it seems to work great.  I love the length of the upholstery hose.  Most cleaners don't have a long enough hose.
0,Love the look and feel of my new coffee cup! The grip makes this super easy to carry and travel around with (and so it's not too hot) and I love the quality of this cup. Seems to keep the drink really hot/cold for a while after pouring, and the seal is tight enough so nothing will spill out when it's shut!
0,Great item. I have used this when making the Bouchon from Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery Cookbook. This is the perfect size. A double recipe from Keller's book will fill this a little over 3 times to yield 50 something bouchons. A great pan. Completely nonstick in my hands, good quality, just the right size. No complaints!
0,Beautiful well faceted stones.  Even better than the pictures and excellent energy.  So glad I got this.  Great value.
0,Great chair for the price.
0,I've only had this a couple of months, so I don't know how it will hold up, but it works great for me. It's not a necessity for yogurt-making, but by holding a steady optimal temperature it produces very reliable results compared to the methods I was using before to develop the yogurt. Be aware that your yogurt might be done more quickly when you use this.	The only thing I slightly dislike is that the containers inside are plastic. If you prefer not to eat food from heated plastic, I found that it worked fine to use a quart glass jar inside.
0,This mug is stylish and looks cool in any kitchen. It is also pretty strong and doesn't break easily if accidentally pushed off a counter. The only drawback is you can't put it in the dishwasher. These have to be cleaned by hand.
0,Perfect!
0,great product

0,Extremely impressed
0,I like it... but. Well, let's do this.		Pros;	. Huge water area. This water jug beats the rest as far as I know with that.		. Fills up very, very fast. No waiting. Fill it up in a minute, put it in the fridge, done.		Cons;	. The hose is pretty short. There can't be anything in my sink in order to fill it up. I'm staring to wish I had a higher faucet.		. The attachment for the hose doesn't allow for a twisting spray head, from what I can see... which is a bit of an inconvenience. So I really traded one convenience [a better water jug] for another [water doesn't reach all corners of my sink anymore. Washing things by hand is harder.]
0,Exactly as described.  Good weight and the three different sizes makes it easy to choose based on your planned meal.
0,Got this to go in front of my new washer and dryer combo. Looks great!!!
0,I purchased this for someone who lives out of the country where heat isn't a standard feature in homes. You either wear extra clothes , have a gas heater, or an electric one.	The Lifesmart Infrared Heater works great! The built in thermostat helps keep your electricity bill manageable,  and keeps you very comfortable.		No complaints, just many thanks.		Great value and price .
0,Talk about the perfect cooks tool.  I never know where to place the hot liduntil now.  Everyone is getting one for their next birthday!
0,It just arrived today and the setup was simple. The product is as advertised. The space underneath is huge as you can store stuff there if you're tight on space like me!
0,Works well! Looks pretty much exactly as shown in picture
0,I used to have a very cheap tea strainer and the problem with it was that the handle was heavier than the bowl so I had to use one hand to keep it in place while I poured with the other hand.  This one is balanced so it does not tip.
0,Perfect pop of color in my new kitchen!
0,I love these blinds. They block out the light, and offers the privacy our guest bathroom needed. We are using these in our 1st floor bathroom for greater privacy than the frosted glass offers. Excellent choice.
0,Been working great to get my pre-teen out of bed in the morning.
0,Love mine! I wouldnt change anything about it!!!!!
0,Made in the U.S.A. with the quality I expected! Let's see more of this!
0,just as described
0,This is a sturdy, well-built bottle drying tree.  I use 1-step sanitizer before bottling my home-brew.  Each row of bottle holders screws apart, making the tree easy to sanitize.  The base is broad, making it sturdy even when fully loaded.  There are two design flaws that keep me from giving this drying tree a perfect rating.  First, 45 is a bad number.  One more tier (9 bottles) would be ideal for 5-gallon homebrew batches.  Also, the threading is not perfect, so the nubs are not perfectly staggered between rows, leading to bottles in different rows banging into each other.
0,All very well thanks
0,We sent these to exchange students in Norway, Denmark, and Switzerland.  Postage is really expensive for sending bulky or heavy gifts, but these ornaments are light weight and fit inside a Christmas card and mailed for about $1.00!  We received solid bronze ornaments instead of the painted ones that were advertised.  We didn't have time to reorder and our students weren't aware so all was okay!  It had most of the places in Oregon where we had taken them and they and their families loved them!
0,Great little kettle!
0,This really comes in handy for portion control and for cooking.  It's calibrated to the hundredth of an ounce, and it's very accurate.
0,Works great with zucchini and summer squash.  So far my experience with cucumbers is that they are too watery - I have to drain them well after I spiralize them and they don't spiralize well.  I haven't tried it with other veggies.  I like the effect - otherwise I wouldn't bother.
0,I already had one of these for my old recliner.  Got this for the new one.  Makes it much easier on old joints when using the recliner handle.
0,Way too lightweight for me, but my guys like it a lot.
0,Bought this for a very reasonable price. I bought the other 3 in this same shape house to make a small  village vignette.  I am very happy with my purchase.
0,Mint
0,Like the look of the product and the removable inner pail.  The charcoal filter just kind of sits in the top and it could be more secure. This unit is somewhat smaller than other compost pails we've had in the past. But the removable inner pail makes it a winner in my book.
0,So awesome and perfect and my coffee was hot all day! Also this is so convenient and kinda cute to be honest
0,Works perfect in my truck :) I like it! I have a dog so this helps me be able to breath! :)
0,I've been looking for a heavy duty cheese slicer that is adjustable. AND reasonably priced. This one fits the bill on all counts. Shopping is limited where I live now so Amazon has become my new 'go to.' THANKS!
0,So Beautiful!!!!
0,I place this by my washer/dryer. It does a great job & creates a tad bit of white noise which I like, not too loud, yet reminds me it's on when I walk by (otherwise i'd forget & leave it on forever).
0,Better than I expected for the price.  I was worried about picking up fried foods from oil since they look plastic but there has been no problem.  Both of them feel solid enough and I am able to pick up a tortilla from a griddle so they are capable of fine actions.  Great "bang for the buck" as far as I'm concerned!
0,These little mini ornaments were exactly what I wanted to finish a project. They were well made and very colorful. I was so pleased I'm going to order another set!
0,I could not be more pleased with my purchase.  The finish is beautiful.  I was able to put it together myself with only a screw driver and the chair is stronger than i imagined. I order this desk because of the price. much lower than department or specialty stores in my area.  I  recommend this product . Five stars!!!
0,Nice cast iron pan, love it.  After heat up can cook with it on low on glass top stove just fine.
0,Great fit identical to original.
0,This basket is going to be great for stuffed bell peppers as well as other things. Rough edges at the top, but I understand some people just filed them down.
0,Will buy a piece  a month. Absolutely the best cookware I have ever had.
0,Words well.
0,okay
0,Perfect!
0,Nice magnet
0,Excellent paring knife.  Fits well in your hand, sharp and holds an edge.  Versatile and nimble.  I wish I had purchased about 4 more.
0,I chose this rating because I haven't seen the chair yet--it is a Christmas gift.  My daughter tells me that it looks really nice and I'm hoping it is just what my granddaughter wanted.
0,great for rolls & flour tortillas- holds heat for a long time.  it has a big opening that you can't close so we keep a clothes pin handy to retain heat even better.
0,Very cute and well made
0,They ar very long, so the protection is superior !!
0,Something about this texture drives my cat crazy. She loves them but they are a little bit smaller than I expected
0,I absolutely love these trays. They are very durable, and the finish on them are beautiful! I would definitely recommend to anyone wanted a dark stain set.
0,I lusted after this mixer for a little over a year before I finally broke down and purchased it.  Of course, it's everything it says it is and then some!  I highly recommend this mixer to people who have a passion for cooking/baking.  Also, it has some pretty nifty attachments!  :D
0,Love the size and durability. Many glasses this nice are $20 for a pair, but these solid glass cups are so affordable.		Would buy again.		Side note: I read the reviews on the "exploding cup" stories and bought anyway. We bought 18 glasses and gave dishwashed them several times with no issues. Clearly them shattering is not the norm.
0,Works as advertised.

0,Best coffee maker, EVER!
0,These are great, and I loved the tips and hints they sent along, too.
0,This is a well made gadget.  Good coffee cannot be made in dirty pots.  Bottom is 4 1/2" wide so fits most mugs, some small glass coffee pots and probably some travel urns.  I have a gold filter so I insert that and use #4 Melitta filters (Amazon has a great price for large supply - why not? you use them every day).  Use water just brought to the boil (coffee can burn); I use 4 of the conical shaped coffee spoons and 12 ounces of filtered water over fine ground coffee - pour half the water and get all the grounds wet then pour the rest.  I put 1 TBS. of 1/2&1/2 in the bottom of my mug. Vent on either side at bottom allows you to see when it's done filtering.  Top has "lip" for picking up without touching the filter.  Fresh, hot, clean, easy cup of great coffee.  Take it to the office - hopefully they have a hot pot of filtered water for the tea people.  Keep your coffee in an air tight glass jar - it helps preserve the coffee oil and keep in a cool (but not cold) dark place.
0,This is very good for Indian dhals and lentil cooking. With pressure cookers, there are spilling and foaming problems when you cook Indian dhals, and the kitchen needs to be cleaned constantly. The slow cooker does not have that probelm.		You can throw the dry lentils with water right before you leave for work and come back and have fully cooked lentils. If you want your lentils the first thing in the morning, start the cooking process right before you go to bed. You can reduce the cooking time by half for lentils, if you cook on high heat.		This slow cooker is quite large and I can cook lentils for big Indian parties.		It's very easy to wash. Just remove the pot and put it in the dishwasher.		I'd strongly recommend this product for Indian cooking.
0,Just hung it & it looks great!
0,Nice sturdy glasses and will go well with any china.
0,My wife said her sister was coming in from Europe and that I need to order a milk frother. I don't know anything about these so I looked at the Amazon reviews and ordered this one. Being lazy I figured one that took batteries would be better. Well, it works just fine. No problems of any sort.
0,perfect!
0,Just as pictured/described. Nice weight to it. Great for the upcoming holidays. Another nice piece to add to my growing collection.
0,Works as reviewed by others
0,So far I've only made meat loaves in this but these were easy to clean. I love making smaller versions of stuff, each of this mini pans makes enough meatloaf for 2-3 people
0,These were a great find! Their pretty and functional!!  You can't beat the price either. I would buy again!
0,It works well. The chopper can chop small amount of stuffs such as basil/ thyme/ chive. The measuring cup is too small for blending (liquid would go outside), but at least I can use it as a measuring cup in baking. The blender works well with egg. For blending smoothie, it potentially can work, but not very well, and without a closed container it might go everywhere. At first, I thought it can replace a blender such as Magic Bullet/ Nutri Bullet and Ninja (call me stupid please), then I figured that it's impossible, especially if you want to crush bigger and harder materials such as pieces of apple and banana. I did successfully use it to make green juice with leafy veggie and lots of water, but the consistency is not very satisfying. So finally I get a Ninja Kitchen System, and use this one for blending egg and chopping spice only. It's sad because I don't have to get it at all, as it can all be done with the blender. But hopefully this one is a little bit more convenient and easier to use when processing a small amount of solids or liquids.
0,A++
0,I bought for spare parts. Hopefully I'll never need them!
0,These were a gift for my musician/chef boyfriend and he loved them. We have added them to our utensil holder and been using them about a month with no problem. Fun little gift.
0,Beautifully made and well engineered; very easy to put together. However, it is much bigger than I realized, and when I hang on my bathroom door I cannot longer close it easily. Therefore, I have to unfortunately return it.
0,THE perfect tequila glass. The shape holds the herbal scent of the liquor right at the rim. The heavy base and overall shape of the glass make it easy and relaxing to hold. Sipping from this glass is pure pleasure. The glasses arrived perfect in heavy bubble wrap which is a nice upgrade from the usual thin bubble wrapping that tends to shift around inside the package. All glassware should come packaged like this. I just ordered a second set. This will also double as a perfect juice glass for breakfast.
0,Add a great western touch to any decor. We are using them outside and they have worked very good. They are not very long but still very cute
0,I LOVE my immersion blender. I have had it for about 3 years. I use it for soups mostly and its makes them much easier to blend vs having to put them into a processor or a blender.
0,Bought it as a gift and he loved it.
0,I'm very pleased with the cutters! I wanted the small heart cutter for Linzer cookies I made for Valentines's Day and it was perfect! I know I will definitely make use of the other shapes, most likely for baking.
0,We just got our tree, having lost a 16 yr old one in a flooded basement.  We have already lost a few small branches which is disappointing and there is a chemical smell that I hope will dissipate soon.  Time for the balsam fir candles!		No instructions in our box but how hard can it be to put 3 sections together and fluff the tree?		Our old tree had the cord to be connected to the wall coming from the bottom section.  Not this one.  The center section has the connection for top and then a long cord for the wall connection.  Logical mistake to put that one on the bottom but it did not fit correctly in the stand, after switching them out, everything fit together fine.		I wanted a tree that was not as broad as the old one and this one will fit our space perfect.  I think it will be beautiful once it is totally fluffed out and decorated.
0,Perfect for long neck beer bottles. The bristles are flexible enough to get through the neck without difficulty and spring back to clean the inside of the bottle quite well with just a few spins/pushes/pulls. The bottom and bottom corners are also coming clean nicely.
0,This is another item I included in my "quake kit", here in CA. The most reliable can opener on the market, it went to the space station.	Highly recommend it.
0,Good
0,Replaced an old one.
0,This is my new favorite kitchen tool, I've been eating so much healthier the past few days since I got it. I have used a spiralizer in the past, but it was much larger, harder to clean, and more difficult to turn which resulted in me getting rid of it. This tool is so easy to use, easy to clean, and the size is smaller and much more compact, making it great for travel as well.		I have noticed that the things I have in my kitchen which are hard to clean (like my juicer, for example), I will use for awhile then completely avoid. That is one of the many perks of this tool, you just rinse and use the little brush included to get the little pieces, which made my clean up time about 15 seconds.		This tool turned with ease with everything I've tried. 4 blades are included, which allows you to adjust the width of the noodle you want. The blades are extremely sharp and effective.		Another thing I absolutely loved was the little recipe book included with the spiralizer! I was a bit intimidated with the idea of raw pasta, but the recipe booklet includes simple recipes which I found to be completely inspiring. I have tried a couple of the recipes, both which were amazing. It was nice to get an idea of how to make a basic raw food sauce, and just get creative from there.
0,I am very happy with this toaster. Works great at a good price. I have no complaints.
0,great for the tight & small places
0,this product is the best! it took a while to get on but it fits perfect on an oversized recliner...the material feel fantastic...best decision yet!!
0,Nice product
0,I've had my previous Brita for about 4 years. Wanted to take that to another residence that we go to off and on so bought this new one. Pours much easier and no more worries about the seperate piece that my other one had that would often dislodge. A great buy!
0,Look great and let in a lot of natural light
0,Like the ease with the clips to hang any size pant leg and the non slip hanger for blouses!  Nicely done.
0,Does a great job.  Fits perfectly.  Durability will take time to evaluate.
0,Seem to work and fit just fine.  I bought them, thinking that they were the reason that my vacuum was losing suction. Turns out it was because SOMEONE sucked up a pencil with the hose and attachment, lodging it way further into the hose than I thought to look at first.  Eventually found the clog after removing a couple of screws, brackets, and twisting the hose to take it off. Might want to double check for clogs before buying this.  Now, I guess, I have a backup.
0,purchased for my baby sister going off to college, she loved it and said they were perfect and soft.
0,this is my second one, and I was so glad to find it!  the first one I'd had for years and years; finally, one sad day the element no longer heated up the water for my tea.
0,Just as described! Happy with these!
0,Awesome stuff!
0,The cafeteria at work switched their coffee and I very much dislike the new coffee and the free coffee in our department.  I started looking into what I could do at my desk and found this.  I've now tried it twice at home using an organic coffee I bought at Wegman's and ground on "Course" in the store.  Absolutely delicious!  I was astounded and so was my elderly mother.  I'm keeping that press at home and am back to buy another press for work.  Thanks, cafeteria, for making me try something new!  :-)
0,Nice cooking spoon works well noodles very sturdy and does not get too hot to handle.
0,The blade is very sharp and cuts through the watermelon like butter. I was able to make slices all the way down to the bottom and then turn the slicer over and squeeze the handle around the slice to pick it up. Whatever was left in the watermelon we used the baller that came with the slicer and made watermelon balls for my kids to eat. My daughter loved being able to help get the watermelon ready for everyone and i was even able to let her use the slicer once i showed her how to hold it. I orered this slicer because i have arthritis in my hands and the slicer i had at home was very hard to push down. This slicer works really well and its simple and easy to use,even with my hands i was able to use this slicer without asking my husband for help. I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a great slicer that is simple and easy to use.		*Disclaimer*"I received this product for testing purposes but I am under no obligation to write or leave a positive review.	The choice was purely my own and I received No  compensation."
0,This works perfectly as both a roasting rack and a trivet.
0,I needed a cake stand and while I could've bought many cheaper brand name cake stands, I went with the Le Creuset because of their reputation. It is beautiful deep red and it could almost be a display piece on a coffee table but the purpose of my buying it was specifically for presentation of cakes.
0,I smoke in one room only when I do it in the house to curtail the smokey smell overall, and I also use a smokeless ashtray.  I had a smaller air purifier in the room before I bought the HB, and it wasn't all that effective.		I definitely notice a difference in the air now with the new HB Air Tower!  After I finish a smoke, the smell doesn't linger as long and doesn't seem to carry out of the room as much.  The biggest plus is the automatic air sensor.  For the most part the purifier runs at minimal level, but it goes in to high gear whenever it senses a change in air quality.		I've used this for about 2 weeks now, and will update my review after my first cleaning.		I would definitely buy this product again.
0,Good product. Good price.
0,This item really does a "great" job on cleaning the garbage disposal.  It's worth the few dollars it cost.
0,I used this morning, I was slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes. The veg holder tool didn't hold the potato well, so used my hand and got cut. The slicer is good but is very sharp. So be careful, slicer attachments are as the pictures and work well. Nice long-term slicer at am affordable price just be careful to not cut your hand
0,I love the Axis Bathroom Shower Caddy from InterDesign.  It came already assembled.  There is one tiny clip that you insert over the shower nozzle and in front of the caddy to prevent it from sliding down the shower nozzle; two suction cups also assist in keeping it anchored in place and preventing it from swinging.  It takes approximately two minutes to open the shipping box, unwrap the caddy and install it inside the shower.  It holds all the toiletries that I once kept standing on the bathtubs rim.  These posed a tripping hazard, especially for my elderly parents who used this bathtub whenever they came for a visit.  I hung my washcloth from the rack and my backbrush and loofah from the two hooks.  Various shampoo/conditioners and liquid soaps were placed on the bottom rack.  The tub cleanser was stored on the top rack.		  The InterDesign rack doesnt interfere with me positioning the shower head.  It is also very easy to clean.  It is not supposed to rust.  The bars are made of steel, which have a thermobond rust resistant coating.  Most importantly, the caddy hasn't fallen.  I once owned a shower caddy that was made primarily of cheap plastic; it used suction cups and tension bars to hold it inside a corner.  It didn't work on my showers fiberglass walls; it kept falling.  (It was intended for tile and concrete walls that never move; fiberglass walls are too flexible.)  I finally gave up and threw the caddy into the garbage after it crashed down and bruised the top of my right foot.  The InterDesign shower caddy is attractive and functional and arrived pre-assembled.  Most importantly, it remains on my wall without falling and injuring me.
0,Fast shipping. Item just as described.
0,Cooks perfectly, although smaller than original.
0,beautiful piece of art
0,I LOVE these moth sachets. I have been using them for years in the "tropical" climates of New Orleans and Houston, and now in Ghana where they really fight off the insect critters as well as the musty odor that pervades any enclosed space. They seem to last for a really long time, too, and I mean years. They are great in the big plastic bins that I use to store my sewing supplies, as well as hanging in the closets or wardrobes.
0,Very easy to use cutting board oil.  It was obviously oily but think enough to not slide off the cutting board during use.  I have not previously used an oil on my cutting boards but was told that this was critical for bamboo boards.  Left no aftertaste.
0,Perfect for Christmas decorating.
0,I HATE the ironing board. This is so much easier.
0,Colander is made of high-quality stainless steel, with many very small holes that allow the water to move through and to drain small pasta or rice without it escaping through the holes. Strong base allows the product to sit in your sink without tipping over when draining
0,Moved into a small apartment, and this is literally the only silverware organizer I could find that fits my drawers. Does exactly what it says.
0,It was as described.
0,Works fantastic. Holds a large Kurig coffee maker just fine
0,No complaints, good, cheap scale. Make sure you calibrate it, but you can check Gingko's review for a detailed analysis of how accurate it can once calibrated. I believe it is listed in the manual as having a +/- 5mg accuracy.
0,This is a very soft and comfortable duvet cover for the price. I purchased it to replace my son's older, outdated duvet and he loves it.  It isn't the highest quality of fabric and stitching, but this is outweighed by the softness and coziness of the fabric and the fantastic price. I wish it came with the comforter ties on the inside, so the insert would stay put, but this is easily fixed for anyone handy with a needle and thread or sewing machine,
0,Cool for a small area, 10 minute burn.
0,Bought as a gift, the recipient seems to enjoy it and find it useful. Stack on is for the win!
0,I was so afraid that we'd have to replace our whole Eureka vacuum when the hose broke. Thankfully this hose saved us the trouble. I even like it better than the original one. This one seems a little more tightly coiled so that it stays clicked in snugly against the vacuum when it's stored, whereas the original hose was floppier and sometimes fell away from the vacuum even though we weren't trying to use the hose.
0,Perfect on the fireplace mantle. No tell-tell wires.  Beautiful!
0,Even though I didn't like the popcorn I bought with this. This apparatus did work well as promised.
0,Product stops most hair from going down the drain, so we have been using a lot less drain cleaner than before.  Easy clean-up also!
0,Beautifully constructed toilet brush.  Bristles are strong, and it cleans well with less elbow grease.  Very happy with my purchase.
0,I love this clock, it's the best one I ever had. The letters and numbers light up and I can see it so clearer now.
0,Great price much cheaper then any store I have been too. I love these and and bought them for most of my family members and they love them too.
0,You can achieve the same thing using a regular stainless spoon. This clever design does really work... if you handle onions/garlic and the soap isn't getting the smell out, then rub your hands on this amazing stainless sponge.		Not worth buying unless it's one sale.
0,Just another nice travel mug.
0,I have never owned a coffee grinder before so when my son gave me an Amazon gift certificate last Christmas I decided to try one. After a bit of research I learned that a burr grinder is best so I just picked a mid-priced one a ordered it. I also got a French coffee press so now I am ready to make a great cup of coffee. I've only used my Capresso 557.01 Burr Grinder once so far as I am making myself use up all the ready-ground coffee I had on hand first. It seems to work fine.. keeping it clean will surely get easier as I get used to it.
0,I've had the remanufactured Scooba for OVER a YEAR now and I love it!  My dark green laminate flooring was such a pain to clean, I had to go over it with towels to completely dry it every time I mopped it or it would show streaks from the mop.  I have a large home with a lot of hard floors (tile as well as laminate) so when I did take a day to mop, that seemed like just what it was, one COMPLETE day!  Now I just move things out of the way and set my Scooba to go.  It cleans for quite awhile on one charge and does an excellent job!  I have found the pool noodles work great for blocking off areas that are hard to block with the Virtual Walls.  Now instead of mopping once or twice a month, I mop at least oncea a week!
0,I can't find these locally anymore and was so happy to find them here online. These are my favorite cereal, soup, chili bowl. I've been using them for ages till my last one broke on the floor. I really like the rim on top which allows an easy and slip free ledge to grab onto. Also make a great small mixing bowl for a quick pancake or two for one or scrambling up eggs.
0,All of my friends compliment this scoop.
0,I was looking for something to heat and froth, but this works great and can be used for making hot chocolate too.
0,I love the scent of this. I use a ceramic oil warmer with a candle, not a charcoal block, so there is no interruption of the scent with awful chemicals. I would buy this again and I'm considering using it for medicinal purposes by dissolving some in olive oil.
0,I bought this for my wife to use at work. It has two temperature settings. She loves it. She is always getting called away from her desk. Now she comes back to heated rather than cold coffee. (It is well insulated and does not harm her desk.
0,love , bright just the right size
0,This is a well made single burner. It is broad and steady and appears ready to serve for a long time. But if you are looking for something to use for canning or making jam, this is NOT the one to get. I have a "modern" range with smooth glass top. I don't know why these things are so popular since they are so poor for serious cooking, but I am stuck with one for now. I tried making jam and the temperature cycles on/off, making my jams not set properly. I needed something that had a steady high heat and my range was not the thing. I also like to can, and since the range cycles on and off, it is not possible to have a steady heat for maintaining pressure. So since I could not buy a whole new range, I bought two single burners to try -- this one, which is not cheap, and another one, which was. I tried to use this one to can on and found out fast I could not; the unit cycles on/off and I could not use it for canning. The other cheaper one was an electric coil which did not have the on/off feature and which worked for me. I was able to can on it. I would wish that this Cuisinart unit was the one that worked because it is so much better made and steadier. That being said, I will use this burner as a spare for doing regular cooking when the demand is high but depend on the other cheaper one for canning and jam making.
0,Exactly what I needed!
0,small in size but works. I like it.
0,Love the large size. Can sit on top of a sink and easy to clean
0,The Scoops do as they are supposed to do, plus they will work as a 1/2 cup measure.
0,They are exactly what we needed...GREAT product.
0,Nice frame great price
0,As other reviewers have commented, these are rather large.  The description indicates 3", which is height, but they don't tell you that the width is 2.5" which makes for a pretty sizeable s/p shakers.  More importantly the holes are pretty large.  So these are good for young kids as they'll over-season very easily.  I use these by my stove top for seasoning main dishes, roasts, soups, etc.  I find them perfect for that as they won't need to be refilled too often due to their size.  It's too bad they don't make a size smaller with smaller holes which would be more appropriate for the dinner table.		Even though they aren't made out of the corelle glassware, they resemble it quite a bit, have a nice look and are easy to clean.
0,Bought these for old photos in picture frames and bags of photos to store under the bed.  They work nicely and zip up securely but they are very flimsy so if you use them for clothing or light items... perfect.  If you're storing heavier items, I would purchase another unit.
0,First of all, I couldn't insert the needle into my insulin container to extract the amount I needed.  So I had to remove the plunger and poor it in.  Second, there were no measurements on the side so I almost went into a diabetic comma from the incorrect dosage.  Then, to top it all off, I contacted the manufacturer and they were no help at all!  They acted like I was an idiot.  Needless to say, I will never buy more of their medical products again!
0,This product was originally given to me as a gift.  I then bought another one for a friend.  It is a MUST-HAVE!!  It perfectly scrapes the bowl and is dishwasher safe (a huge plus).
0,This is a gorgeous combination
0,Gorgeous
0,This thing works well. I have two bulging discs and this is great when I need to go the extra mile cleaning or doing computer work and my neck is starting to feel the fatigue.
0,GREAT!
0,Fit 10 inch Memory Foam mattress lovely and will be buying more thanks!!
0,Great machine.  Really gets the carpets clean.
0,This turned out to be a better purchase than I had expected.  Absolutely beautiful storage bench.
0,At those low price it as good.
0,A fabulous addition to any cook's cupboard!  I received one as a gift and have since given one to two other friends.  I can't think how I used to cook without it.  Whether you are cooking for one or a family, this definitely has a place among your pots and pans.  Every time I use it I think of other things to cook in it.  Steamed broccoli led me to a whole vegetable medley that is done in my microwave in no time and the cleanup takes mere seconds.  I wish I'd had these years ago.
0,Love them.  Getting more!  No more problem with those pans that have no lids... GREAT!
0,So cute.
0,Works great, perfect size.
0,Works excellent.  I live in Hawaii and the shades keep my room much cooler. Works as good as $100 blackout curtains.  I have them behind my curtains
0,Would not hesitate to by this unit and I did purchase it a second time. Of course nothing last forever so when my first one went searched for it again. Compact, and gives you a quick cup of coffee. I think Black & Decker did a nice job with this.
0,I purchased this film to give our garage windows some privacy but still let in a lot of light. The film was super easy to apply and looks great from both sides of the window. The little included squeegee was a life saver and made the application very fast.
0,I like this turntable! I bought a new TV and need a small turntable and this is perfect. It holds my TV steady and secure whenever we turn it, which is often. Highly recommended product.
0,These are the most comfortable sheets I have ever felt - I have purchased others for 5x the cost, but they are BY FAR the best.
0,I love the look of this coat rack.  It fits well on the wall and the hooks are sturdy and fold back.  It is plastic so don't expect it to hold a lot of weight but so far I have been able to hang coats and dry cleaning on all the hooks without any problems.
0,good price
0,Good!
0,Having to keep track of dress socks has become a chore...I have no clue what happens to them, but they vanish. I was stoked to have the opportunity to review these bags, and hopefully save some money on socks too! This pack contains 4 bags, 2 large- 1 black & 1 white, and 2 small- both white. They're a great quality "mesh" like fabric, the zippers are sturdy and don't snag. Our socks come out clean, as do other garments which benefit from a gentler cycle. I love being able to keep everything together and still have it come out clean!
0,I got this product for my wife who is pregnant and has a sciatica pain and she's been using it for two days and it has relieved much of her pain it works really nice and it's very comfortable almost like memory foam
0,Great attachment to a regular Ball or Kerr jar. Has not clogged so far, and is simple to assemble and clean. Have not noticed any rust yet either.
0,We are in the third summer with this thing. Have not taken it down and cleaned it yet. Will do that this winter. Our central air cost us $500 in the first three years of use, and I was ticked off. So, we went to two of these units and are keeping the house in control all summer in central Texas. I also believe we are saving money. If one dies, the cost of replacement is far lower than a visit from the air conditioning repairman.
0,Not bad, thanks!
0,Would purchase again.  Color is true to picture.  Material is soft.
0,I love these bowls... it is very handy to have all of the various sizes that come in this set. They are great bowls, and are super easy to clean. The one thing I will mention is that they are not very heavy gauge bowls. So if you are rough with your tools... they will likely dent. But that will have little to no impact on their function.
0,works great had to alter it to fit my Queen 4 post bed
0,I love dragonflys and I love that this is a pillow cover than can be taken off and cleaned.	Fabric is casual.
0,I like the material and the zip - but the case is a little big for a standard pillow!
0,Love it
0,This set was purchased to replace all of the loose knives I had accumulated over the years, and I am extremely happy with it.  The set is very compact, attractive on the kitchen shelf; and the knives themselves are very sharp.  I would recommend to anyone looking for quality knives.  I was also pleased with the excellent service provided by the seller.  Highly recommend.
0,Love them. Great value, nice size.
0,I knew when ordering it that it would be large, but it is clearly too large for a small kitchen. Other reviewers have noted good points/bad points. I'm not sure whether plastic shell is a negative or a positive. It certainly makes it lighter. Overall, very impressive. Just large.
0,Great pans, reliable seller. Do not put them in the dishwasher, they will lose their good looks.
0,I read the reviews and was hesitant about being able to put it together without a mallet, but it was super easy.  Did it in a few minutes.  I only used the top three tiers because I only was doing a small party.  Everyone loved the presentation.
0,looks great, nice quality, perfect size, we love the look of our new bedspread
0,Used these when traveling overseas for the Holidays. These are a must have when traveling and you have to put shoes and clothes in the same suitcase. Keep my shoes neatly stored without getting other clothes dirty. You can't beat the price; 5 bags for the same price other sellers are selling 1 or 2 bags.
0,Does exactly what it supposed to - lightweight, unbreakable and holds two dozen - plus a fun color - what more could you ask for?
0,Handy spatula ... design really helps to flip fish and/or burgers.  Withstands heat well even when using in cash iron skillet. Very happy with this.
0,Mattress is comfortable
0,Tree is as described<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/National-Tree-34-Feel-Real-34-Down-Swept-Douglas-Fir-Pencil-Slim-Hinged-Tree-with-350-Low-Voltage-Dual-LED-Lights-7-1-2-Feet/dp/B00MS7WQS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">National Tree "Feel-Real" Down Swept Douglas Fir Pencil Slim Hinged Tree with 350 Low Voltage Dual LED Lights, 7-1/2-Feet</a>. The branches can be adjusted to keep it compact or to spread out, and it's base is is around 30 inches spread out. It looks full but not not stuffed when spread out. It comes in three sections that are relatively easy to put together; just follow the directions included. Some of the inner branches are lighter in weight than the outer ones, but they are solidly connected to the stem. The branches at the top adjust so a topper will sit on the tree and a special set of lights can be put inside a topper or are hidden if you don't want lights.  The lights are fantastic.  You can control them by remote or with a pad on the cord to plug in the lights.  They can be white or colored or flashing.  There is about 9 inches of space under the tree so you can get a tree skirt under it easily.  The base has 4 sturdy legs and solid round footpads to hold up the tree.
0,I really love these rugs, I looked in so many stores trying to find black, brown tweed type slice rugs. I was so happy to find these, they look great in our kitchen.
0,A little misleading. The art does not fit the entire poster! There is a large white border around the art print.  Still, its beautiful and the print is clear.
0,AMAZING! I have spent hundreds of dollars for bedding while this little gem cost me only 20 dollars and feels great and looks so stylish!
0,I've had this pan for better than 8 years and it has lasted well.  Circulon has a great design philosophy - the circular grooves provide protected crannies for the nonstick to survive.  The tops of the grooves will suffer some loss of nonstick over the years, but the grooves ensure nonstick performance over the long haul.  The pans are made of decently heavy gauge anodyzed aluminum which is very heat responsive.  The nonstick finish is of good quality and is very tough.  This 100 open Everything pan is great for fritatas and other dishes that get finished in the broiler.  The two loop handles get into and out of the oven without fuss and handle the heat just fine.  The pan's suitability for braising raises the issue of the lid.  I, too, can't find a matching sized lid and have sometimes wished for one.  I've used tin foil - but this is a shame.  A great value except for the lid issue.
0,This is a fun pop set that you can put different types of things in the middle of your treat.  It's also a great small size for kids, as well as portion concious adults.  The delivery was fast, and the product was in great shape, as promised (new).
0,Very hand accessory if you have a small wash (not big enough for a dishwasher to be run, but you don't want to have a full drying rack! Rolls up and can be easily stored then not in use
0,Great for paring veggies.
0,For those hardened resin that require high heat to disperse the aroma, this item is good for using with sand in it, plus it gives kind of a mystical look to it,and it useful in such as in chants or meditation, emenating those special aromas creating desired atmosphere.
0,This caddy is amazing! It fits even the large bottles of shampoo, conditioner, or body wash that you get at those big box wholesale stores. I like that it hangs on the side of the shower instead of the actual shower head. It doesnt sway or pull on the shower head that can cause breakage to the plumbing. Its sturdy and I have been able to even pump out my shower gel without removing it from the rack. The caddy also has hooks for your hanging needs. Its perfect for little loofah poofs, shower brushes, or a little towel.
0,This was a great deal. I bought this over 6 months ago and upon setting up was a little skeptical about the durability of the metal framing however, after countless loads of Washing this has passed my test. The cloth hampers are a thick, washable, canvas type bag that can be stuffed and stuffed and won't tear or rip. The handles on each hamper bag is a nice solid feeling metal that isn't going to hurt your hands and the tips are lined with rubber to  protect as well. Being able to include wheels is a big huge help too.
0,You can say what you want but I hate the bagless vacuum cleaners. When I go to empty them I get that dust everywhere. The smell that they put into the room should be filtered and play havoc with my allergies. With the bag everything is contained.
0,its kind of big. LOL
0,Great product. Very well made.
0,Perfect for bathroom
0,These really are beautiful.  I can't wait for family to enjoy them during the holidays !!
0,Work great!
0,Returned them the color was not as excepted
0,I never used a mandolin before so I ordered this when I needs to thin slice potatoes. It is very easy to use, but very sharp so watch your fingers!
0,I bought this cute pillow cover for my mother. Her Siamese cat recently died, and he looked just like this cat on the pillow! The pillow picture was realistic, yet animated.  We were so impressed. My mother said she cried when she opened the package when it arrived at her house.	If you love Siamese cats, you should definitely buy this pillow case!!  Geta  12x12 in. pillow insert, and that is all you need!
0,Perfect cover and protection for our glass stove top.  We like the black color - it goes well with our appliances.  It can be washed as I expect over time it will get dirty.  Its nice and motrivates us to put the pots and pans away rather than leaving them on the stove.  Good product, I will buy again when and if it wears out.
0,My grandson took this to camp and he loves it. It is perfect because it uses batteries and needs no electricity. He used it constantly for 3 weeks, and it is still going strong.
0,For easy 'clean up' with a slow cooker these things are the Bee's Knees.
0,I have purchased and returned at least 8 mattress covers in the past 6 months ranging from $200-$20. Mattress pads either sleep too hot or are too intrusive and can be felt through my sheets. I've given up on "cooling" and just want something that doesn't trap the heat. This is a simple mattress pad for someone who just wants to sleep without roasting. My mattress is comfortable and I have no incontinent children so I don't need padding or a guarantee that a cup of pee won't permeate the mattress. This meets my needs and I am so thankful that I don't have to think about it again.
0,Worked for my hot sause
0,Wrapper the lights around one of the support bars of my pickup truck cover and secured the battery switch part with a piece of Gorilla duct tape.  Instant bed lights!  Super bright enough to see my entire bed in pitch dark.  I'm going to order more since there are a million uses for these fab little devices!
0,small foot print on my counter.  I've used it not just to grill meat, but to make cheapskate panini sandwiches.  Works well.
0,When our in-wall microwave went out and was a $1,000 to replace, we bought this counter top model instead. Having used it for months we couldn't be happier with that decision. Great tactile feel to the controls and its worked flawlessly. Looks expensive too!
0,These knives are pretty expensive but we expect them to last for many, many years which mitigates the cost.		We purchased these to replace similar knives we've had for over 20 years but with wooden handles that finally fell apart.  These have molded plastic handles and the blades are very similar to what we are replacing.  Plus, they are made by the same company that makes the Swiss Army knife.  How can you beat that?
0,I bought this for my daughter and she was delighted with the modern design and light and airy look .
0,Love this sheet set! Was leary of the price because how can you get good sheets for such a low price? I'm so happy I went for it. They are so soft! Washed them with no problem, not even a wrinkle. The deep pocket fit my bed perfectly. It was nice not to have to fight the bottom sheet to stay put! Haven't slept this good in a long time. Buying more sets for the rest of my beds.
0,Have had one of these for 25 years and still working. Got our new one for another bathroom and its just as good. Really keeps the towels warm.
0,Initially, I just intended to use this as a school organizing station since my kids really needed a separate space for their backpacks and eventually their over sized winter coats. Installation was simple although I needed to use longer screws than what was included to reach my studs. The hooks are extra long and generous. The result was impressive and looked so nice on the wall. So, after installing this, I am in the process of buying the 5 hook one to compliment.  I am thrilled to have my entry way looking so elegant!
0,I just need to toast bread and it is nice and small for easy storage.		So good for the price!
0,The best way of keeping your dirty clothes separated until laundry-day is using those hampers. I live alone and bought this to keep my dirty clothes, but I'll never get this full to the top. I guess this is actually a family-size hamper, but anyway, it is being convenient for me to use it.
0,I had to return this because the glass was cracked and the metal  was bent but I really like it.
0,This is the fourth Black and Decker Toast-R-Oven I have owned.  The first one I had for years and years and it was excellent.  the second one was beige and pretty good.  The third one was also white but they had somehow changed the design making it impossible to clean out the crumb tray right underneath the bottom heating element.  That caused several problems including - yes - the occasional little fire (all I had to do was blow it out).  It looks as if they made some changes now and this one looks as if it has a crumb tray which will be cleanable.		What I don't like is how they changed the dials.  It used to be much easier to toast - now you have to have one dial turned on before you can turn on the toaster dial.  Kind of too much.  Still - I bought this because .. I like the size for one thing.  Most toaster ovens are way too big for my somewhat limited counter space.  Plus - as I said - I've had these before and like them so what is the worst that can happen (besides another fire)?  It's inexpensive enough that I could toss it and buy something else.  Meanwhile I will enjoy it for toasting, cooking tv dinners, heating up meals that cannot be heated in the microwave, roasting garlic (why turn on the big oven to roast one head of garlic?) and so on.
0,Great float.
0,great for little ones.  my grandchildren love it.  easy to store
0,Works great with sugar cubes which my husband uses in his coffee as they are only half tsp. Nice appeal.
0,This works perfectly and is very nice looking. I got it for my son to go with the blue heavy tournament triple weighted chess set, so the blue light was nice.  I consulted my son before getting it because I had actually picked a smaller cool looking one but he told me the important thing was the thing you press when you're done. It has to be super easy to press and can't malfunction as that affects your chances in the game. So we chose one that had good reviews about that (the one I had picked specifically had complaints about pressing the button not working well).  He has used it and he says it works great, so mission accomplished!
0,The font for the day of week is clearer than the one on the other clock.  This is great for retirees wishing to keep track of the day of week.

0,great product excellent seller
0,I have been shopping around for a while. I love this headboard. Got it for my Cal King. It was heavy for me to get into bedroom by myself. But I was able to. I put it on the bed to assemble. No issues at all. The hard part was pulling a king memory foam mattress away from the wall. The head board was easy to stand up. I did not secure it in any way, just pushed the bed to hold it tight to the wall. My mattress is a little high and it fit perfectly. There is no rattling or noise. I love the material, a woven wheat. There were no imperfections at all. I am very happy with this purchase. The price was really good.
0,Cute lid for mason jars.  Plan to use as gifts with candy filled jars.
0,Absolutely love these pictures and can't beat the price.  I half expected them to be worthless based on how inexpensive they are.  But, instead I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  I've received many great compliments on them.
0,Well made. Enjoyed.
0,great. works good.
0,thanks
0,Just as expected
0,Excellent for paint or work with dangerous chemicals or dusts
0,I love this bed set! I have a dark wood bed bed frame/headboard, and with this, it looks like a comfy cabin setting. The bedspread is thick, and has a little weight to it, which I would prefer. It all fits well, I couldn't be happier with it.
0,Love it! No more shampoo bottles on the floor!
0,this is a work horse, I didn't realize my old unit was not working that well until this puppy came in.  Only regret is maybe should have gotten the bigger one.
0,Nice to have on your keychain!
0,have 3 of these clocks and are very happy with them and the co-operation of the company,  JOHN WAS VERY HELPFUL and explained	clearly to me my questions  THANK YOU JOHN and mesqool,  lard
0,I love my bedroom set I recommend this to everyone great price yes I wood buy from them again thank u so much
0,Could not be happier with this purchase. Top quality at a great price. I have used a couple times now and have made professional looking waffles that are crisp and flavorful each and every time. The stainless exterior and drip tray make for easy clean up. Each waffle is a meal in itself, at least for me. Deep waffle pattern holds all the butter and syrup you'll need, including any extra stuff you care to add.
0,Messermeister is a great brand; I've used their knife covers for the other couple knives I have. This is for a steak knife and it's just the  right size.
0,very useful. love the bright colors.
0,Great glasses for ice tea and other tall drinks. They clean well and are virtually unbreakable.
0,Good
0,As advertised- good quality
0,nice ,fast reiable thank you
0,We store bottles of liquid on their side in the refrigerator. These are very effective in the tightness of the fit. The plastic umbrella fits over most bottles and makes it easier to push down the thumb flap.
0,Love this. Smaller than expected, but holds my makeup and looks nice on my vanity.
0,Great quality poster! Love trying to identify all the various artist in this picture. Looks great framed.
0,Absolutely love them and I am ordering a second set. Price  was reasonable and they are beautiful in my bedroom!!
0,Bought this as a housewarming gift for my cousin and loved it! Its a cute bowl/spreader. I can see where the quality of the spreader is lacking (it could easily be bent with some force), but Mudpie stuff is just supposed to be adorable. I own a few Mudpie things myself, and I find the quality to be good enough and has lasted through several parties and dishwasher cycles.
0,No complaints. Well made.
0,Love this pillow.  Reshapes easily.  I opened it up to take out fill so it would fit into my pillow case.  I recommend using the pillow before taking out the fill as it does get softer with use.
0,Works great!
0,I could not give this 5 stars due to what was Advertised. It was supposed to be top of the line quality, and it really is only middle of the line quality. I did give 4 stars for delivery.
0,Very good price
0,Super cute balloons! They weren't kidding when they said the balloons are EXTRA large! The Letters are taller than my 4 yr old toddler! These do take up a lot of Helium so i actually decided not to fill them up with helium and just regular air. They were super cute with the decorations for the wedding shower!		received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for a review
0,These look funny but they are absolutely THE BEST at cleaning pots/pans and dishes that have dried on egg yolk, or fried gunk around the screw that holds the handle to an ALL CLAD  pan or in getting anything off any type of dish.		Pros	1.  dries quickly preventing mildew	2. Use a strong hook magnet  and stick the hook to side of refrigerator (side cannot see) and hang this cloth on it to dry and hide.	3.  Reusable.  This can be machine washed over and over.  I've had mine for years but buy extras to rotate so have some as others are being washed.	4.  This cleans the black  off the bottom of pans and coffee peculators so well they are like NEW.  Use only Cameo Aluminum & Stainless Steel Cleaner	with these scrub clothes and you will love washing dishes by hand and love your beautiful new looking pots and pans again.  I cleaned my neighbors burned gunky old pot which she loved spotless with this.  She tried other scrubbers and Ajax/Comet etc and her poor old pot still looked like garbage.  I told her not to throw it out but went next door got my Crown Choice cloth and Cameo and scrubbed her pot until it was shiny and new.  Cameo	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J5HJ2KI/ref=sxts_bia_sr_1_a_it?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=3182441022&pd_rd_wg=OEcud&pf_rd_r=JK2J57DXGTNKVYETJ9PE&pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-top-slot&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_i=B00J5HJ2KI&pd_rd_w=jHTc4&pf_rd_i=cameo&pd_rd_r=Z47YFDCKBDHEM1M81T80&ie=UTF8&qid=1506204615&sr=1	Cameo Aluminum & Stainless Steel Cleaner		.	CONS	NONE		 Absolutely forget buying those expensive cleaning cloths with the fancy scatchy material sewn onto them to scrub with.  What a waste of money as they don't work a quarter as well as these and the cloth is a mildew magnet.  I wish I had not purchased them.
0,Nice shelf for the price.  Assembly was easy, the posts are threaded and they simply twist together.  I used it in and office setting and have 2 printers on it, I found it to be plenty sturdy for the task.
0,Nice, solid tables.  No surprises here.  Also like the dark wood option which matches my tv stand.
0,Don't know what this item is for at time of purchase but it ends up being use as a reserve tank for mineral spirit.
0,Great little bottles perfect for making natural hand sani spray
0,Handy way to hang the tank tops more neatly than keeping them folded in drawers which gives them a crease.  Works as expected. Satisfied.
0,Great looking stand and easy to put together in about 15 minutes.
0,great
0,They worked just fine for my shower.
0,They are nice. Get some rubber bumpers for them though.
0,This product is really good i buy one for me and one for my mom and we both love it
0,I bought these and took on a cruise about a month ago.  They fit the cruise ship's lounge chairs great and the bright colors made it easy for people in our group to find the chairs.  They'll be nice to use around our pool this summer!
0,Best sleep since my back injury in 2000.  One cervical and five lumbar reconstructions later sleep had been rare. This mattress is perfect as far as softness in the top layer and firmness below. It gives support where needed and softness at pressure points. I had fits prior finding comfort in a mattress.  I was tossing and turning all night.  I never slept for more then an hour without waking. Now I wake just a couple of times durning the night.  I took to heart what other spinal patients had said in their reviews and I am very happy that I did and made the purchase.  Buying a mattress without trying it first was risk versus reward and the reward was huge.
0,I looked at a lot of knife sharpeners before deciding to purchase the SunrisePro Sharpener, Seems I made a good decision. My first impression was boy this is smaller that I expected, then I thought, it doesn't matter how big or small it is as long as it does the job. The suction that holds the unit down is great, I locked it down and sharpened several knives with no problem, the unit didn't move at all, the knife edges looked great and they cut better than when they were new. I am very pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to recommend this to family and friends.	Thank you for producing a great product that actually does what it says it will do.	I wish you and your company the best.	Sincerely Jerry Collins
0,Great price and very aesthetically appealing, but when I first took it out of the box, it has an unpleasant "plastic odor" smell....not super strong, but that kind of turned me off a bit...but after one shower, the smell is completely gone.  The material is pretty durable for this price.
0,Good price and ordering it beats hunting through stores that often do not have these.
0,These are the prettiest canisters I have ever seen.  They are wonderfully special!!
0,great blender
0,This is a show piece of furniture, we love it!
0,Plastic containers are so much fun to buy, right?  Not really but you can't live without them.  Got these on a daily special and it was a good deal.  The lids fit tight and secure and the quality is pretty good.  I will buy these again in a few months once we lose all of these.
0,Love the size of this sifter.  I have used it quite a few times since purchasing it.  A sifter like this is hard to find in a regular store.
0,This brush is exactly the tool needed to clean the Wine Enthusiast Vivid Wine Decanter.  I couldn't be more pleased!
0,Beautiful. Looks and works much like the photos posted. It is beautiful and calming, simple and easy to use.
0,OMG! SO soft I have to hide it from the rest of my family!
0,Good product worked well for treats
0,and also easy to wash and clean.
0,Great value and perfect for my beautiful fishbowl.  I purchased and returned others.  This one was THE KEEPER!
0,Bad ass poster
0,These diffuser sticks came on time and were beautifully packaged. They work very well. They are sturdy and just as described.
0,Believe it or not this is a quality piece of furniture.  Sturdy and amazingly priced.  We will add polyurethane to the chairs and top as they seem a little porous.
0,Cute mug, we purchased to give away with a coffee basket and wanted a mug that was not your every day coffee mug. Was a huge hit and I'd definitely purchase another one in the future.
0,This bowl is very durable and easy to handle.  I bought another brand before this and the handle broke off.  This  bowl is a great investment.
0,These were purchased as a prop for a sensory game for a child who needs to strengthen his hand grip.  They will work very well for that.  In addition, they are just the right size for many other uses in the kitchen.  I am very pleased with them.
0,like the shelf, the colored fabric is a nylon material, seems ok, great for the kids books, seems sturdy for what it is.
0,I have been searching for a 30 gallon trash can for my kitchen and could not find anything. I finally came across this one, and because of good reviews, I decided to buy it. It looks great in my kitchen and I love how big it is. The quality is great and I believe that this will last us a very long time. I really like how nice it actually looks as an indoor trash can. Instead of taking out the trash two to three times a day, we are taking it out maybe once a day. I did cut up the cardboard box to tape on the inside as suggested and the bag comes out very easily even when packed down and full.
0,I ordered this blanket for my daughter and she LOVES it!!  I love it!  It's so soft and a beautiful aqua color.  The edges are bound and looks like it will hold up nicely wash after wash.  Very thick and warm too!
0,I liked this bedrest so much that I bought a second one to match.  Much lighter than the old beanbag kind and quite comfortable.
0,I absolutely love this cake stand.  It perfect for icing cakes.  It rotates great and there's a lever that will lock it so it doesn't rotate if you don't want it to.  I wish it came with a cake cover, but it's definitely a great purchase; I use it all the time.  It can be frustrating to take apart, and I think it's dishwasher safe, but I hand-wash it every time.
0,Okay, I've tried every type of single-handed paper towel holder I can find.  They all have drawbacks.  Perfect Tear's ratcheting mechanism is great at first despite the noise but wears out in months.  Tried one two different times and have the second broken one right now.  Umbra Tug is too loose with a full roll and too stiff with an empty roll.  I brought that one to the office and still notice the problem especially with the empty roll.  Spring arms are fiddly and usually not stiff enough (I only tried one of this type, a SimpleHuman, but I returned it.)  I also have the SimpleHuman that's similar to this Polder, but it's too loose on a less than full roll if I remember right.  I stopped using it regularly a while back.		This Polder is the right thing.  I had one long enough to try it out.  There's nothing to break and it has just the right tension on the roll with both full and less than full rolls if I remember my trials correctly.  The problem with this one is something else, either Amazon handling or Polder's own packaging.  The first unit that arrived, the one I tried, was very scratched up on the base.  The second one actually arrived with the upright piece detached from the base.  Oops.  Now I've been waiting on the third one while it's out of stock.  It will be worth the wait, if it shows up in good shape....
0,The genuine deal, they work great and at a reduced price. They hold up well to many washings. Easy to slip on and off of steam mop.
0,Great for making hard toffee candy.
0,Absolutely gorgeous and I love it!!!
0,I like this product.  Simple style.  Lightweight.  Goes excellent with my decor.
0,Handy product.  You should have no problem with these if you rotate counter-clockwise just before securing in the clockwise position.  I see there were some complaints but not warranted if you follow my suggestion.
0,This spatula really makes icing a cake a lot easier. You have more control verses using a butter knife or regular spatula. Highly recommend if ur into all that baking .
0,Very good product, easy to use, easy to set and large variety of settings for every need.
0,as advertised
0,Needed simple, but solid candle holders for taper candles. These were perfect. The are heavy enough that the height of the taper does not lead to any instability and they reflect the light and look beautiful. Definitely recommend.
0,Great for those that have problems opening cans due to  mobility or health issues. Easy to use and well made. Takes up very little space unlike some of the large units.
0,Gift.
0,Very nice album, I love it.  Well worth the price
0,We used this as a closet "door". It's a beautiful touch to my 10yo daughter's room.
0,I seriously love this vegetable peeler/julienner.  The peeler is textured, not smooth, so the vegetable does end up with ridges on it which may bother some people.  I like it since it allows the peeler to grip better.  I am a little clumsy so I tend to cut myself with normal peelers.  The julienne side is very easy to use as well and works as intended.  It is very easy to clean so long as you do not let food dry on it.  I haven't even had to use the brush that comes with it.  It was worth a little extra money to get a peeler of this quality.
0,i thought this wouldve been heavier but nonetheless, it looks great
0,I bought this blender 15 years ago.  The graphics have changed, but the rest is exactly the same.  I used this every single day to crush ice and fruit until the gear in the base of the pitcher had a problem.  The gear is hard metal covered in clear soft plastic.  Eventually water came between the plastic and the metal,  and then over time  it rusted ( very very slighty).  This was not that big a deal since the gear is completely covered.  After about a year since I first notices this, the gear would get stuck in the base.  It took a little effort to remove.  The rust seemed to swell the plastic just enough so the gear would stick to the base.  Over time it just got worse.  To the point were I could lift the base with this ( the base is heavy).  Anyway, I called  Kitchen aid  and the swiftly  replaced the pitcher for free.  No receipt etc.  They even gave me a new top.  Since the base is perfect, it's like I just got a new blender.  That is great customer service!!!!!  Great blender. Can't think of anything that could make this better.  Maybe this ...  If it had a tamper tool, it would blend anything.
0,we live in south texas needless to say HOT HOT HOT  we like to sit outside and enjoy our back yard. it literally was unbearable, we decided we would try this cooler to see if it made a big enough difference and i am happy to say it really has we can sit outside and enjoy the porch it actually decreases the temperature by bout 20 degrees . really is wonderful
0,I absolutely love the look of this tree skirt. The only drawback is that it doesn't have any kind of fastener to attach the ends to one another and secure it around the tree base, but this is very minor.
0,I never write reviews, but I just had to on this machine.  If you don't like to cook, this machine is definitely for you.  I absolutely LOVE it, and I've only had it for a week now.  I use it in the mornings for my protein shake which includes, Dr. Mercola's Pro-Optimal Whey, a banana, coconut milk and a raw egg.  Delicious and holds me for almost 5 hours.  In the evenings I have a variety of fruit and green smoothies.  Clean-up is a breeze!!!  Three of my friends own a Vitamix and have for over 10 years, they rave about theirs.  I highly recommend the Vitamix to everyone!!!
0,good strop for the price. not a fan of the rough side for sharpening as it seems to dull my blades, but it does work great with the compound to polish the sides of my knives. the smoother side works great. the compound is a bit stiff, but it definitely works. you just have to rub it on like chalk.
0,I've had a Nespresso machine for years but wanted something updated and smaller on my countertop - this is it. Nespresso really makes quality products and their coffee tastes great. What more could you ask for?
0,Nice
0,Fits mason jars regular mouth! Blasts through Kale and frozen berries. Love it. Loud but works great! I like it better than my immersion blender and cuisinart personal blender - the mason jars are easier to clean and do not scratch like the cuisinart set. I love that you can switch blades and they are easy to purchase. Being able to turn this into a personal size blender with 9 ounce tall mason jars is a big deal.
0,I love making tea in my new teapot.  It's easy to pour and really love the color.  I would recommend it.
0,Nicely made, and a pretty color. Soft, once it has been washed.
0,Wow! My husband twisted my arm to get this. I was doing it by hand. Guess he was right :D
0,It's funny because I saw this at Whole Foods earlier this week and they had a sampler bottle. I shook it up and sprayed it on my arm. I thought it seemed slightly strong, so I went with something else. Well, as I was driving home and the scent began to warm on my skin, I fell in LOVE with it. I regretted not buying it at the store...so I am ordering some now.	It's awesome.	I am a huge fan of patchouli. If you are, too, I would highly recommend buying this!
0,I bought this based on recommendations from 2 coworkers.  I've already cooked, sealed, and frozen a lot of food.  I bought the roll of bags.  Of note, you have to seal one end  before you cut the bags for the size you want, and it has to be cut straight.  This is a great product.  I've already ordered more bags!
0,It's my new favorite in my kitchen!
0,Very nice!
0,I'm happy with the bedding set.  After washing once, I find the sheets and comforter to fairly soft and decent quality for the price.  The set looks great on my son's twin bed.  The comforter is thicker and slighty stiff.  Stays on the bed nicely.  Hoping it holds up after several washing.  So far so good.
0,We used these as our wedding favors and they seemed to go over well. We ordered extra which was good because quite a few of the keys came broken in their boxes.
0,Just what we needed to cover tables for our event.  We needed something that would roll out flat to cover tables where we display contest entries.  We used something sturdier on our food tables--I'm not sure these would stand up to spills--but we were very happy with this product and plan to purchase it again.
0,Ordered them for a friend and he wants more!
0,These sheets are the color that I expected. Very bright and bold purple. They fit the bed perfectly and are very soft
0,Got these for a full mattress. Fit well and nice and thick.
0,It is a light tight getting both shoes in and I wear a small size.
0,You will need more than one box...  isn't as much as it seems
0,Very slight differences in some of the lengths, but acceptable.  A little lighter weight than I expected but look great.  I would order again.
0,Love this. It is constructed well and works great.
0,Good jar does what it is supposed to do! Can't ask for more in today's world.
0,Nothing else we've tried comes close. Vornado fans are well made and effective despite their compact size, and customer service has been great when I've dealt with them on the past purchase of a space heater. The only brand we buy after having had many others over the years.
0,I bought this so my son (5) could squeeze lemons. Its great. I have to get it started for him but it's much easier than the ones you push down on.
0,Great knife set, although do not put in the dishwasher as they will start to rust.... slightly dissappear in that fact but overall great item
0,These are heavy high quality lights. Unlike other items purchased labeled outdoor I see these lasting. Easy to install.
0,Better than described, very pretty.
0,Does the job
0,Great little vacumn and very portable  I have 3 dogs and tile floors-enough said !-I can carry this around and suck up all of the hair. I also like the dirt cup that can be emptied easily--no expense for bags. I also recieved it really fast-good service
0,Product worked as described
0,Whoever designed these should get a high five!
0,My husband collects coins and wanted this to check weights against his books. He weighed pennies first for accuracy, and said this scale was very accurate. It fits easily in his shirt pocket so he can actually weigh coins at shows, pawn shops and coin shops. The gem20 then stores easily into his desk drawer.		Because the scale is calibrated to .001g it's perfect for small items.		This is a great little travel scale for both gems and coins.		Scale provided to test
0,Does the job.
0,Very nice flate ware,,,nuttin to say bad bout um,,,yet!!
0,Good sturdy scoop for large ice maker, very happy with it. Note if you leave it in the ice maker do not grab it with wet hands, like from rinsing out the cooler!!
0,This wine aerator works really well. It is also slim enough to be able to fit in any of several wine bottles I have tried, something that was not the case with another one I had. It presses in securely and pours plenty fast.		The fact that it can be taken apart for cleaning is really nice and it cleans up well in our dish washer.
0,easy to use, very lightweight, not for big heavy loads.
0,Grips firmly, holds hot canning jars to lift them out of the canner really well.
0,Beautiful
0,I think this garlic keeper is cute on my counter and does the job well. It fits a few heads of garlic at a time and keeps them nice and fresh.  It's small and a bit inconspicuous if you have a large counter.
0,awesome knives. The paring knife is a little weak but its super sharp and works great.
0,Works as described
0,This shower curtain is what I expected. Clear, easy to install and waterproof. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the loops aren't very sturdy. The plastic can tear easily if you're not careful during installation.
0,So far these bags are working well. They are very sturdy, and exactly what I was expecting. Will post an update in a few weeks/months to update how they are holding the seal.
0,Lightweight and serviceable, this is a good investment.  I bought it a couple of years ago and it's still serving me well.  I do recommend it as a good grocery cart.
0,My husband wanted candles in the window for Christmas but I didn't want to go around turning them on every night. These fit the bill by automatically turning themselves on at dusk. Worked well and consistently. Bulbs did not burn out and burned brightly. Really happy I purchased these.
0,Great wash cloths...I use wash cloths for my face and in place of hand towels. I the texture of these cloths..soft, soft and absorbent. Especially like I got package of 12 at great price.
0,Using them for storage during renovations.  Heavy duty.  Good quality.
0,Husband uses this lunch box almost every day and he likes it. Holds all his stuff and keeps it well with the use of cold packs. Good item! Well made.
0,This the BEST steamer I've ever owned. I have a bigger steamer by Shark (it's great for larger needs like drapes) but the PureSteam Portable is perfect for every day use. I could never iron my clothes without leaving  unwanted iron ceases. When I bought the PureSteam, it made prep process so much easier. From plugging it in to walking out the door takes no more than 15 minutes. I LOVE THIS STEAMER. I recommend it to everyone!
0,Out of the box R.A.Z.O.R. sharp.  Used it to cook dinner tonight, still razor sharp.  Will update once I've used it a while and had to resharpen it.
0,This is perfect! I never had a memory foam mattress, so I was worried this is going to be too soft, but it's just right. Very comfortable and no pain of any sort in the morning.
0,The perfect outdoor pillow covers for the patio in fall! The fabric is holding up really nicely weeks later, too. Thanks!
0,Great set of tools.
0,I take a lot of flak for being a sucker for gadgets I see on TV, but this one has finally vindicated me!  It's a true wonder and has cut down peeling time incredibly.  My old peeler was so much work I would usually end up just grabbing a paring knife and finishing the job with that.  This tool is literally effortless when it comes to peeling potatoes, etc.  We canned a bunch of squash this fall (over abundance in the garden) and I was not looking forward to "cleaning" them and separating the squash from the skin.  I tried the Titan and it even peeled thru the tough squash shell.  I cannot rave enough about this tool.  It's the best addition to the kitchen I've made in a long time.
0,Great quality and I love the look
0,Very classy looking, and high quality for the price.
0,These are nice towels. I find them to be of good thickness and very durable. They are worth the price.
0,i love these cups.  They are colorful and fun to use and are so much easier to store because they fold up flat.
0,I purchased this for my Mom for Mother's Day.  She grew up on the coast and loves these floats.  When I opened the box I was happily shocked at how gorgeous this is!  The photo does not do justice to the hemp rope or how it catches the sun, totally beautiful!		Thank you for this wonderful product!  When she wants more we will definitely be coming back!
0,It's spacious, it's so pretty to look at, and the bunny isn't cut off, it's looking to the flowers!	I can't write a good review, or extensive for that matter, just read on the other ones that have! they've done a great job and because of them, I bought it! I've missplaced the red rubber band and the divider within the Bento box, since it's just removable, I left it somewhere and now I can't find it. All in all, buy it, take care of it, it's nice to have it!!!
0,One amazing griddle !, Always wanted one for cooking breakfast and his one did not disappoint. Heats quickly and evenly LOTS of room for eggs, bacon, sausage etc all at once. Super easy to clean and store. The cord is a bit short, but considering it usually is used on the kitchen counter it is adequate. A definite 5 star purchase
0,It does exactly what it is suppose to do.	Easy to use, easy to clean and versatile.	Good item to have.
0,Have you ever used an ironing board that felt like it was going to break? This one doesn't. It's sturdy and stable, even with the hanger rack fully loaded. Despite some other reviewers' experiences, mine arrived adequately packaged for shipping and in fine condition. If I ever need another ironing board, I'll probably just come back to this one--but I doubt I will.
0,A little hard to get used to after having the upright, but it is a great vacuum. Not great for carpets, but does a terrific job on tile, hardwood, and vinyl.
0,I love this wine opener. it is so easy to use and looks nice on our bar! I have are had other wine openers and this one far surpasses them in performance. i highly recommend it.
0,I love the idea of an air purifier, but am very skeptical about how effective they can be. After reading the Consumer Reports articles about air purifiers, I am even more dubious, especially about the ionizing purifiers. But the pollen and dust have been extra rampant this year so I am willing to try almost anything.		This Frigidaire Anti-Allergen-180 2-stage is at the low end of the air purifier spectrum. It doesn't ionize, it only has one moving part (the fan) although it does have three speeds. It doesn't use HEPA filters, so this is really a bare bones unit. It sucks air in one end, through a filter that traps many (but not all) all of the dust and pollen particles and blows the air out the other side.		But here's the surprise: it works. I have been using it for almost two weeks, in different parts of the house, and have settled on keeping it in the bedroom. My allergies haven't disappeared, but I am able to sleep through the night. The dust and pollen have been reduced to a point where I don't wake up every few hours with my sinuses completely stuffed up and unable to breathe. This is quite an improvement. On the low speed, I can barely hear the unit. On medium speed, it's a bit louder but not a bother. The highest speed is quite loud and I only use that speed when I am vacuuming and for a while afterward, hoping the Frigidaire will grab the dust that was stirred up.		As a bonus, on the low speed which I keep the unit on overnight, it keeps the air moving enough so that the room stays comfortable, not as stuffy. To clean the filter, you vacuum it whenever you do your regular vacuuming. You have to replace the filter once a year or so.		Sometimes simple is all you need.
0,Even nicer in person! Solid, well made and beautiful in color.  It mounts easily and looks beautiful! Nice addition to wall collections.
0,This is a beautiful piece.
0,Blocks light very well. Material feels good to the touch and looks classy.		If you have light leaks, it's from the side of the curtains, and that's not the fault of the curtains.
0,I bought this for a bar of salt that I use in the shower sometimes. I was really upset this morning when I noticed salt that had melted and caked onto the holder, because I was sure it would be all rusty. I sprayed it down with the shower head, and the salt is gone, and no rust. Very nice.
0,Fast shipping, work great!  Thanks!
0,Works Good!
0,There are a some instructions on the back of the box that are in picture form. I folded 40 shirts as soon as I got the folder. My granddaughter loved helping me.
0,Should come as sets, instead of having to bake twice in one pan
0,Very happy with this purchase.  Need to order two more now that I know how good of quality it is for the price.  Very happy with this purchase.
0,So soft! Not as thick as k hoped. But it keep me warm and j like that botn sides are soft so it doesn't matter which way u put it on
0,Excellent quality, will last a long time.  Cooks everything well.  I used it for Thanksgiving for a turkey breast, it was just the right size.  A great alternative to a large size roasting pan.  Oh, I used it for lasagna, too!
0,this is a real nice foaming soap pump, I like it is marked so you know exactly how much soap and how much water, very nicely made
0,This is a fantastic can opener. Easy to use, works great. I love it! Makes opening cans a breeze without worry of sharp edges.
0,Glasses are great! They were actually what I already have, but more is always merrier! I love these for water, wine, juice, etc.	Shipping was great - came when expected. The packaging was a mess, however.
0,Exactly what I expected, an elegant long handled bar spoon, nicely priced and of good quality.  I would recommend!
0,Great to have right by your stove.	Good quality.  Easy to use.  No spills, which hasn't been the case with all products.
0,THANK YOU
0,lovely cake stand
0,Love this product! Once pops are frozen they are super easy to pop out of holder. Easy for baby to grasp. Great price!
0,I love the way this Fitted Sheet feels. It is easy to slide off of but that is perfectly fine for me. I love feel of satin and silk so this works great for me. The Color of the Champagne is a little to light for my room but I never really care if it matches 100% in the end. If I ever need another like this I'll be sure to pick another of these up.
0,After personalizing the bags in permanent marker, they looked better. The lining was not tacked down and tends to bunch up. Not as roomy as I thought.
0,This seems to be working perfectly. The rest is plenty large enough for any spoons, and since these are silicon they are incredibly easy to clean up.
0,Sharp and a great color!
0,Looking for something for guest bedroom and this is the perfect size and quality is great
0,works well
0,Product is actually an ice cube tray. I used it as a chocolate mold and while it was easy to push the chocolates out (the bottom is silicone), they were very thick. Would make cute ice cubes!
0,We bought this for our granddaughter to add to her Frozen collection. She loves Anna and has put this on her shelf. It is well made and very colorful. Shipping was great as always.
0,so far so good, campfire coffee with out the fire!
0,i have had this for a few weeks and so far so good
0,I purchased this cover for my DHP 6" futon mattress, and I am very pleased.  It fit pretty well with very little "slouchyness" on the corners, and the color is wonderful.  It has a canvas feel, and holds up quite nicely with our two Chihuahuas hopping up and down on the futon all the time to snuggle and watch TV.  I assume it will be easy to wash in the machine once the time comes.
0,Super heavy weight sheets, an unbelieveable thread count with a price that cannot be beat anywhere!!!! I bought one set got it and bought 2 more sets plus 2 sets of pillow cases!  Excellent!
0,This was so cute!!!
0,I've discovered that every new toaster relationship is unique. As with human relationships, the first go-round can either be a honeymoon or a nightmare, and then as we discover how to deal with their unexpected workings, we establish a rapport - a compromise that allows us to be more or less satisfied with an edible outcome.	And so it is with this Black+Decker model. It's true eye candy on my granite counter next to the black and silver refrigerator. It has a sexy gleam under the LED cabinet spotlight. Sort of a James Bond in a European tuxedo sleek look. But then I tried using it, and there was burnt bread flesh or under-cooked centers, uneven heat spots, failure to rise to the occasion even when elevating the lever. All sorts of fiddling with the "Frozen" button and temperature numbers. But like a marriage meant to last, we finally found ourselves in toasty agreement around the number 4, with the frozen button depressed after plunge, and unplugging the machine to stab out the toast from the elevated position. Partly my fault this, for preferring artisan breads of short stature and rich ingredients. Nevertheless, we have settled into what I hope will be a long relationship.
0,best popcorn popper on the market
0,I got my Hario coffee mill yesterday and ran right out and bought whole beans again. I set the Hario grinder as fine as possible (according to the video posted by Claire Jordan under the reviews of this product. Thanks Claire) and used the freshly ground coffee in my AeroPress coffee maker. Yum, I finally have really tasty coffee again.	P.S. We recently went camping in the Sawtooth National Forest and I took the AeroPress along to make coffee. Next time we go I will bring the hand grinder along and we shall enjoy wonderful coffee by the mountain streams.
0,Love it but it breaks easily. Half the strands broke off while I was taping it to the wall. The color is vibrant and beautiful but you need to be very careful when putting it up that it does not get tugged. It will break.
0,My toddler cannot live without her stool! lol she takes this stool everywhere
0,Was a Christmas gift and the quality was great! Thick material and the print was perfect.
0,This fits perfectly on my Shark Vacuum. Very easy to replace the filters. It's amazing replacing all 3 filters the amount of suction I was missing. My shark always worked great, but now it works like new.
0,Had an ancient Royal hand-held vacuum with metal parts. It was quite well-made, but after all the years it was nearly a goner. I started researching online and found that Royal makes this item. It was highly rated and I ordered it.		In the new model, the metal has been replaced by plastic, but does it ever have great cleaning power! I was impressed. I have a great cat with a very fluffy long black coat. I was finding his little "cocoons" of hair everywhere. And they would often work their way into fabrics and carpeting. This little wonder really worked to remove them amazingly well.		My only problem was mostly my own fault. I let the cord get sucked up by the vacuum and the coating was stripped in a few spots within moments (since repaired). Wish that the cord coating had been a bit more protective, but also wish that I hadn't been so careless about where the cord was when I was using it. The little Blue Dust Devil is very powerful  so keep the cord out of its way!
0,I like these, they are higher quality then walmart and keep the light out. Obviously some light will get in if there is a gap between the curtain rods and the wall. But that has nothing to do with the curtains. I bought a few a first to test the quality, and then ordered more for the remaining windows in my home.
0,This is a very comfortable mattress, even with it's 6" thickness. It was purchased for my son's bunk bed but I laid on it to see if it was comfy, and I put him to bed most night which means climbing Mt. Bunkest and hanging out for a little bit while we do songs or stories, etc..		It's just soft enough to make sleeping restful but not so soft you get lost in it and lose your form thereby causing pain on waking. The bottom of the zipped mattress cover has nodules to keep it from slipping (I included a pic with that detail).		The item was packaged, vacuum sealed, and then sealed again in heavy plastic spiral to make it easier to ship. I'd strongly recommend letting it air out outside or for several days inside if you have the room before letting anyone, especially a kiddo, sleep on this.
0,Love the houndstooth look. Carrier works well, but, if your dish has handles,  the fit may be snug. Otherwise,  very pleased with this purchase.
0,Did not have to go shopping for this.
0,Works as a great honing wand. Used to have a standard metal wand but it was biting my japanese blades and getting micro serrations.		This is great and keeps my blades aligned and sharp, so I don't have to sharpen as often. Should have purchased one earlier.
0,Great in the kitchen, keeps lettuce & greens fresh a bit longer.
0,Perfect serving tray. Great price
0,Nice shower curtain that met our needs
0,It's durable and I use it every day for dirty clothes. I'll be using this for years.  I love it!
0,We used to just plop down our cooking spoons and such on the counter, which inevitably leads to a bit of a mess. Ordered this from Amazon, got it quick, and it is awesome. This is a top quality item, very well made, and is good size too; you can fit a few things on it at once.
0,Clear digital display and easy to use. A handy kitchen tool for sure!
0,Very nice, but now that I've had some experience with it, I find I prefer the more flexible cutting boards. No fault of the board, just understand that it is a rigid cutting board, not a flexible one.
0,This is my second MaxExtract Dual V cleaner and only had to replace the first one because I left it out in freezing weather and broke it.  Had it 10 years and it's gone through four, big dogs, puppies to geriatric.  Just got the replacement and it's just as good as the old one.  Does a better job than hiring a professional and I can hit the high-traffic areas whenever it needs it.  I fill it with the hottest tap water but this model heats it even more and does a great job of extracting.  Easy to clean and has one of the largest set of water tanks of any model.  I don't fill the soap tank but prefer to spot treat stains using a spray bottle, then let the hoover rinse it all out.  After I have cleaned an area, I go over it a couple times without any spray to pull out the water so the carpet dries quickly.  Make sure you vacuum first or you won't have as good a result but you will have a big mess to clean out of the carpet cleaner.  Pull the trigger to spray the water on the forward pass, then let go of the trigger and pull back slowly and see all that junk getting sucked out of your carpet!!!!!!
0,Very nice and happy I purchased this!
0,works great.
0,very good
0,Very handy little chopper.  I bought this one to replace one that had served me well for at least 20 years.
0,Great curtains and block out the sun and heat very well, great for my Phoenix weather
0,Really like this clock
0,Ok.. I haven't tried ALL the towels out there but for this price, you can't get anything better.  It's soft, absorbs fast, and so thick you'll never go back to your old towel.  This stuff is amazing..
0,Solid shot glass. Literally exactly what i thought I would get maybe alittle better. Anyone who complains just remember how cheap these things are. Solid buy. If you want the finest of fine metal shot glasses don't buy ones that go 6 for $10
0,This table matches our kitchen set and they all look great together.  We get a lot of compliments on the slate top.  The price was definitely worth the quality--and it was easy to put together.
0,I love the look of this toaster and the fact that it's long and narrow with the controls on the end.  Oh, and did I mention that it makes great toast, too!!??
0,These are a must have in the kitchen. They have a wonderful feel in the hand and are sturdier than the normal spatula. The fact that they are all one piece instead of ones where the heads slide off make them more sanitary as well. No more worrying about bacteria under the head of the spatula. I plan on ordering a couple mor5e sets and throwing out all the other spatulas in the house.
0,Best knife set love the options and the blade quality
0,Good product
0,I bought 5 of these chairs for my classroom. I love the vibrant colors. They are study and look great. Only complaint I have is that the screws come out at times. They screw back in, but I've already had 2 screws I found on my classroom floor. Ugh!
0,This thing is loud and it will shake you awake. Be prepared for your neighbors to complain. LOL
0,Great French Press - solid and well built, dishwasher safe. My one comment would be to add unit measurements on the side.
0,Nice, large dish drying mat!  It dries quickly and looks clean under my bamboo dish rack.  Stores easily.  I would buy again.
0,Nice and Tall
0,THIS IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND I AM SURE I WILL GET MANY YEARS USE OUT OF IT, AND ENJOY ALL THE FOOD THAT I CAN COOK AND BAKE WITH IT.
0,I have a few sizes of these. The large one I have in my closet to trap any strange odors, and two small ones in my daughters dance bag. I think they do help
0,Let's be honest-how excited can you get over little rubber vacuum cleaner belts?  These are fine quality and do what they are supposed to. Three pack should last you a long time.  No worries-if you need some just order some.
0,Would like to have had an answer sheet.
0,This purchase was a birthday gift for my husband.  He loves it! It keeps him cool and protects from sun exposure. Great hat!
0,A little hard at times, but still gets the job done
0,Matches my white, black, grey and chrome themed bathroom perfectly. Easy to hang and well constructed.
0,great!
0,Fits perfect and works fabulous in our Rainbow vacuum!
0,This spatula is just as the seller described. I love the fact that it handles heat up to 600 degrees. It is very sturdy and very well constructed. The handle is just the right height, not too long, not to short. I would definitely recommend this spatula to anyone looking for the perfect spatula. I'm very satisfied with this purchase
0,Beautiful and elgent
0,Great
0,Totally worth the price.  Soft, absorbent and machine washable.
0,Good perfect weight Beer glasses.
0,This steam cleaner is awesome! Lightweight, easy to maneuver, easy to fill and empty and the nozzle cleaner is genius. Gets all the stuff stuck out quick and easy. Works great too. Cleaned a whole room 14x18 in about 25 minutes including emptying the dirty water and refilling the clean water. I always use tide and Fabuloso for a perfect clean and deodorizer at the same time. Never fails. I don't waste my money on carpet cleaner. Costs too much. You can't go wrong and the warehouse deal was awesome. Not a scratch on it. All I didn't get were the 2 little sample bottles that were obviously used by who ever returned it. Great buy!
0,Wife loves it. Keeps lettuce fresh longer.
0,we gift these to everyone as they are essential grilling product. we use for loose vegetables and nothing falls through. easy to clean. healthy addition to our cooking.
0,Purchased as gift. Blanket appears soft & colorful. Arrived in timely manner.
0,This is a great little heater
0,I like this air purifier but, to me, it is VERY loud...even on the lowest setting.  I purchased it to purify the air and to be used as white noise for sleeping.  I have to put it in the living room in order to sleep.  Also, the light around the dial is bright.
0,Love this set!
0,This set is even prettier in person. A very nice set for a great price.
0,I have a weak hand from my arthritis and sometimes it is very hard to remove caps from bottle or other items.  This does the trick in no time fast!  Glad this little gadget is around to help when I need it most!
0,Last one broke after I dropped I, but it lasted a year with almost daily use. And it's much less expensive than the "recommended" ones. Note: it's accurate but definitely not instant read. You need several seconds to get an accurate reading. I also really like the magnet to keep it on the fridge.
0,Ignore the bad reviews....those people seem to be...stupid. One of the reviewers gave it 1 star because of problems with UPS. Amazon and the manufacturer of this product have nothing to do with UPS. If UPS screws up....why would you give a product 1 star? Another reviewer said it wasn't good for 42" and above. Really? Because I've been using a 60" on it for over 6 months and I love it. Another reviewer complained that it collected dust. Really? Is there a household product that doesn't collect dust? Anyway, this is a great product! Best of all, I have Amazon prime so I had it shipped to me next-day air for only 3.99. Go Amazon.		UPDATE: When I originally purchased this about three years ago I was worried about the quality and how well it would stand up. Still great after three years. My 60" is still hanging fine from it.
0,I love this clock. The price is fantastic.
0,Great little chair, nicely made and looks good as a piece of furniture.
0,Well made aluminum pans.  Nice depth.  We use them for a variety of roasting and baking purposes.  Better price than we can find locally.
0,Just received my frames and they are awesome.  I ordered one to display by Master's degree which I recently received, and ordered one for my bachelor's degree as well so they would be in matching frames.  The frames look so good and display the degrees so well, I am gonna dig out my associates degree from years ago and order a frame for that one too!  A+++!!!  Thanks Art to Frames!!!
0,Perfect set for my four kids
0,The beat small fan. I got this for camping for my sons naps. Worked like magic! Small hit powerful. Never had to replace the batteries. My son napped for 2 hrs x three days so 6 hrs of continuous use and still has power. Highly recommend.
0,I don't like cool mist humidifiers. I just don't feel like they do quite as good a job as warm mist.	This one works really well. I really like being able to just lift off the tank to refill it, and the ability to choose the mist level is nice. On the high setting, a tank will last about eight hours. On the low, about twelve or fourteen.	I took one star off because it's kind of complicated to get apart to clean it, but all in all I'm very happy with it.
0,Smells sooooooo great!
0,Nice little lights...great for wedding...
0,The best blender ever. Perfect for Jamba Juice style smoothies. We use it a lot and it functions very well. Also makes great hummus!
0,These ornaments were awesome. The package came to my home re-taped but all the ornaments were intact. They look great on the tree
0,Good sturdy product designed well holds tight to the wall
0,thin but tuff I dropped on hard floor didn't break
0,I use this just about every day.  I wore the original out on concrete floors and bought this one.  Better than the original because of the wheels on the bottom.  Easy to push in both directions and nice long bristles.  Had it about a year and it has proven to be a great value.
0,A KITCHENS BEST FRIEND. MANY HAPPY FACES.
0,what i needed!
0,Pretty good. Nice.
0,This was a gift for my granddaughter. She was very happy with it. Exactly what she wanted.  We were very pleased with the purchase..
0,The best thing I bought in 2013 by far. Great out of box and the many eggs, bacon, grilled cheese, steaks, burgers, vegetables, pancakes that have been cooked on it would agree. Even cooking and what a great price,Wow!
0,very good attachment, I love it, and it does a good job of mixing everthing in the bowl.
0,Just what i was looking for,  i recommend this product and they are cheaper if you buy 20, good deal, good quality.
0,great buy
0,Extended my sealer so now I don't need to purchase another one yet.
0,Perfect white elephant gift
0,Great for my purpose! Exactly as described.
0,Nice glass for wine. colorful
0,It is BEAUTIFUL and lays just perfectly around my tree!  First really gorgeous tree skirt I have had in all my 83 years!
0,Very nice stools and easy to assemble. They look great and are reasonably priced.
0,Nice
0,Perfect for a log home or man cave oy problem I had was the glass is super duper thin
0,Arrived unblemished, very pretty and a nice match with the RV interior. We'll see how they hold up. Will update this post if they don't hold up well.
0,I like these but some of the red came off onto my pan in some of the cups. Why it didn't do it to all of them, I don't know. I am not that worried, but I could do without that issue.
0,Not as good as the original.  I reverted back to my old one. Much thinner and consistent slices.
0,Cute
0,Gave to my mother for her birthday...she seems to like it.
0,These blackout curtains really do block out all the light. I've purchased other curtains that claimed to do the same thing, but they only slightly lessened the brightness. In the middle of the afternoon on a sunny day, I can shut the curtains and the room goes dark as if it were night. There is a slight light leakage from the bottom and the side of the curtain where it isn't flush with the wall, but it is minimal and doesn't make much difference.		The package comes with two panels, unlike many curtains that you have to buy each panel separately. They feel like satin to the touch and are very soft. I have not washed these curtains yet, but I followed the directions to get the wrinkles out by putting them in the dryer with a wet rag. I took them out right away when they were done and all the wrinkles were gone!		The curtains are able to hang two ways. They have a slot at the top to hang a rod, or they have tabs at the back.		If you work shifts or want to be able to sleep in a dark room but there's light pollution around you, these are the curtains to go with!
0,Exactly what we wanted. Just like the beer glasses you get at most bars or restaurants. Heavy, good quality.
0,Keeps lettuce fresh forever.  Easy to clean.  I love it.
0,As described
0,I bought these to put on top of cake pops.  Can't wait to use them. They are so cute and just the right size. I didn't know that they made molds so small. Love them.
0,Love it
0,These work perfectly, as advertised. No problems. We love them, for zesting and peeling citrus fruits. They let us peel long or short strips, depending on how long we hold them against the skins of the citrus fruits.		Also, we've found that they make great shredders, for root vegetable and destringers, for celery.
0,I love this. It is cute on my kitchen counter.
0,These cups and saucers are perfect. Sturdy, and really beautiful. Love them!!!
0,I really like this piece! My husband put it together relatively easily, and it looks better then expected for being assembled furniture. Suitable size for the moderate dvd collector( buy movies you like frequently, but not necessarily an actual collector). 2 together would probably still look ok, if you don't mind a wall of DVDs/ blu rays. Works great for our families needs.
0,A daughter likes wine, have wine parties and such and this seemed to be something she would like.		It is attractive and well produced.		The shipping went right to her house along with other items for Christmas with no problems.  Good packing and delivery.
0,Stepfather loved it and was so pleased that I was able to find the one that he hadn't gotten last year - score!
0,Excellent product at an excellent price
0,Just right for use, and just right to look at.
0,Very nice,wash and dry well ,excellent price
0,tremendous! I used it for hotpot, and it is excellent!
0,Love this blanket
0,Really cute but kind of brittle plastic - not sure it will hold up for long-term use.
0,These are much more expensive at target than on here. I use this in the air filter in the laundry room by the cat box and it really helps.
0,THAT'S TELLING HIM.
0,The sheets are soft and smooth but not to slippery. I would purchase again.
0,Very soft, very nice!
0,Love this peel.  Finally no hassle getting pizzas in and out of the pizza oven.
0,I cant speak on or compare this to other Turkish Towels because this is the first one I have ever owned but to me it is a great towel. Some reviews said they was disappointed because of shrinkage issues, mine did have a little shrinkage but honestly it don't matter because it's such a huge towel. The packaging was great, no weird smells, great stitching. It's perfect. I couldn't be happier, thanks for a great product!!!
0,Worked and fit as advertised.  A solid "key" and I don't foresee any problems going forward.  I would recommend for the price.
0,As many others have written, this candle is one of the best in looking and "acting" real.  The timer is the deal	maker, too; we have it set for 4 hours so it's on when we get up. Fun and pretty!
0,These work well when used properly with a table cloth and table skirt.
0,Both the design and the recipe on the bottom inspire thoughts of a summer afternoon on the deck. Nice quality plastic ware. These glasses were for me, but I have given two other sets as birthday presents. I think I will buy the stemless wine glasses next!
0,Keeps water and ice cold for an incredible amount of time. I LOVE the wide mouth, especially for putting in ice. I also love the carry lid, which is so easy to get on and off and has a great seal - has not spilled once.
0,PERFECT!!...Been looking to replace an old 4-tine mixing fork for years.	Sturdy...will not be bending & great for serving also...Beautiful forks!  Thank You!!
0,Perfect for what I needed it for -- it took me about an hour (in between watching tv) to put it together by myself --  it keeps my dvd's organized and looking nice behind that glass.  Minor things that bother me -- when you slide one door over it actually goes completely behind the other one so you have to move the other door to slide it back...no way of getting your hand on it until you slide the stationary door.  I do not have it "locked" to the wall -- though it does rock a bit - I am aware and am careful when opening and closing the doors. I would consider getting another if I run out of room.
0,Beautiful. It is more grayish but oh my it is worth the money and more. Lovely shape, easy installation, looks fabulous and great price. Very very happy
0,I love this
0,I loved these votives I bought for thank you gifts for my sons wedding.  However two of them were broken.  I didn't want to return the entire box of 12, so I just let it go.
0,There was a bit of a learning curve to find the right depth to hang the cups.  You don't want it so high that it doesn't cook properly, but you don't want it laying on the bottom, either.  Once I figured it out I had some of the best poached eggs ever.  I never liked the taste of vinegar in my eggs and I found I don't really need to use it with these cups.  They are bigger than I thought they would be so you need a fairly wide (not deep) pan to use them.  Nice draining feature on them so no more watery eggs.
0,This set of cookware is actually being used to replace a much more expensive set of cookware that it has thoroughly surpassed.  With the even cooking surface, heat is distributed correctly and your food will be cooked evenly each time.  The pots take to heat well, and get very hot quickly if you need them to.  The handles remain cool, so taking the pots off the stove is very easy and comfortable.  If you need to throw the pans in the oven to finish food off, they are also quite good at that.
0,this clock is great & very clear to ready I've been looking for a clock like this for a long time but most 24 hour clock are either digital or they're analog but only 10" (the 14" is hard to find!) but this clock is nice with a quiet second hand that's the best part)
0,I originally bought these drapes because my sister got them for her daughters room and raved about them. So I bought a set for my bedroom and they are just as wonderful as she stated. I  have purchased these drapes twice now as they are also in my son's room, who is due to arrive in January. They are WONDERFUL for blocking out all the light. the only part that peaks in is at the top of the window where the drapes don't hit. But in the middle of the day, my room is pitch black just the way i like it. They are a really good price for what you get. Quality made for sure. Material is a soft satin that really make the room look that much nicer. I will definitely purchase these again in the future!
0,Now me being a person that has bought a lot of (El Cheapo) Blenders have went through so many blenders that it is crazy. But this blender I think is going to be around for a while which I have been looking for a while in this price range. They say it is reconditioned, well I must say one thing it show's no proof of any where or used condition because everything looks new & I really think the pitcher is new. Now take in mine that this is my first day with it so I have some more trying out to do, but this thing so far has been wonderful. One thing is it comes with a wrench to tighten the bottom of pitcher on & I did & good thing I did because it was really loose, so I did & I just had a little leakage at the bottom of the pitcher, so then I tightened it more & then more & now it is fine & hoping it stays that way. Also it chops ice with ease & I am amazed with the texture & taste of my green smoothie, simply something I have not had before & very good might I add. Oh & beware this thing is so powerful I had to hold the lid on because it loosens a little & will try to rise the lid off a little bit. The cleaning was Very Very EASY & I mean it. I could not believe how easy it was to wash out. All I did to clean it was to rinse,wash pitcher in sink, then I rinsed, then I dried out with paper towel. You can also just squirt a a little tiny dab of liquid dish detergent in the pitcher a long with under a half pitcher of water & turn it on & it can be cleaned like that, but watch it because this blender is very powerful, so if you are not careful while cleaning it by blending the soap in it, it could pop the lid off like I did (Very Funny) & give your kitchen a little wash( Funny ( but it did happen when I tried it, so I said to my self that I will just wash my pitcher in the sink, so I re washed it & it could not be any easier. Don't do what I did as lame as I was & funny & embarrassing. Oh & this blender was way quieter then any blender that I have ever used. Also the Lid has sort of a rubber layered suction top because it is well built with this strong rubber around the lid & the lid even has a special little finger hoop loop thingy that is great to have to take off lid easily. This company clearly paid attention to detail by adding a finger loop for finger on lid & they even put a finger loop around the plug-in cord which is made of a very hard & seemingly durable plastic, so it will be a breeze to take out of your electrical outlet. Also the base of the blender is heavy & made with real stainless Steele & not of that fake Stainless Steele look that other blenders use which only looks like the real thing where as this is the real thing, & well made you can tell by looking at it, touching it & picking it up & or using it. The pitcher is made very well also & is very heavy & is made with very thick durable glass. To me this blender is a steal at this price because it was reconditioned, but well worth every little penny that I spent on it & I know this is only the first day, but believe me, me & this Blender will be making a lot of smoothies together(Smile-He He). Go buy one because at this price there is no way you could beat the exceptional quality & excellence that this product is going to give you because I for one am going to love it & use it everyday. I hope my running at the mouth/keyboard helped you (Wink-Smile).
0,nice sheets and the color is great
0,I liked the curtain. Its not a true purple but matched well with my magenta decor. If you want a thick covering be sure you double it. I added magenta paper streamers to give it a fuller look. Overall, I was very pleased with the product, just be aware of the color.
0,Great, Like the wall mounted Idea
0,I was told to use this in addition to my gluclosomine
0,These pillows are comfy and firm for the most part which is why I like them.
0,I'm surprised by the other reviews about how flimsy and bulky this unit is and that it doesn't work - not even on a zucchini.  I do not share the same experiences.  I finally pulled this out now that the Christmas holiday is over and I am looking for more healthy ways to eat and I found this unit to be nice and compact and easy to use.  I made zucchini spaghetti and had no trouble with either the blade cutting the zucchini or the suction.  And I did do a lot of pushing so the suction held very well for me.  For the price I find this to be a great spiralizer.  They even include replacement parts in a nice bag should you need them.  While I have only used the spaghetti blade, I'm sure the others work the same.  I had fun spiralizing and can't wait to create my next spiralized meal.  Based on my experience, I do recommend this product.  Maybe there was a bad batch of these or something - but my experience has only been positive.		I wish I would have taken a picture so you could see the results.  If I think of it I will do it the next time I pull this out and will post.  Healthy eating everyone!
0,Very sturdy, light weight. We've had multiple coats on it and a few hats and it held them with no problem. May buy another one for my downstairs
0,Purchased to donate to local fire department for use with raptor and small animal rescue. Will be easy to wash, and can be disposed of if necessary - cost was not so bad that it's a loss if they get damaged.
0,Just as I thought and as the other reviews say.  The threading is 3/4" thick and it's a heavy duty faucet.
0,Fantastic quality! My daughter absolutely loves this set! Bought for a christmas present and she doesn't want it taken off her bed... even to wash (but we do it anyway, :) )
0,These jars are excellent for kitchen pantry storage. They are easy enough to hold with one hand, but also hold a reasonable amount of food (pasta, rice, beans, etc.). They look beautiful in a simple line, whether on an exposed shelf or in a cabinet. The lids are larger than those for smaller Ball jars, though, so if lids are hard to come by near you it would be best to order some extras to have them on hand.
0,Very nice
0,Excellent value and performance.  Does all that can be expected from a toaster at a reasonable price.  Why pay more?
0,love my new dish rack. easy to assembly
0,It just works
0,Awesome deal with quality parchment
0,Very practical and very good for the price.
0,Very comfy chair and perfect for someone my size (I'm 5'3", 110lbs). I can actually have my feet on the ground and my back is supported nicely.  Only complaint (as I've seen others write about) is upon arrival, the chair fabric is scuffed a bit on the corners where the bottom meets the back. For me, it's not a huge deal as I don't notice it, but it is something to be aware of and hopefully the company will package it better for shipping.
0,This might or might not be usable as a state regulated scale for commerce but it is VERY NICE scale none-the-less.  The instructions lack a little and the bubble level isn't good but anyone can either use it without leveling of put a level on the top of it.		It is accurate, has more features than I need but certainly there is never too many features to play with for me.  It measures in lbs and kgs and decimals thereof.  If you need ounces you can use M1 set to 16.00 and just hit it and the amount (dollars) will display ounces.  By the way, the instructions don't say how to do this but the way I do it is hit what I want to save as a price... (16.00) then save button then the memory location to put it in (M1, etc).  To use it just hit the memory location (M1, etc) and it will display in the price display.  Total will display lbs * price.  Pretty cool... how do they make this for $50.00?		Anyway, yes, it is somewhat cheap looking if you are looking for a $400.00+ scale like at Restaurant Depot but it is VERY serviceable and I LOVE it!		  RJ
0,So far so good. Item arrived quickly and was not at all damaged in shipping a few days ago. Quickly wiped it down and turned in on. Do not like that once you plug it in it automatically starts heating up, so just be aware. I cooked for marinated boneless chicken breasts (4 of them) in about 5 minutes and they were plump and juicy. Clean up was a breeze popping off each side of the grilliing mechanism and wiping them down. Recommend!
0,Super like the color!! Im so happy that I chose the orange one!!		It is quiet while heating and it doesnt take long to boil a whole kettle of water.
0,this dragon steals your heart.  just a real cutie.	the detail is perfect, and the eyes are magic.	maybe alittle smaller than I would like but still	I bought this one for me;  not another gift.	I love him !
0,works ok coating is thin already scratched.
0,Great storage for your Kcups!
0,The price is very good for TWO filers.  I received the two filter plastic bag the same day as my new red Scorpion.  I am not giving this product five stars because there were no instructions as how to clean it.  I had noticed when viewing other filters for the Scoprion that it said the filter was washable. What does washable mean?  Under the faucet, washing machine, etc.  I had to go to another Dirt Devil, dust cup filter, site on Amazon to read it was washable plus was able to read a review that a lady put it in her washing machine.  I do have allergies this time of the year and using a damp paper towel, as another lady recommended,  to clean would defeat the purpose, since the motion created by rubbing with a paper towel would send dust into my nose.		I wonder how this would clean in a dishwasher?  I could put it in my GE inside the silverware bin that has a flap cover for some light items not to bounce around.  I will review later if the filter comes out all right from a dishwasher.
0,This is a very nice lighting set that worked nicely on our pre lit all white light tree. Will be getting another for next Christmas as 30 feet was not quite enough.
0,Perfect parchment mini baking cups. No cooking spray needed. Hold up beautifully. Easy to peel off. Unlike other brands which must have cooking spray. Highly recommend.  Would like to see different liner colors/patterns (if the chocolate color won't bleed thru).
0,Great product, Love the food! Digital timer count down. Not a clock.	It says not to cook with locks in place, they are for travel only.	The lid has a high temp rubber gasket so the condensation does not bubble out.	A small hole(1/4") in glass half way down from handle lets the pressure out.	Move up in the cooking world!
0,decent quality
0,Great chairs so far.  Sturdy and look good.  Considering buying 2 more...
0,It is what it is...and that's an inexpensive storage cabinet. It looks like the pic. but just like all inexpensive laminate assemble at home products it looks like what I expected. I like it because it is not excessively deep, good storage for our office. It probably won't hold up under heavy use. But if you are looking for inexpensive, sturdy storage that will be used infrequently than this is your solution. Instructions are in pictures. Went together easily. Deeded two people to attach the doors. The doors had a small gap at center until I adjusted the adjustable hinges. How to is in the instructions. You'll be fine as long as you follow the instructions.
0,I bought this to hold a photo canvas I had made for a friend and it worked perfectly.
0,nice and bright!
0,looks very nice and it's durable
0,I downsized this year and moved into a smaller home.  Our empty nest can become cramped if we don't watch what we purchase.  I wanted to see how compact this vegetable steamer is because I do  have limited space now.  I though it would easy to live on a smaller scale but although out home is smaller, our products have stayed the same size.  I was and still am really impressed with this veggie steamer and I use it at least several times a week.  Our favorite veggies in the steamer is baked potatoes, carrots, green beans, frozen corn and just about any kind of vegetable imaginable.  It's easy to clean and compact for storing.
0,Great deal for my foodsaver. Ive saved so much money on food since I got the foodsaver!
0,What can one say about Rubbermaid?	Not exciting, simple, staid	They stack up nicely when arrayed	Edges even, nothing frayed	From the air, they form a blockade	These replace old ones mislaid	And for this review, nothing was paid
0,A bit over priced for what it is but I couldn't find one cheaper. It looks nice and does the job!
0,I ordered 2 sets since I love my spices. Not a lot of room in a 1 bedroom apartment & since I like to have my spices where I can see them these racks were perfect for me. They're even big enough to store larger than average size bottles as you should be able to tell from the picture.
0,Makes packing sauerkraut quicker and much easier. Much more comfortable to hold than those with thin handles.
0,works well
0,I had been using a Rabbit opener for years. It did the job quickly and easily.  I really had no complaint other than occasionally losing control of the bottle when the required lateral force is applied. Sometimes the bottom of the bottle would slip on smooth surfaces and I was in danger of spilling wine or dropping the bottle entirely.		Not with this thing! Just put it on top of the cork, push the button, and watch the cork come straight out. It takes more time than the Rabbit, but it's more entertaining to watch and actually takes up less space on the countertop. I like that the charger can be put away instead of having a stand that clutters my work surface.		The foil cutter that attaches to the top works well, though it does appear a little flimsy. Time will tell.		The pourer that comes with it will never be used.
0,Fits perfect and looks great.
0,Good for stall shower
0,Did not expect it to fit perfectly. My chair is not very big. But I  put some styroform slabs from packing boxes down the sides of the cushion seat and it is fine. Good neutral  color. I'll buy the ottoman slipcover when you get it.
0,Okay, I admit I am an "OXO-groupie". I love their well-made products and I even visit the OXO Tower on the south bank of the Thames when I'm in London. They have great design shops and a cool restaurant at the top. Why is this important? It isn't, but it may cement my claim to being a huge fan of OXO products.		This product - the OXO Good Grips Convertible Plastic Colander - is as good as every other OXO product I've bought and used. The "legs" extend over my sink perfectly (now, I have one of those sinks that have a small basin on one side and a larger on the other. I don't know how well it will work on sinks that have two equal size basins.) If you don't want to extend the legs, they are in a well folded position. The holes drain efficiently and the bowl can be used to drain hot water, as well as cold water without warping the plastic. There's not much you can say about a plastic colander - books are a lot easier to write a review about - but OXO makes good products. They're not too expensive. I think you can count on this colander to do what it's supposed to do and add a bit of chic to your kitchen.
0,I have bought a few sets of these Majestic Brushes. I try to buy when the price dips a bit. They are very well constructed for the price. And they are versatile. I am a beginner, so cannot yet justify investing in more than just a few quality brushes--until I develop skill and good brush hygiene.  All of these majestic sets seem highly reviewed.  I need to learn WHAT sizes and TYPES I most use for each media. So, these Majestics, and also the Aqualons and Supremes from the same company offer lots of sizes and types, for media across the board. A good way to gain experience, without breaking the bank.  I have bought a few Escoda, DaVinci and Silver brushes, so I can experience what a really good brush feels like.  I also like the Princeton Value pack with the orange handle.
0,This is a fun ornament. Different from your typical Christmas themed ornaments, this little random ornament is worth a chuckle.
0,I took one star off because the set I received included a glass bowel with the metal tab intended to connect with the mixer lift was reversed.  Instead of facing down, it was installed facing upward.  Rather than attempt to take it apart with which to fix the problem and risk damaging it, I elected to send it back.  It looked to be a manufacturing defect, not a consistent issue as a result of poor product design.  I haven't reordered yet, however I'm certain I will.  It seems to be of reasonably good quality otherwise.  I already own some of the other specialty beaters designed for this particular (glass) bowl, so it's only a matter of time before I add it to my collection of KitchenAid mixer accessories.
0,This table was easy to put together and looks absolutely amazing in our entry way! I would recommend this table to a friend.
0,Used this film for my little bathroom window. I was hesitant that it would come off after all the steam from the hot showers, but the film is still intact after a few weeks. I like that it allows some privacy, but still lets the natural light in.
0,I bought this bread maker because I was told to try gluten free bread.	I have never baked bread before	I don't use the oven	I don't even cook.	But I am using this bread maker!	I am actually surprised because I don't use the other appliances very much.	But, I am using this bread maker!!!
0,The wife enjoys her wine and she has hung this sign up on the refrigerator door.  It get a good laugh from all who see it hanging there.
0,Time saver
0,This works just like in the commercial! First travel mug that is TRULY spill proof. So much so, thinking about getting one for my 11 yr old to use in my very light beige car interior ;-)
0,LOVE these! I was skeptical about whether they would actually be helpful or if they only seemed like a good idea, but after 2 months, my drawers are still organized.  Size are just right for my drawers.
0,I love it
0,makes a very impressive gift!
0,Bought this for my grandparents surprise 50th anniversary because the color scheme was gold and black...it's very sturdy and a nice size at a great price
0,Works great and the price was phenomenal.  I use mine for occasional small weight measurements and it has proved reliable and very accurate.  Seller was great and delivery on time.
0,Love it,keeps you cozy in the winters.
0,Love this thing, it is not too small/large and does a great job measuring.  I love all things OXO!!
0,very heavy glass, just like anchor hocking glass old school. Nice product
0,Wish it snapped like the pink  one does.. But nice  that's why I only gave  it a 4
0,This is the best one I have purchased. So many attachments and it is so quiet. I love it! I am so glad I bought it.
0,I love this vacuum and use it every other day. We have the cat litter box in the bathroom and litter gets everywhere. This vacuum is so powerful and picks up the litter from the bathroom floor, carpet outside the bathroom, and all the other surfaces the litter gets into. I love the small nozzle size that allows the vacuum to get into those tight spaces.		I occasionally use this for vacuuming my furniture and it does very well with the removable pink head.		Emptying the vacuum is great and cleaning the filters are super simple. The power cord is very long so it's perfect for a lot of uses.
0,Seems like it will work very well... fits the tray well, lies nice and flat, wipes off easily
0,Works great! Very sharp blades slice right through the apples!
0,Very impressed! I used to use a solid metal apple peeler I paid twice as much for at Williams Sonoma but that was always very hard to use and took as much apple as it did peel. I decided to replace it after it stopped working after a year. When this arrived, I took it out of the box and though ... what have I done?! ... because it felt so flimsy and cheap, like a toy.		I'm pleased to report just a few cranks and it removes only the skin on the apple in a matter of seconds. Much, much better than the metal version! It's so easy and it barely takes any of the apple off. The downside is that it does leave a considerable amount of peel on the top and bottom of the apple and no amount of tweaking the angles, etc. seems to help with this. Not a huge deal as I just core the apple and cut the ends with the skin off but it is kind of a waste.		The suction cups on the bottom are useless on my marble countertops and glass cutting board. I just hold the unit down while I'm cranking it. Not a big deal but it takes some getting used to as does positioning the arm near the apple.		This really should cost $5-$10 given how cheap it feels. I'm guessing that it won't last more than a year or so with light use. They do give you an extra blade but I can see the blade dulling quick and once the second one dulls, I have a feeling the whole unit will have to be replaced, with is fine but that's an awful lot of plastic going into a landfill which could be kept by offering blade replacements.		Will this last a while? Doubtful. Is it perfect? No. But it saves so much time and effort when peeling apples and imo is better than the more expensive and more prone to stop working metal version.
0,I like this a lot, it's very sleek and fits in with the contemporary design in my household. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking to clean things up and save space in your living area.
0,Perfect. Wish they had more colors.
0,I bought this for my office.  It definitely does what I needed it to do.  I assembled it as shown in the photo and the lower and middle shelves have ample room to hold folders, books and magazines with room to spare.  Nice, solid construction and easy to assemble.  I like that it folds up too.  If you ever have to stow it away, it wouldn't take up much room.
0,I was skeptical, but I cooked salmon in the Lekue with a small amount of olive oil, salt, and pepper, and it took only a few minutes and actually tasted really good. Clean up is awesome. The cookbook is pretty disappointing and I can see why it's given away for free.
0,What can I say about this product?  Well, it is a great cutting board, large enough for many jobs in the kitchen and also has a grove on one side to prevent juices for meat to go to the countertop.  The metal handle is very convenient and it is easy to clean and maintain.
0,Very nice peeler!!
0,Very good
0,Great customer response to questions...my first try with tomatoes and bell peppers left much to be desired.  They responded immediately advising to use the slicer blade only for these two vegetables.  Was overwhelmed at how much spaghetti one zucchini produced. When	combined with all the other veggies I tried, there was enough to feed the neighbors as well.  Raw beets were our biggest surprise...they're delicious, and so was the rutabaga and turnips. Thanks for a wonderful, well made product.
0,NICE AND DURABLE GRIP
0,Work as advertised, however, I'm not sure it's really worth having to "blow" them out.  It's almost less convenient than simply having an on/off switch.  However, the 5 year old loves to do it.  They were smaller than I expected.		Update: Ohuhu reached out to me unsolicited and refunded my money.  Thank you.  Changing from 3 out of 5 to a 4 because of this.
0,Good price
0,Bought it to have kids decorate it with sharpies. I just put a piece of flat cardboard inside the bag, laid it flat, and let the kids go to town on it. The bag has held up since November with daily use. The sharpie designs still look great! Quite a large bag!
0,I was impressed with not only the looks of this unit, but the ease with which I could get a nice sharp edge on some good knives that hadn't been sharpened for awhile.  Very easy to use, has rubber on base so it doesn't move around when you are using it, and fits nicely in a drawer because it is a compact design.  Pretty enough to leave out if you want to.
0,Very nice, love the remote to change colors
0,Had a few dents but essentially it's perfect for the purpose. I ordered this to put on the wall of my kid's room for a magnet board. This size is perfect for two kids to use at the same time. I was able to hang with velcro command strips (about 10 sets).
0,Great product. My husband has had back surgeries and our other one fell apart.
0,Love it
0,This is so cute
0,Nice clock
0,This shoe rack needed an assembly, but the assembly was not too complicated.  After the assembly, it serves me without problems. But don't sit on it!
0,Well made, easy to assemble, and do the job they were designed to do.  The open shelves allow air to circulate and they look like they will hold up with all the use I will give them.
0,This is a very nice bread knife. Inexpensive compared to the equivalent steel knife. It cannot be stored on a magnetic strip. Great customer service by the manufacturer.
0,I love this pot. I use it for brewing beer. It is sturdy and well built. I have no complaints.
0,Very sturdy, holds a lot. Makes all your canned goods visible. No more losing stuff to the back of the cabinet.
0,Good photo frame for 8x10 photos, the back is well secured so the photos do not come loose.
0,High quality product, works well on induction burner.  Cleanup is user friendly and browns meat well for a non stick product.  Will buy addon pieces in the future.
0,Gave as gifts
0,When I first got this pillow I was disappointed and almost returned it. It was very flat. Then I ran across the email I was sent by the seller. The instructions were to either shake the pillow vigorously for about 5 minutes or throw in the dryer for a few minutes. I chose to shake it for about 3 minutes or so (very tiring lol). Then something amazing happened, the pillow fluffed up!  Needless to say, I'm definitely keeping it for my sons room so it's easier to sit up to read to him before bed. I may get three more for each of my girls! Make sure you follow the directions so you will have a nice fluffy euro pillow.  The pillow comes with a cover that's meant to have a pillow case put over it. It's actually really nice and I'm glad I discovered this little treasure because it's really comfortable to lean or lay on!
0,Compact, well made, easy to use, easy to clean and makes great espresso.  I look forward to my 2 cups every morning.
0,Just as described.  Nice set.
0,Exactly what I wanted. Size and everything was perfect
0,awesome
0,love it
0,I love the color and the assortment of tools. I am very happy and wish there were 5 different tools with the same color to go with these.
0,I only own cast iron pans and this one has got to be my favorite.  It's perfect for making pancakes, fried eggs but my favorite thing to use it for is making omelets.  Nothing sticks to it as long as you follow the directions; never use soap on it!
0,Man, you get a ton of these in a pack.  Will keep me stocked for quite a while.
0,AAA+
0,Like this duvet! Nice and soft and roomy for our king comforter. Love the gray and white. Definitely recommend! Thanks!
0,Had I been rating it only for a "right-handed" person like myself, I probably would have given it five stars even though I have a bit of an issue because of a lack of sufficient leverage over the last model that I owned. It's well constructed and has tripped through the dishwasher without any issues. However, since it is described as being for right or left-handed people, you are going to be upset if you are the latter. The handled cone containing the grating rasps can indeed be shifted from the right to the left. But if you shift it to the left to turn with your left hand, the rasps are then facing the wrong way and to operate it you have to turn the handle counter-clockwise (towards you instead of the natural away from you) and this is extremely awkward--I tried it.
0,I like it
0,I use this to make pour-over coffee. I can't say enough good about it. Hit the 200 degree button and I'm good to go.
0,Very pleased!
0,I like this rack very much. It has helped free cabinet space considerably. Hanging pots look cool, "professional", and are quite easy to remove and put back. Only concern (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) are the hooks that, as other have noticed, tend to interfere with the handling of the pots and pans. They are too tight, get stuck on the pot and come off the rack with it. Haven't had a real problem so far, but it only would be a matter of time. As other customers, I ended up buying cuisinart hooks and they work just fine (but there shouldn't be the need for them in the first place). Otherwise the rack is nice, functional, sturdy. It is not, in my opinion, wrought iron though.
0,I used it as soon as it arrived. I bought it because I'm trying to use soy flour to make biscuits, and being an ex-bake the formula for making in bread is weighting the ingredients in stead of using cup and spoon.. With the bowl in place when it is turned on it goes to 0 to start and you don't have to compensate for the weight of the bowl. With the digital numbers showing is better than looking at a graduated scale and guessing if you read it right.	Using this device will make it easier to adjust the ingredients until I get a biscuit that is palatable.
0,This was sent as a gift and the recipient went wild over this.  She couldn't believe she received such an extravagant gift and loves it.	I couldn't believe such an extravagant gift was so inexpensive.	Love this company and plan to use them everytime I need linens.
0,sturdy, happy I made the purchase, bottle "nest" well in this
0,No more batter on the counter or unevenly  cooked waffles.  After some trial I found that after removing the waffle at the beeps.  Close it and wait for the beeps again.  Pour batter in while it's beeping. The layered cake on qvc looks good. Think I'll try it next.
0,This is everything I imagined it was. Fits perfect over my large dinner table. It will be perfect for my girls party! It beautiful and well made. comes in a nice storage bag also.
0,WELL MADE
0,Just the right size and works well.
0,The best sheets I have had so far and reasonably priced as well.
0,This is not nearly as scary as I thought it would be. This is my first pressure cooker so I was a little intimidated and could only imagine it blowing up. The instructions are very clear. It does cook fast but the cooling before you can open it takes much longer than I expected. I simply didn't know that.		It's just my husband and I so the 4qt is perfect. My neighbor has the exact same one that she's had for over 20 years and it's still going strong. She has a family of three and I drop by occasionally for dinner. Again, the size is perfect. I would recommend it.
0,If you have a Kirby, this is the place to go for bags. They are so reasonable and it's nice to vacuum once again!
0,I bought this to cook the waffles for my husband like the ones in the motels he loves so much. I love it. It is very easy to use, easy clean up, and cooks them perfectly.
0,I LOVE THIS BLANKET!!! ITS SO SOFT!!! NO ONE ELSE IS ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT!!! ITS MY PRECIOUS!!!
0,Nice size. Love it. Exactly as pictured!
0,This is a good beginner set. I don't like the spoon though because it's hollow and would probably be a pain to clean, and so I junked it and got a proper solid one instead.
0,Getting harder to find these filters but I love using them with my old percolator as they trap the sediment from the ground coffee.
0,After hours of mashing fruit through a colander with a wooden spoon, and fighting to mill the pulp through fixed-grate mills whose holes were just too small, I borrowed one of these from a friend.  5 gallons of crab apples was taking me 5+ hours the mashing way, and I was able to mill 5 gallons in half an hour with the Oxo mill!  I've done peaches and plums through it as well.  I purchased my own because I never want to mash pulp through a strainer with a spoon EVER AGAIN.  Love it <3		The big blade worked excellent for the crab apples, but some seeds got through, so I did a second mill through the medium sized grate and it made a fine, smooth, creamy butter.
0,family loves the look of them good deal for the price
0,I purchased 4 bath towels, 8 hand towels, and 12 wash clothes for a total of $93.  I had been looking for 700 gram weight towels since I stayed at The Sanctuary Hotel at Kiawah Island, a 5 star resort.  Their towels were nice, but the same number of towels would've cost me $292 + shipping!  I figured I'd order these towels and see how I liked them, and I love them.  We've had them about a month now, and I just ordered a few more of the large bath towels.		I also compared prices with local department stores like Macy's... they were having a 30% of sale and I had a 30% coupon, and their towels would've still cost me $350!!
0,These are wonderful, heavy, and a great size, they stay on the side of the glass.  The plastic picks break and these do not.
0,perfect and to think I almost spent twice as much on a competitor
0,Got this for my daughter who loves Alladin
0,These are so much easier to clean than the original ones.  The top, after unscrewing it, has a pop up so the place where you sip can be more easily cleaned. Love them!  The locking lid also makes sure they don't leak if tipped.  Got rid of the old ones by the same company
0,Bought this to heat the garage in Washington and it works VERY VERY well. We love it a LOT. 2 car garage warm in 15 min
0,super easy to use. a bit cheaply made of plastic, but the price was right
0,good size, well made, like the non slip criss cross pattern inside, will get lots of use from this one
0,Excellent for padachu pastry.
0,great air fryer
0,These are super cute! Not sure how long they will last since they are ceramic like.
0,very sharp knife, you need to learn how to hone the steel if you decide to purchase this set
0,Well made and it looks like I paid twice the amount
0,As every Yankee candle expected. Gorgeous!
0,Excellent product and company to do business with! Thank you!
0,A little bit of fun,
0,great
0,THX
0,These work well and improves the taste of the coffee/tea. This will NOT remove chlorine taste completely on its own, but works well in combination with my inexpensive 3M Filtrete under-sink filtration.
0,I was in search of a product that gave me the best value for the money.  I bought the queen size frame for the guest room in early December 2011.  I'm late in posting my review because I wanted the opinion of a few of my house guests.  They were impressed (as I am), no box spring (no problem), no squeaking (as folding metals beds usually do), and great under bed storage (bed height is the same or higher as a bed on a box frame w/ wheels with minimal storage). I have to concur w/ other 5-star reviews (that's why I bought it), it's a well-made & efficient product!  Even better this product is listed Amazon Prime!  If you're a member, free 2 day shipping!  The item did arrive in 2 days and delivered to my front door (up a long driveway & a flight of stairs). You do the math, where can you find a new queen size box spring and frame as well as front door delivery for this price.  My husband who is "handyman challenged" put it together quickly.  If I decide to change the room back to an office in the future, the frame (2 pieces for queen size) can easily be taken apart, folded and stored in the garage with a minimal space requirement.  One of best purchases I have made on Amazon!
0,I first purchased a De'Longhi EC155, within 3 days of having this machine I knew it was going back, it brewed only a so-so pull of espresso, it just doesn't have the wattage to pump the steam through the grinds.  I did a bit of research and found the Melitta, it cost about $20 more than the De'Longhi but you pay for what you get!		Right out of the box the Melitta has performed flawlessly! It is soooo much quieter than the De'Longhi, has 250 more watts of power - the espresso is excellent!  The frother works great, the nozzle is much longer than on the De'Longhi & it has a small extension off the frother piece that allows you to move the wand without burning your fingers - this machine was well thought out!		It is also heavier and a tad bit larger than the De'Longhi, it seems like a much better quality machine - I am thrilled with it! One thing though is the plastic tamper, it works but I purchased a stainless steel model as the plastic doesn't have the weight to tamp properly.
0,Great in-refrigerator storage for bottles of jams, jellies, ketchup, mustard, etc.  Slides in and out of our very deep refrigerator without any problem.  Allows us to reach the "bottles in the back" with minimal hassle.  A great find.
0,I now own 2 of these Beast tumblers and I am very happy with the purchase.		There are a million and 1 different brands out there, but a lot of them just don't look right to me...in that they are really shiny.		The beast cups remind me of a stainless steel stovetop or a stainless steel fridge.  The lids stay on and are  secure, and the straw is an added bonus.		After ordering my second cup, I noticed a crack in the lid upon unboxing.  I contacted Green Steel and they offered to ship me out a replacement lid no problem.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase
0,This pressing cloth mia thiner and lighter than I thought it would be, but it works well. It remains to be seen as to how long it will last.
0,I really like these decanters. They look great in my white kitchen and are a perfect size. Very happy with them. Exactly what I was looking for.
0,This chair, though smaller than I thought it would be, was perfect.  It was just what I expected.  The only bad things was there was a "new" odor smell that wasn't pleasant.
0,They fit well and look like the OEM filters, no real way to tell if they filter as good as them.
0,This set looks wonderful and I am proud to use it for my guests.  However, I recently picked up a spoon, and I was shocked to see that the description (Wallace 18/10 China) was on the TOP of the handle, not underneath as it should have been.  The Quality Control department missed this mistake!  I don't want to repack the set and ship to back, too much trouble and expense.  But, the faulty spoon marking makes me question Wallace's reputation for quality.
0,Love these. I have several of different sizes that I use to help organize my kitchen cabinets. I even have one in the freezer to hold smaller bags that have been opened and partially used.
0,The perfect small Christmas gift for my little 14 year old who has dreams of becoming a pastry chef!  Will be great for her to use for any occasion!
0,It's just beautiful!  I just have to figure out a way to hold these saddles on to the headstone.  I already lost a very pretty and expensive one.  That doesn't take away from the beauty of this one.  I'm just trying to figure out how I can keep them on the headstone without losing them and all the money I've spent on them.
0,I own this product and love it!  So I bought another as a gift!
0,This is one of those things you don't realize you need until you happen on it shopping for something else!  I was always struggling with my other measuring spoons and spilling spices on my counter. This solved that problem nicely.  So happy I found them!
0,It fit OK.  Was kind of hard to get the back pillows squished into the cover.  It works well for me.  Happy with the product.
0,I am pretty pleased with this little vac!  I was looking to replace my old&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Karcher/dp/B0014XM730/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Karcher</a>&nbsp;that I've had for years and was starting to die.  I paid twice the price for the Karcher than I did for this Eureka model.		There were two major requirements I had for my new cordless vac that I would use in between hauling out the regular vac:	- To pick up dog hair from wood floors and area carpets	- To pick up small pebbles and rocks that are tracked into the house from the yard.  Even though I never wear shoes in the house, those pebbles are always making their way onto my kitchen floors!  I suspect they are brought in by the ones who are responsible for the dog hair  :)		I was pleased when I first tried this vac and discovered that it quickly sucks up both the dog hair and the pebbles without a problem.  There is a spinning brush that can be turned on or off which is a great touch... sometimes the brush is needed for grabbing onto stuff like the dog hair better, but sometimes it's best to turn it off when attacking the pebbles.		Battery life hasn't been an issue for me.  I can do a quick cleanup of about 800 square feet on a single battery... and this model comes with TWO of them so even if I ran out of juice on one, I could just pop in the other one.  The fact that two batteries are included is a great selling point.		If you are looking for a cordless vac to perform some quick cleanups in between regular vacuuming, I highly recommend this product!
0,Ordered this for our guest room.  It is very sturdy and the wood looks attractive.  Folds very easily for storage.  Just perfect for your guests so they don't have to bend over to the suitcase on the floor!  Specially if you have "older" guests, this really saves their backs!
0,Love it
0,They are lighter than what we are used to, but they are surprisingly durable and have stayed sharp for many months now, Great buy and high quality. It also helps that they are nice looking.
0,I LOVE this steamvac! We have a dog and a toddler so our carpet is constantly getting little stains. The first time I used it I couldn't believe how dirty the water was! Yuck!! It's awesome because it has two separate tanks, one for the clean water and soap and the other for the dirty water. If you want clean carpet buy this steamvac!!
0,Beautiful browns, beige colors. Pretty contemporary!! Looks great!
0,The size is perfect for a small space.  The numerals really show up nicely.  The radio to be is very good for such a small clock.
0,LOVE!!
0,Work great  Charge last long time
0,These filters fit in my Neato XV-21 perfectly and seem to do the exact same job as the Neato branded ones but at a fraction of the price.  Neato sells theirs @ $25 for two filters whereas you can get these @ $10 for four.  The math says it all.
0,Love it and works great :) Worth the money
0,Best price on Amazon.  I replace the filter every time the machine asks for replacement.  Works great on my Z5.
0,Smells great and has lasted a long time!
0,Love these.  So cute and perfect size for cooking an egg or two.  Very good quality.
0,These Espresso cups are outstanding, they are the perfect size, not too small, not too large, and the double glass walls keep the Espresso hot and the outside warm.
0,Love it. Easy bromide and clean. Get the gold filter v
0,I use it to make FRENCH MACARON COOKIES. IT MAKES THE PROCESS EFFORTLESS AND I CANNOT IMAGINE MAKING THE COOKIES WITH THIS TIP
0,Saturdays are pancake days for our family and this little gem makes them perfectly round every time!  Love it!  Batter must be not too think, not too thin, but that's not a problem.  Have had it for 3 years and it's still going strong.  I've purchased two more as gifts for other pancake enthusiasts.  :)
0,Really looks good and adds elegance to the room
0,This is a replacement for one I purchased several years ago, which is a good indication of just how much I like it.
0,When I was given the opportunity to try out this boomerang pillow in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion I agreed because it reminded me of a nursing pillow without the narrow opening. I love the idea of a nursing pillow, but I can't seem to get it close enough to my body to be comfortable. I couldn't' wait for this pillow to arrive to try it out. In my mind, the V shape would make it much easier to get the pillow close to my body to hold my baby boy securely and comfortably for both of us. It arrived today and I tried it out right away and I was right! Perhaps me being overweight stops me from being able to use a nursing pillow as it's intended, but with this boomerang pillow I had no problem. It fits right up against me easily and quickly. Quickly being super important because when he's ready to eat he's ready to eat! It is smaller than I expected, but for what I'm using it for it works great. One bad thing is that I'll probably never have a pillow case for this because of the shape. It comes with a zippered pillowcase but I'm not too crazy over the texture of it. Still, a great pillow for a nursing mom!
0,We love this fountain!  I looked at a lot of different ones and I am so glad this is the one we got.  It is really cute and the sound of the running water is so nice to have in the back yard.
0,Such a great little invention, use my loose leaf tea at work for this. LOVE IT!		Also heated up the cup in the microwave for 2 min and handle didn't get hot.
0,Just what I needed!
0,Really nice for the price, good quality and easy to attach to railings.
0,Perfect size for daily use. Looks cute on the counter. Easy to use. Love it. Will buy as a gift for others in the future.	Yes. Even if you have a big one you will use this one.
0,Purchased for my son for his twin bed then liked so much that again I have purchased again for king sized bed !
0,I bought this to take on vacation. It was perfect. Took up very little room in my suitcase but was a great size when laid out for ironing. I'll never travel without it!
0,The machine is a 5 star machine.  It makes crispy fries, juicy chicken and lovely egg rolls.  It is amazing.  The only thing lacking is thorough an instruction manual and cook book.  It comes with both, but the are very short and limited in details.  If you are good at googling, buy this one and you'll be happy.
0,Glamma and grand kids both love these mugs, have the whole set.
0,Very nice and functional. Not the best quality but performs its function. We love it!
0,This is replacing Sunbeam we have had for 25 years.  This one dose more and cost about the same.  Excellent Product.
0,Easy to assemble and looks nice.  My wife uses it as a display in the living room.  Very sturdy
0,This was just one in a long line of rice cookers I have purchased over the years and several have been made by Zojirushi.	When the Neuro Fuzzy technology appeared, I decided to retire my old Zo and bought one.  I used it regularly for a few years and then the IH came on the market and I just HAD to have one!	I sent this one to my daughter, who uses it almost daily and is extremely pleased with it.	For anyone who cooks rice several times a week, it very soon pays for itself in convenience and getting a perfect rice every time.  (as long as one follows the directions and measures accurately)		I have found both this one and the IH to be very versatile and it can cook a lot more than rice.	Check out the Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook and see just how far you can take it.
0,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!
0,Perfect cover for my down-filled pillow.  It looks great on my couch.  I couldn't have been happier.  The only draw-back was the zipper could have been a bit longer to easily insert the down pillow.  I would recommend it to others.
0,Very pretty
0,I bought this for my mother and she loves it!  It doesn't have any odor smell.  It is a high quality product that really feels great on the feet.  The non-slip suction cups really work, yet it is easy to remove and dry.  After 2 months of use, she hasn't noticed any discoloration or any mildew.  Worth every penny!
0,Great for small laundry room. Exactly what I wanted.
0,I'm one of those people who needs to hear constant noise to fall asleep. I blame it on growing up in the city and hearing sounds 24x7.  I'm hoping this clock can eliminate my need to fall asleep with the television or radio playing. The sleep feature has 15 different sounds can be adjusted in both duration and volume.  Some of the sounds, like train, space, white noise and a couple other duds are more annoying than soothing but almost all of the remaining sounds are relaxing.  The alarm also has different sounds.  These are bells, insects humming, birds chirping or two soothing melodies.  Out of the five, I prefer the birds over the others.  You can also attach a USB music capable device such as a smartphone or MP3 player.  You can select music from the device for your sleep or wake sounds as well as charge the device while it's connected.  It does not have a radio.		The design is basic but Philips even makes basic look pretty.  The round circular clock is mostly fabric with a  wooden circular center surrounded by a silver control band on the top.  I'm pretty certain it's real wood.  If the wood is fake, it is the most convincing looking and feeling fake wood that I have ever encountered.  The bottom of the clock glows in several colors with varying intensity.		As far as performance, it worked quite well.  The alarm isn't the loud blaring type.  I prefer the lighter sounding alarms over the louder ones.  If you are a hard sleeper who requires a fire house bell or an air horn to wake you, this is not the alarm clock for you.  The combination of soothing sounds and warm glowing light actually lulls me to sleep and wakes me up fairly easily.  It has a replaceable backup battery for power outages but it only maintains the time and settings for when power is restored, not full clock features.  It only has a single alarm.  Just a bit of info if you require dual alarms.		Philips included what has to be one of the worst setup/user guides ever.  There is no logical order to the setup instructions, just a bunch of boxes scattered about the page with visual flowcharts showing how to set up different features.  Most of these charts have no text instructions at all and the boxes that do have text have very little that is just above useless.  For the most part, you'll have to figure the majority of the controls on your own using the slight hints provided by the manual.		I currently use a Philips wake-up light clock.  The dual-alarm and FM radio make it a must-keep item.  However, I do use the sound soother at night to fall asleep and the alarm on days where we don't need a dual alarm and I don't want the light to wake my wife. This is a great alarm for soothing you to sleep as well as gently coaxing you awake.
0,Love this art....just love it. One of my favorites.
0,These are a bit smaller than I expected,  but worked perfectly for my daughters birthday cupcakes.
0,I bought these to add to a college gift basket. I love the color and pattern and they feel soft. It was very difficult to find Twin XL at the stores without paying an exorbitant price for a 3-pc set.
0,Honestly, it feels a bit cheap, but it works well and it's so cheap. Plus it's dishwasher safe. This is perfect for chopping garlic.
0,Love these mats for everything from pastries and rolls to cookies. Great value.
0,Love this surge protector, I have a couple of them, going to buy another
0,Arrived promptly, looks great. I feel a little shameful because Mulder wouldn't have framed it, but it looks great next to original movie posters from Transformers and Night of the Living Dead.
0,Does what it is supposed to do. Scrapes well especially when you cook something greasy in the cast-iron pans. The edges of the scrapers glide around the corners scraping every last bit of stubborn grease or food particle. Expensive? YES. But I just thought of buying a "branded" one rather than getting a similar one from the dollar store.
0,Very nice pillow cases.  This is the second set we have purchased.
0,Just as advertised.
0,So far so good! I've use this pan to cook a few times already and it was very nice. It is very easy to clean with just a soft sponge (not a scrubber sponge). It cooks food evenly and is large enough to fit enough pieces of meat for my family of 4. My only complaint is I wish the "grill" ridges were deeper. They are a bit shallow, so food still sits in the grease, which defeats the whole point of choosing a grill pan over a regular pan.
0,Works great. a sure aid for older arthritic hands
0,It arrived on time and my sister loved it so I'm happy.
0,Adorable, high quality bunting that is perfect for your Christmas party or family room - it goes well in both! I received a sample and from the quality I received, I wouldn't hesitate to buy more for friends or different holidays or occasions. High quality cardstock and easy to assemble.
0,Nice but I thought it would be heavier. So far it has not disappointed and we use it several times a week
0,I am seriously impressed by this little scale.  I bought it to keep at work and it's been great!  Easy to use and compact.  Love it!
0,Fits perfectly in the guest bathroom
0,My first cast-iron skillet! I used it for steak and it was so yummy and crispy on the outside. My new favorite skillet!!
0,I was looking for something that could separate darks, lights, and my two childrens clothes. All I can say is that I wish I had bought this a long time ago. Seriously with being a busy mom it makes laundry so much easier!  It was way easy to put together and the instructions were very clear! The only thing that might concern people is the size of each basket. It was concerning to me for a second, but they hold a lot more clothes than you would think! I love this laundry basket and would recommend it to anyone.
0,I like these because I think it's hard to wash pillows and I think pillows smell bad after awhile from the oil on hair.  These are a smart purchase because they are easy to wash as opposed to washing the pillows.  Good price.
0,I gave this to my Sister as a gift and she says she loves it. She also liked the opening in the handle so she could hang some if she chooses to.
0,This pan really kicks ass and is everything I hoped for out of a non-stick pan such great value for $30!
0,Well constructed and very comfortable. Heats up quickly and stays warm. Now let's see how long it holds up but for right now loving it!
0,Wonderful quality. My table looks beautiful. So many compliments.
0,Looks amazing and was easy to install. very impressed
0,LOVE IT!  warms up in 5 minutes, holds warmth unplugged for about an hour.  I just this for our homeowners association get together's monthly.  Wonderful option for warm dishes when no electricity is available.
0,Though it is my wife who predominantly uses the bottom of the stairs to store items, I have found it quite useful. Now I can bring the basket full of items upstairs, dump it on the bed and return. My wife is a bit reluctant to put clothes in it though for fear of snagging on the wicker.
0,It was a gift, they loved it.
0,Excellent design in terms of doing the job.	What's Right:  Getting a lot of laundry into a compact area.  The use of sturdy steel for the central post.  Ability to remove from ground and store.	What's Wrong:  a) The support arms are made of 3/4 inch aluminum tubing but they bend under the weight of wet laundry.  2) The articulating pivots are so weak that they deform if you tighten the clothesline too tightly.  3) The two end pivots in the shape of a hook are not held in position by the flimsy vinyl "peg" and slide out of its correct position.  4)  The plastic components will degrade in prolonged sunlight (I'm in FL).	DIY retrofit:  1)  Cut 4 pieces of 45" long 3/4 inch STEEL tubing and reinforce the 4 radial aluminum arms in binding them together with hoseclamps.  2)  Use hose clamps as stops to prevent the two end-rod hooks from sliding out of position  3) Protect plastic from UV degradation with plastic paint or rubberlized coating.	Recommendations to Manufacturer:  a)  Use steel tubing, not aluminum  OR Use at least 1 in aluminum tubing  b) Make pivots out of stainless steel c) Redesign end-rod hooks to prevent slipping out of position.
0,I love this quilt and am thinking about buying the matching bedroom set. It's a really nice quality!		The overall color is a little darker than in the photo but I expected that from other comments. It's a very nice sand color.
0,This little burner is really lovely.  I used it as soon as I got it.  It fits the charcoal in perfectly.	I saw a few confused reviews on how this item is used.	Here us a youtube video on how this burner us used. https://youtu.be/j5BTuy-vXgY
0,Used several times to make little bows for accents on cakes. Works great, I'm sure I'll have for years to come and look forward to what I'll be making using this great mold
0,The filter is used for my whole house.  However, I have 2 other normal 20x20x1 in filters that pre filter air before it hits this one.  I expect it to last a year.  It is very flimsy but much lower cost that Lowes unit that appears to be higher filter quality.  It would be good to review my choice next year.  Need to be careful and not pick a filter that blocks the airflow too much.  Also check your unit measurements as all filters are not quite 4 in thick sometimes.
0,Product was as nice as advertised. heavy well built
0,I have never had a cast iron teapot before.  This one is wonderful.  I don't think I will ever settle for a ceramic teapot ever again.  The weight of it just adds to the pleasure of pouring the tea.	The dimensions are ideal and the teapot is much more beautiful than the photo looks.  Inside and out the craftsmanship is very apparent.	I will definitely getting more from Old Dutch.  The price from Amazon is unbeatable.
0,Threw away too many cheese cutters with flimsy wire.  This one has a blade and works great.  Won't be tossing this one!
0,Very convenient if you use a tablecloth to cover your dining table. Cleans off any crumbs in just a few seconds.
0,Bought this so my grandkids and can stay over and have their own bed instead of kicking me in the head or falling off my bed.  They tend to move all around the bed during the night, and this is perfect.  Easy to inflate/deflate and store.  Only wish the motor wasn't so darned loud - like a vacuum cleaner, but louder.
0,We needed some artwork for our Airbnb apartment, without breaking the bank. These are perfect for what we needed them for. As others have said, the canvas is not super thick and high-quality, but the pictures are clear with vivid colors. We are pleased with this purchase. You certainly cannot beat the price.
0,I originally bought just the giant frying pan to try out this ceramic non-stick business, and it was fantastic! So a few months later we bought the whole set. These are really nice pans. Absolutely nothing sticks. Even if you burn something it still slides right off. Now I can make omelettes and hash browns with out them sticking to the pan and getting ruined. I hand-wash mine and use silicone cooking utensils, and so far so good with the coating.
0,I bought this digital scale because I needed a way to measure out exactly the dry ingredients for my "baklava" recipe.	Also, a lot of the recipes included more than measurements of cups and teaspoons. I needed a way to measure out oz and lbs.	This scale is very accurate and easy to use for these purposes.	I've only used it a few times, but so far it works just great. It's so convenient because it's small and easy to carry.	I love this scale and use it for baking and portion control.	The scale is easy to use and makes cooking by weight a breeze.	This scale is as described. It works great. Compact size, great for storing between uses.
0,Nice and sturdy. Fit easily into a standard spice jar.
0,Even my wife who is South Indian said that these are high quality cups. She was surprised at the price, quality, and craftsmanship. When you don't have to have your family fly them in from India, that is saying something.
0,Beautifuk
0,Very warm and soft. Received on time and undamaged. Very happy with this purchase.
0,I ordered 2 of those for my ejuice flavors. They easily hold 30ml bottle (as well as 15 and 10ml too). Mine  arrived in perfect condition and went together quickly. I am now able to see all my flavor in alphabetical order when I'm mixing my DIY ejuices. I'm very happy with this purchase.		4 oz bottles are too big for this rack, so I ordered the Copco Non-Skid 3-Tier Cabinet Organizer for those.
0,Works super well with the brown sugar and with turbinado sugars and palm sugars.  Even without moistening the clay disc.
0,good frame
0,great little Dutch oven.  Works wonderful now that it is just the Husband and I at home.
0,I like this product but be sure you realize that it is a lot of work. I use 38 grams of coffee beans and it takes between 150-200 rotations of the handle to grid that up to a fairly course grind. I'm okay with it, but it is more of a workout then I had anticipated.
0,Best non stick cookie sheet ever!  I love it.
0,ok
0,I put this handy dandy organizer is in my walk in closet to hold my costumer jewelry and it is great. No more digging around in my top dresser drawer. I can easily find what I'm looking for.
0,The quality of this crystal butter dish met all expectations for the price.  I use it alot and it looks very decorative on my table.
0,easy to put together, looks really good, lots of space
0,Fast delivery and good product!
0,It a potato masher.  I wish I could say more, but it is what it is.  It is sturdy and makes great mashed potatoes.  Very glad I bought it.  It's not some revolutionary masher that is changing kitchens around the globe, but it does a good job at what it was designed to do.
0,Great am buying more
0,Excellent bags
0,I have a yellow wall that works great with these curtains. The flowers are sewn on in a three-dimensional way (I don't know what the fabric term is, but they pop out a bit), and I can see some people thinking that's odd. But, I find them very cheerful and again, have received numerous compliments about them.
0,Fit deep pocket matress, but super wrinkly
0,What I wanted, look like pictures
0,I love them! Can fill them a little or a lot, depending on the size ice cubes I want. And they're easy to pop out of the try.
0,This is a lovely canvas. It looks wonderful in the room giving it a peaceful, beachy feel, which is what I wanted. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars, though, is because  the colors weren't quite as vibrant as it looks on the computer. But, I wasn't disappointed enough to want to send it back! I do like it in my room!
0,I purchased two&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sanyo-ABC-VW24-Air-Washer-Air-Purification-System-with-Electrolyzed-Water-Technology/dp/B002YD9C78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sanyo ABC-VW24 Air Washer Air Purification System with Electrolyzed Water Technology</a>&nbsp;units July 2011.		I've mostly used them with only the pre-filter (the Electrolyzed Water Technology works without the filter anyway) but ordered one to decide if the shipping worked out.		For about $18 shipping on top of the price it arrived in good condition and the entire system is working fine.
0,loved it! just what I was looking for.
0,If you need a simple black frame for 4x6 photos choose this one. It has nice solid construction and the black finish is easy to clean and hard to scratch.		It'a easy to access the pictures by flipping the tabs in the back and removing the backing. It can be hung or placed on a table top thanks the kickstand behind it.
0,I love this stuff! it works really well for what i needed and comes of even after weeks of being on my cabinet surface. It worked better for me when i cleaned and wiped down the cabinets first but for the most part... awesome. i bought one roll for 95% of the kitchen and bathroom.. there is A LOT of this stuff on one roll. If i didn't mess up a couple times which was bound to happen, i would have had enough for the entire kitchen and bathroom. I have a TON of cabinets (see photos so you can see just how much this roll covers - did before and after pics. the black is the after finish). It took a while but im also a student so i didn't spend night and day on this and just took my time. Since im in an apartment and felt the kitchen was super outdated, i decided a temporary face lift would spruce it up but it went beyond my expectations. you don't even understand how easy it is to remove this... it leaves ZERO residue... almost like those awesome pice tags on glass that just peel right off and don't rip or tear. some people on here said it doesnt stick but again, a cleaner surface will give better results, that and having the patience to do it right. Im really excited to share my photos because when i first bought this i didn't see anyone doing what i was planning so i took a gamble and it worked out!. Hopefully these pics will help others trying to do something similar.		anyhow, im a huge fan of this stuff and since i bought a second roll to finish the last few cabinets, i have a ton left over to use on something else... and trust me, i'll probably use it all and then buy more! The best part is even though its easy to remove, it doesnt come off on its own. we have slammed and banged and threw open some of those drawers and cabinet doors and the stuff sticks! the only way its coming off is if we peel it off. i love my new kitchen and bathroom but im paying for a cheap apartment still! this made my place look a million times better. so happy.
0,Love these bags! Price is great! Will be a repeater customer.
0,Not as sturdy as I imagined but they get the job done if I'm careful.
0,Simple, cheap, and gets the job done.
0,I bought these Spoons to make my Artisan Bread Recipes from Steve's No-Knead Bread Books. I'm so happy with them they're perfect. They arrived on the day expected and packaged very well.	Thank you,Mary Lou :)
0,They are exactly what I need.  Have enough to give to friends.
0,I agree with many others - great for the price.  There are more realistic looking ones out there but they're almost twice the price.  From a distance, they all look about the same.
0,It's been almost 2 months since I got this egg cooker pan and it hasn't let us down. This pan should be paired with a mini-spatula to make it easy to flip the contents.	The heat is distributed evenly to the 3 cups which means consistent eggs.	So far we only used the pan for eggs, sausage patties, pork rolls and bacon. I don't this we'll be making pancakes in this pan simply because we like them bigger but we may try.	The pan is easy to clean. Highly recommended.	Now excuse me while I go back to my sandwiches before they cool down.
0,Nicely made, had to send back though, my bad. Needed the $900.00 unit to run it. :)
0,What I like about this liner is that it has just the right amount of thickness and the grommets are made nice and sturdy.
0,Warning: The ivory colored towels look taupe in the pictures, however they are indeed ivory. Nonetheless, they are beautiful and I adore the fluffy shaping. If you would like a reference to their true color, select the 20x32 size in ivory and look at the picture with all four color choices.
0,Good quality and price.  5-Stars.
0,One of my favorite utensils.  I use it every day and it is perfect!!
0,I got these to go on a carnival cruise and they passed with flying colors.  No questions asked the bags showed up at our door, there was no spilling.  They are a little over priced considering they are just 2 empty shampoo bottles but worth the savings on the ship.
0,I have had the dutch oven for about a month now and used it numerous times for soups, stews and making dutch oven bread.  I am very pleased with its' quality. It distributes the heat well and cleaning it is a breeze. I fully expect this to last decades. The price also couldn't be beat - $49.30!  I would recommend the Lodge Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven either for personal use or as a gift.
0,a lovely addition to the nativity we purchased last year!
0,Bought for my wife for Valentines. She loves them. Have purchased these over the years, and have be satisfied with the workmanship.
0,Used this on my front door to hang decorations on.  It hold wreaths just fine.  Would def recomment to anyone.
0,Gave as a gift.  My brother loved it.
0,I purchased this for a granddaughter who loves to make cupcakes and cookies.  Seeing how well made this is and with it having so many different uses, I am ordering one for myself.  Love it....wished I would have thought of this.
0,I ended up buying 4 of these. two for my living room as end tables and two in my bedroom as nightstands. I love them the are simple they are small. the color is perfect for my color scheme. and the coating they put on it is really tough which I need. I also bought the leaning shelves and the two console tables the rectangle one and the rounded one. rounded one is behind my couch. Love these pieces.

0,The a/c was a great price and seems to work well although we live in San Diego so will only use it occasionally. The disappointment was really frustrating since there was a $30 rebate offer which I attempted to apply for without any luck since the serial number was not anywhere to be found on the a/c as described and my email to the company went unanswered. In my opinion this is bad business and the term "bad faith" is fitting. Do companies really want happy customers who recommend them to others or not? I will not be unless my email is answered and my $30 is sent. In this day and age a person like myself does not have time to send multiple correspondence to the company and therefore just lose out and lose faith so good luck. Lisle.
0,Worked perfectly.
0,It's so perfect and it really gives character to our office lounge area. My husband is obsessed with it and he's very picky. I know it's a great pick when he feels the need to vocalize his appreciation lol the size is more of an A4 paper or slightly bigger. I thought they were square, but I'm even happier about the fact that they're bigger than I thought. This would be great on top of a bed, on your hallway above a console. Anywhere you put this will be a conversation starter.
0,This centerpiece is FAB I'm so glad I noticed it. Thank you.
0,I bought a 10pk of the P-51s and another 10pk of the P-38s to give as sets to my friends for Christmas.  They were all very impressed with the function of these small and lightweight can openers.  Now we'll all have them in our go-bags.  I also gave a set to my dad who carries them on his key ring, and gave another set to a friend who served in Vietnam.  He was thrilled to receive them, since he lost his original ones years ago.  I've test-driven mine several times and they work exactly as they say.  I am even more proud to have them as they are all made in America!
0,Great coffee for a pod system.  Actually, amazingly creamy and hot coffee.  I had Nespresso coffee for a week recently in a hotel, and the Illy coffee is far superior.  Does both caf crme and espresso.  Holding the brew button down, you can do caf Americano as well.		I bought this on Amazon before I realized Illy is giving this machine to anyone who buys 12 cans of iperespresso pods.  I think it's a great deal (until Dec 7, 2015, I believe).
0,prefect for a lucy fan
0,I bought these pot holders to match our retro-styled kitchen. They're nice and sturdy, a pretty color, and arrived in perfect shape.
0,Easy to assemble, a space-saver, & it looks very nice in my livingroom!  Would highly recommend!
0,Very nice for a much better price than others I have seen.
0,very very cozy
0,These sheets are a beautiful color.  They wash perfectly and do not wrinkle.  However, I have a pretty good sized mattress and within a couple days these seem to stretch.  Great price - probably would buy again even with the stretching.
0,Fits my shower perfectly. I bought another for when this eventually gets covered with water deposits.
0,Lovely deep bowl, thin stem, thin crystal....I enjoy drinking wine from these glasses and my guests all ask me where I found them....architectural shape, well made, not heavy.
0,Great Product, Price And Service.
0,A+ for the company who was very responsive when I realized there was a sticker on the back, which freaked me out because I have brand new cork floors I fear could get scratched, so I started to pull the sticker off only to find that it was taking the rug with it! I told the company & they offered to exchange it.		I like the rug so much I decided not to do the exchange. I just asked that they put a warning on the sticker to NOT REMOVE IT. I keep the rug in a high traffic area where my active dog goes in & out. So far it's easy to care for & still looks as bright as the other one I keep in a different, low-traffic area.		The sticker on the back of both does not seem to be doing any harm to my sensitive floors. Whew.
0,Excalibur is the best.....I love dehydrating my foods......Onion  Bread is one of my favorites, recipe can be found in RAWvolution.
0,100% Satis.
0,This arrived with a really rough edge on the bottle opener part from the machining of it.  The edge would have sliced your finger open.  A few minutes with a metal file and it was nice and smooth. Strangely, I emailed John J Steuby about the sharp ridges and they never bothered to respond to me.  It is still a great can opener.  I got this to replace my swing a way which I misplaced and have since found.  I got the red handles because it is easier to find in a drawer.
0,Perfect.
0,So far these seem to be hook song up ok. They go through the dishwasher just fine. They haven't stained at all despite holding some of the most dreaded leftovers a container could come into contact with: the unrelenting tomato sauce. We don't often microwave in them but they have survived the microwave a few times with no issue. My only complaint with these is that the smallest containers are so small they are pretty useless unless you are putting about a 1/4 cup of seeds or something else super tiny. Maybe baby food or salad dressing? And the biggest tall containers are a bit too tall To fit on most of the shelves in my fridge. I wind up reserving spots in the design just for this containers other wise we have to play the constant shuffle and juggle to fit them.  And we all know much much fun it is the play fridge container Tetris and hope nothing liquid hits the floor at the perfect angle to pop open and feed the dog a special treat.
0,Perfect for my wedding business. Will buy again. Don't hesitate to buy these. Really nice quality.
0,Okay, what can I say about these gaskets? They fit and seem to be made of good material. So far, no leakage. That makes 'em a 5 in my book.
0,Great product
0,Have had canner pressure cookers before...but like the use ability of 3 separate sized weights...instead of the stack weights...this is more accurate...have never trusted guages...since over a time it loses it's accuracy...also like use doubling as a water bath unit...
0,I bought two 8" chef's knives six months ago; one 8" victorinox and one 8" mercer millenia. Both knives are a great value and I would recommend both to any home cook. The victorinox is heavier, better finished, and feels like it will last longer than the mercer. The mercer is thinner, lighter and feels sharper.		I have no complaints with the victorinox, but for some reason I almost always reach for the mercer.  I prefer the mercer because the thinner blade makes it feel sharper and I prefer lighter knives.
0,Very nice duvet, put together nicely. Pictures are very accurate colors
0,Very easy to use and clean.
0,I HATE the taste and texture of day-old avocado. With that being said, I was incredibly surprised and pleased that this piece of plastic does what it is supposed to do (for the most part). If you aren't a professional avocado cutter it probably won't fit perfectly on the saver, but it does save the majority of the avocado from getting gross. My boyfriend, who rolled his eyes at my purchase, is even impressed.		It's cheap and it can't be any worse than putting your avocado in a piece of plasticware AND you may become a professional avocado cutter after using it a few times.
0,larger than I imagined - but they do the trick.  I actually wanted one so I could clean my makeup brushes (something I saw on a video).  Now that I have all four - I will use them for all manner things in the kitchen and out.
0,Very nice retro look. Had it for couple weeks only but so far it works great!
0,JUST WHAT I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR.
0,Product looks exactly like the picture
0,This is my 8th vornado. I have been using them for approximately 15-20 yrs. They are quiet, but very	effective. The ones that I have had, have lasted a minimum of 10 yrs. As long as they perform this well,I	will continue to buy them.
0,This is just  exactly what I was looking for. The fabric is heavy duty and the color is perfect. I loved it so much I ordered two more.
0,Perfect..  Just what I was looking for.
0,Enhanced our experience in a surprising way.  Who knew a glass could do so much.
0,Careful, this bad boy it SHARP.
0,I was thinking about buying a new ironing board then I decide to try this cover. I trusted the brand and glad that I was right. It made my very old ironing board brand new! It's thick and arrived very quickly. I can recommend this product to everyone.
0,very happy no one can seen and I can hide in my home without any one knowing I am here. TY:)
0,It's plastic but the safe kind of plastic. Great for taco night and keeping the shells warm for fajitas or whatever.
0,It's a good mat but takes some time to get it stuck down well.
0,I use these in regular size muffin pans to prevent spill over.  They make a beautiful, tall muffin.
0,Anyone with pets can relate to this common problem.  You go to vacuum your home and instantly the room smells like a herd of wild animals hosted an overnight binge in the living room.  What to do?  You can: 1) Change out the bag between each room, or 2) Get scented tabs for your vacuum.  You're smart, so I'm sure you'll opt for #2.		At first shake I was scared these were going be an overly sweet "grandma's bathroom potpourri" smell, but I was pleasantly surprised to find these scented tablets had a very clean, fresh smell -- reminiscent of freshly washed linens.		Directions state to put one of these white tabs into your vacuum bag, but I found it much easier to simply break the tablets into quarters and vacuum it straight into the bag.  Boom, done!  Now each time my wife and I use the vacuum, I almost forget we have animals...that is, until it's time to clean the litter box.
0,Good quality.
0,Nice thick bath rugs.
0,Excellent Product !!
0,Works great!  Aired it out a bit when I first opened the package.  The chemical smell dissipated quickly, and the rug pad is now doing its job of keeping us safe.  Would recommend and buy again -- a bit more expensive than competitors, but totally worth it.
0,You can carry just about anything in these things and they will not fall apart. I use them constantly.
0,Super mideaval looking.  Bought 2.  Am putting one at the top and the other at the bottom of my stair case.
0,More sheer than I expected (based on their picture) but still a nice curtain for the price.
0,This is wonderful, we've bought three so far...one for us, one for a Mother's Day gift, and one for a graduation gift.  It is so much fun to choose the pictures, and I love that you can change them.  We even found pictures for the top.
0,These are the best insulated travel mugs ever.  They are very easy to clean. There is a mechanism in the lid that moves out of the way allowing the entire inside and outside of the lid to be cleaned. Leak proof and drip proof when lid used correctly.  Keeps coffee hot for hours. Will buy more for our house and for gifts.
0,Works well for the price
0,It is identical to our old one that we had for over 11 years, but it was showing a lot of wear and tear. So was happy to see it on Amazon, and it seems to have a better frame structure than mpour old one, so they had improved on the solid frame design.  Let's hope,it last another 11 plus years: at under $1 a year: best value ever!  Pretty big and filling one of these baskets is good for one of those industrial sized front load machines!
0,I love OXO products, so I ordered this. I love this tool, it is very well made, I love this thing.
0,The wait and the time spent assembling was worth it. The frosted doors are a great touch and it is plenty sturdy enough for a normal flatscreen TV. It looks really great in my living room.		Here are some thoughts though:		It seems like a bit of oversight to not make the top level shelves tall enough to store DVD's or even Blu-Ray cases (which are shorter) upright in. It doesn't look terrible to have them stacked flat, but you lose storage space because there is extra space that is not used.		The instructions are not necessarily the most simple. The boards are labeled with letter/numbers to help the process along, but it's kind of overwhelming when you open the box up.		Despite these things, I am still very happy with the appearance and construction.
0,great and look well too
0,Raised a table we have between two chairs. Voila! Perfecto
0,Bought one tried it. Loves it.  Bought 2 more as gifts.
0,True to color. No rust. No burns on the bottom
0,Perfect finish n my nautical shower curtain!
0,I've been using yogurt makers at home for years now using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Euro-Cuisine-YM100-Automatic-Yogurt-Maker/dp/B001KZM4Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Euro-Cuisine YM100 Automatic Yogurt Maker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yolife-Yogurt-Maker-YL-210/dp/B001DZ8S5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yolife Yogurt Maker (YL-210)</a>&nbsp;with which I have made very thick and creamy yogurt. What I will stress first is that making your own yogurt at home is not about saving money or time, it's all about ingredient control. Once you get the hang of it it's relatively easy but you do have to follow the steps exactly and it's absolutely imperative to use a thermometer to test the milk temperature before you add your yogurt culture or you will not create anything but a sour, soupy, unusable mess.		This yogurt maker does a good job and provides a more convenient way to make Greek yogurt, as well as providing specific instructions for what kind of milk you start with, which is very useful. However, it turns out that homemade Greek yogurt is just a bit too messy and involved for my taste. If you're after a Greek yogurt maker you won't be disappointed. Just be sure to get and use a thermometer as well.
0,Very cute for a child's bathroom
0,Bought it!  Just like the Swing-Away from the old days...  not quite as heavy  as my old one, but glad to say  it WORKS!!
0,Love this vege peeler! Can't go wrong.
0,Love this! Met all my expectations and some.
0,Lul.  How do you review something like this?		It looks creepy and that's probably why you're buying it, right?
0,Heavy duty, won't bend or break and perfect for getting into spice jars.
0,I ordered the smaller of the stands.  I fill it with wrapped candies and my kids and grand-kids love trying to figure out how to grab a candy without the rest of the contents spilling.  No, I do not use it for cupcakes or cakes or tarts or whatever.  I refuse to bake.  The trick is obvious, turn the entire unit over so the glass is filled with the candy and choose whatever.  My entertainment is watching everyone in my family try to solve this trick.  It's endlessly entertaining and I can see who, in the family, is a problem solver, a risk taker, who plays it safe and on and on.  Can you tell I am a therapist??!!
0,I received this product free in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.		This is a unique egg cooker! It's very easy to use and easy to clean. The plus side of using this is that you don't have to cook on the stove and dirty a pan that might take forever to come clean. Instead, toss an egg or four in this ceramic cooker and place it in the microwave for the time shown on the suggested cooking chart. The problem I had with the chart is that I had to cook it about 30 seconds to a minute longer. I followed the time on the chart for two eggs and I still had runny egg whites. If you're like me, this completely grosses me out. I cooked it longer and still had some fluffy eggs. I did have another problem with it when I did my daughter's eggs. I do not suggest putting milk in with your eggs. This Egg-Tastic cooker makes them fluffy enough if you scramble them, you do not have to add anything to it. I made the mistake of adding some milk and it came out wet and liquidy after 2 minutes of cook time, which is double the time for one egg.		This cleans out very easily if you rinse it out ahead of time. If not, you will have to let it soak a little bit to get the egg out. I give it four stars just because the cook time is a bit longer than the suggested time and it doesn't cook the eggs entirely like I expected. It's a nice item to have in the house, especially since my husband has to make himself breakfast before work early in the morning. This makes nice eggs that he can enjoy cooking for himself. I highly recommend it for someone who does not like to cook on the stove, or who wants an alternative way to cooking their eggs in the morning or whenever.
0,perfect for space saving
0,Look like the real thing
0,Love this
0,Excellent quality
0,As described and on time
0,Beautiful! Gift for a friend. She loved it!
0,This is my second set I have purchased.  They are awesome. They are lightweight but I add a colorful throw and it looks great. Oversized and they fit my king size very well, Lots hanging over the side. Wash beautifully.  My only problem is they don't have a very large variety of colors.  I have the taupe and this green one.  Absolutely recommend
0,Keeps my pets and roomba away from the fire.
0,Wish it comes in size 3 x 7
0,Works best on medium sized ears...wont make it to bottom of jumbo.
0,This is a cheap and awesome food scale!
0,At first I was skeptical to purchase because I was unsure of how well they would work. I was pleasantly surprised.  We used them for the first time in Nov. and the bags did not leak air at all.  Would order again.
0,Love this rug! I find the colors to be blue and tan, true to size and flattened from being rolled quite quickly. It may be important to note, like all faus-distressed rugs, the design looks a little digitized up close. I think this is a quality rug for the price and I would purchase again. I've received many compliments from guests.
0,My wife loves it and makes bread and coffee cake with it
0,I am giving the fan 4 stars rather than 5 because it's a bit noisy-but then all the fans I have bought seem to have this limitation. Except for this feature, it is perfect. I has sufficient power so the breeze reaches quite a distance. Moreover, it is very reasonably priced.
0,Works like it should
1,Looks pretty good except the 2 upper shelves don't fit properly.  Wondering if the right ones were sent?
1,Teeny!  Am returning it!
1,Rigid nature of the frame (being steel) did not allow for any wiggle room when inserted into the frame (simple metal frame) we purchased for it. They had to be shoved in with great effort and force. I would not recommend this unless you are absolutely sure your frame will fit it appropriately.
1,Started to peel off after a little over a month.
1,I have used the Jura Decalcifying/Descaling tablets for over a year on my Jura automatic espresso/coffee machine, and they seem to work well.
1,Even with multiple passes, the expelled solids still contain a lot of juice (and they're half-cooked due to the heat from friction).  I've tried greens and wheat grass, and neither juice well with this device.
1,Will not stay on chair...and backing sensitive to heat...hubby melted the backing first time drying it....
1,Things always stick in cracks and crevices thought this would be perfect of candy or baking but things seem to stick in the little crevices even if I oil these.  I tried several different way but just don't work.  Gave away to good will!
1,Fair warning that I'm exceptionally biased and probably not using this chair the way you would: fully reclined all the time. My previous desk chair finally gave out after years of abuse & makeshift repairs, snapping the plastic arms in several places on each side. Here, the arms are thinner and I see the same thing happening much more quickly. Beyond that, the actual seat cushion is thin (versus *plush*) and the seam about 1/3 from the front has a horribly uncomfortable ridge below it which makes you feel like you're sitting on a metal bar. Not as much of an issue when you're sitting up straight and it's below your thighs, but if you're fully reclined it's in the worst possible place. The backrest is thinner than I expected; the profile picture makes it appear thicker than it actually is, and in no position, reclined or sitting up straight, is there comfortable support for your head, neck, or shoulders which defeats the purpose of a high-backed chair.		UPDATE: 9/4/2013, four months later. One of the arms finally snapped in two places simultaneously. Guess who won't be buying one of these a second time?
1,Terry cloth kinda cheap. Mine was used but even so looks faded and old. Not like pictures
1,I guess for the price, I should have expected it to be cheaply made, but I had to get pliers and bend the door latch to get it to close.  I ordered the Blue Glass lantern but received a multi-colored one.  I figured for the price it wasn't worth the effort of returning for the correct one.  The hook on the top was completely twisted and bent and I still haven't got it back into shape for fear that if I keep messing with it, it's going to completely break off.		Anytime I attempt to open the door and latch, it feels like it's going to fall apart.  You can hear every single piece of glass slide around with even the slightest movement.		We thought about re-ordering just to get the correct color, but after having it for a few days, we don't feel like it's even worth the cheap listed price.
1,Too big and musty smelling
1,Anything with compression fittings sucks. I spent 2 days fixing leaks from compression fittings, after all the leaks were fixed the filter works OK. Cannot notice a big taste difference, when I replace the filter I will try a D-30 maybe that will make a difference.  Just out of the box I would not recommend this filer.
1,I am tired of it falling down and breaking my razors.  I tried all different ways of putting it up but no success.
1,The first time I cooked rice in one of these, it fried to the bottom. Since I've decided not to use these for cooking grains. The non-stick capacity is amazing and almost bizarre, like nothing touches the pot and with each stir the bottom is wiped clean. However, these chip incredibly easy. I have no idea how the 'ceramic' is chipping so easily as I don't put them in the dishwasher and am mindful not to use metal spoons. But, even at a tap of a spoon on the top edge, these chip. I wish the ceramic were thicker/more durable. I expected them to last more than a month. Yes, still usable, but I can't imagine how bad these will look after a year.
1,After trying to use this can opener for a year, I've finally given up and decided to write a review panning it... why should anyone else have to go through using one of these when it's clearly not worth the trouble.  It falls apart whenever I try to set it up to open a can, and if there's the slightest irregularity in the can's edge, this can opener can't deal with it.  Also, it takes extra effort to properly align it for recharging.  I can't even guess how many times I've put this can opener down in disgust and reached for my good old-fashioned manual can opener!  Save yourself the time, money and aggrivation by avoiding the Black and Decker KEC600 Cordless Can Opener.
1,First off, I rarely leave reviews as I just don't have time with the amount of work I do and the amount of items I buy on amazon,These hands down are the biggest pile of garbage I ever bought! All due to the light sensors. Every single one has a different brightness! Half of them flicker at different brightness and the others are just all different. I figured $30 for 6 lights I would get something decent. Boy was I wrong. The sensors are built into the stem so its not like you can just cover it with tape. I wrapped all of them from top to bottom in black electrical tape to keep them at full power as I use a timer. The amount of time it took to unpackage them and get them all set up I just want to smash them with a hammer.
1,While I like the scent, I couldn't believe how fast the cone burned. I have some stick incense I enjoy (not very expensive), and they last for 20-30 minutes. The cone Maroma sells here burned in about 7 minutes. Smelled great, a lot of scent and smoke, but man, the thing burned out very fast. I've also had some similar rectangular-shaped incense, and those burned for 30 min. Maybe these aren't compressed enough? Who knows.		Anyway, the thing is, I paid $4.50 for this small box of 10 incense cones (.45 cents each!) and I don't get a lot of enjoyment out of them, unlike the other sticks I have. If I only paid $2 for the box, I probably wouldn't be here complaining about it. But $4.50 for incense that burns in just after 5 minutes?
1,They just seem pretty cheap and thin. I've had other sheets that were around the same price and microfiber that didn't feel so thin like these sheets do. I was also hoping that the band on the corner of the sheets would help them stay better (this is mainly why I chose them), I have a thick mattresses so that also why I needed deep corners. However, I have found that the bands don't keep the sheet in place and the Length of the cornes aren't quite as long as I'd like them to be because the sheets are popping off at the corners after a couple nights sleep in them.	Although the sheets are soft, I'm just a bit disappointed in general with the other qualities.
1,I purchased this to make mini muffins for school lunches. I used it for the first time today to make miniature corn dog muffins and they were completely ruined. They looked fine when I took them out of the oven, but when I went to turn them out, they stuck to the pan and came out in chunks. Total waste of money.
1,I read the reviews, from the reviews I decided it would be firmer, even though it says plush .So disappointed .I really needed a new mattress and this is horrible ,it sags and has indents and I am an average person. It is squishy soft. READ this review if you have ever needed or had a firm mattress cause this one is for sure "plush" mush. Wish it could be exchanged, live and learn to trust your own judgments.
1,This was a pretty mat when I received it but in the 9 months I've had it the color has worn off the side that faces the center of the kitchen.  It is now white.  I am the only one living here so it's not like it has had a lot of wear.  I'm going to replace it with something different that I'm hoping lasts longer.
1,I have to start by saying the knives are excellent....	But the block is horrible ...	first off it takes up a lot of space for the # of knives...	Its a straight pull which i have come to realize I don't like....	But worst off its put together like a grade school project...lopsided...it is like a bad table joke really...	and can't be adjusted to fix it either...I tried...	Also the knife slots are specific you can't relocate the knives to accommodate what you preference maybe for frequency of use...	Its bad enough I won't even regift it I will salvage the knives and find a different block....
1,Have had it in use for 6 months notice no positive effect . Would not recommend this device.
1,Ended up buying the full size Spiralizer and this on is just inadequate.
1,missing top rack - just tried to assemble and has only 4 shelves and three broken clips
1,Arrived with a pretty good sized chip missing, exposing a flat white, dull rock that's been coated. The packaging was intact and seemed effective, so it had to have been packed that way.
1,This motor worked fine for the three times I used it.  We were away for two months and then the next time I went to use it, the ON switch would not work.  The PULSE switch worked and, of course, it was only guaranteed for 30 days for return with Amazon.  So here I am stuck with a motor that will only work if the pulse is held down the entire time the dough goes through.  My husband helped me by holding the pulse switch down so I could get the dough through as I already had made the dough. Have to try and contact the manufacturer.
1,Sorry, but this vacuum was way overpriced, and lasted only about four months. During the first few months, I was so happy with it, I bought one for my daughter too.  We both loved it until it was just past being able to return it, then they both started jamming, hard to clean, stuff would get trapped up inside between the bottom and the canister.  Then, I noticed dirt shooting out behind me, it would suck up the dirt, then I would look behind me and there it was all over the floor.  Short battery life too.  My $40 Red Devil held up better and lasted longer than this one.
1,Worked for a month and then threw it away !!!
1,Classes were way too small for Scotch or Whiskey...returned them.
1,I write this review and give only one star as a mom who wanted to be able to pack lunches a bit easier for my three children.  First time we used it was today ... and, first day the top cracked.  My other two children could not fit the product in their lunch boxes because of the lip of the container.  So, they are unable to use it without me spending money on new lunch boxes.  I tried to send back; but, they are almost $8 shipping to send back.  So, this is a waste of money to me.  If I was a person using it at home for lunches at home, it would be great (and would have given more stars).  However, this is not a sturdy/durable product for travel outside the home.
1,Impossible to wash off, not impressed. Anything sticks to it & stains the metal horribly. I mean everything, oil, potatoes, meat, frozen french fries ect. The pan looks like its 50years old & survived a war but it has been used 7x. I am glad I am not cooking with aluminum because I know that can leech into our food but the aluminum commercial grade pan sold on amazon is made in the USA, this pan is made in China.
1,Cups were not as big as I thought and the handle is a little awkward to hold.  I like the ability to stack them and the quality, though.  I would not purchase these again.
1,this is made from plastic and broke off when I was trying to install it on the wall, I would not recommend this at all.	very flimsy
1,Not what I was expecting at all.  Waste.
1,much smaller than than anticipated
1,Too small to do much good. I guess I didn't read the specs good enough. I assumed these were larger like the ones at bed bath and beyond.
1,Slid all around on the  bed and kept falling off. Did 0 to help a toddler be safe on a bed. There is nothing to hold these in place under your sheets, so they slide around until they fall off the bed. I returned after trying for about a week.
1,When it starts to boil, I don't feel safe because the pot literally dances on top of the heat.
1,I recently purchased Amazon Basics baking mats and was extremely happy with them. I went back to purchase more and they were out of stock. I needed more mats and got these instead. They had the worst odor to them the first time I used them, and the second time, and the third time. I noticed that they absorbs odors as well...which does not happen with the Amazon basics mats. These actually absorb the chemical smell from dish washing detergent in the dishwasher. I own a small business and bake gluten free cookies; I need mats that are reliable and will not alter my cookies in any way. These are being returned. I hope amazon basics ones are back in stock because I have orders to fulfill!!
1,While I really like the designs on these coasters (the reason I purchased them in the first place), these are not very durable. They are not wooden like in the title description, so much as cardboard-like, and they let water slide right off them. Do not wet the bottom of the coaster or they will warp. They also stick to every drop of condensation, so be prepared to pick them up if you're drinking a cold glass of water.		On the other hand, they are reasonably thick, so they protect my wooden table well from my hot teacups (sans saucer). And they're pretty enough for compliments. But they don't last.
1,The bags that came with my freshsaver vacuum worked well,  but the valves on these replacement bags leak,  so air gets to the food. I guess they're fine if you're willing to vacuum your food every day or so,  but I am not.
1,Did not fit any of the many bottles I tried.
1,I reallly tried to like this think but it failed whatever I tried to cook. The main problem is heat is not evenly distibuted inside and the result is almost always partially cooked food.
1,This is very narrow pillow case and the zipper broke as soon as I squeezed the pillow in...
1,I got this when my 9speed kitchen aid immersion blender khb100 crapped out and i searched for replacement parts. This one was worse!  The handle kept coming off the shaft while in use!  Soup, dip, smoothies, mayo...all were too much for this cheaper version.  If I had kept  using it, the plastic teeth that grip the drive shaft would have worn off.  I thought it would be better because it didn't have the little grey plastic "seal" inside the blade...the other one had come unsealed and posed a health risk.  I wrote to kitchenaid, and they don't even believe in the longevity of their own products anymore.
1,I was very disappointed with this product.  The first few times I used it, it made great eggs. However about the 5th time I used it the water would no longer fall through to the bottom. It was like the appliance sealed it's self shut. So after the 5th time in use it was just crap. I felt I was ripped off. Great in theory but didn't perform well.
1,It quits working after a year, just an average coffee pot. Do not waste your money.
1,Save your money, this thing will not stay in place even when I added elastic to the back piece and head rest area it slipped everywhere but where it's supposed to be.
1,Rivets in wood handle get very hot when spatula rests on the edge of my griddle. Must hand wash because of wood handles. Just not the right product for me.
1,First of all, the photo was misleading as you cannot remove the strainer to clean it. Then I dropped this shortly after I got it and the filter broke out and the little ball came out. I was still able to use it for a bit, but then the ball just wouldn't stay in place. This is wildly overpriced for the quality.
1,Purchased Dec 2015. Reviewing Oct 3, 2016.  The center elements no longer function.  Just toasts on one side.  Terrible disappointment.  Cannot recommend.  Overpriced and worthless.  It was great for the first 6 months.
1,I should have just spent the extra cash to buy the name brand. This product does not work for the Kitchenaid 6qt stand mixer. Would love to return but my wife threw away the packaging. 100% not happy with this product or the company selling this knockoff product.
1,To anyone who uses this pillow:	How do you sleep at night,knowing that a birds feathers were ripped off for this product? A poor innocent animal had to suffer for your pillow! I lay my head on a cruelty-free pillow,I sleep knowing that no animal had to suffer for my satisfaction
1,Usually great, this box, not so great... lots of sawdust each unit seem to take to long to start, even with the blowtorch I use to start them. Go out if there isn't a great draft. Not impressed with this batch. Burn four cords a year, usually love this product, but after this batch I think fatwood will be my product of choice. Burns hotter, never goes out despite the draft. Starts wood with surface moisture, burns hot, and long to start a fire.
1,Thought this coffee maker would work well in my all electric home. It made coffee two times and quit making coffee. I use it for boiling water now. I guess grandmas old coffee maker was better made then this product. Im disappointed in this product and Im wondering why so many good reviews.
1,this is not a buy... junk
1,Beautiful But Beware! I raised my children with the same set of dishes that we had for years and not one chip or crack. Now that we are older I wanted something with more style. When I saw these, I fell in love.......however, they are beautiful but made horribly. I also do not think they are dishwasher and microwave safe like they claim. I have only had them for a short time and I can't even tell you how many chips and cracks there are. I've even had a cup in my hand and the handle broke right off and the cup fell to the floor. I'm so glad that didn't happen to a guest! I have contacted the company that made them (A FEW TIMES) to find out if I just happened to purchase a couple of bad sets.... And absolutely no response. Amazon is a fantastic company to order from and wish I would have purchased the dishes from them, because they honor their sales but unfortunately I didn't. Oh well, live and learn. My next sets will be coming from Amazon!!!
1,I was SO excited to get this pillowcase. Had a silk pillowcase as a child and loved it. The packaging is very nice, and pillowcase is sealed in plastic. The fabric itself if is very soft, luxurious feeling, truely feels quality. However, the pillowcase was tiny. I immediately jumped on my amazon account to make sure I didn't do something dumb and order a child's pillowcase, but no, I ordered a queen sized pillow case. Larger even than standard size. Measured to be about 20x14 and won't fit any of the feather pillows that I sleep on. I'm just so bummed because the reviews were so positive. I'll be returning and continue my quest for an affordable and quality silk pillowcase.
1,Before you toss your Foodsaver machine
1,MY PANS DID NOT FIT.
1,Just awful in pretty much every respect. Almost impossible to fill with salt/pepper, the reservoirs are absurdly small and worst of all, the motor jams almost evey time you actuate the power button. I wanted to love this...I really did, but it's really just a train wreck.
1,Cheap construction, mine was defective (power button did not work properly) so i returned it. Would not recommend it to anyone.
1,I really loved this grinder, but four months after I bought it the inner plastic piece that is surrounded by the rubber piece you use to turn the grinder began to break. First a small piece broke off, and then more followed. It wasn't dropped and the pieces were breaking off at different areas around the top edge. Now it barely works and I only use it to occasionally grind pink salt.	Bodum produces good products but this is not one of them. They can and should do better.
1,I bought this for my mom and she loves it.  I wish you made a tea set with cups included that would be a great gift item.		*Update: I bought this a while back for my mom and sad to say she never really used it after the first few times.  Apparently the way the spout is designed you can't get a good pour out of it.  Half the tea would end up on the table and the other actually in the cup. I was really excited for her to use it because it took me so long to find something pretty enough and unique, but ended up disappointed that it didn't work properly.  At least it'll look pretty on her shelf, that deserves 2 stars instead of 1.
1,this steamer could/might be dangerous to use.  it's so bad that i'm not even going to try to test it by trying to steam anything in it. I was so excited and couldn't wait for delivery of this steamer, but now I'm extremely disappointed that Cuisinart didn't do a better job of fitting (designing) this steamer to their own cookware!  I put it on my 4-quart saucepan, and it immediately tipped over ... can't have that happening while cooking!! :(  I tried turning it in all directions, and it wobbles and tips no matter what I do ... can't seem to get a good, solid fit.  it would be better with short, "helper handles" on each side (like my old double boiler) for better balance ... not the one long handle, but, even then, it would still be too loose and let steam escape around its sides!  I can't say just how unhappy I really am with Cuisinart for trying to put one over on us with this obviously inferior piece of ... needs to be a tighter fit.  they made a mistake in trying to manufacture a "universal" steamer to fit all their saucepans.  my old copper-bottom double boiler set from 40++ years ago has a much better fit (as it should) ... just wish this one did.  Cuisinart should be ashamed for putting this on the market!  I don't know what more I can say ... would give this zero stars, if I could! :(		before purchasing this steamer from amazon, I even went to Cuisinart's web site and looked up exactly which saucepans this universal steamer should fit, and it should definitely fit the 4-quart Cuisinart multi-clad pro saucepan that I recently purchased from amazon.  I've tried this steamer on all my non cuisinart saucepans, and it wobbles and tips badly on all of them!  really, i'm so unhappy with this purchase that I can't think of the right words to say just how badly I feel without using words that should be censored.  the only surface this pan is stable on is my granite counter top.		now, i'm starting to wonder about the quality of the other Cuisinart pans I recently purchased! :(  so far, they all seem great, and I've been very happy with them, but i'm withholding reviews on those until I've had a chance to use them a little more.		UPDATE (same day):  amazon is graciously refunding the money I spent.  I've even written to Cuisinart about this.  I don't know how something like this made it through their quality control.  judging from other reviews, this steamer just might have a bad defect, but i'm afraid to take a chance and order another one.  i'm going to try to find another good steamer set of some type, but I really did want a matching steamer for my already growing set of multiclad pro cookware.  I would have paid more for a steamer pot that was made especially for my saucepan ... even would have bought another size saucepan with a matching steamer (one that really did fit well).  I hate that some products are being made one size fits all nowadays, not doing justice to anything.  I just need a good steamer by next week when my daughter is visiting ... due to lack of cabinet space, I gave away my old/ancient one when I knew this one was on the way.  maybe I can borrow it back?
1,Small but it will work.
1,This towel wrap has its uses, but it also has some serious limitations.  The format is undeniably convenient.  The print is pretty and the velcro is secure.  I was worried that this might fall apart all the time while wearing, but that's not an issue at all.		The problem is that it's made out of very thin microfiber that's kind of scratchy (you know how thin towels can be).  It's also short.  I am admittedly tall (5'11"), but it doesn't really cover me enough.  If you're really tall, you may want to look for something else.  Also, because this is meant to be a one-size fits all deal, the velcro contracts to really tight (it also stretches quite a bit).  This means it can be quite uncomfortable under the arms if it contracts too much.  Overall, while I like the idea of the product, this one didn't work for me.
1,Temp is off by 12 to 20 seconds
1,Why on earth do they only sew one side of the pillow case opening closed. Now I have to iron the other side of the darn pillow case to keep the opening flat or learn to sew! How did they ever sell this to me...oh yeah that's right the price was so low I just had to buy it. Idiot!!
1,When it worked, it was good, although the soap would get clogged quite frequently.  But the top is plastic and the plastic snaps very easily, rendering it a useless piece of junk!
1,I love the quality of these grinders. The adjustments for the size of the grind is spot on. My problem is with the refill. I can't get the twist tops undone! I know the "righty-tighty lefty; loose-y" chant, however, on a round container, it is impossible to tell whether you are turning right or left to refill the cylinders. A direction arrow would have been most helpful. In addition, it is very hard to get a firm grip on the little handles that you need to open the refill lid.  As it turns out, I am going to have to throw these otherwise wonderful grinders in the trash because without a salt and pepper refill option, they are useless.
1,Looks cheap and discolored. Not work the cost.
1,The handle edges are squared-off and too sharp, digging into the sides of your fingers when holding.  Most wooden spoons are more comfortable as the handles are either round or have milled, rounded-over edges for a softer feel.
1,at first I love it but my sink got a small rust mark so I had to stop using it.  maybe you just have to make sure it's put on a dry surface.
1,This doesnt really cook the bacon thoroughly. The first time we use it, we put about 10 bacon, it took about 10-15 minutes for the bacon to be cooked, the bacon was like chewy and even if we tried cooking it again for few minutes it didn't turn out crispy, not like using the old bacon flat tray we have before, that took only 3 to 4 minutes to cook bacon in the microwave and it will turn out crispy.	So this product is quite disappointment.
1,Wouldn't buy again. It is simply the mattress topper- no cover which makes this seem overpriced. Slides around atop mattress, very annoying to remake bed multiple times per week. It's softer but any mattress foam would be.
1,These are way different than what I received.		They're not rounded in the back and about 1-1/2 inch too small on height and length.
1,Towels are very large and soft, this is good.  They came with some small round stickers on them and when I pulled them off, they unraveled the underlying threads.  I've washed them once and so far they've done okay.		What I don't like are the wash cloths.  They are so soft to the extent that they lack effectiveness when trying to clean underarms, for example, where you've got deodorant and sweat and want to be able to feel squeaky clean.  These wash cloths are so soft that they lack the needed texture.  Poor design.		I'll keep these, will likely use the washcloths as dust cloths, but I won't be ordering another set.
1,I usually like Oxo products, but these have a serious design flaw that makes them unusable. the cap where you fill the grinder comes loose and spills pepper or salt. in the 5 months i've had this item, the bottoms opened up 4 times, 3 times on the pepper and once on the salt. twice it ruined the plate of food.		so, these are going in the garbage, and i'm ordering WMF grinders from Germany, which were my previous ones that lasted ten years.
1,Hasn't been a year yet and the zipper broke already on both of them!
1,We had this blanket since the end of December. I paid nearly $60 and was expecting to have it last quite a bit longer than it did.  It seemed to work well until about the end of January, so for about a month.  Now, it heats up ever so slightly.  It has 2 heat controls on it.  They never worked.  For the first month the blanket was super hot, even when we turned it down to the lowest setting, it was super hot.  Now we don't have to worry about that, because it barely produces any heat at all.
1,the wrong one came in but I just kept it
1,Wow! I expected this to be off one or 2, at the most maybe 10. My oven was set at 500. It had been it 500 for 45 minutes and the thermometer never went above 420. Returning.
1,These are the worst pillows I've ever seen! They are very thin and flat, and the filling does not even fill the entire pillow. They don't look anything like the picture on Amazon. These are going back!
1,hard as a rock. I don't sleep on it I just use it to prop up my other pillows.
1,but they don't bend! I can't grip the pan. They will go to the bottom of the drawer
1,would not even hold wet wash cloth
1,Kind of gross.. came with some hairs glued with the Perl not very appetizing if you ask me..
1,Worked perfect for a year and a half(only ran for 1 summer) and then got the EC code	Now it don't work and I'm out a little less then 200	I will not buy this brand again	Not a happy camper
1,I bought this tray because my other trays ice cubes were too big to fit in my water bottle. These cubes are the "standard" size cubes.		Update.	  These cubes leave a "plastic" taste in my water.
1,The plastic is too flimsy.  The two halves to do not seat well together.  They do not fit snugly together.  I have to put some even weight on top of them so that they seal together better.  Since there is not a solid seal between them water spreads between the individual half sphere openings causing a thin layer of ice connecting the spheres together.  These are not easy enough to prep for me to use them regularly.
1,I loved this product for a long time, however it eventually stopped working. Maybe a calcium build up? I'm not sure, but I was not longer able to make espresso after awhile. Boo.
1,I don't know if I received a different batch than many of the other reviewers here, but the lemons I received are far too neon yellow to look real.  I was very disappointed in the coloring. The quality of the product seems good, but they are not terribly realistic looking due to the coloring.  Also, it took 6 weeks to receive them.  I nearly forgot I had even ordered them.
1,I was able to use these only once and they were unusable after first use.  I don't need a product like this.
1,The arm rests have torn on both arms...wish I could find a way to fix them. Right now I have black electrical tape wrapped around the leather on both arms. The lever to raise the chair  up and down no longer works. Disapointing at best
1,This blanket quit heating the top half after 6 months.
1,The idea of this is great, it uses less soap over time than an ordinary soap pump, but it won't stand the test of time.  I purchased 3 about 3 or 4 years ago, and I now have just one that still functions, and from some of the reviews I've seen, I'm lucky that the one has lasted this long. The silver paint started to wear off pretty quickly, within a few months.  They still worked though, until one started to stick, cleaning it didn't make a difference.  Then another stopped making foam, and started leaking the soap and water solution, making a mess...once again, taking it apart and cleaning it has not helped.  The one that is still functional has not been used as much as the other two.  Don't expect these to last.
1,The Negatives:	1) The inner burr is not cleaned well out of the factory. There were considerable shards of metal bits that needed to be scraped off with a brush. Note, it is highly unlikely to make it into your coffee since most methods of making coffee would filter these out. However given the supposed quality of this product, I would expect a bit more effort. (-1, not cool)		2) The inner burr does not sit in place consistently after removals when cleaning. Whenever the inner burr is removed, the coarseness setting always needs to be changed to something slightly different. Making it an annoyance to clean and write down grind settings.		3) The manual implies that out of the box the grinder should allow for a nice range of grind settings, as one would expect. However on the smaller end, for espresso grinds, it never reached a size that would allow use with a Capresso EC Pro's bottomless porta-filter. I had to make use of the shims it came with to get it down to a grind size that finally worked.		4) Very Loud		Update:	After some use it seems there are nooks and crannies where the coffee gets stuck and is very difficult to remove, so if your burr head doesn't adjust all the way to the left, thats the cause. Just use a toothpick to clean it. As most people mention the head is very inconsistent when you turn up the grind size.		Otherwise, not too bad for the price. There are definitely better options so keep looking!		Update:	It is now just terrible as any remnants of grind consistency has vanished. Dont buy this.
1,The floor mat does not fit around a normal size toilet. Would not buy again. Also, very thin.
1,I wish I could give this purchase and the company involved a minus 1. I received my package today (with other purchases). The stopper was in a package just as it would be purchased in a store. I didn't think about how easy it was to pull back the hard plastic cover open on the backing until I pulled the stopper out. Then it became clear. I had a filthy, used plastic stopper that had been in someone else's bathtub. I have never been so disgusted in my life. And it had been put into a package as if it were a new stopper. And, in case there is a question, yes, my order does say: "condition new."		It was only $6, but that's not the point. I washed it with  soap and water; now I have it soaking in Pine Sol. If you're wondering why I didn't just send it back, it didn't cost enough to be worth my while. Also, once years ago, I bought a bra at Walmart and was horrified when I got home and found someone's dirty, used bra in my package. Someone had done a little switch and gotten a free bra at the store. In any case, I called immediately and took the item back right then, but I still had to deal with the manager's obvious suspicion that I was the one who switched the items out and now was getting the free item. So,no, a $6 item I would have to prepare and send back is not worth it.		Why didn't I just trash it? Because I paid for it, darn it all, and I need it. So, back to the rubber stopper. As I said I'm soaking it in a disinfectant now. There are, of course, the usual scuff marks on the bottom that one gets on rubber items once they are used for a time.		Just disgusted and will not ever buy a product with this on the listing, "Sold by Deerso".		How does the item work? I don't have a clue yet. I'm still trying to get the bathtub scuz from the last owner soaked off.		EDIT: It's only fair to tell you that I did contact Amazon customer service and they are refunding my money on this product.
1,Going to return it to Amazon.  Does not cut pizza.  Not sharp at all.
1,Save up your money for something else. I bought this for a topper on my futon mattress that I have for guests. It arrived smelling so horrid. Which being a foam anything, that is typical. But this smell stuck around for almost three days. How it was packaged it didn't even lay down right. It was lumpy. And it still doesn't lay down right. Also the 1.5 inch was a bunch of bologna. It was more half an inch. I gambled on it, and I lost.  I ended up buying another topper which was so much better. So I would just save up an extra $30-$40 and get something else.
1,Does not look at all like the picture, otherwise will keep water off the floor. Very disappointed in this product, the picture is so blurred as to be almost indistinguishable.
1,Great if you want to workout.  Be prepared to turn that handle A LOT to grind anything.
1,This didn't quite fit in my car. I have a Mazda CX9 and the angle of the electrical input doesn't work. I can't get this totally upright and therefore it's not working as well. I would not buy again.
1,How useful is a broiler pan that warps under the broiler? Can it even legitimately be labeled as a broiler pan if it can't handle broiler heat? These are not just philosophical questions, this item warped dramatically with a steak on it that cost almost as much as it did, one end of which became a great deal more done than the other. While you might think this tragic outcome is disappointing enough, salt was rubbed into the wound: the warp is permanent, although not as pronounced as during cooking. I suppose the pan didn't melt, so I will give it a couple of stars for that.
1,max flow my butt.  no flow more like it and no quality.  don't buy
1,Way too tiny. Don't even think of trying to use these for pegs and jokers.
1,If you're using this for coffee, don't waste your money. Save up for a Lido or Baratza. I even tried the adapter kit to stabilize the shaft, and it's just not worth it.		I do use it for dried herbs now, but that's not why I bought it.
1,The good: It did warm up.	The rest: The reason why I'm returning it is the Teflon on the griddle side was damaged and missing a chunk of the protective coating, meaning things would stick when cooking. on the QC side, there were a couple of beads of glue loose inside of the machine which started smoking when I plugged it in. I selected this one because it had better reviews than the Black & Decker but I guess I chose wrong.
1,These sheets tear pretty easily.
1,I went through 3 of these in less than 2 years.  The second one I had to use the 'replacement out-of-warranty" program and got it for $99 + shipping.  It lasted 2 months.  The third one was a 'free' (I had to pay the shipping for the broken one) replacement for the second in Nov. '06.  In June of '07 the third died and iRobot said it was off-warranty although when I bought the 2nd in 9/06, I was to have a full one-year warranty.  When I refused to spend any more money on one, the guy at iRobot told me to just throw it away (incl. charging base, wall sensors, and remote).  Instead I shipped the whole kit and caboodle (at my cost) to iRobot.  By the way, in all cases the		brushes ceased rotating.
1,Worthless. Nice looking hooks, good sized. But will not stick to tile at all. Choose something else.
1,Not near as good of a pillow as Cloud 9 brand.
1,I own 2 of the original Keurig machines, both always without a problem.  This new machine, however, is not a great upgrade.	I was also surprised, as many others note, about not being able to use certain K cups in the machine, and that the refillable ones that I have will not work (at least not without some silly taping the DRM onto the reusable ones).  But I get it, HP does the same kind of thing with their ink.. they make more on that then they do the printers, right?)		I do like the larger carafe size for some uses.		The bigger problem I am having is with the water temp.  It comes out at 160 instead of 192 as advertised.  I called Keurig since the coffee came out weaker and warmer than it should.  I was told my thermometer is probably not very good.  And I was told that it might do better if I used paper or styrofoam cups (because I guess Denby stoneware is just like a heat sink).		Unhappy with those responses, I have a replacement on the way.  Crossing my fingers but I have seen a lot of similar complaints in these and other web site reviews about the water temp.		**Update 0628/2015***  Received the replacement machine, that really shows little improvement in water temp, maybe three degrees hotter.  Both machines produce a good hot cup of coffee if you let it run it's hot water setting once before making your K Cup... I'm sure that's not the way they wanted it to work.
1,Overpriced for the workmanship. The plastic trays are kind of flimsy. I'm just dreading the day, the weight of a saucepan, adjusting under a load of dishes, slips and breaks off one of the plastic arms designed to hold cups.		I tossed the tray after a couple days and replaced it with a stainless steel MarthaStewart tray I already had. The white plastic shows every drip and stray coffee ground yet doesn't doesnt slide out smoothly for a daily rinsing without the plastic cubbies popping off and collapsing the rack.
1,I ordered them in black......received something that looks more like mahogany, though it was packaged in a box labeled "black." Going to sand them down and stain them myself.
1,This pressure cooker has all kinds of problems.  The recipe book gives one time for a roast (25 minutes) and the manual gives another (35-40 minutes).  The recipe book says set the time for 25 minutes but you only get a choice of 15 or 40 minutes.  The steam valve when opened exits with such pressure that it burns you even if you are wearing gloves.  If  you try to use a tool, the valve surface is completely smooth and difficult to grip.  If you do get it open, the valve sits loosely on it's resting spot so it migrates to the off position over and over so you have to keep opening it.  When you're done with all this the meat is tough.  The bottom of the pan has a rough surface that is very difficult to clean.  Don't buy it!
1,This couch it okay.... it is definitely worth the money your paying. its a cheap couch so don't expect high end quality and then complain when you receive this card board/center block/concrete/road side like couch if so head on over to Z galleries and spend some money. Now it 100% smaller than I thought. A little dinky and flimsy but she's strong. She's cute back cushions are soft, any thing u spill tends to not stain but the seat cushions...I mean its hard like a rock but not in the most terrible way.  you find comfort and if your thinking well good cause eventually wear and tear with soften it..think again she will win the fight.
1,BULLETIN - UPDATE WED MAY 18 - Toaster deader than a hammer. I'd been thinking in recent weeks - after getting my original purchase replaced on warranty - that my Breville was a fine toaster, even with some uneven toasting on dark setting. All the other functions - defrosting frozen bread and toasting it in one cycle - have been a lot of fun. Tonight I put a regular piece of unfrozen bread in, set on med-high and the piece of toast began going up and down and up and down. All the lights across the top began flashing. I unplugged the toaster and tried again, several times. Same result. I paid $159 I recall, for a toaster that lasted less than three months. In total, TWO models of this toaster lasted less than three months.		OLD REVIEW: I'm hoping like crazy that I will consider this toaster a 5-star purchase a month, a year and 10 years from now. Like everyone else I am banking on the relatively low percentage of 1-star and 2-star reviews and very high percentage of 5-star and 4-star reviews. So far my observations are this: It's slow, but I think that's part of a high-quality process. I make toast on the darkest setting, using Trader Joe's multi-grain bread, right out of freezer, and without using the extra toasting button I get uniformly dark, perfect, one-slice servings on both sides. I'm scrambling eggs and making coffee so it's not like I've found myself waiting, drumming my fingers on the counter, for the toast to pop up. I love the buttons - on top of unit and easy to read and making a beautiful display. To one other reviewer's point on a Cuisanart toaster that smudges so easily, I found the same to be true, and of course, it didn't toast evenly, so that went back after 24 hours. On the Breville, the non-smudge finish is just spectacular, like the finish on a Rolls Royce. There's the line we Amazon buyers have found to be so true: you have to see this in person to believe how handsome an item it is. It's like the fit and finish on a $60,000 car, just gorgeous, reeking of quality. *Back to function: the opposite of the dark setting on my toaster is the lowest setting, for just lightly searing hamburger buns. I like Pepperidge Farm "slider" buns, which I freeze and then remove from the freezer as needed, long enough at room temperature to be able to separate the halves and still keep as once piece. That one bun piece, opened, fits into the slot and on the settings of 1 FROZEN and 2 lightest toast setting, the results are perfect, just enough toasting to seal the bread from the burger's juice. I also like the "Lift & Look" and "A Bit More" buttons, but have not explored them much. Bottom line: If this toaster holds up it will be one of the most fun purchases I've made for my 2nd favorite room in the house, my kitchen. Update photo: I added fourth photo to show the beautiful, functional louvers on the one side of the unit. The toaster does generate a lot of heat - not so much greater heat than other toasters but heat that's on for a longer period of time. I may put tinfoil on the underside of the cupboard above the toaster.
1,Not the color the picture
1,DON'T BUY A BLENDTEC! Mine is supposed to have an 8 year warranty, it broke and blendtec won't replace it because I don't have a receipt from 8 years ago. It was a gift, so of course I don't have a receipt.
1,.....since they only burn half way down.
1,Arrived broken..balls floating around in box. Company keeps hounding to "rate their product", so yeah..here it is. Cheap and defective. Don't let them sit in hit water doing dishes, the two piece (glued) will caused the whisk handle to separate from the tines from the glue getting to warmed.
1,Horrible
1,Ok
1,Opened the packed and saw blood stains. Im not sure if it was a accident during  manufacturing  of if these are used sheets.  Price is really cheap, Im gonna wash and see if stains wash out.
1,Do not buy these!! Or even buy anything from this seller for that matter. Buying these shades has been the worst experience Ive ever had on Amazon. I tried contacting the seller... no response. I tried contacting Amazon and was essentially told sorry they cant help me. So not only am I stuck with three broken shades hanging in my windows, the seller won't reply and Amazon customer service basically told me to get lost. Its been an amazing experience. Let me tell you. Ive been a long time Amazon customer. And this is seriously making me rethink my Amazon purchases.		Previous review: They are super crooked and look a little ghetto. But if you just don't pay attention to how crooked they hang, then they are ok. It looks like the cords inside the shades aren't being measured and installed at the correct length. So its causing them to hang all jankety.	Update: after a short time of gentle use, two shades have completely broken. And the third shade is even more crooked. These are absolutely horrible.
1,Love the rack. But wish it came with spices or a subscription to purchase the spices.
1,This barely fits although it says deep pocket
1,It worked great for the first two uses, but the 3rd time I tried to use it, the readings suddenly jumped from 150F up to 250F, and now it reads 160F when the probe is at room temperature.
1,Bottom was not water prof and battery's keep shorting out
1,These bags are very poor in quality.  I bought them because I am about to move and I want to conserve as much space as possible. I should have spent the extra money to get better quality and less bags.
1,I loved this clock and started to really rely on it...until it broke 3 months after I got it. Everything was fine, it actually didn't take that many dives off the nightstand, I generally got to it because of the beeping sounds. In 3 months, it went off the nightstand (3 ft off the ground) about a total of 5 or 6 times, tops. Mostly just rolled around on top of nightstand.		I've been trying to contact the company's customer service since 30 days had passed, and after 4 emails and 2 phone calls I haven't been able to reach ANYONE. This sucks, don't get this item if you expect it work after a few months...
1,I recieved it damaged. Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for!
1,The coffeemaker works fine but the pot is awkward to use. It's insulated and not "see-into", so you can't see the cup-measurement to help with pouring water into the machine. Keep your old glass one!!  It's very awkward to clean. And the insulation is only average, so I end up microwaving last cups to heat them up. I will be sure to go back to the glass pot after this.
1,We got this 10" Norpro Springform pan for our wedding, and I've used it about 5 times since to make German Apfelkuchen (apple cake with a custard type filling), and a variety of other cakes. I had not issues with leaking - the trick is to give the crust a tiny 'lip' that goes up along the edge a quarter of an inch of so higher than the rest of the crust. I was very happy with it, and the glass bottom is so easy to clean and looks nice when you are serving up the cake.	We ALWAYS wash the metal part by hand. Yesterday when I was washing it, the non-stick coating peeled off in my hand, in long 2-3" pieces. I am so disappointed!	I would have given it 4 stars up until yesterday. However, only getting 5-6 uses out of a baking pan just doesn't seem to make sense.
1,Lasted a WHOLE MONTH before the switch broke and stuck on.  Now that is a pretty sight, milk flying all over the place because you cannot turn it off when taking it from the cup.
1,One pf the wheels did,not go on. Had to ridget
1,Plastic bottom is uneven to screw on, and upon putting in liquid first as recommended, will leak. Even after blending it leaks.  Not sure about seals, although put it altogether per instruction provided.
1,This product was awful.  I love their indoor grills so I thought I'd try this and then teflon came off after the 2nd time I used it.  Everything sticks to it and I wasn't even scrubbing but I guess since the food stuck to it so hard it took off the teflon with it.  Would not recommend this!
1,The product we received does not match the images posted.  The images show many vibrant colors.  Our was only two very dull colors that are barely visible.
1,This product does not stick to my bathtub wall at all. I bought this to place just above a small "ledge" in my bathtub where soap is supposed to go, but where no ridges exist to keep the soap from sliding off the ledge. Even with the ledge to help support the weight of the soap, the suction cups will not stay attached to the wall. I ended up removing the suction cups and just using it as a regular soap dish.
1,Situated either direction the flap facing inside my particular sofa is too long and I couldn't tuck it into the cushion.
1,These cups DO NOT hold the temperature of what you put in them.  I've used the stainless for a long time, and they are the best travel mugs available.  These insulated mugs are awful.......if you're looking for travel mugs, get the stainless
1,Read the other reviews, this is not for the newer 14 cup units. Boo on Cuisinart for not making this clearer. So back it went.
1,The loops are too small for most scarfs.
1,the pan is cheap looking...and feels cheap...I bought the heavy metal one insted....1
1,I was very excited about receiving my item. WOW! I could not believe that Skyline Furniture would sell anything like this.  Staples were EVERYWHERE! Tears and rips in the fabric where the screws were located, which would lead up to a "SOFA GONE WORST THAN IT WAS WHEN RECEIVED!" The back of the back rest had a piece of cardboard as thin as a shoe box sitting in the middle.  The cardboard was sitting in the middle, not covering the entire back, but in the MIDDLE.  WHY? Not to mention the back was closed with VELCROW. The fabric in the back was loose where the fabric was wrinkled.  What a let down!  The only good thing about it was that the AMAZON representative was very helpful and I am getting my money back. I think the AMAZON representative felt bad because he could hear the disappointment in my voice.  I was really looking forward to this item and it would have really looked great in my home. If you want this item, I recommend that you print out the picture and hang it on your wall because the real item is a JOKE!
1,I hate giving a negative review, but it may help you to know that this blanket is weird. I've had many electric blankets and they acted like blankets. You put them on yourself and they stay there. The wires are in the blanket but it's still a blanket. Here, the blanket is constructed like a double blanket, with wires in the middle, so when you have it on you the top blanket shifts and the lower blanket doesn't and it is generally just a messy experience - and worse when you try to fold it up, as many electric blankets other than this one do nicely enough. So, not my favorite, and after a winter trying to manage it, I threw it away this past weekend.
1,Have written 3 reviews of this product.  Pretty colors.  POOR quality.  As I have said, what would I expect from such a low price. I would not advise buying these.  Quality of waxed paper.
1,Pro - Design is good. Color is good		Cons - Finishing is very bad. Lot of sharp wooden splinters are coming out. I had few in my hand. The most annoying issue is the finishing near the handle area are the one that are very bad. We trend to move or lift using the handle and end up with wooden splinters struck in hand.		For the price we could have got a better product.
1,This model requires you to hold down a button on the top and hold the speed button on the front. Impossible to operate with just one hand so you can't hold your bowl or pot while you blend, not a fan.
1,Had to return had a hole in the toe area.
1,Quality was not good. I realize they are children's sheets,  but I got a different set at Walmart and their quality was better and less expensive.
1,I am sorry to say that though the color was wonderful, there is just no body to the material. I was very disappointed and was immediately going to return it. However, one of my helpers loved it, so I gave it to her. She seemed very pleased. However, I could not recommend this product to anyone who is looking for "body" in their Duvet Cover.
1,Too small, too hard, made pain worse
1,Left greens wet... No thanks, sent it back...
1,They changed the name from a "whole" house fan, which it is clearly not..You can buy a more powerful fan at the Dollar General,,,FACT!
1,The colors are different than shown, and the subtle coloring was why I was ordering this set to begin with. Completely different, and I feel defrauded. Not worth it to return them, but every time I see/use them, I'm going to be reminded of how they were supposed to be -- and aren't. I was going to order the matching measuring cups, but I won't, now.
1,Fairly nice while it worked - only 2 months until the pepper mil started free-wheeling.
1,Not worth it.  Takes forever to get to the actual meat temperature.
1,I thought I was getting four frames and I got one that is broken.
1,I purchased this item last fall and was initially very happy with it. It was just the right size for utensils and it was beautiful. I did not mind paying a little higher price for it because I believed it to be a quality item. I  handled it very gently and it was never placed in a dishwasher. After using this crock for about one month I had to pack it away while we were remodeling the kitchen.  It was repacked in it's original packaging, including styrofoam, and there was not a mark on it. However when I unpacked it there was a chip on it, marring the beautiful aqua color. I was surprised that the color was just a skin and did not go clear thru the item, and it was so easily damaged no matter how well I packed it. Needless to say I am not pleased and am waiting to see if the other crocks I purchased will peel as well. I would encourage readers to beware of purchasing this pottery if they intend to use it for anything other than a vase of sorts.  I definitely would not purchase this item or brand again, nor would I recommend it to others however beautiful it may be~
1,Description deceiving and false advertising!		Item Title says "Pack of 2".	Description just below that says "Set of 10".	Then the Product Description below that says "***(This item sold as a pack of 12)***"	I only received 2 liners.  Not what I was expecting.  I will be returning them.
1,My mother, in her 80's, wanted a lite weight steamer. She settled on this. Before she could try it out dad threw out the water container not realizing what it was. I contacted the company and though they don't replace the containers they would replace the steamer if I sent them the cord off the first one. I did and I received another steamer. I was totally impressed they would do this for me. I have always sent my husband's dress shirts to the cleaners for ironing. He's retired and who cares about dress shirts now? I decided to steam them. This is when I discovered the steamer has 2 little holes for the steam. It didn't even begin to take wrinkles out. In fact the steam really didn't feel all that hot. I decided to pack it up and give it to Goodwill since it's brand new. Then I found that the water container doesn't really want to empty and I don't like water to sit in these kinds of appliances. I ended up sticking paper towel in the little opening to soak up the excess water. Conair you get one star!
1,After half year gentle use all have holes
1,Terrible quality. One of them broke quickly. Returned them almost immediately. I wouldn't buy them. I went to Whole Foods and bought a quality ceramic one in stead.
1,Arrived broken and I waited too long to return.
1,This is the loudest blower I have purchased.  I bought this to replace a quadra-fire wood stove blower with a bad bearing.  The whine from this blower motor may be more piercing than the irritating rattle from the old worn out blower.  Next time, I will spend a few dollars more for a blower that at least claims quiet running.
1,Thin
1,Really, really small!
1,Pills after washed. I wouldn't purchase again.
1,I bought this mattress protector when we had our daughter to protect our mattress from any messes. Well, we haven't had an issue keeping spills from our bed until today. She was napping on our bed and peed. I pulled the blankets, sheets and mattress pad off right away and our bed was wet underneath. So frustrating to pay so much and have them say there's a 15 year warranty only to have the product not even work.
1,was loving this thing until recently when it can't stay on at warm so now we can only set it at off or boiling which means we can't slow cook. had it since august 2016 and it started happening at november 2016...
1,I received this Decen French press and immediately noticed at the lid is approximately 1/8" to small for the press. The lid just rattles back and forth and makes the press feel cheap. Gonna send it back for a different manufacturer.
1,I had great expectations for this clock, but it's didn't work well, and I felt the quality wasn't good.		It's basically a digital clock with very few features. I liked that it was supposed to sync by Bluetooth to my iPad, but I never got this to work. It's made out of a cheap looking clear plastic. The built in sounds are loud and annoying.		The wakeup light feature is nice, I guess, but not enough to warrant a buy for me.
1,Does not work
1,It's cute and looked great in my room but it doesn't melt very good. I had it on high setting and it took hours to just warm up the wax tart. I threw it away..
1,2 years later and the legs have bent inwards. I don't move it at all and it's only me on this frame. The plastic feet keep falling off and have ruined my floors. The slats are nice and sturdy (hence the 2 stars), but the legs do not hold the bed in place and their structural integrity is abominable.
1,eventually the one star's will take over the popularity. Don't know for sure is that the design changed or not but my filter only lasted 5 days and at $20 for a 4 pack that won't be happening too many times more. Plus I use this to stop UTI's from happening. Well that's not the case anymore.
1,I guess I failed to read that this is cheap plastic. The picture is deceptive as it portrays as copper. Definitely not worth more than one dollar at a dollar store.
1,These did not fit our standard Queen bed frame.
1,I love OXO products, so I was bummed that this didn't work as well as their other products. The shelf looks sturdy, but I don't think it's good for a wet environment like the shower. Mine stuck for two days and then fell with a crash.  I put it back up after it dried and put a couple of items on it, rather than three.  Not very useful.
1,I was a little wary when I saw so many reviews saying that their lotus broke down. However, I liked the concept so much I thought I would roll the dice. Sure enough, MINE BROKE TOO!		The company sent me a new one and so far after three uses it is still alive. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
1,This comforter is only about 1/3 as thick and fluffy as it looks in the  photo. If you're shopping for a blanket, this might do.
1,bad fit
1,Nope. Nope nope nope.		Here's what you need to realize about this mitt - if you hold it absolutely perfectly, grasping onto the hot item with only the silver side, you're fine. IF, however, you're like almost ever other cook in the world and slightly rotate your hand a bit when you take it out, thus having the hot item touching the blue part of the mitt, you feel the heat IMMEDIATELY.		I had such high hopes for these mitts but now? I won't even let my kids use them.
1,Zipper broke after only a month of use.
1,I have had this measureing cup for just under a month. At first is was great!! Now I cant even touch the outside because the black measurment marks smear and disappear. I have never put it in the dishwasher, always hand washed it. I am really bummed because i already got rid of all of my other measuring cups.:(
1,Updated:  RIP.  Sunday, September 4, 2016.  I give up.  It kept getting error messages and refused to charge or acknowledge charging in any way.  It is the wrong shape for a door stop.  It has been moved out to disposal.		Original review:  The little robot who could	What this little robot lacks in finesse, it makes up for with its general over-charged, willing to keep going forever mode.  Its like it has the Energizer Bunny sitting on top of it, drumming,  You can do it, you can do it!		The small opening for the dust collector initially put me off.  This may still be problematic but there are two brushes, one on each side that collect the dirt and direct it into the bin.  While the opening may be smaller, I found that it was as effective as my Roombas.  In normal daily use, my Roomba picked up, on average, an extra 1/8 of a cup of dust and hair when it was run right after the Bissell.  I have 3 large dogs who like to play in the back yard I call a mud puddle, so I run the Roomba pretty much once or twice a day, never less.		The only real flaw I have found is that the first few times I used it, it went around the outside of the room several times and then went base hunting.  It was an odd behavior, to be sure.  But it straightened itself out and decided to do the whole room after that.  This robot freely went into other rooms and readily found its way out.  It backed out when it found it got into a tight space.  It also did not get stuck, which was a huge bonus.		I like this unit and am surprised by how well it works.  I would not have predicted this level of efficiency.
1,Makes great coffee and looks great but it's cheaply made. The letters on the buttons have rubbed off after only a month of use so now I can barely read what the buttons are for haha. It's not funny but I'm laughing to make myself feel better about it -_-		Also, the inability to reheat or keep the warming plate on is really annoying. After the initial heating of the coffee you either drink it right away or find yourself microwaving coffee an hour or two later
1,I love the look of the clock but the center mechanical part doesn't work and I want to replace it for one that does.
1,I did not keep this in the charger 24/7 - just re-charged when needed. After 5 months the battery is useless and even with 24/7 charging it barely opens one bottle of wine. Update - now after 6 months the unit will hold a charge to open 2 bottles of wine plus it will not eject the pulled cork. Moving on to another vendor.
1,This is the worst thing I have ever bought!  It boils over into the microwave leaving most of the water IN the microwave.  I ended up burning myself trying to get it out to drain the pasta.  What a waste of money!<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pasta-N-More-5-Piece-Microwave-Pasta-Cooker-Set-with-Bonus-Cookbook/dp/B0017VIO36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pasta N More 5 Piece Microwave Pasta Cooker Set with Bonus Cookbook</a>
1,As others have experienced, mine eventually lost all sound (radio, ipod, internet radio).  Seems to be a common problem with Denon products, caused by poor manufacturing processes -- bad solder joints on one or more components.  What a shame.  I remember when Denon was a respectable brand, but that time has obviously long since passed.
1,I bought this Hamilton Beach electric kettle because I liked its features and design, along with Hamilton Beach's reputation.		The only minor issue I had with this kettle was that I could not pour out the water very quickly at a certain angle, as it would leak from the sides. It was something that I could live with.		However, Hamilton Beach improved on their product with a wider pot and spout, which pours without leakage.		Anyway, this week, week of Aug 12th, the heater makes a loud whining sound when heating up. So, this alerts me that this heating element is not going to  be operating very long.		I will be taking the newer Hamilton Beach model from the camper and into the house until I can determine what to buy next for the house.		Perhaps, all these electric kettles, no matter what the brand is, don't last more than a year.
1,I don't usually give negative reviews, like ever. I recognize that a couch that costs 150$ isn't going to be extremely comfortable or durable but I gave it a go because it's "Serta" and my other Serta couch (albeit 3x the price) might be the comfiest couch I've ever sat on.		So, why is this a 1 star product? I wanted a pretty basic couch that I didn't look bad and would double for a quick bed if someone came to visit. I only chose this over the Mainstays futon that everyone had in college...because it was the Mainstays futon that everyone had in college. I thought it looked spiffy for my place because it didn't have arm rests and as I live in a modern building and have modern decor, it'd look great. WRONG. Don't bother without arm rests, there's simply no great place to keep your arms! (go figure) It's also a shorter couch, but it's listed as mini so that's not something I would dock it for.		BUT. THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE COUCH I'VE EVER USED. Let me elaborate. If you're sitting on the couch in one of the three "spots" there is no wood supporting it so you sink comfortably and all is well. But if you happen to miss you will sit on one of the wooden supports and it will have ZERO give and your tailbone will get a great little jolt. It's NOT pleasant. Now if you lay down on the couch, you will notice that your side will hurt after use because once again you will dig against the support bars. I've gotten pretty good at laying flat and not on my side so it doesn't dig into my ribs and rather disperses across my back muscles and can now nap on the thing if I have to. But your guest will never want to (my buddy actually slept on the floor). I haven't bothered making it a bed since the first week or so, the crease in the middle is VERY defined and instead of padding, you guessed it, there is a support beam.		Moral of the story? Buy the Mainstays one and spruce up around the couch. This guy is pretty chic looking in jet black, but I'm looking into other couches and making this a permanent chaise because it's just not comfortable unless it's in chaise mode (and that + the looks is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1)
1,Definitely not a mildew free curtain.  I had it 6 months and it has awful mildew on it and it's always rinsed off and dried out.  I've had a different curtain in our other bathroom for at least 5 years now and have never once seen mold on that one - now THAT'S what you call mildew free.  This one tears easily too.  We are not rough with it at all and there's a few small holes in out that just appeared out of nowhere.
1,I wanted a shorter spatula for my small 8 in frying pans. The info said the spatula was 11.8 in. which made me thing it was a smaller than usual spatula. But no. It actually is 13 in long and much bigger than it looks. Doesn't work well for me especially with the angle of the spatula end. Disappointing.
1,Paying nearly 20 bucks for an average glass jar with a plastic lid is dissatisfying to say the least. Add to that the fact this container is hardly "smell proof", by which I mean an individual human with a moderate head cold still picked the container out as containing the offending substance.
1,Too small
1,I always take good care of my electronics and this was just seems too expensive for what it is. I used this product for sleeping and it was pretty quiet while doing its thing. Seemed to be cleaning the air since we have cats but do not let them in the bedroom and gf has a slight allergy. Then it was harder and harder to click on and now a month after buying it I cannot get it to turn on. So it is sitting in the corner collecting dust, trying to figure out what to do with it.
1,i ordered this for my daughter to make a german dish, to avoid rolling dough forever. the first one was missing or had broken items. so i got it replaced, send it all the way to from Texas to California, just for her to tell me it doesn't work either. in the meantime it's back here in texas and i myself can't do anything with it. guess it's trash. gotta read reviews of other ones and try to find a good one. a few dollars more might get a much better item than cheap and not working.
1,The price is the key here. I bought these a month ago and finally got to use them. The bags are a little bit "slipperier" if that makes sense and the roll doesn't fit in the area meant for bags. I knew this prior to purchase.... but it is inconvenient to cut them by hand. I guess I will roll some out so they do fit. I would recommend though without question for the price alone!		*****Updated Review***** These are horrible. Do NOT buy them! Here I am months later and realizing that the cheap imitations don't last. You seal your food. It looks fine/like it worked. And then either weeks or a couple months after you open your freezer to get something out and realize that the vacuum seal did not hold. I resealed at least 10 packages yesterday that I noticed had a gap/room inside. One package actually had freezer burn. So in the long run this item was DEFINITELY NOT worth it!
1,It does not chop frozen fruit well. It is very noisy. After 2 months use and the base leaks. Forget this brand and buy the Magic Bullet instead. That does a much better job and last must longer.
1,usless
1,This is a cheap chinese piece of garbage.  but it was cheap so I can't give it a one.
1,I agree with the other one star people. This is made of very flimsy, cheap plastic. The insert part bends as you are trying to slice with it. The plastic also stains very easily. I would recommend saving your money and buying a good knife. Maybe other mandolines are better. I don't know how this got a recommendation from America's Test Kitchen. I was under the impression that German products were better than most, but definitely not this one.
1,Smaller than picture.  Returned item to amazon.  I would not buy again.
1,I thought this was larger, they are too small.
1,It worked great for about two months and then completely stopped working. I gave it two stars simply because it did arrive on time, and while it worked, it worked well, but I won't be buying it again. Pity because I liked several features like how you could direct the mist, change the settings and how easy it was to fill. But when it doesn't work, those things don't matter much.
1,I've been pressure cooking for quite some time and based on the reviews in Cooks Illustrated and here on Amazon wanted to upgrade size and quality.  I tried using this pressure cooker and could not get it up to pressure.  Everything is fine by all appearances, thanks Amazon members who sent me suggestions on how to fix, but all I can guess is the Euromatic valve will not seat properly containing the steam and forcing up the pressure to full.  I tried 5 times and all I ended up with was a lot of steam but the blue pressure indicator never rose to the first line let alone the second.		I'm glad I had not yet given away my old pressure cooker.  All I can say is big disappointment, products should work out of the box.
1,The color on these candles is only a coating on the outside.  The candles are white on the inside.  They may look nice before you burn them, but once lit they not attractive.
1,Looks beautiful but will hardly open a bottle.  I bought it to replace an old ratty Coca-Cola opener.  The bottle catcher works great and both the opener and the cap catcher look great but I wound up putting the old ratty one back up because the new one would barely open a bottle.  It didn't catch the cap like a normal bottle opener does.  You can eventually open a bottle with several tries.  The old ratty one works perfectly on the first try every time so we are back to using it.
1,First, some of the grooves were NOT lined up which was a pain and made gaps after it was put together. One of the screws didn't even have a groove on it so I ahd to go locate another in my tool box.  The product split in two places before it was completed.  Inside shelves are laminated cardboard.  The magnet catch for the door should have had shorter screws supplied, as a result of the longer screws, one came through the front of the door.  There was a mar in one side panel.  So, all in all, very poor quality.  I'll keep it long enough to make do until I find somehting better (shouldn't be to hard, just about anything outside of a cardboard box would be better.  (I would have returned it but had it half made before the enormity of the fiasco became clear.)
1,Should last more than a year and a half. 1st the timer kept shutting off, so we just started using it manually, and couple days later, no more power, not worth the trouble to send back under warranty, the wife had me order another one, she loves Cuisinart products, told her it's crap and it's made in China, but I love her and I'll just wait for the new one to crap out, I'd rather have a cheap mr.coffee than this.
1,I bought these for my guests to use with cocktails.  Be warned that these are very fragile and do not hold up well when used to pierce food.  Many of them have snapped while being used gently.
1,How can a quality cast iron cookware maker like Lodge peddle such a USELESS & DANGEROUS piece of crap is beyond me. You will burn your hands if you use it. Bought a thermal welders glove instead and cut out the fingers for better and safe handling. Oh Brother
1,Just not what I expected from Ateco.  Just ask easy to use my thin knives and less messy.  Sent it back after one use.
1,First time buying these incense sticks. I was expecting a longer lasting or lingering scent.
1,Pretty color. Wasn't what I expected. Hard plastic. Could get at store for few dollars. Very cheap. I wouldn't recommend.  Another item to  Goodwill
1,The flat sheet is missing,  they look used and the 2 of the pillow cases are different colors!!! I'm over all really upset I even waisted my time to purchase these. I will be buying from somewhere else!
1,My son in VA has the Vacuum and I have the bags.
1,This doesn't fit my 12 quart Cambro tub.  I am returning it.
1,Not worth the money and some came broken so using generic mix ?
1,The metal looked attractive enough, but the plastic View strip was really thin and could easily Bend with very slight pressure.  I don't expect it will last long, with a full container I feel like I could easily crack the plastic.
1,These are TINY!! The bigget one is half the size of the raychel ray set and the smallest one is smaller than my hand! While these look slick and is oven safe to 450 degrees but I plan on meal prepping. This is like a toy set for little boys and girls to use when play tea party
1,We bought this machine in May 2015 based on all the good reviews and it did clean well while it worked.  However, it quit working after using it only 4 or 5 times in 28 months. The company couldn't offer any help for fixing it ourselves; said we needed to ship it back and pay for repairs. Finding a box big enough to pack it in, paying for shipping both ways plus repairs is not acceptable. We realize no company will back up a product for 2 1/2 years, but having a $260 machine break after using 4 or 5 times is not an indication of good quality.  We will certainly never buy another Rug Doctor product again.
1,This is one of the most frustrating Ikea items to assemble. There are literally over a 100 parts in this and if you make a mistake, you have to just start all over again. The straps that hold the slats on are the most frustrating, slow and hard to fit. Getting the slats in also takes a bit of practice and thought. The instructions are not great. The end result is okay, there is a bit of spring in the slats. Will it last? Probably not.
1,I bought a full size fame.  The bed frame description stated the length is 75"...WRONG!  My full size mattress length is 75", but it sticks out a good 6-inches longer than this frame!  Don't buy, unless you want your mattress to stick out.
1,Bought this product yesterday. I was happy since I thought I had found a solution to clean my grout without having to go down on my knees and scrub. I saw some of the reviews with pictures praising this machine, and some of the pictures even had a good before and after picture of dirty and clean grout. I was convinced, this was what I was missing, I had to have it. Well, I was very very disappointed after I cleaned with this. It does literally nothing for my grout, it scrubs the tiles, yes, but my grout is still as dirty as before. I will be returning this product today.
1,I really wanted to like this pan.  Good stainless quality, BUT two BIG negatives:  There are no handles to grip the pan when getting it out hot from the oven.  Very difficult and dangerous, especially if you have a heavier item cooking in it.  The stainless is slick too, so even harder to grip.  Then, the second big problem is the lid is very difficult to get on and off.  It is going back tomorrow.  I really tried to like this.  Nice, deep size.  But, really, add handles and make the lid either slide on and pop on and off easier.  It just isn't safe to get out of the oven without handles on either side to grasp.
1,cheap lookng and too sheer
1,It is very quiet on the low settings but does no filtering at all on those settings. On the highest setting, I THINK it makes a slight difference. It does collect a little dust on the filter but the filters that are supposed to deal with pet odors don't even touch the smell of my upstairs neighbor's cooking.
1,Discretion doesn't underline cover will not fit larger more only for the smaller tilt mixer
1,Looks good but not as heat proof as I thought it would be. Don't think I'd recommend it at all
1,Pure junk.  After the first use, one tray got 3 cracks in it and became useless.  After 3 uses, the second one got 3 cracks in it and now I can't fill the outside 4 cubes on both sides.  Not very useful.  The third tray is holding in there so far.  Really chrap plastic.
1,I didn't purchase this grill from Amazon due to a two for one deal at the Redi Set Go website. Two for $39.95 was a steal but attached was a $29.00 shipping charge. Still $69.80 for two was still a deal.	Shipping was fast two units in one box. One unit had the advertised acessarys and the other unit was a stand alone.	We cooked a rib eye steak first off for 7 minutes adding a little salt and pepper after the meat was done.	The steak was cooked perfect and good with no pink.	Now the draw back and I was waiting for it. The non stick in the thing is peeling and failing fast. Like alot of the infomercials since the inception of non stick teflon 30 or 40 years ago, you wonder where all these scientists, engineers and R and D people went to school.	This is probably my only issue with this Redi Set Go.	I have good non stick cookware in my kitchen and used such for agressive cooking alot of the time.	The difference is my stuff is teflon fused to steel. The non stick on the Redi Set Go is not. It cant be.	Its the old Yoshimira spray on. Thats why even with oil the coating will bubble and start to fail.	So, I know the Redi Sets temp is too hot for the basins non stick coating.	I think the extra tins may prove better cooking results because of a little cooler atmosphere perhaps.	I hope so! As a tip for burnt on stuff, put plain water in the unit and heat then use the spatula to gently remove	non stick! burnt mater. LOL	My oppy? This little cooker is well spent for what you get if you can do a $19.95. Its fast and gonna be fun for the most part. No oven, kitchen cool and easy clean up.	Its a yes here with reserves.	If you want real non stick tough stuff? Buy Cooks products for your kitchen.	Ed Walton
1,Heavy and nice looking. But had to return because clock mechanism was not working at all.
1,Bought this at Bed Bath and Beyond. Horrible machine. I previously had a floor steamer. This doesnt clean the floor very well. Takes multiple passes over and over to get kitchen floor clean. HATE the fact that is has all these components that need "cleaning" after use. Its a filthy dirty machine. I don't wanna touch dirty components to clean more stuff! Then ya hafta buy the liquid and the filter. UGH. Im taking this back tomorrow.
1,No matter how much I worked with it, I could not get it to adhere to the shower wall securely. I cleaned the marble tile wall and the suction cups well before pressing the basket in place. Within a few hours, the basket fell. As other reviewers noted, the smallest of the three suction cups does not align properly, making it only partially effective. I tried twice more, wetting the cups both times, and the basket still failed to stay in place. It's going back.
1,This bag is the size of a tote bag not a purse. Seller is slow to respond to my request to return. I would not recommend this seller at all.
1,Plastic thought they were wood. Could have bought the same frame for much cheaper if I had wanted plastic.
1,The dispenser works fine, and we loved the product. Until it started to leak. At first it wasn't noticeable. Then, after having the product for maybe two months, the slow leak at one of the seams on the bottom of the container turned into a very rapid leak. We were losing about a tablespoon of olive oil an hour. We contacted the AsSeenOnTVGuys regarding a replacement because it was obviously defective and were told no dice because we had purchased the product too long ago. Very disappointing.
1,drawer has issues and missing knobs. Some of the holes had to be drilled out.
1,Update: Glass plate exploded in my cupboard, sending shards of glass all over inside cupboard and with enough force to open door. Barely any pressure on plate, and no heat changes. House is 70 degrees at all time. I googled this product and apparently, this can happen with tempered glass and especially with Duralex. This product appears dangerous. I am hoping seller sees this review and contacts me for return.		i bought an entire set of these dishes, pasta bowl, dinner plates, and desert plates. Yes, the dinner plate is on the small size, but I like smaller size dinner plates. (Large dinner plates are heavy,and often have problems fitting in cupboards,) They are beautiful, fit in cupboards perfectly, clear and shinny. I can put any color underneath--placemats, or chargers--and the clear (crystal) doesn't take away from the food presentation. In fact, the simplicity of the dishes showcases the food. Packaged well, and arrived quickly.		i bought an entire set of these dishes, pasta bowl, dinner plates, and desert plates.

1,Very disappointed.  Must remain upright or will leak.  I suggest that you look at Corningware 22-Oz. Pop-Ins Mug  for a couple more dollars.  Otherwise, prepare to clean-up the leaks.
1,This was difficult to use.  I knew it wouldn't be able to handle large bread or thick fillings but it basically doesn't even work.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I am not sure how they even got the panda facial impressions so dark and obvious for the stock photo because it didn't work no matter what we tried when using it.  I didn't even donate it to charity but threw it away because it's junk.
1,Everything sticks even when using a baking spray
1,Was great and quiet.  died after 4 months
1,bought 2  one broke and both were very cheaply made  can do better for the money
1,You get what you pay for. Accents are cheap, clock is cheaper.
1,I don't bake a lot so have only used this a few times but from the beginning the cord doesn't retract very well. I actually have to hit it for it to retract & even then it is not a solid retract like my old mixer that my husband dropped & it broke. I am going to try it a few more times & if it doesn't shape up, I might return it.... if I can.
1,3 of the 5 screws received with the product were to short. Had to go to hardware store and purchase 3 longer screws. Pain in the butt. Took much to long to assemble the base.
1,I ordered red.  What came is closer to maroon, not red.  Therefore I was quite disappointed.  I will never order this brand again.
1,Made in China. Sent them back.
1,Using them to freeze my fresh raspberries in and they are working out just fine. Very happy with size and quality. NO LONGER TRUE.	***UPDATE*** Now that I have been using them for about two months the plastic tabs on the gray pieces have both broken off rendering freezing impossible. Unfortunately I needed to use them on a daily basis to add fruit in as it ripened and was picked each day. I save the fruit up for the fall when I make jam or sauce.  The gray plastic piece which had two little tabs that needed to be opened/closed to access or close the bag both completely snapped off! The plastic could not withstand the freezing temperatures. Now the bag is completely unusable for freezing anything.  So the silicone bag is quality, but the plastic that literally is the way it is sealed is not.  If you are looking to use these to freeze anything that you need to get into and out of on a regular basis then this is not the product. Just buy heavy duty freezer bags which are way cheaper. Note that I can't speak to any other uses other than freezing. I really hope that the company can find a much better way to seal the bags in the future that will be unbreakable. Hard plastic does not work well with freezing temperatures.
1,Description says "Soft Brushed Microfiber" - - - they are only soft in the sense that they are polyester-ish (they completely look and feel like polyester), and they are somewhat transparent and thin, and they have a sheen/shininess to them - these are not qualities I desire in bed sheets.... very disappointing.  I am returning these sheets.
1,I returned the clock. It is made of inexpensive brittle plastic. If it has a low light sensor I didn't notice. It does have a few second display light by pushing a button.  I had several failed attempts to install the last triple A battery. The compartment was too small. The battery spring was crushed fully and when I tried to set last battery, two would pop out. This happened several times before I could jam in the batteries. I feel this is a manufacturing defect. I would not recommend this product.
1,In spite of using these as stated in the instructions, they broke after just a few uses. There's a seam running down the side of the mugs. After washing each mug in warm soapy water, the seams cracked wide open.		I had completely finished enjoying my cold beer, leaving no trace of ice buildup on the interior of the mugs. As soon as I rinsed them with warm water, I could hear the sides cracking open. The opening ran down the entire length of the mugs and into the outer surface of the interior wall. Needless to say, both mugs have since been disposed of.		It would appear that the only way to wash these, would be to wait until they returned to room temperature. The warm water causes too drastic a temperature change against the cold surface, thus resulting in their cracking.		I had great promise for these freezer mugs. The few beers that I was able to enjoy, were icy cold to the last sip. Too bad that the material used to manufacture them is so fragile.
1,My best friend bought this pan at a church sale for 25 cents and gave it to me.  It still had a $60 sticker on the back.  Very good weight and size and makes a great tray to carry foods from kitchen to grill because of the great handles.  Unfortunately, even though it's been used very little, it has scratches or rust marks on the bottom of the pan.  You would be better off to spend the money and get a Calphalon or All Clad, something you won't be sorry for.
1,Loved these but one had a crack on the inside when I open the package. I notified the shipper and was refunded quickly. Inspect before you give as a gift. But product is cool none the less.
1,it picks up hair(human) and fluff from the carpet& rugs. I turn it off and the dirt falls out.  Even when clean the tube that carries the fluff . it still didn't perform
1,Pros:		PTFE & PFOA free	All Natural		Cons:	Not as not stick as other non-sticks		I also bought a ScanPAn frying pan that is very non-stick, more than this one, but still employs PTFE, ugh. With that one, I didn't even need to use a spatula, a small shake released the egg I was frying, flip, cook other side, slide onto plate. Thomas' english muffin with taylor ham and a fried egg. Yay for breakfast.  With this one, I still needed to pull out the spatula to gently scrape it off, though no traces of egg was left on it.  It is also harder to clean.  With the other pan, the instructions say to add cold water once done cooking to use the steam to loosen debris and then just rub with a sponge.  It is really that simple without any warping.  The Cuisinart still had some issue getting it clean after cooking a piece of meat on it.  I don't use heat higher than medium.  It is cheaper though than the scanpan which is why I got theirs in 8" and this one in 10".  If scan pan's 12" were cheaper I'd get theirs, but I'll settle for this brands due to pricing.		Edited:		I had to come back and edit it after more time using it.  It is horrible, beyond belief.  The first time was acceptable and I fried an egg sans oil.  I've cooked using oil and is still sticks. I need to let food soak with water after cooking just to get to clean it.  I'm going to but PAM to use with this pan, though it should not need it.  Most non-stick manufacturers will even tell you that it is not recommended as it impedes the not-stick surface from doing it's job, but in this case, it already isn't.  I don't heat it past medium, I don'y use abrasives to clean it, and I've cared for it like a baby.  Scanpan's stainless steel is so much better, too bad I got an 8" for it, gotta save for the 12" I guess.  A well treated cast iron skillet works better than this garbage.
1,The picture & description of the "Chicago Cutlery Insignia2 12-Piece Block Knife Set" don't reveal that the set comes with two empty slots in the Knife Block  (i.e., it's two knives short of full).  I consider this an undisclosed drawback if you are giving it as a gift.  I was also disappointed to see "made in China" on the box, making it unsuitable (to me) as a gift item.		Update:  After some time had passed since I wrote this review, about 60 "not helpful" responses to my review SUDDENLY appeared.  Could the source be the merchandising department of Chicago Cutlery?  Who knows?
1,I bought these to use with my Christmas manger scene, but they are not very bright and the battery didn't seem to last too long.
1,This product is supposed to keep a rug in place.  The rug in question is right next to my bed, this pad does NOT keep the rug in place, it still slips all over the place when I get up in the morning.  NOT happy with it at all.
1,They do not keep heat out, they are warm to the touch, I can feel the heat comin off it and room is warmer now than when I had vertical blinds up. They are not thick and although mine are black they still let light in through the curtain.
1,Although the price was great, I definitely got what I paid for. These batteries last about 2 days in fairy lights. They are a very poor buy and a very poor product. Buy name brand batteries! Don't waste your money.
1,I was not expecting this steamer to squirt boiling water not only on your hands but on your delicate fabrics. What a shame. I would be a cool to keep this steamer around because I would be subjecting myself to get burned. Also it will steam one item before the water gets low. So you are constantly refilling. Not good with heavier fabrics or deeply wrinkled ones. If it did not spit fire I would have just kept it around for all my lighter materials.
1,The product arrived with 2 big dents on the sides
1,This water bottle has a weird smell to it, this is even after I washed it out.  I'm getting ready to return it.
1,Cheap quality, when I took out of the plastic bag the chrome paint was already peeling off.
1,No matter how you fill it, it will stop spraying propely. Dribbles or a solid stream don't cut it. May work 1 put of 5 times.
1,I give this one star extra merely because it's cute and it IS an nice owl shaped spoon rest. The problem is that it doesn't work. It's only job is be able to rest spoons on it. Wish we'd read some other reviews more carefully. Just discovered the same thing others did - the shape is just poorly designed and a grand total of TWO of our many cooking spoon will fit on it without simply rolling off because the back is too high and doesn't have the normal "valley" down the center to cradle a spoon's handle that most do.	It's too bad really since it's rather nice looking. But a spoon rest that doesn't rest a spoon is, well.... just a blue owl on your counter in this case.	Back it goes.
1,broke after a half dozen uses
1,This review is for the Sunbeam FPSBHS0302 Black model.		I want my OLD SUNBEAM back! Had it 40 years. It was broken during moving. UGH!!!		Do the people who design mixers know ANYTHING about using one?????!!!!!	REALITY SHOW! Meet the people who design this JUNK! Ask them why they think they are qualified to design mixers. And then fire them!		PROS	Light weight. (It's not just made of plastic, but cheap plastic.)	It has a motor. (on steroids)	The bowl spins without help. (VERY CHEAP plastic spin part.)		CONS	Does NOT have any slow speeds. (Are all new mixers without a slow speed?) Needed for mixing dry ingredients and mixing flour into wet. #1 is very fast and then up to blast off. I kept it on 1 and it spun out of control mixing cookie batter. A slow speed for adding stuff is a MUST HAVE. (NOTE to DESIGNERS: If you don't know what a slow speed looks like, take a cooking class and pay attention!)	The bowl has a part attached which you twist to lock the bowl on the spinner. (We never needed one in the old days.) I can't dunk the bowl in dish water. All kinds of crud can get caught in those deep unseen areas. (Maybe I could take it out back and use a power sprayer to hose it down.)	The beaters are so cute. THEY ARE TOO SMALL! SERIOUSLY?! They look like ones from a child's mixer.	The batter is difficult to remove from the beaters (I had to use my fingers to remove batter).	Beaters miss too many areas in bowl. (I'm not new to using a scraper while mixing.)	Too many buttons, etc. Push button to tilt back (not needed). Twist to remove the bowl(not needed). Push button to release the hand mixing part (not needed). Twist the bowl to remove from stand (not needed). What does YOUR BATTER look like after doing all that before getting it into the oven?		You don't need to design a new mixer. The old one worked just fine.	Do you have to change things so you can keep your job?	SERIOUSLY?! You are in the wrong line of work! Begin looking for another job! NOW!		In case you lost the design from the 1960's, the mixer has a SLOW speed, a normal bowl, normal turn tray (that can be removed for cleaning), normal beaters, and not weigh so much that you have to strain your back removing it from the cabinet. Also, being able to tilt and remove to hand mix, without having to push buttons, would be nice (my old Sunbeam did--just tilt back and lift out). The only buttons needed are for beater release.		You guys who designed this are FIRED!!!		I'm sorry, but we have intelligent people who no one will give a job and idiots who design stuff for the kitchen--don't get me started.
1,The only reason I did not file a consumer fraud complaint was that this vacuum cleaner was gift, and I didn't have to pay for it. Thank goodness for small favors. Other than that, there is nothing about this contraption that I can recommend. It has all the suction power of an 80 year old cigarette smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on an oxygen tank. The cheap plastic attachments are a pain in the backside to use, and the length of the hose is too short. About the only thing it is good for is vacuuming a bare floor. And even then, getting underneath cabinet trim with the "ball" is relatively useless. Carpets? Useless! Why, oh why, did I give away my Dirt Devil?
1,This is an attractive teapot but has 3 major faults. 1, The handle is poorly designed, 2, the spout should be a bit higher, and, 3, worst of all, the inside of the pot has a perforated cover. That cover is meant to act as a filter for the tea leaves, but it is only partially effective and make removing the spent tea leaves very difficult.  I should have asked a few questions before purchasing this teapot.	That being said, it was very inexpensive -- you get what you pay for.
1,I was not pleased with this item even though I read other reviews that said it was not comfortable.  I received it today and did not like the way it fit my rocker.  I have a large rocker and the seat seemed too short.  I either had a drop off in the front or the back.  I did not care for the brownish color of the burgundy but the color they showed for others was not clear.  I thought other reviews may be picky because I order lots of things and there are minor irritations or problems with other things.  I paid too much for this to sit uncomfortably.  Now I will have to pay to return it.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
1,The Docooler light meter functions well enough.  My only gripe with it is a design problem.  The "on" button is exposed so it randomly gets turned in my tool kit and batteries run down.  More than once the batteries were dead when I needed to use the meter.  I now pull the batteries out of the meter and carry them in my bag to put it when I use it... but it's not effecient.  I'm going to look for another model with a protected "on" button and retire this one.  .
1,I like these cups; however, the handle of the 1/4 cup measuring cup broke off with just normal use.  I can't seem to find AMCO's website to maybe get the matter resolved.  I'd get something else that has the handles attached more securely.
1,I received this dispenser as a gift and love it so much I gifted my grandchildren...easy to use and refill. Dispenser can be adjusted to provide huge amount of soap or small as needed. Anything to encourage hand washing! However, I've been through three of them...they keep leaking.
1,Flimsy...clothes crush it and make it lopsided.  There is no rigidity at all....you fight it at every turn of the wheels.		Broke in six months.  Truly flimsy.
1,Wrong product was sent, it looks like a spoon rest.
1,This was a Christmas present.  And, it worked great for the first week.  After the fifth bottle; it broke.  There is a plastic insert that guides the screw.  It does not stand up to the pressure.  I had some problems communicating with OGGI customer service.  They wanted pictures.  I sent them.  I also told them the design was faulty and I did not want another one unless it had a better design.  They returned a second one of the same construction and design that I believe was not new.  It did not work at all; period.  I believe they took another returned item without checking it, and sent it to me.  I will never buy a product from this company.  My Warning And Recommendation Is To Stay Away....		From my perspective, OGGI makes junk....  And, does not stand behind their products...
1,I gave it 2 stars because it serves its purpose. However, it is cheap looking.
1,Nice looking flatware but to my surprise this so called 18/10 flatware scratches so easily that maintaining the original factory shine is not going to happen. Just after three uses this flatware shows significant scratching of the surfaces on the bottom of the spoons and surfaces of the knives..........I hand wash all of my flatware and have for years used Towle and Oneida, with no such issues. Back to Oneida for me and to the every day junk drawer for these Henckels.
1,My machine is currently at the repair shop. At first like other reviewers I thought this was a good juicer.  However after a couple months (I juice anywhere from a few times a week to once daily) the strainer broke.  They sent me a new strainer and about a month later I noticed that the juicer started to produce foam.  Basically when I make a juice, using kale, cucumbers and apple, for example, less then half is juice and the rest is foam.  I am very careful about thoroughly cleaning the juicer immediately after each use, so I was surprised when they told me to clean the strainer in hot water.  That did not work and then they sent me some parts to try and fix it, but not of the parts they sent helped. Finally they asked me to send the juicer in.  After having it for almost 3 weeks their salesperson just informed me that the juicer is performing according to specifications and they are not going to fix it.  It's very annoying as I have to spoon the foam away before drinking it.  As soon as they return to me I will post a video review.		Stay away from this machine. I think soon you will see other people posting similar issues with this juicer.	Here is a link to the picture of how much foam I am getting:	[...]
1,The lid only fits well if you use the vegetable steamer basket. The rice does not steam,soften,become sticky as well as it could if the lid fit better.
1,The knobs themselves are ok. Maybe a little on the pricey side. But I blame the ridiculous cost of the le creuset knobs for driving it up.		The real problem here is the packaging... It took me nearly 20 minutes to get 2 of them completely out of the packaging. The first problem is that they are not only vacuum sealed in the package but the plastic used is also adhesive. Why they need to be sticky and suctioned, I don't know. But the end result is something to behold.		The plastic rips easier than it peels off the knob. So you end up with little bits of plastic and adhesive stuck all over the knob that you end up having to pick/scrape/rub off. If you don't get it completely clean and free of gunk, you will end up with that gunk permanently tattooed all over your shiny knob.		Peel your knob, free it from debris, then polish your knob well prior to inserting it in the oven.
1,wasted money. tape is not strong enough to hold a large bunch of bananas.  another item that is a waste of money.  don't buy this. just pull your bananas apart and lay them in a basket with something soft. they last longer.
1,They were too expensive to be made of thin cardboard.
1,Half of t he heating elements quit working after 6 months of sporadic use.
1,Works as advertised but works no better than a 24 hr soak in brine.
1,Thin  VERY THIN  after i was told by Utopia Kitchen  that these where replacements for the other dish towels they discontinued,  Shame  so now they are on the way back  cause these are basically nothing but hemmed cheese cloth  :(
1,Very cheaply made, doesn't retain their softness after a few washes
1,The fineshing wasn't that good the glass looks cheap and the black looks old and gets derty easly.	it dosn't hold the heat
1,They took FOREVER to get here and I had no idea they were coming from China. I never would have never bought them if I knew that. Not only did it take over a month for me to get them, they're in tiny packages and you have to peel the paper-thin petals apart. This is tedious and they're not even pretending to look semi-real. I am incredibly disappointed I waited so long for this sub-par product. Honestly, I won't waste your money.
1,If you like the smell of old people's soap then this is for you.
1,Shame on Pepsi!  This is not a blanket!!!!		I was keeping it for an emergency in the winter, and when my car broke down in the Rocky Mountains, I was shocked to find out how thin it was.  I suffered from hypothermia and required medical attention!!!
1,I bought this on recommedation from America's Test Kitchen, but I have not been impressed.  Basically it's just a plastic-ware container with a lid that can strain.  The lid doesn't even go on the container while the pasta is being cooked. You could pretty much use any glassware to replace it and I would like it better, as I'm not a fan of microwaving plastic as it is.  Save your money and buy some cheap glassware instead.
1,I bought this before checking out the legs of my ironing board,  The legs were on an angle so this didn't work
1,I've been suffering through months of neck pain and migraines with a bonus dose of nausea and vertigo. I've been able to mitigate it slightly by ditching my pillows and using a rolled towel at my neck. While not a terrible way to sleep, it's not ideal. Several people recommended this neck pillow to me and the reviews looked good. After one night--my neck seized back up. I awoke to severe pain, stiffness and yep--a headache and nausea.
1,Took 3 tries before one arrived with the inside lip not cracked. Poor craftsmanship, cute look if you don't look to closely.
1,kind of disappointed.  it's expensive and i'm sure it will last...but the top jiggles around and there is no strainer at the pouring lip like there is on every other french press i've bought.  you have to hold the top when pouring because it feels like it will fall into your cup.
1,very poor quality, would not reccomend this product to anyone, plus it only has 2 sizes of plate, very large and very small, no in between anyway, I returned it and was very pricey to return, so think twice about this product
1,The blade became detached from the grip. Worked great while it lasted.
1,Used chair, Shame on Amazon, AGAIN!!!  a light cut at the  top of the chair thats ready to tear,  dirty stains on back of chair.  screw hole for bottom back plate was damaged so screw only went half way in.  All the screw holes were burred.  I can tell the mech shaft was already hammered out for a return.  But I put it together anyway cause I'm desperate for a chair and None of the levers for the lift or tilt  even work, they do absolutely nothing!!!!  The thing is broken.  Not only that the  Chair reclines all the way back with 0 tension.  Chair is not useable.  Called the company true innovations.  This item is out of stock,  like most of the chairs amazon sells apparenlty.		Beware if you order a chair from Amazon,  90% chance it will be refurbished.		Update: company said they can send me a replacement bottom seat in 4-6 weeks.  I'm hoping that will fix the problem of the seat cushion cutting the circulation from under my legs as well as the burred screwhole.  I also figured out how to get the lift working.  The handles that go over the metal bars are really worn so you have to finess it and turn them ever so slightly so that they catch the metal grooves on the bars.  If you turn too hard they just go over them.  And when they catch, you have to carefully turn the knobs very slightly left or right and the lift and tilt lock work.		But even at the lowest setting this chair is very tall.  Because the seat is leaning so far back so much I'm basically on my toes  and I'm 6'4 !  lmao.  Now I know what some other reviewers were talking about, which is the reason I got this chair.  but wow.  I hope I get the replacement seat and it alleviates this problem,  otherwise its probably the mech unit is worn and not sure if company True innovations will replace that too.
1,When this product arrived the lid latch was already cracking at the seam. I immediately returned it. Very low quality, avoid.
1,was not good as shown in picture&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/FatColo-12-Piece-Artificial-Wisteria-Vine-Ratta-Silk-Flowers-3-4-Feet-Purple/dp/B00VAHKD5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">FatColo 12-Piece Artificial Wisteria Vine Ratta Silk Flowers, 3.4-Feet, Purple</a>&nbsp;I was very upset when I saw that
1,It arrived broken.
1,Does not fit standard cga-600 disposable Oxegen bottles.
1,Comfortable and stable stool. Arrived with large scratches on seat due to only a partial sticker as "packaging". I added floral decals to the seat back to make these look better
1,Lasted three trips and one of the straps broke. Got a few compliments about the totes themselves, but too afraid to put anything heavy/breakable in them, so they went back to Amazon.
1,The paint started running after i used the shower from minimal steam. The art work is definitely not sealed which I don't understand.
1,We have had these recliners for a few months and they have completely broken down!!!  They are much darker than pictured.  We have donated both to charity, so they were an expensive venture.
1,About three months into use, rust is starting to appear on the shelves of the chrome version. The pole is starting to show a couple tiny specks of rust but the shelves are a little worse along rust-wise. This is placed in the rear corner of our tub, in the opposite side from the shower head. This unit is not in direct water flow, just getting steam and occasional droplets. Previous to this, we had a chrome caddy that hung from the shower head and after five years it was almost completely disintegrated so we got this one. The hanging caddy was in a position that it receive much more water spray so we weren't surprised. Perhaps it should have been wiped down after use. Other reviewers said the bronze version was better with rust, so maybe we'll try that one in the future.		Regarding height, our bathroom has 9' ceilings, and the tub is about 16" or so. The pole fits, however it's very tight and seems to be separating the ceiling drywall from the wall. It's not broken through, but the stress seems to have separated that drywall just a tiny bit. Our tub was refinished, so when we were re-installing the caddy, it slipped out from the pressure and started a crack on the seam of one of the support tubes.
1,During the time that it worked, it was great. Large display, good alarm sound.	While I am still able to set the timer, the sound has stopped working.	The timer wobbles back and forth when pressing buttons on the fridge.
1,Not brown...orange, but alas I'm going to give them to the girls.	The price was the best for these so that's the only reason I'm not hopping mad and just disappointed.
1,Pretty, but not what you would take to the beach, even though that what is in the picture.  It is like a sheet, not a towel.  I returned it.
1,came broken, poor materials and way too many pieces to assemble.
1,Don't like the bottom of the mat,I have urethane on my counter tops and the backing make it bubble if there's any moisture
1,This came apart the first time I pulled a bag out of it. The elastic was not sewed in or heavy enough for the usage something like this is going to require.
1,While this is a good brand item, it turned out to be too weak for 1 panel of a light woven fabric.  Have to buy something else.
1,I am really disappointed with this product. I have had it less than 2 months and one of the grinders has stopped working.  Unfortunately it is past the time that I can return the item and the warranty information provided on the page is for a garbage can, not the grinder. I would not recommend this grinder.
1,Too small did not work for what we needed
1,I ordered these bags, and they arrived in a small box folded over twice. Every single.one of the bags had holes in them. If they would have been packaged properly they would have been fine, but every single one ended up being worthless and a waste of my time and money.
1,ok.. the pump is not working nicely
1,Seems to be well made, but is VERY small.
1,Really, really small.
1,Uploaded a picture, brand new out the box it looks like cheap metal, with rust.... This stuff is going in your coffee....I used it today one time to give it a chance, but coffee grinds go in the coffee, just nasty.... Returning and ordering a French press thing....
1,Cheap. Crappy. Its super difficult to open and close the drawer.
1,I wanted to go from plastic containers to glass containers. I was so happy when my glass containers arrived. I had leftover rice in one of the containers and took it from fridge to microwave and had it in for about 90 seconds or so . I had added a bit water so the rice would not dry out. I had a paper towel over ( Not the lid) and after i took it out of microwave I set it on wooden cutting board .I took the paper towel off and turned around to throw it away and the whole dish just exploded. I had glass everywhere. Called the company and they wanted me to send pictures which I did and they said they would refund me the money. 2 months later I am still waiting. I went online to see if other people had this problem since the company told me this is the first they heard about it . I found people complaining back in 2012 about this problem. This product is NOT SAFE. They need to pull this of the shelves. I am so glad my grand daughter was not in the kitchen with me at the time and I am glad that I was not hurt. I am adding photos..keep in mind I did NOT have a lid on. I laid the lid next to it to show that it was indeed the Rubbermaid Easy Find Lid Containers
1,total junk, broke within the first month
1,The company was wonderful in processing a refund, but the bag was definitely not of good quality.  If you really want to protect your clothing, look at another product.
1,This popper worked great about 4 times, but then the glass shattered.  So it's a great idea with a fatal flaw.
1,Not worth it! This pan is junk. Feels strange and bumpy, center arches up and is not flat so it cooks oddly and burns  around the edges, bit doesn't cook well in the center. I am highly disappointed with this pan. Doesn't even make a good pizza pan, with the hump in the center. Stick to LODGE!
1,Not even used half a dozen times, and the side ripped out of one of the bags. I would spend more money and get a better quality product.
1,I ordered 2 packs of 20 magnets each for a total of 40 magnets and was charged $21.90. I received 2 packs of 10 magnets each for a total of 20 magnets.
1,THIS HEATER DOES NOT COME WITH A BLOWER.  I used the amazon app to buy this heater.  On features bottom line, it states "integrated blower."  It does not say "(not included)."		Apparently it was my fault because on the website, it shows 2 lines below "sold separately."  However, it is not sold separately because it is simply not sold.  Not even the manufacturer has the blowers in stock.  That's just sucky business.  I now have a battery operated fan next to the heater to distribute the heat.
1,I thought it wasn't working so I unplugged it. Then it thawed out and made a big mess. There is no temperature sensor in these, and if the temp gets below 45 degrees or so they just ice up. It is worthless on my boat in winter.
1,photo print
1,I had ordered MANY of these units over the past several years - at the time, they had SMALLER beads inside that changed from blue (dry) to pink (wet). The small units would dry in about 12 hours, the larger units about 24 hours.  These latest units have very large beads that change from a yellow-amber color (dry) to a deep green (wet).  I have had the unit plugged in for about 4 days and it is STILL dark green. For some reason, it will not dry the beads. I do not know if it's because they made the beads so large that, once saturated, they simply cannot dry out, or if there is another reason. If I do order these again, I will NOT order the large bead units - I'll either order small beads, or smaller units that contain smaller beads. I tried to find merchant feedback on this, but since it's handled by Amazon, I do not see a place for an inquiry.		# # # #  UPDATE!	I actually left a unit plugged in too long, trying to dry out the large green beads. I finally decided to hang it in the closet, just to see what would happen. Well, apparently because I left it plugged in for about 5 days, it must have weakened the glue holding the unit together. The plug came out of the unit while hanging, the unit fell on the carpeted closet floor and broke, sending the beads all over (and there are a TON of them). But, at least I was able to see that the beads INSIDE the unit were dry, just the green beads on the viewing window were still green. The problem is still that the green beads (which are the indicator of "wet" or "dry") are still green, so there's no practical way to use them. If you can't tell whether the inside beads are dry or not, it's useless. I guess you could try to keep track of the dates, but that's NOT how they are supposed to work.  They just need to stick to the smaller beads, I guess!  So my conclusion is the same - go for the smaller units/beads.
1,This product is suppose to be ivory and its yellowish. Won't bother returning it as its more hassle to return, I will just donate it to good will.
1,These are very nice looking and I'll enjoy them during our upcoming camping trip.  But, they are available for less at Walmart.
1,Very Disappointed - these tress are nothing like the picture - not even close!!! sent both of them back!
1,I want to like this mandoline.  It has many features that I'm looking for and it would be perfect except for one small problem:  the blade is very dull.		Otherwise, it's fantastic.  It's one of the widest handheld mandolines I've owned, so I don't have to search for smaller fruits and vegetables to fit the mandoline.  Very large pears fit with room to spare.  Most of the onions I have on hand at the moment will fit, except perhaps at the widest point of the largest ones.		The adjustable slices are also great.  The thickest slice is a generous quarter inch, which means that out of all the mandolines I've owned, this one produces the thickest slices.  It also has medium and thin slice options.		The adjustable guide also has a "lock" position, which completely blocks the blade.  To me this is easier than trying to keep track of a separate plastic cover that never seems to be where I left it by the time the dishwasher is done.		The adjustable guide is secured so it doesn't pop back up while slicing to block the blade, as it does on the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OXO-handheld-mandoline/dp/B000YDO2LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OXO handheld mandoline</a>.  This means that the slices are even instead of tapering off on one side.		Like all handheld mandolines that I've tried, it doesn't take up much space and can be slipped into a narrow space in a cabinet or hung from a hook.  To be honest, this is the reason why I keep trying to find a good handheld slicer instead of one of the larger ones.		But the blade.  Oh man, it's so very dull.  Ripe pears were hard to slice, and often broke (even on the thickest setting) instead of slicing cleanly.  Not only does a dull blade make this slicer very hard to use, but the force required to push the food means that if you slip and your hand hits the blade, you are in for a very painful cut.  Worse, while getting injured on a sharp blade is bad, getting injured on a dull blade is terrible, since it doesn't produce a clean cut that will heal quickly.		The safety guard that comes with this mandoline isn't all that useful, either.  Short spikes don't really grip the food well, and are even more likely to slip when using the force needed with this dull blade.  I tried it and was not able to get one slice without having the onion jump off the guard.  I strongly recommend wearing a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/nitrile/dp/B002UFLQ60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">nitrile</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/cut-resistant-glove/dp/B003DZ02MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">cut-resistant glove</a>&nbsp;with this slicer, even if you use the safety guard.  If you slip and hit the blade it will still hurt, but hopefully you'll be able to avoid stitches.		If this slicer had a sharp blade it would be exactly what I've been looking for for many years.  But it's more dull than the old mandoline I was looking to replace.  I'll be buying a new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kuhn-Rikon-mandoline/dp/B000II4AIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kuhn Rikon mandoline</a>, the same one I used to have, with (unfortunately) one thickness. It's not adjustable and it's not nearly as wide as this one, but two blades mean slicing is twice as quick and my old one was very sharp for about five years.
1,Way to flimsy.
1,did not last too long.  The wire connection is bent, pretty weak connection. Have problem with the size of the opening.
1,Unfortunately this blender leaks from the top so I need to hold it and a towel to it when I blend.  It would be nice to not need to hold it in place when I blend.  The bottom also has a tendency to unscrew unless I hold it in place.  Otherwise the look and function is top-notch but these issues are a big inconvenience for me.
1,we bought another home dynamix premium rug, which came in a box, flattened out fine, and looks great. I rated it 5 stars. This rug, which seems to be basically the same quality, came without a box, and as a result has some intractable creases. We've had it on the floor for about a week now, with books and other heavy stuff on the creases, and they're still there. I'm still hoping it will flatten out, but it looks pretty crummy for now, and it's annoying to have to leave piles of stuff all over the floor for so long.
1,This will work, but it is really thin and blows in any slight breeze.  Not a good replacement for the heavy duty one I had before.  It does have magnets at the bottom, which would help anyone who has a tub made of metal though.
1,AFTER 1/2 HOUR AIRING OUT IN MY LV ROOM - THE OFF GASSING WAS SO BAD I HAD GET THIS THING OUT OF MY HOUSE AS IT WAS MAKING MY THROAT ACT UP. NOT GOOD.  RETURNING ASAP.  ALSO - THE COVER IS NOT LIKE THE PHOTO ON THIS WEBSITE.  THE LOGO "ISO COOL"  IS MISSING AND DOES NOT HAVE THE BLUE PIPING AROUND THE EDGE.  I DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE GIVING US WHAT THEY ARE LISTING.
1,I bought this to vacuum my stairs....does not work on carpet, but fine for wood floors.
1,Color was way off
1,Save your money and buy a $25 coffee maker. After about a month this thing still brews coffee and immediately when the pot is done beeps, displays an E3 error code and shuts down of which Krups offers no explanation help. So forget using any of the fancy settings or even setting the clock. Since it still brew coffee that's worth 5 stars minus a star for every feature that doesn't work, which being generous leaves 1 star.
1,I washed these in cold and dryed low the amount of powdery like lint that was in my machine is insane.. and then there is the smell .... but the color is so pretty and Ive bought this brand bfor and never have had a problem I really want to give them one more try bfor returning or exchanging .. I washed one more time this time in warm and again low heat to dry MORE powdery stuff and little	Less stinky but still some kind of smell ...Im gonna have to return im sorry BUT will purchase another set w diff color maybe that will avoid the same problem ive bought white gray and green never a problem  ...prob got a reject dang
1,The suction cups for the bottom is garbage. You guys need to come up with a better way to secure the bottom of the unit to the door.
1,I guess I need to spend more money on sheets. You get what you pay for.		Pros:	- Soft and comfortable.	- Low price.		Cons:	- So thin you can see through them when held up. I think I will use them as a pre-filter in an air cleaner once their wear out...	- I could hear a snapping sound when stretching the elastic around my mattress.	- The fitted sheet barely fit around my 12" memory foam mattress. I will not be surprised if a corner slips off.	- My fitted sheet had a stain dead center. Had me a little worried but they were washed.	- Lots of lint came off in the dryer filter.	- I doubt these will last long.
1,The tree itself is simply brown wire tape wrapped around bendable branches and a thin tube trunk.  The lights are attached by wrapping them in the brown tape.  I don't dislike the look,  It is underwhelming, which is what we were looking for.  Nothing flashy, just a color changing bare branch tree.  The color changing part is where if fell short.  When first plugged in it gradually changes color from red, to purple, to green, to yellow etc. Very pretty andsubtle.  But within ten minutes, the lights are out of sync, and it is a multicolor tree all the time.  At first I thought they had stopped changing color, but they hadn't.  They just no longer are synchronized so that the tree changes from one color to another.  I answered the standard "Are you happy with our product" email, asking me to either give them a great review or email them if I was unhappy.  I sent the email.  They responded with an issue on an entirely different product, and then encouraged me to just send it back.  Not much help.  So here I am with a poor review for a poor product with poor customer service.
1,i returned it,
1,I ordered this for my kids thinking that it would make microwave Smores easier... It's turned out to be a really cumbersome, unnecessary piece of plastic. While it does work, I find that it's just as easy to put the Smores directly on a plate in the microwave- not much difference and much less cleanup
1,Unfortunately, I had high hopes for this product and it didn't relieve anything but actually hurt  It was recommended by my chiropractor but this wasn't the brand he recommended (I couldn't find the one he suggested).  The supplier was kind enough to issue a refund
1,This is not a sturdy paper towel holder.  The metal is thin and the item is lightweight.  The one that I received arrived with the pole leaning over to one side.  The entire design is flimsy, and even if it arrives in good shape, I would not expect it to last long.  I am sending this one back, as it is clearly defective.  I am not going to order it again.
1,I got this projection atomic clock in August 2011.  It's May 2013 and the projection for the time has started breaking up.  I like it otherwise but for the money I would expect it to last longer.  I'll be looking for another brand this time around.
1,The moment I took it out of the box, the front wood was broken and I had to fix it myself.
1,I don't know what I'm doing wrong but these do not stay up in the shower. I followed all the instructions exactly, cleaned off the tile with alcohol, (it was already clean but I wiped it with alcohol just to be sure), applied the adhesive and put up the hook. I waited several hours before hanging anything on this. During the night, after a shower, the hook fell off. I tried again, using new adhesive pads and again cleaned the tile with alcohol. This time I let it sit for over 24 hours before using the shower. Once again, within an hour or two, the hook fell off.	I see other reviews that rave about these hooks for the shower so I'd love to know what I'm doing wrong as I really need something like this.
1,I would not buy these again.  They're cheaper than some of the other timers with large figures but they don't work nearly as well.  And they seem to eat batteries very quickly.  One of 4-pack I received has never worked and I replaced the battery that came with it.  The second one is working so far.
1,Cheap and very light material. It's definitely NOT non stick and the paint came off after the first wash. Put in the garbage after just one use
1,The color of these towels wasn't anything like what I expected. To top it off, now I have to PAY to ship them back. My Amazon orders will be severely curtailed in the future. Too bad. I enjoyed the excellent service while it lasted.
1,Displeased with this.  All the legs make this awkward to use (can only draw things from and that can be restricted depending on your cabinet structure), and, takes up too much space.
1,I bought this last year, after Christmas since my old rotating tree stand was on slowly dying. when i received it, i plugged it in to be sure it worked.	Now, i set it up for Christmas this year. It's horrible. It's clicking and making all kind of noises. It also rotates every 45 seconds, not every 60 seconds, as advertised. It's dizzying, how much 15 seconds matters. Luckily, I hadn't decorated the tree. I ordered my old stand again. i guess it's too late to return it now....
1,Ugly and if had lime green also.
1,Went to open a van and it bent in the middle
1,Its a foam mattress comes compressed in a vacuum plastic bag. Unless "EURO TOP SPRING" stands for Spring in Europe. Constantly feel like rolling off onto the floor from this mattress. It's high with the box spring.
1,I did not have a problem with the color. It was fairly accurate for me, although they are a bit on the yellow end, but still close.	But I do have a problem with the packaging, which is ridiculously impossible.	They come packaged in 100 individual packets of about 200 petals pressed together so that they cannot be used individually. It is IMPOSSIBLE to peel them apart, they are pressed together and cut like post-it notes, except they are basically attached. Its insane and lazy to provide a product like this. Very disappointed.
1,Did not adequately prevent handle from being too hot to hold; still need to use hot pad(s) or mitt.
1,Won't pump. Never worked.
1,Disappointed! bought this for toaster oven use as I checked in search and when I got the plate it states Not to be used in toaster oven!
1,This was my 4th contigo & it is by far the most disappointing. I use them all for water & not only did it not stay cold for at least 4 hours, the water was actually warm!! I noticed it is not as heavy as my first four & now I am convinced either this is a defect or it's a knock off. Either way it's going back.
1,Edited on February 5 to add: I was hoping to grow to like this grill because of the terrible mistake I made in assuming that it would be a great quality item like my previous Foreman grills were and buying 3 additional sets of plates for it, but alas, I really hate this grill and now it's a one star item.		The maximum time on this unit is 20 minutes. The timer does not go any higher. If you set the grill at 350 and put it on for 20 minutes, the 20 minutes will run out before the grill reaches the proper temperature. What's the point? Every other appliance I have that requires preheating waits until the preheat temperature is reached before beginning the timer countdown. This is not rocket science.		The only way to use this grill is to wing it. Turn it on, wait until it feels hot and put food on it until you think it's cooked. The manufacturer responded in a comment to my post to contact them. Why? So they can tell me to pay to return a brand new defective item to them so they can send me a refurbished unit with the same issues? The design of the grill is for the time to count down as soon as you turn it on so that won't change. As for the ridiculous time it takes to preheat, that's also a "feature" of this thing because of all the other comments that say the same thing.		I have used Foreman grills for years and love them so when I my T-Fal Optigrill died, I not only used a bunch of gift cards to get this Evolve grill, and then tossed in a lot of my own funds to outfit it with several additional plate types: omelet, waffle, short baking pan.		This is how it is supposed to work:	The instruction booklet says to turn on the grill, set the temperature and the time. When the desired temperature is reached, the temperature number will stop blinking and it will beep to let you know to put the food on.		How it really works:	You turn it on and press the temperature to set it to, let's say 400 for 18 minutes. The 400 continues blinking and the timer counts down. Logic says that the timer should not begin counting down until it reaches 400 degrees. I guess it doesn't matter though, because while the grill got hot, the 18 minutes ran out before it beeped and the 400 went solid. I tried it again and it took the full max of 20 minutes and the grill never reached 400. Once it reached that temperature, it said "On" in the timer window so I had no idea how much time was left. Pressing the temp/timer button is pot luck as to which function will adjust when you press the arrow keys. You cannot add time once the "On" word is on the screen. There is no explanation for how any of this works in the booklet that came with it.		This is a very frustrating appliance that was poorly designed. My toaster over goes to 425 in 5 minutes and only then does the timer begin counting down. This is going to be hard on my electric bill if I use it often. Such a shame.
1,Great design but the product came with two defects. The first is the table itself. Picture shows the uneven side. QC should have caught this. The second is the spot where two pieces meet together. On 3 sides they meet, but one side there is an 1/8 of an inch gap.	I know amazon has an amazing return policy, but honestly who want to take apart a table and repack it, so I'll just keep and live with the flaws (of my OCD let's me )	Just realize that the price is great but the product may have some flaws.
1,Thick, but so stiff they're hard to use.  Got all bunch after washing.
1,The spread will start falling apart after a couple months and the first time it is washed.
1,The first one of these I ever bought was Great quality. I just bought another 2, and it shipped from China and 1 was broken. I could tell these 2 were not of the same quality as the first one and I was disappointed. I had no idea these were coming from China otherwise I wouldn't have bought them. I thought these were the same quality as the first one, but clearly I was wrong. I guess the reduced price is a hint along with the spoons not having an engraving on the back as to who makes them (like my first one did).
1,The caps are ridiculously hard to use. I replaced them with a cork type.  The bottles are great. The caps are junk.
1,very disappointed.  Rug has a nickel size hole where dye is missing and some fading around border. Too much hassle to repack and return, so stuck it in laundry room. hey, cant win em all, but most everything I get from amazon is spot on.
1,Beautiful shelving unit. Would have given more stars except 2 of the shelves were warped out of the box. I didn't notice until after the entire unit was put together. These shelves are very sturdy so not sure why they would have been bowed except being a manufacturing/storage issue. Very disappointed. The unit is very large and would be hard to return. I also bought the matching corner unit which was delivered in perfect condition. My advice: check every shelf before assembling.
1,I will start with the one thing I do like about this sweeper...that's the hose and the fact that it's light weight and not like so many vacuums today where the handle is part of the hose/wand (which makes it heavier and harder to use).  I have always liked Dirt Devil and we have owned them for over 30 years but sadly they no longer make sturdy, solid products.  The best one they've ever had was the ROYAL APPLIANCE Dirt Devil Power Reach Pet Upright Vacuum Model #UD70095 but I can't find it anywhere. The hose feature is the only reason I purchased this Dirt Devil...we can't stand the handle/hose combo on most all other vacuums so we went back to Dirt Devil for their easy to use hoses/attachments, however, the actual vacuum is so cheaply made that it almost feels like a toy.  The first thing I noticed after the cheap build and parts was that the power seemed to weaken off and on, almost like it was about to quit and then it didn't.  Then the hose that attaches to the sweeper itself to vacuum in the normal manner kept coming out of it's connection, over and over again, no matter how tight I put it back in.  That never happened on our other Dirt Devils.  This vacuum is also very loud and runs rough so I have no idea how long it will actually last.  I did lots of research on the different Dirt Devils and this was one of the higher rated ones and yet I'm not sure why.  This will barely be good enough for our basement but it would never be able to handle our other floors with thicker carpet and dog hair.  I'm disappointed.
1,Looks bright and vibrant with flowers, very light with pastels and washed out. Nothing line the picture
1,great idea but it broke quickly after use
1,Rust's shortly after installed.
1,Deceptively light weight and easy to set up because it's really, really sturdy.  It has screw holes for attaching a headboard and foot board if you like. The king size is actually two twins with joiners, this makes moving the frame much easier than a one piece king size would be.  The size is perfect, a standard king size mattress is just a smidge larger than the frame, so you don't see or touch the metal frame.  It's easy to move the mattress intentionally, but it doesn't slide around on you.  You'll probably want either bed linens that hang a bit lower than your mattress or a bed skirt to conceal the legs.  I'm using it with a memory foam mattress and it's working quite well.  If anything, it's firmer than when the mattress was on a wood frame with 2x4's as support slats. Depending on your preference, that may be a good or bad thing, but I'm satisfied.		Update 11/22/14		Downgraded from 5 stars to 3.  After less than six months of use this bed got very, very noisy.  It still seems sturdy, but it squeaks with almost every movement.		Update 2016		Downgrading to 1 star.  With a year the frame was so badly warped that the bed had a visible dip and was terribly uncomfortable to sleep on.  My husband is over 200 lbs, but he's well under the suggested weight limit for this bed.
1,This product looks very well made and OEM, but the gasket issue annoys me.		For one, the gasket that it came with broke after maybe 4 uses, creating it to leak everywhere. My original magic bullet base gasket lasted for several years, so I'm going to assume there was no user error on my end (what kind of user error could even break a gasket?).		The second issue, a follow-up issue to the first one, is that the magic bullet OEM gaskets do NOT fit this base. They're just a smidge too big, which causes it to bunch up a little when you put it in and not create a seal.		So, once the gasket breaks, you're rendered with a useless base. You can NOT get the OEM gaskets to fit in this thing. I even made a last ditch effort to cut the OEM gasket and trim off a mm of material, but it leaks as one would expect.
1,My first try resulted in very cold vanilla milk.  I put the canister in the freeze for 4 days.  Ran it for 40 mns.  Right now the canister is in the freezer with the cold vanilla milk.  Hope it freezes up
1,First let me say that design wise (both look and functionality) this is an amazing machine.  It is super easy to operate, makes great "coffee" (ie coffee based drinks alone) and makes good milk drinks... if you don't mind them being luke warm.		So why 2 stars?  Because at the end of the day the value proposition for this device is milk drinks.  It makes little sense to pay over $3000 dollars for a machine that just pours coffee... there are less expensive and better machines for that.		I have to second TJ's (another reviewer here) comments on this machine regarding milk temperature... the big Achilles heel of the Z6.  If you use cold milk, say 37-40 degrees as it should be, the best you will get out of the machine for milk (not heavy froth) is 125 degrees.  This is the limit of the capability of the machine to heat the milk.  Froth will likely be a bit warmer but not much.		As TJ had stated in his review milk for milk drinks should be around the 145-150 range.  Anything below and you are forced to drink faster than you might want to so it's still hot (although with the Jura it's at best warm) and anything above that and you lose sweetness in the milk and can scald it.  The Jura fails to achieve close to a proper range if using cold milk.		There's a potential way to solve this dilemma but it also means losing much of the value of the machine (which is speed and convenience) and that is to use warm milk.  In my tests if the milk is above 50 degrees you'll hit 140 and if it's hotter you can get as high as 160.  I will be evaluating this more and will post my results.  So, to get the right drink from the machine it means losing time up front to warm the milk above cold... and potentially losing milk lifespan if you want to use a filled container.  The solution I am testing now is to use a Breville milk frother to just warm the milk to about 55-60 degrees and see how that works out.		I really wanted to love this device.  It really is a marvel.  Expensive, but does almost everything you could ask for in a super automatic and the yield is fantastic (for a super automatic).  But the milk temperature is close to a deal breaker.		More tests to come but for now... I cannot recommend.
1,ordered as a replacement for a unit I've had for 8 years, thought the color display would be a nice change.  Beautiful out of the box.  If you are looking directly at it and the unit is plugged in, you have all the pretty colors on the display and the numbers are sharp and clear.  But if you move two feet in either direction, the display numbers disappear completely.  It will run on batteries but the screen goes monochrome, has the same visual from different angles.  It's shame to pay this much for a "color" unit that doesn't stay that way.  Had it plugged in for over an hour, the clock never set.  I set the clock manually, lost two minutes within the next hour.  Returning to try a different product.
1,This isn't much of a cushion. If you were picking it up in the dollar store it might be ok for some things, but it most definitely is not worth $15. I'm very disappointed in it. Wish I would have just stuck it back in the package and sent it right back.
1,I purchased this toaster off Ebay (new in box) impressed with the "Professional" designation. It did not work when it arrived. The push down lever would not budge. I opted for a refund over replacement because the construction was flimsy, like cheap tin. Will stay away from Waring products in the future.
1,Received the wrong size twice. Quality looks good but was unable to get the 6' diameter and had to cancel order.
1,I ordered 2 of these on Feb 9th and received them on March 4th. One arrived with the top diamond piece broken off from the stopper and the second one had a weird discoloration on the metal that almost looks like an oil stain. They are very light and cheap feeling. You definitely get what you pay for with this item!
1,The pictures look much better than the product. Because on the 2D-flattened pictures you get to see a denser design and you get the impression that there is quite a bit going for it in the way of looks - but then you get the vase and there it is, almost a bare quart-sized pitcher-like vase. The glass itself is probably crystal, but I have seen crystal that is a lot more transparent and a lot more polished/sparkly. This feels more like a heavy glass with some squibble lines here and there. Some folks would call this minimalistic design, but it really does not fit the shape or the crystal quality, and it feels instead bare and un-inspired.
1,I wish I could give zero stars. Ordered ivory and it's completely yellow not even close to ivory and it's also terrible quality. Lesson learned order from party city.
1,See through thin and very cheap feeling.
1,We bought these sticks for cake pops. They are too short. We had to go to craft store to get sticks long enough to hold the cake pop and not fall apart.
1,I am giving this two stars. Reason being, it is beautiful. A great looking piece of furniture. However, the quality appears to be quite poor on the seat.	When I first got this piece on January 9, 2017 I was super excited. We really needed a bench seat to fit our growing family and this one matched perfectly.	However, not even three months later, the seat is torn at the seam. It is torn on the side that my 52 pound, 7-year old daughter sits. They are not hard on it at all...just normal use. We only use this table once per day for dinners.	Again, this is a beautiful piece and the legs seem just fine and sturdy. But I am very, super bummed by the quality of the cushion. I am including photos so you can see they beauty of it and then the tear.
1,Purchased with the intent of using for carrying soup to school/work, then heating in microwave.  These LEAK!  Not at all useful for that purpose...		Now I just read some other reviews and noticed that others say "this isn't supposed to be leakproof, rather it is to heat things in microwave..."  Well, what is the point of a lid that locks in 3 places in the microwave?  really?  Come on, you could set a lid on in there to contain splatters etc.		Anyway, very disappointed that the "This product leaks, don't use it to carry soup" isn't clearly stated in the product description.
1,I bought the set but didn't fit my Bose speakers as advertised. If you Bose, don't bother it won't work.
1,One place says it's 26cm, another place says 24cm. Which one am I supposed to believe? And how can it be 24 x 11 x 9cms? That's about 9 1/2", x 4 1/2" x 3 1/2".  The bowl is 3 1/2' in diameter, and 1 1/2" deep, and does NOT match the description. Plus, the ladle is too lightweight and flimsy. The only thing that is right is the height, and that's wrong, because it's too short for a ladle!!
1,Having a Star of David on the top of our Christmas tree was important to my husband and so it was important to me. 6 years ago I did so much research to find one that fit perfectly with my decor and something that glowed, because i love glowing stars. I found the one on the left and was so in love! So much so that when Kurt emailed me for my opinion (not a generic email)  i wrote a raving one. I always always refuse those things. I even posted on SM like he asked.  He was so happy and nice! It was a new company? I love this beautiful star. Then, after 6ish years it became tedious having to turn it off every night since it's battery powered. Id have to dig through the tree branches to find the switch.  I have a thing about Christmas decorations. They all may be on 1 switch so i flick and they all come on together. One inside and one for outside. but i loved this star so much!		He finally produced one with a cord so it can join is decoration friends! This one is the one on the right. Wow. Disappointment doesn't describe my feelings well enough. I'm blown away. I can't put this on my tree! The quality is vastly different though only a bit more expensive than the first. It's lopsided. The blue is sticking out of the wiring in places, highly noticeable. The wiring is cheap and bending. It's flimsy. The first  star looked gorgeous in the sunlight and glowing at night.		I'm so sad .
1,The coaster are very nice looking.  Nice ends there.  They work the same as any other poorly made coaster.  The water pooled on top of the coaster and went onto my table, they left water rings and the cork become moldy.  Very expensive for something that does not work.  Should have sent back but did not want to pay the return postage.
1,Good addition to give your kitchen a nice feel, but other than that the knives are useless. I like my blades super sharp and these are too blunt for my taste. i have replaced most of the set with my Victorinox knives. The base provides a nice storage space for my good knives
1,They don't hold books up. Not even childrens books.
1,I guess I need to keep experimenting with this.... I follow all the prescribed instructions, but I've been adding more and more water (or other liquid, like vegetable or chicken broth) and I never seem to have enough liquid.  All rices so far burn and stick horrendously.  I've done both white and brown rice, with the same, over-cooked, burned results...
1,one side of the knobs for adjusting the thickness of the slices has already stripped out. this is something I do not use every day, so it certainly should have lasted longer than 4 months.
1,Very cheaply made fabric, low quality and not as big as it is said to be, just barely fits over the side of my Queen. I don't recommend this product unless you're buying it for a Twin or Full sized bed.
1,Too hot! Read so many reviews and went with this one. Live in Florida, and even with thin sheets and ceiling fans, this has zero flow. Lumpy too. If you want something thick, hot, and bumpy- this is made for you.
1,Had to return it.. Would not hold a charge. Keep blinking on bright and then dim after two days of charging in direct sunlight
1,I just returned mine. It leaked -- just as others have reported.		Twice the top fell off while I was pouring my martini. The first time I thought I must have put it on too loosely. The second time I knew it was not anything I did. Its a shame that such a well designed utensil has such poor quality control.
1,Followed assembly instructions but after 2 days the rack fell to the floor while I was sitting in my living room.  It just would not provide enough tension.  Once you set it you cant go back and adjust it.  A lot of these use that same mechanism for height adjustment.  Why cant someone make one that can be re-adjusted or hold tight?
1,Too stiff! Although they are softer than most, too many micro beads to smush around neck comfortably! I gave it 2 stars because it is well made and nice fabric...just too stiff
1,Great concept, I like how they nest together and the colors but the non-skid strips on the bottoms are ripping and coming off, this was happening after very little use (less than 10 times) and hand washing only, we always stacked them neatly in the cupboard and our daughter never played with them or tossed them around, so they definitely are just cheaply made.		After ordering these in late 2015 after our daughter was born, I ordered a replacement and cannot for the life of me remember why (currently have preggo brain with our 2nd) but I can assume it was from a flaw.
1,We bought this item, based on reviews but when we received it we loaded it with the salt and pepper recommended and it refused to grind, efficiently, from either the salt or pepper end.  We added a different size of salt and pepper and had the same, frustrating results.  Perhaps, this works with a very specific size grain but we were unable to find it.  Returned this item.
1,On the positive side, this vacuum works well on hard floors (not well on carpet), it's very easy to handle, charging base station is convenient, and new battery lasts at least 10 minutes. Unfortunately, after two years, the battery is failing to hold a charge, which is very surprising for a Li-Ion battery. Others have posted similar experience. And with a non-replaceable design, your choice is to buy a new one. If you don't want to have to buy a replacement every two to three years, I recommend some other vac with replaceable batteries.
1,I was so excited about receiving this chair, I literally just got it in the mail today, put it together and I'm already having problems. The screw hole for the top right arm is stripped, so I cannot tighten the screw and also the lever is not working to raise the chair up and down. Customer service (who was actually quite cooperative) is sending me a new back cushion, piston and seat plate. I am basically going to need to take apart and put this thing back together- Ugh! When everything arrives, if it all goes smoothly, I'll update my review. For $326 + tax, I should not need to do all this.
1,They look good size but are much bigger, now they are being used as spatulas !
1,Fell apart when I took it out of the box. Amazon would not take it back despite me being a Prime member. Disappointed all around.
1,not consistent
1,Terriable performance. The filter (sponge) dries out quickly and thus the humidity drops considerably. Solution is to buy the filters if they load with minerals. The issue is mine would have needed a new filter after 30 days in use. Unacceptable. Fortunately, there is a new unit available. Ill try it out but this one is unacceptable.
1,arrived broken. i had to return this product
1,does not really puree well...i decided to order a vitamix for all of the pureeing i do...
1,Cheap mold, sugar lace products won't work in these cheaply made molds.
1,I'm unfortunately very disappointed in the motor strength of this processor. We bought it as a replacement to our aging but still strong KFPM650 because it seemed to add some neat processing options. What I didn't know was that those options are really all this device has to offer. When we got it I was instantly a bit confused since the box with all accessories was as heavy as just the base of the old one... This foretold the frustrations that we would have in the coming months.		To date we have not used the dial a blade thing, only used the shredder attachments which we had with the 650. I make meatloaf, kofta kebabs, and some other meaty treats from time to time and this thing can't even handle a pound. The old one took 2 with little struggle. The motor just bogs down and shuts off on this one. What's worse is that even using one pound, the meat seeps its way up inside the blade gumming up the works even worse. So in order to do the last batch, I had to work with 1/3 pound batches.. that's sad. Lastly, the motor in this model is much louder than our older model and the base is lighter. When it gets going it sometimes bounces a bit on the counter unless I hold it firmly down.		Pros: Lots of blades and ways to get a neat-o veggie tray with it. Could likely blend soup.	Nice design for the dial a blade thing. Nice smaller work bowl.		Cons: Very weak motor, poor blade mount which allows product inside it when using, shakes quite a bit being so light.
1,The filter is hard to clean. The brush doesn't have a lot of torque, and will stop spinning when it hits fabric/carpet.
1,smells EXACTLY like the real candle but fades fast. Had to add a new cube too frequently.
1,I can't recommend this vegetable peeler because it's as dull as a stone!  Don't they sharpen these things at the factory?  It scrapes rather than cuts.		I gave it 2 stars because the handle is comfortable and if I'm able to sharpen the blades myself, it might become a decent tool.
1,Two stars because it made chair feel warmer but otherwise disappointing and deserving one star. I would describe my chair as average size and pocket tops barely reach top center of armrest making pockets unusable. Top has to be reattached after every use. There is no other means of attachment except at top. Material is thinner and more flimsy than I expected. And yes Dwight it is a Snuggle Up
1,I have no problems with the Foodsaver rolls ... those seem to work flawlessly. These pre-made bags, however, have been next to worthless. Perhaps I just received a bad batch but only about one out of every 5 bag will even begin to evacuate much less hold a seal. Those that do evacuate typical lose their seals after a while. I'm sticking with the rolls from now on.		One positive is that I can use the box these came in to store bags I've made from the rolls for later reuse. Other than that, these bags have been frustrating in the extreme!
1,These shoes were the right size but they were too narrow and gave my son blisters. He suffered his first few days of school with blisters because he loved these shoes so much. Now i have to find him a new pair.
1,White and black feathers keep exiting the fabric and feathers became such a problem, I had to throw it out.  I replaced it with a more senseable stuffing.
1,Was hoping this would work as a cool way to display greeting cards or photos but it just looks like a wirey mess.  Not something I want to look at every day.
1,Oh my goodness.. they are total garbage quality and don't work properly :( Totally disappointed.
1,Just had to return these beautiful cushions. They are made for Small kitchen chairs and are not  as plush (maybe two inches of pad after you sit on the cushion.  Additionally, the lovely fabric slides a great deal more than I anticipated.  My antique chairs have cane seating and are not slick.  However, even with the ties, the pillows move around far too much.  Rich, beautiful fabric, however.
1,Difficult to use.  Weve had this for quite a while and my husband complains every time he uses it. Dont know why I haven't replaced it but Im going to soon   probably because he uses it more than I do. It is awkward for both of us to use and it takes  fair amount of force to use. It also takes up a lot of storage space. Its the only time Ive been disappointed in an American test kitchen recommendation.
1,I've been buying and using T-Fal pans for years, but these are garbage. The coating has flaked off of almost every pan.	But worse, they are not great on my GE induction cooktop. The area of each pan bottom that is induction capable is MUCH smaller than the actual bottom of the pan, so I'm forced to use a MUCH smaller burner than the pan because the burners don't sense the pan and refuse to turn on. This makes cooking very difficult because several inches of the pan are hanging off the edges of the burner and the food only cooks in the center.	Our cast iron and other completely induction-capable pans have no issue with burner size.
1,Worked great for a couple of weeks and then the seem on the side broke. Its made of cheap material (a bit paper like) so it is impossible to fix :(
1,Nice size as I sell emu eggs and want to make clay emu egg ornaments. Ordered one. Got two. Very poorly packaged so one is totally bent and I threw straight in trash.
1,Update:  After 1 year I am very dissatisfied.  I was rolling the cart when one of the wheels must have hit a small obstacle.  Suddenly the entire cart fell to the side with all my things sitting on it breaking onto the floor.  I examined what happened and the 2 right wheels had been torn off the bottom.  The reason?  The manufacturer used low quality fibre board to attach the wheels to. Why they would use such nice solid wood throughout most of the unit but use fibre board on a critical infrastructure frame is just cheap.		*****		Looks great.  All parts are very high quality with one exception that I don't quite understand.  While nice wood is used throughout, the bottom of the drawers consist of what looks like thin high density fiberboard.  Maybe this will hold up over time against possible spills in the drawers or accidental overload of weight ... time will tell.  But I don't plan on putting much in the drawers anyway - it just seems that the use of this material is inconsistent with everything else about the product.  It took at 4.5 hours for me to put together.  I think I could have done it in 4 with an electric screwdriver.  When you get to the drawers part of the assembly, there are a lot of screws!  Please let me know if you found this review helpful.
1,Should have just spent the extra money to get the Wilton tips. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.
1,Cheesy, better for children's tooth brushes
1,I should've known this product and it's good reviews were too good to be true. The only reason I'm even giving it two stars instead of one is because it has a pretty shimmer to the fabric. I ordered these in ivory for my daughter's bedroom and they do not, I repeat, do not block our hardly any of the light in her one 32 inch wide window. I am extremely disappointed as the barely lines ones I bought at Walmart work better than these. The grommets at he top of the panels are bronze and wide and ugly. Not a fan of these at all. I wasted a lot of time and energy ironing these but I think I may still return because they're no better functioning and definitely not better looking than the cheap ones I already had up in my daughters nursery. If you're ordering these in ivory for room darkening purposes do not ware your time.
1,This attractive rug contains metal "burrs" and staples that I guess are part of the weaving process.  No way this works in any room I have.  Too bad!
1,Unfortunately, right out of the box the handle broke off.
1,It was terrible.  Returned it the day after it was received.  I wanted just a simple angel with long lasting white LED lights.  This is a fiber optic color changing one that is ugly in my opinion.  Description needs to be updated.  If you could turn off the color changing it would be okay, but you can't.  Amazon was great about the return though.
1,After studying the "instructions" or should I say looking at the pictures because there were no written instructions, I attempted to put this thing together.  It fell apart a couple of times and the last time the top slid down on my hand and cut my thumb wide open.  I would say this item is dangerous to say the least.  Top piece is still not on because now I can't do anything because of the terrible and I do mean terrible injury to my thumb.  The manufacturer should warn purchasers that this item can cause injuries.  The clamps which are really not clamps but 2 pieces of plastic that don't even snap together are flimsy and flew off the poles several times before I could get them into the frame.  I am very scared of this item and especially after paying over $100 for it I can not say how disappointed I am.  It is heavy and no telling what it would cost to ship it back.  So I am out of pocket big $$$$ for something I can not use.  As it IS HEAVY if it falls on someone it could really do more physical damage.  I doubt that all this will ever get to the company that sold it but this is the first time I have ever had any trouble with anything I have ever purchased from Amazon.  Just beware if you decide to buy this.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Nice and sturdy, easy to put together. looks really nice, didn't come damaged at all. Super cute!		*Update* 2 weeks after purchase the table cracked and had to return it. So sad, it was pretty but just not durable.
1,I bought this thinking it would be better than all the cheap supermarket spoon/spatulas.  It is worse - the head is not sealed to the handle and batter / food / grease / whatever gets in the slot where the head and handle connect and is impossible to get out - soaking, dishwasher on heat boost - nothing works.  Also, 400 deg limit is iffy when using on the stove - 600 deg limit is much better.  Mine curled a bit when used on the stove, but since it had a permanent reservoir of filth, I tossed it anyway.  Better to splurge on the ones from Pampered Chef.
1,*UPDATE* - I changed my review from 3 stars to 2 stars. As my original review stated the batteries lasted only 18 hours (6 hours per evening over 3 days). So I went out and purchased fresh new Sony batteries and had the same results - 6 hours per evening over 3 days and all but two of the lights were dead.  The other two made it a couple of hours on the fourth night before dying.  If you are buying these for a one time event then they'll probably meet your needs, but if you're like me and looking for a long term light to use a few hours each evening, then these won't work for you. They definitely do not last anywhere near the claimed 72 hours, even after replacing the batteries with brand new ones.		-----		I give the lights themselves 5 stars, but the batteries get zero stars. The description states batteries last 72 hours, mine barely made it 18 hours (3 evenings at 6 hours per evening). I purchased some new batteries which are working much better. While these are very decorative and nice beware that you'll need to replace batteries often and that factors in a much larger expense to these lights.		I really like the remote control feature of the lights and it is has quite a distance range, about 15 feet or so.		Also, I purchased the "warm white" color which in the picture has a more orangish glow to it, but these are definitely bright white white and not "warm" at all, still works well for what I am using them for though.
1,This cushion is nice for a car seat or a chair. I bought it because it said that it was also suitable for a wheelchair. Not so! It was too small for an adult wheelchair & sits back about 4 inches from the front of the wheelchair seat. I would not recommend it for an adult 16-inch wide wheelchair.
1,I bought a small ice pop set for $1 at Wal-Mart but since my kids love their frozen yogurt pops, decided to get this set since the molds are bigger. I had the Wal-Mart set for over a year and it only got a little wear & tear. Spent $8 on this set and in two months it's already breaking. So disappointed and mad! These don't come out of the molds any easier than other brands, but break too fast for the price. One of the molds cracked, and one if the colored top handles already broken in to sharp pieces. Down a whole pop. Would definitely not recommend. For what I paid compared to the Wal-Mart set. Just save your money!
1,Item was about 8 inches to short for what I needed it for but it would be a good item.
1,I did not heed the warning on the other review that noted a urine smell.  I will be honest the stick itself smells just ok.  When you light it it reeks of urine.
1,Kids lost my "good sissors" so I purchased these made by a company I trust (have a wonderful set of knives for 20 years).  However, I am really disappointed.  The sissors work fine but they just come apart way to easily.  I have a relatively small hand and if I open them up wide in order to cut something they just fall apart.....very frustrating.  I guess I will keep looking for an adequate replacement for the ones we lost, wish I could remember who made them.
1,the pin on the handle broke the second time i used it!
1,This slips all over the place! The backing is just little black dots that is still slippery!
1,OK, maybe my fault but I ordered this cab for toys.  Quality seems good - the color, however, is disgusting.  It is a poop brown.  I was disappointed so I decided to contact company to return for a Expresso finish one that I hoped would look better.  The company did agree to take it back - with a $25 deducted from return and I would have to pay to ship it back.  All I wanted was to exchange color.  I am very disappointed and feel like I am being held hostage because of the expense to return it and get the new one makes me feel like I just need to suck it up and keep the poop in the living room.  Not impressed with return options.  The color in the pic - looks great - it is NOT the color that arrives.  Buyer beware.		Update:  OK, I built the cabinet as I felt it wasn't cost efficient to return ... explanation above.  It is worse than I thot.  It is very cheap looking.  If I had paid $50 for this - it's fine.  But it's not fine for $130.  So, I will suck it up ... pay the ridiculous $25 to return it and the expense to ship it just to have it gone.  I will NOT be purchasing the expresso finish as it looks cheap - and color change won't help that.  I am very surprised by all the good reviews.  I bought based on them - and now am leery of trusting reviews.		Don't buy this cabinet unless it is greatly reduced in price and you don't care how cheesy it looks.
1,This is cute in theory but is hard to open and tips over very easy.
1,Update: the lid on one of the bowls just cracked. We don't have a dishwasher, always washed by hand, and haven't used too often or roughly. I was disappointed that it broke so soon. Also we had given up using the "dressing" container; way too likely to open and spill. We used for cheese or another topping, and used a separate dressing container inside packed with the salad.		I am very happy with these bowls. The dressing isn't the most secure or easy to use, but sometimes we just leave the dressing container inside this the salad.
1,After using 3 months, it stopped working. Sunbeam Customer Service says that I need to send the defected blanket AT MY COST, so they can repair it for FREE. It is not FREE if I have to spend for shipping the blanket back. I will not buy from Sunbeam again.
1,These are tiny. They are more for children than grown-ups. Very disappointed.
1,Poorly made. None of the baskets would sit level on the chains. I tried moving things around, but it would never sit straight. The actual chains were of different length and very inconsistently made. Different links of different length, no wonder it wasn't lining up. The baskets themselves were also bowed and crooked. The chains were poorly spray painted, with about half their surface area still being gray.		Frankly I'm shocked that this thing got any good reviews at all. Good reviews are probably fake. Move on and get something else, I'm returning this trash.
1,I bought this and think that it'll be a direct replacement for lower price than hoover brand filter. The filter material is not as good as a Hoover brand, which is understandable for the price. The major problem is fitment. IT DOESN'T FIT, TOO SMALL I'LL HAVE TO CUT IT. I don't feel like wait for another week or so to get a replacement. So what I did is, I put 4 cut line into the corners of the filter. That way the opening can be force into the holding cap.		I'm very unhappy about this. I won't blame the low quality material but at least it should fit. PS: I've TWO Hoover Foldaway vacuums. One is early model and one is late model. This filter WON'T FIT BOTH.
1,****I am changing my review to 1 star from 4 because the handle fell off today with no warning.  The kettle had two of the possible 6 cups so it was not even close to capacity and the handle separated from the kettle, hanging on only at the very bottom. Be safe choose something else! the kettle was less than a year old and used properly, no rough use at all. May 23, 2011****		 We have been using this daily for months. It is good for coffee, black tea and green tea, where precise temperature is important. Love it with the [...] Aeropress for coffee.		It did smell a bit when we first got it, but it is a good little machine, and the smell was gone after a few weeks.		It is easy to clean the hard water deposits, we do use filtered water but we have had to boil vinegar a few times to clean the deposits. Then just boil a few pots of water to clear the vinegar.
1,Doesn't work
1,Did not come in original sealed package as shown in pic. May have been used before.
1,Toast does not go all the way down to toast top to bottom
1,wHEN CLEANING FILTERS, CAN'T GET THEM O GO BACK INTO PLACE.
1,This set of curtains came without a hem at the bottom so it appeared to be unfinished. It actually is sewn at the bottom but no hem. I returned them as I felt that it wasn't acceptable for my home.
1,This is REALLY tiny.  READ the measurements before buying.
1,They were long in the fingers but narrow in the hand. They would split between the thumb and first finger every time. My hand is large but not extra large. They refunded my money $4.25 but it cost me $15.00 to ship back.....Not a good product but they did contact me the next day after my e-mail. A big waste and not as advertised IMO
1,Pretty cheap buy a little bit nicer for options
1,***UPDATE**** to my original review... I just entries with chicken today. I took one whole chicken- quartered, skinned and boned it... Put it in the freezer (for a few hours)....the outcome is unfortunately with the meat I experienced the metal coming off. Also it would not work with the small grate and once the hopper was no longer full for the pusher the remaining meat is just stuck. When you are buying $4 per pound for fresh (happy)  chicken you are only willing to try this once. I'm downgrading to 2 stars with the understanding that I'll make falafel again.... But won't try meat a second Rome [original review]didn't go into this product with super high hopes but found myself pleasantly surprised. I have so far only used this once and it actually wasn't meat... It was chickpeas making falafel. The suction cup works very well to hold it in place and I had no problems with this shifting. I used the smaller plate and it came a perfect consistency. I buy whole chickens from a local farm and will be making my own ground chicken next (and plan on slightly freezing first like the other reviews recommend). Keep in mind you need to have the right tool for the job you are doing. This is a fairly small, plastic, manually operated appliance. I anticipate it will continue to work well for me because I am working with small amounts in small batches. If you are working in large quantities... Like grinding a significant amount from hunting.... This is probably not a good fit. I've taken off a star because it is plastic and will likely not last forever and also because when grinding I did have some moments with the crank where I felt if I pushed it further it would break but that was remedied by back cranking a bit and then continuing forward. I found it fairly easy to take apart and chose to hand wash and allow to completely dry before storing. Be advised does not come with a catch dish either... You will need your own but I found a large Pyrex bowl worked just fine. I would recommend this to people doing small jobs in a home kitchen that don't mind the extra effort to hand crank.
1,I purchased one about 5 years ago and the plastic gear stripped despite careful use (lots of noise with nothing turning). I did not replace it right away.		A year ago, I bought another hoping the plastic gear issue was an isolated one. After only a few uses, the plastic gear stripped again rendering it unusable.		There is NO point to advertising a 200 watt unit if the parts are made of plastic.	I bought a Hamilton Beach model at Walmart for cheaper and it lasted longer.
1,Problems with the zipper itself quality was not very good. Ripped within three weeks.
1,The mixer is under-powered and even at the highest setting spins rather slowly. It does not work as well as my old (ten years or more) mixer. When making whipped potatoes, the wire mixers allow large chunks to go through unscathed.
1,The suction cups are not working. This thing refuses to stay put.
1,initially, it works very nicely - and my cookies are the same size.  updating my review - it broke wayy too fast.  the arm breaks off, and the spring falls out - never to be mended!
1,Purchased these as a lightening deal.  They are total crap. Two wouldn't hold air at all and the third reinflated on its own instantly. Super thin. Also purchased the Storage Genie brand on Amazon and they work a lot better.
1,This look good in the picture.....not even close. When I finally got it up it looks like a rocket ship with balls and decorations on it. Has absolutely no shape at all. Nothing like you see here. Put everything back in box and sent back. Save your money.
1,Not what we were looking for.  Very small.  Returned.
1,I should have read the negative review before buying these so-called magnets.  I threw them into the garbage.  They are actually printed on thin cardboard and they come with peel and stick light duty magnetic strips you are supposed to install yourself.  VERY disappointing waste of money.  I purchased them from the same seller on eBay.		I wish they would openly advertise they are actually the Johnson Smith Co. in Bradenton, FL.  That alone would have told me not to buy them.  They have been known for selling cheap crap novelty items for many years.  I was first disappointed by them over 50 years ago.  Well, they got me again! :(
1,Maybe I just don't get the hype about these pillows? This isn't adjustable & was just too big of a bolster and far too hard & unforgiving for my neck. I actually use it like a softer version of a foam roller, to stretch my back etc.
1,Clay pot came broken
1,My fault. Wrong size ordered
1,Not very pleased with these. I have other double wall mugs and they keep everything hot much longer than these do.
1,Specs of what was delivered did not match specs in the product description. I needed something small for cocktail making.
1,wasnt what i thought it was going to be.
1,In theory these are a great idea, so for the idea Im giving them 2 stars.  But these are made of the lightest, cheapest plastic, they only kinda sorta function. And they wouldnt fit on the hamging rod in our closet!		Nice idea, poor execution, thanks for the giggles, but this is a fail.  Thank goodness they are cheap!
1,did noserve my purpose. too tallt
1,Ordered one of these and at the same time ordered the Cutter Brand. This item does not compare to the Cutter Brand. Sure it has more ounces (28 oz) and is cheaper than Cutter (20 oz) but take my word for it the Cutter Brand runs rings (mosquitoes hate it) around the Tiki Bucket. Cutter's Citronella is strong...Lamplight TIKI is a VERY light/mild Citronella. Down here in South Louisiana we know mosquitoes (they are as big as horse flies). Cutter does the job of keeping them completely away from the outdoor area.
1,This was not the oven shown in the picture Was disappointed with this order. would not recommend this to anyone Price was to high for this oven. Could have bought one at a local walmart for a much less price and returned if not the right one.	Would not recommend this oven, price is to high.	Buyer beware.
1,It's pretty and the colors are good but it is way too thin and the rubber backing doesn't hold very well to my hardwood floors.  I had a rug in that spot before so I know there is nothing on the floor to make it slip.
1,<div id="video-block-R2ZGLOUWS9R68Q" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B19RMJ00ylS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KJ6ZKWsRS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;This fan has great features (8 speed settings!), but unfortunately suffers from poor quality materials and therefore is NOT worth the money.  I have owned this fan for a little over a year (just long enough for the warranty to expire) and it is now shot.  The fan bearings are worn out.  As you can hear in the video, the fan now makes a loud grinding noise when in use.  It is useless to me now.		I have used this fan mainly while sleeping, running it at the lower speed settings and without oscillating.  I am very disappointed, and will look to another (better quality) brand to replace this thing.
1,The apple side worked well. It was easy to get the cut out pieces off the cutter and use them on the crust, but the leaf side doesnt work as well. Its too intricate and the dough doesnt come off or cut easily. Youre better off getting small cookie cutters for leaf shapes.
1,For about the same amount of money, just about any of the tongs on amazon.com will do better for you. I like my tongs on the lighter side, but these are ridiculous. These are very flimsy, and buckle with hardly any pressure. I can't imagine trying to pick up a roast with these. I returned them immediately for a refund.
1,Bought these to try the pot lid hack behind the cabinet door in the kitchen. I guess my lids have wider lips because these hooks were too small. My search continues.
1,came dented AND door was on crooked		Returned. Cheaply made.
1,Came damaged. The finials are made of thin ceramic and are easily broken. The rods came in a loose tube box without any reinforcement or cushioning. Consequently, three of the six rods that I ordered came with finials that were cracked and chipped. Most of the rods came with the finials  scratched or scraped. The rods are easily separated when extended and lose a great deal of structure integrity when extend to its fullest. The built quality is horrendous. I used these rods on a light sheer fabric and there is a substantial amount of deflection despite being only 36" wide. The rods appear as advertised in the picture in form, but not don't be fooled that you are going to get a decent quality rod. Construction is poor. Materials are cheap. These are not durable. Walmart/Target has rods on clearance that are significantly better. Save your money and DO NOT BUY. I'm using the rods in a rental property, otherwise I would not have bought them.
1,The color is NOT BLACK. Do not be fooled by "Estate Black", it is more like an espresso brown look. Not at all what we wanted, and it costs almost as much as the shelf itself to ship it back. Worst purchase ever.
1,I just reviewed another handheld. That was awful too. This one is just as awful. We had to toss it after just a few weeks because it broke.
1,Don't waste your money. This device will run for about 10 minutes on a full charge; hardly worth the effort.
1,Ended up throwing it away. I bought a queen size but while attaching it to the bed, the ruffles came apart and the elastic stretched out and broke. The fabric was very flimsy.
1,after 2 hours of using this, the immediate area is completely wet. I had to return it.
1,Did not remove wrinkles
1,Not what I wanted.
1,I am not convinced that these are real Palo Santo wood. I have used palo santo a lot and when I opened this bag there was not a strong smell at all. So I took a piece of wood out and burned it. No strong smell. I had a friend over and even she questioned if it was real.  It also lit very quickly and usually with palo santo in the past I had issues keeping it lit. I would not recommend this product. With 133 reviews and 4 stars I thought I had a good chance compared to others I looked at.		Please keep looking. I gave it two stars cause the shipping was quick.
1,Unit says it is good for spaces up to 500 cubic feet, and after doing the math, determined that my bathroom was about 450 cubic feet, so I gave it a shot. There is absolutely no discernible difference. The crystals change from blue (dry) to pink (wet) in about 7-10 days (much fewer than the 4-8 weeks advertised). Obviously, my bathroom is more humid than this thing can handle, and I will be purchasing a "real" dehumidifier because my entire basement apartment needs to dry out, especially going into winter.		Also, the unit gets very hot when plugged in to dry out. Yes, there is a warning that it "may" get hot, but I don't like leaving it plugged in when I leave the house. The only plus is that it makes exciting snapping noises when it's plugged in, and my cats perch around it, watching it intently when it snaps. Otherwise, I get absolutely zero use out of this. It would probably be good for a very small area, like a small closet, or a safe, but definitely nothing the size of 500 cubic feet unless the humidity is already quite low.		Also also, it came with an enormous S hook, apparently so I could hang it from somewhere (like a closet rod or a shower bar??), but there is nowhere on this unit to attach the S hook.
1,This is very thin and does not really rest down onto the carpet.
1,I bought this item as a stop-gap until I found a more long term black out curtain, and was very disappointed. This item is made of what seems like black construction paper, that at best blocks out 60% of daylight, and the top inch and a half or so is the sticky portion, that for me, half the blinds stayed up the whole night, and the other half fell (and made a lot of noise on the way down).		To sum up a short review, it's a half black out where only half of the papers will stay on the wall.
1,so sad:  these DO NOT fit into the stackable ClosetMaid shelving system: check the inches;  the Windsor set of six  DOES and fits perfectly.
1,These cups are poor quality. I have no idea where the term 'restaurant quality' comes in to apply to these cups. If I went to a restaurant using these I would immediately leave. These are not heavy or durable. They're one step above Solo brand plastic cups. My package of them arrived with the majority of them being scratched up and I'm not sure how long they'd hold up in anyone's dishwasher. If you believe these are GOOD cups, then you're probably replacing your collection of fast food and big gulp cups with them. Seriously, why would anyone buy these.
1,so sorry but this is flimsy at best
1,Hard to work and clean- not worth it
1,It's just a very cheaply-made silicone sleeve. Glitter flakes off and the logo is poorly stamped on the side. I wouldn't order again.
1,Stinks
1,Heavy duty?  This product is flimsy and the zipper tab snapped off when I tried to zip the cover on my futon mattress.
1,This french press makes great coffee, looks elegant, and is easy to clean (if you are reasonably careful about the glass). However, it has a major design flaw: the handle is connected to the frame at the bottom by a thin strip of metal which runs through a slot; because this metal is under torque every day, eventually it will fatigue and fail, and when that happens you're going to end up with a pot full of coffee all over the floor or (if you're less lucky) all over you. It took 4 1/2 years for this to happen to ours, so you'll get good use out of it; just be aware that it will eventually fail.
1,Got this and gave it for a Christmas gift to find the cords do not fit the port into the blanket. Unusable and had to return. Pictures do not match product
1,Not liking it at all
1,It worked well for a year but then 1 after another the blades stopped working.  down to 1 now.  disapointed
1,I bought this for my son-in-law who is a culinary student.  It burned after one use and he exchanged it. I do not know which other he got so I can not recommend an alternative.
1,This is the worst. I pours out. Not just leaks but pours. Not great for a one year old who thinks its funny to do so. Waste of money.
1,Not strong enough ripped immediately.
1,I used what I thought was this exact same knife to carve a turkey - it was a dream come tru so I bought one. It doesn't seem to be the same even though it looks the same and was the same model number. It does cut but just doesn't feel or perform like the one I used.
1,Too warm. Feels cheap. I upgraded to down a few months later but at nearly 5x the cost so i suppose you get what you pay for....
1,Looks very nice and made very well, but it looks nothing like the picture! It's much lighter and more muted tan with gray, not black and gray.
1,Filters water very slow, even after flushing the filter cartige.
1,They look like cheap goods, bad zipper and poorly made.....would never buy it again.
1,We returned these sheets as soon as they arrived. The color of the sheets in person was WAY different than pictured online. The blue-gray was much more bright blue.
1,When I opened this box, I thought this plastic was the disposable plastic used in packaging to hold the product in place. I was surprised to find that this flimsy, bendy plastic was the product itself. What a piece of crap. This is specifically called heavy-weight and heavy-duty; both descriptions are bald-faced lies.
1,Very cute and looks just like picture, but the seam came apart as soon as I tried to put the pillow in. I'm going to have to hand stitch it back together.
1,The plunger assembly on the SAN model is not 3-piece stainless steel.  It seems to have a fabric mesh with plastic and silicone.  I'm sending this one back!
1,It was hard to use and it smelled bad after use.  Make sure you pull a part and clean thoroughly.
1,Not a bad teapot, however it very annoying to use. You have to pull the plug out of the wall to turn it off which is dangous. So don't use it and forget you turned it on because it will never turn off. Don't waste your money. Get one with a safety cut off and one where you can turn it off and on without unplugging it.
1,I got this item to match my new kitchen cabinets - which it does. However the unit had no feet on the bottom and the small pole's  nut and bolt extended underneath the base' which is not good for the work surface. I had to put some rubber feet on the base and it works, but this should have been done by the manufacturers. For the price I won't complain too much although I will later get a more expensive one'
1,Very cheap and my door would not close, this was returned same day i got it :-(
1,This wasn't nearly powerful enough to do the job. Tried it on a wall and had to use too much 'elbow grease' so that it wore down the cheap brush attachment on the nozzle. A plain brush did much better. Returned the item.
1,soooo small
1,Not as described in adverdisment was displeased with this item.
1,Since I left my old iron in the house I plan to rent out, I finally decided to spend some loot and get a nice iron.  I'd wanted a Rowenta for years, so I took advantage of the rare opportunity to get what I want without hearing the hubby's mouth.		So I purchased this refurbished Rowenta DW9081 Steamium directly from Amazon.  It arrived quickly but on the first time I attempted to use it, it leaked like something I could use to water plants.  Seriously...it was that bad.  I filled it up with water being careful not to overfill the reservoir, then walked away to wash my face while the iron heated.  When I got back, nearly every drop of water had leaked out onto my ironing board and the floor.  Having paid nearly $100 for a REFURBISHED iron, I was quite angry and very disappointed.		After contacting Amazon for a return, I figured maybe I should just bite the bullet and get a new one.  So I did.  $142 later and the new one can't get out of auto shut down mode.  It just will not heat up no matter how many times I unplug and plug it in.		Now I can't see the logic of buying a third Rowenta.  I had much better luck with $40 irons than I've had with this so-called "top-of-the-line" $142 P.O.S.  Fuhgeddabouddit...No more Rowentas!
1,Ordered a yellow and pink.  Immediately I noticed the yellow one had way more sand in it, so I set a timer and timed them both.  The pink one ran out in 2min and 37sec.  The yellow one took 3min and 13sec to run out.  So much for a 2 minute timer.  Junk.
1,I figured Wilton would have made the hearts just a little bigger so you could fit the same amount of batter per heart to match what size normal cupcake/muffin pans hold. Don't buy for cupcakes. Will say they delivered fast.
1,Although the product came on time it came in a cardboard box that was not very sturdy.	It works, the electrical cord is not very long so you must use an extension cord to reach places that are more than 5 feet away. The squeege attachment was broken when received but the company requires you to send back the entire order (which you pay for) and they return another product and attachments. I did not think this was necessary when all I needed was a squeege attachment which would have been less expensive to return not all the parts.	I recommend the Dirt Devil hand held steamer if you want a longer cord.
1,It looked so great but the design and quality are poor. If you set it on the pan the wrong way it melts the black plastic on the hinge. The hinge is also not tight enough and it flips closed on me constantly. Lastly, one of the two resting pieces broke off. I only used it occasionally and did not abuse it.
1,The product would have been a quality product however it arrived full of stains. For the price it isn't worth sending it back. Really wished it would have been worth ordering.
1,Let me start by saying that it came in a box that was three size bigger than the product's package. Horrible packaging. I tested it on tile and I was not impressed. It didn't scrub as advertise and even small spots of dust remained after going over them. I understand the concept of the product but I'm not sure the matches the execution
1,It worked great for 3 months then it started reporting bad temps.  I checked it with ice which it reported at 108  With boiling water it was 325  Both probes reported the same numbers.  If it had not stopped working I would have given this 4 stars as it works great but the LCD display is hard to read at times.  Now it's just junk!  (in the photo the probe is not touching the bottom of the pan)
1,These are very flimsy. I am returning them. The are so jammed together when they arrived I was unable to separate them with out damaging the rim. Awful product. They are NO WAY comparable to Tupperware!!!'
1,Parts missing. Shorted on screws and washers. I had to go to two hardware stores to find the right screws and washers to put this together. Instructions a joke. For a first time user of an electric skillet, no explanation on how to use the controller. Large box before the 200 degg. mark. Whats it for? Not one recipe provided. Internet has recipes available for Westbend, Cuisinart, Oil Clad, Bella, etc. But not one recipe for Procter Silex.	Update. Just made chili. There is 1/4 turn before 200 deg. mark. Light comes on at about 150 deg. No mark there. Also, have read this is plain glass cover. Not tempered. Makes crackle and popping noises every time you lift and lower the lid. Is this temp. change going to shatter the glass? Lid is very heavy for me. I'm handicapped, wife had to help with this. As said picking up lid to stir very heavy and awkward for me.
1,I bought this for myself to try. I had hoped to like it so I could purchase another one for my Mother for Mothers Day. I baked my first angel food cake today & I was very disappointed. I tried every method I could to cut a neat slice of cake to no avail. As it didn't come with any instructions, I guess I surely did something wrong. As the tips look like nails, nails are blunt & I should have known that a blunt nail could not penetrate a cake delicately. My misjudgment. I am disappointed cause I would have purchased several as gifts if it had worked for me.
1,these suck they do not lock returning them,
1,These lights didn't even last for a full year.
1,I just received it so I can't speak to how effective this product is (I guess I won't know unless my daughter starts having fewer breathing difficulties and even then... "clean air" is rather subjective) but I can say this much, having just received the project: it ships in a cardboard box (not retail packaging) and it says NO WHERE that it is a HEPA filter or even that it is an "air purifier." The only label it uses on both the box and the owner's manual is "allergen reducer." I bought this unit because my daughter's doc said to get a HEPA filter and this listing says the product has a HEPA filter. Now that it arrives, I can tell it obviously doesn't have HEPA or it would say so. It makes zero claims to do anything other than the vague reference to "reduce allergies." All I smell is a scam.
1,Very poor quality. It looks like a print out from an 80's Atari game.
1,This unit stopped working after 2 weeks so I decided to open it up and see if I could identify the problem. The first thing I notice is how UTTERLY CHEAP this unit is made. It is obvious once you see inside that the manufacturer does not care. It is not made to last and if you open yours you will also be shocked at the piece of junk this product is. You will be better off finding a better quality negative ion generator. Seriously, this thing is pure junk.
1,Couldn't get it to work.
1,It works I bought coffeeDucks (reloadable coffee capsules ) for this Nespresso You need about 3-4 capsules to make a decent size  cup of capacinno if you would use there own capsules it would cost $$$$$$ lots don't buy
1,really, really, really poor quality. The flowers come off... 50% of them! Nothing realistic in there.
1,Even with the lid on, and fastened, when juicing with fruit, such as oranges or pineapple, it not only splatters but the juice leaks out through the seal.		Not impressed, but will continue to use.
1,Some came with a big cut in the balloon. Amazon only refunded me for the faulty ones - which ultimately didn't help me because I couldn't use only a few letters anyway.
1,When we received the towel mats, there were some small snags on them so we sent them back.  They are thin like an inexpensive towel.  Our regular bath towels are of better quality so we did not like them. They will work ok if you want a lightweight towel mat that will dry quickly.
1,These sheets from Superior are actually very comfortable, I've very much enjoyed these sheets, the way they feel, the smooth softness etc and I'd like to buy many more sets for all my properties. In February 2017 I got a queen set for 44.60 and now they are selling for well over 140!		These sheets are some of the most comfortable sheets I've ever owned for the price; However I don't feel comfortable getting price-gouged when they were once available for less than 50. If a seller drops the price to 50 or less do yourself a favor and get a set or two. Otherwise, don't get ripped off. They are worth 50 and nothing more.
1,This blanket does not get very hot and the elements are only in the middle, so about 12 inches on each side have no heating quality at all.  I bought this to cover myself on the couch and stay warm.
1,Not adequate even for a small bedroom, laundry room or bathroom. Next I tried a Frigidaire FFAD7033R1 70-Pint Dehumidifier "WOW" works perfectly in every environment I've tried including a 40 foot shipping container that would literally rain inside during cold rainy weather out-side now is dry as a bone.
1,Clock looks great! Just wish it worked. Tried three different NEW batteries in it. Can't seem to get it to work
1,I purchased this bed a few months ago because mine was breaking and I needed a replacement ASAP. Its quite pretty. It's sturdy, and although it took some time to assemble, it was a relatively easy process. I'd definitely recommend it.		Edit: I've had this bed for less than a year. It creaks, and the slats are snapping. No warranty or seller contact. Very disappointed.
1,The keypad was defective out of the box.  Up until this time I have always had Sharp microwave ovens.  However I am very disappointed the the poor quality control and I will be looking at other brands.  I am returning this turkey.
1,Bought this from amazon to keep hot water handy whenever I would need it. I fill it with boiling hot water at about 8 at night and even the next day after noon when I checked the water was still the way it was filled the previous night. What a great product. I also filled it with warm water, warm enough for me to pour a glass and drink it immediately. Same result. Over 12 hours later the water was just as warm. One night I had left the cover half open hoping that the boiling hot water will cool a little just the way I wanted it to. But nothing apparently happened and the hot water stayed hot until I checked the following day. I have not used this for coffee, so I can't comment on that.	This is my first Zojirushi brand purchase. It's made in Japan which was also a plus as I know that products made in japan are hard to come by and are very high quality. I have no issues with the cap either as it is very well sealed all around so there's no condensation build up. Easy to clean and it looks great on the counter top.
1,I didn't get to use these. The box showed no signs of damage. Upon opening the box and going to unwrap the first candle I had seen that it was completely smashed (4" pillar). The large pillar had hairline cracks in the top of the candle (was afraid that it would break it I finished unwrapping it). Definitely not worth the $23. They are way to fragile.
1,Under limited use the battery lasted 15 months
1,We tried these on our standard size shower curtain rod.  They get stuck, keep falling off of the rod and are generally  a nuisance.  I have ordered the heavy duty roller type curtain rings and expect to be happy with those:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Heavy-Duty-Polished-Chrome-Roller-Shower-Curtain-Rings-Set-of-12-RollerRingsTM/dp/B00017UT6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Heavy Duty - Polished Chrome Roller Shower Curtain Rings - Set of 12 RollerRingsTM</a>
1,Don't waste your money. This container is cheaply made and very flimsy. I will spend a few dollars more for a more substantial container with an airtight lid.
1,The thread count is too low.  Its kinda scratchy as a result.  And the zipper is kinda sharp and snags on my foot sometimes.  I will pay more for a better cover next time.
1,It's great for about 6 months, and then it goes downhill from there, with the non stick surface wearing off. I used it for a year before throwing it out.		Basically it's a cheap, supposedly healthy, non stick pan that will last less than a year.		I guess it's priced right but I still feel like given how careful I was to wash it and keep it in good condition it should have lasted longer. I mean I wasn't expecting an heirloom but I still expected it to last a couple years.		Also, if you try to use max heat on this pan or leave the heat on too long it will scorch the non stick surface and immediately ruin the pan as you see with some of the other reviews... If careful it will probably last you 6 months to a year.
1,Not anything like the real red crystal
1,I have a shedding golden retriever and while this comb was nice on her fur, it works just like a regular comb and doesn't actually change anything except now there is additional cost involved.
1,not good at all.  wrong size
1,. The problem was that they tore the first time they were used? The fit and ease of use were good, except for tearing.
1,I think this one is fake. The ice melts after a few hours and the lid does not fit right. It leaks when you drink out of it. Do not buy this!
1,Tried the quick fix fabric shades, thought these would be similar. The fabric shades have been up and wonderful for the past 3 weeks. The paper shades have fallen off of multiple windows, don't stick well, and feel exactly like paper. Wouldn't recommend, esp over the fabric.
1,Bought this in February and it died in October. I see I'm not the only person whom this iron lasted 8 or less months for.
1,Very cheap..don't set them down unless it's on a pillow or they will break!!
1,Could not tell you how this performed. Received one damaged. One side was bowed out, but did not take a picture. Received the replacement and this one was damaged too. I took pictures of this one. Not sure who is to blame. Shipping box was not damaged, but there was not any padding or anything in the box with the pan.
1,** UPDATED **	I recently ended up returning it back to Costco after having it for 13 months as the unit broke. I do not recommend this specific brand and unit as reliability is horrible. Quality isn't there either as the COLD was no where near COLD like other water dispensers. It was very noisy and much louder than other brands too. Now I am in search for a replacement and it will not be this brand and and unit that's for sure.		** ORIGINAL POST **	I purchased this exact Hamilton Beach water dispenser at Costco ([...]). It has nice 3 way dispensing (Hot/Room Temp/Cold) but the big flaw is the Cold is NOT COLD as it should be. It is COOLER than Room Temp but definitely not COLD. I though it might have been a defect for those who said the similar things but to realize it might be just design flaw. I have just replaced my previous bottom loading 2 way water dispenser and that cold water was COLD (nowhere near this junk). I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND this product.
1,Unfortunately you get what you pay for.  I bought two of these in different patterns.  This one that I received is the right pattern but not in the colors shown.  The other one I bought in a completely different pattern, which I'll review next, is exactly the same (so I received to pillowcases that are the exact same pattern and are not in the right color).	Came international mail from China or somewhere.	Inexpensive and cheap.  Ok, for the price though.
1,I ordered these to replace the beaters I bent from my Mixmaster. Be sure you read the model # on your mixer before ordering. They do not fit all Mixmaster mixers. Cheaply made.
1,While the packaging was fine and obviously not the cause of concern, this product appears to be fairly cheap. Upon opening, both a lid and a container were already cracked and broken. Very disappointing .
1,This item has the worst design you can imagine. If power end or fail with a cork half way  the inner channel , you will never charge it again, nor you can un-screw the cork inside it.
1,I have some successes and some failures with this. It does NOT work well with frozen things (i.e., ice, frozen bananas, frozen fruit). The motor just whirrs and whirrs and doesn't incorporate the ingredients at all. It seems to work better  when I've used fresh fruit, almond or soy milk, no ice. Generally disappointed and a waste a money (even though it was inexpensive - but as another reviewer wrote, "you get what you pay for.")
1,Not impressed
1,If I could choose no stars, I would. And I have a lot of experience with this companies machines.	I actually haven't written a review before because Ive got so much going on with three businesses it frustrates be to be in a position with such a high ticket item that if I do write a review, it will be as long as the other unhappy reviewers HONEST one listing all of the issues they have had (and I have had the same and more). I have a Z5 and it is my THIRD Jura machine. I bought it at Williams-Sonoma.	I have NOT had three because I have had a good experience and have loved this machine. In fact it is the opposite. It is because each machine I have had has malfunctioned terribly and aside from the "smaller" issues of having to reach in and wipe it clean with your hand and try resetting error codes yourself based on their minimal help by phone, the machines have had to be returned. Each time this happened, it was just the stores "good luck" that the model was no longer available through them (I am talking about barely a year after buying the model). They always had the next newest model and I ended up stuck each time with two choices: either upgrade to the newer model and pay the difference (never less than $600 more for the next model) or take store credit, of a couple thousand dollars. I do not need store credit for that much money and always just needed a very reliable machine, so I always ended up paying the difference and walking out with another model.	My Z5 malfunctioned a week ago. I have tried everything to get it to work, it will not send water through the system in the right places. When I ask it to make coffee, it puts out hot water. When I ask it to make espresso, it just won't. When I ask for Hot water, I get NOTHING. It will not froth milk.	I called the company and they claim there is an internal error that they need to repair. My choices are to either send it to them (and it is a BIG item to ship) for repair at over $300 and they'll send it back with a 90!!! day warranty, or I can UPGRADE to the newer model and pay the huge difference! I am NOT doing this a fourth time. This company appears to make products that are destined to fail and require lots of service and they make out by making the service prices so high and the warranty such a joke that they get people to pay the price for the next model. I went into Williams Sonoma yesterday to see what they had to offer in other brands. It turns out the manager told me they stopped carrying the Jura products because there were continuous problems and too many unhappy customers. I wish everyone could know this, owning a Jura machine has caused nothing but disappointment, frustration, down-time without home brewed espresso resulting in trips out in the morning to Starbucks, and a TON of extra money. Terrible product, company seems to have quite a scam going.
1,I bought this for my mom for Christmas and I wish I would have seen her sooner because I would have returned it but now it's too late. Absolute garbage! It's like trying to cut on a piece of paper. It slides all over the counter top. There's WAY better products out there. Do not buy this! My money went in the trash do not let yours go to the same place. It's absolute rubbish
1,The desk came in good shape. We carefully put it together. It took 3 hours. We did a good job. But the bottom drawer tracking mechanism is not on track so the drawer only opens half way. The surface of this product is super cheap. I walked into a corner and the top piece just separated. The bottom corner did the same thing with just a sock touching the bottom. I am afraid to actually use it because it seems that the surface will just scratch or if you hit a corner it will chip off.	I now have a rug on the desk top and baby safety corners on the edges so maybe it will stay in OK shape. I purchased this to make my craft room look nice but it looks junky now.	Not sure if Amazon.com LL can do anything because the desk is 135 pounds and already put together. I will post a photo of the corner protector I am using  and desk top rug. This is a new product that has not even been used yet and it is already fragile. I am now gun shy to purchase anything that is larger due to not being able to return it easily.	I usually try to be positive about my purchase ratings and I did try to figure out a way to contact the seller directly regarding this but could not figure out how to reach out to them directly.
1,Did not like this, you get what you pay for.
1,Impossible to clean without soap taste and residue. Tried vinegar and lemon juice but nothing removed the taste. Muffins, cupcakes all tasted like soap. Very disappointed :(
1,I was excited to get these as it's hard to find Hot  Pink sheets.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give them a try. But all I can say is YUCK!.  First off, they came with the standard cardboard inside to keep them looking nice in the package but it also had a hidden treasure of two pieces of cardboard with plaster between them!  What????  I can only think it was to make the package feel heavier than it is so you think they are better quality?  Pieces of the plaster were on the sheets as whenever this plaster board was made, the plaster oozed out of the ends so it's crumbly.  I should have taken a picture of it.  I've never seen anything like it.		Second, they are THIN.  They are this flimsy fabric I've never encountered before.  Sure they are soft but they also feel rubbery.  I decided to wash them and see if they  would hold up to the washing machine.  Some color came off (used a color catcher sheet).  Not too bad.  The dyer tough, the lint trap was FULL of bright pink fluff.  I've washed many sheets in my time and never saw so much fluff/lint before.		Lastly, there is not one place on the sheets tags or the packaging that tells you the content of the sheets.  I know on the Amazon page above it says "microfiber" but why isn't that on the sheets or package?  Why hide that info?		I can not recommend these sheets to anyone and I wouldn't.  If you don't mind thin, rubbery feeling polyester ...then these are for you.
1,Good luck, I have had nothing but problems with mine. It spends most of it's time spinning in circles. If not, it is stuck, on, up, or under something. Major dissapointment! Tech support has been weak at best. There seems to be no where you can send it for repair or evaluation. I have never put it in to any room and had it work. I have followed all Roomba's tips and still nothing. Think long and hard on this one. My "regular" vacuum is far more dependable.
1,Looks like cast iron in the photo,but it's thin aluminum or pot metal with a non-stick coating sprayed on. Not recommended.
1,for shelf paper it is ok but nothing else.
1,Product is great and I already had 2 sets which I very much liked. Love the design and size.		This is the third set I order and it arrived with one of the bowls broken. Very disappointed.
1,Man, I don't like this. Got a set for my wedding registry and every time i use it i regret that i didn't get another one =(	can't fry anything on the frying pans... you need tons of oil, otherwise everything will stick to it... i ruined a couple dishes already... sucks...	i gave 2* bc the pots are pretty good. well, there're just regular pots...
1,not at all what I expected. I hesitate giving this review but as soon as I opened it and smelled the ink smell I had a feeling it was going back.
1,The bed slabs were so easy to bend and the bed very dangerous because it was unstable.
1,I won't buy any more Black and Decker products.  Every one of their products has been a miserable failure.  I have finally learned my lesson.
1,Sent it back
1,Instructions are all NOT in english...far too small for my needs anyway, but found it weird that even the box writing wasn't in english.
1,I ordered 4, and none of them came the same. The color were different from each tube (one came gray, the other one like a black, the other one like bronze) and even the design is different. One of the tube cover says China and the other ones don't (and I would have preferred that says nothing at all).		My husband was mad at me because the work done here was poor, and I could have just go to an Hardware Store and do it myself.
1,Really wanted a glass kettle and like the measurements on the side. Has a quiet whistle and very easy to clean. Black plastic handle gets very hot and requires a pot holder to touch to pour our water. Unfortunately, after just 3 weeks of proper use on a gas stove, despite removing the pot promptly after the whistle, the lid melted all over the side of the pot. Such a shame.
1,Worked perfect the first couple of times.  Wife made my boys some waffles yesterday and all of them started to stick on the top.  Not sure what the deal is.  For a no stick item it should work more than a couple times without sticking just sayn.
1,It is terrible, very rough and uncomfortable, gets very warm.  The material is terrible.
1,I purchased these extra 5 replacement clothes to use with the steamer I bought. After the first time I used one it ripped.  I have not tried the other clothes yet.  It is a disappointment.  I will not buy this product again nor would I recommend them to a friend.
1,Love the idea, but after a while they just stopped working. It would stream out oil instead of spray it. Also the bottle got greasy so it was difficult to pump. its easier to just brush on olive oil.
1,To start with, the box had been smashed, then re-taped. The wall hanging is really horrific. It was filthy, as if someone went out to dig it out of a barn! The paint is chipped and not just in one place. Whatever this item was previously, it was white in color. The colors are not vibrant, in fact very dark. Eye catching is not the term I would use to describe this. Back it goes!
1,This was unusually skinny & the appliques were not put on very well. I returned it
1,These both broke very soon after I got them. Terrible quality.
1,Doesn't stay in place, difficult to get hair out of, and gets mildewed quickly.  This was one of many "solutions" we tried, before finally settling on a TubShroom, which is far superior in stopping hair from going down a drain.  Don't waste your money.
1,These are not the heavy melamine cups sold elsewhere on Amazon.  I ordered them by mistake and was shocked to find ordinary disposable cups glued to the stems.
1,I bought this product based on all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, this thing just does not work.  You can't use the transmitter separately from the receiver.  My units never synced up, so I was unable to use it.  If it had worked, I would still be disappointed in the product.  The battery compartment for the transmitter opens differently than the receiver, there are no instructions on how to open it, and it is not intuitive (I ended up using a flat head screwdriver to pop it open).  Also, I have a wall oven without a counter on the side.  I have owned many other probe thermometers in the past and they have all included magnets on the back of the unit that connects to the probe.  If I could have gotten this to work, I would have needed to attach magnetic stripping to the back of the unit.  Finally, the plastic used to house both units seems of low quality - whatever you do, don't drop one of the units.  Sorry but I have to send this item back.
1,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AMW-13-Digital-Postal-Kitchen-Scale/dp/B002SVQHH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AMW-13 Digital Postal/Kitchen Scale</a>&nbsp;In process of returning!  Was excited to start a new project and this did not function when I received it. Mode button did not work and calibration button on bottom of scale did not function. I purchased from Clicks NYC... Disappointing. Ordered another brand - we'll see...
1,Nice to the touch, very soft but very thin and wearing quickly!!!
1,Thought I finally find the right travel neck supportive pillow but unfortunately another failed design.  The flat back is great and the little neck back support but the sides do not provide any neck support so your head will just flop over either sides.
1,Look at the description..."Circulon 2 8-Inch Open French Skillet", which clearly suggests there are two skillets for sale.  But when my shipment arrived, there was only one skillet.  I called the company, and was told cheerily, "Yes, lots of people are confused by that."  Well, I guess so!  Now that the company knows about the confusion, why do they continue to list it in this "confusing" way?  Additionally, why does Amazon permit them to go on doing so?
1,There are two packages of silicon beads that get packed into the inside of the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DHP-Emily-Convertible-Futon-Vanilla/dp/B005FKMVN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DHP Emily Convertible Futon,Vanilla</a>. I know this because I ended up tearing open the back and found them stapled to the inside.

Those in turn started to leak into my house. At first I had no idea where they were coming from. So I put the futon in the garage for later, when I would have more time to investigate.		Fast forward to today and I open her up from behind and she's all full of beads! Beads everywhere!!! blarg!		Other than the beads it is a pain in the bum to move due to the hinges and the general way it is set up.
1,no smell at all to them
1,This model blade evoured the coupler teeth on my KSB3 blender. So now I hove to buy a new coupler, or give up and throw tho whole contraption away.		Returns are allowed, but you pay the postage, which is 75% the price of the item so what's the point?
1,This really is a pretty expensive piece that takes up a lot of room, but it's really not that useful to me. I'm sorry I rushed into buying it and didn't act quickly enough to return it.
1,I am re-editing my review. As of almost 3 weeks later... and maybe 4-5 uses at the most... and the wine doesn't even make it into the cup when I attempt to pour it. It comes out the side... and just one side. I've tried screwing it in as much as I can, but that just doesn't work. I'm thoroughly disappointed. This went from 5 to 2 stars. If you purchase this product and it happens to hold up, then what I described below is exactly what you'll experience... and it will definitely be 5 stars. Sigh.		Pros: Actually Does Work!, Comes with Cute Bag (Holder), Pump To Take Air Out Of Wine	Cons: None As Of Yet		I was extremely excited to get this item in the mail. I absolutely love the taste of wine red wine. I swear, one day I will have a 1,000-2,000 bottle wine cellar in my basement. I love assessing the flavors and ingredients in each wine and my close friends enjoy the same thing. I decided to get this particular wine aerator for that purpose.		I do have a couple wine aerators but this one takes the cake. I notice a difference in the taste of my wine when compared to the other aerators that I have. I also like the fact that this aerator is sleek and small. I have a larger aerator (that goes on top of the wine glass), and I didn't particularly like it.		I like the fact that this aerator fits right into the wine bottle, so you and/or your guests/family can continue pouring throughout the night. This particular product comes with an air pump. What is that exactly, you say? Well, its designed to pump the air out of the wine bottle and keep the taste of it if you do not finish the bottle in one night. I thought that was pretty neat, and Im certainly enjoy it!		This product is so simple to use just open the wine, push the aerator down in the bottle, pour, sniff and assess, and then ENJOY! I love the fact that it comes with a little carrying bag!  Any added extras is always a plus in my book.		All in all, am I pleased with this item? Yes, 100%. I cant say enough great things about this item. Its sleek, its compact, and it actually works. I would suggest that you open your bottle of wine (Im only referring to red because thats all I drink), let it sit after you open it for about 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes have elapsed, grab this aerator and pour into your wine glass. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Im personally elated with my purchase, and Id definitely by this as a gift for others. Enjoy, my friends!		This is an honest review, so if you find my review helpful in anyway, please click the helpful button!! I purchased this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and forthcoming review. I hope this helps!
1,no
1,What a horrible disappointment!!  Look at the beautiful thread work on this pillow.  Well that's not what you'll get if you purchase it.  You'll get a picture of it on a cheap piece of material.  It's so cheap that the picture of the real product is very, very blurred.
1,I would not pay 11 cents for these knives. They lack balance (the blade is extremely light while the handle is heavy), they are not sharp, and they rust really easy. I bought the whole set of these knives for a friend that needed a set of cheap knives because he hardly ever cooks. I was not going to buy him Shun or MAC knives because he hardly ever cooks at home, so I thought these would be acceptable. I was wrong!!! They are very akward to use, especially if you have been use to using better grade knives. His set rusted in a matter of weeks, he didn't put them in the dishwasher and he never just let them sit in the sink. Do not buy these kinves, if it is the cost that is motivating you to buy these, there are other brands out there that are better than these and are in the same price range. I am a knife snob, I have been a professional chef for 10 years and I know a good knife. If I would have been able to try these out first, that would of deterred me from buying them. I have always heard that Ginsu was a good brand for the cost but evidently they have changed their formula because these are not what I remember Ginsu being.
1,There is almost no suction power, it just pushes the dirt around on tile floors, and when you turn it off, some of the dirt just falls out.
1,This is the second review I've written for these, apparently I wasn't nice enough last time. So here is a niced up version. These are not as nice as I thought they were going to be. The remote is difficult to use, they use a lot of batteries and they don't look like candles, they just kind of glow. I will be keeping them however because this company wants to charge me half of my refund for return shipping even though they were Prime.
1,Very pretty but does not have drainage holes or is elevated so get scummy inside and out. I drilled holes in the bottom and attached rubber feet. Made it work a lot better, but now it's rusting away. Still pretty and works OK but won't last.
1,So very disappointed.  Was gifted with pin on by a co-worker upon retiring.  Excited to see it available here, could not wait to receive.  It doesn't burn. I have used books of matches, regular lighters that burn your fingers from being held on for so long as pellet barely burns.....temporarily !!  Little holder useless.
1,I am underwhelmed, considering the price. They are smaller than regular placemats, the stitching is not straight, and the material is very thin. The pattern is growing on me, though. The gold embellishment is nice. It has shine to it.		Update: went to grab a fifth placement and remembered the pack only came with four...this continues to disappoint.
1,These shouldn't even be called a cone - they are so slim it's difficult for it to stand.  Plus it takes forever to light.  I hold the lighter to it for minutes, and it still doesn't catch.  I've only been able to light 1 and have it stay lit, so I can't even comment on the scent.  I don't know if it's this brand or what the problem is, but I would not purchase these ever again.
1,The plastic rim near the smaller blade broke the first time I used it.
1,I bought this expecting some solid workmanship (or at least resembling it). Instead I got a piece of something that my eldest daughter could have done (and did!). Save your money....buy a Tardis Fridge instead. At least you can drink whiskey from that. Yeah this review went way off course.
1,I bought this because I wanted a slightly softer pillow memory foam. I am not sure why people like it, but I found extremely Soft, not supportive at all and not foamy.	Returned
1,Total waste of money. Doesn't crank well. I was using it for salt and it seriously could not handle it. Kept getting stuck and then handle would become misaligned. Not made well at all. Look for another.
1,It's very flimsy and skinny and don't shake it, it flies all over the place.
1,The green glass is not as pictured.  It's more muted.  And with a candle lit inside, it gives off a pale yellow tone at best.  Where was the Amazon quality control on this one?
1,I am returning the blanket.  It has a rough feel to the material.  Not something I want to cozy up with for a nap.
1,Not PFOA Free.
1,Not sure why it's called a tray. You can barely put anything on this. It's cute but so far I haven't found much use for it. I will think of something though. Don't expect to use this as a serving tray unless you're serving maybe two tiny drinks. But I should have paid closer attention to the measurements before purchasing.
1,Way too small and only use watch batteries. Returned them.
1,Poor craftmenship, made my arms break out with a rash.  Don't waste your time or money.
1,Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said pro and con.		I will say first of all, don't buy this coffee maker, it's way to expensive for the pros that you'll get.		Does it make a drinkable cup of coffee, yes it does, but not to be compared to a press pot.		The coffee does not stay hot near as long as they claim, maybe 20 minutes.		The coffee does not taste the same after 20 minutes like they claim.		I would not pay $75 to $100 dollars for this maker, maybe $30.		Buy a Mr Coffee maker, it's just as good.		Want the best cup of coffee, get a press pot, the only draw back is that you can't keep it fresh very long, and you can't make a lot of it at once.		If it's just you and your significant other, get a 12 cup Bodum Press Pot, boil your water and get quality coffee beans and enjoy.		Save your money on this maker, it's way over rated.
1,I have used many Ball products, but this one is very sloppily produced. The labels are very thin, like tissue paper thin. They don't have a glossy sheen to them, so the ink bleeds out onto the paper easily. The labels are hard to peel away from their backing, since they are so thin. The labels are easy to rip when trying to lift them up from their backing. This product comes in one long roll. The roll was glued at the end, so not only it ruined the end label, but the glue covered 2 other labels and ruined them, so down to 57 labels in this box. I wouldn't buy this product again, unless it was priced at about 50 cents. Next time I'll go to a scrapbook store to buy labels. I'm surprised that Ball allowed this product to be poorly done.
1,Loved it while it worked. Used about 10 times in the past 6 months and stopped working tonight :(
1,blade is dull and the shell holder is hard and hard to handle..not worth it
1,As usual, I shopped all around before making this purchase. After realizing how heavy and/or loud other vacumms were that are much more expensive, I figured I'd save some money and settle on this one. Well, it's been under 3 years and the switch that stops the beater brush from spinning for use on bare floors is broken.  It was a difficult switch to operate to begin with, and if you have arthritis, forget it! It's too costly to fix, so the dreaded search for another vacuum is once again underway. UGH!!
1,Well, I love these hand towels.  Thick and soft and appear durable.  Nice design.  Thats why I am giving them 5 stars.  However, don't make the same mistake I did.  the towels pictured under the name "Bisque" are not light beige as you would expect Bisque to be. They are a salmon color like the color that appears on my monitor under the name Bisque.  I am ordering more in another color, based on the picture, not the name.  (I would expect the beechnut towels to be a tann-ish or light yellow color,  for example, but the picture is light green.  Luckily, I'm not interested in that color.)		Update:  I have not used the bisque towels much due to color. However, I ordered the bath towels and they are falling apart at the seams and faded after 5 or more washings.  I regret the purchase and cannot understand the positive reviews.
1,Well the blades do turn round and round, but as for moving significant air, I can't say it does that.  I had it spinning very fast sitting on the back/side of a very hot stove, where they tell you to put it, and I could hold a ribbon in front of the blades and it sort of flutters, right at the blade.  So yes, the fan does turn the blades when the stove is hot, but as for actually moving enough air to make a difference in heat distribution, nope.  It looks cool sitting there and spinning, so I'll keep it, but it's an attractive 3 pound spinning paperweight.
1,Waste of money. in
1,Horrible quality. Does not fit 18" pillow. The measurement flat is barely 17" square. Should fit maybe a 16" pillow. Sold as a set of two...but the design on the covers are completely different sizes. For example, the rectangles that contain the letters S H E R measure over 4.5" tall on one cover, but isn't even 3" on the other cover. Complete waste of money.
1,The oven temperature fluctuates 50 degrees or more on bake.	The tines included will not hold a chicken so you will need to purchase the 4 prong ones.	This unit is quite big and consequently the broil function will not properly heat the oven.	The seller, J&R Music, is difficult to deal with for returning a defective unit.		I would not buy this unit ... trying to return it.
1,These are not very wide.  They are not very absorbent either.  The description says cotton, but they feel like polyester.  It takes several washes to get the fuzz under control, and by then the edges already started fraying.  I would not buy these again.
1,A little thinner than i thought. And plastic. Very cheap plastic. But the print is solid.
1,They do not tell you if this is 3 1/4 inside  or outside diameter.  They are 3 1/4 outside diameter which is smaller than required for typical 1/2 pint to 3 pint jars.
1,It's very small and I am a small woman
1,I tried lighting one of the sticks and it would not light.  The second stick did light but the scent/smell is horrible!  Would not recommend.
1,I very much wanted this thingie to work because I want to use my local coffee house fresh coffee but not be bothered with having to make a full pot. (My wife enjoys the Keurig Pod but I can't find a decent pod coffee, so I tried this. 1) Very slow to brew, especially on the "bold" setting, like seven minutes? And to make a quick second cup??? faghedabout it, 2) Even after that long the thing keeps dripping long after you removed the cup, 3) Sometime you get all the water you put in, other times just half a cup or so, 4) Looks like EZ to clean but pretty much the same as my old four-cup standard pot. Grounds accumulate in hidden spots, 5) No matter how much I varied coffee and water levels what came out tasted same as the much EZier Pod coffee, which is to say, not very good. 6) When brewing the thing just hisses and spits coffee widely so more clean up!. Simply not worth the effort; a good idea not fully realized. Save your $$. I returned this item.
1,To wear this ring you almost have to be a sumo wrestler
1,Most of them didn't work upon arrival. Don't waste your time or money here.
1,This is the first item I have bought from Amazon that I am totally displeased with.  I followed all the enclosed instructions regarding preparation and care of said merchandise in the hopes that they would provide me years of cooking pleasure.  Instead, everything sticks to the pans and frying pan, there are white dots all over the bottoms of the pans and, in general, I am NOT a happy camper.
1,After a number of months, the printing of the temperatures faded to nothing, and the glass frosted so even the dial is difficult to read.
1,This was so frustrating to me that I spent a couple hours on it and put it away, forever. There are SO many numbers with an arrow to the spot to paint, that you have to keep stopping or skipping what you're working on. Then, once you've filled in that tiny spot, the paint number is still is still next to that spot so now it's hard to tell what THAT spot is supposed to be painted! Also, it doesn't help that the numbers are hand written. I'm just unhappy with the whole thing.
1,The screen rusted after the first use.  Unfortunately, I didn't try it until after the return date, so all I can do now is trash it.
1,Will only count up to 3 seconds and then counts down after resetting.  Will not count up any further.  Also the readout is fuzzy, not clear!
1,I bought this about 2 years ago, and still regret it. It works well for about 30 seconds, then it just stops producing steam. The reservoir is full, the switch is on and lit up, and the handle is up high, but it just stops steaming. It's very frustrating when two people need a shirt steamed before a night out, and you have to speed through them to make sure you have enough time to get both done before the steam stops flowing. Other people have complained about this so I know the one I have is not just broken.
1,They are super flimsy, they work but i wouldn't buy them again. You get what you pay for. I went cheap and that's what i got.
1,I purchased this stockpot to prepare nectar (sugar in water) for hummingbirds, which I like to boil to help it keep longer. I noticed rust spots on the inside bottom of the pot after I used it the first time, but they came off easily enough with a green pad. Since that was late fall and the birds had migrated, it was several months until I used the pot again. This time the rust spots were more numerous and larger, but I was still able to clean them off. I used the pot for the third time last week, and now the rust spots have developed into pits in the bottom of the pot, and no matter how much scrubbing I do I can't get them off. Now it's been too long since the purchase and I can no longer return it. I'll keep using it, but only for the birds.
1,Broke after 6 months.  Expected more from the Eureka brand, and the reviews.
1,Adhesive sticker placed on stainless steel was very difficult to remove.  It's gummy residue despite trying to remove is still on spatula.  Tip of spatula despite using gentle dish soap,  is now blackened and discolored.  Did not use any abrasive sponges.  Can't believe it.  It is only a couple days old. Waste of money.  Will never buy products from this company again.
1,Very heavy and even worse with food in it Cleaned up well
1,Picture is wrong.  What we received were two Kelsyus Floating Hammocks, and not Floating Loungers.  There is no center cross piece or backrest pillow.
1,Cheap plastic parts - I've used the potato masher only once - went to use it today and discovered that the little plastic hub that holds the blade in is cracked, rendering the part useless. And unfortunately I mainly bought it for the mashing attachment.
1,Frying pans are bent and chipped.  Picture shows a label.  There was no label because this is not the pan that you get.  The two that I received did not have black handles.  The handles are chrome.  Contacted seller, they want me to pay to return the two pans.  Because of the weight, The cost will probably equal, or exceed the price. This is what they are hoping.  So, NOW I read the reviews.	Many of them say, DO NOT BUY.  I am going to return them.  I will not jeopardize my family's health by using it.  I can still smell the last owner food-Gross.  My Question-Why does Amazon keep selling this item?  Please do not buy it.
1,Didn't realize the pill size would be "horse" size.  They are too big for throat and my elder mother's. We have to crush each one. Not so good.
1,Really cute, and really broken.  Immediately (like 3 days) stopped keeping time despite two battery changes.
1,We haven't even owned this for six months and I'm already ordering a new can opener because this one isn't working. It skips, fails to pierce cans and sometimes just doesn't even rotate the blades even though your cranking the handle. Very disappointed in the quality.
1,THE SET IS NICE, VERY HEAVY, OF COURSE MINE CAME WITH A CHIPPED BOWL, AMAZON IS GIVING ME 5 DOLLARS CREDIT, BIG DEAL, IM SO UPSET, THEY MUST CHIP VERY EASY
1,I'm so disappointed in this hand blender. It worked just OK in the beginning, but there seems to be something wrong with the battery now, as it will not fully charge (the fact that the red charging light stays on no matter how long you have it plugged in). I am going to contact customer service and will update this review. I purchased this a little over a year ago. Would not recommend this item.
1,the liner seemed strong while handling it.  that was the good part.  bad part is I see burn marks on the surface from the heating elements.  I've used the liner 3 times. 1 area is getting white.	max temp I've used in toaster oven is 400 degrees for 1 time about 20 minutes.  rest of the time I was using 325-350 degrees.  this liner is supposed to be able to handle higher temps.  I will be looking for a replacement
1,Forget about it! Get the original British Berkefeld ceramic filters. Don't mess with these. They are terrible.
1,DON'T FIT
1,These are so flimsy that the handle & top border of the hamper ripped off before even putting anything in it. Very Poor Quality for $4.95 ea. It was a bad mistake ordering 3 of them. I have found another hamper of similar quality at the Dollar Tree (which I bought just for comparison sake). I will stick with buying hampers I can see & touch beforehand from now on.
1,Fuzz comes off these sheets constantly. Even after washing, the dryer was still full of fuzz each and every time that they were washed.
1,Does not fit my older Genesis Gold C which has a wider plastic handle. Someone needs to add a compatibility list. Instructions show three kinds of handles that it fits, none of which are mine.
1,Seriously wrong! The picture shows blue on the wings, top of head and 'blue water' around the grassy reeds. The blue is bright and very colorful. However, in reality, the blue is a dull, dark color and no blue on the 'water' at all. The white on the neck is also a dull beige. Very disappointed. I will have to repaint to make it match my decor now. Price was cheap enough, which is the only up side to this piece. See picture shown on Amazon and then see the picture showing what it really looks like.
1,I bought this and really liked it at first.  So much I decided to buy a new bread knife because mine was not overly sharp as it came from a cheap set. I bought a Victorinox 47547 10-1/4-Inch Wavy Bread Knife, Black Fibrox Handle and began finding white pieces of plastic shavings on the bread.  After a bit of looking I found the knife used to slice thin pieces from the guide making the product unusable.  So unless you are using a fairly dull bread knife I would look for a stainless steel bread guide. On that not I have yet to find one. Perhaps the makers of this product might look at that.
1,This vacuum is impossible to push on longer pile/tall carpets.  It just doesn't work at all if the carpet or rug is tall.  Also, the canister is SUPER loud...need hearing protection to use it.  Not worth the money.
1,I bought this product from Amazon and after working well for 2 days I decided to wash and defrost the whole refer/ freezer.  I left the sensor in place after turning off the refer/freezer. Well, the freezer sensor got wet and stopped working. I called the manufacturer to order and pay for a new sensor. Well to my surprise, they do not sell a replacement sensor nor do they repair them. The best the company would do is give 20% off the list price to buy another whole unit.	 Do NOT buy this unit. They have the worst customer service and make no effort to help a customer. I freely admit it was my fault that the sensor got wet. I just wanted to purchase another sensor. Thanks to Amazon return policy, I am going to return it, but I will not buy another AcuRite product.
1,They're neat, and I know they're for quiches and tarts, but they failed my purposes. I bought them to make small frittatas in that I could take to work and eat. They worked great and didn't leak the first couple times, then leaked horrible every time after that. I don't get why they worked at first, and then didn't. After completely wasting ingredients one Sunday night, I got pissed and chucked the whole set. I'm never going to make a quiche, tart, or any other crusted bottom thing, so these are useless to me.
1,Didn't realize this would be coming from China (literally), it took weeks to get here. Very flimsy and poor quality.
1,I wear a size 13 shoe and NONE of my shoes fit in it! Good product for small shoes but if you have a man's sized foot don't bother.
1,This rug is ugly in person, it is fairly thick but also very rough. I think it looks cheap.
1,Wholesale-Interiors do not  stand behind their products. This furniture like most sold online needs to be assembled, it is in parts. Most furniture manufacturer's will include their contact information in case an item is missing out of the package. Wholesale-Interiors do not. When you do manage to find contact information on them, they do not answer their phone or return calls. Finally I emailed them and they told me that I needed to purchase the replacement parts. I guess if you really like the price and the design you will risk dealing with the very poor customer service.
1,Terrible burn smell. Tried it twice before I threw it out, mostly still full.
1,Served us fine for a bit over a year, and then started sparking and popping and and shorting out, even when empty (before you reply saying there's metal in it). Discarded and now looking for a replacement. I guess for $60 one doesn't expect TOO much, but I do expect more than 18 months of use!
1,They either came out burned or severely undercooked. I'm a good cook... so i don't think it's from lack of ability. I ended up tossing it the day after getting it. What a waste.
1,No where in this listing did it say the size other than Large, going by the picture it's a bit deceiving. I received these and for me they are way too small, after further research on the Tupperware site they only hold 1 cup, I was looking for at least 2-3 cup capacity. I prob should've done more research before purchasing, but assumed these weren't going to be so small. Also the ones labeled as "small" are only a 1/2 cup capacity...just fyi for anyone looking. Overall they are OK, and typical Tupperware product.
1,Didn't really fit my shark steam cleaner, but I made due and still used them, because they were to large,T they are very thin really not much substance to.
1,Would not buy again. Very thin and slippery, will not stay on bed.
1,big can cook well
1,I purchased these from Costco.  I find them too grippy and hard to work with.  I have also broken about 5 of them where the metal hook breaks out of the plastic frame - no recovery.		While they are indeed thin, I don't think I will purchase these again.
1,Returned because it was too big for the space
1,Picture does not reflect the product.  The sheets are BROWN.  Not the color in the photo at all.  Description states 15 inch pockets, when received the package clearly states 12 inch pocket on fitted sheet.  RETURNED without requesting a replacement.  Seller not cooperative.  Buy elsewhere.
1,One arrived not working at all.  The smaller two lost their flame (it dimmed) within a few days on the timer.  Not a good investment.  Why bother including batteries that don't work.  better advertise batteries not included.  Customer then has time to purchase fresh ones.
1,I bought this pan in January and have used it maybe 20 times. This morning, the bottoms of my popovers had bits of nonstick coating in them. I don't own a dishwasher, so the pan suffered no abuse that way. Once, the popovers stuck in it (so much for nonstick), and that required soaking and then some scrubbing with a gentle scouring pad, the kind that's supposed to be okay for nonstick. I'm not tough on pans, because I want them to last. This is why I avoid nonstick ones, because eventually most of them fail, and there's nothing you can do once the coating starts peeling. In this case, I had no choice, because all the popover pans I've found are nonstick. This one worked well until this morning, but now I guess I'll go back to my non-nonstick muffin tin for the time being.
1,I was successful with 2 out of 7 lanterns. The others either burst into flames on the ground or the paraffin fell off the lantern. Trying to successfully launch the lanterns can be a flaming catastrophe.
1,I you do not have small kids or pets or someone that can make it fell, it is a nice option.	Cheap materials but that is fair with the price I paid.
1,Labeling makes you think you're purchasing cotton!!  They are microfiber!!!  Yes they are very soft but they are NOT cotton!!  I thought I was purchasing cotton.
1,Did not hold up to the heat and melted in the pot
1,not good for my makeup, really only good for lipstick. To small! cost more to return that I spent buying it!
1,This tablecloth did not look nice like the picture.  I have not been able to remove the folds.  I tried a blow dryer but that didn't work. One reviewer stated that it is finished on the ends.  Mine was not.  My husband thought I had bought a drop cloth for painting because of how thin it is and the small package it came it. I had to pull it apart to open it fully just like a drop cloth.  It will do what I need but next time I will go to the fabric store and buy it off the roll.
1,too small
1,Didnt fit my mixer, returned
1,Not comfortable
1,Not as concentrated as described. Candles smell nice when sniffed directly,  but the fragrance does not permeate while burning. Pretty disappointed.
1,Let it not be said that all Vine reviews are positive! I "bought" this hoping it would be useful for cleaning up in the kitchen and car, and was very disappointed. This is good to clean up small spills and "easy" messes like spilled cereal, but its woefully underpowered and thus can't pull much of anything out of crevaces and carpet. It's thus virtually useless for cleaning a car!		Lastly, the ergonomics on this unit couldn't be worse. You can pretty much just tell from the picture: It's very front heavy, with no weight in the handle (or behind it). As such, it's rather unpleasant to use.		This is a second Dirt Devil I've had, and at this point I'm absolutely done with the brand. They have evidently become cheap, throw-away vacuums not meant to last.
1,This literally fell to pieces after only 5 months of use. What a huge waste of money. I wish I could give it zero stars.
1,I purchase the shelves because of the fact they stated they had very sturdy blue that would hold these shelves in place on the smooth surface. I was very disappointed in these shells because no matter where I tried they would not stick to the surface that I was trying to apply them to. The suction cups are very low quality and will not adhere to any smooth surface that I have tried them on. I now have three shelf surface and one long shelf that I can do nothing with. I do not recommend these shelf whatsoever.
1,You have to have the eyes of an eagle to even read this.
1,These just look cheap to me.
1,when you don't pay much for a rug i guess your expectations should not be set too high, but come on...i ripped the tag off the back without looking close enough and when it came off it took all the fibers on the rug that were stuck to it!! leaving a square patch of bald rug showing on the front.
1,Wish I'd washed it immediately - then returned it.  I don't know how a down alternative comforter can shed like this, but there's constantly a PILE of fibers on the carpet near the foot of my bed (my duvet cover has buttons - so it's not "sealed" completely along the end.  And, OMG, when I take it out to wash the cover - what a mess!!!  At this rate, it should be completely devoid of filling in about 6 months.  And, as others have mentioned, it's slippery as all get out.  Don't even THINK about it if your duvet cover doesn't have ties in the corners to help secure the duvet.  Mine doesn't, and I often wake up with half the comforter bunched up in the lower half of the cover.  Ugh!!!
1,Doesn't work that good
1,Piece of junk. Followed all directions perfectly still did not work. After trying multiple times the timer started to tick but it would not ring. You can get a better quality kitchen timer at the dollar store.
1,We purchased it only 8 months ago and it is in TATTERS.  We have it covering a fire pit.  Not only are there more holes and tears than I can possible patch with duct tape, but the elastic strap is also stretched out.  This is a piece of junk.
1,You would think with a kitchen aid product that it would be top notch....but the kids do to close well. So u have to be careful if you have any liquids inside...will spill...wish I had retuned this one...
1,Save your money. This blender has no power and cannot make a smoothie. It is not good for anything more than chopping parsley.
1,It rusts in 1 month. See the picture for yourself. It is ridiculous! Don't buy it!
1,The candle I received had a pinkish color on the top 1/3 of the candle.  I returned it.
1,too thick!
1,waste product, difficult to fix not strong enough
1,I sent it back ..damaged! I paid 11.00+ but there's a price tag of 5.99 on it.
1,This is VERY small.  If you want a regular sized drainer this one is not for you.  Pretty but oh so small.
1,This is really flimsy and I'm not sure it's worth the price at all.  I wouldn't buy another one.
1,Top is loose. It's looks cute.
1,Worked okay until after about a year the top coils just stopped working. I keep hearing the warnings about B&D appliances being junk and I should have heeded them. It had some "features" I wasn't happy with, such as the timer that was inaccurate, the undocumented burn feature, the difficulty cleaning it, the door not closing all the way - letting heat escape, and the rack that often jammed when trying to slide it out. Other than that, I guess it actually did cook some things okay.
1,Returned this table immediately upon first assembly.  CHEAP and FLIMSY.  This table is total junk.
1,Small and poor quality, can get locally much cheaper
1,I ordered this in May 2015.  This item disintegrated completely.  I have had many clothespin bag through the years, this is a first.  It was only out while clothes were on the line then brought into the house.  Not a good product at all!!!!!!
1,I have lots of rubbermaid storage containers and have found the standard ones satisfactory; have two sets of these however and the fastening tabs have all failed after less than 3 years of use.  Rubbermaid neither sells nor replaces these lids so the 2 sets will be recycled.  I have tupperware that has been in constant use for 25 years...
1,Awesome chair, keeps you cool, wider than normal.  Purchased via Sam's Club but this is the second chair that has broken on me.  Doesn't get used often, always indoors so no heat soak issues.  Attempting to go through the manufacture for a replacement.
1,Lighter than expected, doesn't rotate that smoothly. Has to be balanced on both sides with similar weight or it doesn't turn well at all. Not worth the price.
1,The vein pattern is super light. It does not look like the picture. We are fairly disappointing.
1,An excellent tool! My first one had button problems so I did the Amazon Return thing and had a replacement in no time at all. The second one works fine! I knock off a star for that.		12/31/2014		I'm having to drop my rating to 2-Stars. I had to return the first unit in June because the temp-hold button didn't work. This new unit has now developed the same problem 6 months down the road. I have to believe it's a pattern. It has not been abused or, submersed in any way, even though it is supposed to be waterproof!
1,The design is pretty from the outside, but don't be fooled by the Japanese name,  construction is poor.	The base contact to the unit is really not well designed, and you'll get problems soon enough, the switch is also pretty faulty, mine lasted about 18 months.
1,I was hoping they were going to be a better quality. They are not stainless steel.  Real flimsy.
1,Everything sticks to the sides.
1,I just got these in and am very disappointed in the color.  It is a very grayish blue, not the brighter blue.  They aren't even a denim blue.  The only reason that I'm keeping them is because they do match another set of dishcloths that I just received and are also not the color that I was hoping for. Buyer beware if you're looking for a brighter blue.
1,The threading on the cap is very poorly cut and it's not like you can close it in 2 seconds.	Overall it kept my alcohol in my flask without leaking, but the cap just sucks.
1,Opening and closing the pop up feature is not as easy as advertised and think size is bigger than needed for most plates. Not easy to store as too big to stand on its side in a drawer.
1,mine broke. i'm 180 pound and after 1 month , the plywood under the seating cushion broke. now we cannot sit on it. it is just used as storage.
1,Mine was defective.  Paint chipped off (a lot of it) and bottom has a huge dent.  I am returning.  What an inconvenience.
1,While these are pretty and good size for the boots, they are incredibly flimsy. They do not hold shape at all so once you have them filled, it's a jumbled mess. Try to push them under the bed is impossible if you have carpet. I will be buying new ones immediately.
1,broke after a few months .
1,Broke after 2 uses.  Not sure why, the ice cream was not frozen that hard, a spoon was able to retrieve it out of the carton, not this item.
1,No.  very uncomfortable. Seat it very deep and prevents your feet from touching the floor and I'm 5'6.
1,Amazon's customer service was outstanding with this transaction, from start to end.		After letting it air out for a week and using a full can of febreeze on it, we discovered that had to be returned because it was cut incorrectly - it was a parallelogram, not a true rectangle.		After letting the second one air out, we again measured the size and discovered that the second one was just cut just barely ok. Not perfect, but it would work. Then we used yet another full can of febreeze to get rid of the chemical smell.		Finally, we were able to sleep on it. It's ok. Nothing amazing. Nothing terrible. We'll see how long it lasts.		The list price for item is laughable. It this item is normally  $1,019.99, then you should expect nothing but perfection.		Update:		After 7 month of use, has developed huge, deep cracks in it. It tears and cracks under the stress of its own weight.
1,This item is really for very lightweight clothing storage - say leggings, not pants.  So, I can modify my plans and use it for leggings, but I really needed to hang pants and it's not strong enough for that, and it's difficult to maneuver heavier clothing off and onto this hanger.
1,Lasted for 2 hours of use (total not continuous).  I will stick to my cheaper mixers that last longer.
1,The Juiceman appears to be a great value at first. This appliance looks and feels sturdy and comes with two types of juicer. One is the classic "spinning cone" that you press a half a citrus against. It's essentially a motorized version of the glass juicer that we have just about all used at one time or another. The other juicer function is the "juice extractor" which is the configuration pictured in the Amazon website photo. This is the way we spent our testing time, in this configuration, and we were frankly kind of disappointed. The Juiceman produced juice, but it produced a LOT more pulp. I found I could get about as much juice by hand squeezing the pulp at the end of an extraction than the extraction itself. Seemed odd. We followed all the instructions, and our observation is that the recipe yields in the instruction book are optimistic at best. In general, it seemed to take us about twice as many apples to make a cup of juice as suggested in the book. It seemed to take about three times as many carrots. In talking with friends who had more experience with this kind of unit, we found that they had a couple of recommendations: 1. Make sure you have only the freshest, juiciest fruits and vegetables and that you soak carrots and celery in water before use; 2. The several times more expensive juicers exist because they work better. Upon checking some web sources, we found that most of the folks who are really happy with their juicers, whatever the brand, seem to gravitate towards the $300-500 kind. Wow! This Juiceman is $79. So, a way to look at it is, how much extra fruit and vegetable can you buy for the added couple hundred dollars? Probably enough that you'll get tired of juicing before you make up the difference. A poor way to look at it, I'm sure, but here is why I say this.		The Juiceman is not fun to clean. Juicing carrots seemed to leave a glaze on the surface of the extractor cup, which is a spinning steel and plastic bowl inside the machine. It has sharp spurs on the bottom of the cup to grind off bits of fruit and vegetable which are then centrifuged against the fine screened sides which allow the juice to fly out into the collection area of the unit when in operation. We went through half a Costco bag of carrots, four apples, a bunch of spinach, four large celery stalks, etc. This required emptying the pulp bin about four times. We got well under a pint of juice altogether. In fact, the four of us were using shot glasses to share the output. When we finished and I went to do final cleaning, it was very hard to remove the filmy glaze on the bottom of the extractor cup. I soaked it overnight in water. The next day, it was still had to scrub off. I used a toothbrush for the task. They supply a cleaning brush in the kit, which is essentially a stiff toothbrush, too. The other parts didn't have the filmy glaze, but there are a lot of parts to clean. The next hardest cleaning task is the plastic labyrinth that leads the juice out of the spout on the front of the unit. You absolutely need a brush or other implement to reach into these spaces to clean unless you have skinny fingers. Whatever you do, don't let this plastic thing sit after use - you need to clean it immediately. The rest of the pieces are more or less like cleaning a food processor.		I suppose the bottom line here is that I now appreciate why commercial fruit and vegetable juices are not cheap, especially the "organic" health food types. If you must have this kind of appliance, do a lot of checking beforehand and buy enough juicer that you'll be happy with it. This one is not enough unless you have other uses for all the pulp and have enough time to be inefficient about producing juice.
1,This product was not useful for my bridal shower.  Once I am able to use, I will revisit with an updated review on quality.
1,Don't be fooled by the pretty colors. The measuring cups are confusing, in order to nest it's not clear where "level" is for what you are measuring. The sieve is not heat proof, after dumping hot water through it, it clenched tight and then the bowls above it wouldn't sit flush anymore. The large bowls work well, but they are bowls. Hard to mess that up.
1,4 out of 4 bags aren't holding a seal at all.
1,well, I loved this product for the first 10 months.  now it doesn't work other than manually :(  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SKIP this product.  didn't last a YEAR!
1,I have had 3 Keurig coffee pots (different models each time) over the last 5 years. None of them lasted more than 2 years. When they work I love them. They make the best coffee. I like that there is little coffee wasted making one cup at a time. However I am so disappointed about the short amount of time the pot itself lasts. For the amount of money I have spent on each of the units I expect them to last more than 1 to 2 years. On this last pot, because I had trouble with the first 2, I have been consist with cleaning and descaling hoping that would increase the longevity of the unit. But I AGIAN have a pot that doesn't work properly. So disappointed and now coffee-less in the mornings.
1,It broke the second time we used it
1,The gloves do a decent job for the first couple uses. However, after about the 4th use my fingers started to get burnt when i was pulling out items from the oven. The weigh pressure of a dutch oven + the heat made these gloves useless. Will be returning.
1,Horrible grinding power, returned.
1,This is a cheap piece of metal - 2 pieces really. It is small and holds very little water - not enough to last the time it takes to cook a whole piece of meat. It is too smokey for my indoor cooking. I was going to return it, but at $8, you will spend more for the postage. I put it outside on the grill - maybe it will help with veggies. I wish I had read the reviews and not bought this.
1,too small and uncomfortable for using while I do my art work.
1,This product is the worst. The 'cube' needs to be assembled. Too bad that there's no glue provided and the pieces come apart instantly.		garbage and waist of money
1,My batter leaked out
1,The picture looks great - color background makes it easier to read the numbers, and to differentiate between indoor/outdoor. Makes you wonder why would anybody purchase the monochrome one? Well, I have the answer. As soon as you open the battery compartment you see a cardboard insert warning you that batteries are just for backup - you should always use the AC adapter. They must be kidding, right? It has holes to hang on the wall, just like the monochrome one - how do you hang it with an AC adapter? I tried it with just batteries. The display is dim and the color background makes it hard to read. I plugged in the adapter, and the screen becomes backlit, super-bright. I would say the glow is too strong, makes me wonder if the picture on Amazon is of the real thing, or just the printed overlay that protects the screen in the box. I can't imagine keeping that glowing device in a bedroom, or any other place where you may enjoy dim lights.	In conclusion, if you plan to keep it on a table, in a room where the glow is not a concern, you could give it a try. Even then, the glow may not be pleasant. Otherwise, go with the monochrome one.	This product looks like a great idea that turned out not to be functional, but somebody still decided to push it to market. Bad deal.
1,BACON DID NOT EVENLY COOK AND I DO HAVE A VERY GOOD MICROWAVE......I GET BETTER RESULTS WITH JUST PUTTING BACON ON PAPER TOWELS, THEN TURNING THEM OVER AFTER A FEW MINUTES.  I THINK THE BACON COOKS FASTER ON THE PAPER TOWELS TOO.
1,Terrible packaging kills my review for this product. The product was so poorly packaged that the plastic water tank arrived busted. For this reason, I have been unable to use the product. I immediately contacted the company, and they were quite friendly and *seemed* willing to help me by sending me a new tank (hence my 2 stars instead of 1). However, that was at least a month ago and, as of yet, they have not kept that promise. From what I can gather by reading the product manual, this product does not have a steamer, and it brews by capsules that are similar to k-cups but not identical. Since the water tank is necessary for operation, until it comes, I am unable to actually rate the product on its operation and performance.
1,Ordered two- each of them cracked above the wheel within 3 weeks of ordering. Cheaply made, poorly designed.
1,I had this unit for just over 6 months using it maybe 24 times. As with others the milk wand came off many times and the silly plastic clips broke one by one. I call Customer service who told me they would send me a re-designed milk wand, this took 10 weeks as they are on back order. Used it about a dozen times and the new part also split. By this time the machine was over a year old so i paid $17.00 for a new milk wand. I was sent the old version which i sent straight back requesting a re designed version, well that was 9 weeks ago and still nothing. Im going to trash this machine and look for a better make on Amazon. My advice stay well clear of the name KRUPS....
1,I got two of these mugs for Christmas and was so disappointed to find they DO NOT work as advertised. First, the lock setting leaks profusely. I'm a wheelchair user and have to carry things on my lap. Thus, I need a  mug to seal. These do not! Second, the hole for drinking is on the edge of a smooth curve and is therefore very awkward to drink from. I found it impossible to drink without leaving a drip on the edge that then runs down the side if you don't lick it off. As the title says, this was a clever idea for a mug quite poorly executed.
1,Ripped almost immediately, disappointing considering it is supposed to be thicker and I assumed, sturdier material
1,No. This candle smells like one of those cheap things you hand from your rearview mirror that smells like "new car leather smell" totally missed the mark for my nose. It was not worth the money when I could just go buy one of the cheap new car things. I was disappointed because these had such good reviews. I must have a weird nose but as a female who typically has a very good sense of smell it just smells like fake and cheap leather. Not impressed and the man in the house didn't even want me to burn it and he's not usually picky.
1,Looks nice, but does not cut very well.  Maybe works better for harder cheeses, but for soft cheeses, forget it.  Spend a bit more and get something that won't frustrate you.  I also bought the Boska one for ~$14.00 and it works quite well.
1,The blanket is warm but after a few weeks, it had little balls all over it and it started to loose its smooth texture.  Better off buying a more heavy weight fleece blanket since this one is lightweight and not durable.
1,Purchased Feb 18th 2015, as of 9/01/2015 it is done.  Just had to buy another coffee pot, this one didn't last too long.  My mom insists on only buying kitchen aid products because she is trying to collect all of them (like pokemon). We started having problems with this a few months ago.  When it was brewing coffee the little silver door in the picture, where you put coffee grounds would pop open.  It started off doing it only once but then started doing it multiple times.  The last straw was that where the ground are accumulated hot water (and not to brew coffee normally, this water was still there after 30 minutes, she knows better than to open the little door while its brewing, so my mom not knowing this opened it and the hot water splashed and burned her.  Nothing too serious fortunately, but it was painful for her. I do not recommend this product.  The new coffee maker we have is Kitchen Aid again, this time a different model we bought from Sam's Club.  Hopefully that one works better.
1,It did a good job of grinding, but it was so loud that I could hardly stand it.  At that high price, I was shocked that it was louder than the grinder that I paid $30 for 15 years ago.  It was even louder than the one that I bought about 3 years ago and paid $40 for that one.  I was really disappointed because I wanted a new quiet grinder that did a good job grinding the beans.  It satisfied one need, but not the other.  I sent it back.
1,I am the only one who drinks coffee in the house so I thought this was perfect and only used it once a morning. This morning the lights were very dim and it just wouldn't pull enough electricity to make the water hot thus, not working at all. I thought it was the plug but after trying 3 plugs, I concluded it was the coffeepot. I am disappointed, I thought Mr. Coffee was a reputable brand.
1,Arrived broken! Looks Used and has rust and paint missing.
1,Did not self adjust on Berber carpet.  Sent it back.  Lady was super at resolving issues.
1,I purchased this about six months ago and the padding is already showing bad signs of wear. I sit in this chair about a half hour every other day. I would highly recommend not buying this chair as it does not hold up well.
1,As I was making a smoothie a couple of days ago, a piece of the blade broke off the NutriBullet without my knowledge. I poured my smoothie into a glass and proceeded to drink it. A piece of the blade was in my mouth and thinking it was a piece of strawberry I chewed it. If I swallowed it I would have choked. I'm waiting to hear from customer service. I want to know why a blade would break off during making a smoothie. I have only had it for 5 months. What action do they plan to take and how are they going to prevent this from happening to someone else. What if this happened to an elderly person or a young child? I was promised a newer version. However, they had FedEx come to pick up the damaged harmful NutriBullet and have not given me a full refund or the newer NutriBullet. Has this happened to anyone else?
1,I thought this would be better than what it was! it cuts into your hands as you try to use it! I didn't try to put gloves on but I think that would be a plus! you will see what I mean!!!!!!!
1,Did not work. Returned it. Had one for 3 years and loved it. They have really gone down hill in making them.
1,This product came with a cord that doesn't fit the init. Can not be used!
1,It was too firm.
1,Not mountable, wobbly, had to take it down and dump.
1,Candle was lit for little over an hr and the candle jar broke from the heat. there was glass all over the counter which is why i said it is dangerous
1,Not sturdy and easy to bend. I returned it.
1,This cuisinart sounds like a shrieking ghoul when processing and it terrifies my cat. I pretty much need to use ear plugs when using this food processor. Otherwise, it works and is lightweight.
1,They did not relight at all.
1,It is small and because it is not illuminated, you must have it right in front of your face to read the time.
1,not up to snuff
1,I have had this pan for 4+ years I always grab it to use it on the stove and I am ALWAYS disappointed just about everything I try to cook in it sticks to it no matter what I try butter, Pam, vegetable oil or olive oil the food always sticks to the bottom of the pan.  Its so sad because this pan is perfect otherwise.
1,This is a revised review. No damage and all seals unbroken. But- after finishing the open box of Sandalwood I pulled this out of the cupboard and see that it is not genuine Satya.  You can easily tell by looking at the seal on the ends of the box, but you have to look close.  The manufacturer's address is what fooled me.  In the advertisement you cannot really see the seals but you can see the address and if you really look you will see the email address.  These are not the Bengaluru manufacture.  This is not a bad product but it is not the real thing. So buyer beware.
1,Hard to put together.  Way to expensive for what you get. Top paint coming off.
1,Order this as described, set of 4. Received two. Was offered refund which I appreciated but I would have preferred to receive all chair covers.
1,I love the design and quality seems good but the measurements are off.  The 43-75 size is not actually that size.  Our shower is 44 inches wide.  We could not get the rod down past 45" and finally broke it in the attempt!  There are no returns so unless you want the rod to be bigger I would skip this one!
1,Comrorter ended up being more greenish than grey. Material itself was far to thin and just moving it about made it seem like it was going to rip.
1,some stretching has made the jars fall off. i also cant have spice jars next to each each. they don't fit.
1,This slicer is garbage.  If all you want it for is slicing eggs.. this item is fine..otherwise save your money.  KitchenAid isn't what she used to be.
1,They broke the first day!  ALL of them, No, I didn't get what I paid for because i didn't even get to use them 1x.  My 99cent store plastic scooper does better then these!
1,Tried to cream soft butter and sugar on the lowest speed, using a typical 12" mixing bowl.  A good tablespoon of the mixture ended up on my shirt and on the kitchen wall, counter, and cabinet.  I dug out my old, wimpy Sunbeam and finished the recipe.  The old mixer bogs down in thick mixtures, but at least it doesn't throw bits of sticky goo everywhere. I'm returning the Cuisinart tomorrow.
1,The "glow in the dark" feature doesn't glow for more than about an hour, once the lights in the room are off.  Considering that was the single reason I purchased the clock, I am NOT happy.  I will be returning it, and don't recommend it.
1,plastic dish is as good as any others.....i'd like to see a holder for a butter knife on the side of the cover.
1,I should have noticed that the material wasn't listed in the description, but I was imagining some cotton/poly blend, not 100% plastic.  Not worth even the low price they're charging.
1,Terrible design, just cruel
1,It didn't work for me.
1,Very disappointed. The snap closures break when you reopen the container. Not good when you are serving food!
1,This is quite bad quality and the stitches were already fall apart and the zip is stiff. The size is a bit funny, it is larger than 18*18 as it is suggested, hence you need to buy 20*20 fillings....
1,colors are no where near as vibrant as picture.  also the rug is not as shown in picture w not all of the designs.  wide open expanses of "orange" color where the picture shows different colored designs interspersed w orange.
1,The box says it comes with batteries and a book it came with neither.
1,I bought both the 12 inch,and 8 inch version of this knife togeather. The 12 inch handle is much better than the 8 inch. The top of 8 inch handle the rose wood is raised not flush even with metal tang.needs to be sanded down. In comparison the 12 inch knife is expertly finished in same place. The metal is excellent on both knifes. The knifes were packaged seprate. So after I cut the heavy plastic encasement surrounding,the packaging I could then see the sloppy craftsmanship. So someone in Switzerland was lax on this point! Knowing that some time I can sand it my self,I will. It will be a delicate endeavor, if I want to equal the comfort of my 12 inch same model knife.
1,I should have paid attention to the size I was ordering.  This is a super small cutting board.  So it is over priced, IMHO
1,Did not fit my vacuum and was pretty much useless.
1,In looking back and seeing what I paid for this box one would find at The Dollar Store, I am so disappointed.  Was in a nursing home when I ordered it and must have been quite sedated not to notice.  Well too late now!  Just beware it is what it is-worth about a dollar!
1,Waste of money - does not work!
1,We didn't get to open the furniture right away because this was supposed to be a present for Christmas and one given us Christmas to press send I guess just by sitting in the box that long in the packaging it develop some type of fungus that grow around the table wouldnt area and whatever chemical to use he came off it was flaking off and all the little flaking Dennis was airborne in the air so it wasn't safe for us to keep it I gave it to my wife as a person I set a price break on because she want to be stable for many years and unfortunately shes not able to enjoy it or Im not able to  Make her happy with this were going to have to throw it away since they refuse to take it back and it was probably my fault for not opening the furniture right away because I have a feeling that this came like that I don't think you develop any fungus on the box while sitting on my garage why because my garage its atmosphere control temperature I have a great garage I have sensitive things in the garage and I have to have a temperature about 68 to 72 so its not too hot not to call is just perfect environment perfect Ambien so there is no way they couldve developed moisture fungus on any material unless this fungus already Its on safe for my children and for my parents to have their fungus around even if we wipe it off I tried to contact the company for if they refuse to take it back with me and I cant do nothing with it Im gonna have to destroy it
1,it is not what i thought it would be not even the right color
1,So disappointed! This piece came with several cap screws which had plastic threads. Unfortunately, the one that holds the drawers in  was metal, rendering the entire piece completely useless. Returning is an an absolute nightmare because the piece weighs 100 pounds.		UPDATE: trying to get replacement part so I can keep the cart...HORRIBLE customer service so far from Home Styles. They want pictures of the damaged part - as if I, the customer, need to prove that their crappy workmanship is actually garbage. And they do NOT answer the phone. You are sent straight to a voicemail in the GENERAL mailbox. So unimpressed with this company right now!!!		FINAL UPDATE: Finally received the replacement part and Finished constructing the cart. Put the drawers together, and they are not sized properly.  They will not close. Also, the edge of one of the fronts of the drawers is damaged. This could be such a great kitchen cart, but not only is it poorly pieced out, the customer service is awful. NOTE If you do not buy it directly from Amazon, they will not replace your parts. Buyer beware! I will never buy another Home Styles product.
1,They will take no twisting, the wood separates, the springs half fall off. The phrase 'tin fiddle' comes to mind. These might be good for very light duty clothes hanging and so long as there is no wind.
1,I tried to make bread crumbs using this chopper.  Apparently, that's too much for it to handle.  The crumbs never got small enough, and the blade actually appears blunted from stale bread.  How cheap must that steel be if bread crumbs are harder than the cutting surface??		I was able to puree plum tomatoes using this chopper, but could only fit about half a can at a time.  A real blender was a much better solution even for this minor task.  For things like chopping onions, the amount of time I saved using this chopper seemed to be offset by having to clean it afterward, since I'm usually only chopping up 2-3 onions.  If I were chopping more onions than this, then a full sized food processor would be much more convenient anyway.  I'll stick to my trusty kitchen knife for such chopping.		Overall, I'd recommend buying a real food processor or blender if you need one.  I've yet to find the niche that this thing is supposed to fill, and it will likely spend allot of time on my shelf.
1,Delivered it said "family size"..I live alone and wanted something small. Did a piece of cod, going by directions...dry. Did french fry,going by directions, came out brown,not golden. Just did one chicken thigh and although it called for 19 minutes, took it out at 9 mins, still too dry. Not close to the one I had before (Presto 05470) that only lasted me about a year, but at least ya can cook with it. Also, takes a whole bottle of oil just to get to the lowest level and ya can't cook with the top on!
1,I have a 16 month old and when she sets in it she is too big for it and she is an average 16 month old according to her dr. This was a waste of money the chair is way too little
1,I decided to buy this tea kettle because it got so many wonderful reviews.  It is a beautiful looking kettle, heavy, as described and seems of good quality.  However the first time we used it the whistle didn't work.  I had to nudge it to get it to whistle-----not good!  It isn't a loud whistle either so wouldn't be heard from other rooms-----which is important to us.  Also found it VERY awkward to pour.  The spout and handle/trigger don't seem lined up correctly, making the pour uncomfortable.  We are returning it.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product.
1,takes forever and not worth the wait, better off with a microwave and wetting towels for a minute over waiting an hour for this crap.
1,Bought these at a local store. They would not stay tight on the can. Leaked. Never could use them.
1,Amazing cup keeps my ice water cold all day plus.  I fill this cup up with ice and water at about 6:00 am and it's still mostly ice when I go to bed.  There is even still ice in the cup the next morning.  Not sure what science magic makes this happen, but it's hands down the most insulated cup I've ever used.  The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is that after only a month or so of use, the cup lid has lost its ability to form a good seal.  This doesn't affect the insulation abilities of the cup, but it does make it so that every time I take a sip, some liquid seeps out around the poor seal making it virtually unusable.  I have hand washed my cup and lid every time, so it's not like it got damaged in the dishwasher.  For such an expensive cup, it's very disappointing that it doesn't have a better lid.		Updating my review: After much frustration with the leaking lid, I ordered another Yeti replacement lid.  Same exact problem right out of the package.  This cup is great, but without a lid that works, it's useless as a travel cup.  Completely unacceptable for such an expensive cup.  Trying another (more affordable) brand.
1,I sent back the first one because steam would not come out of the wand.  I have kept the second one, but the cap does not seal well and makes a loud, high pitched whistle when it brews.  It's loud enough to wake the entire house up.
1,I was disappointed when this arrived.  The picture makes it appear more golden than the actual product.  I'm sure there are better options.
1,Product is made of cast iron skillet.  When it arrived, the handle of the pan had broken off.  It was packaged extremely poorly (from the manufacturer, not the shipping packaging). The cardboard box it was packaged in did not support the weight of the skillet.  The skillet itself, was also much lighter than a cast iron skillet of that size should have been, which also makes me wonder about the quality of the product.		In short, this should be an extremely sturdy product - cast iron lasts a long, long time.  This product, however, couldn't last from manufacturing through shipping.
1,OK...you'd think I would have learned this lesson by now but apparently not. If it sounds too good to be true, it IS!!! These sheets are supposed to be 400 thread count, 100 percent cotton. For the price I didn't expect high quality cotton, but I did expect the real thing. They are flimsy and are definitely NOT cotton.  They feel like microfiber. They don't breathe like cotton - be prepared to sweat because it's like sleeping with a polyester blanket. So disappointed. Will never buy from this seller again.
1,The bottle is detective on all 4 sides. I'm so disappointed.
1,Returned the first then the second was not centered. I didn't bother doing anything with it. I at least know never to buy this type of product online.
1,I have a lot of problems with this product. First off, it ships from China. The tracking number provided didn't work, and it took about 3-4 weeks to arrive. Secondly, it doesn't\ even work as advertised, because a hot liquid will mostly uniformly heat the mug, and so the whole battery icon will be green. Even with only 1/4 cup of very hot liquid, the battery icon is still mostly green, only vaguely less at the top. Also, this is not dishwasher safe at all. Everything peeled off after 1 wash.
1,Just okay and very over priced. I think this is only worth half of what they're charging. For the price II was expecting much more... the picture should have been more realistic and more vibrant in color.
1,It sounds funny to be excited about a new toaster but I truly was! I eat an English muffin for lunch everyday. I like mine more golden and crispy rather than doughy. This toaster toasts evenly but on the highest setting does not toast enough for my liking. I have to set it at at the lowest setting then when it pops up reset to a medium setting. I thought, okay at least I know how to get it toasted to how I like it. But after 4 months it just really annoys me. The other thing that annoys me is if you want to check on how your toast is doing or pop it early you really have to unplug it. When you unplug it the toast flies right out of the slots! You can pull the lever up but not easily and it just feels like eventually something will break.	So off to Goodwill with you. I just purchased the Chefman for almost twice as much and hopefully will be toasting happily with it for many years!
1,2nd as gift. Purchased to replace 20yr. old Ecko unit used daily to preheat coffee thermos/mugs. Cannot use with out it boiling over, all the way down to med. heat, now taking twice as long to heat my water, though the cleanup is more contain-able. After 2 months of daily use, on a lower,slower heat setting than the  20 year old kettle used, the bottom of the kettle had stretched, and now "pops" in and out, like poor auto body panels while using the same properly functioning stove top.
1,Perfect! Much better than my old kettle. It's not too heavy, and I like the fact that it's all stainless steel on the inside. Simple design that does exactly what you want.	Update: It's been just over a month since I bought it, and I discovered rust inside, near the top at the back of the kettle. Customer service have agreed to send me a replacement, so hopefully it won't happen again. Bumping this down to three stars for now.	Update: After a few days of use, the replacement started to rust, in the exact same spot as the previous one. Too bad - this would have been a great kettle otherwise. I've bought a Breville instead, as I had better luck with that in the past.
1,I ordered an 8x10 and received two 8x5. I didn't even bother to take it out of the box once I read the packaging slip. Instant return for refund.		There reasoning is that the pieces come in set sizes and they will ship multiple to "make up" a size
1,It leaks
1,Thin, cheap fabric and poor quality. Threw right in the trash.
1,These are not at all high quality and are hardly "hermetic." It's no wonder water dripped out of two of them.  First, the lids do not sit squarely on all the jars and one side is higher and not sealing:  you can even see the a gap between the seal and the glass.  Second, the seal material is cheap, slightly rough, and dirt or other material is imbedded within it, making for poor sealing conditions.  Third, the rim of the glass has some rough areas that could cause leaks.  Fourth, the glass itself is thin and light weight.  Fifth, the metal that puts pressure on the lids to hold it down is cheap, light weight, bends easily and is going to break at some point.		These are a terrible choice for anything needing to stay completely airtight.  I'm going to return them and find something good.	Made in China.
1,Worked for one charge, now will only work 30 seconds on a full charge. Would not buy again or recommend. Doesn't pick up any dog fur to speak of, total waste of $.
1,I got the bag and pannier system from a local shop. The bag itself is great. I don't like the pannier attachment. The angle is very awkward and I dislike having to sacrifice a side of my rack to this one bag. I tried attaching the pannier hooks to the bag itself and that didn't really work either. Finally I made a set of attachment loops out of some spare webbing and backpack clips, and that seems to be more workable. Really great grocery bag, lousy pannier holder. The one benefit is the plastic bit that goes against the Bike and keeps the bag stiff.  That works well.
1,I should have read other people's reviews because the darn bag did NOT came with beans!!! Freakin rip off for that price without beans. I had to spend another $25 to have enough beans to fill the bag. Can't return it since after my kid saw it and liked the print.
1,It was a decent simple table until my puppy jumped on it - I don't know what the heck the dang thing just cracked and fell apart I cannot even figure out how to remotely mend it -  am very disappointed
1,I would give this much higher rater, however I purchased TWO identical models at the same time, shipped as one shipment and warranties, and I cannot tell which one to write up the bad review for. One of these machines has the AUTO FAN function. The other is totally different! It has NO Auto fan, so that when the humidity is reached or falls to a certain level, it doesn't change the fan speed automatically! One would have to sit and stare at it, or check on it now and then and pump up the fan speed! Also, on this same unit, the buttons are not blackened in like the other, so you know which button is fan, which is humidity and which is on and off button, like the other unit has! This tells me, one was manufactured somewhere else, whereas quality control was not checked once coming into the USA.It even has the manual without the Auto controls I would have sent this message to the seller directly, but the seller is Amazon, and there is no link to send a message on the invoice details. I will be returning it Monday along with the warranty purchased, once I can figure out which warranty goes to which unit!		Update: 12/9/2016: The other unit which has the auto function and painted buttons, unlike the one reviewed above is now giving us problems. The last day, the fan even while on auto, keeps revving up and down every few seconds but never reaching the targeted humidity. It revs for a few seconds, then slows down. Instead of gaining humidity percents, it keeps losing it. I have the feeling, both are going to be packed up and returned.
1,Sorry....did not like these...started smoking in my toaster
1,Way too small.. returned
1,OVERPRICED! These are twice as much as they should be.  I purchased mine from another website and paid basically $1 per plate which is all they are really worth, I use these for everyday kids/snack dishes.  shame on amazon for price gouging to this degree
1,The handle on this kettle is too long and too close to  the glass and it gets hot.  I sent it back and bought a different one with a shorter handle.
1,I read reviews about these falling apart when washing so I washed mine on the most gentle cycle....the stitching around the edges came out shredded in several areas... they also do not dry out very fast. OTHERWISE BEAUTIFUL!!!! I love how they go in my bathroom!!
1,I thought it would be a bit larger than it actually was and the inside is terribly cheap. I bought a thermal tote bag at Costco twice as large and far better quality for only $6.99.
1,Ran out of my favorite incense which I've been buying for decades and rather than schlep down to my little bookstore to get it I figured I'd order it easily through Amazon and for less.  This stuff is definitely not authentic.  It's way too sweet smelling.  I really can't stand it.  Real Nag Champa should be smooth, it has a very specific smell and this is not it.  Very disappointed.  If you like sweet, you might like it but don't fool yourself thinking this is authentic Nag.  Will definitely not make this mistake again.
1,I was so happy with the picture advertised with bright clear colors. The real product looks nothing like the picture. Think of when you've blown up a pic so large it becomes extremely pixelated. Everyone who saw it laughed at how terrible it was. Needless to say I returned it and Amazon was wonderful about the return.
1,I threw mine away, placed it outside near garbage dumpster, product is no good.
1,Very nice size however the drilled holes do not match up. The package came with a dental pick taped in the sealed tape on top. So gross. I could not believe it. Very disturbing. Filing a complaint.
1,Dull and faded
1,Poor quality, rough unfinished edges. This 2018 purchase was so different from the one I purchased back in 2013. My 2013 purchase looked exactly like in the photo; Very good quality, stainless, smooth, heavy-duty, and priced only at $5.95 per set. I bought 3 sets of those, which I use for my hobby of making soaps and lip balms. I wanted to buy another set this time because my kitchen was getting jealous of the special treatment my soap-making and lip balm-making hobby was getting. Unfortunately, this time, the set did not live up to the expectation, even if I used a link from my previous 2013 purchase to reorder this but apparently this is a different vendor.  I am glad I only bought 1 set. Wont be buying these again.
1,Cheap cheap cheap and CHEAP...I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing his product. Ive bought stuff from the flea market with higher quality than these sheets. Plus They have a stain smh.
1,The reason for buying projection clock is so I could project the time on the wall.  I projected alright but backwards.......  Not good.
1,Don't get me wrong, if you're going to build it and leave it in place it's great.  Once you go to move it it's a nightmare, you take all the shoes off and it still falls apart and parts break.  Glue it when you put it together (it's timely) or buy something else.
1,A friend of mine had gotten one of these, (I'm not sure from where), and was telling me how much she enjoyed it. I was looking forward to trying it myself. When it goe here, much to my sorrow it had not one, but two chips out of it. I was a little hesitant to use it since it was going to be in boiling water. I decided to give it a try but while standing well back from the stove.		I did take a couple of peeks. It did change color, but it was jumping around and shaking something fierce. My eggs came out...OK but I found I needed to add a couple of mins to get them fully done. This could have been the egg timer, or that I used large eggs. I may order another one (somewhere else) and try again.
1,If I had actually read what these were made of I would have run the other way. There is so much static caused by these table cloths every spec of everything sticks to them. If I could give these a minus 1000 stars I would. Didnt evan get past the first use. I think I might have thrown them away because i have no clue where they are and never want to see them again.
1,I definitely would not purchase these online. The Dollar Tree has them for a dollar each. Much better for the price!
1,Very comfortable, except after only a 2-3 months a huge patch of the fabric has started to pill badly. It really looks unsightly.
1,If this were just for display, it would be fine.  It looks reasonably nice, and it was nice that it came with the pillows.  I'm keeping the pillows and shams and chucking the comforter (which was meant to replace a similarly colored silk one that has gotten old).  Considering the price, it's not bad.  However, I couldn't sleep with the comforter anywhere near me on my bed.  It was quite scratchy and unpleasant.  If I were just using this to put in a guest bedroom that wasn't used much, or to stage a house, it's a pretty good value.  The pillows and other accessories alone are probably worth the price.
1,Beware --the photo does not display the real color of these--they are a vibrant neon green color --the edges are not even and I am very disappointed!
1,made in china!!!!!
1,This will not work in a drafty space. I live in an old apartment with bad insulation. this heater will only heat a small space, with the door closed, if the door is cracked at all you will not feel much of anything.  Perfect for a small bedroom or bathroom but a living space like a living room you need something bigger or you will need to put the heater right up on you.
1,I read the reviews on these tins before buying them and was expecting to be quite happy with them.  This is one of the rare times that Amazon reviewers have let me down.  The  magnetic on these tins is pretty weak and the lids aren't the best.  Save your money and buy something else.
1,It's too high for my drawers so I can't close them.
1,WOULDN'T FIT MY UNIT
1,Not what I expected, takes too long to register temp.
1,Entirely too small and not as sparkly as I hoped. Super disappointed
1,I liked the product initially because the bristles don't curl with use like regular nylon material. However, the bristles are quite brittle and many of them would break off during use, eventually the brush head became bald. I am afraid the broken bristles might also cause a blocked sink drain.
1,It's so small very difficult to chop up things. For the price of this item you could buy a larger chopping board, didn't realize it was going to be this tiny.
1,I just got this today, I was going to use it to make small amounts of rice to add to my dogs dinner. I put it in rice I put in about twice as much water and I put it in the microwave. I've used similar products though my charger with no problem so I figured this would work just fine. Since all the instructions are in Chinese there's no way to know for sure. I think I just put it on too long. Suddenly there was smoke coming out of my microwave, and then the microwave shut off due to the safety feature. I pulled the rice cooker out, and shoved it in the sink. After looking at it I could see that the bottom had melted almost completely through. Like I said this was probably my fault I should have anticipated that the smaller steamer wouldn't have to cook nearly as long do not put in for 10 minutes, sure you have plenty of water.
1,Didn't love this, the water pushed to the back when laid on, didn't support neck as I hoped.
1,Lid is too loose. Would not buy again.
1,I have to say that I have found nearly everything I've bought from InterDesign as sub-par.  I've returned everything I've bought except for this.  The only reason I kept it is because I found a way to make it stay.  There is no tension in this caddy.  I put it together and put it in my stand up tile shower.  I couldn't get the thing to expand and stay taught.  I don't know why everyone has done away with the spring tension rods because those worked well,  They are now into the twist and turn tension and I think it's awful.  This tension rod has no grip on the tile and if I pull a washcloth from it, it would fall onto me.  I finally had to prop it up behind my shower curtain rod and drilled a stopper around the pole into my tile to keep it from slipping.

I received my order today, which was "shipped and sold" by Amazon directly, and it is a FAKE. It came with a Cincinnati Reds logo and the word "Premium" under it. (WHAT THE?!) When you inspect it further, there are a host of problems. I have another YETI Rambler to compare it to, side by side. The weight is off. The knock-off is much lighter. The grain of the metal is terrible. The "E" on the  lid isn't correct (the mid-line should be shorter than the top and bottom line). The insert should be matte finish; it is glossy. The kerning (spacing) on the word "comfortably" on the label is off. I am really bummed because it was sold by Amazon, not a third party!
1,I haven't noticed any difference with this product. I have it right next to my stove so it can help absorb the food smell.
1,I purchased my 2nd one of these coffee pots in 11/13.. less than 6 months later it is not working. I am very disappointed i the quality. My last version of this lasted 3 years.  The features are great the quality proved to be poor.
1,Cheap material returned it
1,Even this picture shows an embossed glass. They are just plain. Save your money. They look and are cheap.
1,The frame is very cheaply made.  The corners are stapled together. As soon as I put the picture in and stood it up, one of the corners came completely apart.  I have a stapler that does thick paper and was able to staple the corner back together.  It's just for a document so I am not going to waste my time returning.
1,Barely used as I live alone and drink 2 cups of coffee a day.  I have had it for 6 months and it stopped working.  KitchenAid says this model is out of warrenty, even though it comes with 1 year warrenty.  Amazon says they can't replace it because I have had it 143 days.  Ordinarily, if not completely happy with a purchase I just suck it up.  But this time I feel ripped off.  Not happy.
1,I put two of these next to my litter boxes and one in my car. I haven't noticed a single bit of difference.
1,Not purple,  more like fuschia, NOTHING like the photo, not even close and makes me doubt these are a photo of the actual product, more like some stock photo.  Good thing they were cheap because we will not be using them.
1,We bought $1200 worth of grass fed beef and a brand new deep freeze so we thought we better get a alarm since we keep the freezer in our basement.  One alarm is for the freezer and the other is only for the fridge since you can't set the alarming beeper for low enough for another freezer.  We bought the special lithium expensive batteries figuring we want to do everything possible to protect the meat.  It was a little hard to find a place in the house it would read the sensors and we would hear the alarm beep.  But we finally ended up having to put the alarm unit in our bedroom since that is basically on top of the freezer.  It worked erratically for 2 months, would alarm about once every 10 days and say the temp went up 20 degrees when nobody opening the door or anything, never figured that out but then about a week ago it just stopped working.  We reset it, changed the $10 batteries, stood right next to the freezer and no matter what we do it won't work.  So this product ended up being a big waste of time and money.  Not sure if it can be returned after 2 1/2 months or not.
1,Very poor craftmanship.  The inside had a sharp, round dent where medicine could get caught up in. The box was flimsy, and it is made in China. This is NOT a good quality morter. I read most of the reviews, and they were positive despite the fact that the manufacturing of this product is done in China.  So, I gave it a try...and now I'm sending it back. It has a dent!  Where is quality control ???!!!
1,Doesn't appear to be an original keurig k-cup holder, the pin is rounded, not sharp. It takes some force to close the lid. The original holder has a painted white arrow like the one in the picture. I don't recommend this holder.
1,Ugly!
1,So I kind of hate to give this coffee maker a bad review because I may have just gotten a dud. The coffee actually tasted very good. (I made a batch the night before, didn't drink it and let it sit in the machine over night, dumped it out in the morning, made a new batch and drank that.) The problem was that the coffee leaked out of the part where the bottom and top of the espresso maker attach. I closed it very tight and it leaked anyway. Steam also escaped out of every possible place it could and the lid was difficult to flip up with your thumb. It was hot from the steam and too smooth to flip. For less than $14 bucks it was certainly worth a try. I was tempted to order another one just in case the one I got was a dud but I opted for a different and more pricey one. Hope that one works out.
1,After following the standard airing out memory foam instructions, the pillow is uncomfortable. Way too hard for a side sleeper.
1,This is an from O trading  company.  I really do not like getting anything from them and I am not really happy about getting this cheaply made product.	Please subtract the single star.
1,A huge hard to get off sticker adorns this basket. Why they put these on I have no idea. Basket looks cheap being plastic but will work ok for keeping outdoor shoes in it and out of the house. Not attractive for an indoor piece.
1,Looks great but it didn't work well. We have since replaced it with another.
1,my experience not so good. four out of five sent the lids don't seal. They wash ok however, a lot of money for something that doesn't	 work that well,
1,For the price I would expect it to be a much higher quality.  The vinyl is very thin.  The quality is about the same as a very inexpensive vinyl raft for your pool... $16 for a twin XL is a high price for this level of quality.  The description does state up to 9" thick mattress.  It does seem sized properly... just very thin compared to most mattress covers on the market.
1,I bought one of these several years ago. It is a good solution for measuring sticky stuff, like honey. There are several problems, however. It is not dishwasher safe. The printing is wearing off even though it is only washed by hand. It does not slide easily, requires a lot of elbow grease to extract the honey. But, it is still a better solution than using regular measuring cups. Next time, I'm looking for dishwasher safe as a minimum requirement.
1,I purchased this table runner for my daughters birthday party. I recieved my order the day before her party.....only to find a completely empty package. Unless its invisible, someone MAJORLY dropped the ball. Awesome. *eye roll*
1,I used it for a week and returned it.  The idea of vertical steaming was too much of an effort.  I wish I could use this horizontally on my iron board but we cannot.  It is on its way to Amazon.
1,chemical odor for first day. then you must put  your nose right up to it to smell anything. garbage. waste of money. better off with essential oils/candles. too bad. was really hoping for something that doesn't require daily attention
1,I was hoping for the best. I love the look of this product online but like others said, it is cheap looking. It is made of plastic but I was still willing to look past it. The first one I received, one of the glass on the panels was broken so I asked for a replacement. Received the replacement and once again, broken glass on the exact same panel.
1,This rug has a strong, noxious chemical smell. The quality is amazingly poor. Even while still in its plastic wrapper, the rug had pilling and there were several snags in its looping.  Don't waste your time and effort ordering this.
1,I washed it and it fell apart, HORRIBLE, DONT BUY .
1,I really, really wanted to like this bag...but there are so many things that just don't work.	1.  It's big, and can hold a lot of stuff (PRO)....but it's one handle completely negates the benefit of that.  Impossible to move when full withour everything consistently flopping over.	2. As a locker-room purchase, the material just didn't seem to "release" the water quickly or well.  Sat kind of stinky in the locker, so that'snot a good fit.	3. Might use this on an upcoming cruise since it folds well and is light, but I don't expect to move it...and I probably won't bring it home.
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. I received this as a gift. It is large and very pretty. The pre heat is very strange with no good explanation. But, the oven door is not closing completely so therefore all the heat is escaping. Only having it for a few months, I called customer service and after a 15 minute wait, I was told that my registration of product was not for warranty but for marketing purposes.  I have to pay over $50 to return oven to them and upon receipt they will send me another one....don't know if it would be new or a refurbished. I will never buy another Cuisinart product due to this treatment and their customer service policies.  THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ONE OR YOU WILL BE USING TAPE TO KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED LIKE I NOW WILL HAVE TO DO.
1,Too small,  magnets are not hold strongly. I cannot recommend to use this product  for kitchen towels because of the small size and weak magnets.
1,The names were misspelled, overall quality of material was nice. I ended up returning.
1,This product functions but very uncomfortable design. I am 5 foot 8 inches and not so tall. It covers only 3/4th the back and there is no support for the head. In the photos, it look big enough but really now. I used it at-least for 8 hrs before i decided to return this item. Please don't buy!		Amazon basics - I am having a mixed result. The products are sourced more on cost but low on quality. Use and throw items can be brought on Amazon basics but
1,Ok for the money..nothing special.not bad for a spare room
1,I don't trust my guy so good to know I can always double check	Update scale stopped working after 2 months maybe been used 7xs it does not read anything under 30g now
1,My husband has one leg amputated so when he showers he may loose his	balance. We have three grab bars, but occasionally he grabs the shower curtain	if he looses his balance. The other shower curtain rings  had merely bent when	this would happen. But when I installed these hooks and he lost his balance and	grabbed the curtain, four hooks snapped right off the shower rod. They looked like	they were heavy duty, but failed the test. I would not recommend them.
1,Bottom rusted in a few weeks.  Maybe it's because I live in such a humid climate in Hawaii.  It didn't last very long, only a couple months before I had to throw it away.  Pump worked fine.
1,MELTED IN NO TIME AT ALL. USED IT 3 TIMES. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
1,I found this to be poorly painted and amateurish.  It looks as if someone were cranking out 100 of these a day. Seen as a small painting on Amazon, the triptych lookes wonderful, and perhaps the first one was. But the acrylic paint was thinly applied and any suggestion of grace or movement was obliterated by the choppy brush strokes. The tree spread across the panels is a woebegon stiff brown line apparently executed with a child's stiff paintbrush. This is not worth stretching over a frame.
1,The vacuum head may be all right, but the machine is useless to me because the handle, though it does have a connector to the machine,  will not fit securely into the head.  I could not get it to "click in place", so it fell off with the slightest movement.  Also, the handle would bend only one way--not two, as the brochure says.  I called to complain, and the company sent me a new handle, but when it came, it even lacked the connector on the first one.  The whole thing was just a waste of time, really.  I wish I had never ordered this.
1,small
1,COULDN'T RETURN IT!
1,Returned
1,They don't even really look like a real candle even though they dipped them in a thin coat of wax. I hate the thin coat of wax by the way, its totally unnecessary unless you need to feel them & its so thin it starts to flake off & crumble if they get bumped or dinged for any reason.  The biggest issue...only way to turn these on & off is by screwing the battery cap which I thought was doable before I bought these. I was so wrong! The springs are so strong in the battery compartment that when they are lossened to turn off, its not tight enough to keep the 2 pieces together. What happens is they will pop off the candle stand or if you have them laying down the bottom cap will fly off somewhere. So the only way to turn off some of the candles is to totally remove the bottom battery cap & lay it down. I have had 3 out of 12 that pop off the stands every day & of course they get dinged or roll off the table so the wax coating looks aweful! I should have bought the really pricy candles that look better & are remote controlled without losing battery power when off. In this case I got what I paid for & regret it every single time I look at these candles. Please learn from my mistake.
1,Doesnt work well, not what I expected!	But I do like the additionals!
1,Geez- another cookie cutter that is way too small. Disappointed to say the least. If there was an option not to give a rating star, I'd take it.
1,Arrived undamaged. Followed instructions for setting machine up and did all the required steps. Used it and tried to make a decent espresso and no luck at all. Espresso came out like strong coffee from a drip maker. Machine would not froth milk at all came on and off for no reason. Machine night make a good door stop but as for coffee forget it. I needed a espresso machine for work but I guess the quest will continue.
1,Ive used other carpet cleaners and this just doesn't seem to live up to the reviews. I had to try to go over the same spot mutiple times and the spot was there still after my 4th attempt.
1,This bean bag is very big and not soft at all.
1,i originally gave this product a 3 b/c i couldn't get the bucket to freeze,,, after i lowered the temp in my freezer the bucket froze and made some great gelato, so i changed it to a 5 and said it was great,,, well i'm now on my 3rd batch of gelato and neither the 2nd batch nor this 3rd will freeze and turn to gelato.  i don't know what is wrong but i'm not happy,,, this product is crap and i should have stuck with my instinct on the 1st review instead of listening to the smartass that tried to tell me i was doing something wrong.  its crap do not buy
1,wasn't as described.
1,We had this vacuum for 6 months, with light use, and the motor just died.  Manufacturer's warranty is for 90 days.  We bought this vacuum for use on the hard floor surfaces of our townhouse to pick up kitty litter, dust and fur.  It was perfect while it worked, and I was so happy... but serious - 6 months later and the motor just suddenly dies in the middle of use.  This is the first Hoover I've purchased and it will be the last.  I've had Dirt Devils and Eurekas for years with only loss of suction being the problem.  I even passed up a cheaper Dirt Devil because I focused on the positive reviews here.  Listen to the negative ones... honestly.  It's a poorly made product with a horribly short warranty.  It's great while it lasts but $150 is hardly worth 6mos of use.
1,It is a beautiful color but is a little large on my daughters twin bed
1,After a few months, the protector rips.  Not for long term usage.
1,These candles melt very quickly despite their size. The photo shows how melted they were after only 2.5 hours. Not recommending this for people wanting a nice slow burning candle. It must be low quality wax or extra soft, or something, that makes them liquify so quickly.
1,ITS SMOKE AROUND THE KNOB
1,Lids don't stay sealed.
1,These are absolutely terrible! It worked fine the first time I used it. Then after that I got half of my coffee grounds in my cup. And it's probably because the lid doesn't fully seat the cup. Hate it. Don't buy it.
1,They held up but they weren't what I wanted/expected. Lots of balling up
1,I gave this to my son for Christmas and he got a new house and tried to have a cup of coffee with it for the first time and nothing happened!? Didn't warm up it did nothing. He waited 20 mins still nothing. Unplugged it and plugged it back in still nothing! A brand new coffee maker and it doesn't work!! Ridiculous!!
1,There's definitely some steam, but the steam alone wasn't enough to clean sticky or dried dirt. If I let the steamer sit on the spot for a very long time, it might soften it, but I can do exactly the same thing with my mop. Also, a quick pass of steam doesn't disinfect, it needs a full 8 seconds for every spot, as the instructions say. After about a year, right out of warranty, the whole thing died.
1,Would not buy again.  Ends of the bag split open too easily.
1,Too flimsy. It is so light weight that it blows into the shower. Replaced with a thicker guage shower curtain.
1,I bought the "Extra Large Garment Bag" and within a few days it was no longer vacuum sealed. I use vacuum bags religiously, I know how to seal these bags, there's no reason this one should've unsealed unless there's a defect in the bag.
1,Firstly, there are no grommets at the top - just slits (unfinished) in the fabric. Secondly, it is certainly not "full" on a shower/tub combo. Unlike the picture, it hangs flat across the opening. Lastly, the material seems rather thin and cheaply made. Would not purchase again.
1,I guess I'll start with the "pros".  I like the shape and the narrow tip.  This was one of the reasons I opted for this iron.  It glides nicely over fabric.  That's all I can say that's nice.  I cannot believe how much "spitting" this iron does.  I will experiment with different settings to see if I can get this under control but for now, it's very frustrating.  I realized that there wasn't an automatic cord winder but I didn't expect that the design didn't have any provision for neatly wrapping the cord.  At this price point, there could have been something designed at the bottom of the iron to wrap the cord when the iron isn't in use.  Overall, I don't think this was worth the extra investment.
1,The only benefit I could see about these, is if you often have eggs that are hard to peel, then this might help you.	You can have a different look to your hard boiled eggs, and you can add ingredients and cook them into the egg. You can also hard boil egg mixes. But the effort of using these is far greater than peeling normal hard boiled eggs, and clean-up is much more trouble than cleaning a single fry pan or pot.	Maybe we could paint these and turn them into Christmas tree ornaments.
1,it was tiny not sure what kind of flag fits it it but not a standard one
1,i have used it twice.	pressure mechanism is better than most out there, but food stuck on bottom and got burnt.
1,The lip on the lids have torn apart already can I get replacement lids?
1,A little disappointed with this  candle. My experience has always been amazing with Yankee candle, but this time around I am not super happy. You could barely smell any scent whatsoever. I buy Yankee candle because it's the best. It always was. This one I am not so thrilled with.
1,It worked for about 2 months but i had to keep changing the batteries in it. Then it stopped working just under 90 days of purchase.
1,rusted quick
1,I bought 2 of these for my GF for valentines day. While she loves the color and look of them, one of the products completely crumbled apart. We managed to make it look semi decent with some glue but we cant light/move it anymore in fear that it will break apart again. The second one in the package wasn't as bad, but i can see its cracked in a few spots at the bottom.
1,It just didn't work for me. Didn't auto shut off. Only steamed for 5-6 minutes. It also didn't seem durable. Just not effective, safe and price was extreme for lack of quality. I ended up getting a Joy Mangano My Little Steamer set (Large and Travel steamer) for $19.95 on another site. It functions as it should and is durable.
1,If you are well-endowed and wear a bra with cups larger than an orange, this BraBall will not work for you. I filled mine with catnip toys so it works well to entertain the cat and that's the best thing I can say about it.
1,Looks flimsy ....have bought several knives in the past all failed. Giving one star for the look of it.
1,I got this machine not even a month ago as a gift and it stopped working yesterday.....it was fine while it worked but less than a month working is a shame!!!
1,difficult to install
1,I was really hoping this would be a fine addition to my kitchen collection of gadgets, but unfortunately, I was really let down by this frying pan. It says non-stick, but stuff actually sticks to it really easily - even when you use some extra oil or PAM to try and reduce it. It's also a  pain in the neck to clean compared to my other frying pans and skillets. I've had this pan less than a month and it is permanently stained. Finally, it's copper COLORED, rather than actually being made of copper, which is what a lot of people are thinking from how the Amazon page and Black & Decker are selling this. It's an aluminum pan with a little bit of titanium whose sub-par nonstick coating is copper colored. That's all		It's a visually appealing pan and I love that it is BFOA free, but you can get far better skillets and/or frying pans for  less than actually live up to their claims and hype. I'm very disappointed in this and unfortunately, most of the reviews here on Amazon are done by people who have only used the pan a few times (if that). The longer you use this, the more you'll see it doesn't hold up very well. Be careful when purchasing this.
1,Came damaged.  Thoroughly disappointed.  Super cheap quality (in look and feel) as it was delivered completely bent.... Save your money and buy a nicer quality rod from walmart or something for a bit more money.  I did that and it looks much better.  I was able to return this though so good job on the return policy.
1,I was sooooooo looking forward to getting	this pan.  I do not like "non stick" - don't	trust most coatings.		This arrived quickly - through Amazon Prime -		However, the surface coating is all uneven -	several areas look bubbled and there is a	chip in the coating on one end.  Doesn't	appear that Amazon shippers bothered to	Inspect the item before shipping.		The main reason I'm returning this is - even	though the cups are large - like a jumbo	muffin pan - they are a good 1/4" shallower	than my other Jumbo Muffin Pan.		I'm using the pan to bake egg/bacon "muffins"	in so want it to be deep and non stick.		Very disappointed.
1,It's nice when it works. The two lightbulbs it came with already burnt out. One each day so here it sits until I order some more online and hope that they don't burn out as well.
1,The pleated pieces on the cover did not stay sewed for only about a week.
1,IT HAS A HUGE YELLOW STAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT 4' X 4' THATS 4 FOOT BY 4 FOOT WHAT IS THE YELLOW STAIN ?
1,Little over 30 days which is over the time I can return. Dessert bowl come out of the dishwasher cracked all the way from side to side.
1,Miniature / short - coffee grounds went up and over the filter - what a mess!
1,I hate to be that guy. I hate to give bad reviews. I wanted to like this!!		I used this a few times and hoped each time would be better than the last. NAY. Not so. It's just not comfy. Is it me? It must be me. Did I get a bad product? Maybe I did. I looked at instruction on how to properly use this. No luck. Still not comfy. It's just too hard. Too stiff. Hurts my neck and pushes it too forward. Couldn't sleep with this. Didn't conform to my neck shape and just caused more discomfort.		The product seems to be made well, but engineered poorly, at least for my preference. Everyone seems to rave so highly of this pillow. Maybe I'm just weird.		I travel a lot. I mean a lot. Long flights. Long car rides. I need to be comfortable. I tried getting this as a portable pillow which would help me rest and fall asleep. Again, just too stiff for my liking. Moreover, this is terrible to carry around. Fairly heavy, and hard to compress to a smaller more travel friendly size. I contemplated leaving it on the plane because of how annoying it was to fit back in its travel bag. UGHH.		My friend had a cheap one he picked up from the drug store before a flight. Super soft! OH SO NICE! I envied his awesome find. I felt like a fool for getting this. To top it all off, his was about half the price. Half!		Again, maybe I'm just different. But my thought is that someone will have this same issue. Look for a softer one. Try one in a store. See for yourself what works best.		Hope this helps! Maybe Customer service can reach out to me and see what's going on. I'd appreciate any suggestions to make this experience better.
1,Tried 4 of these over a period of time.		The first one lasted 1 year, which was great for the price.	The second one lasted a few months.	The third on arrived broken so Amazon sent a replacement.	The fourth (replacement) one also arrived broken but we made it work by taking parts from an older humidifier.		Due to this declining  trend, we now use a different brand of humidifier.
1,I bought this as a step stool for our aging dachshund to jump onto our bed, and for that purpose it works well and looks pretty nice. However, when we received it, the hinges and hardware that hold the lid on were all ripped out of the wood and bent at weird angles and there was no way to repair it. I couldn't repackage it to send it back, so I just took the hardware off and left the lid sitting loose. Its ok, but at this price point Id expect a fully functional piece of furniture.
1,Very disappointed. Pitcher is extremely thin like other posters say. Mine is intact after several uses but I'm just waiting for it to break. The lid did not fit the pitcher and had to be "coaxed" into the top of the pitcher. I like really strong tea and this fails. I have put various brands and ever-increasing amounts of tea into the steeping chamber and it doesn't taste like good tea. 10 individual bags are about the most that"ll fit, or 3 family-sized bags. They all come out cloudy and bland.
1,So so, about what you might expect for the price.  The material is thin, the bottom is not flat.  Cleans up fairly well.
