0,It is working, not bad
0,Use it all the time when I have a rental car, easy to install and see the map on the iPod.  Will not fit a Ford Escape with CD slot on top of the dash.
0,Works very well. Takes a while to register with my ipod though
0,Great goggles but didn't work for me ... I like that the lenses are adjustable wide & depth... Great.... But on my smartphone when putting in the headset , the holder has no clips on the bottom , just on the top & is one whole piece & not split so on my smartphone the on & off button is right there in order to get the earphone plug to work on the left-hand side ... If I turn the smartphone over it turns the smartphone off & pushes the smartphone volume off also .. This review is too let people know the clip is only on the top of the holder ... My smartphone is a BLU R1 HD & I left the case on at the the time I used it... I would have chosen 5 Stars otherwise & a great price point
0,I've had the case for about 4 weeks now and I love it! It is a little difficult to get off but nothing crazy like some of these reviews. The color is amazing like a hot raspberry pink, I would definitely recommend!
0,This is my third one cause I love these battery packs. They charge everything that I need it too. Best battery pack that is on the market. They give you 6 more months of warranty free when you register the item. You will not be sorry when you buy this battery pack. Don't leave home without it.
0,What's not to like. You only pay for what you use. Bills can be as little as $12/month if you don't use much. I keep one as a backup phone (That's only$6/month with no usage).
0,Exactly what I was looking for. For sure stainless steel as it doesn't rust and is easy to clean. Works well for cooking. I just wish it wasn't grid style and was more like a grill with parallel bars.
0,Excellent case
0,Good quality cables built to last. I have been using them for months and they are still like new with a strong and secure connection.
0,The product looks durable and made well. I just realized though that it doesnt work for iphone 7 plus due to the dual camera. I cant get a picture without the black border since it is overlapping.
0,work fine.
0,Im pretty familiar with the repairs of iPhones. I fix others screen as a little side job, so I'm always on the hunt for a good quality screen for a price that the customer will enjoy. Let me tell you this company offers that, the screens they have fit flush for whatever phone it is and the quality is great. I love how it is all put together unlike other company who just cheap out on the screen and try to make up for it by giving you a free gift. I had one problem with tis company before, with a screen that had some defects to the display. However I was sent a refund and then a new which was perfect.
0,Nice screen protector.  Gave it 4 stars because it bubbles up on the sides a little when I put my case on.
0,It's orange and black and bouncy! Check out YouTube for the test videos. I did. I liked what I saw, and so I bought this case. It could use more orange, but is otherwise just fine.
0,worked as expected
0,Fits good
0,The Anker SlimShell is a great iPhone 6s case. If you are looking for sleek protection for your device, you will find it in this product. The cutouts on the case are perfect and allow a wide variety of accessories to be plugged in. The rounded corners provide plenty of drop and bump protection, and the material is first-rate, with plenty of cushioning. The only thing that is really missing is screen protection, but that is easily taken care of by getting Anker's GlassGuard screen protector:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iPhone-6-Screen-Protector-Anker-Premium-Tempered-Glass-Screen-Protector-for-Apple-iPhone-6-4-7-inch-9H-Hardness-and-Easy-Bubble-Free-Installation-Not-compatible-with-iPhone-6s/dp/B00ME0AD7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iPhone 6 Screen Protector, Anker Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Apple iPhone 6 (4.7 inch) 9H Hardness and Easy Bubble-Free Installation (Not compatible with iPhone 6s)</a>. (The GlassGuard does have a 6s option now)		To make this case an even better option is it's price. You can't beat this deal for the protection that it provides. I highly recommend this case for your iPhone 6s.		Note: Author was provided this case for testing and review.
0,Excellent phone. two thumps up
0,These are decent screen protectors. Helps reduce glare from sun. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they scratch pretty easy and ive gone through 2 in a month due to mass light scratches. Only use fiber cloth to wipe. They do the job nonetheless.
0,It's looking great with my iPhone 5s!
0,ok
0,Love it
0,holds my big note 2, secure and still strong after a year of use. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0,snaps on easy and still have access to all of the functions.  comes with alittle tool to take it off also.
0,Fits well but the pink color causes a pink hue to be cast on pictures when the flash is used. I've tried to shave the pink back by the flash but have not been successful in removing that problem. The case style though is fabulous. Will definitely buy again, but not in pink.
0,Like It
0,Nice screen protector fits the phone well.
0,worked good did get a tempered glass one for it
0,Product was same as described...cheap ....better quality and clearity....
0,Works great. love the protection. And no scratches like the plastic protectors
0,It JUST BARELY doesn't fit a 6S with an otterbox defender case on it. I love it otherwise though, and still use it to charge my watch every night. I plan on taking a dremel to it to see if I can get my phone to fit.
0,I think most of us that use these things have tried several. generally, i really like motorola, but my recent motorola bt ear bud died after 9 months of very light use so i thought i'd give plantronics a try. so far, so good: if feels solid (unlike my motorola commander one). standby battery life is great and the voice prompt that lets you know how much "talk time" you've got left is pretty accurate.	there is a slider on/off, volume control button and the answer/end call button.	my biggest pet peeve is the preset volume levels...there are only 3 available on the headset!?! with my samsung gs3, i can control the volume by increments, but the M165 only gives me 3 volume level options: 1, 5, max.		1. Sound quality is good (due to dual mic), but not quite as loud, clear and crisp as either of my motorola's (hx550, commandone).	2. Size and ergonomics are on par with the commandone. controls are simple and easy to use, and as far as bluetooth earbuds go, this one is very solid	3. Battery life is great for the size	4. Fit is fantastic, and the material they use for those in ear fit thingies are great: they really hold the earbud securely without any pain or excess pressure		I took off 1 star for the inability to step up/down the volume in the same increments as my phone. otherwise i'm pretty happy and as both my motorola's are dead, this is my 'goto' bluetooth ear piece.		One Month later...	Still working great, I really appreciate the quality of the materials that are used in the earbud, it still holds onto the headset very tightly.
0,This is, by far, the best Apple Watch charging dock for the price, IMO, and I've used a few.	The dock now has an exit for the Lightning cable on both right and left sides. Having only one exit on the last version was a glaring flaw. It's great to see they fixed that issue in this new iteration.
0,EXCELLENT
0,super
0,This is big and bulky but I love it.  The iPhone is so light that having this attached gives it some weight and security. The extra power is awesome. I can shoot pics all day and still have 100% of my phone battery left.
0,First, I would buy more from OEM. Initially I did receive the wrong charger but OEM resolved the problem by shipping the correct charger. Once I was able to speak with them the transaction to get the correct charger went well. I would suggest calling them by telephone if not able to get an email response after two days. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and the new part arrived swiftly. OEM seems to be a good company, just need to improve email response time, (in my case), I can't speak for others. The price was good, the item received was in tip top condition and now I'm happily using my charger pod.
0,The case is nice and for the price you can not beat it. The case is very snug and the kick stand is a very nice.
0,Works great!
0,Works with iPhone 6 Plus but not with my iPad.
0,Pros:	It's super small and looks like an hearing aid. That helps when im at work.	It charges fast.	I set my phone down and walked about 30 feet away and it worked. (but if a wall gets in the way there will be skipping)		Cons:	It's small and you can lose it easily.	Since the battery isn't very powerful I tend to carry the charger with me in my bag	It hurts just a tad in my ear when putting it in but once it's in i don't feel it till i remove it.	It's treble is high and it lacks decent bass but it does its job.
0,Very cool texture. However, after a couple months it began to wear out.
0,A good, but somewhat bulky wallet case.
0,Gracias
0,Works great don't have to worry about breaking the usb cover and it stays put with the magnet is a bit big so need to use it on a desk or counter
0,I bought this phone for my elderly Mom. It is easy enough for her to use. The cost is reasonable. The on line help and activation was fairly straightforward. I bought in New Mexico and was able to secure a Nebraska local phone number. That was my big concern.		The canned text messages are great. My Mom is sending text msg to everyone everyday and she enjoys getting a message back.		I looked at both Jitterbug and Consumer Cellular. I would have gone with consumer cellular except for the dock to charge the phone. My Mom would not be able to work the USB plug and having the dock is the one and only reason I chose Jitterbug. And I am glad. She has trouble with her fingers and she can charge the phone by setting in the dock.		My only suggestion and the only reason I dropped one star. There needs to be a way to add personalized canned texts. We wanted to set up a couple of text that my Mom and family would understand. For instance: FYI, Call when you have a chance vs Call me now.
0,Just received it a couple of days ago, and I must say, it is very helpful when driving! After 1) resting the base of it on the dashboard, I then  2) position the suction area at the end in the spot I want it, and after pushing the suction handle into place (which can be hard to do because it adheres to the windshield so well), the holder stays in place, even in heavy jolts.		Very, very good overall!
0,Nice product and easy to follow instructions for a nice clean installation. Take your time and use low heat from hair dryer for the edges.
0,great looking case but not very good for lens protection. Case gets slippery after some use.
0,Great phone case.  I carry 3 cards and a $20 bill with no problem.  Shopping is so easy.  Strap is a nice feature.
0,My older car only has one spot to plug a charger in (my mother's new car has two, and I wished mine did too!). With this dual USB Car Charger, I am now able to charge two things at one time.		Usually I just charge my phone in my car, but there are different times when I bring my iPad with me also, and I always have to switch the chargers back and forth so both devices get charged. Now, I can have them both plugged in at the same time.		This charger will charge anything that has a USB charger.		I would absolutely recommend this device for people who want to charge two things at a time in their car.
0,Have gotten so many positive comments.
0,So do you need a nice protective case for you iPhone? Well, this is the case for you. The case is made like an Otterbox just without the 2 piece plastic case. This is a 2 piece case whereas an Otterbox is 3 piece case.		After using the case for about a week, I have to say this is one of Anker's better cases to have. This isn't just some cheaply built case. You can tell that Anker took its time to make sure this case will protect a phone from a drop. There is just a few things that I dislike about the case but its nothing to bad. The first issue is that the screen protecter on it has to come off it you are using a tempered glass screen protecter. If you do decide to take the screen protecter off make sure you also take off the glue. Because like me I took it off and left the glue on thinking it wasn't that strong of glue but it was. I had to take the case off of my phone for one day and I had issues taking it off because the glue stuck to my tempered glass screen protecter. And I get you can guess what happened. When getting it off it broke my tempered glass screen protecter. So if you are wanting to use this case with a tempered glass screen protecter make sure you take off the glue off. The second issue is that the cover for the head phone jack and the charger port covers are hard to close after you open them. You have to push the cover down and make sure they are lined up with the port.		Some things that Anker can do to make this case better is to offer different colors and make it where you can just buy 2 pieces in the different colors. Just like you can with the Otterbox.		I would recommend this case to anyone that is looking to get a protective case for their new iPhone 6 or 6 Plus.
0,The screen worked great and there were no issues installing it, usually I run into issues around the camera, but in this case it worked great.
0,It is a great case and protection for the phone.  I have used for over a year already.
0,fine
0,Used for a history class that my grand daughter was taken.  The pins used to hold in ton the wall left little holes.
0,Beautiful protector for the S6 edge. The phone is very nice looking, and the case does not take away from the looks of the phone. I also appreciate that the case also protects the camera lens when you lay the phone flat. A++
0,This cover fit and lasted longer than any cover I have used.
0,Nice case really liked it
0,First one I bought the phone did not work for calling.  The second one I bought was better but never got a great signal or GPS strength.  Was told it was because it's a older phone and can not support the newer updates.  Wish I had now  before spending the money. Gonna miss my note4 it was my favorite phone by far!!!
0,Over all a good value. Will see how the case holds up over time. I like how you can either clip the case on to your belt or slip a belt through the loops on the case.
0,This has lasted a good min now and its still working great!!! Would deff re-purchase
0,We ordered these for our Uniden phones which were no longer holding a charge. This saved us the expense and bother of purchasing new phones for the house, and having to insert all our phone contacts into another phone. The price was $4.33 a phone, so well worth it.  Just remember the first time to charge them (Obviously while newly inserted into the phones) the full 15 hours before using them in order to lengthen their battery life.
0,Seems to work out the socket easily. Find my phone quits charging then have to reset charger. Not a fast charger
0,This is exactly was I was looking, it has a very snug fit, so I don't have to worry about it sliding out too easy.  Some reviewers have had a problem with this but, its perfect for me.
0,aaa

0,This is a great looking case and also provide good protection from minor drops and bumps. The case fits the Nexus 6P very well the camera cut out has been fix from the original model that covered the laser focus.  The cut outs for the charger and headphones are a good fit. My only complaints are the cut out for the fingerprint sensor could be a hair bigger (but I have no problems as far as the phone reading my finder) and the silver frame around the charging port cut out sticks out just a little and get caught on my pocket when I take it out of my pocket. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.
0,Got this for my daughter. Very well built and classy. The bow sticks out and actually makes it easier to hold. Rinestones very secure so you don't have to worry too much about them falling off. Overall this was a big hit. Highly recommend.
0,works great!
0,product is good -- satisfied
0,So far so good. An option for an extended handle would be nice but works good.
0,Very durable.
0,I was skeptical about this case. I'd been admiring it back when I had my 5S and I've since upgraded to a 6 Plus, I had never owned a "wallet" phone case before. I started out with one from another site for the same price but could only hold three cards. I decided I needed more space because like most people I own more than just three cards that I use on a daily basis. Seeing as this case could hold double that of any other on the market, I sprang immediately for this one. I compared this to a bunch of other wallet cases I'd seen, and none of them even came close to the amount of storage this case supposedly had. So, I decided to go for it. And I'm so glad I did.	The case showed up five days after I ordered it and I was pretty surprised it arrived that quickly. I bought the turquoise one and the color in real life is true to the picture. The quality of the case is nice and sleek, and I don't find it slippery at all. It is supple and soft and nice to hold in hand. The real test though was how many cards it could hold.	I chose the cards I use every day and put them in the case. 6 cards, and I threw in a 5 dollar bill just to see if it would be okay and it was! I was completely surprised and immediately excited at the amount of storage this case offered. 10/10 would recommend if you want the most storage for the money you pay. Buy this case and you won't need a wallet anymore.
0,Very nicely made.. only problem is my credit cards stated falling out after awhile
0,This is my second elago glide case. I had one for my 4s too and it's still going strong!  It's a nice minimalist case that protects from scratches and moderate drops. I've dropped mine from shoulder high onto tile and no damage. There's enough lip on the front to protect the screen if it falls on a flat surface. I really like the matte finish as it slides nicely in and out of pocket but isn't as slippery as some other  cases.  I had the Acase Superleggera Pro Dual Layer case and returned it.  It offered extra protection, but it was bulkier than I wanted and the hard plastic doesn't cover all the way around the bottom, so the silicone inner layer is exposed.  I felt like it was only a matter of time before it stretched out and I didn't like how the silicone caught on my pocket.
0,So far it has been great. Does what it's intended to do. Easy to use phone when it's in case and the headphone port is easily accessible.
0,I love this phone for its design. It works very well and is fast. I think they should improve the cover brings included because it is not of good quality.
0,Very nice fit. Very nice finish.		Not very 'grippy', slightly slick to hold on to.		A bit too chunky for my taste, but likely it gives it better protection due to the rubber corners.
0,love it..
0,Fits perfect!
0,These screen protectors are the best bang for your buck. They fit the screen very well and also super easy to apply. Halo screen protectors are top quality.
0,its amazing so easy to install and looks great  thanks
0,They do their job, no complaints
0,I like these better than the vinyl flexible ones, because they do not scratch as easily, and go on straight with less effort.		My son has managed to crack his screen protector twice, and in both cases the phone's actual screen was protected.  It is much cheaper to buy more glass style protectors than another phone screen, making this a good investment.		This 2 pack includes some cleaning cloths and supplies to apply the screen guard.  It is VITAL that you clean, and clean, and clean again the phone to ensure all residue and dust is removed, or you will get air bubbles.  Once that is done, the protector goes on easy, fits perfectly, and is nearly invisible.		I did not detect any capacitance issues that interfered with the touch function on an iPhone 5s.  I received my product gratis from the vendor for evaluation and review purposes.
0,Love it
0,this  glass protector works great, I love these much more that the plastic style. I watched the short video and that was extremely helpful. It was so easy to get it installed correctly.
0,This case is beyond awesome! Great for a kid that is into Minecraft, its COMPLETELY protects the phone. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it also has a screen protector.		I think as far as cases go, this is one of the best I have ever purchased.
0,I love this big battery. I'm inside all day where I don't have ready access to any signal and I leave everything on - WiFi, bluetooth, GPS and cellular and I get through the whole day and still have more than 60% left. On days when I am out and about, I use the camera freely and never worry about running out of juice. This battery has lasted me nearly 2 1/2 days of heavy use before needing a charge. I use my phone as an eReader and, where the stock batter gives up by noon, this battery just keeps going. I can read my book all day and still not kill the battery. This thing is AWESOME!
0,I was desperately needing a screen protector for my new S4 and I decided to get this one and I'm not disappointed.		The installation is very easy and I didn't get much bubbles, adding to it I didn't know this was a 3pack haha so that was awesome.	I saw other brands that only had 1 for the same price as this. Also I heard that Japanese screen protectors are one of the best quality out there, not sure what they do but its doing the job fine!		I did get the Oleophobic and it seems to be working a bit... It's much better than not having but it still does get smudges and finger prints (I may have extra oily skin) but it does not affect the screen quality at all and some people cant tell I have a protector on.		Would def recommend this product, get this!
0,This bumper protects the sides of the phone and is very light weight. At first I didn't like that one corner is square and the others are round, but it has grown on me an actually helps to hold your phone in one hand. Can't beat the price!
0,LOVE IT GAVE AS A GIFT
0,All together great just make sure I t's unlocked Love mines!!!!
0,The Newisdom Qi wireless receiver works great on my LG G4. I am using it on the T-mobile version H811, LG G4 with the brown leather back. This newisdom receiver card was easy to install and is definitely slim, not causing any issues with reapplying the phones back cover or causing any noticeable bulges. Charging is quick and convenient without the need to plug in. The phone charges at a stable and steady rate without getting hot, just warm just like using the USB charger. The Qi charging distance and placement is very good and rarely requires re-positioning on the wireless charger. I am using it with my "CHOE Circle Qi Wireless Charging Pad" with Smart Lighting Sensor. The wireless receiver works well and is unaffected by the thickness of my Spigen Neo Hybrid protective case.
0,Awesome durable case!
0,The length is very nice to have, very handy when a plug is not nearby. Be aware that if the cable inside is not optimized for charging, nthencharge time is longer.
0,This is my all-time favorite brand and the 3rd one I've bought, just because I wanted different colors, not because they wore out! Affordable and very elegant looking with a good grip, wipes clean with a lightly damp cloth and it makes the phone look much nicer and more expensive! Doesn't add any weight or bulk, which is the reason I get these, plus the secure feeling when the phone is in my hand or I set it down on something, that it's not going to slip, and it doesn't!! Love it and will continue to buy, and I highly recommend this case/cover!!
0,Bought as a gift, no complaints
0,I absolutely love this case. I have not removed it from my phone since I received it last year. I have had no issues with it at all. Hopefully I can find one for the next phone Im getting.
0,thank you very much got what they offered me and what I wanted or sought.	got what I needed, well packed and again.
0,This case is very durable and truly protects the phone. I bought it for my ex and he works for a job where he may drop his phone on numerous occasions each day and so far the phone is still in one piece
0,Good product
0,This is the second case that I have purchased and I can safely say I'm still happy
0,Works
0,I love the compact size and the easy to use samsung operating system.	The only issue I have run into is since January 1, 2014, I can't receive	texts from people with iPhones. Of course Sprint says they have no clue	but its all over the web. I even get the Sprint Spark Signal, which is even	better than the 4g LTE.
0,I wish the clip would be stronger and stay on for longer than 2 months. Otherwise an amazingly awesome cover for my phone.
0,Great Product
0,Great condition and it fit my phone.
0,I used to have a Nexus 5, I like how it is pure google and no bloat ware. However it was lacking mirco sd card slot and my phone is constantly full and have to transfer files every month. So, I decided to get a new phone with a micro sd card slot, and try to find a phone without bloat ware too. I came across to this Moto X Pure, and love how they don't have bloat wares, have a micro sd card slot. I also love the front and back camera with flash on both cameras - this make selfies look better. This phone also comes with voice activation feature that you can preset your phrase like "Find my phone", it is handy when your phone is missing somewhere (kids took it and hid it). One drawback of this phone is it didn't have wireless charging, which is a feature that I miss! Oh, this phone came with a plastic protector case, which I wasn't expecting.		Updated: 1/30/2016: I found out when I record a video, I will get all these hissing noise in the background during replay. I'm annoyed by this because I take videos a lot. I ordered a replacement, but the new phone's hissing problem is way worse than my original one.
0,Works great, charges my Nexus 6p(3450mAh) 4 times from completely dead to 100% and still has juice to spare.

0,tl;dr: It chargers your battery, nice to have a spare battery in you're pocket, its great.		I'll make this quick. I usually carry an extra battery with me at all times, I usually don't put my phone on the charger because I always have a spare battery charging so the minute my phone get's low on battery, I just swap the battery.		Pros:	- It's a battery	- It chargers		Cons:	- It's white and looks a bit cheap.	- Does not come with USB cable, you can purchase one for cheap on here but for the price, you would think it would come with one, eh?	- The charging light (RED) and the fully charged light (Green) bleeds really bad through the charger. Here is an image so you know what I'm talking about. Not a big deal but, makes it feel a bit cheap.	[...]
0,Case is very durable. I've dropped my phone a few times and not even a scratch on the phone. The kickstand is a little flimsy though.

0,Awesome phone. Light on apps, upgraded to newest Android, and is fast with apps, tethering, and everything in between. One of the best unlocked phones out there. Also, audio quality and included JBL earbuds sound great, and the camera and flexibility of this phone is amazing. Would recommend and buy again.
0,Works great with my phone. Long battery life. I got one for my Note 2 also and they both rock. Highly recommend.
0,I love these cases.  I had a green one for my iPhone 6 and then I got a blue one for my iPhone 6 Plus.  It fits perfectly and slimly but still looks like it would provide some protection from a drop and definitely provides scratch protection.  Well worth the money.
0,Huge value for money, ads aren't intrusive at all, but it didn't take much of an impact for the entire screen to shatter
0,My mom is using this and she is thrilled. She loves the convenience of it
0,Overall I like the case (white and gray) and it fits my S5 active perfectly. It's  snug and sturdy. Also makes it easier to hold the phone since the active just seems a bit slippery and difficult  to  hold on its own. The only thing I don't like is the screen protector.  It has dots all over it that makes it seem like I'm  looking through tiny bubble wrap. It's more annoying than harmful and not worth sending  back or taking away anymore stars in my review.  All of the buttons are easily  accessible  and for the first day with it I'm pretty pleased. I'll  update if there are issues.		Update: 10/10/17 Okay, I am woman enough to admit when I make a mistake. This is me admitting my mistake. I looked this thing over before I put it on my phone, but failed to see that it had a very thin protective piece of plastic that was giving it the bubbly appearance. Since my husband was kind enough to point out the fact that I am a ding dong for not seeing this, I have since removed said piece of plastic and am now comfortable giving this case five stars. Guess what?  It's fine and I have been using this case since I bought it!  I have dropped my phone numerous times on the face, on the side, and on the corners and it has never let me down!!! These cases are super! The only change I would make would be the color that I chose, but that was my own doing. I should not have picked a white for myself because the white and grey get dingy when I put it in my blue jeans pocket. Oh well!!! Overall I am very pleased with this purchase. Would definitely recommend to others.
0,These are nice high quality cables, I use them for charging cellphone and tablets and they do provide me with fast charging.
0,Rim 9700 Charging Pod , This product look like simple but very practical items on your desk , I like this device for charging my Mobile & look very stylish ..
0,The case fits well with my iPhone5s.  I had a similar version for my iPhone4, and was content with it... so I went with something I knew would work well.
0,Watch the video before you install these.  It's really very simple. I didn't align the first one perfectly and had to toss it, but the packet comes with three more so it was not a problem.
0,Got it for $15 on sale, so for the price it was a steal.  It works wonderfully.  I don't use it as my main phone, but it's really light and thin, and has a nice feel to it.  If my main phone were to ever die on me I would be happy using this as a backup.
0,I got this for my duty belt. It's very well made. I did however cut off the plastic buckle didn't feel like it was necessary. Fits my note 4 with a otterbox commuter perfectly. You could probably fit the Note with a defender otterbox as well. Very happy with my purchase.
0,I've used Diztronic for my 2 previous phones, so defaulted to them for my Moto X Pure Edition as well.  After an initial bad case (got stretched out somehow?) Diztronic quickly sent me a new one and it fits perfectly.  The buttons are also very easy to press with good tactile response due to some strategic slits in the cover.		Great cover, would buy again.
0,nice
0,It's cute, sleek, stylish!  Love it!
0,Fitbit should have just included something like this with the watch. This makes so much sense, I would have regretted buying my Blaze without this.
0,Almost as cute as the Zebra print. Really liked these as did the teenagers in my life. I would recommend them for giving to that young person in your life.
0,It work good without problems, just it comes bloqued for AT&T so I have to unlock with a company to use it.
0,Excellent
0,It doesn't offer any extreme protection but it sacrificed itself for the sake of my phone and for that, it gets 4 stars. It's thin and lightweight and offered some protection for the front (screen) with the flap when on a table top or tossed in my handbag which is why I bought it. This was actually the second of this style and brand I had bought. Just a few days after getting it, my phone took a tumble onto the hardwood floor. I wasn't expecting there to be any damage but to my surprise, the corner of the case had broken. I was a little peeved but I would much prefer to replace a case than my phone. It's sacrifice has been noted.
0,Convenient and is durable.  Used this when we went on vacation, and never had an issue with the clasp or the zipper.  The pocket is also large enough to fit my Note 5 phone.  Loved it.
0,Is waterproof, and fits an iphone 6s plus with NO CASE, won't fit in with a case, a 6 will fit with a case though. Actually reads finger while in the waterproof case. If your phone has a glass protector on though it won't be read.
0,A simple solution for older cars or rentals that don't have built-in bluetooth.
0,love it, I use it with iPhone 6 + and stong enough to hold my iPhone with case
0,I have been looking for a good portable charger.  I have tried several and I have been disappointed.  This is the first charger that I have been able to charge two phones or devices at once.  It is also the first portable charger that would charge my phone just like it was hooked up to a fast charger.  I am able to charge my phone 4 to 5 times on just one charge.  This charger is worth the money.  Great buy.
0,Love that everyone complains that they cant see my screen. Lol.
0,Great product and arrived time was as vendor promised
0,Didn't care for it
0,its a nice case bigger than I thought. no issue with the charger port only down side. when I opened the bag I saw a black spot on it other than that I love it
0,excellent
0,Protects without compromising the beauty of the phone
0,Find the product to be good	Thank you
0,This is a nice light case for the price. Does not provide complete protection on all sides if that is what you are looking for. I have not had any issues with it though.
0,Love this case. Fast shipping also...thats a +!
0,It works exactly how it's supposed to. Small and easy to attach to your key ring. Perfect for that discreet, extra data you might need.
0,I'm loving this speaker. I was looking for something to use in my bathroom. I'm not putting it in the shower, so I don't know how it holds up to actually being submerged. However, the sound is great and the steam and humidity doesn't seem to be bothering it a bit. I've spent a fair amount of money on different speakers for Ipods/Phones and this one is my favorite so far.
0,It is new and works perfectly internationally: sms, @ and whatsapp
0,Got this case for my fiance after his defender case broke. He loves how compact and less bulky is is compared to his previous case! Also no more dirt underneath the screen!
0,Case is very nice. An attention piece. I haven't used it yet but tried it on the phone. It would be awesome with a black or purple background. Please inform me if you do. Thank you.
0,Works great.  Very happy with the value.
0,This Case is Awesome Simple,plain and nice
0,I used this on my last trip, and being able to exchange the tips was nice. I don't need all the tips, but even so the price is good enough that it isn't an issue. At first I only thought I received one set, but once I opened the box I realized there were two in there. Wondering if that is the case of several people who only claim to have received one set. You get one box but two sets inside.
0,I have used this battery for my traveling to not be with a dead phone because of photos/videos and it has been great.
0,This case is great! Fits perfectly. Super slim but still protects the phone. Definitely recommend!
0,Only problem is you have to take the case off to insert headphones.
0,We live in a high-rise apartment complex (concrete and steel construction).  We have Cingular/AT&T.  Our cell signal strength inside of the apartment is horrible.  Although we typically get 2 bars, the voice quality is bad (e.g., lots of static and the signal cuts in and out so that you only catch a few words at times).  Furthermore, we don't get a strong enough signal in the interior bathroom or the bedroom.  (The signal is at the maximum -- 4 bars -- when we step outside of our building)		We installed the wireless extender inside of the apartment next to a window facing the street.  This position is where we get the strongest signal (3/4 bars).  I placed the antenna horizontally as the instructions suggested.  I placed the wireless extender base unit about 15 feet away from the antenna with the base unit's antenna pointing up as the instructions suggested.  The signal is strong now and we can make calls from the bedroom and the interior bathroom.
0,So far so good. Purchased this for my husband and he pefers this case over the one that he bought at Verizon.
0,Good to leave it in my car.
0,Works well! Minor cons: makes a quiet buzzing noise, small light is almost annoying in the dark, could be a little lighter.
0,So I really enjoyed the note 4 phone case. It is comparable to the otterbox that I usually get but you can add style to the case whenever you want to. I like that feature cause some sometimes i llike to be different with provides one o of the best protection for a phone case. The phone case pretty much does the Job it's suppose to and it does a and I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a phone case in general or a phone case with a little style with it.
0,Like it
0,My kids, family and friends love it, it is so cute. I also use it as a toy at work to distract children when getting shots, its awesome!
0,Works great! I was worried my phone would be too heavy but it holds it up just fine! It looks clean and simple and is pretty sturdy.
0,Imo... Best cases made.
0,thin ... unobtrusive...  protects the glass surface with a little lip that protrudes from the edges of the phone...  it does not get in the way of your thumbs.  When i choose a case...  and i have purchased many ...  about the most important thing to me is the grippyness factor...  i want the back to be grippy enough to my fingers that it does not slip out of my hands or off an angled surface.  i give this a 5 out of grippy on the grippy scale.  if the phone is in your hands without exerting presure on the sides of phone..  you can tilt your hand to a 45 degree before the phone slips out.... not the best... but not bad.
0,The case and cover is holding up pretty good. I have had the occasional drop but mostly on carpet or tiled flooring. No cracks or wearing so far. No problems with either kick stand. Great for face time, Skype or watching movies. I would recommend. If you are hard on items this might not be your option.
0,Crystal clear impact resistant case Flexible and sturdy allowing for extra protection to your phone.		Received this item for free for my unbias review.
0,This car charger is working out well, I like that it has both usb ports available. My wife uses the 1amp port for her iPhone 4S and I use the 2.1amp port for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and Kindle Fire HD.
0,It fits the phone and looks to be doing the job.
0,Good Product
0,Great case. Looks exactly as pictured. It's a little weird to get on at first, but the rubber keeps it super protected while still keeping the case fairly small and thin.
0,Excellent.
0,EXCELLENT
0,A+++++
0,it looks cool
0,Very helpful
0,Works very well for me. I have a life proof case in my iPhone and slides in and out with out any issues
0,Very Good
0,The good....Blazing fast shipping, very high quality plastic that feels good in the hands without being to slick. Just the right amount of lip to protect the screen when phone is face down, and the lip at the top and the bottom seem sized to give just enough protection without being intrusive. If you have man sized hands you'll find that the volume buttons are extremely easy to find (hard to find cases that do this right). This case fits great and looks great.	Luvvitt is a great company with amazing customer service. They have earned my repeat business.
0,After trying many different sleeve based arm bands for my iPhone I give up, then the Amazon gave me a chance to review the Quad Lock and its everything I was looking for. My phone can now simply click into their new sports arm band. If the weather is inclement simply use one of their poncho's and off you go. The sports arm band is very easy to use. Access to your phone either by clicking the phone in and out of the arm band or swiping and using the phone while still on your arm could not be more simple and it is extremely comfortable. The adjustable straps allow for all variations of arm size without compromising any of the access features. I have been using the arm band for weeks now and find myself running/exercising more than normal because I feel I can easily and conveniently use my phone to track my efforts without the stresses of a "sleeve" based arm band. Well done boys, well done.
0,perfect fit with note 3 with protective cover ,still have enough space. quality leather and inside protective cloth. belt holder option to turn.
0,I have bought these months ago and am just now getting around to writing a review. still have all of them in use. was afraid that these were too flimsy and may not hold up but surprisingly they have been durable. highly reccomend
0,Great so far! Fits perfectly!
0,Wick operation. The product was sent as described
0,<div id="video-block-R1LB8B9U6IGZCW" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1vQ2VF0khS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CRYB3nUzS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;I received this item as a free sample. The following review is my honest and unbiased opinion:		This is a fun, novelty watch that lights up with the time (beneath the silicone) when you squeeze it. Squeeze it one more time and you get the date. The watch is playful, fun, accurate, and works best when not in the full sun -- as bright light makes it hard to see the time.		Is this the best, most artsy watch ever made? No way. But I'm saying that it's a very good, 4-star watch for the price ... which is pretty amazing at under ten dollars.		The watch is comfortable, too, which is a plus in an era of so many uncomfortable watches.		Note that there are many "digital numbers" watches like this one out there, all of various prices and styles. Shop around if you're looking for a slightly better/cooler watch for two or three times the price. Such watches are certainly out there, as I show in my video.
0,Loved the case. Unfortunately my G3 has been glitchy with the screen going out,  apparently a big problem for the g3.  I had to buy a new phone.  Got a great month use out of it though.
0,I got this for the T-mobile LG G2 and it fit perfectly. I love the feel and look of the case. I would change a few things. The LG G2 have the power and volume button next to each other on the center back of the phone. The power button is in the middle of the volume buttons and the rubber cover of the case are all the same height. I find myself hitting the wrong button a lot. The case has a kickstand that makes it easy to prop the phone up if you want to watch something. The kickstand opens up the wrong way. It should be flipped. I have apps that will not allow me to have the landscape mode in the position the kickstand sits.
0,This MHL adapter works as well as I would expect with my SGH-T989. My only complaint about it is that it feels somewhat flimsy; I just need to make sure it's packed in a place in my travel bag that it won't be crushed.		Worth noting - HDMI output slows my T989 substantially; at least it did on 4.0.4. It may be faster now with 4.1.2, but the phone is by no means unusable while hooked up.
0,Very nice case - good quality and fits about perfect.
0,I love this case! The colors are vivid and it fits perfectly! Arrived on time. Will order from here again.
0,Great case. Not much more to say.
0,Good product. The clear is nice to just have to protect your phone or to make your own cute cases :)
0,Installation was easy, but initially, it looked like the top edge of the screen protector was not adhering well to the phone even after I pushed it down with the included card.  After an hour or so, all the edges were flush, and the phone looks great.  The only compaint I have is the screen protector does not go to the edge of the screen, there is ~2mm on all sides.
0,Amazing battery for USB charged or powered devices. It won't power my M4500 Dell Precision laptop though even when switching from 9V to 12V. Only the Energizer XP18000 will do that.		For all other purposes this battery has been great and in my limited, non-professional testing was able to charge both my iPhone and my tablet from less than 10% battery to 100% each but only drained the battery to 83%. Both devices were charged very quickly at the same time.		The unit is very small for what you get, seems very well made and I like the LCD screen with the % of battery display.
0,Very nice, the case looks great, love the finish on the back of the case. Looks expensive, good quality.
0,Good power. Able to charge 6 tablets at once. Had mine fake about 3 weeks in, but got a replacement in 2 business days and free shipping back in for broken item.
0,It appears to be well made and can accommodate 2 devices simultaneously.  Charging time is faster than a standard A/C plug USB configuration
0,When it first arrived I was extremely happy to see it arrived nicely packed in bubble wrap and included was a tampered glass screen protector which is a nice surprise. The case itself looks stylish and feels comfortable to hold. The button cut outs are perfect and doesn't require a lot of effort when trying to push the case does add a little bulk but nothing like an outta box case does. It's feels premium while holding and not slippery at all. The corner bumpers do pertrude a little but that's so it handles any drops that may accure. The carbon fiber look really adds style to this case, I would Definitely recommend to any wanting protection and style for a reasonable price.
0,Very fitting with my phone.	I love it!
0,Use this for everything!!! Love it!
0,This is a nice little handy device and extremely useful for videographers or video-bloggers. It can be attached to any window, glass or smooth surface. The suction is very powerful. I use it with my light Sony camcorder, but it can easily hold my heavier DSLR camera.
0,I have had this same Spigen thin fit case for my Google Nexus 5x, galaxy note 4, galaxy note 3, and now my Google Nexus 6P and I have to say it is straight FuKING awesome!!! It is the nicest looking design yet and it adds the PERFECT amount of texture. I have the rugged Spigen as well and that too is great just as the then fit however my personal preference is the thin fit even tho it has less drop protection. I would however not hesitate to buy a second if needed and I would still recommend this case to everyone!!
0,good
0,great!

0,Comments about "...lag." are misleading.  This phone is fantastic for someone who replaced a flip phone.  This is my first smartphone and it is a wonder, this piece of technology known as the LG G3.  I worried about the lag that others cautioned about.  I still purchased the phone because it was only a penny through Verizon.  I remember learning of this phone when it was first released.  It was a phenomenal phone then, and still is.		Context is important.  What are you comparing this phone to?  What are you trying to replace?  If you want a phone with 6G of RAM, you'll just have to wait a few years.  This is a great device.  It is all new to me.  Apps, widgets, all of these possibilities of screen design.  The photographs are great.  Honestly, if you want perfection with photography, buy an expensive Nikon camera.  For taking photos of gatherings, parties, sending photos over text message, this camera is far more than you'll need.  My only wish is that Hipstamatic would work with the Android ecosystem.		Final words.....Be wary of the naysayers.  Remember, context is critical.  You will be pleased with this phone.
0,One of the best quality wallet cases I have owned.	- made of real leather and has an elegant look	- I can put a few credit cards and cash in there. It is little bit hard to close due to that. Most of the time I just keep one credit card and an ID in there so it doesn't not pose a problem	- case seems durable and I had it for over 3 weeks and still don't see much wear.	- it does protect our phone some if it is dropped but not as good as other hard cases	Overall: I very recommend it for looks and functionality! I wish there was more colorful options for it with designs	Snugg kindly provided me with a free sample of this product for unbiased testing and reviewing purposes.
0,Excellent case and definitely worth the cost.
0,The case fits perfectly and is very sturdy.
0,It does what it says it does.
0,Only I haven't used it yet. Because it's a hard back cover only & I need to keep using the leather one that covers my whole phone while working, But i will use it someday SOON! But very pretty design.
0,GREAT,JUST WHAT I WANTED THX
0,It works it should. It will give me a full charge, and for the price I paid I cannot complain at all.  I keep it in my car and use it as a backup.  No problem.  The last charging light does not always light up, but he full charge light does, so IDK.  It is still awesome, and many of my friends have purchased after seeing mine.
0,This bumper is still going strong and the price was cheap.  It has the full buttons and hasn't fallen apart like so many others I have had.
0,This fits the iPhone 5S perfectly. I recommend you watch a YouTube video or go on iFixIt so you can familiarize yourself with the process if you haven't done this before. Changing the glass can be tricky, but if you're patient and careful, it can be done and you don't have to be an expert.		The glass feels like the OEM glass. The quality is pretty good. I really didn't notice a difference in the look or feel of the screen after changing it. Using the right amount of UV glue is tricky. It takes some practice. I used a bit more than what it says in the instruction videos because I kept getting a lot of bubbles.		The tools that come with this kit are very helpful and they're all I used to change the glass. I didn't need anything extra. The screwdrivers are a bit cheap and hard to grip, but they still work. That's probably the worst part of this kit.		All in all, I'm happy with this purchase. It got the job done and saved me a lot of money.
0,Really good case and sender. Great price and durable.
0,Fits my gear vr and headphones and controller fine. Can't figure out the spacer thou. Nice net pocket for misc cables.
0,I love this little charger!!  With technology becoming more and more an essential bare necessity in our lives, the need for chargers is only increasing.  Everytime I turn around, there's another device that's battery has died on me and requires me to decide between which device I need the most.  I've had other USB chargers that required not only a power source, but also access to my computer as well.  Which isn't really handy for everyday use.		With the RiF6 fast charger, all you need is a power source and you can instantly charge up to four devices at once!  So no more deciding which device shall be granted the POWER of charging....  I also LOVE that it has these little bands you can use to switch the look out of your charger!  I instantly swapped the orange one that comes on it with the blue one!!!		*  Sample Provided for Testing & Review
0,Works perfectly!  Very good item-- I especially the shape because it stands taller than the other plugs, making it easier to identity.
0,ok
0,is the best mount holder you can buy for that much of money. I had it for over than 3 months with no problems. I used it for iphone 5s and now I'm using it for Samsung S 5. it's great and I love it especially has 2 USB chargers plug.
0,what she asked for
0,Super handy and works great. Magnet is plenty strong and nice to have the flexibility of removing the phone.
0,I bought these cases because I LOVE bling! I was so excited when I saw these listed and they have overly met my expectations!!! They are sooooooo cute! I had expected the glitter to fall all over the place, much like the other bling and studded cases I use to buy for my BB Torch. But, Not a chance! The glitter on these cases aren't going anywhere, anytime soon! The cases are also nice and sturdy, with a clear film lining on the inside of the case where the phone and case meets (maybe to avoid friction, but I don't know, i didn't remove it). My friend has the 4s and i think the quality on these cases are much better than the ones she has, because hers looks like it has glitter paper, whereas you can feel the actual glitter texture on these cases! The sides of the cases are clear, which still allows the beauty of my white iPhone to be seen! I also LOVE these colors, they are bright and vibrant; it also came with a screen protector, which i installed myself; it also came with four matching stylus and even though i don't need to use it, I'm considering it because they are so cute and it matches the cases perfectly! But I ended up giving one of them away to my mother-in-law to use with her touch screen phone and she loves it! Overall, I LOVE this package and i would highly recommend!
0,It doesn't fast charge, but it does charge everything under the sun at normal speed. Very good product.
0,Nice solution to a problem of getting my radar detector to lay flat on my dashboard.  Rated this as 4 stars as I've found the top of the pad to be tackier than the bottom.  As a result, when I remove the radar detector the pad pulls up from the dash requiring that I more or less peel the detector from the pad.  The tackiness of the top could be a little less tacky to allow the detector to be removed easier.
0,Excellent
0,Three ports but they are not identical... notice that the three ports are for different devices and you'll appreciate this charger. I use mine for my Apple iPhone 5s so I put tape over the two (for now) unused ports so I would not make a mistake. If you own  a smart phone, a tablet, and some other device, you will appreciate this multi-function charger. I like it!
0,I like the clear case.  It fit the phone perfectly and was easy to put on. Also, it arrived when promised.
0,Great durable product that's a perfect fit for the T-Mobile Samsung S4.
0,I love the screen protector I received a a product test. It fits great on my phone. If you want the extra protection you should get this to.	I received this free to test the product out
0,Full disclosure: I got this product at a reduced price. Okay, now that's out of the way, on to the product review		Pros:	1. It's lightweight and easy to store. The solar panel folds up and has a magnetic flap thing that folds over the panels to keep it together. As far as I can tell, the magnetic flap is strong enough to keep everything folded up correctly.	2. The outside of the solar charger is made up of solid fabric-type stuff (not sure what it is, actually). This gives it a durable fell that I think will, over time, keep the charger from being hurt	3. Three panels on the charger make for more wattage during charging. There are two usb ports on this, which means you could (in theory) charge two devices at the same time. I've sucessfully charged my larger phone (Galaxy Note 5) but haven't tried anything beyond that. I reckon it's got enough juice to slowly charge an ipad if you needed to, but that charging would go a bit slower.	5. There is a handy zip-up pouch for cords. Since the charger comes with one included usb cord (mirco usb on one end) that leaves plenty of room for other charging cables (lightning, micro usb, usb type c, etc).	6. The claimed 24% efficiency is pretty solid for a usb charger and this price. Maybe in another 30 years we will have solar panels at least 50% efficient.		Cons:	1. There is only one single led light that shows charging. Beyond that, the interface for charging devices is a no-go. While you don't need something beyond a single bulb, I assume more info would be nice (how much juice is getting to your device, for example, would be nice info to have).
0,Fits my iPhone 6s very well, with a screen saver - it provides good protection.
0,This case works very well with the HD7. It has the cut out for the stand which works great! I doesn't add unnecessary bulk and it looks cool with the brushed polycarbonate back. Very good case!
0,PRETTY GOOD CASE I HAVE SEEN BETTER BUT THIS ONE IS GOOD. I REALLY LIKE THE BACK AND THE FEEL OF THE CASE. SEEMS THAT IT IS GOING TO HOLD UP PRETTY WELL AND THAT IT WILL GIVE DECENT PROTECTON FOR MY PHONE I THINK IT COULD BE BETTER BUT ITS STILL PRETTY GOOD.		RECIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY REVIEW.
0,Cute durable protective cover for my phone.
0,Best thing about this is it is sticky and won't slide around
0,My niece and nephew recently saved up their money and purchase their first Ipods. I decided to get them the cases. I let them pick out what they wanted as long as it offered some protection. This Ipod 5 case from Bentoben is nice. It has a shockproof bumper along the edges and the back. A decorative thin outer shell goes on the outside. My niece loves the wavy design with the pink. The cutouts all line up so no problems reaching any buttons. It looks like this will give the perfect protection without being bulky and still staying Cool looking.

0,This length of cord allows placement of a phone while charging in so many different locations. One in the house and one in the car allows me to remain in touch no matter what the battery condition is.
0,Works for me!
0,It broke after 5-6 months which was reasonable for a after market product. But when it did work, it worked very well.
0,Haven't had the separation issue yet, but if I do, I'll edit this review straight away.		It's a good looking bumper, got mine in red.		Coming from a different phone with an otter box, it feels a bit naked...		I'm still terrified to drop the phone, but every review I've read on these bumpers say that they are good cases for protection as well...
0,Works great!
0,It is exactly what I wanted.  I have one, but like to have an extra as a backup.
0,I am very pleased with this stand.	1) Looks like an Apple product. Very sleek & pretty.	2) I have a case on my iPhone 6 (4.7) & it fits great. It even works with my iPad mini 3.	3) The base is long enough & sturdy so it shouldn't tip. I haven't had any problem with that while charging both devices.	4)  The watch adapter fits fine & does charge.	I only have one concern & suggestion.		1) I noticed that the watch must be aligned a certain way otherwise it won't charge. In all fairness to the product, it could be that I have a milanese (after market) band that is a little heavy. Once I figured that out. It was all good. It could possibly be my fault.	2) I wish it was iPhone charger as well. Then it would be perfect. When I unplug the iPhone i have to use both hands. One to hold the Phone & the other, the cable. Thats why I gave it four stars because of the removal process.  I know its not a charger but it can be a nuisance when removing it. Other then that, I highly recommend it. I'm also very pleased with this seller. I will be reviewing an Apple watch rubber TPU case from this seller.
0,It fits perfect and it's very well made.  I would order this again because it's every bit as good as an otter box
0,This is a must have I will encourage any one to get it on less you can afford a new phone avery time you drop it
0,Nice design with minimum protection and minimum bulk.
0,Update:	I just received the replacement from Otterbox and it fits perfectly.  My touchscreen works as expected again. Thanks Otterbox!!!!!!!!  I almost lost faith in you.		Original review:	My spouse just purchased this Otterbox Defender case from Walmart for me.  I have a 5S Otterbox Defender that I love and we hoped this 5C one would be the same. Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations.		Pros: the green color is beautiful	-the case is simple to put on	-after 4 days the case has not stretched (okay, this doesn't count because I haven't been taking it off/on and it's only been 4 days)	-the case is hard and yes it'll prevent the phone from being damaged from drops		Cons:	-my 5S case (not this one) has a rubber shell that is higher than the inside hard case, but my 5C (this case) inner hard shell just goes over the top of the outer shell by millimeters right near the camera, resulting in the inside hard case getting dinged right there	-and my biggest pet peeve: this may not bother some, but for me, it's a big deal.  What's the point of having a protective screen if it makes the touch screen annoying harder to use? Please see the picture especially where the camera is.  That's not a line, that's a shadow because the screen protector is not flush with the screen of my 5C. As a result, I have to tap harder (or do multiple taps) to get any response from my 5C.  It's like have one of those terrible dud stylus that doesn't cause hardly any reaction whatsoever. Just fracking annoying.		I'm giving Otterbox 2 stars instead of 1 though, because their customer service is great.  I called them today and inquired about this issue (before I saw these horrific reviews on Amazon). The customer service person was great, but said that sometimes it takes 3-4 days for the screen to 'break in'.  I wasn't convinced (because my 5S case never had this issue) but willing to allow Otterbox to correct this mistake. They were going to send me an inner replacement case. Unfortunately, they didn't have any pieces or the green color. Now they're sending me a new full black casing with hopes it'll address this issue.  I'll update my review once the new case gets here.
0,I was worried that this protector would make the phone too large for my jean pockets.  Not true.  The added size makes holding the phone easier than without a protector. I am less likely to drop the phone and less likely to touch the edge of the touch screen by accident. It makes using the GX3 easier.  One note: it does not give screen protection. You have to buy separate screen protectors.
0,Great
0,Great product for the price! This protector leaves a small gap of screen unprotected with my slim case, but not enough to bother me.
0,Both my husband and I just upgraded our phones and we had the choice of screen protectors to use and we went with this one. Its super easy to apply, just use the little napkin they provide to take any lint off and clean the screen.  Next you take the film off that has the sticker labeled 1. Place it down on the phone and use the small card provided to take any bubbles off. Pull the top film off and you are done. Love love LOVE it. Provided at a discount in exchange of an honest review.
0,This is a pretty straightforward product but Arcadia does it well. For the price of one, this bundle gives you three! (so feel free to share with friends, I did)		Installation is easy with the tabs that they have on both ends of the screen. Just make sure to eliminate all dust particles before installation. So far I have yet to notice fingerprint stains as the coating seems to make the screen protector quite resistant to oil. The protector also does not take away from the clarity of the screen as things look as sharp as ever.	a	This is a reliable product and if you need protection, step right up.
0,great item
0,I realy like the versitility of this cover and the colors. also I like the added protection It gives my phone
0,Good slim case. I had this a couple of week now and haven't noticed any changes in its appearance. I got the grey color and there is no signs of wear or color fade.
0,One of the best phone cases I've ever used. Every phone I purchase in the future I will be checking to see if they have a case for it.
0,Been using these for a couple of years on multiple devices and they are great. I recommend these to family and friends I have never had an issue with them

0,Jackery makes a very good product.  I purchased the Jackery Giant+ as a gift.  It is built nicely with an aluminum case, but it is a bit slippery.  The LED flashlight feature is awesome.  It can last 800 hours, and it is a lot stronger brighter light than the lower model Jackery portable batteries with a flashlight.  The Jackery Giant+ measures approximately 4.3" x 3.1" x 0.8".  It weighs about 10.4 oz.  It takes 10 hours to fully charge, but t has a 6 month standby time which is excellent. You can charge two devices via USB connection at the same time (one at 1A and the other at 2.1A).  Great to have the back-up power and not have to worry about not having re-charged it after a month or two in your bag or pack.  I definitely recommend this product.  It is great for emergencies at anytime especially those unexpected power failures and you need power to re-charge your phone or pad to do work, play games, make calls or send email, and also if you need light that stays on for a long time.  It does not have a pass-through, so it will not charge itself if you are plugged into it using it to charge a device or two.  It can charge an iPhone 6 about 4 1/2 times, so you don't need to keep recharging it right away if you don't want until it gets very low.  There is an app you can download to help identify and manage the remaining power levels.  If you do not need the 12,000mAh from the Jackery Giant+ and you want one slightly smaller and lighter at 10,200mAh, you can buy the Jackery Fit which also has an LED flashlight (though less powerful and less brighter) and also can charge 2 devices via USB.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Jackery-Fit-Portable-Battery-Charger-10200mAh-External-Battery-Pack-Power-Bank-Portable-Charger-for-Apple-iPhone-6s-6s-Plus-6-Plus-5-iPad-Air-iPad-Mini-Samsung-Galaxy-S6-and-S5-Orange/dp/B00F00B9A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Jackery Fit Portable Battery Charger 10200mAh - External Battery Pack, Power Bank, & Portable Charger for Apple iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, 6 Plus, 5, iPad Air, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S6, and S5 (Orange)</a>		I recommend the Jackery Giant+ since the cost and the physical size difference is both marginal.  The more power an the stronger flashlight is a plus.
0,I have used the Seidio battery before on my previous HTC Incredible.  Just got the HTC Thunderbolt and decided to buy this.  Installed it in the phone and let it charge, with the phone off, overnight.  Turned it on 24 hours ago and have left it on.  Battery is still reading 7/8 full.  The replacement back that comes with it fits well.  So far, so good.  My previous battery worked like a champ for 2 years until I replaced the phone.
0,Very light, thin and strong. High quality product!
0,Everything included for an easy installment.	Tools were quality and durable.	Now I have a working phone again
0,This protects phone from drops. Very well made but adds a lot of bulk to the phone.
0,Have not had a chance to use it because it is winter here but it is well made
0,Good cases for the new (as I write) S5 are hard to find and run a premium. This one is so inexpensive my hopes were low. It is low profile, unlike the bulky Otterbox cases I've used before, plus is appears to have no parts will stretch or fatigue as the OB cases can. The mounting is odd in that you slide the S5 its full length both into and out off the belt holster. It has a clever kickstand which is of limited value, but works as well as any I've seen for a phone this size. It should be thin enough to allow for Qi charging, but I can't test that until Samsung releases the Qi charging back for the S5. The only real drawbacks I can see are 1) that the phone's screen is forced across felt whenever it is taken in or out of the case which could lead to scratches if sand, etc was deposited on the felt and 2) the mounting action would peel off most screen protectors every time the phone was put in or out of the holster. But I can't confirm that either of these is a real problem since the S5 screen protectors are on back order along with the Qi parts. If any vendor wants to send me a screen protector, I'll see if it comes off or not.
0,Love this once. Covers all the portions of the phone and is a TPU case.
0,Worked great when I used them years ago
0,Excellent
0,Perfect for office day to use.  Give and retains slim attractiveness  of GS5...
0,I like this free case its bright and cheery colors just burst with joy. Its durable and easy to carry, it protects my device while looking fashionable and uplifting.
0,These are truly great cables, and I love my 10 foot long version (and the nylon wrapping makes them so much easier to travel with, etc.)		However after more than a year of repeated daily use, mine finally started giving me problems (and wouldnt work with my iPad any longer for some reason)... I wasn't sure what to do, except maybe buy a new cable.....		but instead, I decided to contact Anker customer service (via Amazon) and they IMMEDIATELY agreed to send me a new replacement cable with no fuss, and no jumping through hoops....after describing my problem, and they offered to send me a BRAND NEW ONE (all I had to do was email a photo of the cable, since I had cut off the little white tag with the serial number when I first got it).		Anker really stands behind their products, and they have GREAT customer service....VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH THE PRODUCT AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM (especially Sylvia, who was so polite and helpful!)
0,Works better than expected. I did the tissue test and it worked. I wouldn't take the chance by completely submersing my phone but for light splash should work well.
0,Ordered twice for the price.	Works great.
0,When I bought this Phone, it came with JellyBean software, it was terrible phone. This phone was plagued with bad GPS reception and Ram management was very poor, but with the KitKat update, things has changed. There are still minor bugs that people has have encountered. I have yet to encounter any single bug on KitKat update. Stylus and battery life is main selling point of this phone. I get approx 20-24 hours of battery life with moderate use. Moderate use includes few calls, a lot of snapchatting and texting, navigation and little gaming. This phone is a powerhouse. There is more room for improvement in terms of performance and camera quality, if At&t and Samsung can work fast and together.		Negative:	Too much at&t and samsung bloatware.	Plastic body.
0,seems oem to me!	looks and feels like the original.
0,Looks good
0,Prior to owning this portable battery source, I had a smaller one with about 1/2 the mAh. At first, I loved it, the solar charged the battery in about a day, but then the solar charge stopped working, necessitating a new unit.  I found this one, with it's large 15,000 mAh battery. Obviously with a bigger battery, I will have a bigger bodied unit and a bigger solar panel.  One thing I really like about the larger battery is that I can use it to charge 2 devices at the same time, as it has 2 output ports. Although I haven't had to use the flashlight on the back, I have played with it and it is very bright. I believe it's 9 LED's (my old one was only 1 LED).  I will at times go camping or hiking and will be away from electricity for a few days, so i wanted something that I could use to charge my phone while I'm away.  I've got regular batteries for backup, but once they are dead, they are just extra weight. Thats what I really like about the solar charger.  I clip it to my backpack, and go on my way. If I'm inside, I'll sit near a window and even indirect light will charge it, although a little slower.  Very happy with my purchase.  I did receive this at a slight discount for my honest and unbiased review, and I would have paid full price for it without question.

0,the best for carrying on you belt
0,This phone is great at doing what phones should do best -- calling and receiving calls.  I purchased a Motorola F3 for a great price just before a trip to Nicaragua in 2009.  I purchased a SIM card at the airport in Managua, loaded minutes onto the phone, and didn't have any problems.  It was much cheaper than adding international service through my carrier in the US.  The battery life on this phone is excellent.  I'm thinking about upgrading phones to one that has better texting capabilities and one that isn't quite so old.  Overall, this is a great, inexpensive phone.  It worked great for me in high humidity and it's very slim, so it's great if you plan to keep it in your pocket while you travel.		I would recommend comparing this to newer quad-band phones since they will probably fall within the same price range.
0,So far so good!  No difficulty getting it to fast charge.  The notification light is easy to see nut not too bright for sleep. I had a Samsung fast charger that both died and was difficult to get charging right. This was half the price and is easier to operate and the light is not as intrusive
0,So far so good. Does not take long to charge this up again. works great...awesome company to work with
0,Love this thin, durable case. I used this for about 1 year before having to get another. I haven't found a better belt holster out there.
0,this is the best charger cable I've seen! it is built very sturdy and it has a lifetime guarantee! and I can actually use my galaxy s5 while its charging because I have plenty of cable to move around. I've had this cable for about 2 weeks and it is as good if not better than the one that came with the phone. it is exactly what the seller says it is. thank you very much AmaMax!
0,great product very satisfied

0,Nice case. Went on easily and fits perfectly!
0,This OEM wireless charge pad is great!  I really enjoy not having to plug it in just lay it on there, the blue light comes on and stays on while it is charging.  I charge it while I sleep and have had no issues, just make sure you buy only OEM equipment, it costs a little more but is well worth it.
0,Very cool looking case, very sturdy
0,Protects great. Minus a star because my design has worn off the back in less than a year.
0,Nice 3d VR headset! First time I tried one so I can't compare it other headset. I played with it for sometimes with iPhone 5s and here what I found:	Pros:	- Nice comfrotable straps around your head that can be adjusted and fit my head very well	- magnetic door with padding to push your phone gently when closing door.	- Good plastic materials yet still not heavy on your head.	- nice foam around eyes> I watched movie for half hour with no issue or problem		Things to know:	- You can search the movies/videos source either by Youtube is available for panorama videos / movies or Search 3D SBS Movies / Videos  Google / Bing / Yahoo or also youtube	- There are plenty of other VR apps in the App store that you can use with it.	- make sure your phone size fit the recommended size.	- Better to use headphones to get the best audio with your 3d video. Wired/wireless both work fine.	- find better high quality videos; I noticed that even you still see good 3d effect but the image quality will be slightly less or at least that what I found using iPhone 5s.	I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. If you have any question please leave it in comment section and I will try my best to answer it. Thanks
0,[...]	^ This is my video review for the Elago S4 Glide iPhone 4/4S case. I purchased this case over two years ago now, and i am very happy i did. If you want protection, but do not want a bulky case, then this is the case for you! It is slick, slim, and sturdy. I can easily see getting at Least another year out of it!	I go more in depth in the video, please don't hesitate to watch it!	[...]
0,Bought this case before and it has withstood the test of time.  Have a second Icon and would hight recommend, it does take a beating.
0,Just what I was looking for.
0,works good, fits great, makes holding the tab easier.
0,The life proof case was nice but considering it broke with in not even having it for 6 months I was a little disappointed
0,Its good
0,Got the 2 pack as described.  Look identical to the original cord and even has the SAMSUNG logo on the cable ends.  Great value!
0,This is the fourth Caseology case I have bought. This specific one was for my brother for his new phone. He loves it. The blue is his favorite color and the white matches his phone perfectly. It is slim and does not take up too much room but it also has texture so it does not slip from your hands. We have both had Caseology cases and even though we are both prone to dropping/throwing our phones we have yet to have a broken phone with these on. Everything about them is great. I recommend them to everyone I know.

0,Nice case. Serves its purpose. Most of all it allows me to show the beauty of my Iphone6 Plus. Would buy again.
0,I love this thing it works as described I use it with a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and an Otter case and it works perfectly and there's room for a larger case if I had one. Ended up ordering four more to give as gifts

0,When buying a case for a kids phone you want something that is inexpensive but yet will keep the phone safe and intact. This case does  that and does it for a fraction of the cost of the more popular cases. With a wide variety of colors, she could get what she wanted and I could pay something that didn't break the bank.
0,I recently got a ISELECTOR power strip and, overall, I am pretty happy with it. When I saw this 10 port USB charging doc with two AC outlets I was pretty excited. I already  have a 5 port USB charging hub but these days that just isn't enough. So I jumped at the chance to give this one a try.		When it arrived I was surprised at how big it is. I know it shows a row of 10 ports aligned vertically in the photos. But that didn't really prepare me for the size which is quite large. Other than the ports there are two standard grounded three prong AC outlets and a large cylindrical power button with a very firm action and a small LED that indicates when the power is turned on.		At first I wasn't sure what the big row of fins along the top were. It looks like a heatsink but the fins are plastic so obviously its not going to be for cooling. It wasn't obvious to me at first that these were the organizing slots in the description. So the fins are actually used as a storage rack. They are great for cell phones and power banks which are usually thin rectangular shapes. They aren't tall enough for large 10 inch tablets but are fine for the smaller 6 or 7 inch ones.		The 10 port USB charger works very well with one niggle. There is a cooling fan inside the 10 port USB charger and our one is quite loud. Its a small fan, probably about 2 inches in diameter and, as a result, spins very quickly making an audible whine that can be heard from several feet away. Because of this noise we ended up putting the charger into our walk-in book closet where it cannot be heard when the door is closed.		Each individual port will output 2.4 amps and I can charge all our household phones, tablets and multiple Bluetooth speakers and headphones while running two USB accent lights from it which look great illuminating the model yacht we have displayed in the living room.		The two AC outlets sit on top and I use one to charge my notebook PC and the other for my receiver. They are on a protected circuit that can dissipate 1700 joules or 1800 amp energy spikes which is better than most of the powerstrips we have around the house.		Another cool thing is that it can be plugged into  110v  120v outlets. My husband is British and the UK along with quite a few other countries use a 120v supply. So if you travel you can use this one large charger in place of several small low power ones. And you only need an adapter for the plug; it already comes with two standard US outlets to power your own devices that run on 110v US power.		Conclusion		If you have many USB devices like we do and want to be able to charge them all at once, in one location this is really nice. Each USB outlet gives up to 2.4 amps which is towards the higher end while being safely within the charging limit of most consumer electronic products. It works with 110v  120v which means you can use it safely on foreign trips, which is especially handy with the two standard US power outlets on top. And the surge protector means that you have some peace of mind when traveling that minor power fluctuations shouldnt affect your equipment. It doesnt come with the 10 USB cables you will need to charge 10 items simultaneously. But just about every device that charges via USB comes with one anyway. And most of us have spares lying around.		It's a shame that the cooling fan is audible. Because if it were quieter it would be fantastic and have gotten 5 stars. It is a dedicated charging station. The USB charging isn't an afterthought and despite being fairly large in size is surprisingly lightweight.		Disclaimer: I received this charger in exchange for an honest and fair review.  The opinions expressed are my own.
0,A great sim card for those who need a 3 in 1 sim (Full size sim + Micro sim + Nano sim). One received, I chatted with a H2O rep and got it successfully switched out and activated.		Overall: A painless activation and would defiantly recommend!
0,Great product very happy with.

0,Ok
0,I am very impressed with anker. I purchased this in january and it worked perfectly until about a month ago when it stopped charging. I emailed them and after asking me to perform a few simple troubleshooting tasks, they recognized the device was indeed broken. They honored the 18 month warranty and sent me a new one right away - It arrived a little over 24 hours later! While i do have some concerns that the battery may stop working again after a few months, i feel confident with ankers service that they will fix the issue if something does happen. I have been happy with my other anker products so i am hopeful that this was a one time fluke. They also didn't make me send the broken one back to them which i appreciated not having to go to the trouble to do.
0,Came as stated had $0.00 to install sims, transfer phone book and link to account
0,It fits my LG840G very nicely. Like the purple color, makes it look stylish and fresh. Ordered several colors so I can change them out and because it took almost a year to find the ones that fit the LG840G cell phone. Thank you Amazon.
0,Perfect fit
0,I'm amazed with how well this product works. I charge it nightly while I charge my phone and can get between 2 and 3 complete-from-empty charges from it per day. This is super handy with those long 'Pokemon Go' days. The solar ability is very acceptable. While at work I leave it on the dashboard of my car and it is fully pumped and ready to go when I am ready to head from work to wherever I'm going next. No more worrying or wondering if my phone has enough power for the rest of the day. No more entering power saver mode to stretch my phone out. It comes with a small charging cable for Android phones and it all makes for a fantastic mobile power station.
0,Good product!
0,I bought this to charge my iPhone 6 Plus. The cheap charger I had previously barely maintained a charge, much less charged it. This one charges just as well as a wall charger (more or less, didn't do a study!). Also charges better than the built-in USB in my Toyota. I like it so much, I also bought a 4 port version for the family mini-van.
0,Pros	It will protect your Samsung Galaxy Note 4 verry well.	It is better quality than an Otterbox in my opinion.	It looks great and isn't to bulky.		Cons	It makes the figure print reader hard to use as the lip of the case makes it hard to slide you finger down the screen and get a perfect finger reading.	It makes the hart rate sensor imposible to use! The case just simply covers up the sensor to much that you can't place your figure on the sensor for it to get a reading.	The color or white cases will absorb it dies in colors from your pants and clothes. So it will look discolored and dirty after just a couple weeks.		I decided to send my baxk as it isn't worth the price for having a case that won't let me use the extra sensors. They are a reason I upgraded to the Note 4 from my Note 3. But if you don't mind not using the sensors much then this case if for you!
0,This thing is so useful i actually got 2. All smartphones (specially android devices) drain battery like there's no tommorow. This thing will let you last one full day(My 1 full day is About 20 hours of continuous non stop heavy usage not the lame ass 8 hours some blogs refer to)		Highly recommended for heavy smartphone users.
0,nice color and look great
0,This protector provides a good layer of protection and a very close fit to the profile of the Galaxy Nexus.  However, this style is extremely sensitive to dust during application.  If the underside attracts any small particles during the application process, it is effectively ruined, as its adhesive makes it impossible to clean off afterwards.  I had to discard one of the 3 protectors because I had this problem the first time I tried to apply it.  The best method for application is to use a large microfiber cleaning cloth (not the supplied one, it is way too small) to thoroughly clean the screen first---it must be pristine!  Then you remove the backing protector slowly and progressively while pressing the screen protector into place.  Do not replace the backing protector film all at once and then try to put it in place, it will almost certainly attract dust that way.  Also do not attempt to remove and reapply the screen protector once it has been put into position, because that will also attract dust.  So the bottom line is that this is a great screen protector if you can take the necessary care during the application process and have a relatively dust-free environment to do so.  And the fact that it comes in a 3-pack still makes it cost-effective even if you waste one (like I did) trying to get the application just right.	P.S.  I have the GSM version of the Galaxy Nexus and these screen protectors work just as well on that model as on the CDMA (Sprint or Verizon) one.

0,I have always wanted a holder that would fit my iPad or tablet on the wall.  This ZAZZ holder is worth waiting for.  It fits between 8.9" to 10.4" tablets and only weighs 5.9 ounces.		As we all know, they keep changes the sizes of iPads and other tablets.  Being adjustable is a must - and this is.  I was able to use it with different generations of iPads and they were securely held.  It is important to follow the instructions for affixing the wall mount on the wall.  The bracket fits onto the mount and can be turned to either landscape or portrait view.		I have it mounted near my desk and can simply turn to it, touch the screen, and go to apps.  One of my apps is a calculator - so I can punch in the numbers onto the touch screen and get the answer I am looking for.  Being on the wall leaves my desk space clear.  As with all tablets, you will need to recharge it - so think about that with your planning as well.		Overall, a great accessory to use for anyone who desires to mount their tablet on the wall!
0,nice
0,I received this item in order to test it and write an honest review.  This product worked fine for me, and it did charge all devices within a good amount of time.  The charger did become warm but I kind of expected that while it's charging multiple gadgets at the same time.	I will post a follow-up if/when this charger stops working, but so far, I have used it about 9 times with no issues.  Meanwhile, I love the fact that it can charge up to 5 devices at once....this really decreases the number of cables which would otherwise be going in every direction! :)
0,Purchased as a gift which was well received. Quality product which offers plenty of protection in the event of a disaster. I have used Speck products for years and entrust my phone to the integrity of this company.
0,I just ordered my third one of these.  The first one quickly broke - the prongs stopped folding down properly.  The company sent me a free replacement.  The replacement is still working great and I ordered a third as a preset.		As others have noted in reviews, the prongs sometimes quit working and, if that happens, you lose the function of being able to use it without a separate charger cord and transformer.  I used the original for a while with an external charger cord and transformer.  Then it stopped holding a charge.  However, as I stated above, the replacement is still going strong after close to a year.		I'm willing to try it again because I love the convenience of no extra cord - when it's working.  And the company has been good to replace the original defective unit.
0,Received the package within a few days of ordering. I bought for my 11year old daughters iphone. She loves it  fits around all buttons . The only bad thing is the white part gets dirty real easy but other than that it is great...
0,Awesome product!
0,Nice to have
0,Excellent quality product. Ideal for covering a phone my youngest is staking claim to!
0,These are great headphones. They fit well, and the sound is very good. Price is unbeatable too. My pair did not come with extra buds, but I don't care since I never use the extra buds anyway. The buttons work, but not with every app. They can answer and end calls without any problems (at least on AT&T Galaxy SII) and start, pause and stop music but they don't work with every app consistently. However, this is still a great deal.
0,Dropped my phone.  Protector shattered at corner, but protected the screen.  Whew!
0,This is way better than I-Blason!. I had 2 of those, and phone was falling out of the holder, and the clip was coming apart, I had to repair broken glass twice. This one holds the phone very well, clip seems to be very strong and tight. Hope it will last
0,I had been making do with cheap not-so-smart phones for many years, enduring all kinds of ridicule from my tech savvy kids. When my most recent semi-smart phone started getting flakier and flakier I decided, OK, it's time to get a real smartphone.		This phone came highly recommended even though it is not the current edition. I don't have to have the latest and greatest, and in fact I've saved a lot of money buying last year's model of several high tech gizmos, so I had no trouble buying this.		It works like a champ. T-Mobile cut my old SIM card down and installed it and away I went. I must say, it's nice not to hear the sounds of my kids laughing when I complain about my old cheap phone any more.  :)
0,Good product ultra clear for 3 months then gets yellow and dingy. Moreover, it carck on the corner if you constantly take the case off.
0,love it
0,Works Great
0,Due to the design of the phone, it is very difficult to put these on. This is not a flaw with the product. The curve of the screen makes it hard to get the cover aligned properly. My only complaint about these is the feel of running your finger over it when on the phone. It's not as smooth as I would like and it picks up fingerprints quite bad. It does serve it's purpose though. Be happy it's a 2 pack as you will probably use both. First as a test run and second as the real deal.
0,Good for keeping my Galaxy Note safe and accessible while shopping.
0,I use it and useful for me .. I love it thanx

0,This is absolutely the BEST portable charger out there! It charges amazingly fast, and multiple times before it dies. The charger I was using before I could charge my phone 1 1/2 times before it died. So far, on a full charge, this one has charged my husband IPad (not fully, but kept it on while he was using it) and phone at the same time, and then my phone twice, and it hasn't died yet. Simply amazing! I love to keep this at work, but it would be great as well for someone who travels a lot, campers, hikers, etc. This is worth every penny! It is very sturdily built, but not overly heavy. The cord that comes with it is amazing. Short, flat, and sturdy. This is a great gift for anyone who own electric devices! I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.
0,Good case, lots of protection. Hard to get in and out of pocket do to the rubber.
0,I love this case. I can reverse my phone on the case to make screen visible or protected. It is good quality and held up so far. Has not broken. It slips on and off easily. I needed a clip on that can handle the stress. Everything aligned ie camera, plugs etc. Very good cost and quality.
0,Very comfortable.  Very durable.  You can't ask for anything more in a case for your phone.
0,My roommate had the google cardboard and I wanted to get one. After a little bit of research I decided I wanted something like this and looked around. Decided the only way I would get something better would be to pay a lot more. Once receiving this I really liked it. This worked like expected. The only down side was the nose piece being uncomfortable. Luckily, this came with some foam pads which I was able to use on the nose piece. Now this is pretty comfortable. I just with there were more VR apps and better VR apps for iPhone.
0,I bought it for my wife for hew new iPhone 4s. I received it on time. It looks and feels good. Easy to use.

0,Case looks and feals great. Design is well done and very pretty. Looks just like the photo. Fits the phone snugly but not too tight where it is difficult to get off, and also isn't too loose. its honestly pretty perfect. I also don't get any dirt under this case like I use to all my other cases so thats another plus!
0,I am so surprised by the nice design, good quality of this case. It is very sturdy, comfortable to grab, and the price of $9.98 is unbelievable.
0,Iphone cover is really sleek and elegant and have plastic case that is see through for yur phone and side have nice pop of color. it is an elegant maximum defense is provided by this cover made across the tips with metallic metal. Shields the rear of your phone using a resistant crystal layer layer which slides along during installation. installation was really easy and it look elegant on my phone. I got this case at free/discounted rate for testing purposes.
0,It's awesome.

0,Just received this screen protector, it arrived in the 2 day shipping as expected, great product and it looks very strong as well , had a little trouble putting it on my phone, but after installed it looks absolutely great, kind of wanting to throw my phone on the floor to try it out but im scared haha , will highly recommend		I received this product at a discount for my honest review
0,This is a really nice charger to have! A person just can't have too many chargers! It comes in a variety of colors so there's bound to be one for everybody. I have mainly used it in the house, where I usually use my Kindle. The cable is 4 feet long which is a good length but sometimes I could use one a bit longer. The price is good enough you could order a couple of these and have one in house and one in your car!
0,This is a daily carry in my work backpack. Great size, love the 2amp charging. The pouch it comes with keeps everything together.

0,Okay so I got this phone case for my sons Galaxy S6. He is very happy and really like this phone case for many reasons. The case is not necessarily slim but it is not too bulky either although it reminds me a lot of the otter box, which everyone knows and loves. I feel like this case will provide excellent protection if and when he drops his phone. The inside of the case is a black rubber like material that seems like it will be an good shock absorber as well as protect the phone from being scratched by the case itself. The outside is a bright shiny black hard plastic like material. The part my son and I like that best is that on the back of the case is a slot that will hold a couple of cards securely, like a debit card and drivers license which to be honest is usually all he carries most of the time. This is perfect for my son who often misplaces his wallet and keys, yet somehow always knows where his phone is! At least this way he will only have to search for his keys.	I received this product for at a reduced priced or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
0,Article is good attention during shipping but I reembosaron money, I recommend it.
0,I absolutely love this case!

0,I love NewTrent chargers. They're the best deal for the amount, and are just really great. This is NewTrent's largest charger right now, and I know it's kind of expensive, but it'll last, and if you charge it about 14 hours each time, it'll be ready everyday. If you only charge your phone on it a couple times everyday, just plug it in overnight and you'll always be ready to go.
0,My favorite...love it
0,Nice and sleek
0,My wife bought one and after finding myself having to borrow it a couple of times I purchased my own. Awesome power brick especially for the price! I have a smart phone, 7" tablet and a Kindle DX (yeah the huge one). So lots of stuff that can be unexpectedly discharged when I'd like to use it. testing I recharged my 4.5" Moto g smart phone 4 times plus charged my tablet on one charge of the power bank. It seems to charge my equipment faster than the chargers that came with them which is a nice bonus as well.		The construction is very good and does not look or feel cheap. It does have some weight for it's size but what do you expect from a battery pack?		Go look at the reviews for others in it's capacitcy 13000mAh and show me another that can come close to this one for the price and build quality. Great job Lumsing!!!
0,Nice
0,This iPhone 6 screen protector is a great way to keep your phone screen from getting cracked or scratched.		The kit comes in a really nice package. It includes cleaning cloths, dust removers, and stickers to guide for application. The screen protector frame is black.		I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
0,Muy buen producto
0,I got these because one of my original screws of my iphone 4s fell out, they work perfectly! Just as described
0,Such a awesome wallet! Just that I wouldn't leave debit or credit card on the top part. But it aure comes in handy when you just wanna carry your phone and card and some cash! :)
0,Works as expected!
0,Ive had several ( this is the 7th) easy acc banks and i have never had a problem with them. Flow through (charging while charging is my favorite feature)
0,Fantastic product, able to charge an iPhone 5s from 20% to full charge twice on one case battery charge.
0,Although my husband upgraded his phone to a nexus four shortly after I bought this case, he loved it and it helped keep it protected.
0,Have not tried to install yet, but looks good.
0,Good
0,No cover all screen, Transparency is good not excellent, Installation is regular, Price is right
0,SPIGEN does the job..really nice :)
0,Our in-house Apple expert just got his iPhone 7+.  Here are his comments on this case:	Overall case and leather accents feel nice.	Case is sturdy.	Magnetic clasp is strong and responsive.	Card slot is stiff, which is good, but, makes it hard to move cards in and out.	Color is unique.	Classy design that looks professional and expensive.
0,Sturdy and reliable.
0,So I was suckered at the T-Moblie store for buying 2 of these for $17 dollars. The thing is I already purchased these before I bought my new galaxy s5 phone and they didn't come in enough time before I got the phone so I settled with what they had at the store when I probably could have waited. My point is don't let the low price deter you. They fit the s5 PERFECTLY. Better in some ways and you get a enough for the price so I would recommend it.
0,I trust Anker and these cables are no exception. Safety around cables and chargers is something people should be aware of especially with the fiasco of USB Type C with the new Nexus phones. While I cannot guarantee for myself or others that these are 100% safe, Anker's reputation and standards are very high. These cables feel much more durable than any cable you will use otherwise and if you are used to the coating on the cable breaking or fraying, this is for you as those cables are not safe.
0,Great product, I really liked!!!
0,Zagg makes some of the best screen protectors. They can be a little expensive but they offer great protection! Easy installation!
0,I like the more rugged look of this band. I have been use to wearing a G-Shock watch while doing things outdoors. I really liked the Apple Watch Sport, but it still felt a little girly. I like that this band is a little bit wider and has a more rugged design to it.		It can be difficult to tuck the strap underneath. This rubber just doesn't slide well.  I found that a quick drop of water on the band fixes the problem. This simply due to the material used. I don't see it as a design flaw (unless you change the band to use a associated buckle instead of the tuck). In my opinion if you're looking for a more rugged band, this shouldn't bother you.		Spigen, if you're reading, I would live to see other color options - a blaze orange or lime green would be great.
0,great. fits pretty much forever!
0,I will stand by LifeProof cases forever. They work. They work. They work.  Just remember to check you closed the headphone port and charging portholes prior to submerging in water.
0,Good for fit and hold .
0,Perfect! Fits my iPhone 7+, keys, small wallet, readers & lipstick. Exactly what I was looking for.  The vendor even sent me an extension to make the strap longer.  Very nice little bag.
0,This case is very unique.
0,My phone screen still looking good because of the screen protector
0,Perfect case for the iPhone 6 Plus. Great price, and easy to put on and take off (something that drives me crazy about some iPhone cases is how hard they are to get on and off). The pink color is very vibrant and pretty -- looks great with my new silver 6 Plus! Love the clear back, and it came with a protective screen on both sides so it arrived without any scratches!
0,This is an awesome case! What I was hoping it would be and it fits perfect! I hope it will continue to impress me after use but for now it's perfect!
0,Bright pink and full of sparkle! I haven't used it yet but I like it a lot! I recommend if you are girly and want glam sparkle-its so cute!
0,This is my favorite case from any manufacturer and that's saying a lot considering I prefer to have my iPhone naked most of the time. I love how thin this case is and easy to use one handed without a lot of bulk. Can see how beautiful the iPhone is while still inside the case. I would buy this case again.
0,Great product!!!
0,Love it, will buy again.
0,Was looking for a smaller smart phone that wasn't just junk. This little guy does the job and was very reasonably priced.
0,1byone's 3-port car charger is ideal when you are on the road, traveling with different devices.		We all know the WORST thing that can ever happen when you are away from home is to lose your charge or connection to the world. This charger fits literally in the palm of your hand and is all you need when it comes to making sure you have juice on the go.		Definitely suggest this be one of those things you keep inside the handy box it's packaged in and in your car. You can't go wrong with it.

0,Excellent for my Edge 7, I was having issues trying to hold the phone without touching the edges,  ... This has made it much easier to maneuver!
0,Light and minimal
0,as described
0,This thing SWALLOWS the Nokia Lumia 1520.  I could have a VERY THICK case on the phone and it would still have room.		FOUR MONTHS LATER:	This case has been on my hip every day since it came in.  YESTERDAY, the front belt STRAP broke.  The clip and the rear strap are still intact.  120 days is pretty good, but not good enough for it to keep a five-star rating.  SIX months would have been the minimum life expectancy for a case of this quality.		I am off to find a new case...
0,good buy
0,I was reading reviews before buying the case, and I don't usually write reviews either. But the seller seems like a really hard working person and asked really nicely. This is a great product, I am super satisfied and really like the case. Looks great, feels great. Will definitely recommend my friends to buy.
0,My arm is really skinny and it stays on perfect! Definently worth the 3 bucks. I would recommend buying this.
0,Just last week, my Galaxy S4 started to have problems charging.  Despite using different chargers (and even swapping out the battery with another), my phone would exhibit the symptom of charging/uncharging/charging/uncharging repeatedly.  Actually charging it would cause my battery to go down because every time you plug in a charger, the screen comes on temporarily.  To charge my phone successfully, I had to power it off and let it charge via that method.		Having replaced screens before on past phones (including the Galaxy S4), I found you could just buy the USB assembly as well.  A cell phone repair shop said it would cost $80 to fix... then I found this part, for $7.35 from seller "Messi Franco".  I opted for 1-day shipping and it was delivered to my door the next day.  Brand new part for under $10.		The tools that came with it are the same as any other generic cell phone tool.  They'll help you get the job done if you have no existing tools, but they aren't necessary at all.		I used the screwdriver, took off the screws.  Used my fingernails to pop some of the molding off.  Removed the old USB assembly, then added this one back.  Put everything back together and my phone was as good as new again.  No issues charging.		As for the part, it's legit.  Comparing it to the one that I removed from my phone, they are IDENTICAL.  Even down to the text printed on the PCB.		Great item to repair your phone yourself without having to get gouged by those cell phone repair shops.
0,Nice item got it today well made  I plugged in both sockets to charge my and my wife's phone good to go and it has a spare fuse. As backup  other then that good to go
0,Love this case! Definitely a nicely handcrafted product! The leather is very soft and is made with quality material. My iPhone 6S fits terrific in this case, but it is quite snug and getting it back out easily is not very easy... but at least I don't have to worry about it falling out! This particular model is the newer 2015 version, and as was told to me; was made from a softer microfiber leather and altered ever so slightly to ensure fitment for the iPhone 6S model (as well as the older iPhone 6 model). I was curious if there really was a difference because another reseller had it for a cheaper price... so I also purchased the older model&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iPhone-6S-case-Jisoncase-PU-Leather-Book-Folio-Flip-Design-Phone-Shell-Holsters-Skin-With-Fully-Protective-for-iPhone-6S-and-iPhone-6-4-7-Pure-Manual-Magnetic-Closure-in-Rose-JS-IP6-32H33/dp/B011AY5RMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iPhone 6S case, Jisoncase PU Leather Book Folio Flip Design Phone Shell Holsters Skin With Fully Protective for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6(4.7'') [Pure Manual] [Magnetic Closure] in Rose(JS-IP6-32H33)</a>&nbsp;to see what the difference really was between the two... I also just noticed the older model listing was updated to show the 6S in the title for the item, so they may now be selling the updated version like this one. Honestly I can tell you that the difference from old to new was exactly as stated to me by JISTORE and this 2015 version is a softer microfiber leather. The difference between them is not extremely noticeable unless you're looking for it though, and the coloring is identical. When putting this newer version next to the older version, you cannot see any difference, but you can somewhat tell by the feel of the leather, but mostly by the stability of the seam for the front cover. The seam for the front cover of the newer version is not as durable, obviously because it is made with a softer leather. The older version actually fit my 6S just as well, and the seam for opening/closing the cover was not as loose/sloppy. While the cover seam on the newer version is a softer leather, the rest of the case is completely the same with functionality and strength. There are indentations for the volume buttons, but as other mentioned... you cannot access the switch with the cover closed and you have to open the case cover to use it. The seam is the only issue I felt was a noticeable difference between the two. Hopefully they will update the design to put something within the seam to make it more durable. I am pretty worried about it wearing out and/or tearing over time with use. I may have gotten a subpar case and am actually considering getting a replacement just to be sure. If I do, I may update this review if it's better. I was unsure on whether to return this one and just keep the older version for that very reason. Also, as mentioned by other reviewers, the older version does have a funny smell like you would get with a cheaper 'pure' PU leather product, but the newer version with the softer 'microfiber' PU leather does not have that smell at all. One feature I love about both cases, is that they have the same interior lining; which is a softly stamped suede leather to help protect the surface of your device. Even the outside leather is folded over the edges on the interior, and there are no foreign materials exposed to cause damage to your device. I love that there is 100% suede & leather on ever inch of the case and you don't have to worry about your device getting scratched. I recently went back into the iPhone again after several years of being in the Samsung Galaxy units, and I was accustomed to a much sturdier & harder material cover (with a stronger seam) by Samsung&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samsung-Galaxy-S5-Wireless-Charging-Case-S-View-Flip-Cover-Folio-White/dp/B00ITI23LY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samsung Galaxy S5 Wireless Charging Case S View Flip Cover Folio - White</a>&nbsp;and I guess initially I wasn't expecting such a handcrafted case... but it was actually a pleasant surprise and I really do love this case and would recommend it!
0,This far exceeded my expectations. It's not only stylish, It's design is beautiful, nicely grips my phone and just all around feels great. However there is one con to this I must add. It is HIGHLY slippery. Though this is not an issue at all because i still have no problems holding it. But otherwise it's practically perfect. Thank you guys. This purchase is far more than worth it.
0,Got a Note 5 for work and needed an inexpensive case for it.  There isn't that much on the market for a Note 5 anymore when the Note 9 just came out.  But I am super pleased with this.  Awesome feel in the hand, unlike the naked phone which constantly felt like it was going to slip out of my hands.  Even comes with a screen protector (though only one) and a rear anti-rainbow effect layer for the back so it looks good against the back rubber of the case, nice touch too!  Love it!
0,It does what its suppose to!
0,These phone holders are just right for traveling. They take up no valuable space in my backpack, they work well and they are inexpensive. Sounds like a Hat Trick.
0,Cheap quality, does not stick well..
0,Wanted a waterproof case for my Galaxy Note 2 to protect it while I'm out on my SUP (standup paddleboard).  This case works perfectly, and still allows full use of the phone.  I was wary of putting my phone into the case with my Spigen screen protector on it after reading a review about a Zagg screen protector getting stuck to the case, but I haven't had any issue at all even on 90 degree days.  I always make sure to leave some air in the case so that the cover doesn't stick to my screen protector, so maybe if you forced all the air out it might get stuck if it was really hot - easy fix, don't squeeze the air out!
0,Went on perfectly, easiest glass screensaver I've ever installed!		I L.O.V.E. the matte screen.	The feel is silky smooth.	Fingerprints don't show up.		Love love love!  If you knew me, you'd realize this is high praise. I can rip products apart. I have written to Mothca to see if they will produce the Ipad & Amazon Fire HD screen in matte. I would buy them in a heartbeat.		I paid for the product in full.
0,Great gadget!  Could've beena tad longer say by 6"
0,So far, this is the best phone accessory I've bought (and I've bought a lot).  Due to arthritis, my hands aren't reliable most days and I'm always afraid I'll drop my phone and break it.  I bought this on a whim based on the reviews and I have to say, I've been really impressed.  I've been using it for almost a week now and it's still sticking true, allowing me to keep a good grip on my phone without relying on (or hurting) my joints.		Note: A couple of people have commented that the strap is too tight.  That's probably true.  I have pretty small hands and I usually hold it with my smallest two fingers (because my phone is activated with my index finger on the back of my phone) and it does get a little uncomfortable after a long period of use (30 minutes or more).  It hasn't been uncomfortable enough for me to stop using it, but I do notice that it's tight on my fingers.  That being said, if you have really large hands, you may find this strap uncomfortable to use.
0,Works great very handy to have with multiple devices to keep charged
0,This is a great quality case and is worth every penny. Good quality plastic and I feel like my phone is very well protected, even though the case is hardly visible. Great product.
0,Perfect for travelling. I can charge my powerbank, phone in same time. Quickcharge 3 is really fast !
0,nice and thick, very clear
0,Look adds a grip to my phone so it doesn't fall. and the design is very elegant!
0,Ive been using the green one for two years now, and just bought the pink one since my girlfriend is taking my iPhone 6s. This is a great case, it slips on and off without too much trouble (but stays secure otherwise) and protects the iPhone quite well from drops. Ive accidentally swiped it off my desk at work, dropped it on the bathroom tile, and all sorts of me-not-paying-attention, and my iPhone 6s is none the worse for it. It does get pretty scuffed over time but thats something youve just got to accept with a clear TPU case.
0,Holds the cell phne securely. Would refer this to anyone looking for Samsung Brightside holder. Nothing to dislike about it.
0,Like this cell a lot. Battery is not as good as my last one. This is a good upgrade from working with a S3. I hope to get the unlock key soon as to  AT and T has just to much junk added to their cells for my liking.
0,Really nice...and effective!!
0,This is an awesome charger!! It never gets hot, charges my iPhone 2 times, and is super fast. It's worth every penny. We use it all the time. Faster charging than the wall cord charge. You'll be happy with it. Slim, fast and efficient.
0,These cables appear a bit sturdier than others I have tried. I have not, however, noticed any decreased charge time by using these. Still, this is a good collection of different lengths of micro USB cables- all of which have come in handy. I have several Anker brand products and they always seem like decent quality and, considering the competitive pricing, a great value.
0,Very lovely plus the writing at the back.
0,As others pointed out, the case fits snug but is easy on/off. There is a knurling finish along the sides for a good grip, and the matte finish on the back is smooth enough that it slides in and out of a pant pocket easily. Another unexpected bonus is that the volume rocker is not exposed. Before buying the case, I found that I was always adjusting the volume inadvertently. The cover makes it a bit less sensitive.		The only minor fault I have with the case is a small protrusion with two holes on the back bottom right, which I presume is for attaching a lanyard or stylus tether. The bump only sticks out a 1/16" or so, but it is enough to cause the device to rock (and make a tapping noise) when used on a flat hard surface. I have no use for a lanyard, so I removed the bump using a Dremel tool and a small cone sander. Others may find the attachment point to be a plus.. Either way the case is a bargain at $10.
0,Case came as described, fit is prefect. Grandson loves the case and the price was right. 5 STARS!!!!!!
0,Great normal case. It looks like kate spade for a fraction of the cost
0,Better than expected. Easy to install. It did take 72 hours for the air bubbles to completely disappear. Makes my white iphone 6 plus look like a black phone.
0,Beautiful quality!
0,Item was just as described and easy to install.
0,Love it and it's made strong !!!
0,High quality glass screen protector, I can't even tell there's one on my phone its so nice. Easy application, no bubbles or fog, it's clear as day. I would recommend getting this one also because it comes with 2 screen protectors!
0,Great, good quality product and I love
0,I previously had the "Aduro Shell Holster Combo Case for Samsung Galaxy S5"  I really like the function of that one, but it broke and I decide to try this one.  This one definitely has better damage protection. They are using a rubbery material  as a lining to protect against sudden impact.  That's all fine, but the hard shell does not extend on the bottom.  That combined with the rubbery grip sides makes it very difficult to remove from the holster when clipped to my belt.  Works fine if you can pull it exactly straight up- very difficult when hanging on your side.  I get my phone in and out constant, so this is extremely irritating to me.  I will be acquiring a different case.  My wife has offered to take it since she wouldn't normally use the holster.  We will see....	Update:  The image shown here on Amazon shows the phone sitting facing out inside the holster with the clip acting as a kickstand.  The clip does have capability of acting as a stand but the phone will never fit inside the holster facing out with the shell attached- the design has a curve on rear edges that is not on the front.  So that functionality isn't possible.  The shell has a separate kickstand that functions fine.	Update:  A company that cares- they wanted me to be happy and offered me a replace of another style of my choice.  Even though the original unit had some shortcomings, I give it 5 stars for the customer service.
0,Since I got my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S5, I've struggled to find a case that is reasonably priced, protects my device, but does not add a lot of bulk to my device. I've tried a number of cases now and have not found one that I really like yet and I don't really want to spend the insane amount of money for the OB cases. This New Trent case is my favorite so far.		- The price is reasonable and it seems to protect my device well.	- I have not noticed any issues with my device getting too hot, like I have had with other cases.	- The case is a little bulky, but is definitely tolerable.	- When I ordered the case I didn't realize that it had a screen protector integrated into the case. When I opened the box, I was surprised and a little concerned as I've never had luck with them in the past. To my surprise, I have not noticed any response issues from the screen protector. I was also surprised that the screen protector doesn't seem to interfere with the fingerprint scanner.	- The case is a little cumbersome to put together, but really seems to protect the phone. It fits together very snug but is not something you will want to take a part very often.	- As you know the S5 has the flap/cover that protects the charging port. Most of the other cases I've tried has made it very difficult to get that flap open. New Trent did their homework from that perspective and the flap / cover is very easy to get to for charging.	- I find the case comfortable to use, it allows me to grip my phone better when using it in landscape.	- I did not find the interchangeable covers to be of any benefit at all. They are really quite difficult to swap out. I have a white S5 so it would be nice if they offered a white case.	- I would prefer that the interchangeable covers have some sort of a texture to them. They are very slick, so I make it a point to grab the edge of my phone rather than the back.
0,This is the best charger ever for the fit bit blaze. I love how I don't have to remove my fit bit to charge it and it charges must faster than the original one.
0,Works great! I got these to replace my old cord that got chewed on and they work just as expected. A++++
0,Great fit without extra space on the edges, like some.
0,Great case!
0,great cable for a great price. lifetime warranty is also good. I used it once to get a new cord after mine was loose fitting on my phone.
0,The wife loves it
0,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  First of all, this is a great that is made from a quality material.  It fits my Samsung S6 Edge; however, it is very roomy.  The product description states to leave your regular case on the phone in addition to this one for a tighter fit.  I don't like the thick layered cases, so I still had plenty of room to slide my keys in there.  This works for me so I don't have the bulge in pants  pockets.  It very secure and doesn't slide.  Overall, I like this case and will use it more when attended my daughter's sporting events so I don't have to carry a wristlet or purse.
0,Excelente
0,Absolutely love this! Definitely better quality than those bought at Walmart or on the street. It works great and I've had it for over a year!
0,Pros		-Good protection.  Coverage is good enough, and the material is durable enough that I'm not worried about it lasting.	-Easy to keep bubble-free.  Just roll it onto a clean screen.	-Good feel.  By biggest complaint about most screen protectors is that they're sticky and attract scratches, making it feel rough.  This screen protector has held up very well and still maintains a very smooth feel after months.	-Easy to clean.		Cons		-I'm not overly impressed with the shape.  It comes very close to the edges of the phone at the top and bottom, but has a considerable gap on the left and right edges.  This makes alignment for the front-facing camera and proximity sensor notches more difficult than it should be.  Also, since it comes so close to the edges at the top and bottom, I had to trim the edges of the screen protector to keep by phone's bumper case from pulling up on the edges of the screen protector.		Overall, these screen protectors are a good value.  Slight hiccup with my bumper case conflict aside, I would buy these protectors again.  If you use a case of any kind for your Nexus 4 (and you probably should with that fragile glass back), just be careful that it doesn't wrap around the bezel far enough to interfere with the edges of your screen protector BEFORE you install.  Fixing it after installation is much more difficult than fixing it before.
0,It exceeds my expectations! My Mega charging dock doesn't work so well so I needed a battery charger and decided to try this...well guess what?! My phone charges great using this charging dock!!!! All issues are addressed!  I am VERY VERY VERY HAPPY!!!! (I bought 2 and put one in kitchen and one in office)  THANK YOU!!
0,This case may be half the price of the phone (or almost the whole price if you find a sale/rebate), but IMO it's better than having to buy a replacement phone and set everything back up. Before the Defender I had a Beyond Cell Tri-Shield which I also reviewed which I accidentally broke while taking it apart to clean my phone. I then decided to use a TPU case which are great for corner drops but one face-down drop on concrete shattered my screen. Luckily I had an accidental protection plan so the phone was replaced for free. This time I decided to spend the extra money on this case rather than the plan since the plan only covers two years anyway and I plan on keeping this phone as long as humanly possible...I'm not rich and I want to get a long life out of my devices.		As far as the added bulk, I have large hands and I have a much better grip on it now especially with the silicone outer layer. Personally, I wish more phones were made this way so a case wouldn't be needed. IMO looks mean nothing if a single drop can shatter your screen and having a thin and light phone is overrated. Another advantage of the outer layer being soft is it bounces rather than slides if you drop it and it doesn't scratch as easily as polycarbonate. I think it has a industrial/utilitarian look to it which is a negative to many people but I love it.		The only thing I don't like is the built-in screen protector because it scratches so easily so I just popped it out and cleaned the adhesive from the case with alcohol. Yes, I know Gorilla glass can be scratched by sand etc. but with the phone's screen being recessed so far into the case, dropping isn't likely to scratch the screen and I'm willing to put up with minor scratches that I may get over time. The only downside to this is dust getting under the lip surrounding the screen but a weekly disassembly and cleaning isn't that bad.		Overall I love the Otterbox Defender and won't fault the screen protector because I'd rather remove it rather than replace it when it gets scratched up (if they even sell replacements).
0,These batteries work awesome! They are better than the original batteries that came with the phones. Very Happy! Thanks!!
0,Pros:	Synced quickly with Galaxy Note 3 using MapMyRide	Cost	I like the strap design over the Polar straps I'm used to with side snaps.  Connecting the strap unfront at the  monitor is much easier	Accurate, agreed with my Polar HRM when I would them together		Cons:	Small strap: I have a 46 inch chest and the strap is fully extended.  You might need a larger strap if you have a bigger Chest
0,The plug in hole if smaller it would better	All the rest looking very nice !
0,The cleanest cut case I've ever seen. I received my case yesterday, 2-26-2014, and I have to say that it is much better then i had expected. The case feels well designed and i would say this case is more for casual to professional use. I actually just liked the simplistic design. Regardless when I had received my product I had immediately opened it. Even the package design was interestingly simplistic but yet sophisticated. I opened the packaging and there was a nice little "THANK YOU" card and I appreciate that.  I plan to support companies that keep a well priced, well designed product such as this. The case itself had a thin protector for the brushed metal back panel and the black surfaces of the case have a smooth almost velvety feel to it. Overall this case is an eye pleaser with sturdy and comfortable minimalistic design. I would recommend this to all my friends, not to mention I've gotten compliments all day from many of them. And no, Thank you, Elago!
0,Snapped on just fine. Seems a little bit thinner than apples band but it still is very nice and it stays on my wrist very nicely without feeling like it will fall off.
0,Excellent!!!
0,fits well on my AT&T G3 and works quite well on the PowerMat
0,I am a "Red Hatter" and  since we "red Hatters" wear purple and Red, I wanted a phone cover that I could use when we all get together. This phone cover is PERFECT! The purple is beautiful and looks quilted with bling stones everywhere! I can't wait to show it off to all my red hat friends!
0,Very beautiful and practical attractive colors.
0,Sum up of my review - It is two different parts to it. I discovered that when I tryed to take off the pink and it worked. It would look more stylish if the white part was clear but that's just my opinion. I would probably get this as a gift for someone.		Full review- It is two different parts to it. I discovered that when I tryed to take off the pink and it worked. It would look more stylish if the white part was clear but that's just my opinion. when I put it on my phone it felt very secure and like it would protect my phone very well. Overall I would recommend buying this even tho I would rather the white be clear. But I do not know why it would come in rose gold because I'm pretty sure that Samsung does not have any rose gold phones. But it is a pretty pink ... Rose gold is just a fancier way to say pink. But I do think it looks stunning on my Samsung Galaxy s7 and I would probably get this as a gift for someone. If this review helped you in any way please vote helpful. If you have any questions feel free to ask! I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest unbiased review. But this in any way doesn't affect my review.
0,Love the theme of this case. Colors are more vibrant than it looks. Saving this one for Halloween:). The turquoise is nice but would love to see different colors in the future. Thanks Maxboost for the opportunity to review your innovative products
0,got wireless charger in fair amt. of time. well worth the wait.	works great. would buy again
0,I love this case.  Not bulky, very streamlined.
0,When I ordered these, they came on the promptly on the estimated delivery date. It went on easily, no bubbles & looks great!
0,I've purchased several of these now and highly recommend them. The hard case that holds the phone will crack if dropped but PROTECTS THE PHONE FROM DAMAGE!!!
0,I got this product for free for review purposes.		I think this case is really great. It feels sturdy and like it would protect my phone. The gunmetel color is really nice and looks great on my phone. The buttons on the side of the phone are really stiff to start out with but they soften over time. I really like this phone case.
0,Perfect case. Returned my LifeProof for this.
0,very good
0,Works well enough for my husband.
0,The cord could be longer, otherwise another great anker product.
0,Very nicely design. I liked it
0,This is a great phone. It has everything it is advertised with. I wasn't expecting to get the free headset, so that is a bonus. The only really disappointing thing about this phone is that despite having 2 gigs of RAM, you get to use less than 1 of them because the OS uses so much of it already. Don't get me wrong, the phone is still fast, and it hardly stutters on 3D games, but I figured I could get tons of multitasking out of it. Other wise, it lived up to all expectations, even the only having 9 gigs to work with on the phone itself. A big plus that I wasn't aware of though, is that you can move some select apps to your SD card. That makes this phones memory go a whole lot farther and the fact that it has an SD slot made it a pick over the LG G2. It still feels rather fragile and I am kind of worried about breaking it because my case has not arrived yet. But overall, I love the phone.
0,Great product.  I like the way it feels on the device.  Easy to install.  Just follow directions and be patient.  Don't jerk the shield around when installing, just slide, or peel back off, put more spray on it and try again.  Yes, the very small bubbles will dissipate, just get the large ones out at time of installation.
0,I really liked this case referred over the hard case. It's like a glove easy to remove from the phone and gaining access to the back of the phone. Unlike the two-piece hard case which is a little more difficult. I give the seller two thumbs up and appreciate the very fast shipping quality of the product.
0,Excelent product
0,amFilm's screen protectors are hands down the easiest to install on your device. This is coming from a person who installs many different screen protectors for their family and friends from a wide range of companies. I definitely will be returning to order screen protectors for my other devices in the future.
0,Bought it as a gift for my friend, apparently she loved it. Good protection, and looks nice, and doesn't make the iPhone super heavy.
0,Excellent glass screen protector just as describe
0,Great band
0,This is a must-have for anyone with multiple devices needing a daily charge. It's great for at home to leave plugged in and also for travel. I especially love the fact that it has a fold-away plug.	*In the interest of full disclosure I received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.
0,I really like this case! I got it for my friend to decorate for me and it was perfect :) good quality and looked good even before i decorated it. I ordered another one after I got the first in the mail! It comes with a free gift too, which is always a plus :)
0,Took off a star bc hard to line up without pulling off to re align. Has to be stuck perfectly to fit around home button bc no margin for error. I got bubble at top left from removing a couple times to re align. Otherwise the glass is great.
0,Came in handy for my teens who love watching videos on their phones. Great novelty item.
0,2 part case consisting on a rubber insert. Good combination of slimish case and phone protection. First one broke and they sent me a replacement. Great customer service.
0,The case is pretty good.  It is exactly as described online in the description.  The case is slim and durable, however, the silicone protective piece is very flimsy and stretches easily.  the bottom portion the protects the bottom of my phone has already stretched a bit and does not fit as snug as it did the first few days.
0,ok
0,Great battery, it lasted a lot of use.  Charges quickly and holds the charge for a long time. Anker never disappoints. Thank you.
0,I love these protectors. Save your screen!  I have dropped my tablet face first and had no damage. Very durable. Even if the glass protector cracks, your screen will be safe.
0,excellent
0,The Bluetooth operation and the flexible holder make it versatile and usable. I wonder if it works in the shower. Or maybe around corners for those shot of animals before they think to look up?		I say that Savannah Guthrie on the today show put her selfie-stick in a time capsule. Wonder what they will think in the future. Will this critter ever go out of style?
0,A1
0,AS EXPECTED.
0,So good for what has been said
0,Bought for a friend. Fit phone real well. He loves the kickstand.
0,It's all you need to have another battery for your phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy Ace, and when I use it all like wifi hot spot I need an aditional battery
0,good stuff
0,I read the negative (1-star) reviews before deciding on buying the product. As with every Amazon high volume purchase product, the Halo Screen Protector has many negative reviews. It also has ten-fold in 5-star reviews. I took a chance because of the price. I bought two packages for our two Samsung Galaxy Note 4 phones. The film "seemed" a little thinner than the GreatShield screen protector that I used previously. Being (seemingly) thinner is not necessary negative (a con) in this case because it may be better for use with the S-Pen. As it turned out, some of the negative reviewers may have installed the product incorrectly and/or their process was not a dust-free install.		Halo emailed a YouTube URL, showing viewers how to install a screen protector. I watched the video. I installed a protector based on the "How To" video, complemented with my own method for installing a screen protector. There was "one" speck of dust under the screen protector. Perhaps, those negative reviews correctly trashed the product and the quality control because of dust on the adhesive side. It wasn't the case. The problem was in the installation process. I modified my original process slightly and successfully installed the protectors on to two Samsung Galaxy Note 4 phones without any dust micro-bubbles.		Here my process, hopefully you will be able to install the protectors without any bubbles:		1. Use alcohol and a microfiber (lint-free) cloth to clean the screen. Use the one that comes with the product or your own. Don't believe in the "lint free" misnomer, there will be lint (dust) on the screen. You may not be able to see them until they form micro-bubble. The following steps should take care of those hard to see dust particles.		2. Tape the screen with strips of "Duck" packaging tape (1.88 in wide), overlap the strips to cover the entire screen, press down on the tape so that the hard to see dust will stick to the tape, then pulled the tape off. You can do this step as many times as you wish. The purpose is to remove hard to see dust.		3. Tape (overlap the strips to cover the entire screen) the screen again. Do not remove the tape this time, just leave it for now. It will keep dust off the screen while you align and prepare the screen protector for installation.		4. Position the screen protector: (a) align the cut-out to the screen and (b) the protector "Step 1" pull-off is on the screen. The protector "Step 1" pull-off is the adhesive side. If you reverse the film, you will end-up with the sticky side up and the protector falling off later. Perhaps some of the "1-star" reviewers installed the protector incorrectly.		Note: The protector film is slightly smaller than the phone screen surface. If it's an exact fit, it would be difficult to install.		5. Tape the protector to the edge of the phone (on one side) to create a hinge as in the installation video. Tape the entire side, not sparingly as in the video. Taping the entire side will keep the film from shifting or moving during the actual install.		Note: Even if you followed instructions in the video precisely, the alignment stage (step 4 and 5) may transfer dust from the protector (throw away cover) to the screen, causing dust micro-bubble later. By leaving the tape in place (step 3), the dust is transferred to the tape.		6. Flip the protector film (as in the video) off and back on to make sure the hinge will hold and the alignment is still intact. Re-align and re-tape the hinge as needed.		7. Pull on "Step 1" sticker label to loosen the entire length of the film, but do not pull it off.		8. Now, remove the tape covering the screen. The screen should be dust free.		9. "Slowly" peel off "Step 1" sticker and the protective side, while carefully put the protector film on the screen. If there is any bubble (large or small) formed under the protector, just lift the protector then lay it down again. Continue the process slowly, until you have the protector film completely cover the screen. If you did it slowly and carefully, there should be no bubble between the screen and the protector.		Note: Do not remove "Step 2" protective cover until you have removed the bubbles. Use "Step 2" protective cover to protect the protector film. The film is soft and may get damage when you try to remove bubbles with a credit card.		10. Use a credit card (as in the video) or something softer with a flat edge to remove "any" bubbles.		11. After removing all annoying bubbles, hold the protector down near "Step 2" sticker label while lifting the "Step 2" sticker label. Slowly peel off the protective cover.		You should have a perfectly installed screen protector...... not bubble, what so ever.....		The rating should be 4.9 because one of the screen protectors didn't have a cut out for the front camera.... I am sure that Halo didn't have quality control in place to examine every protector that was cut by the machine. That's why there are 3 sheets per package. Halo should surprise by returning my purchase price, for defending the negative reviews.		Update 01/24/2015 - Did I say "thinner" above? It's soft....	The GreatShield I installed on my SamSung Galaxy II, 4 years later - no scratch. Sadly, I can't say the same for Halo. Somehow (not sure, how I could have scratched it), a scratch appeared on the protector. I thought I may have butt-cracked the screen. I lifted the protector to check the screen. It was not the screen. Since I didn't know what had happened, I would leave my 5-star rating in place.
0,Good quality, light weight smooth silky feel to the case
0,I absolutely LOVE this case and TRUST me its WORTH GETTING! I actually have 4 cases of this kind, just in different designs & I love all 4 of them. Its easy to put on AND to take off!!!! I couldn't ask for a better case......it does protect your i5 & it fits perfectly! I would definitely recommend this case to anyone! I LOVE IT!
0,This is a high quality case and very attractive and compact. Adds very little bulk for a leather case. One thing I really like about it is the fact that it's very easy to get the phone in and out. For some that may be a negative. If I were to drop this case on the ground I'd say there's a good chance the phone would pop out. But I buy cases mostly to protect my phone from being scratched up by other stuff I might be carrying in my pocket (keys for instance). I've recently installed Android Auto on my phone and being able to quickly and effortlessly pop the handset out to place it on my phone mount is a real plus.		I only wish this case had a stand function as well.
0,Works. Love the tempered glass screen protectors. Haven't been buying anything else! This one was for my mom.
0,This screen protector is easy to put on since I've put so many on in the past.  At first when it's squeegeed out, it may look like it's cloud or have micro bubbles.  THESE WILL GO AWAY.  Once they go away, the screen is quite smooth and it's barely noticeable.  My issue is that with use, the "self-healing" doesn't work.  With just a month of use, all of the "dents" and "lines" in the material that were caused by keys and other things do not fully go away.  With the screen on, it's not at all noticeable.  Regardless, I would much rather have this on my phone than a glass screen protector that doesn't fully cover the glass or fully seal.
0,Works well for what I need it for because I like a kick stand to watch videos or charging it and for my night stand.
0,Excellent
0,okay, so like others have said, this is made fairly flimsily.  it is pretty cheap and thin plastic.  that ledge would easily break if dropped from a short distance and it hits wrong.  for sure, those are definitely cons.		pros, i have tried now 4 of these qi charging stands, all of them said they could charge my g4 through the back and this is the ONLY ONE of the stand type that would charge my lg g4.  then on top of that, you can change the orientation of the phone by moving that ledge up and down.  it is pretty neat actually overall.  and that ledge holds pretty securely.  i haven't had any slips and it screws into the back so it will hold.		though it is flimsy, who is going to be moving this around?!  it is going to sit on my desk and charge my phone but if you did need to move it regularly, like put it in a bag or something, i would not suggest this.		also, it does not come with an ac adapter, i would suggest getting a 2 amp one for it.		as for the price, it is a little steep but it depends on how bad you want a stand...overall, i am happy with it.
0,Very comfortable and I have huge arms. I'm curvy and plus size and this fits well. I've recommended it to my other work out buddies. Well made. Fits my iPhone 5 well without a case.
0,Great case, fits well.
0,Bought a second one to always have back up. These are the best!!  Well with buying!!
0,Nice. Thank you
0,just what i needed!
0,Great quality and very easy to put on, much easier than my last one. This is a must buy if you need a screen protector.
0,This case is very tight and form-fitting. It allows easy access to all the ports, but I must remove the case to use my sound system (I have to plug a really thick Belkin adapter into my phone). For general use and use with headphones the case will be fine. The case has a nice "lip" over the edges of the screen which eases my fear of putting the phone face-down.		While this case is great for the money, there are a couple minor issues/drawbacks. For one, it makes the buttons really squishy. The Moto Shell fixes this for double the cost, so I think I will survive with squishy buttons for now. Also, the black gloss on the back is a fingerprint magnet. The matte finish everywhere else is very nice.		As another reviewer noted, there are seams on the outside that do make the case feel cheap. These seams are almost unnoticeable to me and I don't think anyone will find they detract from the overall purpose of a case: Protecting the phone.		Speaking of which, this case does a decent job. On my previous phone I had a gel/hard combination case which protected the phone well but  was extremely bulky. The Moto E is bulky as is, and this case doesn't add much heft to the phone while still protecting the case from scratches and damage from drops.		This would be 5 stars, if not for my personal desire for a bigger cutout for the headphone jack. This is a minor issue and I will cut the case to make room for the adapter.		Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps! I would greatly appreciate it if you hit the "thumbs up" button below to show appreciation and to motivate me to write more reviews. If  you have any questions or concerns, please comment below and I will respond ASAP.
0,Very Good
0,love it
0,Great case! Simple,lightweight yet durable enough to protect your expensive phone. The case does not hinder performance of the iPhone 6. If you want a simple case and to keep the elegant look of your phone, this is it.
0,Loved it so much I bought it twice! Hahah. I have 3 cards in it - isn't bulky or invasive and good protection!
0,This case has come up several times as a recommended case for the note 5 by various people/websites so I definitely had high hopes when ordering it. Upon arrival you can definitely tell a difference between a good case and a cheap case just by looking at the packaging. The case itself comes in a nice box that displays the case clearly for a potential buyer. As with other cheaper cases, you generally just end up getting it in a plastic bag. That alone obviously doesn't make it a great case but once you open it and feel it you can see what makes the wavelength series so great. The back side of the case has a ribbed texture that greatly increases your grip on this larger phone. To some people with smaller hands this is probably a huge selling point but even if that's never a problem for you, this added grip alone is very welcome. I want to describe it as a rubbery feel to it that along with the ribbed pattern gives you a tremendous amount of grip but this isn't just plain rubber as it doesn't get caught up with other fabrics which is something that can be annoying if you generally store the phone in your pocket and are constantly taking it out. Whatever the material is, it's a very nice, smooth grippy feel to it. Add to that a great overall fit, good port alignment, and elegant looks, you have yourself a very competitive case that should be on everyone's potential case list. As the box also clearly states, this is a great balance in size/protection. It's not too bulky and unnecessarily armored in order to keep it slim and usable on a daily basis. I received this product at a discount for a fair, unbiased review.
0,I started using this device when my friend purchased it. The brand and everything was foreign to me. It is a wonderful product! It is light weight and compact, and holds a charging capability for up to a week! It is ideal to use at work or on the road. I have bought my own since, and am hoping to purchase one for my husband soon. I am able to charge my iPhone and iPad simultaneously, which is not only convenient but down right amazing! It is a wonderful product, it comes in proper packaging and is well made. I have recommended this to many friends and family members, and I intent on gifting it a lot!
0,Fit my iPhone 6s perfectly. Nice and clean. Came with wipes and a sticker to clean my screen beforehand. Definitely a good protector to use.
0,My son love it.
0,I love this charger. It works awesome for my iphone4s and it charges the phone pretty quickly. Great product for the price.
0,Everything now a days is charged via USB cables. Sad part is the adapter to charge those nifty gadgets most of the time are not included. That is where the Bolse Rapid 4-Port 20W USB Charger comes in. Now you can simultaneously charge your smartphone, digital camera, iPad or tablet and Bluetooth on one adapter.		Take it along with you anywhere. With it's convenient flip down prong, it can easily go in a purse, carry-on bag or suitcase/messenger bag. Has power LED light to let you know unit is correctly plugged in, and has built-in over charging protection. That means when your electronic gadgets are 100% charged, the unit stops charging it so it does not become over charged or over heated.		Ports are listed as follows:	Port 1 and 2: (Universal) 1 Amp each	Port 3: (iPad) 2 Amps	Port 4 (Samsung/Universal) 1 Amp		The iPad does require 2.1 Amps for amble charging, but because this charger has rapid charging rating at 20W with 4Amps at 5V, that means it does a fine job at charging my iPad Air since it is doing it a faster speed than most other USB chargers.		Bolse is becoming well known as a great company offering a wide variety of portable power needs, and this just proves they just keep looking for better ways to make charging faster and more portable.		Comes with a one-year limited warranty.		Sample provided for review.
0,Love it. As described
0,Clunky and oversized like a tank for your phone. Worth it for you, butter fingers
0,This case was cute but it was very hard to hold because it is hard plastic and slippery. The buttons on the side fell off after a lot of use
0,Awesome stand for your desk. Height is acceptable, not too high or low. Best feature is the ability to adjust the angle! Open a text book with your iPad and place it on this stand and type away on your laptop!
0,Works great! Now I can keep tabs on my battery and my alternator.
0,So much more convenient, works great.
0,Works exactly as described!
0,Great case.  Bought it for my iPhone 5c.  Love the color, easy to install.  Highly recommend it!
0,Item as described. Item arrived just before due date. Real easy to apply screen protector. I've ordered some screen protector for my other devices and I always had problems. Smudges can be seen. I just use a screen wipe and its fine. Its good for the price.
0,looks great, works great.
0,Great stuff- I do see some heating up but it does charge faster than the Apple adapter
0,This cable is great.  It charges my iPhone, iPad and iPad mini w/o any issues.  It's quite long and looks good in black.  A+
0,the color of this case is great. i wasn't expecting for it to be this bright but i was pleasantyl surprised
0,The product has met my expectations.
0,Very nice,
0,I like it, it does what I need it to do. Some features I am not too crazy about. For example, I wish I could touch any key to light up the display screen. That is just a preference. I am still learning other features of this phone. So far, I like it.
0,I bought two of these after my first one was stolen. These are excellent. Holds a big charge and will charge lots of things between charges. To make it work properly, I suggest you charge it up before using it. It may take several hours. Then use it some, and charge it again. After that, you should be good to go. I keep this in my laptop bag and I use it a lot. It will hold a charge for a long time, too.		If you travel in your car a lot, I would put one in your glove compartment in case you ever get stranded because you could charge a cell phone many times over with this monster.		It's a bit heavy, but for heavy power users, this thing can't be beat.
0,Does exactly what I need it to do. Light on battery use (phone and Keylink itself), good range, can use with the Motorola app to find keys and find phone as well using the Keylink to ping phone. Allows my phone to be unlocked when in range as the Keylink can be set as a "trusted device" on Android. Replaceable battery (I'm looking at you, Tile).		My only knock against it is that the volume could be louder when it's being pinged. It also does not have any community finder as Tile does, but with Tile I never had luck with that, so it's no big loss. I've also had a couple of random disconnects, but Bluetooth is always going to be a little wonky no matter what device it is.		Purchased directly through Motorola site.
0,I like the design. It stays in my ear if the cord gets pulled.  The buttons are where they belong.  People hear me fine, and I hear them fine.  What else can be said.  These were the reasons I wanted filled when I bought it.
0,LOVE IT - WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY!! - THANKS AMAZON!!
0,Happy
0,I have a GS7 edge and have been looking for the perfect case for it for a few weeks now. I have tried cases from Spigen and Speck to UAG and Otterbox and a bunch of no name cases in between. This particular case is a well made case. It doesn't have much flex to it, although there is some, it does not add much bulk at all to the phone and it leaves all ports available. Button presses on the phone with this case on it are generally not a problem. The reason why I am marking this down one star is the overall feel and rigidity of the case. My daily driver is a Otterbox symmetry and that has been the king of cases so far, I have yet to find anything that will take its place. When I got this case I put it on the phone and overall I liked it, I didn't love it. Compared to the Otterbox I just don't have as much confidence this will protect the phone as much as the symmetry will. Additionally I prefer the look and feel of the otterbox over this transparent case. It really comes down to personal preference. The case works and it works well, but it still wasn't enough for me to take the otterbox off and replace it with this go-forward. At the end of the day this case has been added to the pile of S7 Edge cases and I reverted back to the symmetry. If you like the look of this case then yes get it, if you want a more rugged look and feel go with the otterbox symmetry, they are very similar in price and offer similar protection.
0,Perfect
0,This was the easiest screen saver I ever installed. It's made of a thick material that will last a very long time. I'm pleased with the way my screen looks through the protector. I would buy more of them.
0,I love this . I just wish it had a kick stand. everything else is wonderful. protective, feels very nice and doesn't add an inch to the circumference  of the phone, like my other.
0,I love this especially if I'm on the go.
0,I LOVE this screen protector. It's definitely thick and strong...I can't even tell I have a glass screen protector. I've dropped my phone a few times, but nothing has happened....if something did, there's a lifetime warranty! Definitely purchase this and enjoy peace of mind.
0,This phone charger is probably the best thing I've ever bought. It is so convenient to be able to plug my phone in and be able to use it basically anywhere in my room.  I have had no problems with this charger
0,Nice quality and also very smooth
0,Just received my new phone and put the case on it right away. The case has a great feel and I like the way it feels in my hand. The kickstand is a great feature to have. So fat,  I love it.
0,Works as intended at a price that is competitive.  If you want eye catching fancy - look elsewhere.  It smears easily but also cleans up easy
0,Love this case fits perfect on my phone have dropped it a few times already and no damages at all phone is still working really good and keeps my phone protected from scratches and drops it comes with a screen protector built into the case so that's a plus
0,Seems to work well, no issues with anything.
0,Like everything from Anker,this works as advertised!  I love Anker!
0,Very nice case that shows off the phone nicely and provides some excellent protection. The internal colored rubber is a very creative design that I highly admire.
0,Love it!
0,it fits in samsung
0,Handiest item since sliced bread.  Why can't I invent something like this...simple, but brilliant.  (I guess I'm still lacking the second ingredient)
0,great case fits perfect
0,Product arrived as expected and worked as I hoped it would.
0,I love this leather swivel wallet It's lighter and comfortable when it hungs on my belt. It's really worth the money.
0,GREAT!!!!!
0,nice to look at but don't expect much protection from a fall or drop
0,Gorgeous stylus pens. Everyonealways asks where I got them.
0,May not be for everyone, but I like it. The case is very solid. The screen is well protected while leaving ample openings for on/off, volume, camera, speaker, S pen, earphone, and microUSB port. Heeding the warning from other users that the beltclip breaks off readily, I intentionally broke it off :) and put the rest of the holder/phone in my cargo pants. Not real fast getting the phone out, but with bluetooth so ubiquitous these days, there's less need for speed. The built-in stand is a little unstable in the 'portrait' position, but works fine in the 'landscape' position. It also works well with a dash (GPS) holder: i. Trek ME-USDM Universal Dashboard Mount, also from Amazon.
0,This is a set of protection screens for an iPhone 5S.  The package contains 3 screen protectors and a special sticky film that helps remove the final lint and dust on the phone screen before you apply the protective screen. There is also a set of basic instructions on installing the screen protectors.		The instructions to install the protectors are very clear and I basically cleaned my phone with a microfiber towel and then used the cleaning film and the screen of the phone was nice and clean.  I then installed the protector just like the instructions state.  The final job was pretty good with no bubbles and no ugly dust or lint under the protector.		The protector does not go all the way to the edges of the phone but my wife has several minimalist phone cases that slightly wrap around the front edges of the phone so I tried one of those cases and the film fit pretty well.  I always have a little trouble installing screen protectors to get them perfectly straight but I have seen so called professionals have the same problem. The iPhone 5S fingerprint reader worked fine after the installation.  The screen image of the retina screen is not as good with a screen protector and that is a tradeoff that you will have to decide on.  It was just OK after I installed the protector.  Is it better to protect your phone or have the screen uncovered and more likely to get scratched or damaged?  That is a personal decision that each phone owner has to make.		I don't always use screen protectors as many of my phone cases have had pre-installed protectors as part of the case.  This is a good protector and what I liked most was that selling price is fair.  I have seen some protectors that cost much more for one or two films and these have a reasonable price. They do show fingerprints but no worse than the screen protector on my OtterBox Defender case.  Based on the look and feel of the protector and the price I give these a 5 star review as a good buy.  They can protect your expensive iPhone 5 or 5S which increases your trade in value of your phone when you upgrade.		I received a sample product for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.
0,This is truly a wonderful phone. Even though it's an older model, it performs well and the battery life is as advertised!  I bought one for myself and one for my wife.  So far, no problems!
0,A OEM Blackberry battery and charger at this price.....no brainer
0,I bought this case for my wife a few days before the iPhone 6 launch. I had previously purchase the alixo for my iPhone 5 and loved it. The case and the phone showed up on the same day.		The primary reason why I opted for this case is because it is clear AND has the screen protector integrated. My wife bought the gold iPhone and didn't want to hide it behind a case. The screen protector has a button cover integrated with it that works win the TouchID. After having lemonade spilled by my 2 year old on her last one, that was a key feature that she requested.		The fit of this Alixo case over the iPhone 5 version is that the fit seems slightly looser, which isn't a bad thing.  It was difficult getting all the seals to seat properly on the last version, but this one is easier.		Although I hope it is not a repeat occurrence, dropping the phone from about 3 feet onto tile didn't do anything to the phone.		I'm not that brand loyal, but New Trent products are great and I will continue buying their products on all my new devices.
0,The colors are bold and look awesome together	easy to put on and take off the phone	very durable	shipping was fast and case was exactly as described	I would order this case again!
0,It is so cute and fits my phone perfectly! And it arrived right when they said it would :) I'm very excited about this case!
0,Bought this for my mom. She loved it. The item arrived promptly with no issues. I would definitely recommend buying this.
0,Looks basically new, no scratches or dings, with all accessories and in original box.  Activated on Sprint network easily.  So far so good!
0,Works very good
0,work as expected so far. Great to have the extra length over the 3ft cables.
0,As the first phone to run on the US 3G network (and in some areas even faster 3.5 G), I was wondering how well this would work as a modem for my laptop for accessing the internet.		Guess what? I'm using this regularly now to connect my macbook to the internet! I'm giving up my mobile aircard (which costs about $ 70 per month) and I'm just using my unlimited mobile internet. Another positive - no need to take out the usb aircard dongle and insert it into the side of the laptop each time I need to use it!		The connection is fast enough to download video and music (you tube etc. will work fine both on the phone and the tethered mac) but the phone gets hot when it's used as a modem. It also uses a lot of power so for long time use as a modem, I'd keep it plugged into the charger.		Joikuspot is the software I used ($ 25 for a perpetual license) to tether my phone to the macbook so I can use internet.		I'm happy that MS office comes built in. I'm able to import my financial worksheets (even big ones where I do financial modelling) and it still works fast.		Fring works well on these phone - much better than on the Nokia N95. With Fring and my Skype call-out account, I can carry on telephone conversations with almost as much clarity as using my skype on the laptop.  In the N95 (which is also a great cellphone), the processor isn't fast enough to allow phone conversations - the voice quality is so degraded that it's barely understandable. Apparently, Nokia placed a very powerful processor in this machine.		And since it has a fast processor, all the applications open almost instantly and my cousin, a Blackberry curve user was so impressed with the speed he said it's the next phone he'll get.		Another excellent software I like using with this phone is my Salling Clicker. I use it for remotely controlling itunes in my laptop (like when there's a party and I was to change albums or artists from my phone) or clicking to the next slide in my powerpoint presentation or fast forwarding my DVD player to the next chapter.		This is a lot of technology for the money and I highly recommend it to everyone!
0,When I mean easy - I mean EASY! No joke. Some of these screen protectors can be a pain in the behind to put on but the seller provides you with the perfect tools to make this happen gracefully.
0,good product
0,Perfect fit, feels nice in hands.
0,Did job and was very pleased
0,Very useful at a great price!! A must have for all Iphone users, It comes in handy. Good size and sturdy
0,I love it, but it does bubble a bit. I did everything they told me to do, but it still bubbled.
0,excelente
0,1. I have dropped my phone many times and there was no damage due to this case.		2. The protective one piece rubber helps in the event of spills.		3. This is highly durable.  My other cases have failed, but this one is indestructible.		HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
0,Fixed my Galaxy Tab 3 quickly and easily. I've been using it with the new screen for a few months now and it works just like it did the first day I bought it. The hardest part about fixing your screen is removing the old glass, other than that it is a cake walk! If you are unsure of what you are doing just look up a tutorial on youtube and you will be able to replace your screen like a pro.
0,Great phone case, it's a good fit, but one part broke after a few weeks
0,This quick charge charger is awesome! It charges my Samsung S3 super fast! The charger is well made and should hold up well over time. I love that the plug folds in for compact and easy travel as to not bend or stab other items that are in your bag. Please note that this does not come with a lightening cable you will need to purchase that separately. Highly recommend this product. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review is based solely on my experience with this product and not influenced in any matter by receiving a discount.
0,Works as advertised. I have a total of 5 iDevices in my household and was tired of charging one device at a time or use multiple power outlets. This one just did the trick. I now have 4 lightning cables permanently plugged into it and the power outlet is also being used to power the base station of my wireless IP Phone. I have charged 2 iPhone 6s Plus and one iPad mini all at once with this, and they all charged correctly and toolk normal amount of time to fully charge upto a 100%.		The only thing I am a little worried about is that it probably doesn't have surge protection. I realized that there are other similar options available with surge protector inbuilt only after purchasing this but we will see how it holds up. Hopefully it doesn't fry my devices or burn down my home.
0,I've used this style on for of my last phones.  It's great protection without being overly bulky. This case got me to switch from Otterbox and not look back.
0,Very protective and stylish case.  Thank you!
0,I was torn between this and the Astro mini (2600 mAh) due to the size, but I'm very glad I got this.  It came in very handy at a wedding yesterday, allowing myself and 3 others to get some charge so that our phones would have juice the rest of the night.  It charges my Nexus 4 (has a 2100 mAh) battery fully twice, at a very rapid rate may I add!  It comes with necessary adapters for many different charging devices, even a mesh carry along pouch comes with it.  It takes about 8 hours to charge the entire thing.  It's roughly the size of 3 stacked gram crackers (after you've broken them).		The only thing it doesn't come with is something to actually charge the device, which is okay because I just used my phone charger.
0,I does the job very well.
0,Very nice quality case! Very classy and elegant look. Purchased as a gift and now I wish there was one for my phone!
0,I always buy these Screen protectors when I buy a new phone. They work great and last a long time. I definitely recommend these all the time to my friends and family.
0,Works good thru an otterbox but does not fit lifeproof
0,Absolutely can not speak highly enough of this product and seller. Great product - very durable. Connectors are beefy and wire had thick coating that holds up well. Fantastic customer service. I will be purchasing their cables exclusively in the future.
0,This was purchased as a gift. The recipient loves it. It's still in use, which is saying a lot for this person.
0,This helps with the excessive scratching endured during the life of my phone.  I've had it for almost two years and it looks new.  Buy it and you will like it.
0,Works Very Well...No interferance with the touchscreen
0,I ordered 3 phone cases at once trying to get one that I liked.  This one is my favorite of the three. I fits my IPhone with a case on it, but is not so big that it rattles around. It is just what I wanted.
0,Exceeded my expectations and came quickly.  Seller was attentive and made sure buying process went smoothly.  Never owned a fish or micro lens and so far on first outing was so amazed at the shots I got.  Example took a picture of a dead stump with micro zoomed in saw a spider without the lens could hardly find it and no I'm not blind had corrective surgery so my eye sight is 20/20 and was also to get excellent shots with the longer lens seemed shaky but viewed pics and they were perfect I had forgotten the tripod but will update after vacation so far I have used in the past a Kodak point and shoot and a canon t1i which is great but downside bulky.  Instead of buying another camera and spending potentially hundreds more opted to use phone camera and try the lenses at a highly reduced cost and was blown away at the pictures.  Keep in mind obviously not canon t1i level but definitely competitive with a point and shoot at a fraction of a cost of say samsung  smart camera I have a Samsung smart phone with a decent camera so why spend 4-500$ when I already did for s phone :) if your on the fence and you don't like lugging around a camera but still want to capture nature I suggest getting this kit it works wonders.
0,This battery is way better than the original. Stays charged longer. The only difference is that this battery does not have NFC. but if you don't use it like I don't then this battery if perfect.
0,Good fit, easy application. Time will tell if it survives my on my clumsy mother's phone, but so far, so good.
0,No complaints, does what it says, all ports work great.  The blue light is really cool. Wish I had bought one sooner.
0,This is a great product for anyone using personal mobile electronics such as Smartphones, Tablets etc.  It has saved me on trips where I was away from my auto or plug in charger.	I suggest this product with full 5 star rating.	Edit:	I forgot to add the laser pointer and LED light, they have come into play several times, a great addition to the perfect product.
0,I was hesitant to open this package when I received it; mainly because I botched up the application of a screen protector for my tablet; THIS item was very easy to apply.
0,These are easy to use and provide full screen protection for my son's Nextbook. Even has a hole that goes around the camera lens.
0,LG phones are the Bomb. I love this little phone so much. I can do what I want and don't have to worry about a big bulky phone.
0,Works great
0,nice
0,Just like the OEM back plate that originally came with the phone. Fits great and feels good too.
0,I've used many cases on many phones and can find no flaws with this one. Classy and durable and the total protection of having the screen covered when closed.		The only thing - with this type of case - you fold the cover back to use the phone and get the inside of the cover oily/greasy from your hands touching it over time, then when you close the case, that oil transfers to your screen - meaning whenever you open your case, you see a print of the inside of the case on your screen, in whatever nastiness your hands have transferred over time. No fault of the case, though - just something to be aware of! Still recommend!
0,It was hard to find a case that was both protective and nice looking! This case is very sturdy. Yet, it is still streamlined so I can fit it in my pocket. The black is ribbed, so it provides some gripping action when you are holding the phone. The pink is metallic. It also has bumps on it to provide gripping action. This is well worth every penny!
0,case is better than others I have purchased at higher cost.
0,Very slick case for the Stylo 2v. Thin and doesn't add bulge. Very stylish. However, there is needed room for improvement. The edge protector for the screen is miniscule, and with an added glass protector its virtually flush. The opening for the stylus is small and takes a small finger, finger nails or a bit of effort to get out.		Overall... Great case. We'll see how the protection is over time.
0,Best $20 i ever spent I have the Nexus 6 with a skin and a rugged protective case and my phone still charges with no problem i will never use micro usb charging again i love so much im gonna buy 3 more as Christmas gifts, it even shuts itself off when the phone is 100% charged its well worth $20
0,What a bargain!  The case is much better than the pictures reveal.  It's a well designed 2 piece.  The inner shell is an inner silicone sheath with a beautiful poly-carbonate shell.  The front part of the shell perfectly snaps in place.  No imperfections.  The poly-carbonate is finished to look like brushed aluminum.  It's rare that I find no flaws with a product.  This product is perfect.  You can spend $20 more for a case.  I doubt that you will find a better case for the $$$$$$.
0,Simple: it gets the job done well. Charges devices quickly. Comes with an Anker USB cable, which are some of the greatest out there.
0,Love It!
0,I dropped my phone a few times since I got this and it only got a very small Crack near the bottom where the button is, it took me a few days before I even noticed it was there but it did it's job. The phone is fine :). Note: this HAS to be put on perfect or the bottom button will not work properly, mine was just a little off and every now and again the button gets stuck another press and it comes right back up. The kit comes with sticker.....things to help placelebrate it properly so as long as your not real shaky you should be fine
0,I may be a tad premature on this review, but so far this unit is exceptional. It is light, small, but solid. I have read a couple of comments about the flip boom on the unit that turns it on or off and how it will hold up over time. If you are brutal with the unit, or any unit for that matter, than I can see practically anything breaking easily. Treat it delicately and it should last for a long time. It is very easy to pair, once you find the right fit for your ear with the provided insert gels and hooks, it will fit snugly and comfortably, I would imagine, for most people. I have tried a few different units here and there and I have concluded that several factors have to be taken into account. Your hearing, ear size, taste, needs, etc. will all come into play when selecting a Bluetooth headset. I am challenged hearing-wise a bit more so on my left ear than right. The bottom line for me is that this thing is loud, clear, there is no static on either end, music sounds magnificent, the Motospeak app can be advantageous, and bottom line it fits wonderfully all day in the ear. Sorry, I will never test it with a top down in a vehicle, ridiculous. I will never attempt to use it in a loud place, ridiculous. Just call back when in a more quieter environment. If you are looking for a solid, small, well designed, clear, loud, and reliable headset for every call you make and receive, than this purchase is a definite plus.
0,Nice, item, great price
0,Bought it for my HTC One about 3 months ago and I have to say it fits well and very stylish and also, very durable.
0,Exactly what I was looking for.  With the extended battery the S4 is a brick, and sometimes a bit hard to hold.  Not only does this negligible-weight cover protect from scratches, and protect what really is a cheap plastic back cover, but it provides a nice textured surface that does not slip.  Better, it lips out over the front.  Several have pointed out that this means that when you place the phone down face down, that it rests on the lip so that the screen doesn't touch the table.  But, it also means that there is a purchase for your fingers.  I find that one of the only drawbacks of the S4 (who thought I would ever complain about a larger screen?) is that the entire front is a screen, so it is easy while holding it to touch something and send it off on an adventure.  It is a bit easier to hold without doing this with the lip.
0,Quad Lock is far and away the best option I have found for using my phone while running! The phone is front and center and the lock holds it in place -- even when I run into things! The case is protective. I also love that the same attachment can be used in your car, for biking, at home etc. My arms are large and the wrap was slightly tight but still workable. If you have large arms, you may want to find another option if tightness will be uncomfortable for you.		If you are looking for a good running option, seriously, look no further than the Quad Lock -- I have been using mine with previous versions of my phone for over 2 years and have no issues what so ever!
0,This one didn't do it for me.
0,Great for a while but no phone case is built to last.
0,Used this on my brand new iphone 6 plus and once I dropped it, the screen protector slightly chipped and shattered at the corners. Thankfully my screen didn't break! But I recommend buying two packs of these, unless you can stand having a cracked screen protector for some time.
0,Very attractive, but it still didn't feel like it would withstand damage from falling on the ground.
0,okay
0,Good cables
0,A solid 5 Stars!		I've been a fan of Spigen since 2013 when I got my 5s, and even bought cases for my daughter's Galaxy S4.  Their Tough Armor, Slim Armor and Neo Hybrid cases were minimalist in design yet offered sufficient protection under almost all circumstances.		However, I've been a little disappointed with the slippery feel of their Neo Hybrid case for the 6 Plus, so much so that I've returned it.  Along with the Neo Hybrid case, I purchased this Air Cushion and a Tough Armor, and right now, I like the Air Cushion the best.  Clearly the TA will offer more protection, but the AC has a very grippy feel while in hand.  The AC also shows off the iPhone's design and adds very minimal size to the phone itself. The ports line up and are slightly over-sized, the buttons also line up and allow easy and accurate operation.		This is the Clear case without any colored bezel, so I can't speak to some of the criticisms I've seen in regards to the shade of color or the staining of the edges.		Only time will tell how well the case will hold up, but I do not anticipate any problems.  I will update as time goes by.
0,I bought this little magic machine with the intention of taking it to Disney World. Let me tell you, it worked wonders. It charged my and my husband's cell phone multiple times. We were never without our mobile devices. Absolutely handy!
0,Headset works great, issue is the apps available for it suck. If there were good quality apps then the head set would function perfectly. Does no good to have a fully functional VR headset with nothing to use it with.
0,The Akcord Magnetic holder is one of the best devices I have for my phone in a long time! I have a Prius, and even with the beveled dash, the suction cup works wonderfully. That along is a keeper. My iPhone 6+ -- the big guy -- fits perfect.		Pro:	Sturdy and steady mounting.	Easy to move around.	Keeps the phone in reach	Keeps the phone safe	Magnetic mount is awesome	Secure phone is seconds		Con:	You'll have to get used to the suction cup. I find when not in use to loosen then re-attach the best way to keep the phone secure. Not really a con -- but something you'll have to get used to.		In all, another fine Akcord product, one that is inexpensive. This is the third product I have received from Akcord and I am very satisfied.
0,PROS:	- Slick case which attaches seamlessly to your phone and blends in so nicely that you can't even tell it's on.	- Back has bad-ass dark metal section that looks way sexy.	- Edges are a few millimeters above the screen but almost invisible.	- Back of the case levels out the protruding camera, so it never touches the surface.	- The material has grip.		CONS:	- Buttons are a bit hard to get to; takes a bit getting used to.		CONCLUSION:	If you're looking for a case that does not double the size of your phoneessentially turning into a 1980's brickthen this is the case for you. It will not fall out of your hand and to to honest makes the black S6 look even better. If they shave the material off the button areas a bit more this would be a 5 star rating.
0,best case for note 4.  should make for every phone.
0,Finally a cable for me! I was so tired of the 3ft cable not reaching across my bed and found this one. It works completely fine with my 6s and the braided makes this thing tough!
0,Just the right thickness. The feel is smooth but grippy. The buttons work well and the port cutouts are exactly the right size. This case is typical fine Spigen quality.
0,THIS MAKE YOUR PRODUCT LOOK ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
0,This really came in handy on a recent trip. There was 2 of us in a room and the outlets weren't exactly easy accessible. I do keep this in my living room so everyone can recharge in one area without cords plugged in everywhere. I really like the little lights. They turn off when that gadget is done charging.
0,I think is the only one that doesn't required to have another case on the phone in order to fit! This is very nice and slim. I hate carrying my phone with a brick as a protector!
0,This was my husbands favorite thing ever. He was excited to be able to charge his personal and work phone at the same time. The charger charges at a decent time. It's not bulky which is a plus. Very dependable and convenient to have. I did receive this product for free in exchange of my honest and non biased review.
0,This product is great!!! My phone is the sony Xperia Z3V which has sealed ports due to its waterproof capability. Because of this anyone who owns this phone can likely agree it can be a pain to open the ports for traditional charging. That all ended when I purchased this Yootech Qi wireless charger. The phone sits pretty centered on the pad and charges with no problem. The rubber pad keeps the phone from sliding around. I was skeptical at first as I've never owned a wireless charger but this charger is phenomenal. It charges impressively fast and I've had no heating issues or anything like that. The charger does not come with a base to plug the usb cable into however I used my original phone charger base and it works just fine. I did read reviews warning that you must use the right size base and I believe most original phone charging bases should be just fine, as long as its not one of the really small bases typically found at Walgreens or CVS. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a wireless charger at a great price.
0,So much fun for a great price! I use this with my Motorola Razr Maxx. I don't get all the snazzy new features, but it works well enough for me. My first VR experience was with the Star Wars app and I was having so much fun crashing around to play.
0,good
0,This is a great screen protector for a great price!  I did experience some chipping on the edges of the after I accidentally dropped my phone but my screen on my iPhone was not impacted or damaged at all.  I love that Maxboost offers a lifetime warranty on this item because screen protectors do need to be replaced often.  I contacted Maxboost for a new screen protector and it was a no hassle experience.  They mailed a new one to me immediately.  I would highly recommend this screen protector to anyone who owns an iPhone 6+.
0,I bought this as a daily special, it didn't cost much over ten bucks. It's fairly nicely made out of hard plastic and works to charge my iPhone and my iPad. But I haven't figured out exactly how to get it to solar charge EVERY time. The manual is in broken english and is not much help. But it's still a good charger for the money. It charges from electricity just fine. I'll be glad when I figure it all out 100%. I am not sorry I bought it.
0,Can't say enough good things about this case! I priced the exact same one in the mall and it was $60.  I was able to purchase this one from Amazon for a fraction of the cost!  My teenage daughter liked it so well she took it from me and put it on her phone and all her friends have raved about how cool it is.  I don't have to worry that she will break her new iPhone because it's safely and securely tucked away in this wonderful case!
0,worked well.. did the job. Solid build quality :-)
0,It works, however you do have to put the phone in just the right spot. Also I would have given it five stars instead if only the charging were faster, 2A. This charges at 1 AMP, but there are very few wireless chargers on the market that charge faster at more than 1 AMP.

0,This battery is just like if not better than the original.  I have not had any problems with it and it is holding a charge.  No problems with this item.  I would buy it again if needed.
0,Love it
0,its ok, the kickstand is pretty handy for watching videos.
0,This iPhone charger skin is so freaking adorable. Our baby girls room is decked out in Winnie the Pooh and this is a perfect complement to plug in our phone when we are in her room listening to lullabies.  It also comes with stickers of all of your favorite characters from Hundred Acre Wood!  Cannot comment enough on how cute this is, love it!  While I have received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, my opinion is my own and is not for sale.
0,Well made, seems to support quick charging despite the length of the cable.
0,todo bien excelente vendedor me llego lo solicitado y en perfectas condiciones.
0,I purchased this item for a family member. She is totally happy with it.
0,Good
0,Excellent product a must have for any I phone user. Tries others and nothing stands up to the commuter series case
0,Reorder, had to get a new phone so I had to get another magnet
0,This is fantastic.  My windshield mounts always fall off. It might be because my windshield is so steeply raked, things are hanging down almost vertically.  Anyway, the genius of this design is that the rod acts like a lever, and the thing that sits on the dash is like a fulcrum.  So the weight of the phone pushing down on one end of the rod, pushes the suction cup at the other end of the rod, up against the window.  It can never fall off!		The rod is slightly flexible, but it won't bend under the weight of the phone.  The thing on the dash doesn't need suction, the weight of the rod pressing down on it holds it in place.  I love this, after so many years of having to lose a cup holder, or the CD loading door, or having something swivel on a vent, or having it be too low (in the charger hole at the bottom of the dash), FINALLY I can have my cell phone exactly where I need it to use it for GPS, and it stays put.
0,it is what it says on here, it makes it look like a mirror. the only bad thing about it is that it STILL reflects everything while the screen is on and it makes it nearly impossible to see whats on your screen. even when you have the screen brightness on all the way.
0,Very Very Very easy to apply this product - so much easier than applying the flimsy ones.  Does not interfere with the cases.  Let's hope it holds up!
0,Snug fit, superb quality, excellent protection. I recommend it.
0,had the case for about 2 months, it's still holding up pretty well. The fit and finish is not the greatest; the white plastic case under the "rubberized" black shows around the edges where they snap together.	Right now, it's off because I thought that it was not letting my phone dissipate heat, like I have read from other posters. But, I do not think the case is making the phone warm.	No frill, no thrill.
0,Good solution so far but be aware of where your phone will sit in relation to your shifter.  Just about anytime I put it in park I know my phone down.  I probably need to use the outside plate to mount it more securely.
0,Nice finish, but mars easily...
0,I bought this for my boss.  She loves it and has had no problems with it.  The only thing she didn't like was the fact that it was matte, not shiny.
0,Kids love selfie stick...Great for family pics....Received a promo code for a review!!!!
0,This is a really great case. It locks securely in place so that you do not have to worry about your phone coming out if you were to drop it for any reason. The case came in great packaging. It is great that the case is see through in that way you get to still see the beauty of the device. With the screen protector on the front it is very responsive, you do not have to press on the screen hard to get it to do simple tasks. You are able to clean the case easily when you notice smudges or anything else on it.
0,This is a pretty excellent all weather case.  Because it is all weather, it is bulky. If you want to keep the sleek design of a naked iphone, this is not the case for you. But if you are a hiker or a person who puts a phone in peril, this is perfect.		The package recommends testing the case out for watertightness before you put your phone in it.  I did that, and it worked.  Submerged in water for quite a while and not a drop inside.  Once that test is done, install is simple. Just put your phone inside.		Case looks great, protects my iphone from everything, and even keeps water out.
0,Permitted me to use an old but comfortable 2.5mm mono cordless phone headset with a smartphone and a laptop.  Mic works, earpiece works, enough said.
0,The case and belt clip is exactly the way they described. Its hard plastic all black and sturdy. Now that I have the clip with a case I will never have to ask where my phone is. Anyone out there always losing your ohone like I do needs to order this product you won't be disappointed
0,This is a handsome case, designed to not only protect the iPhone 6s-Plus or iPhone 6-Plus, but also to serve as a wallet with room for cash, credit cards and identification.  An added plus is that the Amovo case allows the phone to be removed, because it has a detachable magnetic snap-on portion, so that when you're taking photos or using GPS, you needn't completely detach your phone from your wallet.  The phone portion is well designed, ensuring that all ports, buttons & cutouts are accessible.  It isn't "real" leather, however, but PU leather-- a thin layer of hide, usually the innermost, attached to a polyurethane surface.  It is an attractive material, but doesn't always wear well.		[Note: I received the case at no charge for the purpose of evaluation and honest review.]
0,Just what I needed and at a good price.
0,Cannot use with case, but it holds the phone perfectly.  Kinda kills my GoPro because it allows for the camera to be used while mounted.  Good quality well done by ram
0,Decent, flexible case. solves the purpose. Works with a glass protector. Win!
0,Great back up to phones and other small electronics. I used this in camping and ski trips and it has been very handy and portable.	So far I haven't been able to drain the battery completely with use.
0,This a really good screen protector.  There isn't any like it for this device. Gives it the feel the Optimus needs with all the Protection described.  Shipping was fast and IT literally installs itself.  I laid it on the device and it stuck. No bubbles. No anything. Great Buy!
0,bought it from someone saying it was brand new, but the packaging had been opened and the item resealed in a bag, and it was missing the rubber flap over the charging port.  but the item worked and i still use it to this day 4 years later almost.  I use it to stream music from my phone to my radio and it will drop the FM transmission every so often, it has bricked on me a couple of times over the last few weeks but it has been well used and the reset button restores it nicely.  looking to probably buy another one shortly to replace it, the new versions don't have the buttons for controlling music like this one so ill stick with this one
0,This works great.
0,Case is great. Thank,you
0,My wife love it!
0,ALL OK
0,Ok, so I decided to buy a new phone to replace my old broken iphone 4. After the release of the iphone 6, I thought of buying it but the cost was too high for me so ,I decided to look the other way. After comparing the htc m8, z2, s5 , and the 5s, I went with Sony.	  The iPhone 5s 16gb was about the same price but no waterproof/ water resistance which was a big thing for me. Coming from a 32gb iphone 4 I could have not live with less hard disk space, and would have to spend almost $100 more for a 32gb 5s. We'll the androids have a memory card slot for adding as much as over 100gb of space which attracted my attention.	 I've choosed it over the HTC because I was not familiar with the brand and loved Sony all my life. Samsung on the other hand felt like a cheaply made product" it's popular where I live".	 Well with good reviews and a good history with me and sony I decided to get the z2 , it feels sturdy also kinda big, love the more control of the interface that I have on the android OS other than IOS and the great camera. Let's not forget the waterproof/dust proof capability.	 Not to bash at apple but they make great sturdy phones with an easy to use interface but the prices are just too high for their products. Another thing is that Sony just release it's z3 phone but my price range kept me to the z2 still an amazing phone.
0,Product  was exceptional, it just 5 star! Love It!
0,Ever since the very first Android HTC smart phone several years ago, Ive owned more phones than I can recall. Looking at a few recent phones, Ive owned Galaxy Note 3/4, Galaxy S 4/5, LG G2/3/4, Nokia 1520, Xperia Z Ultra, and my current daily driver, the Nexus 6. Im rather familiar with smartphones. :) So lets take that experience and see how the latest from Sony performs compared to the world of smartphones.		PROS:		+ Snappy 64-bit Snapdragon 650 SoC	+ Smooth Near-Stock Android User Interface	+ Dedicated 2-stage camera button	+ Expandable MicroSD Storage, up to 2TB (when available)	+ Standard 32GB Internal Storage (not 16GB!)	+ Fantastic 5 1080p IPS Display	+ Decent Battery Life	+ Fast Micro-USB Charge Capable	+ Forward Facing Stereo Speakers!	+ Excellent 13MP Front camera with crisp/sharp images	+ Virtually all LTE bands supported (GSM only)	+ Useful Xperia software included	+ Solid Build Quality & Feel	+ Factory Unlocked!	+ Good button placement and feel	+ Solid value while on-sale		CONS:		- Battery could be larger	- No Wireless Charging	- No Water resistance	- Sony bloatware which cant be removed	- Phone runs hot at times	- Rear camera location easy to block	- Wi-Fi speeds are only average	- List price a bit high		DESIGN		The Xperia X5 is a 5 phone with the usual Sony design aesthetics. Featuring squarish corners with a slight curve at the edges of the glass screen to make holding/swiping more comfortable. The backing is plastic, but doesnt feel cheap, and does an OK job of resisting fingerprints. Beyond that, there is the usual micro-USB port at the bottom, headphone jack at the top, and volume/power/camera button all on the right. Speaking of which, the power button is large and due to the shape/indention, is very easy to press. No more hitting volume buttons by mistake, or vise versa.		The single Nano-SIM and MicroSD tray is on the left. As an added bonus, you can actually remove it with your finger nails. On the front you have a very useful notification LED, which Ive missed more than expected on my Nexus 6. As well as my favorite feature, front facing stereo speakers. As with most Sony phones, they have a good high-end quality appearance and feel. But lean towards a more understated look. Nothing too flashy, in particular in black.		Sadly, the battery is not removable. Its a Sony, so no surprise there. What is surprising is that this design is NOT water resistant. You have to step up to the much pricier Premium variant for that.		OS & FEATURES		Having had Sony phones and tablets before, everything felt very familiar. And coming from a stock android 6.0.1 phone, everything is very natural and easy to find. The menus are all where they should be with many small, yet noticeable, Sony tweaks here and there. Such as making the main Settings menu and app drawer easier to navigate. I keep finding nice touches here and there as I explore the UI.		One noteworthy feature is the addition of Themes, which are accessible with the Widgets & Wallpaper settings. Sony also has their STAMINA mode which adds considerable battery life to the phone. Its similar to what Google has recently added to Marshmallow in that it disables extra functionality and features to really stretch out runtime.		Sadly, there is a bit of bloatware in the form of Sony & 3rd party apps, which you generally cant remove. Once disabled/hidden, its easy enough to pretend its not there. I just wish you could remove them.		While Im a big fan of 100% stock Android and faster updates, Ill gladly take the extras if basic performance & functionality doesnt take a hit. Which is exactly the case here. There's enough usable and practical features that I like to make it worth it. As noted, at the time of this review, Sony has the latest and greatest 6.0.1 Android OS.		PERFORMANCE		Stutter and lag are some of the most annoying things in a phone. Ive sold phones for this reason in the past. As noted in the OS section above, the user interface runs great. While the Snapdragon 650 isn't the latest 800 series you typically see in flagship devices, it seems to handle most tasks just fine.		Im not big on synthetic benchmarks for phones these days, but I do still feel they hold at least some value as another data point for comparison.		AnTuTu Benchmark v6.1.4 - 77028	Geekbench 3:	  Single-Core - 1404	  Multi-Core - 3803	Quadrant Standard - 29402	3DMARK:	  Sling Shot using ES 3.1 - 873	Vellamo Mobile Benchmark 3.2:	  Browser - 4673	  Metal - 2392	  Multicore (beta) -  2429		These look pretty good, with GPU-related scores tending to being the lowest. Although keep in mind a bunch of numbers mean nothing if real-world performance suffers. Swiping, pinching, opening/closing apps, are all nice and smooth. Right on-par with my stock Google Nexus 6. The only time I noticed a bit of sluggishness is when updates, downloads, or other similar task were running in the background		Gaming is always a good example of real-world performance. Its the primary task most folks are going to do that really pushes the CPU. I played several games including SimCity, Anomaly KR, Asphalt 8, and many others. SimCity had a bit more stuttering than Id like, although Ive seen this on other high-end devices. The others ran just fine and looked great; no indication that details were being lowered. This is partly due to only having to run at 1080p. More on that later.		Do note that if pushed, the phone does get a bit warm. In particular when going through the initial setup, downloading a bunch of apps, etc. That seems to be the norm with the latest high-end chips. The camera did once note that it was disabling some features due to heat. That hasn't happened again, and overall, a minor issue.		DISPLAY		After having used so many OLED displays, its often difficult going back to a normal IPS LCD. However, the 5 1080p IPS Display on the Xperia X looks excellent. In fact, right next to my OLED Nexus 6 and Galaxy S5, the Sony puts them to shame. Solid black levels (if not quite OLED), sharp images, great viewing angles, no light bleed, etc. Colors can appear a tad over saturated at the higher brightness levels, but there are display adjustments for that. Honestly, its just a nice screen to look at it.		With many cheaper IPS panels, you really do notice lesser screen quality and poor black levels compared to the newer IPS/OLED displays. Not so here. Yes, even with only 1080p resolution. On this 5 panel, nobody is going to miss those pixels unless you have it right in front of you face. Sony has always been commended and known for good quality IPS panels, and they continue to raise the bar. Color temperature is fairly well balanced, with whites appearing neutral. Theres also a white balance option if you prefer something a bit different.		Auto brightness was disabled by default, which is how I usually like it. I turned it on to see how it worked, and it did so well, Ive been leaving it enabled. Mostly due to the adjustment slide which determines how aggressive it kicks in.		CAMERA		Sony has always been known for making excellent cameras sensors that other manufactures use. Even though historically, the overall camera solution has been hit or miss on their own phones. Usually blamed on the software side of things. The 13MP camera with 22mm wide-angle lense works quite well here. Its wide enough to capture much more of the scene while not having any fishbowl effect. Especially when compared to traditional camera lenses. Now I find the camera on my other phones inadequate in this regard.		I won't go into all of the extra camera features. If youve used a modern smartphone, it's got those features, plus a few fun Sony features to keep things interesting. Including a separate AR app that adds special effects and themes to your pictures. But lets face it, other than the occasional panoramic shot, most of us are going to stick with automatic. Which we compared in multiple side-by-side pictures from our other phones. And it works great, regardless of shooting conditions.		Unfortunately there is no Optical Image Stabilization, but the software stabilization seems to work pretty well, if not quite OIS levels. There weren't many issues capturing indoor shots of my super active kids running around. Which is made even easier with the external camera button thats always there, ready to open the camera app, quickly focus, and take that quick shot.		My biggest gripe is that the camera sensor is pushed way in the corner, making it very easy for your finger to block. So expect to break some habits if your finger naturally gravitates to that area.		Same goes for the front camera. Its at the edge, which I also found myself coverup for those selfie shots. Which by the way, look far better than many rear facing cameras. Its actually pretty darn good in any situation not requiring a flash.		BATTERY		This is one of those features that seems to be at the bottom of the list for phone manufactures who are more interested in making phones as thin as physically possible. However, the 2620mAh battery combined with some helpful software improvements means youll likely get better than average battery life, as I did.		In my use, I was easily seeing 4+ hours screen-on time, and could easily last an entire day with moderate usage. Thats a little over half brightness, watching videos, surfing, a game here and there, all radios enabled, etc. Your mileage will absolutely vary. And even with that said, I do still wish the battery was a tad larger. As with most phones, if you decide to really push it, such as high brightness, lots of screen-on time, a high-end game running, youll still be looking for a charger by dinner time.		As expected, you do have fast charging at your disposal. I just prefer to avoid the cord until bed time. Less aggressive users should do just fine, however. Even I was using the phone much more than usual just to stress test it and see how the battery fares. The relatively smaller screen size combined with fewer pixels to push do help a lot.		Im probably just being picky, but I love big batteries. And its still noticeably better than the Galaxy S5/6 and Nexus 6. And lets not dismiss fast charging too quickly, as it is present, and works quite well to top off the battery in no time at all. Just don't expect wireless charging here.		SOUND		There are two speakers, and they're on the front. You know, right where they should be. Fortunately Sony continues to avoid common industry trends to shove speakers on the back/bottom where they are easily blocked. This placement is perfect for watching youtube and playing games.		With that said, the speakers could sound better. Even though total volume isn't an issue, it can sound a bit tiny, and doesnt have as much depth as I would like. At least youve got good stereo separation and still sounds decent. Ill take this over a higher quality rear-facing speaker any day.		NETWORK/CARRIER USAGE		I have AT&T and T-Mobile SIMs which are used in many other phones I have laying around. As in typical Sony fashion, these phones are factory unlocked and have virtually all of the LTE bands you could want for a GSM carrier. Sorry, no CDMA support here (i.e. No Verizon/Sprint).		Supporting all of the latest and greatest bands is key in ensuring youve got full coverage for your carrier, regardless of geographical location. Meaning Ive got lots of bars and excellent transfer rates for both carriers; right on par with my other carrier branded devices.		For some reason Wi-Fi wasn't quite as speedy as expected, only hitting around 200 Mbps max on my 802.11n 5Ghz band, if not slower at times. That was about 10 feet away from the router, in another room. From the same location, my Nexus 6 and Galaxy Tab S2 hit over 350-400 Mbps, which is pretty close to the max potential for this Wi-Fi router; and where notebooks tend to be at as well.		Perhaps Sony doesnt like my Netgear AC1750 access point; in which case its on its own since everything else loves it. If you do a ton of transfers over wi-fi, that may be an issue. Otherwise, a minor, but notable test result.		CONCLUSION		If this phone had a larger battery and was water resistant, it would be nearly perfect in my mind. But Im afraid no phone is. So I simply look for one that has most of the important stuff covered. And I have to say, the Sony Xperia X gets surprisingly close. The biggest hit is the missing water resistance (a staple of many Sony gadgets), which I feel should be included at the list price.		And the other cons? Well, lets face it, they're few and relatively minor. In fact, if the screen were larger, it could easily replace the N6 as a my daily driver. For now, it will be my #2 phone, which joins many phones I keep around. I use various phones for different purposes (work/personal/burner/testing).		Overall, if you can find it below list price (as it is now), I consider this phone recommended for those in the market for a 5 near-high-end smartphone that can pretty much do it all. 4.3 stars.
0,excelente
0,It's exactly as described and holds my Samsung Note 4 securely in a Samsung flip view case. Having to use the rubber "band" elastic holder is a bit of a pain, but the trade off is that by being a universal holder I won't have to keep changing it every time I get a new phone. By providing three inserts they've made it more likely that this unit will fit most size handlebars.
0,I really like this case it does what it's supposed to do hold credit card to hold some cash bills I love the magnetic that you can remove the phone at will I wish they came in more colors so I could match one with all my purses
0,I received this arm case and had to try it out! The strap is very comfortable, and fit my phone well. If you have a heavy case on your phone, theres a potential that it may be a tight fit. The key slot is becoming a pretty standard option on these cases, but the bonus was the card holder on the back. What a great way to go for a run/bike ride/roller blade. And have everything you need right there on your arm. Comfortably!		I rely on amazon for reviews of nearly everything before I buy. I like to give back to the community by reviewing items myself. My reviews are always honest and accurate to my experience, with that in mind, this item was sent to me for a discount in exchange for an honest review. I have thoroughly tested it and my reviews are always 100% honest and are not affected by the discount given.
0,great product fast turnaround
0,Looks like the original screen, works like a charm, and very easy to install. I would recommend it to all, even if you don't know a lot about installing/replacing phone LCD.
0,It's light weight and powerful fast charge! I just hope samsung will come out with much higher mAh fast charge.
0,Awesome fitment. Works great!
0,Fits snug, built well, feels good to the touch.
0,I love it, just wish it were a little more tacky in my hand.  However it is not slick like several other cases
0,* Disclaimer: case does not come with back card holder, I attached that myself.*		This case is incredible, and offers absolutely amazing protection! I am extremely paranoid about my iPhone and protecting its screen, so I am ways make sure to have a tempered glass screen protector on it. However, with this case, I feel that it protects it enough to where I don't have to worry about using a screen protector, and better yet, not have to constantly be spending money on buying replacement screen protectors, since naturally, being of tempered glass material, they tend to break very easily on contact!!!!		Here are some of the features that I have really enjoyed about my case:		[Pros]	- gorgeous two tone color. The light blue and grey, gives it a very warm feel and I love the way it looks on my gold iPhone 6!	- not only does it look great, it offers incredible protection! The inner shell (and part that wraps around the actual phone)	- soft, yet durable coating makes the case look and feel amazing while still offering that added protection.	- the cutouts are perfect and fit my standard iPhone charger cable perfectly without me having to deal with the annoyance of constantly having to remove the case.	- the volume cutouts are awesome because they are raised so it makes it much easier to raise and lower the volume		[cons]	- none that I have experienced so far		Overall, this is the perfect case for someone looking for optimal protection for heir iPhone, while still keeping the minimalistic feel and not having to sacrifice aesthetics to protect your phone! I would absolutely recommend this case, it has easily become one of my favorites for my iPhone 6!
0,great case for your phone
0,I was provided a URPOWER 3000mAh Power Bank free for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.		What You Should Know Before You Buy:	 Small, lipstick style power bank with a 3000mAh capacity.	 Square shaped with rounded edges that makes it steady on a flat surface.	 Has a single 1 Amp charging port for charging primarily phones, but it did register as charging on my iPad Mini.	 Enough capacity to charge a phone once or to add a little bit of charge to an iPad Mini.	 Great charging speeds as compared to competing power banks. Added about 20% in 20 Minutes to my iPhone 6.	 Compact and easily fits into a pocket or purse for emergency power on the go.	 Simple operation with no buttons. Just two ports for charging the power bank and a device and a single LED indicator light. No LED power gauge.	 A Micro USB charging cable is included in the package for charging the power bank or a Micro USB device.	 Has a small loop on one end that looks like it is made to hold a wrist strap, but there isn't one included in the package.		Conclusion:	Overall, this is a nice little power bank. It has a basic rectangular build with curved edges so it doesn't roll away has and some branding and information written on it.  It has the capacity to charge a phone just about once or extend the use of an iPad Mini a little bit. I tested it by charging my iPhone 6 and it added 10% charge in the first 10 minutes and another 10% in the second 10 minutes, which is a great result and on the top end of iPhone 6 charging speeds. I also gave it a try with my iPad Mini, and it did register as charging, but doesn't have the capacity to add too much. With this product, you get some extra juice in a very compact battery that easily fits in a purse or pocket. If you are looking for a compact power bank, this one is worth a look.
0,This charger lives up to expectations when it comes to charging speed when it comes to charging devices, however, there is one shortcoming when it comes to actually charging the bank itself.  It takes forever...  This charger does claim to support an unofficial version of quick charge 2.0 on the input, but testing this (at least with Samsungs adaptive fast charger) seem to show that it does not support it, or may charge slower with it (irony).  I did record it requesting 9 volts from the charger and it seemed to be charging with quick charge, but checking back on it a day later shows it made little to no progress with the charge.  I then plugged it into a normal 5 volt 2 amp port and it finished charging by the end of the day.  I returned my first unit because I thought it broke when it turns out that the Samsung fast chargers might be the issue.		Pros:	- Great build quality	- Quick charger 2.0 port works great even when another both ports are being used.	- Thin design (might fit in a pocket)	- Great capacity / size ratio		Cons:	- Horrible charging / no charging with Samsung's adaptive fast charge adapter.	- Huge capacity = long charge time	- Only three light states to let you know to battery charge state.		Suggestions:	- Support official Qualcomm quick charge on all of you high capacity and quick charge power banks.	- There needs to be a better what to tell how much battery power I got left, right now there are only three colors...		I was able to write this review thanks to Aukey generously shipping me a replacement charger for free.  Thank you Aukey, your customer service is greatly appreciated.
0,If you are looking for a travel bag to your apple watch this will work to avoid scratches to it. However it is not a hard case.
0,Just what I needed.
0,It was as advertised.  Does what I want it to do.  It arrived on time.
0,Arrived as expected
0,I really like the material of this armband. It is a very soft material. Therefore it is really comfortable on. The armband doesn't have any stitching so that seems to help with the comfort. The strap has wholes which seems to make it cooler. The arm band is narrower then some of my past which is great. The less amount of arm covered the better. It has two slots that you can use to wear. Either can be used for upper arm placement depending on your arm size. I actually wear my phone just above the wrist. I find this placement works fine for lifting and treadmill. I just use the smaller slot and it adjusts well to give a tight fit. It is comfortable for the hour I wear it and handles sweat well. It pretty much only fits your iPhone 6. Really any case will need to be taken off to get it in easily. The touch screen works just fine with the arm band on. I am thrilled at this. It does have two openings on the top and bottom for any cords you may use. I am a fan of the card holder on the back of the armband. I sometimes go for walks and pick up some small grocery items. I can carry my id and credit card to make my purchases. Nice feature as you can put your gym membership card in this slot also. It does have a key holder slot. I don't utilize this feature. A really cool feature on this arm band is the head phone holder. I lose my head phones way to often. This keeps them ready to work out at all times. Will be a feature I will look for always now. The reflection material on this is great for safety. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. I am not required to only provide positive feedback.
0,I use this case when traveling and doing more adventurous outdoor activities, as it's more protective than my normal Nexus case. It's not the most attractive thing in the world (though by no means ugly!), but it's inexpensive and does its job well. People complaining about the bump on the colored portion of the case are referring to a ~1mm difference in height, which should not be a problem unless you lay your phone flat on a surface for the majority of its use.
0,I still use this charger and I purchased it 2 years ago very durable and highly recommended	Original charger as well
0,Case was EXACTLY as I expected. Does not look cheaply made at all, in fact the Hello Kitty is actually heavy (not really heavy, just not cheap & flimsy).  Awesome steal for the price!!
0,Love this!  Works as advertised and having a backup is great. Really recommend this
0,The screen protector was very easy to put on the phone.  I have always had a problem with the plastic screen protectors, but this one was much easier to put on the screen and I did not encounter any problems.  I would definitely recommend this screen protector for your Galaxy S6.
0,This is a very nice case that protected my dad's iPhone when he dropped it. The case broke, but we like it so much we got another one.
0,Great product!  Works very nice!  Great shipping service also!
0,This review compares the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Otterbox-Defender/dp/B01MDLGEFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Otterbox Defender</a>&nbsp;series case and the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OtterBox-Cummuter/dp/B01M3P3J2T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OtterBox Cummuter</a>&nbsp;series case. Quick summary - the commuter series case is the one that remained on the Pixel XL while the defender is a little easier to install unmodified.		I'm posting this same review for both covers.		The reason that the commuter series case is the one being uses is that it isn't too much (neither is too little). It's just right. It is the right mix of security, size, comfort, and usefulness. The defender series case would be pretty much the same -if- the clear plastic screen cover were torn out and the clip/holder thing (the outmost piece) discarded. With those modifications, the main remiaing difference is that the commuter's outside piece is hard pastic while the defender's is soft plastic. My preference is hard plastic (commuter) because it slides in and out of my pocket easier. Someone else would prefer the defender because it doesn't slide out of a pocket as easily. Take your pick.		Another reason the commuter case is being used is that I don't want to modify the defender case by tearing out the screen cover and stuff. I want that thing ready for -heavy- duty. If I'm heading off to the woods or some kind of travel where bad things -will- happen, the defender series case, screen cover intact, is going onto the phone.		Both cases have an innermost piece that goes directly on the phone and an outermost piece that goes over both. The defender series has an easy to remove third piece that clips over the rest, it's kind of a holster.		It is not casual to put these protecters on the phone. Each has its own difficulties but the reality is that your going to push, pull, and nudge things until its right. It isn't hard, it just takes a little time and attention. Also - turn off the phone while you do this. Otherwise, you'll accidently launch apps, make calls, reconfigure your home screen, etc.		Installing cummuter series - mess with soft plastic piece until it's on right, then fiddle with hard plastic piece until it's on right.		Installing the defender series - mess with hard plastic piece until it's on right, then fiddle with soft plastic piece until it's on right. This is a bit easier than the commuter series because the hard plastic piece fits on the phone with little fuss.		Both cases make it harder to press buttons (on/off, volume), this is a good thing. The clear plastic screen cover of the defender makes it hard to use the touch screen, this is annoying in normal use, a blessing in more rugged and dynamic settings.		An unexpected nicety is that the ports for the finger print sensor and charge plug help guide you to the right position.
0,Great phone for the price my wife loves it!
0,I mainly use these with my phone at work to listen to music but I have also used them for making calls just so I don't have to hold the phone or put it on speaker phone.  People on the other end do say it sounds a little more distant than just talking directly into the phone and I'm not entirely sure where the mic(s) are to pick up my voice but other than that they work well and the sound quality is good.  It's nice how they fold up to store them without much space and connecting it to my phone for the first time was very easy so I had no issues using them or figuring things out.  They do kind of fall off my head if I look down rather easy sometimes since they are not super snug (I have a small head though).  I like how they look and feel and have no real complaints other than what others have said about not being able to hear me as well on the other end of the line though.
0,Awesome
0,As expected.
0,The phone is good, but not nearly as good as people make it out to be. I had an HTC before this and found it to have better App's and features than this phone. It does have some great qualities about it though. It is large, so unless you have an extremely large hand, you will need two to use it. The HTC is a little smaller and you are actually able to use it with one hand if need be. Battery life is minimal, so make sure to close running App's. Easy to do when you hold down the menu button and choose to close all running App's. Also, you will want to shut down all App's that you will never probably use and the phone will allow you to delete.
0,Perfect case to show off either the natural look of the nexus or any dbrand skin.
0,My phone dropped twice! Both times, I had this tempered glass on it, and it cracked the tempered glass instead of my phone screen. LIFESAVER!
0,Works very well & holds tight.
0,very good
0,I am very happy with these screen protectors. I just followed the instructions from TechMatte video and had a bubble free screen. The hinge method application really works. The cut outs on the screen protector were perfect for the Moto 3 and there was no problem with the edges interfering with the phone case. These are a 5 star quality screen protectors.
0,If it's the same 6p I got at best buy it's definitely worth the price. Finger print scanner works like magic. And the price is fair. After tax it was about the same as what I paid for mine.
0,Great Looking case slim and doesn't add much bulk!
0,Love it. Works great. I had zero bubbles and after 2 years I finally have a teeny scratch and chip over at the rounded corner opening by the mouthpiece, which I didn't even notice until I went to write this review. I'm not a phone dropper but I do put a steel lighter in the same pocket of my purse as my phone, so it could be from that.
0,This film is good, but it doesn't go all the way around the edge of the note 4. It's good, but I'd give a 5 if it the screen protector went all the way around the edge of the phone, otherwise, it's a good film
0,After recently purchasing a new Samsung Galaxy Note 3, i wanted a case that was economical and durable; this case has these features plus more, all for $12.99 Amazon Prime. I even received the package on a a Sunday, which i was ecstatic about. I will be letting my family and friends know about this product. Contrary to other cases being sold, this case is streamlined, quite thinner than most of the cases for this specific model and makes it easier to use for those of us with smaller hands as well as larger hands. A definite win win situation!!!!
0,So far I am very pleased with this Ringke Fusion.  It fits my iPhone 5 perfectly.  If it changes, as some have reported, I will update this review.
0,Great!
0,excellent
0,Awesome, just awesome. I've been camping in the Ozarks, in a valley and still gotten signal. Wide coverage range. Very durable unit as well. So far has worked well with a VPN too. Used this with many different machines, although only PC and Linux (ubuntu). If you have specific questions, please email me, I don't often check the comments/questions to my reviews (iancormac71@gmail.com).		Setting this mobile unit is as near to effortless as I've ever gotten with a network device.
0,I bought this due to I always travelling to Asia. And I do not need to switch my sim card and I just put my Malaysia and Vietnam sim card then I can use in both country. But the only thing you need to be aware is when you are in one country, make sure when you make a call, you are selecting the correct sim card to make it, otherwise you may use the Vietnam Sim in Malaysia and make the call in Malaysia. You will be killed by roaming charge.
0,Worked as expected
0,Have only used this charger a couple of times, but so far it has charged my phone without issues. Can happily say it is one of the car chargers that supports Quick Charge 3.0.
0,Durable, excellent price!
0,I have used this case on a few different phones and it works really great. I tend to drop my phone a lot and nothing is ever happened to it
0,I saw both Kate Spade cases in Sprint when I went in to turn in my note7. I'm going to test this and one other then update my review, but if her lifestyle brand is as stunning as her clothing, I'm sure I'll be satisfied!		Update:	Pleasantly surprised by the durability and compliments I get. Since my phone is gold, the dots stand out less than if a black phone, but the fit is great and works well with a screen protector - it is primarily glass!
0,This is a really great product.  It is very sturdy - easy to take anything off of the case that you do not care about.  For the price, you can't get one better than this anywhere.
0,This should have been included with the extended battery and back cover. Otherwise it's fantastic for added protection.
0,Works!!
0,Nokia Lumia 830 is a cell phone very pleasant to the touch, thin and light, but with this good guard change much even visual touch that feeling (mi Lumia is white and it is a color that stands out... with the design of the black lens that looks like an eye but with the guard, you lose that) but for my cellular integrity is first and as it is not known when foolishly you can fall from January 2016 I East cell to date March 2.017 95% of the time this does not have removed it with this protector, has edges by the side of the screen that time that is has fallen mouth down does not touch the floor and that is important, and combined with Skinomi TechSkin screen protector I have protected my Nokia Lumia 830.	By the way does not interrupt the charging wireless for nothing
0,I purchased this product for use with my new Google Nexus 7 2013, and I'm pleased with my purchase.  I also bought the Moko case, reviewed separately.  I was pleased to find that the Anker Wireless Charger charge my device with the Moko case on the unit.  A bonus, in my view.
0,Great!!!
0,Great product definitely will buy it again.
0,I love the clear design of this case, which allows me to see my phone in all its glory (I didn't buy it to hide it). The "dots" add a bit of character that I happen to like, but this might not be for everyone. I'm also a fan of the amount of protection this case offers to clumsy handed me.
0,Worked perfectly - just like the one that came with the phone.
0,Wife really likes this. She says its comfortable and looks awesome!!!
0,These are AMAZING! they are the perfect size and depth to hold 7-8 cards with ease and HIDE the cards contents. They even fit an RFID sleeve to protect your credit cards (IF) you decide to carry a credit card or cards that contain RFID sensitive chips. This is really perfect for someone like me who tends to simply throw their phone in their pocket and a wallet in another - I really hate to carry a purse. (I also have 5 herniated discs in my neck so carrying a purse is really a strain and not reccommended by my doctor). This allows me to carry my license, my debit card, my insurance card, my dogs service id  card and a few business cards.		Its also got an awesome screen cleaner and it works wonderfully at clearing away fingerprints, smudges and dirt. I couldn't ask for better. Well, yes I could, make them in other colors please like HOT PINK. Other than that. I am completely satisfied and in love. I may have gotten these at a discount, but I have actually gone back and bought more at full price because I LOVE them so much!		As a mother, grandmother and business owner, I know and understand the true value of an honest review, I, myself, depend on reviews when making purchases and my business only exists thanks to testimonies and reviews from clients. I personally guarantee a fully unbiased review of this product.		DISCLAIMER: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I am in no way connected or related to the seller.
0,great
0,I had a micro sim (which was cut from a mini sim) and used this cutter to cut it again into a nano sim, and it worked great!, it came with all the tools necessary to cut the micro sim, even sand paper (I needed to do a little sanding on the sim)	So bottom line this cutter works :-)
0,this phone is ok
0,I originally purchased this charger because my husband broke my original charger which came with my phone. I didn't want to purchase it through Samsung because lets face it they are super expensive when it comes to buying products online from there. So I thought what the heck I can spare $24.00 to buy me a charger. I was a bit skeptical at first because I honestly thought I wouldn't get one that was a good charger. But it was the right one and has lasted me so far.
0,And hopefully I've been using Galaxy S4 for 4 years by now haha :)	Its matte finish gave me such a nice and light feeling everytime I use my phone.	Just one terribly bad thing I shake my hands a little and I failed many times applying it into right place.		I don't think there is such a bubble-free adhesive in the world - I think it's more about the skills though..	I made a tiny little bubble in my 3rd attempt, and over the past year, it kind of grown up.		So just make sure you don't make a bubble inside. Here's my tip - Use the given adhesive tape wisely to clear out all the dust on the screen although you think you don't see them. Start your work on dust-free place like bathroom - that's where I did.		Only reason I gave 4 stars is that I can't see the screen well (as well as the screen is wearing nothing) when I'm at outside with sunlight. I guess it's that matte anti-finger print finish is think.	Otherwise, it's great.
0,Great product, really protects the phone
0,Works great, very impressed with the heavy duty cord,,double what you get with your apple product,  would buy again.
0,Greatttttt
0,works great
0,For simple purpose, this is useful. I use sometimes in the desktop where nobody can move it because it could fall easy.
0,Looks great although I didn't realize it doesn't protect completely the front edges.
0,Great buy thanks!
0,Great case! Got dirty real fast though.
0,Fits snugly. Non-slip case. Does what it's supposed to do.
0,This is a great item. It's as described and then some.  I love the watch charger on top and the fact that you can hold the cord AND plug it in underneath.  Great idea.  I love that it has the 3 extra ports in front. I plugged in my iPhone with no problem.  This is made pretty sturdy. One of the minor complaints I have is that the lid should have some sort of snap closure or something to keep it closed.  The iPhone watch cord is really long and by the time I got it all in the bottom it kinda made the top lift a little. I may try to redo the wire later on to see if I can get a better fit. It would be nice if they would have something that comes with it to help wrap the cord nicely.  The only other thing that would be nice is if it was a little bigger to fit the iPhone or  have something on the side to hold the iPhone while it's charging.  But overall this is a great item and I would certainly purchase again. I did receive a discount to review this product and there you have my HONEST review.
0,Super snug!! You will love it.  Very slim perfect fit.
0,Good quality, simple installation
0,Great
0,For a basic TPU case, this exceeds expectations.  My only complaint, and this may just be personal opinion, is that the case is still a bit 'slick' to the touch and I would want more grip to ensure the phone doesn't slip out of hand.  Still, fitment and function leave very little to complain about with this case.
0,Wife loves this case.
0,I got this to measure EMF around my new house, and use it to move electronic devices around to keep them further away from where I usually am.		For example:	*CFL lights max out this meter in the magnetic, electric, and radio bands. I now try to keep them up and away about 4' from where I sit/work.	*LCD monitors don't put off anything but a little bit of magnetic within 1'.	*My PC puts off a large magnetic field so I no longer have that sitting next to me.	*Helps you locate faulty wiring in houses - you should be able to pick up a little bit of Electric (AC) energy around outlets, but if it spikes there's probably something wrong.	*I have cell phone amplifiers, wifi routers, cellphone microcell stations, and regular AM/FM powered antennas. The "Radio/Microwave" setting doesn't really spike out next to these devices unless I'm within 5ft of them - rather odd.	*Some fans put off magnetic/electric energy that can be detected for 20ft through walls.		If you're going to test things in your house you might want to make sure everything else is off first - so you don't get any false readings.		It's a handy and informative tool to have, trifield is a well recognized name by many enthusiasts. I wish the price were cheaper, but it's solid unit, and should I don't see it failing ever.
0,Got this for my sibling as an extra battery while in college and works perfectly! He can carry it around in his bag so there's no chance he'll be stuck without a working phone.
0,Beautiful case		I usually go with spigen cases		However this one is a must have...
0,Great product. Work fine, the magnets are really strong
0,Very satisfied with the case. What you see is what you get. Nice heavy duty case. Not made cheap. Very ffuntional to put on and take off. You don't feel like you are going to break it.
0,A bit small for LG-G4 with a case on. it fits, but it looks stressed as if it will fail.	I'll try it later on without the case.
0,Stalion iPhone 5S Case with Belt Clip  Fuchsia Pink	  I got this Stalion Phone Case for my friend who loves to change cases-to go with clothes, her mood. etc.  This phone case is sturdy & attractive.  Plus it has a 24 month warranty!  The fuchsia color will make it easy to find your phone since it's not your usual black.  Also you can clip it to different things around the house so you can keep it close as you wander around the house.  Of course, it's made to clip on a belt-so there you go-that's handy & close!	  This Stalion phone case also has a kickstand to stand your phone up to watch videos or talk. The stand is sturdy also, as is the case. The case has a texture to it, so your phone won't be as likely to slip out of your hand.	  The case lines up, with access to your buttons, etc. With the 24 month warranty, this company sure stands by their product!!	  I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. It's great!  Thank You!!
0,good fit
0,very nice
0,works well, and is a good source of portable power.
0,Great case at a affordable price and lets me appreciate the nice look of my new iPhone SE and offers very good protection I know because I already dropped my phone on concrete and it bounced! My phone was completely OK! I would have gave this case 5 stars but for the fact when I removed my phone to clean the case I notice a slight yellowing on it . Not a problem as of now because it isn't noticeable when my phone is in the case, I should mention my case is now 2 weeks old and  if the yellowing worsens I will update my review.
0,excellent quality, excellent cell phone, I got exactly what I bought, very happy. Recommended. 5 stars because it is what I wanted. Very Good
0,As advertized, good protection for the phone
0,This case is slim and sleek, and yet it does a good job of protecting the phone. I've used this case since I got my Moto G, and I've had no issues with it stretching or warping. The case is durable (no scratches yet), and the glossy sides make the phone easier to grip.		The cutouts are precise and in all the right places. I like how the case doesn't cover up the metal band on the back, making it seem like there's no case at all.		I haven't dropped my phone on concrete, but the small lip on the front should protect the screen from direct impact. In addition, the lip makes it safe to place the phone screen down on a table.
0,I really like this battery.  I carry it with me daily at work because sometimes I go to training or meetings that last too long and keep me away from my wall charger.  I bought a couple short cords to match my devices and I am ready for all day meetings!  It keeps my two phones and Apple Watch topped off.
0,This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's sturdy yet, light weight and I can use it with my phone upright or on it's side.
0,Works fine
0,Great fit around the phone. The only drawback is the protruding area around the usb type c charger port. I wish it was more thought out and blended into the case better.
0,What I like about the phone:		Just about everything!  For someone like me who wants a pretty basic smart phone, this phone has everything I am looking for and more.  The phone holds a charge for a very long time.  Besides making phone calls (and the phone does an excellent job of this - the phone calls are nice and clear and I have had no problem with dropped calls) and text messages (this is first time I have been able to do group text messages!), it does so much more.  It comes with many apps including Google, a calendar, a camera, a clock, music, quick memo, voice command, voice recorder, YouTube, and more.  It has a QWERTY keyboard.  You can reject incoming calls if you like.  The phone has caller ID, blocking, call waiting, conference calling, and call forwarding.  The phone is hearing aid compatible, it has an alarm you can set, and a countdown timer so you can use the phone as a stopwatch.  For someone like me this phone really is a mini computer!		What I don't like about this phone:		While I like just about everything about this phone, there are couple of things I don't like about it.  The main thing is the on/off switch.  Every other device I have has the on/off switch on the top or side but for some inexplicable reason the on/off switch on this phone is on the back, right between the volume controls.  Even after having this phone a few months, I have difficulty turning the phone off - hitting the volume button instead, which is annoying not only to me but the people around me!  The other thing I don't like is that the phone doesn't have a lot of memory - I don't have a lot of photos on it, no music, and just a few games but are after having the phone just a few weeks it was already telling me I had no memory. I deleted two games but I am still getting the low memory message.  Other than those two things I really like this phone.		Bottom-line:		The LG Volt 2 No Contract Phone is a perfect phone for people like me who are new to the world of smart phones or those who are used to smart phones but don't want to spend a lot of money on one. In the end, I really like this phone.
0,This charger works perfectly and at a great price why buy it from the cell phone provider at a much higher price and it is the same product I ask myself that all the time. It is made with quality and is very durable works perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a wall charger. I have purchased extras to use in multiple rooms since the price is so good!
0,Excellent product. Would recommend to others. This is the best holder for when I am sitting down in my chair. I feel like there is no other tablet holder that's  any better than this one. Excellent job for this seller.
0,Protects my phone and is cute!
0,impressive
0,Nice grip to this case
0,Great seller and great phone. Everything as promised. Very happy with this purchase. Phone unlocked new and fully working. A+!
0,These have literally saved my watch face many times.
0,Excellent protection at an excellent price!
0,Got these for a multi-port charger and they work I great. No complaints at all. I have not tried to use these for data transfer, they are awfully short for that so I wouldn't use them for that personally. I don't know if they are good for that or not. But they charge devices just fine.
0,Awesome case. Excellent quality.
0,The LG G5 Screen Protector is a great screen protector, and if your screen protector is anything like mine, then you will love the convenience of being able to have a clean and clear screen protector. Our old screen protector was starting to make look funny , so I thought it was time to look out for a new screen protector. Of all the screen protector I researched, one stood out above all the rest  this one.	I liked it so much that I decided to share my research findings with you. I did got it for free for testing.
0,Works well
0,Item reviewed: New Trent Trentote Galaxy Note 4 Rugged Leather Case.	I have to be honest  I bought this case thinking it was camo colored, and it is not. But instead of being disappointed, I am just the opposite. This case is so darn good looking that everywhere I go, people ask me about it.	I got my Note 4 at a time that there just weren't many cases out there. In fact, I wanted a case that included the built in screen guard and all I found was one kind available. Yes, there are more available now, but nothing has looked good enough to make me want to try it. But thenI saw this case by New Trent and felt it was worth looking at. I have used New Trent cases in the past and have found them to be well built and of a higher quality than many out there.	This was no exception. The ports and plugs are all in the right place. The case seems to be designed well enough to handle some tossing around and the fit of the phone in the case was perfect. The case is advertised as dirt proof as well as splash and shock resistant and I have no reason to doubt that it is.	But the best thing about this case is its looks! I am a guy who prefers function over looks any daybut this case is just so nice looking that I can honestly say the pictures found online do not do it justice. The first day I had it, I went to a store and a restaurant, and both are places that I go to on a regular basis. Never has anyone said a thing about my phone, which I usually set on the table while I am there. Not this time  at both locations people who I know have seen this same phone on several prior occasions, now made a comment on both how nice the phone looked and about how expensive it must have been. And the only difference is this case. It really does look that good. And it was much less expensive than the other case out there!	But more than that  it also works well. Granted, I didn't hurl my phone down or kick it across the room, but you can tell the phone is well protected in this case. I don't know how New Trent can improve on this one. I highly recommended this case. Nowif they would just make a case for my Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 that looked this good, I would be all set!
0,This case is really cool - nice canvas fabric on the outside, and it's nice and sturdy. The only drawback is that the edges are so big that it's really hard to plug in headphones in the jack and a little hard to switch the vibrate button on and off. But for a good protective case, it's worth it.
0,Recently upgraded from the iPhone 4 to the 5s.		This case is great! The matte finish helps for the grip. The buttons for the volume and sleep/wake works and responsive. The cut outs for the head jack is nice and large. Worked with my beats pro jack. Cut out for lightning cable is perfectly fine, cannot say for third party lightning cables but its fine with the apple stock.		What made me a little worried was the camera cut out. I've seen some cases with a larger cut out but my photos were clear, not washed out and the flash worked fine.		There is a lay on the table design but its very subtle. I currently have a temporary screen shield and there's plenty of lay on the table design. But I'll see how it is once I've received my tempered glass screen shield.		Overall great product!		- Slim	- Simple yet, stylish	- Great grip	- Decent price! (Bought at $19.99)
0,good
0,Fit my Samsung S5 active.  Application was easy. Instructions were very concise.  Has been on phone 2 days. No complaints thus far.
0,Bought this for my son and he loves it.
0,Awesome
0,I love the very strong but flexible arm. It holds my 7" phablet (phone and tablet in one) perfectly. I don't have to worry about it falling out and it doesn't get in the way of the screen either. This product made it much easier for me to follow directions and not compromise my driving safely. Great buy!
0,Fit my Iphone 6 perfectly and soft. clear .
0,Awesome,  great price.  And love how I can charge two at a time
0,Great shield. Fast shipping.
0,Great protection for the Note 4 and the screen is just as clear as not having the protection. Well worth it. There is a little bit of space around the edges of the phone left for the cases which I consider to be a benefit otherwise the pressure from the case causes the glass to warp over time.
0,I have a lot of lenses for my camera's. and this lense is made as well as my Canon Lenses. I expected a little more of a wider view but this will be great for an upcoming trip to Barcelona and Greek Islands. Instead of hauling my camera around I can use this lense. We shall see how it faired after the trip and the pictures are downloaded....
0,good
0,I purchased this case for myself and it exceeded my expectations. It is absolutely fabulous and I love it and will definitely order from you again!
0,This dock is amazing.  It turns my ATRIX 4G into a computer, keeping me in touch and entertained while travelling.  I wish I had bought it sooner.  It works perfectly as advertised, I highly recommend it.  Also, it arrived in sealed Motorola packaging.
0,Great buy
0,Have had it a week now and work wonderfully.
0,Good fit, easy install
0,Excellent!
0,I've had the good fortune of having to purchase new screen protectors for my S7 edge, because the ones I've bought before have been,  unsatisfactory to say the least.  I bought this one because of the price and ignored the reviews. Best screen protector I've purchased,  ever.  I will no longer buy Skinomi, Zagg, Armorsuit, or any other generic ones.  This fit perfectly on my phone and the cases I've used don't interfere with it. I've had to replace 4 because they peeled from my case and from wear. If you really want to protect your phone,  this is a clear winner. I am not affiliated with IQ shield, but would love free stuff!
0,Just what my mom needed.	works perfectly	durable	bit expansive but worth the money because it lasts for a long time	My mom had it almost a year now and it is the same as when I bought it.
0,Works very well and fits like the original.
0,Good protection for iPhone and durable.

0,Very nice phone/wallet case!  Looks good and phone fits well inside.  Feels like a very high quality product!  Keep in mind that if you use the pulse feature you may have to take the phone out of the case.
0,Easy installation  (about 7 min)  dries clear and very smooth to the touch.  Not rubbery like the other ones. No issues with bubbles.
0,We bought it for our trip to Belize, as we were going to stay on the island with no power except solar and thought we need something to charge our electronics even if we do not use it much. Anker's solar charger worked great , quickly charging out iPhones and iPads under bright tropical sun. We use them mostly for reading books. Will recommend it for trips like ours. Clean energy when you need it.
0,It doesn't fit exactly right, but is still useable and convenient.  Cards fit perfectly and the strap make it easier to carry.
0,Works just as described and it has three pockets for your credit cards or what not. I wish it had more though because I have a ton so it leaves me hanging deciding what to bring and what to leave, but it's a healthy thing for my hoarding habit of carrying everything that I never use. The cash pocket is not long enough that you can put your cash in unfolded, so expect some bulkiness if you carry lots of cash. I know I do, I like to be loaded with 1 dollar bills, but if you are a credit card person then your good. The case is really nice leather and looks good. The one thing that I had a problem with it is that when it is bulky the cases' flap with the magnet to keep it close is too short, and it won't keep the case closed. I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review and I am giving it 5 stars because it's a high quality built and I think that it is not for those who carry bulky wallets, just the bare essentials, so I can't say it is bad, but personally for me I wish it had more pockets, and a longer magnetic strap. If you don't carry many things, this will look beautiful with your phone and it will close well so no worries. I received this product at a discount for my review.
0,Great case with screen protection glass, Zizo fits perfect on my phone, and protects it from drop damage and screen scratches. You want great protection for your phone Zizo is it. I've recommened  Zizo to all my friends and family. This is my 4th case on my newest phone.
0,Has saved two phones. Just by looking at them you would have bet anything both phones were busted.  However after lifting the tech armor the phone screens were perfect.... Ty
0,I have to say I am extremely pleased with how fast this arrived, It is so much easier to put on phone than the other types. I ordered two just in case I messed up trying to put it on, but now I will just have a spare since it was so simple. I would totally refer this product and company to all my friends.
0,way better than I expected love it
0,I had a more expensive armband in my cart until I found this. For the price, it's WAAAYY exceeded my expectations. It came well-packaged in a small cardboard box and included a screen protector, which I have not applied. The Velcro strap is long enough to go around a thick arm, but you can also use it on a thinner one by wrapping the Velcro under the phone holder and around to secure. The holder is a soft silicone and I have no fear that my expensive phone will fall out. I've jogged, ridden my bicycle and mowed the lawn wearing this. Nice product!
0,I really like this case. Doesn't add any weight to the phone at all. Great fit. I don't have any complaints
0,worked as expected for 2 years,no complaints
0,Excellent
0,This is by far the best case I've used.  It has just the right amount of pocket slide, it's easy to hold, and it looks great.  I'm on my second case - the first one lasted a year of heavy use before the corner busted off.  I immediately bought another - I can't imaging using an iPhone without one.
0,This is the case to get if you have an iPhone8 plus. I was walking into Sam's Club just the other day and my daughter hit my phone out of my hand, as I was getting my membership card pulled up, and the phone fell and hit the large rocks that border the walkway. I thought there was no way I was picking up a working much less in tack phone, but let me tell you, the phone is perfect. No broken parts, no major scuffs on the case and none of the plastic even cracked. I do have a glass screen protector as well and that wasn't even cracked. This is my second Luvvitt case, I had one on my iPhone 6s Plus for over 2 years and the only issue I had with that was thin plastic that broke and the color faded. The thin plastic has been removed from this model and the color seems to be through the plastic and not just a surface color. Overall one of the best cases you could ever trust to protect your device.
0,I also purchased another battery for my phone as my badk up and their working great! My original battery wasn't holding it's charge all day, so this was my solution. It's much cheaper than a new phone. My phone is 2 yrs old and I want to wait at least another year or 2 before I purchase another one.
0,Huawei has been known to produce relatively good budget smartphones and more recently some mid-range and high-end (or high priced) devices such as the Nexus 5X and 6P.		The Honor 5X falls into the 'budget' category with 'mid-range' specs. For $199 USD it is a great deal. If you can live without the CONs below then this phone is right for you. Otherwise be prepared to spend another $100 - $150 USD.		PROs:		***Most of the specs it offers is similar to the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, One Plus X and Nexus 5X/6P***		Fingerprint scanner	Dual-SIM LTE slots AT&T, T-Mobile compatible	Snapdragon 615 Octa-core processor	16GB built-in storage	128GB microSDHC removable expandable storage	2GB of RAM	5.5-inch IPS LCD Corning Gorilla Glass screen	1920 x 1080p	13MP front 5MP back cameras	Aircraft-grade alumimium metal construction	FM Radio	3000 maH battery		CONs:		No NFC (No Android Pay?)	No WiFi Calling (this seems to be carrier specific)	No 5 GHz AC WiFi (only 802.11 BGN)	Older version of Android Lollipop 5.1.1 (through there have been news of proposed Marshmallow 6.0 update)	No USB Type C (stills uses microUSB therefore no fast-charging)	16GB built-in storage is so limited (but the 128GB expandable helps)		Final Comments:		Again for the price of $199 USD Huawei gives more than enough specs.	Many dislike the EMUI skin/launcher, but it does not bother me.	You can always install another skin/launcher.	TWRP 3.0 and Root is already available and installable.	Hopefully Custom ROMs will be out soon.	The Fingerprint scanner is very good and gives a faster response than the iPhone and HTC A9.	I have yet to test and see if it works in purchasing apps.	I will update the review as soon as I find out.
0,Great Product!
0,Bought for my Iphone 4s, it fits great! Originally I had an Otterbox Commuter case but it was very bulky and I had to remove part of the case whenever I hooked it up to any sound dock, got old real quick. This one is AWESOME! I love that it doesn't really add any bulk to my phone.
0,Fit and finish is as stock. Qi charging functions as it should.
0,This is far and away the best screen protector I have ever used! You will never see me use one of those flimsy plastic ones again. This glass protector went on straight and easy with not a single speck of dust, thanks to the clear instructions and the helpful YouTube video. I used the two pack to put protectors on my wife's phone and mine. I messed up on one of the phones by not following the instructions so the seller sent me a new protector that installed perfectly. The cover feels like the phone's screen and the touch sensitivity is perfect. Where this seller becomes 5 star is in their follow-up to see if your screen protector worked well for you and their very quick replacement of the protector when I messed up. For the price this purchase is a "no-brainer". Just buy it and you will be happy!
0,Got this for my fiancee.  It's as good as I expected from Magpul.  Great fit, slim, easy to hold.  Great protection. Typical Magpul!!!
0,This is a gift for my Brother, who works in the tough wild. Mud and dirt are the most risks he meets on work. His iPhone 4s was dead in the marsh. With this case on, he said, he'd never worry about the risks during working and haven't miss any call since then. Yesterday, he came back in a soaked dress due to the pouring rain, but the phone were definitely and completely protected. As a waterproof case, it gets the job done.
0,Nice durable case, easy to put on my iPhone 5S. I think it's even better than my otterbox and the price really good, I will be ordering more. Thank you for the speedy delivery:)
0,this is super cute. its not the best but it is worth the money that i spent on it. would amend to others.
0,Bought a black one before a trip in late 2016 & cant say enough good things about it! Got 3 more (2 white & 1 red) for family xmas gifts on prime day 2018.		- minimal, Apple-like packaging	-price is right (especially if you catch them on sale	- finish is slightly matte so scratches shouldnt be an issue	- happy with colors (red is decent - could be a little deeper but its not orange-y)	- very sturdy feel	- great compromise of size/weight & power	- terrific battery life	- includes a nice little mesh storage bag		Dont fret when you open it and its only charged 25-50%. I believe thats intentional, for safer shipping due to the battery (dont want a fire in the delivery truck!).
0,Works great so far. I love the length too so it can use my phone from my bed. And it doesn't make the message about not being a certified apple product come up.
0,OtterBox DEFENDER SERIES Case for iPhone 7 Plus is a monster of a case. When they say ROBUST they mean robust. I couldn't use this for myself personally, because Im a little too dainty for this case, but its perfect for my husband.		It locks up your new iPhone 7 tight and you can pitch it around, drop it, throw it around and it withstands it all. It also comes with a belt clip which is fancy for the manly man that wants to display his huge phone on his belt. The belt clip does have a handy benefit of working as a kickstand to set it up and view your movies. I like this much better than the belt clip. Im not a huge fan of the built in screen cover  those drive me crazy. I need to touch the screen. I get it protects from scratches, but I like the ones you stick on. The upgrade has Alpha Glass optional  I think that would have been a better choice.
0,Love this case, now I feel my phone protected for any drops. Lmao
0,Charges my fiancee's GS7 nice and quick. She loves it. Only downside is that she can't use her magnetic car mount.
0,This was pretty easy to install with the assistance of a YouTube video. However make sure you have a micro screwdriver and a tiny micro because it is impossible to complete otherwise. However I only gave four stars because now the speakers sometimes don't work but not sure if that is related to this installation. I would recommend because it fixed the charging problem and was an inexpensive solution.
0,For the iPhone 5 no works good because the cable to charge the phone is long and the stand no have space, but for iPhone 3GS and 4S work perfect
0,I love how simple and sturdy it is for my apple watch series 1. Wish it came in other colors as well but overall love this purchase and you can't beat the price!
0,Awesome! very snug and cool looking! only thing is the buttons are a little too stiff and its hard to get to the ringer switch. but either than that great bumper
0,Perfect. Worked exactly as expected and as advertised.
0,A nice case, I wish they had a screen protector for it
0,This has saved my phone so many times! Bought them for my kids too!
0,Love it
0,works well just wish sony allowed 2V charging as it takes a long while to charge my vita.
0,Case looks good on phone but don't know if it will provide protection? If you are looking to just protect your phone and don't care about how it looks with case look somewhere else.
0,Great phone for someone looking for basic plus in a smartphone.  This is a windows phone so you will have to get used to that operating system.  It plays muisc, takes pictures, emails, texts, wifi as good as any phone.  The GPS is just ok but that should be fine for most people.  This is a backup phone in case we have issues and it has never failed.		I used it only on an ATT network with no problems.
0,While I was visiting my sister, my 3 foot cord just wasn't cutting it. I realized I needed to get a longer cord when I travel so that I can plug in my devices and not have to sit my phone on the floor. I loved the colors and figured I wouldn't forget my device or not see it. When my package arrived, they were all inside a plastic bag. I tried out all 3 cords to make sure they worked before I put them away. I had a problem with one of the cords not staying in my phone or tablet and contacted the seller. They immediately responded and said they would send out a replacement. They apologized and said it would be a week. Since I wasn't using them immediately, I had no problem waiting. The cord arrived, works beautifully. I keep one on my desk, one beside my chair and one in my travel supplies. They are pretty and bright and do what they are supposed to. I appreciate the seller standing behind their product!
0,I love it
0,I wrote my first review and I was contacted by the company, and they made sure I got a working battery.  They stayed in contact with me until I got a working battery, is not many businesses that care after they have their payment, I will recommended this battery to others.
0,Girlfriend loves the fact she can have debit card and drivers license in phone and doesn't have to carry purse everywhere. (Samsung S7)
0,Cover does everything it says it will at a nice price.  white gets a little dirty but cleans well.  After a few months, still looks new.
0,this case is awesome! barely adds any size, but gives great protection. I'd highly recommend it. I've tried 3 other cases and this is easily the best.
0,Good
0,Decreases touch sensitivity a bit but does what it needs to do. Covers the whole screen!
0,It came ahead of time, wrapped nice and tight and so many compliments even my husband remarked on it. For a girly girl, my phone was the best, so delighted. Even came with extra stones n pearls just in case.
0,Bought this for a friend shes into the whole hello kitty thing so I got this for her she really likes it.
0,The Galaxy is a big phone but thin so I bought this to give it some bulk. It helps the phone withstand the occasional tumble. The stand is great for watching tv or certain games.
0,Just as described.
0,Grandson loves it . He has my streak 7 now and uses it a lot. Thank's
0,WORKED FINE
0,Ordered this case based on the reviews from others.  The case has a hard feel to it and the rubberized coating gives it that solid feeling when you are holding it in your hands. The case does add a quite a bit of bulk to an already bulky phone, so its a trade off for more protection, but also more bulk. The case does make it easy to slide out the keyboard, without the feeling that the phone is going to fly out of your hands as it can do without the case.  All of the openings are in the right places and has a precise fit on the phone. I like the fact that its not as easy to press the on/off button with the case on, as I found I was pressing the button by accident too often before I had the case since its located on the side instead of the top like most other phones.  The case is well made and seems like it would protect the phone if you were to drop it with the case on.  In summary, nice case that should protect the phone, as well as keep it functional and looking like new.
0,Mom loves this phone and recommeded to friends, and they love it, too. Great phone for the price. 4 Stars.
0,OK
0,Overall i highly recommend this phone, i feel as though it is the best value on the market right now priced at 150USD as of 1/9/2017		Things I LIKE about this device	-the screen, its very crisp and colorful	-the front facing speakers are very nice for watching videos and speakerphone calls	-the cloud storage function is unique and cool	-the fingerprint reader works well 9 times out of 10, and its placed very well. this is my first phone with a fingerprint reader and im quite impressed by the tech	-the processor and RAM are very nice, i haven't seen any slowdowns on this phone	-the WiFi adapter must be pretty quick i have very fast download times on this device	-its fully compatible with my network including 4G LTE (tmobile)	-it looks, feels, and runs like a premium device, despite the price	-the built in apps (messaging, phone, contacts) are nice	-there is no bloat software to take up space and never be used, more phone makers should do this!	-USB-C is the future and this connector and cable is awesome!		Things I DON'T like	-the display is not AMOLED, which would have made the display much more vibrant	-the screen has a mild amount of ghosting, but it took me about a week to notice that at all, its not a huge deal.	-NO MICROSD, but the cloud storage kind of makes up for that.	-the phone is slightly too big for me, i feel like i have to use both of my hands to use the device, again its only a 5.2 inch screen, the trend right now is 5.5 inch screens, which would be too big to operate comfortably.	-the speakers don't sound amazing, but its only phone speakers, they usually don't sound amazing, but at least they are loud	-non removable battery, im so tired of this on modern phones		ADDITIONAL OPINIONS		-the downside to this phone using USB-C is that its so new, that i don't have any spare cables, the only cable that i own is the one included with the device, but that's not really an issue with the phone		I was extremely picky in looking for phones, my previous phone was a galaxy s3 that had become so worn out that it was basically unusable. i wanted a phone that would be an upgrade in almost every department, such as	-android 6 from the factory	-under 5 inch screen	-made in 2016	-removable battery	-1080p AMOLED screen	-microsd card slot		That's all i needed, and believe it or not there are no phones that check ALL of these boxes that were within my budget (under 300USD), so i had to settle on something at some point. i could have got a galaxy s5, but it was made in 2014, and im so sick of Samsung products breaking on me. I also looked at Motorola products and they didn't impress me for the price, that being said the Motorola G4 plus was a serious contender for my next phone. then i found the nextbit robin after my friend bought one, and i was initially drawn to it because it ticks enough boxes that i was willing to compromise at that price point. it just doesn't use an AMOLED screen, or have a  microsd slot, or a removable battery, which i would kill for, but i don't think i will ever get a phone perfect for me if i want a brand new phone in a market dominated by phablets and limited to no expandable memory
0,Simply awesome!!  I've owned several of these portable charger and this one is the one.
0,These work great so far and give me the length that I need. I like to have a cord in every room so I don't constantly have to move cords and plugs around.
0,Like these screen covers fits perfect,awsome.
0,I have one of these in every room, and take it with me when I remember!  It is awesome!
0,This is the best mount I've purchased thus far! It holds my iPhone 6s Plus securely even with a case on! The mount also secures to both tripods that I have securely and doesn't crack around the tripod mount like cheap mounts do. Would be 5 star if they added a small handle to expand the spring.
0,I do diamond Painting and I bought this to charge my light pad at night, I literally just got it and have just finished fully charging it, so will have to put an update to say how long it will charge the light for, but I did check it with both my Samsung Note 8 as well as my Light Pad.		But for those of you, who's did not come with instructions, mine did - which I have included with my photos, hope it helps!
0,One of a few phone cases that I rotate through my collection on a regular basis.  This case was obviously handmade and the one that I received was nicely done.  The rhinestones on it are beautiful, but you have to be careful how you handle this case as the decorative features can be damaged if its laid down roughly or handled improperly.  It is a flashy case for anyone who likes a little bling with their phone device.  The price is not bad either for this Galaxy Note 3 case.
0,Really useful when I'm setting at office or at home doing something. I've attached it to the laptop and really loved it :).
0,Very good purchase! Love the phone.
0,Probably best cellphone holder I ever owned. Can be used vertically, horizontally, and its adjustable.
0,Great
0,Good
0,I have had many cases for phones including Otter Box and this is one of the best products you will find in this price range. This compares very favorably to the Otter Box at less then have the cost. It fits the phone perfectly and provides a high level of protection. I would definitely look to buy this case for any future phones that I purchase.
0,Great product. I still have it on my tab after 4 years & it still going strong
0,Never use anything but APPLE certified for Apple products (except for cases to protect your devices) Everybody's deal is better than APPLE!
0,love it
0,This thin case  has semi transparent color which adds minimal noise to the already elegant LG G3 phone, while providing enough protection for careful use
0,I had purchased a different case for my S6, and the flap began to tear in a short time. The material wasn't flexible enough. This case is thinner and more flexible, and seems to be standing up well. I put a lot of cards, etc. in it, and the flap stays fastened. I do wish the clip on the leash was larger, because with the other one I was able to clip my key ring to it when I went out. I could get a bigger clip, but the hole that it goes through is too small. But I really like this case.
0,It's a pretty cool phone I bought it to use for a mp3. My main phone I don't like to bring to the gym I have damaged a few devices with steel weights. Price was perfect for what I needed. I read a few reviews down below and cant agree with a bunch of them. I do not have any problems with the touch screen. I don't see to much lag but I also don't keep 100 apps on any phone I only download the few that I will use. Which is probably noore than say 15 apps. One reviewer said great phone but hard to program? That's strange I didn't know you needed to do any html or c++ to get the phone to work I think you may need to rethink the idea of your statement. When you call to get the phone to be activated I always spoke to a person or had a automated computer activate any phone I ever had. Zero programming involved. If you are used to flip phones I would definitely buy a iPhone for my first smart phone then move on to Android.
0,Easy to install - I was able to apply it on the first time with no bubbles. The Dust removal tape is helpful too.
0,Fit perfect, excellent quality
0,doesn't protect camera lens
0,great product and price
0,great one i like it
0,Awesome. Fits great. Not slippery.
0,Great case!!!! This case has a great fit and the device feels secure. The construction of this product is second to none, feels great in my hand.
0,fits as expected, looks just like the picture(black). buttons were easy to push, not much force needed. Wallet part is tight, holds 3 cards securely. I wish there was more of a lip around the front edge for facedown protection but otherwise wonderful case.
0,gift
0,I recieved this case about a month ago. After a week I fell down while hiking and my phone got a nasty scratch. Luckily I had this phone case or my phone would have been scratched terribly. Other than my fall, I've had no other scratches, my phone has been safe and it all works great. Though the stand could have been made better as the move does move around (if you're in a train). If you need a case that will protect your phone and don't care about the stand this is a high-quality phone case, if you need the high-quality with a reliable phone stand  you may need to look somewhere else.
0,The wife loves the protection and convenience this case provides, and of course the bright color makes it easier to find in her purse.
0,Just fine
0,good
0,Works great. Got it for my husband as gift and he has his Apple gadgets organized
0,It perfect choice amongst a whole lot of product, get it for yourself and testify. It's light and easy to fix.
0,I was provided an Amplim Embossed for Samsung Galaxy S4 (Eiffel Silver-Black Design) for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.		What You Should Know Before You Buy:	 Solid case that offers good protection to the body of the phone.	 Multiple Embossed designs with various graphics, including Eiffel Tower focused designs.	 Perfect, snug fit.	 All buttons and ports are easily accessible.		Detailed Review:	 Look and Installation - The product came in a clear hanging display box with minimal product information on it. Inside the box was only the case encased in a plastic holder that slid out of the box. The back of the case had a design of the Eiffel Tower embossed onto a metal plate.  The case wrapped around the back and the sides providing good protection to the phone.  Once the case is on, it looks nice and adds minimal bulk while having a solid build.		 Use and Performance - Once the case was installed, it worked as intended. The case covers the back and sides of the phone adequately to provide good protection.  There are also holes for access to all buttons and ports and a hole for the camera. All buttons and ports were easily accessible.  It also felt comfortable to hold.		Conclusion:	Overall, this is a nice case that offers good protection to the body of your phone.  The Eiffel Tower embossed design on the back looks really cool and will most likely be a discussion point with your friends.  If you are looking for a cool case that provides good protection to your phone and like the design options, this case is worth a look.
0,I love this case and it protects my phone as good as an outer box.
0,Bought this product after being tired of having to hold my phone while I ran. Went STRICTLY off of all the other positive reviews on it...gotta say they were right! Super comfy fabric and does everything I need it too (even has a plastic screen guard).
0,The color blue is not the same as pictured. It's more of a teal.
0,This is a GREAT cover for ur phone&money but a suspect holster and amazon backs this product to the fullest so i would recommend the purchase of this product everyday of the week and twice on Sunday.
0,This is a nice cable.  Good build quality and works as expected.  No issues.
0,Excellent
0,It works as expected
0,This is a terrific case for protection, but if you use Touch ID, note that this will not work long-term.		When I first got the case, I loved the fact that I could still use Touch ID. After a few months, it was, well, touchy. I cleaned the home button area, and it worked s short time, but eventually stopped again. I am unable to continue using a Touch ID.
0,The best cell phone. Good
0,Good case
0,Sexy case that hug the phone snug. Does not take the appeal of the device away.
0,As you can assume it's kind of fragile since its glass, but it sure beats any other screen protector in regard to clarity and scratch resistance... I've gone through 2 in 6 months though
0,Bought this for a friend. She loved it!
0,Very good quality and phone mount, works great
0,No complaints, small & compact l. I keep in my car as a travel power bank for my IPhone 7 Plus & headphones for the gym.
0,WHEN MY SON HAD THIS PHONE TE CASE CAME IN HANDY BUT NOW HE HAS A NEW PHONE SO I HAVE TO GET ANOTHER CASE .
0,Nice
0,Had it for about 3 weeks. Works wonderfully. Charges everything I have and with normal speed. This has saved me the space of 5 wall warts. Charges the Vita no problem, charges my tablet no problem, all while charging 3 cell phones at the same time. Excellent product with excellent build quality. Highly satisfied
0,So far this case is doing its job. We got it to help protect and to make it easier for my teenager to hang on to her phone.
0,Love my Case it's absolutely perfect. I especially love the color which is the gold and it matches with my iPhone. I get compliments on it all the time.
0,I own a mobile device repair shop and this item is absolutely top notch. Works perfectly. Exactly as described!!
0,Really like it.  Sturdy and lets me see the beautiful rose-gold color of the back.  also keeps phone light weight and slim
0,These screen protectors seem to be doing the job quite well. They have a strange finish - sort of matte, but it makes the finger slide nicely on the screen.  They don't seem to hold oil/dirt as much as the actual screen, either. Installation isn't difficult, and all the necessary items are included.  The video link was dead, but a simple search using google got me to the right video.
0,Good
1,OK.  These are your typical flimsy covers.  I tried to install two of them, and both created bubbles.  The only way to go these days are the glass covers.  Yes they are thicker but they don't bubble and also your finger glides across these.  I also felt that after putting them on despite the bubbles, the screen felt very sticky.  Go the glass option.
1,Connects to iphone extremely fast, charges quickly and has decent battery life.	Does not fit in the ear and feels like it is falling out.  To get the full volume I have to press it in to my ear which defeats the purpose of hands-free.  This was the entry level noise-cancelling Plantronics Bluetooth, and the technology is actually reversed and works like ambient noise amplification:  Everyone tells me the road hum and car noises are amplified compared to my iphone, and ambient noises within a few feet of the mic are just as loud to the other party as my voice.
1,It's cute but as of day one the paint was rubbing off. I've had it almost 3 months and I can't wait to get a different one. I just needed something inexpensive until I can afford a better quality case.
1,I ordered from Dealz Dr, fulfilled by Amazon. This battery is not Samsung OEM as described on the website -- the label plainly says "manufactured by Yongbo." Plus, the water damage indicator was tripped and the battery is non-working! (See photos.)
1,After 1 month with this battery, my phone would shutdown at 80%. After plugging in to charge, it would show 0%	This happened multiple times.
1,It glows...but it doesn't really charge....most phones these days demand their original charger and that's fine, I can't blame this cable for that. But it doesn't really fit well in the phone and I CAN blame it for that. It's cool that it glows, it helped at night. But maybe if you're charging something other than a phone.
1,Only sticks to the edges and popped off when I put the case on. i do not recommend it.
1,First day of having it, so this review will change with some time, but to start off, the phone was DOA when delivered this morning.		After startup, the phone hung on the "You phone is being prepared" screen for about 20 minutes. I got online with VZW tech support, and spent an hour going through various restarts to no avail. I went down the the local VZW, and they hadn't had the phone for sale long enough to really know anything about it. Their thought was that the preloaded SIM might be bad. They gave me a new SIM card, but the same problem presented. They advised just sending the phone back to Amazon and buying one from them instead. Feeling less than happy, I left the store and booted into recovery mode. With nothing left to lose, I did a factory reset. After that, it booted fine and has been working since.		With any new tech, there are going to be some outliers, so I'm sure this won't be a common issue, but be aware that your local VZW store probably won't know anything about the phone if you do have a problem.		EDIT:		After one day with the phone, I'm seriously considering returning it. There are several issues with the device software that stand out:		1.) Gmail, Facebook, MyMail, etc notification volume is not handled by the device notification volume. They're adjusted via the "media" volume control. This means that in order to hear your notifications for these apps, you have to set the volume on media rather high, and then if you decide to play a game, or watch a Youtube video, the volume is cranked up. I find myself having to adjust the volume constantly whenever I want to play a game, or watch a video, then remember to turn it back up so I can hear my notifications after I'm done playing a game. Example: Volume to 90% so I can hear my notifications. Forget about that, use phone as normal. Stop for a bathroom pitstop and want to get in a quick game of "Earn or Die". Sitting in the bathroom stall, the game starts up with the volume at 90%. Quickly lower the volume, finish bathroom business, put phone back in pocket. Now, I'll miss all of my e-mail notifications because I forgot to turn the media volume back up after I was done playing the game.		2.) Charging. Plug the phone in to a charger, and it makes noise. Also, the LED lights up and remains on through charging. You can't turn either one of these off.		3.) Camera. I would love to know why they install a 20MP camera in this thing and then make the default to open up to their "Superior Auto" camera that only records stills at 8MP. So, if you want to take advantage of the 20MP, you have to change to Manual settings before taking any pictures. On a phone that the camera is supposed to be the star, this is ridiculous. Low light, the camera is awful. ISO performance is grainy and pixelated. What's low light? Apparently my 15x14 kitchen with 4x 150watt halogens is low light. Kinda surprising, as you could do surgery in there under all of that light. The camera wanted to use the flash on every single shot I took indoors. The camera also doesn't seem to understand the exposure triangle, as it'll many times have a shutter speed too low for indoor shooting conditions. Next up, camera modes. Holy crap what a waste of space. There are 17 installed camera modes, with more available for download. These show up in your app drawer, and there's no method for hiding apps in the app drawer.		4.) The screen is nice enough, but they waste real estate like it's their job. At the top of each homepage is a series of dots to let you know what page you're on. This is active all of the time, not just when scrolling, so you lose a chunk of space up top. Also, the Home, Back, and Recent Apps buttons are on the screen at all times. Even during full screen games. There's also an issue with Swiftkey when changing to landscape orientation, it leaves a blank strip at the bottom of the screen. Not sure if this is a Sony issue or a Swiftkey issue, but it's never happened on another phone. Also, on screen App icons are comically large. This looks like my 2 year old's Playschool touch screen phone. 1920x1080 is a lot of space, and they manage to use it all up in the most inefficient manner.		5.) Call quality. Just awful. Through the earpiece and through the speaker, all connecting calls sound "airy" and contain lots of static.		The phone is slippery and requires a case definitely.
1,It ok.
1,Did not fit the f3 series for my phone. was not able to return the item so I lost money in the process. The case was nice but it did not fit what I needed it for.
1,Here is the problem , the front cover does not sit flat when opened and flipped around to the back. If you force it to sit flat you will have a 3/4 inch over hang which is cumbersome to hold. I ended up cutting the cover off that's how annoying it was.
1,The outer black frame is so stiff I could not get it on my phone.  It did not stretch at all. I was afraid it would break the phone if I continued trying to get it on. This case was supposed to be one for using when I didn't want to use my case so getting it on and off relatively easily is important to me.		If that were o.k. I do not like the way  the frame covers the volume and on off buttons.  They are not independent of the rest of the frame and are hard to use as the material is too firm.  On the bottom there are cutouts which are fine. There is a depression on the right side of the rear cutout which is supposed to be for using when taking your pulse.  The problem with it is that you are supposed to place your finger on the reader with your index finger parallel to the length of the phone, not the width. So it doesn't add anything to it.	The pins that extend out from the stand are too short and that is why it doesn't stay in the case as it should.	Returning it.
1,Ripped
1,After paring Bluetooth with my Treblab headphone, Ford SYNC, and Toyota Entune the phone call connection will not work. Attempting to connect the phone call option in the Bluetooth setting don't work. It will unchecked itself automatically. The only way to resolve it was to reboot the phone and within a couple of hours the phone call option will become unchecked again.	 I reach out to Sony customer service for help and I was told to get the latest software through the computer which reset the phone and still have Bluetooth problems. Again contact Sony customer service and I was told Sony can't guarantee compatibility with a non Sony device and I have to buy another Sony product to test for compatibility. After such point Sony will then considered the next step.	Buyer beware, Sony will not help you
1,I have had this case sense late April.  I have had it on my phone everyday without removing it.  Today (July 26) I removed it to clean the screen on my phone because the case plastic was sticking to it.  While cleaning, I noticed that the plastic that goes over the flash is split and has a hole in it.  This renders the life proof part useless as if it was to get wet, the phone would get water inside the case.  I have not contacted them about this yet but will and see what their CS says.  I'll update once I have more information.
1,HUGE
1,took 2 weeks to arrive, installed and the headphone port does not work on it.  wrote back for refund/replaement but due to ship time probably past the limit on return so maybe I am SOL
1,This sucks because the camera hole is not big enough when I that pictures it covers the flash and the pictures didn't come out good
1,I put only 4 cards and two 5 dollar bills and that made it too wide, the clasp would not close. What's the point of having a wallet case if you can't carry anything in it?  Not functional
1,Stopped working after 3 weeks of use.
1,I dropped a phone on concrete and it continued to work, that was before I had a "protective case".  After installing this one over the past weekend, I dropped my phone and guess what, it doesn't work anymore.  Is that to blame the case, I don't know but I'm saying this case didn't protect from a drop.  Maybe others have better luck with it.
1,Scratches very easily
1,don't remember this.
1,Terrible broke within 3 months of use
1,This is refurbished. And will not attach at bottom of case & will not adhere to my screen because of it. Do not recommend buying this case. Rip off!!
1,Item is too heavy to stay in ear.  I've tried different size ear caps, but that does not help.  Rubber cover over charging port has no tab to make it easy to open port for charging.  Battery life is about what was advertised ( I think I got about 4 hours of podcast, no music.  Music will likely drain battery faster.)  Overall I was not satisfied with this product.
1,It fit my Galaxy S6 edge nice but didn't feel like it added much protection. The material honestly felt very thin,  like something that would come on the phone when you bought it that was meant to take off and throw away. I ended up buying another case for piece of mind that my $800 phone would be well protected.
1,This thing gets very, very Hot When used
1,Bottom line:This is a case that can serve as a wallet, not a wallet that can serve as a case.		The Book Book feels great. It's smooth, soft and sturdy in the hands, and looks fantastic. When you first get it.		However, after using it daily for a few months, the spine had turned essentially white as it was rubbed off via use. I had it exchanged under RMA, and got an identical one that has similarly worn poorly. Also, the leather is starting to pull away from the camera-hole, and the liner that put over the plastic that holds the phone has slowly peeled off. Again. The Book Book has not even been out for a YEAR, and I've been through 2 cases that have provided sub-par performance.		If you need a 'daily driver' wallet that holds your phone, this is unfortunately not that wallet.		My search continues.		(It must be said that 12South's customer service is fantastic. Clear, concise and speedy, I couldn't ask for more... though a better product would have been one thing...)
1,Does not work as listed. Had to pay 3x as much at local store to get phone activated. Does not work with the services as posted and useless in this case.
1,Very cute but a piece broke off when I tried to take off the cover the first time I put it on my iphone! Cheap.
1,Not good
1,Case was off in terms of fitting,almost exact but unfortunately was not suitable. Color and design along with protective factors were not anatomically correct.
1,Worst one so far. It fit right. Nothing but a dust magnet. Won't buy these again. Had to go thru the first two and luckily the third one wasn't to bad. But you can bet I'm getting another brand. Skinomi is the best so far. Though I'd try these. But they proved to be worse then the 6 for a dollar one.
1,Cheap Cost and a cheap product. I wasn't impressed and never ended up using this because it is so flemsy
1,Returned was a dual charger as indicated
1,Stopped working shortly after I bought it.
1,It holds the phone nicely but it vibrates too much. The whole design is so rigid and sometimes it's hard to see the screen with it shaking. My last holder didn't do that, it held my phone fine.
1,Seemed to work okay but really had to crank on it pretty good to get it to stay,  Tried to take it out and the knob was stuck.  Got it to turn just enough to get the mount out of the CD player but that was it.  The knob would turn no more.  Could probably put it in a vice and use pliers on it but really?	When it did work, it was fine.  The magnet held better than I thought it would and it didn't seem to bounce around much.
1,Update: This charger worked for only a short time and then began to charge for short bursts and then stopped charging altogether .	  When I purchased this thing it was quite expensive and was utterly disappointed with it's hype.	  So much so, I'm back to tell everyone there are better quality chargers for much, much less cash.	  Look elsewhere...
1,Quakity is good but it has sharp edges
1,This case broke in the first two days. It is hard to take on and off, white stains almost instantly, back just fell off. DO NOT BUY!
1,It was stronger than I expected. Poor review because it looks orange but was actually more of peach color. I gave it to woman who dropped it several time before it finally broke. Phone was never damaged.
1,I've used my case for three days and the binding has already cracked. So disappointed in this product. Highly recommend consumers look elsewhere if they want a product to last longer than a few days.
1,Just to many layers of silicone , that felt like glue to pull out of your pocket. Plus works better if u were buying lint brush.
1,It looked great until it started to yellow. Also it fit very loose on my gold iphone 6 plus
1,cheap glass and flimsy plastic make this a pain to use.
1,Worst case ever.		It ripped along the back right edge. Upon removing it and placing a new case I noticed that the back bottom had also ripped, AND apparently any dirt that went into the case melted onto the phone and ultimately peeled the back of the phone.		Be careful with this case.
1,I bought this phone to use for international travel with local SIM cards. But this version of the Galaxy S III is a terrible phone. My wife uses the US Verizon version and it works fine. But the i747 unlocked version is a dud. First and foremost there are no back or menu keys, either on the bezel or on the screen. There is just a single home button in the middle of the bottom bezel like on the iPad. The bottom bezel is metal. But Android isn't designed to just use a Home key as is the iPad. With Jelly Bean many of the Android applications have been updated to not rely on the back and menu keys. But even many of the updated apps haven't extended that functionality into the depths of their settings menus. It's easy to get stuck on a screen with this phone and have to kill the app in Settings, or with a Task Manager app to get back to a main app screen. Some app features are just not available since you can't get to their settings menus because there is no Menu key.		The phone itself has some software problems. The screen periodically locks up. It's particularly annoying when trying to take a quick shot with the camera. To unlock the screen you have to turn the screen off and then back on. Occasionally you have to restart the phone. The camera is quite poor. The photos are totally washed out if there is any indirect sunlight on the subject. Midday with the sun overhead is fine. But if there is any sunlight coming in a window or door opening the photo is over exposed and useless. Of course low light photos are out of the question.		I was ready to throw this phone against the wall and certainly replace it when I got home from travel. But it was stolen at the end of the trip. So good riddance. I've replaced it with a wonderful LG Optimus G for less than half the cost of the SIII. Samsung really fell down when they released this model of the SIII. It should never have gone out. Don't even consider it.
1,fake
1,Extra thick scotch tape.  Poor quality film, impossible to put on without bubbles.  Went into the garbage.
1,(see edited and update review below)		I can confirm that these cables do not allow more than the minimum amount of current to charge your device.  If you are hooking it up to a computer for a charge then you will not see a problem as the charging rate is about 500ma.  If you have a wall charger of 700ma or more you will notice that these cables will not put through the full charge.  I tested  3 out of 3 of these same cables and all had the problem using a program that measures the battery charge rate in my galaxy S4 phone.  All my other cables of various brands put out the correct amount of current.		Update Nov 18th 2014 - The company has seen my bad review and offered for me to test some of their new cables they are sending me.  I am pleased they have reached out.  When I get them I will retest them and post the results.		update 12-4-14	the company sent me 4 replacement cables for me to test.  My testing of the new replacement cables shows that the quality issues I experienced before has been taken care of.  I can recommend these cables as they seem to be a good price and they pass through the full amount of charging current from the newer more powerful charging transformers.  yet another update below......		update 12-10-14	I really hate to say it - especially where the company went out of their way to send me new cables...but 2 of the 4 new cables that came to me do not test well after using them for only a week.  I am not sure of the connectors or the wires themselves but I am sure of my testing methods.  I think the best thing I can say is that they are better than the first batch I got so many month before but in all honesty 2 of the 4 cables will not put though the full charge rate.  They do however all work and most customers will not notice the flaw if they are not using a fast charger.
1,Arrived broken and looked used. Do not buy.
1,i hate it
1,Loved the protection it provided. However, the wet installation process is just not user friendly. The risk of causing wet damage to my device is high.  It was a painstaking process.
1,I bought this hoping to get away from using my wallet and carrying just the phone. It is very attractive and a nice plush unit. The holes for the on/off button and volume button had to be modified because they were too small. I tried putting two cards in each slot. That made the wallet very bulky! Then you have to fold your bills to make them fit which makes the unit even more bulky. This is not conducive to carrying in your pocket! Might be great for a women and a pocket book. The other thing that I thought I might get by was that I have to fold the front around every time I use the phone. That didn't work for me. Sorry. Also the front cover would press against the home button when put in my pocket causing the lock screen to come on thus causing my battery to drain. I would assume that even after the lock screen would turn off, depending on how I moved it would press against the home button and turn back on. I was also worried because being on in my pocket it would get very hot! Which is how I noticed what was happening. It did work well as a stand for watching videos and reading. I tried. It just didn't work for me. I hope this will be hopeful?
1,you get what you pay for i would not recomed this product. no how mant times you follow the video instructions on you tube and cleaned to make sure there was no grease or dust on the phone the screen proctector did not work very well avery time there was tones of airbubbles. you your discreation when buying this protector.
1,It sticks really well, when I put it on my iPhone after I received it in the mail. I noticed what I thought was a scratch at first, but it turned out to be a slight crack which eventually led to it breaking in half after a few days. I wish I could send it in and have it repaired or replaced.
1,Did not stick perfectly how i though they would
1,Mine stopped working after a few month. Was nice when it was working.
1,Screen pops up
1,How does it work? It's job is to suck money from your bank account, once you buy it, only will you see it. T-Mobile on wifi and Verizon has the best call quality.
1,When the case first arrived I thought it was very nice, but what has happened now is the stones on the top piece is peeling off. I have other cases so each week I put a different one on so there is no reason why this should be happening. I had to trash this case NOT HAPPY! !!!
1,I received an used loudspeaker. It's not new! Very dissapointed!
1,NOT WORTH A DAMN and you only get half your money back.. Its packed like a phone cover and you cant make the tabs work on a watch .. USELESS
1,This case does great in the effect of being a selfie light. It's quite bulky and won't allow me to use a charger unless it's the original thing apple charger. The words that are on the back are like stuck on and at some point part of it broke off and stabbed my finger and caused me to bleed pretty back from my finger while I also had to fish that piece of it out of my finger like you would a splinter. Light wise great case. Other wise it's bulky. Can't charge with it on. Difficult to get phone in and out of. And seriously it made me bleed!		I did receive this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for a honest review of the product and customer service. The price I paid had no effect on my review or opinion of the product. If I had any issues with shipping I will notate what and why in the review. If I had any interactions with customer service I will also have that notated in the review with the reason and resolve for the issue and my opinion on how customer service handled the situation. If anything changes due to the product I will update my review accordingly. As of this moment I stand behind my review and rating of the product.
1,I love how this looks on my Apple Watch!  However, I was disappointed when the silver started rubbing off, which I just noticed yesterday. Amazon was great about allowing me to return it.
1,I've been a very satisfied customer for over 2 years using the Alpha I case for iPhone 4 and their ZERO Poly ultra-thin snap-on case.  The ZERO protects my iPhone when not in the leather case, and the iPhone and ZERO fit nicely into the Alpha I for iPhone 4.	My first one lasted 2 years before it started looking a bit too tattered.  This past Christmas, my family bought me a new one.  Now, I decided to upgrade my iPhone 4 to a iPhone 5 so in anticipation of the upgrade, I purchased a ZERO and a Alpha I for iPhone 5.	Today, I got the iPhone 5.  The ZERO snapped right on and works just as fabulous as the original.  To my disappointment, the set would not fit into the Alpha I for iPhone 5.  The new Alpha I was made with absolutely zero tolerance (and zero tolerance for their ZERO case!).		With others here stating their iPhone 5 is too tight (without a snap-case on it), I think Splash is making the Alpha I for iPhone 5 too small.  Alpha 1 + ZERO is a perfect combo.  Now, I have ordered the bulkier-looking Alpha II.  Hopefully it works, or else I have to shop the market for cheap Chinese cases that will fit.		Update: I got the Alpha II. Piece of junk.  I thought the Alpha II would be just a larger version of the Alpha I, but instead, it's a different case design (only elastic on the sides, no leather), and while they say "Napa Leather", it's more like cheap, thin, plastic leather.  Since the sides are only partially covered, if you drop it, you run the risk of the top or bottom of your phone getting dinged up (which happened to me...thankfully I keep a ZERO slim case on mine so only the ZERO got dinged).  Also, I emailed Splash support with my feedback and after a few weeks, they have not even bothered to respond.
1,MY s4 did not fit into the pouch. WAsnt very good to say the least.
1,It kind of works, but is difficult to mount.  The suction cup mount didn't work at all,  The clips for attaching to vents is simple to install, but a PAIN to remove.  I would not buy this again.
1,bad!!!!!!!
1,This product is not worth the money to purchase it. It doesn't fit the phone, it's centimeters too small, the cheap plastic gives off an odor that is very unpleasing. I would return this product but it would cost me more to return shipping. I would not waste my money on this product our product line.
1,Should have tested before I left.  It is DOA.  Plug where the cable plugs in is loose and does not power the watch.  Now I am overseas with no way to charge my phone.
1,I RECEIVED BOTH OF THE BATTERIES BEFORE THE DATE EXPECTED.  These work well and for the price I bought two.  This purchase enabled me to keep my current  LG  phone a little longer thus prolonging the inevitable "smart phone" purchase,		BUT THE Black Rubberized Protector Case for LG Octane VN530  IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND!		CAN YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?		THANK YOU, SANDY
1,I previous purchased another product by UGreen and was completely impressed by the quality of the product. I noticed UGreen had this interesting reversible cable and thought it couldn't be something that actually worked all that good because every tech company would start putting this out everywhere. Since I was so impressed previously by UGreen, I decided to give it a try. I am 100% glad I made that choice. These cables are phenomenal!  I liked them so much I even made a review video for it showing what it does, how it works, and the product in action. I will always buy from UGreen here on out, their products are absolutely amazing! :)		I've posted the review on YouTube, but will be editing this review and posting it on here later in the evening hours while I sleep as the file is a bit large for my slower internet: youtu.be/0LgPTCatexw		UPDATE: Less than 2 weeks of use and the cable no longer stays plugged. It's nice that it's reversible, but it's a waste of money when they don't last even two weeks of nightly use
1,could not get the bubbles out of it !
1,easy to install, but it leaves a very hard to remove sticky residue on the screen. had to spend $4 bucks on andhesive remover to get it off
1,Did not hold up well.
1,Was really happy to find a charger that will actually fast charge on the go. Utterly disappointed. The charger may work, but after 30 minutes of trying to get it to ever be recognized by my phone, with no luck,
1,slow charge
1,Bought this as a replacement for my wife's phone. Overall first impressions were good. Did not like that you couldn't store apps and pictures on a memory card, but the phone had the option to make the card an extension of the on board memory. That failed. The device constantly tells us it is running low on memory, yet the card has 30 plus gigs available. The phone has corrupted three different micro sd cards out of the blue. It will no longer transfer pictures to a computer when connected via usb, even when using Motorola's own software. When you hook the phone up, the computer tells you it is empty. The phone no longer backs up to the cloud either. All settings are correct, but the pictures, contacts, and apps are not there, even after it tells you it has synced. The camera is one of the slowest, hardest to maintain focus, and poorest quality cameras we have had. For quite some time it had a "ghost touch" going on. The phone would be sitting there, and then a page would scroll, or an app would open, or an email would open up without anyone touching it. That went away after a couple of updates. Now, the apps randomly close on you. We tried to send it in for repair/replacement, but Moto wants us to pay for shipping and a deposit. Nope. The device is under warranty, I should not have to pay for anything. Battery life was good to start, but now, it lasts about half of what it used to. To finish, we will be purchasing another device from a different manufacturer. This has been the worst mobile device we have ever owned.
1,...Shaking my head
1,This is junk!		Stay away!		I ordered ROSE GOLD, you see the box has a label that says ROSE GOLD what I got instead was an ugly, "gold" almost copper color.		This is something good expect to get from a quarter toy machine. Not good quality at all.		Very cheaply made. Flimsy. I wouldn't put my	Very expensive watch in this cheap case.		Stay away. Invest in a better case.		Looks NOTHING like the photos.		Sample provided for my evaluation and honest review.
1,Hard to manage, gets loosen after a while.
1,Only had it for a month and the corner of broken after using it even though it's a very nice case at least it should severe me much longer
1,Now that ive had this case for a few months ive noticed that my device heats up to the point that it becomes unuseable...i see that it has a 3 year warantee and hopefully poetic will honor that..ill keep you posted
1,Phone did not came unlocked, it is locked and I can't use it yet.
1,I was not impressed with this bluetooth at all.  I thought the ear bud was super uncomfortable and whenever I used it, whoever I was talking to constantly complained that I sounded "fuzzy" and that I was hard to understand.  It was very frustrating to use and I finally gave up and just threw this away.  I probably should have tried to return the item, but I played with it so long hoping to get it to work, that I was to tired to even try and return it for my money.  I would rather just use my headphones, they had a better quality than these!!!
1,Doesn't fit properly and comes up on the corners.
1,Kinda sucky had trouble applying it. When I finally did, the edges on the vertical sides of the phone were not adhering all the way down. I suppose because of the rounded edges.
1,note that this is actually a 'locked down' version of the phone, if you purchase direct from Google, the phone will work on GSM and CDMA, this phone is limited to GSM networks.
1,They arived broke
1,This thing is a piece of junk I had it for only a week and it had become unwaterproof I got the lifeproof a week later and it has the same call and sound quality as the siedio in my opinion the siedio is junk and the lifeproof nuud series is much better
1,Not durable at all.... After few days it cracked without any good reason... I didn't dropped the phone etc...
1,4 out of 5 of the plugs broke within the first week of use. The company did reach out to me and proved a means to replace my charger cables but never sent the cords!		Save your money and skip this product!
1,Looks nice, but I can't get the edges to wrap around the phone. I just got it. Don't know if it's been sitting on a shelf for years, and shrunk.
1,It never holds your phone up, the weight makes the phone always fall face down & the plastic grip/piece broke
1,No good.  Tossed it in the garbage 5 min after opening.  Spring in latch broke on the strap when I tried to clip the strap on.
1,my wife like the look and feel of the case. unfortunately, it only last 2 months of normal used. the sling felt apart. not to happy about it.
1,This case is lined with glitter paper. The outside is a rubber texture but the case is not really glitter, simply paper.
1,Doesn't work.  Stopped after a couple weeks.  Returned
1,cheap does not take your phone
1,It very clearly advertises a 1-foot product, but then the dimensions mention an 11.8 inch length.		The cord itself isn't even 9 inches, and the full length is indeed 11.8 inches.	I require a 1-foot cord, not a 9-inch one.		FALSE ADVERTISING FOR A PRODUCT I HAVE NO USE FOR.
1,This is a sturdy case but the card slots are so tight that you can only fit one card in at a time. Maybe 2 if you really try to squeeze it in there but then it's hard to get them back out.
1,2 stars because it charges my note 4 only 3 full cycles. The item is super heavy..... I wonder if others get 6 full charge cycles... .
1,Didnt last long before breaking.
1,Had problems with this unit when used with a shell installed on the phone it just sits on the dresser now.
1,This was literally just a sticker. So not worth the money. The picture makes it look like it's really detailes and dimensional. False advertising
1,Too difficult to placer and remover for big cellphones, I do not recomend for 5" ir bigger. Too muchas vibration.
1,Didn't fit the phone I bought it for and gets very hot when charging
1,Did not last long and was too cumbersome.
1,STOPPED CHARGING AFTER ABOUT A MONTH! WE NEVER OVER-CHARGED IT, WE FOLLOWED USER INSTRUCTIONS TO A T... VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS, EXPECTED MORE FROM AN OTTER BOX PRODUCT!		THIS CHARGER WAS GREAT WHILE IT LASTED, AND NOW THERE'S NO OPTION TO CONTACT SELLER IN MY ORDER HISTORY, SO WE'RE STUCK WITH A USELESS PIECE OF PLASTIC.
1,Looks good with a small footprint.  However, it is too light and not sticky enough, causing the stand to move around very easily.  Returned immediately.  Love my Spigen products, but this was not one of them.
1,Well I got this phone on time. Started using it and everything went well...but, lately the phone started to freeze and stops responding. ..so I did a factory reset...and things went well again...two days ago the phone started to randomly shut down and will not turn back on...until the battery is being taken out and replaced. Note: it was not the battery that needed charge because,  it was always above 60% charged. I think I will return this. Hope this was helpful to you future buyers.
1,I have purchased two of these products 7 months ago, and the product will not stay in the cd player (both of them).  The locking mechanism has lost its strength and the tension on the arm also weakened.  I could understand if it was just one of the products, but since it happened to both of them, I feel as if the product itself has been crafted with low quality materials. Also, the fit was less than satisfactory for both (even though it held). On my Lexus GS350, I had to put the unit upside down. It fit somewhat okay on the RX350 but it wasn't a perfect fit. This would be an excellent product if the following characteristics applied:	1. Bigger rubber pad for cd players with bigger slots	2. Stronger locking mechanism (or a completely different mechanism)	3. Arm with better durability (cannot hold an iPhone6S nor Note Edge anymore)	There has to be a way to address these concerns. Until then, I am sticking with the vent mounts...
1,item was not functional and was returned
1,Very uncomfortable
1,These stopped providing a charge to the tablets I bought them for very quickly and they also soon fell apart. They felt and looked great when I took them out of the package and if they'd kept working and hadn't busted apart, I would have been very happy with them.
1,Did not fit well
1,It is useless, won't fit fast any of my phone cases. And I can't go without some type of case while at the fire department. Very disappointed. Just sits in a drawer now
1,did not like the color
1,Cute case but it's already falling apart after 2 weeks. Bummer. On to the next case.
1,Touch functions did not work even though display powered up. Contacted seller and they wanted me to make a video of problem. Have replaced digitizers on numerous Samsung phones. Will not buy from this seller again.
1,I have to first say the Blackberry Passport Silver is a fine unit but not for me. After using a Blackberry Z30 for two years I felt it was time to upgrade. The following is the reason for returning the unit.		1- The Blackberry Passport Silver will not run all of my Z30 apps.	2- The Blackberry  Passport Silver  will not run my Audible.com books like my Z30 does.	3- My Blackberry  Passport Silver needs the unit to reboot several times a day.		My Blackberry Passport Silver rans on AT&T.		So with a heavy heart I returned my Blackberry  Passport Silver after using it for 30 days.
1,It's great. The silver clip/stand on the back is totally scratched within a month but that doesn't matter to me.  It holds only 1 credit card in the slide pocket and doesn't fall out. I have my driver's license inside the case as well and that makes it a bit tight and causes the case to engage my volume down button.  Frequently I notice that my phone is on silent because of it. But if you don't mind the scratched silver then it great.		Update: The silver clip/stand is plastic hinged and the hinge pin broke after 2 months.
1,Works, but not well, often gives error message. Plug only works one way. Inconsistent. Very cheap compared to Apple products, and would only recommend them as a spare or emergency for use.
1,Worked well with all devices, but only lasted a couple months before the boot split and the wires failed.
1,Plans r not good like lycamobile unlimited data,talk and txt for 23 with tax.
1,After ordering this case and putting it on one our company phones the user began complaining that the volume buttons wouldn't work because they were being held down (pressed in) by the case even though they don't appear to be at first glance. I tried several of the cases, all with the same result.	If you have a Verizon iPhone I wouldn't buy this case.
1,The case did not fit my RAZR MAXX HD phone. It has been returned. Otherwise, I think that I would have liked it.
1,There is one flaw in this phone that need to be fixed. The Camera will freeze once every 20 times... It can be very frustrated at time because you need to reboot the phone for it to work again. I have tried to resets it many times but nothing changed. I thought it was just a faulty on that one phone but even after an exchange with Amazon, the phone stills freezes here and there... very frustrating.... I think it would give it 4-5 stars if it doesn't freeze this often...	Other than this, the phone seems to be nice and function well.
1,Phone cover is ok except  the pink comes off on your fingers don't understand why tat would happen wouldn't buy it again
1,Not recommended. Cheaply made. Was returned immediately
1,UPDATED AFTER 3 YEARS  !!!!!!	After 3 years am updating this review now, such a long time right !!! Lol		I used this headset from time to time left it for few months and used it for another however am not a heavy duty user of headsets. All mentioned issues are solved after some firmware updates but i faced another one which is the SOUND QUALITY of MICROPHONE.		The sound quality is very bad compared to phone microphone actually i didn't notice unless my friends told me about that when i was talk to them using this headset. Every time i talk to them with this headset they ask me talk louder because they couldn't heard me well. Finally I moved to another brand (Jabra) TALK which is the basic model and i found an amazing sound quality to the receiver i wonder if really this headset contains 3 microphones ?????		After moving out from plantronics to jabra i became really addicted to use headset every day.		Now you will find the old review bellow, i don't want to delete it because it is a nice notes with 3 years old age 		The product is good but it is have a disadvantage points :-	Note :  All these Disadvantages after the latest firmware update 44 .		* On My Galaxy S3 , the Headset disconnected from time to time especially with long stand by mode . We should see nothing like this in such a well known company products. right ??		* It has not connected to 2nd generation Nokia phones , Either to iPhone 3G ? WHY ?!!		* I also bought the Voyager Bluetooth HD ( Previous Version ) Looks to me it works better than this one . even Some voice command feature But loss for many Essential features .		* Short USB cable , With no separated cable for charger like "Voyager Pro HD" Because we need length in charger cable Not USB cable.		* Some issues came with car kit charger some are not , WHY ?		Thanks		Good luck
1,It works to hold the phone....after that I am not liking it.	The band does not stretch to accommodate any flexing of my arm muscle.	This makes it uncomfortable.
1,I bought 6 total....3 of the 3 foot and 3 of the 6 foot.  Every single one of them failed within a matter of 2 months of use.  This company has a replacement policy, but honestly I didn't want anymore of these even if they were free
1,Colors were great. But it broke too easily. Crap.
1,I have not driven with the product but can foresee that it's pretty good.  The installation was pretty painless.  The one thing I would add to the other helpful posts is that you may need to adjust the clip orientation by loosening it (notice the Philips screw, loosen it till it allows the assembly to rotate freely) and when it's in place in the vent, tighten it.  In my case, the stabilizing bars sit at an angle which doesn't bother me.  My car is an Acura RL 2006 and I clipped it to the right vent in the center console.  I don't think it will be appropriate to fit in the left vent, center console.  I did not try to mount it in the left vent near the window because I want to be able to plug in the car charger when I am in GPS mode (too much wiring would wind up it's way over the steering and too messy).  Also, in landscape mode, it hides one of my buttons for passenger heat control which is not an issue for me but for you it might be.  These are nitpicks for a product that is designed to be universal so take it with a grain of salt.		Edit:  Broken, way too easily.  Dropping my review down to 2, sorry.	Edit 2:  I called the seller and he gave me half off credit after the warranty.  That was a great gesture and worth mentioning.  I just bought another one knowing it will probably last only one year but I like these.
1,Didn't fit.
1,It was either defective or it was not new. It lasted 1 week.
1,It's not a very good magnet at all. Not too sure why I even ordered this, it hardly keeps the flap cover connected to the other magnet at all. I would not buy again, and don't necessarily recommend this to anybody.		I am using this with a genuine Samsung S-View cover on my Galaxy Note 4.
1,Lost during the first week. Do not stay on good.
1,did fit well
1,not good
1,Nice holster; inadequate clip. Perfectly fits my Phone 6S in its LifeProof case; Velcro holds it securely and safely in the holster as it falls, slides, pops and slithers off my jeans pocket.
1,Stones fell off almost immediately.  Probably used this case for less than a week.  It's sitting in drawer but should be in the trash.  Much better cases out there......
1,doesn't work well
1,Flimsy and cheap could barley hold my samsung note 2.
1,Pretty bulky, and the mechanism that locks the case around the phone is extremely cheap.
1,Too complicated and risky to over use the adhesive.
1,Broken after 2 months. Made of cheap plastic.
1,Dropped it once and the case broke.
1,Update:  So I have had this installed in my truck for a long time now.  It works sometimes, but then it just doesn't work.  I can't tell you why, but it will work fine three or four times in a row and then just NOT work when you need it.  Its not a range issue, or a install issue, it's just a real piece of crap.  It was like rolling the dice every time I tried to use it.  Maybe I would get lucky and it would actually work.  I found myself using the keys half the time.  I pulled it out and replaced it with a very similar looking system from Amazon for $16.99 by Docooler.  It has worked every single time I have used it.  I am so happy when it works, and that is because this CamRom system is so terrible.  The harness is about the same too, I just had to move the pins around.		Old review:	All I really need is for it to connect two wires together when I hit the button to lock and unlock my truck.  I honestly don't think they could have less documentation if they tried.  It comes with a small piece of paper about 6"x4" and gives very little information.		I hooked it up to power and I can hear it clicking, but after spending an hour testing out the wires with a multi-meter I can't figure out what its doing.		I could probably make it work if I have a diagram of explanation of what this thing did when I hit the buttons.  Like ground this wire or pulse this wire 12v or connect these two wires, etc.  I got no clue what all this does so I am going to return it and try something else.
1,Not what I expected but of course should consider the price too.  Liked the color scheme but lacked the toughness of the case.  Very weak feel case.  thnx
1,Didn't work
1,Doesn't quite fit some devices right. Fits my S4 fine when not in a case, but won't go in with case on. I specifically bought a case with a wide cutout and this is the first cable I've had that doesn't fit. It also doesn't fit my kindle. It't like I'm trying to shove a baseball bit through a paper towel roll. Like the kindle port is too tight, or this is too big, I don't know, it just doesn't work.		It charges slow, this is due to length, once you get over about 10feet you lose some charge speed, nothing specific to this brand.		Also the full USB side came bent slightly when I got it.		I wasn't expecting much from a cheap generic cable, but it still managed to disappoint me a bit.
1,I chose this phone, for your presentation.		but it is a bad investment because it is much gaskets when I use the wifi and occasionally turns itself off in my pocket.		would not recommend this unit to anyone.	seller does not have a good customer service.
1,It was all scratch
1,DX2 Much better than original Droid A855	Rev: 11-29-2012a		The good:	-- This phone/pda is much better that the original Droid (A855) that I had for two months, that older phone sux.	-- The Droid X2 (DX2) is much faster, seems more refined, less buggy.  The screen is just big enough.	-- Hidden treasure: FM broadcast receiver works very-very good. Uses your provided headphones (requires them to work, its the antenna), to receive FM.  This is the best FM receiver I own?  The Bandwith seems to very as signal quality varies, the result is there is much less static. And has very good fidelity.  The GUI need more attention, like push button access to the favorites, signal strength meter (RSSI) and such. Radio work wonderfully...	Over all I'm more happy with this Droid X2. It would get 4-stars, if not for all the minor problems (all bad software, related, see below)...		The bad:	-- I had to clear all cash, 3 times, and reset to original factory setting once (erase everything and start over (this held a lot))...	-- Music player skips, at least once per song, some program is interrupting or some thing??? *1	-- Phone crashers for no apparent reason. Seems to be excessive CPU usage problem. Just after closing Google maps or other programs.  90% of the time this is only solved by removing the battery, nothing else fixes this problem.	-- Clock is completely cell network based. If the battery is removed, the clock cant be set without turning on the cell radio, even if you have WiFi with a clock sync program running (i use airplane mode, at home, so the battery don't die overnight, as I have no cell service where I live).	-- I don't like Google, any more.  It seems, I have troubles with them constantly (cant sync phone book as stated on their web site. maps crashing, Goggle application crashing (most of this was on the A855). And no one to report this too and get help (no customer support)).	-- After I got the dock, "Motorola" tries to force an additional computer (drivers) update (other than the standard USB ones), if you download it, each time you connect to the computer, three folders open.  One is the Motorola drivers folder and this seems to make a browser window open and it connect to the internet, to a Verizon wirelesses backup service, a video self starts, advertising a service I don't want or need. Apparently I have to Root the phone, to remove this nag-ware from the phone, in order to make it stop. Work around (sorta): And and remove programs, and remove the offending Motorola folder. The third folder still opens, after docking, but no internet sales video starts.	-- The info area at the top of the phone is supper tiny and there seems to be no setting to make it bigger.	-- The signal strength bars, has just 4 bars, instead of the standard 5, and is hard to see.  Having no signal, is common where I live, and the no signal looks, like full bars.	-- The info area messages comes and goes, faster than I can read (same area).	-- GPS won't actually turn on, when selected (using maps), if the cellular service is turned off.  The symbol shows up, but not worke.  The work around is: Turn on cellular, then GPS, then turn cell back off, to make GPS work.  Even still some times the GPS just won't work.  THen it takes a power off-on reset. Sometimes this dose not work and you need to do the remove the battery reset, and reinstall the battery, to restart the GPS...	-- Screen timeout dose not apparently apply to wake up screen and sometimes the screen goes to sleep, as I'm trying to inter the password or shut the phone off, or set it into to airplane mode.	-- There is a lot of data consuming bloat-ware on the phone and rooting is the only solution is to remove. This stuff also kills memory and slows the phone as sum of it, starts and runs despite that I'm not using it. There is way too much trash, supplied by Verizon, on this phone.	-- Android/ Google. I'm not liking the disclaimers, that accompanies 98% of all the applications. One example: Why dose a mapping program, need to take pictures or record sound, or can even make phone calls, without user intervention???  This is in may of the disclaimers, when you download software to the phone from the Google Play Store - Why???	-- Weird battery removal process, and poorly described. A piece of plastic (red) label is used to pry up the battery. It exceptionally unprofessional - a cheap solution. I expect it will fail (tare), making imposable to remove the battery, over time. I use my phone enough, I use several batteries, and even one a separate aftermarket charger, to charge batteries out of the phone. I own 4 batteries, one of the original 1500mAh battery, the other 3 are aftermarket BH5X that is 1900mAh, I got from ebay. All are the standard thin, non-fat (dose not take a different battery door), battery.		Inclusion:	As you can see, I have many somewhat minor issues with the phone. I hate Apple, so what other choices are there. None.  It's much like Voting, its the choice of the least-bad solution, I guess...		Cell provider:	Page plus, $55 get you 2 GB data and unlimited talk and text...		De:	Mr. RF.
1,FELL A PART AFTER 2 MONTHS
1,There's no premium and there's no leather. Bag is fake leather, aka plastic / vinyl. The frame is made of plastic as well. I promptly returned it two days after it arrived. It may look nice. .. but it feels cheap.
1,Product seemed cheap and actually used, I returned it before use
1,Well, not even half a day with this cover and it's already shattered. New record for me :(		Before it shattered I was already having issues with touch sensitivity near both edges.
1,After opening this package I knew then that this was not going to be good. Now I purchased this product with caution after reading the reviews I should have listened to my head. I really wanted them to be wrong. Once you put it together big and bulky , would not charge, it would not hold this big phone. Does this company realize that they recommended this product for a Galaxy note. The weight of my phone pulled this thing out the cigarette lighter 3 times. Finally I said that enough, and returned it.	This is why I would recommend Amazon. As long as you follow the proper steps, they will always do good by you. Please discontinue this crap.
1,Please note that I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, but rest assured that my review is fair and honest. This is a good looking case and the fit and finish is pretty good.		However, it's important to point out that this case has a huge design flaw.  There is no hole for the microphone on the top part of the phone.  Not sure why this design flaw was not addressed before production.  As a result, it's hard to recommend this case.
1,This post must stick out like a sore thumb in an apparent sea of favorable reviews. The MediaDevil Nano To Micro SIM adapter did not fit my T-Mobile Nano SIM. The slot is juuust a tiny tiny smidge too small, -- when placed in the slot, the T-Mobile SIM card to juts up so much it won't slide into the SIM slot of the phone. So much for being "CNC machined." ETA: Ah, now I see other T-Mobile users complaining about the poor fit as well. If you are looking for a T-Mobile SIM card adapter, you will do well to avoid this product.
1,This was my second attempt at trying to get a screen protector to fit my S7 correctly and without hassle.  This attempt failed.  This screen protector is extremely difficult to apply since it is so limp and has no firmness to it.  There also aren't any tabs that normally come with screen protectors that provide guidance and can be held while laying down the protector.		As I tried to place it evenly over my screen it stuck on almost immediately and I had to lift it and reapply which caused bubbles and unsightly wrinkles.  At that point I became frustrated and just threw it out.  Its unfortunate because its a wide fit, almost edge to edge.  Another downside about this protector is that it is not clear.  It has a cloudy appearance which does not give the clearest view.  It definitely obstructs the clarity.		After that happened with the front I opted not to try to apply the protector on the back of my phone.  I was also hesitant to do so for fear that it may possibly remove the paint if I decided I didn't like it and wanted to remove it.  Plus my phone is always in a case anyway.
1,Horrible
1,very cheap wish can return but not worth the time and effort
1,This review is for a unit purchased from iParts Outlet... Definitely NOT original Samsung! I tested the unit as instructed to insure that it was working. I proceeded to transfer all my components and was pleased with how quickly things were going. I got everything transferred into the new unit, go to connect the final cable (the display cable) only to discover the cable does not line up properly with the motherboard on my I337 Galaxy S4. Needless to say I am not pleased with this part and am hoping my return goes smoothly. I'm wishing I had just paid the extra to find a local repair shop! :(
1,This unit has some nice features such as the way text messages are displayed and the calls log. Unfortunately, it crashes at least two or three times a day. But yesterday it crashed and did not restart, so I lost all my new contacts, important messages, and notes. I would like to return it for a refund or better unit, if at all possible?! It does not load pictures quickly and is rather slow. Calls often did not go through on tyhe first attempt. All in all, I've given-up on phablets as all three I tried did not operate as well as my three-year-old HTC Inspire. The customer-service was not very good and my simple questions were not answered quickly or accurately. (I had to call Amazon.com customer-service to get answers for simple questions such as; "Is it a 3-G phone right out of the box"? All in all, stay away from phablets and this company or proceed at your peril!
1,Decent Bluetooth speakerphone for your car. Easy to set up. But the fm transmitting quality is not good. I have used a few different devices like this, and this one has very low quality broadcast signal. In that I mean the sound reproduction when connected via Bluetooth or directly through the headphone jack is very poor. No bass, no treble, just a decent responding middle.		Before anybody comment saying it's using fm, so it will not sound like CD. I know that. But it should not sound like an 1st gen fm broadcaster. That what it sounds like. When no cars came with aux jacks from the factory and you had no choice. I have tried no-name brands from Target that sounds better than this. I'm not sending it back because it was cheap and I can give it to someone that wouldn't care how out it sounds because they are desperate and/or haven't seen better versions.
1,Fit and finish are fine, although corners started to wear out in just few weeks. Its also not easy to put on and take off and every time you do, it scratches the phone itself. It hasn't left any marks on phone yet, but I know it will because edges are pretty sharp. Can't recommend this.
1,Received May 23rd and both have stopped working already
1,Completely sucks for charging a phone in the car.  No idea if I just got a bad one or not but it was so bad at charging I had to replace it.
1,Chips and smudges, enough said
1,Cheap look and the head was loose... tend to fall down.
1,This cable didn't seem very secure in the port in my phone when I first started using the cable. I have had the cable for less than a month, and the black nylon covering has already come off near the connector, and the cable has already completely frayed to exposed wires. This cable also came with a velcro strap that was not worth any time. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a cable.		Update 3/7/17: iOrange-E reached out to me and sent me a replacement cable. While it wasn't in a preferable color it's still great that they replaced it. So far I have not had the same durability issues yet. Updating from 2 to 3 stars for now. If the cable is able to last longer I will be updating my rating.		Update 4/9/17: The replacement cable has also failed in a very similar fashion as the last one. I cannot recommend this cable considering I have now gone through two example that both failed in the same way. I'm not exactly keen on risking shorting with these new cables.
1,Not worth the money. The phone very easily overheats. One on the second day.
1,I got this for my S5.. Almost impossible to get in, felt like i was almost going to damage my phone.. Then my volume n lock screen buttons were impossible to press.  I ended up just cutting out the metal wire and then it was easier to work with.  The charger fits through well, but my headphones couldn't get all the way in.  I just glued the bear to another case of mine that i didn't really like (drying right now) its still a really cute concept, my bear wasn't falling apart it seemed decent.. Just a bad design, not user friendly with phone
1,Its doesn't fit tight and it doesn't seem like it would protect my phone very much. I don't use it.
1,Bad Quality material and edges. Very dissapointing.
1,This case is okay except it covers the microphone where no body can hear me when I am talking to them. I suppose I can cut another hole so that it works better. I have no problem with the fit other than it does cover the microphone.		I would not buy this case for the T-Mobil MyTouch 4g... spend a bit more money and get one that actually fits your phone.
1,Item does a nice job with extra cord storage, but it is a bit bulky for travel.  In addition, there is not hinge to help hold your cord at a 90 degree angle for nightstand mode, and unless you have everything positioned exactly right, it will try to flop back off of your watch.  I have not had issues with my watch falling off of the silicone stand, but I could see how that could occur easily when trying to use nightstand mode.
1,made screen buttons weird color
1,unsafe
1,If i can put 0 stars i would!!!
1,I bought this thinking it would be great to have a built in stand for my phone but the stand is loose and will not lay flush to the phone when not in use. This makes it difficult when putting the phone in a mount because the stand gets in the way. Doesn't seem unreasonable to make this a flush stand.
1,Good
1,Fantastic phone, currently using it with Ting on their TMobile GSM network.		EDIT: I had to lower my rating by two stars.  Reason: This phone simply will not keep a signal. I was sold the xt1039 European model of this phone.  I am very disappointed with this.		Difference between the 1039 and the 1045:	http://www.phonemore.com/compare/phones/motorola-moto-g-4g-xt1045-vs-motorola-moto-g-4g-xt1039/1686067		I never connect to LTE despite being in an area that is flooded with LTE.  At most I get HSPA+, and this is disappointing as well.  A little bit faster than Edge, but not much.  Super slow.		Unfortunately, I dropped the phone and it has a ding in it now.  But, I feel duped.  Amazon should require that the exact model of the phone be displayed on the list.  Marking every moto g as universal when they aren't is irresponsible and borderline shady.
1,Not oem product.  It started  chipping  during the second week of use. I installed my oem back afterwards. Thanks
1,This cable lasted only two weeks, save your money and look for other vendor. So save your money and look for other vendor to buy.
1,This case ended up being a disappointment. The ring was constantly unsnapping and the rubber around the case became loose and fragile. I had to order another case. Do not recommend
1,I returned this for a refund.	It was flimsy.	It did not stay up.	The light was coming off right when unboxed.	There are sections in the back of the devise where the sides do not meet.	This leaves a way for light to escape and come in not to mention back then is not solid
1,too big
1,Feels cheaply made. You get what you pay for. But it serves its purpose for me.
1,Disclaimer - I have received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.		Not bad at all. The wireless charging functionality is very nice and convenient. No need to fiddle around with cables to connect with - just place the phone on the charging pad and both the phone and the case will charge. I haven't noticed any issues with charging time as I usually charge it overnight, but the fact that I can use the phone the entire day without worrying about where the nearest outlet is makes life so much more simple. My only wish was that instead of the microUSB port, it offered the lightning cable port, so that I don't need to worry about carrying different cables (not that I use the micro-USB port often). The charging base seems like cheap material, though they do a good job of making it look nice with the stainless steel look. The one issue I noticed with the charging pad was that even the smallest of particles can prevent the case/phone from charging. Somehow a bread crumb appeared in the middle of the pad and while the leads on the case were free to link with the pad, the small crumb  created a lever, preventing one of the leads from contacting the pad by less than a centimeter. This distance was large enough to prevent the case from charging. Not sure if that's a minor flaw in the design or if that's just a downside to wireless charging, but I'll be sure to keep my charging pad and case crumb-less from now on. One thing I was confused about regarding the case design was the speaker ports. I noticed that it aims front towards the user, redirecting the downward produced sound by the phone. I think this is a fantastic idea, but I realized that I wasn't sure if the sound was only coming from the front facing speaker holes of the case because I would still hear sound from the phone even if I covered the holes. One final gripe I have with this product is that the wireless charging is its own proprietary technology and doesn't follow the Qi standard. This limits me to buying a charging pad from uNu only.		Overall, I'm happy with this case.		UPDATE 4 months later - 05/08/2016	The product began to deteriorate over the past four months that I've had it. Because the wireless charging capability is so convenient, I would seldom use the microUSB charger, even though it would charge faster with the wired connection. I would only use the microUSB connection to sync the phone with iTunes/transfer photos from the phone to my computer. However, it began to not connect to the computer to sync, but would still power the case. A few weeks after that, the port just completely stopped working both in terms of syncing and charging. Now I can only charge the phone through the wireless connection, which is a huge hassle when I'm traveling. In addition, it seems that it tends to drain the battery of my phone much faster now, making it even more frustrating to use every day since I actually end up having to charge the phone and the case multiple times a day, when, in the beginning, I barely would need to charge both every day.		Overall, the product started out strong and I was a very happy user. But after a month, it began to show its flaws and things only got worse from there. Unless I have a defective product, I would highly recommend that you DO NOT purchase this product.
1,Tried to use this thing for a while (few months) Impossible to get the phone in/out there with one hand. Doesn't stay on window.
1,the product was shipped useless and did not know how to express this opinion's why I did not before, I would not do business with other Vesz estat.........
1,The hard part of the case cracked in several places after a few months. It is very thin so once it starts cracking, it is liable to split apart and be useless very soon. I dropped it a couple times but nothing severe, only a few feet on carpet. Also very difficult to remove. And the glass backing traps air against the back of the phone. So it's meant to show off the backside but instead you just see a bunch of flat bubbles with the rainbow effect. I still used it for several months and it served me well until the cracks became too severe. I wised up and got a battery case instead, which I recommend to anybody who has this phone.
1,Good
1,I really like the bling but I can not use it. It will not fit my phone right. It is to thick for you to be able to touch the side buttons. Very disappointed.
1,It was extremely hard to put on.  I was sent a replacement to try again and again a fail.
1,I really wanted to like this product - it is well engineered, the accessories are well thought-out, and the weight is perfect. Unfortunately, the loop is too small, so no matter the size of the earpiece, it was sitting a half-inch too far up my ear and was ridiculously uncomfortable.
1,I have dropped my phone every which way dozens of times without issue in previous inexpensive off brand case and felt that spending the extra for an otter box when i decided to keep the phone another year would be a good investment.  Was pleased at how nice the case looks on my phone until out slipped out of my pocket from a seated position, fell less than 2 feet onto its corner and my whole screen shattered. No good at all.
1,The product itself sounds like a great idea; a 2 piece bumper, with different colors.  What isn't so great is how loose it feels when it's installed on the phone.  Way too much "wiggle" room.  The material itself feels like cheap plastic, so for over $20, it's not a good deal.  The screen protectors for the front and rear are actually pretty good, so since it's included, that's a good bonus.  But if you're looking for a better feeling, better quality bumper, look elsewhere.  I was thinking of purchasing their Neo Hybrid EX Slim, but my better judgement is telling me to look elsewhere.  If i hadn't used the screen protectors, I would try to return this Linear EX.
1,After waiting 24 hours for the adhesive to bond to the glass surface, I put on my Seidio two-piece case.  Within an hour, the edges of the screen protector began lifting off the screen.  This is easily noticeable when texting or selecting icons near any edge because the glass protector clicks as it makes contact again with the phone's screen.  Within a two days, it had lifted so far off the screen that it cracked while I was texting.  So far, I'm seeing that all of the screen protectors for the Galaxy S7 have this same problem including the one made by Zagg.
1,The case looks great and is nice and thin, not adding a lot of bulk to your pocket.  I soaked my case in water ,using a weight to keep it down, before installing my phone in the case.  No leaks and seemed to be just fine.  Working in the yard one day it started to rain and I was away from where I had left my phone lay.  I got to my phone as soon as I could and when I picked it up there was water in between the phone and the case, on both sides.  Dried my phone in rice and it seems fine.  Will not trust this case again.
1,i bought this phone for my daughter for when she had sleepovers and school functions. However i thought i was safe with the pay as you go... we bought a $10.00 card for her, and used it a few times... still had a balance, however the fine print said that it uses $.35 per day if you use the phone or NOT. Thus sucked up our $10.00. When I called to place money on the card a couple of months later, found out that since we have not used the phone in over 30 days, and the account had a balance of 0 for 30 days, we had to buy a new sim card costing $9.95 plus pay for extra minutes. This IS NOT WORTH IT! You are better off adding a family line at $9.95 a month, and using your AT&T or T-mobile sim card and plan. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME like i did! Also their customer service SUCKS... For a plan designed for kids, the service is designed to trap you to keep pouring money into their account, not as an alternative family friendly phone for kids.
1,It's better to buy one screen protector from a trusted brand, than six from an unknown brand. These things scratch so easily that I actually went through the protectors very quickly. They do protect the screen well, but at the cost of replacing them regularly, which is a huge hassle. I would not recommend.
1,Major security issues with this phone. Amazon has pulled them from there shelves. Now I will have to purchase a new phone to replace this on my dime !!!!!!
1,Looking at the picture the case looks really elegant. But upon receiving it it isn't that good. the material is very different from the picture. But it looks strong.
1,products just don't charge iPhones for very long.  Almost like the wiring inside, burns up or something.
1,The car charger and the wall charger just suck. The microusb end never fits snugly in any of our phones/headset, it doesn't continuously charge. Those are its only functions and it fails miserably.
1,I have owned about six silicone covers over the years for various Ipods and Iphones and this is the worst one yet. It's very loose, to the point that it bunches up in your hand when you pick it up. Access to the buttons is awful because the opening around the buttons are raised. Access to the vibrating switch is null, I have to remove that corner of the case to get to the switch. I have recently found that a store called 5 Below (everything for under $5) sells silicon cases for $5, and being that I paid over $4 with shipping, I feel that I just threw away $5.
1,I followed the directions exactly and used all three screen with terrible results. The main issue is that the corners of the screen protector, where the cameral and phone speaker are located, are curled up slightly, so they never adhere to the screen. Since that is not adhered, it gets caught on anything when putting in one's pocket and the whole thing is ruined. Yes, I made sure it didn't go over the edge of the glass onto the plastic, and yes I used the rubber bands and adhesive hinges. I was willing to live with the inevitable bubbles from dust but the corners being bent make this just a piece of trash.
1,I personally didn't like it and it was much lighter then the picture
1,too thick to access the charger port slippery
1,It was okay i really didn't like it. It broke in like 1week
1,i had to return it and purche another
1,Not a great bc little water in waterproof wit new phone. Not safe like in 95 percent... but really good for rainy day
1,I've been riding with my smart phone in my jersey pocket for the last couple of years. I've been wanting a case for awhile, but was too lazy to get it.		Finally got my hands on this one and have to say it does the job, but not much more.		Pros:	Stays on the bike...mounted vertically (Though the mounting isn't all that solid nor is the slide on holding piece. It's supposed to lock in place, but does not)	Phone screen is very easy to work with.	Plug-ins, outputs are accesible		Cons (after 4 rides of 15-25miles each on pleasant days):	Blue rubber top and bottoms work themselves loose	Hard to access the power button on top (Even after working with the foam inserts to adjust location of the phone inside the unit)	Mounting is questionable. Wouldn't use it horizontally. It relies on zip-tie straps	Routine difficulties getting the case to lock shut (but stayed shut once closed)		Overall, I wouldn't trust this case in the rain beyond a light sprinkle. Nor would I use it for a more bumpy ride. It does what I need it too, but at a $70 price point is grossly overprice, in my opinion.
1,This charger is very slow and it broke within a month. When I say broke, it literally broke as the plug remained in the wall outlet and body was hanging off the wall. If you are looking for a rapid charger, look for other options.
1,Fits fine, but broke after the phone fell off my lap in the living room. Was hoping for something a little more durable.
1,I've tried a number of iPhone wallet cases and this one is probably the worst one.  The materials feel very cheap and the footprint of the case is much larger than it needs to be.		I would recommend the StilGut "Talis" Wallet, Book Type Genuine Leather Case for Apple iPhone 5 & iPhone 5s:	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CJAP1V2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1		It is heads and shoulders above the Navor case.
1,I bought this phone because it had WiFi capability but did not require a data plan commitment.  I did use the phone for 3 months and it did not automatically access the 3G network without my initiating the access.  The phone operates on Windows CE and is sync'd perfectly with my outlook calendar.  I was also able to easily access available wifi spots to download my email when away from home.		The main gripe I have with this device is that it is a terrible phone! My previous phone was a RAZR and I verified that where the RAZR had 2 to 3 bars of signal, the Incite showed no carrier.  Many people also commented that it was hard to hear me when I used the Incite. The BIGGEST PROBLEM, however, was that about 20% of the time, the phone would not ring on incoming calls!  While standing next to me, I had someone call me.  Out of 10 calls, 2 did not ring the phone and the caller received voice mail after 6-7 rings.  Final gripe is that the phone would lock up or turn itself off every day or 2.		To place a call you need to press:  Unlock; Unlock; Phone icon; Dial number which you have to look at since there are no physical keys.  If you are in bright sunlight this is a real problem.  It doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but EVERY action requires multiple button presses.  Worse, the icons are so small and close that you often have to try multiple times to get to the function you wanted.  I was prepared for the touch screen problems that had been reported by others, but it was much more of a hassle than I expected.		Overall, the incite is not quite as useful as my HP PDA and it is certainly not a replacement for my RAZR phone.  It is now sitting in a desk drawer and I'm back to my old phone.
1,This cracked after 2 weeks of use. Do not waste your money!
1,Broke in 3 days.  Not very durable.
1,your better off taking your tablet to somewhere that will put it on for you, i ruined both of mine trying to apply it with the instructions... ehhh... didn't really work well... too many bubbles and retry's. i can do phones and smart watches and other smallish things but this is too much surface area.
1,estafa
1,Originally, I thought it might be the HTC 10 smartphone I was using, but now that I have a new LG V20 smartphone, and the same problem persists, I have to think it is the headset itself. I can pick up a call OK, by tapping the button on the headset, but the instant I do, the headset DROPS the Bluetooth connection back to the phone. Now, the whole point of one of these things is to be able to handle calls without touching your phone, right? So what good is it if I have to stop, dig the phone out of my pocket, unlock the screen, and tap the Bluetooth button to make it re-connect with the headset (which it faithfully does every time) before the calling party can hear me??? :(		Other than that, which is a good enough reason to have returned this product had it happened often enough within the first 30 days, the headset works well, except that I've never been able to get it to voice dial either. But I don't use that feature very often.		Bottom line.........you might want to keep looking for a better headset if you are considering this one.
1,I wasn't like my case when it coming it look hungry  anyway thank you
1,cheaply made, but served its purpose
1,I bought 3 battery cases including 2 Fusion and 1 Defender Air. The Defender Air and one Fusion were stopped working after 6 months. When the Defender Air case was broken, Maxboost sent me a replacement. The replacement was also broken after the first charge. 3 defective cases I received has the same problem. The USB connector was stopped working after a while.  My personal experience, STAY AWAY if you don't want to be headache later. This case has very low  product quality.		Regarding Maxboost customer service, it is another cause of headache. Firstly, they don't have customer service phone contact. All communication must go thru their emails. In other words, it is a slow communication and  you will give up if they don't want to serve you.  Although they promise that they will reply your email within 1 business day in every email they send out, they won't keep their promise. From their emails that I received , it took 2-3 days for them to respond an email.		Secondly, they keep repeated asking you for the same information you already provided like a reset. For instance in my situation, they requested me to return the defective cases before they send out the replacements. After they received the return, they asked me the model and color for the replacement. I responded with all information. Today, they asked me again regarding the model and the color for the replacement. Ridiculously, they also asked me to send in the defective cases which they already received. It is like they don't care what you  provided them. How stressful is that?
1,Only came with 3 I bought a 5 pack
1,Doesn't attach firmly on the vent.
1,Stop working after 2 months
1,The item bought does not hold charge. It did not last very long and there is no recourse for this defective item
1,Cloudy and bubbles.
1,Doesn't cover my iPhone screen edge to edge, plus the description of "bubble free" did not turn out to be true, even after following the installation instructions. Not too happy with this purchase. Will be buying something else to replace it.
1,Touch screen stop working after a week this is the 3rd and final htc product I will buy stay away from they seem to be rushing all kinds of phones out instead on focusing on just a few ...
1,When looking at this product remember you get what you pay for.  Product doesn't hold up and rubber stars falling off quickly and glass cover cheaply made.
1,This did not come with the wall plug. It's just the unit so I am probably returning or finding a plug that will work to attache to the wall socket.
1,Bought these with the wall charger. Didn't fit into the devices.  Threw them out also.  Never again will I purchase after market accessories for my devices.
1,No good
1,As other reviewers had said... I purchased this for my iPhone 4... Installation wasn't too bad... I liked the spray and squeegee system as it let you reposition it... somehow there are some brown spots IN the screen protector itself (dirt?) even though I followed all the directions (washing hands with soap and applying the solution to the finger tips).  I realize they offer free replacements but I think I will have to chalk it up to an impulse buy and just throw it away.  The screen is too tacky to comfortably slide a finger over.  Also as another reviewer said, the edges of the screen protector are peeled up by a case and will not stick down.  I would imagine at least half of all people with screen protectors would want to put a case on their phone too so the design itself is useless (if the screen protector was cut slightly shorter maybe it wouldn't peel?) but for this much money it should be flawless! On the plus side the material is pretty much indestructible as described... but I will never buy one of their products again nor would I suggest a friend or enemy do so...
1,I like the fact that you can position your phone at any angle, and rotate it too. That being said this bike mount holder is not very will made.  It is 100% plastic. The part which holds your phone falls of VERY easily, and if not for the stretchable cord, one could lose their expensive phone the first time they ride. I wound up "crazy gluing" the part the phone clamps to, to the base it clips into. This prevents the phone from ever being able to move, and still allows it to rotate freely. I would not recommend this product simply because there are many others out there to try. Why buy something guaranteed not to work right.
1,I ordered one but some how got changed for two. Tried to use them and  magnet was not strong enough for 7+. Also could not get the magnet to stick so had to super glue it down. Guess they charge you for 2 because it takes both to hold your phone
1,Fits great on CD player. But cheap metal plates. Too expensive for what it's. Overpriced
1,I got the product on time. The case is as described. I started using the case almost 1 week ago. It was easy to get the phone inside the case. It fits my Google Nexus 5 perfectly.		Yesterday, one of the those rubber things covering the corners just fell off somewhere (it is lost) and now I can see now a hole showing one of the corners of the phone.		The cover for the power socket is not flexible enough to open in order to plug in the the charger and does not also return to place easily once the charger is disconnected.		In all, it looks rugged enough to safeguard my phone but I think now that looks can be deceiving. And I am very disappointed at the fact that one of the rubber corners fell off in less than a week of using the case. It makes me wonder what will happen after a month of use.		Replacing the case isn't an option for me as I travel around a lot (for example right now I am some 7000 miles away in the middle east and with no cost effective way to send the case back unless I send it by regular mail which will ages back and forth). I would appreciate if i-Blason can send me a replacement set for those rubber things at the corners with the instructions as to how to put it in place.
1,very low quality , not same as product photos .	not happy at all .
1,I fail to understand the high ratings for this headset. I dislike it.		While sound quality was quite good, there are several physical attributes that made it less appealing to me.		Even with the smallest earpiece, it is uncomfortable in the ear canal. It is bulky, and awkward when worn with eyeglasses or sunglasses. The power switch is difficult to use as well. I can't really think of anything I like about it.		I thought it was a decent price at $42, but the $28 Motorola H500 is a no-brainer when compared to this headset.
1,As some of the previous 'real' reviewers pointed out, there is nothing special about this case that warrants a 5 star rating. It is your average TPU case with a dark back panel. That being said there is a significant drawback to this case if you want your case to look nice as I do. The back of this case is almost like a mirror and hence it is a fingerprint magnet. You cannot keep it clean and shiny. As soon as I clean it, it attracts fingerprint. So unless you are using gloves to handle your phone, the case is NOT going to look nice.
1,Dead spot caused by magnet in the kick stand is not fixed. They simply put scotch tape over the magnets as a fix.  Just bought 2 cases and I'm in the process of trying to get a refund.
1,2 stars are solely for the fact that it does indeed work electrically, although I can't 100% vouch for this. When I first plugged in my iPhone 6S, it began charging then it just blanked out. I had to do a force restart (home button and power button until the apple logo pops up) and haven't had issue since, but it did initially scare me. Since then though, it has been charging my iPad mini 2 and iPhone just fine.		The micro USB charging works well too. My Galaxy S7 edge goes from 30% to 100% in less than 2 hours, so not Quick Chage 2.0 speed, but faster than from a usual 5V1A wall charger (i.e. Apple iPhone charger).		So why no more than 2 stars? Well the BUILD of this thing is terrible. The adapter falls off so easily, so badly that when I'm charging an Apple product I can't even move it around without the tip falling off the micro USB end. Then on top of that, when I'm charging my Galaxy S7, the plastic chain is so soft and loose that it doesn't even hold the adapter on the chain. I've already had to phish through my sofa a number of times because it's fallen off so easily.		See photos as well. I'm not messing with these pieces rigorously; it just falls off with me using one hand.
1,Is a very good case, but instead of receiving the case for iPhone 8, I got the iPhone 6plus case.
1,Blu is Blue !! Cheap phones and have very little space left after Android is installed. You maybe can take 1 picture or 1 app. Must buy a SD Card and then figure out in Chinese how to teach the phone to auto move them over. You can buy these things anywhere. Walmart, Ebay Target etc. basically all the same price. I never want another. Good only if you simply want to send and receive a call and have a decent looking Smart Phone that won't do jack without the added dollars for the SD Card.		Their more expensive phones are some better but then your getting into a good Samsung price.
1,Couple weeks and it broked.
1,***updated review:  i was contacted by the company and they offered a 30% refund.  While I appreciate the offer this doesnt fix the issues I was having.  I swirched protectors and the sensitivity issues are gone.  Additionally, when I had this protector on it was interfering with the case I had making it difficult to push the buttons.  This problem is gone now as well.		Protector is not very sensitive, especially at the edges.  This cause you to really have to push hard for some commands.
1,Right out the gate I ordered the Metallic one. There are two kinds. Maybe the other is better. I've ordered so many of these cases over the years with no problem. But this is easily the most slippery thing I've ever held honest to God. Quality is amazing. Look is amazing but for a case it doesn't help if it slips out of my hands constantly.y wife ordered their other material. Hopefully that will be like the old ones.
1,Cute ooking but poorly made broke in 3days
1,Difficult to apply. Laborious. Threw out .  Using water on phone just doesnt seem right.  Might retrieve and ask for refund.
1,The item was defective. Screen kept raising up and buttons were not working on my iphone 6 touchscreen.
1,Broke after two months
1,Broke
1,Phone had terrible reception. Had to return it, wasting time and energy.
1,Just got it for a backpbackpackingaking trip in Sierras in high altitude climbing trip. It seemed nice, rugged andcompact and I had returned other bigger and more expensive products like Zero7. From the beginning it was working erratically on my Motorola HD Maxx phone. When charging the phone it would force it to turn on and would not allow it to be shut off. Even under the ideal conditions, full bright sun, and minimal phone use, it could not keep up charging the phone battery while in use. I will perhaps, send it back, but do not see anything similar in size on market right now so I might keep it for the emergency purposes as it will recharge your phone eventually if it's not used for a day or so.
1,The audio plug opening on the case is on the opposite side of where it is on the phone itself.  Also, the opening cutout in the back of the case for the camera lens obstructs the flash.  Thirdly, the case is a tad loose-fitting, although the quality of the rubber and plastic are good.
1,Literally ripped in just over a month. Still in pristine condition, just ripped right at the belt holster on the right side. Buyer beware.
1,Worst battery I have ever purchased. It needs charging after only a couple of hours of very limited usage!!
1,Charges didn't work after a few usages.
1,Update: wrote this review after I purchased this. Worked great first year and a half. Light use, only 2 items on charge at any time. Two ports  are Qualcomm 2.0. Started using it recently to charge my LGv10 as its Qualcomm , after 6 montgs it started getting hot and smoked like it was going to catch fire. Now the blue ports don't work and afraid to use it for the remaining regular ports. Less than 2 years of very light use, this shoildnt happen.  Going with another brand. Anker.		Old review : Seriously, stop wasting time doing the research, I've done it. You have a $550 or more cell and want to buy a $25 or less fast charger?  Save yourself time money and aggravation, THIS IS THE CHARGER TO GET, PERIOD! Great quality, doesn't plug in your wall, feels rugged and solid, Qualcomm Quick Charge. Don't trust your new cell or tablet to anything else. Why risk it to save $10 or $15 bucks? Better than the popular name brand Ank in my opinion.		Know what didn't you get? Contact me and I'll set you straight.  Best charger I've ever owned, PERIOD and I don't own stock or have no afiliation with them. I tell it like it is.
1,Case gets dirty very easily and does not clean.
1,This product did not look brand new, it had some sings of use. Also the cord was to short.
1,1. Received damage.	2. Doesn't fit to iphone 5	3. I applied for return and it got approved but then i realized that i will receive only $1.68 (and wasted shipping charge $2.88)and on top of that i have to pay the mail charge.	4. Pointless to return the product.	5. The material is so bad that if the phone falls any hard surface from low height then the case is going to break.		Advice -	1. Not to buy this product	2. When ever you buy this kind of things make sure you look for free shipping.	3. Silicon case is always good .	4. Hard case or rubberized case are not worth.
1,used battery not the same brand
1,5 stars for volume. I would buy 2 or 3 of these headsets if volume was key. Unfortunately this headset is terrible functionally.		Flakey connections on almost all important calls. Headset Does not stay associated with initial connection. Have to manually connect it. Then it disconnects nonstop. No idea why. 30 seconds into most calls it disconnects. I manually reconnect and 30 seconds later it disconnects.		Worst Bluetooth headset I have ever owned in terms of connectivity on Android 5 on the S5.		Worst of any headset I own, and I've owned dozens.  Disconnects and reconnects over and over on every call. Do not buy for Android.
1,Just wasn't what I expected. Didn't return because postage was going to cost basically what the case did.
1,Vendor removed my last review somehow and it says they are responding to my review currently?  Now they keep trying to bribe me to remove it via email for a full refund.  I have not bashed your product at all, I said I clearly saw it does not fully cover before I ordered.		---- original review---	As of the one received on April 20, 2016 it does not work well with the Galaxy S7 due to curved portions of the screen.  It does not fully cover the screen, which is stated in the description though so I was aware of this before ordering.		The phone is curved near the bottom (home button / fingerprint scanner) and the glass cover is simply too stiff to keep a hold on it.  It keeps popping off on the bottom even though it is on nearly perfectly.  I've had some minor issues with touch sensitivity too but not a whole lot.		I had this cover for my S4 and it worked perfectly for a long time.  Once they figure out the S7 curved glass problem, this will once again be an awesome cover I'm sure.
1,Nope
1,I could not find any  Chanel's that  were. clear. . Great idea just needs a little more work.
1,Ordered two ... both broke at the same point. Not worth the money, even if it was free!
1,Incorrect screw brackets does not fit iPhone 4 GSM
1,Worked for about 2 weeks now it doesn't work.
1,It served its purpose
1,This is a completly lie. There are no nano technology, only good glu that remains for some uses then is gone. Don't waste your money.
1,It protects the screen and nothing more. Corners have already started to lift and separate despite Spigen's suggestions.
1,It is impossible to replace the gear s2.
1,Batter stopped holding a charge in less than 1 month.
1,Thin cheap piece of material , Not much protection. worth less than you paid for it.
1,Cheap
1,May work for earphone wires, but not for charging wires.  Keeps jamming
1,It is a decent screen protector. It feels very nice, but the sides of the screen protector don't seem to be adhering to the screen. I also had a little trouble with the guide stickers, they all didn't peel like they should. When I pulled the guide stickers the paper tore with it, like an old sticker.
1,Case broke within 50 days.
1,Very loose connection. Won't stay plugged in and weight also plays a big roll in trying to find position that does not bear weight on connection.
1,Horrible . Not what I expected  at least from the pictures. Item was very cheaply  made.  Very hard to get on my phone.
1,Read the fine print, it says, "30 inches max".  Out of the three I got, the longest is 29 1/4" and the shortest is 27 1/4". Even though it was ordered via Prime it's not returnable either.
1,Just stopped working.
1,This case will do nothing to protect your phone. It comes in three pieces, and is extremely flimsy. It broke after a week, and that was with me treating it like a newborn baby.
1,My package only came with one lens, which was disappointing. It had the cap to the other lens, and that was all. Wish I didn't buy the lens.
1,This case doesn't look how I expected it to. It is very bright hot pink and didn't fit my phone very well either.
1,Fail
1,Cracked right away
1,4G Internet speed is very slow
1,Sound was great on this phone watching movies and listening to music but what irritated me is the quarter of the screen that was taken up by the HTC logo and the fact that the back of the phone is a horrible fingerprint magnet. Decided to return this phone for what I had originally ordered the lg g3..
1,Didn't work....returned.
1,It does protect the screen but it shows fingerprints.  Would not purchase again.
1,Messed up to easy
1,This screen protector succeeds at failing. The sticky side that goes on the phone doesn't even want to stick. Enough said? And it's not crystal clear as advertised. It's a little bit rough and grainy in fact. If you want a good screen protector spend a little dough and get a real one that sticks to your screen and protects this. This cheap piece of crap will fall off it's so cheap.
1,it's okay
1,I would have to say that I would go back to my very first flip phone before I used this one again. There are little to no apps available, it is slow and the back started to break around the edges after only a few months. It is considered a smart phone and requires a plan to match but it is the dumbest phone I have used yet.
1,This thing is CHEAP.  Out of the box, one of the arms that holds the device was broken.  The suction cup does not work, no matter where I use it and how many times I clean the area.  Overall, it is heavy, and feels like cheap plastic.  STAY AWAY!
1,So I needed MicroUSB cables to CHARGE my family's devices, this is by Samsung a very reputable company, and Fulfilled by Amazon another VERY reputable company. I also had about $15 Amazon Credit that made 3 of these free and a 4th very cheap.		So I bought 4. Initially they seemed to work well,  our phones showed the little lightning bolt over the battery icon indicating they were charging, but my brother quickly started complaining how slow his charger was compared to mine.		I had bought a FRiEQ 6-Foot cable at the same time since I needed a longer cord. The FRiEQ is the best cable for charging that I have found PERIOD. Very well constructed, and charges everyone's phones fast (although none of our phones are rated to charge faster than 1 amp; so I can't speak on whether it charges a note phone, or a tablet fast)		Today I discovered the helpful little app "Battery Monitor Widget" on Google Play. It shows in real time what a given cable/charge base combination feeds a phone.		I found that NONE of these Samsung cables, regardless of the charge base, charged my brother's Nexus 4 faster than 0.4 Amps of current and they usually stayed around 0.3 Amps. While the FRiEQ cable with a stock 1.0 Amp output would charge consistently at 0.8-0.88 Amps. (Note, though the charger is CAPABLE of charging at a full 1.0 Amps, the phone only pulls what it wants, so 0.8 Amps is acceptable, as none of my cables charged the Nexus 4 faster)		Very disappointed in these cables. Use them for strictly data transfer if you get them. They won't even charge at the 0.5 Amps a USB port gives.		It's been 4 months since my purchase, so I'm not sure if I can return these. But hopefully now that I KNOW they suck this bad I'll be able to.
1,I brought this case in hope of using it forever. It's lovely & it's my favorite color. The first day I had it, I realized that my service on my phone wasn't working well. I called sprint & contacted my Internet provider. All everything, I remember reading about cases that restricted service on phones. I even restored my phone. At the end of it all, it was the case. It makes me upset to pay for something I can never use again.
1,It's a sturdy case, but the coloring of the case comes off on my hand when in use. I'm a little disappointed. I bought a pink one but that one is okay.
1,I was very excited for this, I've been having trouble charging my phone with standard cables and this seemed like the perfect solution.		The case is white, which is not in it's favor, but I can deal with it. It didn't fit well, one of the sides wouldn't stick down no matter how hard I pushed and when I did it get down all the way, it would pop right back up. My standard case has no problems clicking into place and staying on. I'm not sure if the new case is bent, doesn't fit right in general, or if the bulging from the extra equipment inside causes it to not fit correctly. It looks like it should fit and that there are no cosmetic defects to prevent it from fitting.		The touchstone, cable and power adapter all fit together and plugged in. There are no lights, vibrations or other notifications to let you know if it's working.		I connected the back to the phone (As best I could) and it fit well onto the touchstone. There are magnets in the back plate that kind of force it into the correct position on the touchstone. But, when I connected the two, it constantly connects and disconnects the charger. No amount of moving it around the touchstone allows it to connect more than a millisecond and then it flutters back and forth between connection and not connecting.		I could not get it to work, I've been messing with it for a week. I've read online that any of the 4 pieces (touchstone, cable, outlet connector, or back plate) could be causing it to not work correctly. I can either return the whole thing or start buying new pieces and see if I can figure out which one is messed up. I probably should have just paid the $8 for a better cable and saved the money trying to wirelessly charge it.		I haven't tried to return it because I foolishly ripped open all the packaging when I got it. One of these days I'll learn.
1,Worthless	Doesnt hold phone over its magnetic surface
1,I purchased the 'iCarez Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 9H Anti-Scratch Easy Install with Lifetime Replacement Warranty' for my new Galaxy S7 and I think they need to go back to the measuring board. I installed the screen protector and it was very easy to install and looked very nice and clear. The only problem...which is a BIG one...is that it doesn't cover the entire viewable portion of the display. It is approx. 1/4" short in the width (left 1/8" gap on each side of the viewable portioin of the display. If it actually fit my phone correct and went to the edges of the display I would have kept it....instead I am sending it back for a refund. Buyer beware.
1,Bought for my wife. Cheap and junky.
1,Terrible design. I used this with the clip-on battery and broke it in no time at all because the bottom piece, which is brittle and sticks out like a sore thumb, must be removed to charge it. Had it in my backpack and it came off of the phone, bending in the process.
1,to tight on the phone could not use it with kept messing with the phone so it would not work correctly
1,Ordered for my Z61e, doesn't fit. Doesn't fit my Z61t, either. I wasn't expecting the world for $30, but something that is at least compatible would be nice.
1,Its OK. The stands not great and the rubber is very slippery.
1,Kickstand breaks to easy.  Had it for only a month.  Bought another one like that at local discount stor which the kickstand broke less then a week.  Waste of money.
1,I was super excited for this case but after it arrived I was easily disappointed with the build of the wallet. The wrist strap really drew me to this case but after attaching it to the case I could see that it would damage my phone eventually. The clip rubs right next to the top left of the phone and the bumper protection in the case is worthless, so you are just waiting for damage to happen if you don't constantly fix the metal latch. As for the phone cradle it is one of those phone cases with cut outs so no top or bottom protection. Also, not a big enough edge lip around the top of the phone screen to keep it from cracking should or if you drop it (which is easy for a clumsy wallet phone case that I love to use). Overall I am not happy with it. There also isn't enough give in the spine of the phone case so if you put in more than two credit cards and your ID the phone is bursting open and the magnet barely keeping it closed. I've had several wallet cases for my Android and this by far is one of the bottom of the wallet cases. It will do it job for now but I will be searching for a better coverage one.
1,Not so good if you want to use the camera while case is on since it blocks part of it and it reflects the flash on the image if flash is on.
1,Bought this to replace a previous case and this is far superior. Looks sleek, very low profile for my small hands and the white actually stays white. Fortunately I haven't dropped it so I can't comment on that but it feels sturdy and has air pockets at the corners which make me think it could probably take a hit.		UPDATE: Dropped it and the case cracked at the opening for the power button. I  dare not drop it again. Gets points for being good looking but not much for peace of mind.
1,Straight to the point.	The design is dull. It hides the beauty of the phone. It doesn't show the edges or the curve of the phone. The finish of the case doesn't feel sturdy either. It's hard to hold becasue it slides out of your hand. You'd think it'll be better due to the rubber, but I was wrong. It seems rugged tho I didn't drop my phone while using it.	The wrote part of it is how difficult the case to put on and take off and yet still doesn't fit right. The phone moves a little when inside the case.	When it comes to a phone like a galaxy s7 edge, fitting and design is top priority, and this case suffers on both of those.	I wish they'd give me a refund. Although, I ddint issue for one because technically nothing was wrong with it.. It just didn't meet my expectations.,
1,Thought getting reversible plugs would be a time saver, but depending on your phone or equipment, these micro USB ends just don't stay in very well. Great concept, but still needs work... We all need to go to USB-C, which is reversible by nature. It was worth a try, but ended going back to the regular micro USB plugs for all my stuff... maybe it was just my stuff.
1,Do not buy very cheaply made i hace an ebay case that was 6.00 100% better than this spigen sold my spigen on ebay
1,I bought this charger in December 2015. started using it beginning of January 2016. It's the beginning of March and one of the cords (I purchased 2) has started to act up. It'll sit on my dresser and I'll hear the phone beeping as the cord goes in and out of charging. So it must be loose or something because the cord I keep at work has not done this. So we'll see how long the 2nd one last.		UPDATE!!!!!!! this charger started smoking and smelling and sparked a lil orange flame
1,Very nice
1,A bit disappointed , cracked on corner the first day apied.
1,could not get the phone onto the dock. Removed the plug from the dock and plugged it straight into the phone. I wanted a docking station. This is NOT what I got.
1,Good headset for sure, with one MAJOR deal-breaking flaw. The volume is far too low.
1,This thing is super heavy, second....it does not works while charging like a normal powerbank would...they should tell you that prior to making you waste your money on this crap
1,Dont bother with with reviews in youtube and other places otterbox was a good brand. These days they not keen on what they doing, i am a loyal customer to otterbox  after using i understand this case didn't designed well enough to fit iphone 6 or 6s.  Battery only give one full charge thats it but they advertise more than it is which is not true, after using for one month the mute button not working with this case, this case was exchanged with previous one with defect but still almost the same, but i never expected anything like this from otterbox slowly i have to move away from otterbox,
1,Mophie cases are great...except for the fact that I have had 2 so far and both fall apart after normal daily usage.	The charging port slowly loosens, and degrades, to the point where you have to push your charging cord into it repeatedly in hopes that it will stay in and actually charge.  The first one I had (years ago) loosened so much that it fell apart (couldn't put a cord in it at all it was so broken).  The one I have not I have to push my cord in, over and over, until the charge shows it is charging.  I will not buy Mophie again, not worth the cheap construction.
1,I must have purchased the wrong item because it is impossible to apply this item to the device...and this is was done with 2 people. Bubbles occurred on the screen and it is very annoying watching them and can't do anything about it. Where the speaker of the phone is it is NOT stuck there correctly. Very hard to clean(afraid I might break the screen from pressing too hard) I can still see finger prints and smudges on the protection cover NOT like tempered glass acts...had the same problem with IQ Shield for my tablet. Very disappointing and frustrating product.
1,Case is nice, thin and elegant...BUT VERY slippery!!
1,I thought it would be nice for my wife to have a case that can hold more stuff.  The pictures looked nice but I regret buying it.  I would return but my wife trashed the plastic case that came with the case.  I would be happy if this product was $2 because I believe that is how much this item is worth.
1,Cannot be charged on charging pad. I have to remote it from my instrument , charge it separately while my original instrument charges on the charging pad separately.

1,Nice "looking", but did not work. The unit indicated that it was charged, yet it would not fully charge any of my devices. It also made a very loud, high pitched squealing noise and would get very hot. Perhaps better quality control and testing before it leaves the factory would help resolve these issues. Returned for a refund.
1,My daughter's iPhone screen cracked literally 10 minutes after I installed it.  And she dropped it from 1 foot onto cushy carpet.
1,excelente gracias
1,Bulky. Doesn't lie flat like the other types. I like the stretchy bands because my phone can lie flat on my desk or in my purse and slide in and out of pockets. The finger holds on this one are always out there and too thick to life flat. I don't like how it collects fuzz on the edges though. Need to use a thinner material.
1,I bought this back in May and only just got around to using it. How I regret not testing it within the return period. When I try to plug any usb item, e.g, my external hard drive or my Samsung Galaxy S4, to the the usb adaptor, it does not fit all the way in. The Note 10.1 does not read it.		The sd card adaptor plug is rusty looking, not sure what is going on there...		Oh yeah, and now it is way cheaper than I bought it. Oh well.
1,Can not open case to charge a waste of my money
1,His voice is too weak and too weak signal
1,The phone did not work a piece of CRAP I took it to Jamaica I thought it was the battery it was the phone.
1,First there is no indication that it is powered on. Usually there is a blue light that lights up.	Second, the plug in always loose, you have to periodically keep pressing it in.  That said. INCONVENIENT
1,Continually falls out of the CD player with the IPhone 6 plus
1,I don't like the bumper case, because I didn't know what a bumper case was until I got it. It just covers the outer part of the iphone, I thought I was getting an iphone case.
1,Color isn't the same as pictured.	Very pink. Too pink. It's not melon.	Very unsatisfying	Also, screen protector came off
1,The device is great when it works.  Easy to config.  Sounds great.  But I have bought 3 and all 3 broke in the same place at the top bend in a matter of a few weeks.  Verdict - design flaw.  Dont buy.  I have opted for the Moto Hint.  I love it so far.
1,Ok
1,When I ordered this, the description says that it fits the first Galaxy Note and its not! Its for the Second Note!! I was disappointed!
1,It doesn't actually close all the way. The cover is staying on, but I don't think it would provide much protection for the phone if my tween dropped it.
1,Did not fit my LG phone. Nice cover with all openings where they should be but was about 1/16" to 1/8" to small lengthwise.
1,Shipping was fast, cable was physically as described, but it doesn't charge the tablet. I purchased two of these and had them plugged up for almost 2 days with 7% on one and 9% on the other. Waste of money!!!!
1,Lol I don't know if the brand is a joke but everything in this package is not even close to being precisely cut to fit the watch. The screen protector doesn't even cover the full screen for God sake... I'm only keeping it now to protect my watch.
1,It was good using it the first few times, then the HDMI input would randomly switch without anything being touched.  I thought it was a one time thing but it occurred pretty frequently not too long after owning the item, so I sent it back for a refund.
1,My phone rattled around in this thing like a sneaker in a dryer. This holster is advertised for the 6S Plus but that's either with the phone in an otterbox or it's just made so big as to fit any phone. Do not recommend for a good fit
1,Burned out after a short period
1,Looks good in picture but it's not durable at all my phone got cracked once it fell
1,I had great expectations for this charger, but my overall impression of it is "meh". Does it charge my Galaxy S6 wirelessly? Sometimes. Last night it did not. I awoke to a phone with a 38% charge. It may be due to my case, which is thinner than an Otterbox, but I really couldn't say. When I placed it on the charger, the unit's blue light glowed and my phone's screen gave the "pulse" that it always shows when connecting to a charger. I expected to awake to a fully charged phone, but as I said, it was only at 38%. Thank goodness I have a truly fast wired charger that was able to get it to 70% while I showered. That's another thing-- it's not "fast". In fact, it's been my experience that it's  even slower than a regular wired charger. In summary, it charges sometimes, but not reliably and not quickly.
1,This item would be a 4 star if it came with a belt clip.  Please include a belt clip.  It broke after a few weeks of use
1,this cord is like 2' at the most, POS do not buy.
1,It's doing what it should so
1,Cracked corner over an inch. Phone was not dropped. Dust gets into the front facing camera due to no seal on the top and bottom of the protector. Good product but poorly executed.
1,Cases for Samsung Galaxy S5 Active can be difficult to find, especially if you want something other than a basic black. So I was excited to find this one in magenta and white. When I got the case in I thought it felt a bit cheap and stiff but decided to give it a try anyway. So far it seems to be decent protection for my phone, although I haven't had an major drops, just a couple of small tumbles. As mentioned in some reviews, the side buttons are pretty difficult to press with the case on. I expected this (from previous reviews) so I decided to ignore it. However after about a week of use I noticed that the magenta color has been bleeding onto the white part. I found this to be strange as it hasn't bled on anything else (skin, clothing, etc.) but it is annoying that it is turning the white part of my case pink. It's definitely not as pretty now that it is changing color like that. I would not buy this case again knowing what I know now, and I am currently shopping for a better quality case.
1,I can not vouch for the ability of this phone case to be able to reduce the radiation.  I can only take them for their word that it does so.  But this sort of case is mostly for those who hold their phone up to their head / ear when they are talking.  Many of us use either a Bluetooth microphone / headset or earbuds that have a microphone.		This cell phone case is actually two pieces.  There is the outside plastic case, which they call the accent plate. . . then there is the inside rubbery case which houses the radiation reducing part.  Unfortunately, they way of doing things makes the case feel like its falling apart.  Also, its not possible to purchase additional accent plates on Amazon yet, though I do see one on the StingRay website. .  .and its not cheap.  I also do not find the case to be fashionable in the least.  The word ugly comes to mind.		I LOVE the fact that the case is Made in the USA. . . but the current price is crazy expensive.
1,Worked intermittently with my Galaxy S6. Had to return.
1,didn't work and not sure who is to blame.
1,It doesn't work well for my family's cell phones. I bought 3 for stocking stuffers and we can't get them to work right. It isn't charging the phones.
1,Useless
1,It was so easy to install, with a special pin that has a knob for retracting it and locking it in place when the band is in the right position.  I also like the looks and the comfort.	--------> The Rest of the Story -------->	In March of 2018, the band separated from the watch (breaking away from the retaining pin) and dropped the watch into my car.  Fortunately it happened where I didn't lose the watch itself.  I'm very upset at how it failed in less than a year and with no warning.
1,very cheap product
1,Already chipped and had it a week.
1,I gave this rating because when I saw this case online I really liked it until I received it and found out that it doesn't fit my phone. I'm not a happy camper about this and it has made me make a decision to not order bling cases anymore off of here because I could end up having the same problem with that case as well. I wouldn't recommend this case to anyone that has a Samsung galaxy s3 i747 because it doesn't fit the phone at all.
1,Had to return it, because something is lose inside. The USB port is wobbly and out of place, and could not be used. This is how it got shipped. Not a very positive experience.
1,The extra screen shield is glued to the case.  The IPHONE8 screen wouldnt respond thru that screen.  I cut it out and went with glass screen protector.  Now I am seeing the home button is too deepthe case is too thick.  I have always like the Otter case protection but this one is just too difficult.  I tried to make it work by literally cutting out the problems so I cant return.  I learned a lesson so all is not lost.  Sometimes buying online isn't the best option.
1,flimsy, didn't take long before I replaced it.
1,In my opinion this is trash!! The solution that you apply to it before you put the screen protector makes your phone all wet!! The solution and air bubble remover doesnt take all of it out . I wasted my money on this. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.
1,This item is fake.  The transparent lens is made of PLASTIC.  The white paint can be scratched off with your fingernail.  Fake.
1,This product is too big and ugly
1,doesn't work, no connection.  My old cable still works, it's just frayed so i bought this one.  A rarity among the amazon basics line, it doesn't work.  As cheap as the price is it isn't even worth returning
1,You do get what you pay for. The case is cheap, bulky plastic. If I'm going to have a bulky case, I prefer to go with Otterbox, and did just that. The soft rubber exterior part (the black in the picture) kept coming off. Returned the entire package to the seller. Clearly plenty of people like this case, I'm not one of them.
1,Poor quality, deteriorated within 6 months; had to buy a new one
1,The rubber doesn't stay on the plastic well. I've re-glued it a couple of times since I like the case otherwise, but it never lasts long.
1,Came on time neatly packaged but battery has been on charge from 2:30 pm and its now 12:49 am and its only 54% so am guessing its a faulty charger very disappointed
1,Not really as advertised. Meh
1,So...I hate to say it, but you get what you pay for.  This one didn't last but a few months before it started peeling away and falling apart.  What's more, it smelled terrible and left a nasty mess on the iPhone.  It offers no screen protection and will only safeguard against short drops.		Long made short - save your money and buy something else.
1,Cheapy little phone case for the price. Not worth it.
1,I don't know what to say about it.  Real glass screen protector, but regular glass and very thin.  The case is not aluminum.  Its almost a cast iron.  If you drop your phone in this case, it will guarantee your phone will be damaged.  The case is extremely heavy, and the phone sits right against the metal.  The cast iron case also blocks any signal your phone would normally receive, so you will not have phone or data reception when your phone is in the case.  Its like putting your camera in an unlined lead box.  Nothing will penetrate it, and if you drop it, goodbye camera.
1,This was supposed to be better than the old one it was replacing the D-Link Wireless N-150 Mbps USB Wi-Fi Network Adapter (DWA-125) which is 10 times faster and strong the LB1 supposed to have better security etc.  I went back to my old D Link the LB1 actually doesnt work as well at all.		Feb 3 2016 Update: Customer service commented back and I did call them.  They said there is only a 90 day refund or send in for a $6 shipping exchange.  Why spend more money on something that doesnt work?  Geesh...  Now I went from 2 to one star.  Oh well.
1,This thing is garbage.  The first time I dropped the phone the screen got damaged.  a couple days later and the thin strip by the volume buttons broke off.		DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!
1,I have long been a fan of Tech Armor for my cell phones and recommend them to my friends and family. They are easy to install and lasting. However, the 1st time I used my S Pen on my Note 3, the screen protector scratched leaving a permanent line. I would not recommend this item for the Note 3.
1,Although the battery was brand new, it still did not work any better than the one I was trying to replace.  It very likely was manufactured several years earlier and lost its ability over time to take a charge.
1,Cheaply made barely work on my iphone or my ipad don't waste your money on these threw them in the garbage
1,Horrible product
1,Do not buy!!!  Took me a half hour to do this twice because it was missing the stickers to help apply!!  Both covers had large scratches from the squeegee card that came with it!  Looks horrible covered in air bubbles no matter what I do  do disappointed!
1,Cheaply made, no good, very bad headphones! Everyone knows that pretty or handsome person that just lacks common sense... these headphones are cute but don't work. Such a waste.
1,How do I warranty my protector? The first protector didn't work, it wouldn't adhere to the screen.		The second worked great but now I'm out one protector
1,Doesnt work as described. Gets extremely hot and kills both batteries so it actually may die faster than your normal battery.
1,Doesn't cover the flat area. Way smaller than the actual flat area. Next!
1,It was less than what I expected. It does not snap shut like I thought. It's only magnetic. Not too sturdy for an expensive phone.
1,THI SITEM DID NOT DO WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO I HOOKED IT UP AS INSTRUCTED AND I GOT NOTHING AND IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY
1,The instructions specifically say that before putting a phone in it, you should leak test it.  I put a dry paper towel in it, sealed it, and submerged it in a pan of water for 5 minutes like they advise.  The paper towel wasn't just damp -- it was soaked!  I'm not putting my $400 phone in one of these cases.  I'd sooner trust it to a ziplock baggie.		There are other similar style cases that have double or even triple seals that work much better and more reliably.  This case only has one seal and it's not even like a ziplock style seal -- it's just two strips of soft plastic being pressed together.  Do not trust your phone to this case!
1,This case caused my phone to COMPLETELY not work. I could hear it ring, but I'm guessing a sensor is covered up because I couldn't use my phone at all. As soon as I took the case off, it was fine. This thing is also a MAMMOTH although it says the dimensions so I can't fault them for that. Unfortunately, I sent it back as it did NOT allow my LGV10 to work.
1,Very nice case. Had to replace after 3 days. Power button fell off. Will see how the replacement holds up. Received a new replacement. Power button fell off again. This case is a nice design and has food potential except the power button falls off. Too bad. I have to give it two stars.
1,The metal connector broke after light use. Do not buy.
1,I got this replacement battery because my current Samsung batter could no longer hold charge. I realize getting a lesser known brand that I would likely get lesser quality than one from Samsung. I found that the battery was great at first holding a charge for a long time like the battery when I first got my Samsung phone. However I found that in about 4 weeks this battery degraded to the level that took the original Samsung manufactured battery 15 months to reach. You buy cheap you buy twice. I'd recommend spending the extra and getting a new battery manufactured by Samsung. That's what I'm doing.
1,i don't like it it wasn't what i expected its like silicone i was expecting hard case not see through
1,Should have read all the bad reviews before purchasing.  They are 100% correct.  The protector is made too large for the watch screen and there is no way to keep the protector edges stuck to the rounded edges of the screen face. As soon as the solution dries the edges pop up all the way around the face.  The middle of the screen looks smooth and clean but the edges will not stay down.  I tried all six protectors following the instructions exactly as directed by the Skinomi website.  Waste of money and time.  Also note that I have installed 15-20 protectors from skins to tempered glass on most all iPhone models.  I should have know edge to edge with skins would not work and I am mad at myself for buying them.
1,Very poor quality, when it arrived the case was broken already.
1,I bought two of these in April, 2014. One of then failed in under 90 days. The other failed at about 150 days. I also bought two Anker car USB chargers in June, 2014. One of those failed at second usage.		Anker's advertised warranty is deceptive. The fine print says it only honors its warranty if you buy from them direct. And guess what, they don't SELL direct. You'll be bound to Amazon's 30-day return policy if your Anker product fails.		A lot of quality marketing and packaging here ... but very low product quality. Buyer beware.		UPDATE [2014-09-27]: Within 24 hours of posting this review, I was contacted by phone by a customer service representative of Anker. The representative: (1) immediately offered to send a replacement for the product (that failed after one use) at no charge and also asked which current version of that product I would prefer as the replacement (2) explained that Anker WOULD honor the full 18-month warranty for products sold via Amazon -- if contacted directly, that Anker considers Amazon sales as Anker direct sales. (The Amazon representative apparently misinformed me on these points) (3) inquired if I was satisfied with the performance of the other Anker products I currently own and/or if they required replacement (4) did NOT at any time ask that I remove or modify this review (though I volunteered I would do so).Accordingly my initial review, in terms of Anker customer service and warranty, was ill-informed and on that basis I have changed my original one-star rating to a three-star rating, withholding a full four-star or five-star rating based upon the fact that the products did indeed fail.		UPDATE [2014-10-10]: As stated above, I bought two of these Anker batteries in April, 2014 and one of them failed in other 90 days. Today, the OTHER one started to fail, at about 150 days. The "shaker" gizmo that starts up the charging process started working inconsistently. This is the same "shaker" gizmo that 100% failed on the other battery after a ride home from Vegas in my checked luggage. That means that of the FOUR Anker products I bought last spring, THREE of them have failed. These Anker products may have fantastic designs, marketing and customer service/support, but what good is all that if they don't work. Anker should quit spending time playing kissy-face with customers and spending money to ship replacement products ... and get focused on solving the root causes of their product failures. Based on this 75% failure rate I have reset my earlier one-star rating BACK to one-star.		Now in my Amazon cart to replace the Anker external batteries is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Lumsing-GC-930-8-8000mAh-UltraThin-Gold-External-Battery/dp/B00KXKJRV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lumsing GC-930-8 8000mAh UltraThin Gold External Battery</a>. While there are few reviews, they reflect superlative build quality, even high-quality instruction booklets, right down to perfect English. That's a good sign. Also there aren't any product failure complaints. All the other major brands had numerous product failures noted under 1-star reviews.
1,I really like these cases, I've tried 3 now. One for my 5s and two on my 6. They add a slight amount of bulk to the phone but not bad in exchange for the amount of grip and protection you get. However, the problem I've had is discoloring. I had a beautiful blue case for my 5s and over a few months it discolored badly into a dirty greyish blue green color. When I got my 6 I got the clear/white case, hoping for better luck. It looked awesome for a while but then the same thing happened. Over time it turned into a greyish brownish color. I tried different ways of cleaning it, no luck. Tech 21 sent me a replacement case, which was great of them, but the same thing happened. I like everything about the cases but I've had all three discolor so I'm going to try some other cases.
1,Too small to fit the screen .	45 minutes to put on , with out bubbles .	Still had a dent/bubble at	the bottom right that would "NOT" go away .	Scratched by keys while phone was in jeans	pocket .
1,Cord never worked but the base wall plug in worked. POS cord
1,sorry we cancelled our order
1,Wrong battery for my phone.
1,Band opened up while I was walking. My watch fell off and shattered.
1,dont buy
1,nice case, caseology really needs to widen the diameter of the aux port. it's just a hair shy of allowing most aux connectors to securely plug in. I have to take the rim of the case off to get an aux to securely connect. don't have that problem with the iphone 6s plus skyfall case but this one does? idk, just widen it plz.
1,Galaxy S5 got so hot, I couldn't use this.
1,Super cute case. Extremely difficult to get off. I actually had to break it to get it off.
1,We received the case, did the water test, installed the phone.  While we told our daughter NOT TO TRUST THE CASE she "accidentally" dropped it in the swimming pool.  When we retrieved the phone seconds later - there were a few drops of water inside the case - sufficient enough to damage the phone!  Now, we need to buy a new iPhone (fortunately we have insurance but still a $169 outlay).		THIS CASE IS NOT WATER PROOF DESPITE CLAIMS!!!! LifeProof DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANYTHING!!!  This should be a good indicator right there.		This case is great if you want to protect it from accidental splashes, but NO MORE!!!!
1,The mouthpiece broke off and had to request another one.
1,Case is durable, dropped my phone and it didn't crack or break... BUT it did break my LCD inside my phone. As many times as I dropped my phone without this case this never happened but the first day I drop it in this case my screen messed up.
1,This charger does work as advertised.  The phone gets warm while charging.  My main problem was that you have to set your phone on the wireless charger in the perfect position for charging to work.  I have the problem of a messy desk, and too many times while getting ready for bed I would put the phone on the charger, but later I would bump my desk and slightly move the phone, and then it wouldn't end up charging, but I wouldn't find out until then next morning.  After a couple of weeks of trying to use this, it ended up in my box of gizmos that I don't want to throw away, but that I don't ever use anymore.
1,Very low quality product, will not recommend to anybody. Biggest regret on buying this. Anybody who ordered it and still have option to cancel it please do so.
1,All the reviews here to date for this product appear to be submitted by young women employed by a review mill. Poor grammar is a dead giveaway. Just beware that most 5 star reviews for iPhone 6 cases sold on Amazon at this time are fraudulent and are as plentiful as cockroaches in a NYC subway.
1,***UPDATE - January 2015***	So after just five months of admittedly heavy use (nearly daily use) of the kickstand, the little tab that held the kickstand in place wore out (it did not break) and the kickstand would no longer stay closed.  After a couple of weeks of this, the kickstand caught on my coat pocket as it was being pulled out and not only did the kickstand break but it tore my coat pocket too!  In addition to the kickstand issues, the silicone part that goes around the phone is starting to tear at the corners.  So I am back to looking for a phone case that uses a different kickstand retention method and is a bit more durable.  I realy liked this case at first and do wish it would have lasted longer.		***Original Review - August 2014***	I have been using this case with my S4 for a month now and can say I will definitely order another one for any phone I get in the future!  For me a kick stand was a must as I use my phone as my night stand clock every night.  For those looking for a quick summary of the case here are the Pros and Cons as I see them.		Pros	Kick stand	Front of the case rises above the phone screen	Silicone skin part for grip	Hard case parts for protection	Nice tight fit	Removable rotating belt clip	Plenty of clearance for a screen protector (not included, I used an MPero branded one and really like it	Yellow color is VERY high visibility		Cons	Adds bulk (but that is unavoidable with this case type)	Can not have the phone screen side out with the belt clip on	Kickstand does not stand the unit up enough (for nightstand clock use)		Now for more details.  This is really a three part system as you may note from the pictures.  It has a hard "back" piece with the kickstand built in, a soft silicone "skin" that is placed on your phone and finally the "front" piece that incorporates the belt clip.		The "back" piece has the kickstand built in to it.  The kickstand is pulled out from the case and a "horizontal" piece that acts as the stand off then needs to be pulled out from the case and locked into position.  Once this is completed the kickstand is fully extended, it is quite secure and does not fall.  It holds the phone up at a 50 degree angle to the horizontal which is a perfect angle to view movies or other content on your phone.  But for the main thing I use it for the angle is just OK.  I would love to have it at 70 degrees or so.  However, I have used the kickstand at least once a day and every single night for just over a month now and it is just as secure as the first day.  It also stays tightly against the back when not in use.  This piece does add some significant bulk to the phone while in use but that is to be expected with this type of case and I did not buy this for minimum bulk but instead bought it for protection.  The "back" piece wraps around the phone and extends 0.1-inch above the screen in six area (four corners and along each of the long sides on the phone) to protect the screen a bit.		The silicone "skin" provides a good grip on the phone and acts as a shock absorber.  The skin covers the volume and power buttons but does not interfere with the operation of the buttons at all.  The "skin" too extends above the phone screen as well to provide protection for the screen when set screen down.  The skin fits nice an snug once adjusted (this took a bit of fiddling as I am a bit of a perfectionist) but once completely set it fits well.  For me the "skin" also adds some color to the case as I got the yellow version.  The yellow is the same color you see on construction equipment so is VERY visible which is a plus when you use your phone for outdoor sports or in wooded areas (as I do frequently).		The "front" piece incorporates the belt clip and completes 360 degree protection of the phone.  This is the weakest piece of this case in my opinion.  It can only be put on with the phone screen in so that it can not be seen.  The interior of this piece is covered with a very soft micro fiber material to prevent scratches of the phone screen.  The phone slides from one short end into the "front" piece.  because of the micro fiber material it takes a bit of pushing to get the phone to slide in but not excessive.  The belt clip swivels so you can clip the phone either horizontally or vertically as desired.		All in all this is an excellent phone case and I will buy another one when I need to.  I will update this review if anything changes or as time goes on.		Final thoughts and observations:  My sister bought several nearly identical "off-brand" versions of this case for her kids iPods.  The kickstands on those units are not nearly as nice as the one on this I-Blason version and those have all broken in short order.  I have a coworker that has an S4 and the Otter-Box case.  Comparing her case to mine they appear to provide the same protection but the I-Blason case has more features (kickstand and belt clip) and costs a whole lot less money!
1,Not cowhide leather! Misleading listing. Very unhappy. Sent back.
1,The thickness is great and very clean look, but i bought this for the privacy portion of it and i almost have to turn my phone sideways before the screen is to dark/blurry to not see whats on it. I have seen better privacy covers, this just fails. It is strong for the protection factor if thats what you want but don't expect much else.
1,Admittedly I didn't really use this case but I got it because I wanted a card case that had a pretty color. This design seems like a knock off of the speck card case. It didn't seem like it had as much impact protection or was as well constructed as the spec case. Returned.
1,These phones may be unlocked but they are branded AT&T. They come in Nokia OEM packaging and are labeled unlocked by the distributor. They just failed to mention the service provider branding. The return was easy. Just not the phone I was looking for.
1,Not what i was really expecting. I was hoping to have the original ability of my batteries charge but nope...just as crappy as my old one
1,Junk
1,Works too well! Does a great job if you're inside, with your screen light at max. As soon as you take it outside however, not even you can see it. Would not recommend!
1,This case is only good for special occasions. I would not want to use this open case face daily to protect my phone..
1,I've had it for about a month and already 2 cracks on the sheet.
1,i had the unit for about a month and is has already broke.  poor construction
1,UPDATED 11/17/2016:  After a few months, I have changed my opinion of this phone case from 3 stars to 1 star because my phone went flying one too many times due to how slippery it is.  The glass screen protector even cracked although, the screen itself was mercifully undamaged.  I am going to finally buy a different case - this one is getting tossed.		PREVIOUS 3-STAR REVIEW:  The quality of this phone case is excellent.  The fit is very snug and conforms well to all the controls of the phone.  It also looks great and seems durable.  However, I would not purchase it again because it is VERY slippery and therefore increases the changes of damage to my precious phone.  There have been occasions when the phone went flying across the car during sharp turns.  Also, the volume buttons are a little difficult to access since they are placed underneath the rim of the case.
1,The phone case is cute but provides virtually no protection. It is nice when you want an inexpensive change but don't drop your phone with it on
1,Both stopped working after 3 weeks.
1,Don't buy this, it is a piece of junk.  I pulled it out of the box and you could not physically put a cable into one of the USB ports.  The other USB port charged my phone for about 5 minutes before it quit.  Save your money.
1,This is a personal preference bias. The case itself is great quality, fits well and kickstand works smoothly, however, as a protective case it only promoted slips and drops because of the use of very slippery silicone for the inner shell, plus the use of a non-grip plastic outer shell, making the phone feel like it is coated in baby oil. Just like silicone products used in baking, the effect is non-stick, but in a phone case that doesn't serve well, for me. If they could have added some ridges or just used a different base material, or even used something more grippy for the outer shell, this case would be great, but, for me, when looking for something to protect my phone from drops, what I don't need is a case that slips through my hands far worse than just the phone itself would. I had a similar gripe with a Sedio case for my Nexus 7, but the silicone slip on that case was offset very effectively by a grippy outer shell and raised ridges along the exposed edges of the inner silicone shell as well. On this case, I also didn't like that the inner cover doesn't give much raised ridge protection for the screen in case of a face down fall, or at least not compared to the case I had. All that being said, if you like silicone cases, this one does have pretty excellent fit and finish. A slippery case just isn't for me.
1,Volume and power controls are not very well fitted.
1,I received the Elite Sliver as a gift in Oct. 2012. First one lasted 4 months before it died completely, and that was not without problems. First, it would constantly beep when wearing it. Also, it would not turn off when put in the off position, and the battery drained very quickly. The battery finally quit after 4 months and Motorola sent me a warranty replacement. The second one is now 17 months old and is also failing, but now outside warranty. Battery only lasts for about an hour, and it too constantly beeps. The positives are comfort and quick to charge. Negatives are poor battery life, poor voice quality, and the charger itself. While the charger works great, it is the only way to charge the headset as there is no charge port on the BT itself. Sure enough, I lost the charger and had to purchase a replacement for $20.00. Also, the BT fits comfortably on my ear, but not in my ear, so whenever someone calls I have to press and hold the speaker to my ear canal in order to hear the caller. In addition, most callers have difficulty hearing me so I have to cup my hand near my mouth to direct my voice towards the BT.  Both of these actions totally negate the concept of the hands-free headset. I have played with every sound and volume adjustment I could find to improve the call quality but it just is not there. I previously owned a Motorola BT H710 that I was extremely happy with it, so I had high hopes for the Elite Sliver, but it has been a major disappointment. I do not recommend this product.
1,I purchased this product envisioning a great working product, but I guess that was too much to hope for. The battery dies three times quicker than my standard BH5X Droid X battery and the extended battery cover came broken. In end; a big waste of money.
1,tempered glass is good, but the kit only came with tempered glass, the packaging says a widget, a screen clean wipe and a cleaner, nothing came but glass, if you need the cleaner which is need to prepare your screen, getting another kit.
1,Very ill fitting cheap case. I hope you don't expect it to protect your phone.
1,Customer hated this ugly case....it is too small and is nothing like the picture shows....very ugly and very disappointed with this case....it also did not fit the Galaxy S2 phone....
1,I bought this back in November 2015. It was okay and it works as described. However, 2 weeks ago I had a accident and dropped it on the ground, Let's me say, about less than 2 foot drop. The screen protector sustained some damages. One on the upper right corner and it appears like a bullet shot. I guess when it drop it lays flat on the ground and landed on a small rock or stone. The second one, it received a damage on the buttom left. So I would say, this screen protector is okay as long as you won't drop it. I need to figure it out on how to contact the seller.
1,Did not work......said card was invalid!
1,This black band looks practically the same, but feels different. This is a softer silicon and more floppy. It feels silky against the skin but bends more. The loop that holds the band end has a notch inside to lock it in place, but does a bad job as its so soft and pliable that its won't actually lock so it might as well not be there. I also noticed that dust and skin particles are difficult to remove making the band look dirty whereas the original Fitbit band looks and stays clean practically all the time. After only one day of use, I have to say this isn't worth the money based on its performance.  I would try a different brand and hope for better luck the next time I get another band.
1,UPDATE****	In less than 36 hours of use my rating has dropped from 4 to 1 Star.		Why		1 The chemical solvent smell slowly becomes nauseating.		2 The belt clip pulled out of the case on the first use. The adhesive used was a very thin layer of tacky goo that probably did not setup and cure properly because of the chemicals used to process and condition the leather. There was no mechanical connection used to attach the belt clip just a little goo and friction. I had clipped it on my belt walked out the door and in less than a half a block it dropped off.		3 my new screen protector now has some scratches on it. There appears to be some very fine grit in the surface of leather inside the case. In the short time I have had my G-Note I had no scratches until I used this case. Now I need to get a new screen protector.		*******		It's a nice case but what ever they used as a leather conditioner has a solvent smell like GoJo hand cleaner used by mechanics to remove grease oil and grime only stronger.	There is a slight oily residue on it also similar to GoJo hand cleaner.		the G-note fits easily and has room to spare.		the note being such a large phone a few modifications to the design would help. the inside flap comes up past the side of the phone it would be easier to get got the phone in and out if it was a little lower. the opening at the bottom of the case were elongated up the side part way up the side making it easier to get the phone out		the cover flap covers the entire side of the case and goes all the way across adding good protection		pros:	cover flap covers top and side completely	looks good	phone fits easily	stitching is straight reasonable attention to detail.	loops to prevent it from getting knocked of your belt		cons:	nasty leather conditioner	solvent smell	oily residue	needs to air out in the sun for a while	belt clip poorly attached comes off and spring is weak	needs a better softer lining it has some fine grit pressed in to the surface
1,Would not fit my phone at all!!!!!! Complete waste of my $!!!!!
1,Not impressed with these cables. The pins/connectors bend easily. They do not make a secure, solid connection to my Kindle or my Android phone. Several times I plugged in my device, thinking a good connection has been made, only to come back an hour or so later and discover it has not charged. The rubber-like covering on the cables sticks to things also. I ordered the woven nylon cables in the past and will go back to them in the future.
1,I don't think I've ever received and decided to return a product so quickly.		I'm a biker who just upgraded to a phablet, which is cumbersome beyond reason to carry on the bike.  An mp3 watch seems like the perfect solution (yes, an mp3 player might be simpler.  However I don't always have pockets, I hate arm bands, and I hate clipping things to my clothing.  I know, first world problems).  An option for communicating in case of emergencies might also be nice, so an mp3 watch it is.  So all I'm really looking for is an mp3 player that's easy to wear, with a time function and possibly texting in a pinch, not a device to be my new best friend.		I first tried a GT08, which seemed to work nicely but it bothered me when I noticed I had paid twice as much as I should have (the problem with these Chinese knock-offs is the same product is available from different sellers at vastly different price points).  Plus I really disliked the "nucleus" menu style, so thought I'd try a different model.		There was a lot to like about the CNPGD.  Right out of the box, the silver metal finish looks very high quality and the band is much nicer than the GT08, very supple and comfortable.  The menus are much cleaner and easier to navigate, having only 4 rather than 8 (mostly useless) options per screen.  It let me transfer all my music into the required "my music" folder (something I suspect all these watches have in common to use the music player from your SD card) via PC, much more painless than the GT08 that made me hand select each song from the watch screen individually to move (note:  I had to reboot the watch for it to find them, a minor inconvenience since the boot sequence is very quick).		However, the love affair ended instantly when I realized to my dismay there was no shuffle option to be found anywhere for the player.  I really wish if this isn't to be a standard feature that it would be mentioned in the item description.  Who wants to listen to their playlist straight through in alphabetical order?  Stupidest omission on an mp3 player ever.		Another maybe not so small complaint is there seems to be no way to change the truly ugly watch face -- tapping the screen (which the GT08 required) did nothing, and I couldn't find any theme settings anywhere (not like there are a ton of places to look).		So the search continues.  Thank goodness for Amazon's painless return process, however I'm now out $12 in return shipping fees.  If my third attempt is a bust, I may have to start considering something in a much higher price range (although from what reviews I've read on a few products, that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality either).
1,Didn't stay on long the ends won't stay down. When the ends lift dirt out my pocket or purse gets under it. It looks very bad on a $800.plus phone.
1,The chrome inlay fell out on its own. Cheap case.
1,Doesn't adhere too well , especially around the edges on a regular S6. Now that I think about it gets 1 star.
1,thank you.
1,worked for about a month, then didn't work anymore.  I guess $2, what would you expect.
1,Contacted the otterbox customer service and these are Authentic Otterbox defenders. WARRANTY THROUGH OTTERBOX IS VALID AND EASY REPLACEMENT FOR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS! So No Worry if yours is defective just contact otterbox and they will replace without you having to send the defective one back..		 I use to think otterbox was great but now understand why they have such a great easy warranty.....if their product is in fact defective, they are Not Liable for the damage caused to your phone due to the otterbox being defective....Sooooo Making the the extra 60 bucks some spend on then worthless! Oh and the $349 phone you got less then a year ago worthless to!  Otterbox in all cost me 715 buck I would run the other way!
1,Not only did it break after a couple uses, but my galaxy s7 was super wobbly when driving. The shaking was annoying.
1,The pins that attach the band to the metal frame are too short.  This causes the band to fall off and not attach securely.
1,The smartphone are functioning bad. The earphone didn't function.
1,I have always been a die hard HTC fan but this model is making me think it is time to change. I was tickled when I fist bought this model, but now 6 months later, I am awaiting warranty replacement #3 as I do this review. Here are the combined issues I have had with this model:		1. Lighted buttons on the phone work intermittently.	2. Sim card reader burned out on first phone.	3. Problems with intermittent sim card errors on second phone.	4. Launcher occasionally resets itself when unlocking phone.	5. 4g data quit working on 2nd phone.		I usually do not carry phone insurance and did not on this one. Although all these problems I have had so far are under the 1 year manufacturer warranty, I am now worried that I have a high likelihood of having to by a new phone at full price after warranty runs out. Not because of my handling of the phone, because I am always extra careful, but because I have a strong chance that replacement #3 will not make it until my 2 year At&t renewal discount.		This phone is great in day to day use, but the reliability has been terrible for me. perhaps you will have better luck? or maybe not?? Buyer beware.....
1,Impossible to install without having one or two edges that pull off screen. Have it installed for 4 days and have trimmed it twice to keep it on the phone
1,Hate it
1,Not sure these actually help. They tend to slide off down the cord to where they provide zero protection.
1,It works, but takes too long to charge phone
1,Junk
1,Not good. The case does not fit tight on the iphone. Just too thin at some places.
1,the picture is super fuzzy, and the plastic is weird, like plasticized foam. Not durable, and the image scratches off very easily.  Between this and the ship time, not worth it.
1,The other part broke so fast, did not last
1,Nice pouch and material, but too many other problems: 1) I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 with a Lifeproof case which is advertised to fit in this holster. It does not fit in that the flap is not able to come down far enough over the phone to adequately secure it. Also, 2) the magnets in the flap are very weak to begin with so when the flap is not able to come down all the way there is even less ability for the magnets to work properly. Again, less secure hold. And finally 3) the really big goof is that the end of the tang or clip that is supposed to go over your belt is the exact same length as the inside of the clip that is part of the swivel so you cannot simply slip it on to your belt because you will miss the clip entirely. (A little confusing here.) You have to physically separate the front and back of the clip so the belt can fit in - otherwise it will go behind the whole clip and the swivel of the holster will be sitting on the belt without any security because the belt is not inside the clip.
1,Super cheap.  Paid less than five.  In my opinion unattractive color.  Fits fine.  Ordered a clear one instead of using this.
1,Great shipping and good service from seller. Even BETTER than the seller described.		I bought this phone to replace a galaxy s3 which I dropped and broke the screen and camera (SCREW YOU VERIZON, not giving me a few month early upgrade!)		However the phone has a camera hardware defect from the factory which makes all pictures taken under low level lighting PURPLE; so bad its a waste of time to even take a picture under low light (increasing the ISO or firing the flash doesnt help) As someone with 2 babies who is always taking pictures of them this is HIGHLY disappointing.		The rest of the phone is awesome, love the IR blaster, love the aluminum body. GREAT sounding speakers.
1,I bought one of these (not from Amazon) a bit over a month ago. Tried and tried to get internet access, driving to locations somewhat nearby my home. No luck. Finally called and FP said that the device wasn't for access in my location. (Although their coverage area supposedly did.) The tech told me to return it. (Or pay them $60 for a different one.) I returned it. Two days later I was billed $27.98 for service. Made every effort to get them to tell me why they refused to refund the charge. Finally gave up and am having my credit card company get the money back.
1,When it is plugged and you want to remove the phone it is complicated
1,Not as pretty of a red as it looks here.
1,I bought it as a 'thank you' gift for my friend.  It took forever, and I would have returned it, but my friend was too polite to tell me it didn't fit until much later when she lost her phone, and I said didn't the color make it easier to fine.  She was embarrassed to say it didn't fit and never was able to use it.
1,I ordered a case for my  S6 Edge + and the case arrived before my phone.  This case is advertised for the S6 Edge plus however this cases is for the original S6....way too small.  Very dissapointe!!! now if  I can only get my money back
1,It doesn't stick well ,	very poor poor poor pad. Take this pad from Amazon shopping pages. I did put it in the trash. it is a trash and waist of money and time.
1,Sloppily put together glue all over the case and design was out of place. Looked like someone rushed to just throw something together and send it out.
1,I really wanted to like this case as I thought it would give me the ultimate protection for my iPhone 5.  However, the proprietary headphone jack cable that you must carry around with you and the ultra small hole for the lightning connector proved to be too much of a negative for me.		I found this case to have the following PROS:		*  Well made with quality materials	*  Easy to assemble or disassemble considering the tolerances of the fit, which are tight	*  Protective screen cover doesn't cause any delay in touch response		I found this case to have the following CONS:		*  Proprietary headphone jack connector	*  Headphone jack connector must be carried with phone at all times if you wish to use the jack.  They could have made this optional so if you wanted to use it without the connector, you can.	*  Headphone jack connector is $20 for an extra one; only available from them.	*  The hole for the charge port is too small.  It only fits Apple OEM plug.  Aftermarket plugs, such as the awesome 6ft RND lightning cable I bought Amazon don't fit, so you can't use them.		So, if you never plan to use the headphone jack and you use nothing but the OEM lightning cable, this case may work for you.  However, if either of those are a factor for you, I would look elsewhere.
1,Not happy, rubber didn't stick to window, tried the dash not there either. Heroes feeling off. I tossed it finally
1,I do not like this wallet. You cannot remove the phone easily to talk on it. Feels cheap.
1,too small for iPhone 6 with mophie case
1,Relatively easy to install, however an alcohol wipe would really improve the process. The first one was wasted because the cloth and sticker combo isn't very good. I still had a couple pieces of fuzz on the screen when I installed it. I would probably go with a different product.		Edit: had the second one on for a couple weeks now and it's starting to lift. Not on the corner or an edge, where you expect, but kind of in the middle. Definitely would not recommend.		2 stars because it still does provide some protection.
1,This case was great on the 4 and 5. However it seems the designer was a little lazy and didn't adjust the thickness to match the very slim 6. The case for the 6 can actually fit two iPhone 6's comfortably
1,Too small for the Nexus 6p, tips over way too easily. Could be better designed to not tip over pretty easily.
1,The protector created a pixely halo around all the touch censors and made it so you could not really use the phone and the side volume buttons did not click just kinda mushed in the housing a minimal amount
1,You get what you pay for if you know what I mean, else seeing is believing. If you want to showcase your Galaxy S2 with 100 bubbles on the screen, this is the right screen protection to get.... So congratulation, for you have found the right product. Enough said! Its your money, so you choose... Thank you for reading.... check this out... it doesn't mention it, but it also comes with two quality screen protection... this is what I currently use to safeguard my investment.	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LVU37S/ref=oh_o03_s00_i00_details
1,It works ok but it really muffles the sound....
1,Feel like I got burnt on this one. It cost me 25 bucks to have this installed. I couldn't get the cover off with the toos was supplied. I chalked that up to inexperience. So I paid to have it installed. The battery last about 4 hours. The original that I needed replaced will last close to 3. When I first bought the phone the original gave me all day into the evening. This one supposed to be better then the original. I got suckered by the reviews. I cannot recommend this battery or the kit. Because of Amazon I could send it back. Then I would have to pay another $25 to have yet another unknown battery installed. Not jumping on that wagon. Buyer beware.
1,never worked or even charged didn't even come on i wasted my money
1,These don't fit very tightly and the plastic gets grungy quickly.  It won't even clean up with a Mr. Clean magic eraser.  I replaced it.
1,This case tore in about a week and a half. Returned for money back.
1,Nice idea if the touchscreen area wasn't raised and required extra effort to make contact with the screen. Made the phone feel like those very first touchscreens that every came out on phones.
1,I had a Blue Cyclops case and loved it.  The black one I just purchased seems like a totally different case.  While it is shaped the same, the buttons are very hard to press and the charge port is much smaller.  The rubber part of the case has a different composition and is a much firmer material.  Charge cords that workd with my first Cycops case for the exact same phone do not work any longer.  Because of my first case be so awesome I am really disapointed in this one.
1,I was very skeptical at first.  It took 3 days to charge the battery, and it didn't even get to full capacity.  So I decided to give it a test at charging my cell phone.  My cell was at 50% and it was fully charged within about 30 minutes.  I was VERY impressed at how fast it was.  I have an LG G2 cell phone.  The battery has a pretty good capacity.	I agree with another review that the battery does not hold much of a charge even over night.  So you mostly just have to make sure you can charge during the day...but it can continue to charge even on indoor lights at night...I thought that was funny.  I mostly bought it for when the power is out and I need to charge stuff or on camping trips.  So far I'm pretty impressed since I didn't think it would really work to begin with! HA! We'll see how long it lasts. I've only had it for about a week and a bit.	Update: 11/16/15	I've had this for a few months now and have realized a few more things about it.  I actually bought three of these for 'testing'.  I realize now that the battery has to be charged in order to charge any electronic, you are not using the solar energy to charge your battery but the sun must first charge the battery and then you can charge your electronic.  I also found that to charge the battery via solar charge is rediculous.  It never charges.  I've had all three batteries charging every day for 3 weeks now and they are all at the same battery level....soooo what's the point of this if it never charges via solar?  Might as well just buy a battery pack.
1,Died!  Already died.	Wtf....
1,Garbage
1,This wireless mobile phone monopod works great at first! Easy to use, the instructions is clear and the shipping is very fast. Eventua;;y it gets Very disappointing!

1,It's not a case. Just a decoration. Pure flea market junk
1,I gave it close to a year and I am replacing it with an Iphone.  Condition is still as new tho it never was at purchase and was definitely from some foreign country. Turns itself on repeatedly when in the shirt pocket and this well known problem cannot be fixed other than screen protectors and in my case electricians tape around the button.  Its has a good screen protector and heavy case but not much better.  My At&t minutes went from over 7000 to just over 700 in a month of its dialing up when my pocket with the screen lock securely set. It finds a way on its own to activate.  Camera works well and too well as it is often turned on by itself in my pocket.
1,Of several high quality cables I own, the only one that makes good enough contact with the QC port is a reversible cable that by its nature has a very tight fit.  My phone won't recognize it as a QC port with any other cable, and won't charge above 0.3 amps @ 5v with any other cable.		Most chargers has a plastic area in front of the metal ports that serves to tighten the fit.  This does not, the metal ports themselves are directly exposed, and are closer to ovals than rectangles.		It's a shame, because if you can get a good connection, the circuitry charges great, and there are few chargers that include USB-C yet.		But in the end, a charger than can't make a good connection with charging cables is useless.
1,I had the chance to try out these Backbeat headphones and I am not that happy with them. Let me explain why.		First these headphones to me don't fit in my ears well, even with the various tips. The headphones constantly are falling out of my ears. As soon as I think I have them situated I turn my head and it pops out. Next, the volume doesn't get that loud for me. It's sufficient but if you are in an environment with any noise for me it was hard to actually hear my music. Third, the on/off button is too close to the volume up/down buttons. I hit the wrong button constantly.		What's good about these? The battery life is decent and I like that it uses the standard micro usb cord, nothing proprietary. But that's about it.		If you are in the market for bluetooth headphones my preference is the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Jabra-SPORT-Bluetooth-Stereo-Headset-Black-Yellow/dp/B005FVNHBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellow</a>&nbsp;which is a bit cheaper, and also includes an fm radio. These also stay in/on my ear unlike the BackBeat.		I would pass on the backbeat and go with the Jabra Sports.
1,Cheaply made had 10 of them arrive broke. Save your money and get something else
1,I got the first one, No signal. Second one No signal.		I doubt the phone is not from Moto, its just says Moto, the build quality is so worst.		As long as you sty away from all the Non warranty products U R SAFE.
1,This home button will not work with my phone.  It could just be the material that it is made of.  I have used other aftermarket home buttons with similar design with no problem.
1,This is not a transparent case as the picture suggests. Returned immediately! Hassle free return however!
1,THE PHONE HAVE VERY LOW VOLUME I ALOS ADD A VOLUME BOOSTER TO THE PHONE AND STILL VERY LOW VOLUME ITS IS GOOD FOR A CHILD BUT NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE OVER 18 I GUESS SINCE I BOUGHT IT SO LOW YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU BUY...
1,I was hoping that this would turn my bevy of USB cables into charge-only cables. Unfortunately, early tests show that it's not as good using my charge-only cables.		Laptop test:		data cable: ~400mA	charge-only cable: ~800mA	PortaPow + data cable: ~500mA		1A AC adapter test:		data cable: ~600mA	charge-only cable: ~1.2A	PortaPow + data cable: ~600mA		You're better off spending the same amount of money on a charge-only cable, as the the PortaPow doesn't seem to work very well at all.		I'll update when I have tested with my car chargers. But, so far, after testing with two laptops and two AC chargers, the results are quite lacking.		Update:		I have tested using my 12W car charger:		data cable: ~500mA	charge-only cable: ~1A	PortaPow + data cable: ~500mA		I think that it is pretty clear that this product does NOT work. It's certainly not going to charge my devices at anywhere close to what I would get with a charge-only cable. You are better off just getting a charge-only cable. These typically work even better than the the cables supplied by the device manufacturers. With my Nexus 7, I get ~600mA output with the original cable and charger. I get ~1.2A when using a charge-only cable and the original Nexus 7 charger. And, a good charge-only cable is about the same price, if not $1-2 more.
1,Falls out on bumpy roads.  Ok for around town, forget it on long trips, it will fall out and wreak your cell phone if it hits the screen
1,No doubt it is a very pretty case and the phone looks more like an S6 version of the note - however - you cannot remove the S pen which defeats the whole purpose of the note 4
1,Lasted the wife a year. White parts discolor severely and falls apart.
1,Hinged door did not stay closed, meaning if I wasn't careful I could easily drop my cards. Quickly picked a new case.
1,Inexpensive and it looks like it.  Unlike another brand of clear case I bought on Amazon for my Moto X, this one arrived with the clear back scratched and scuffed.  Not too noticeable when on the phone unless you hold it just right in the light, but very noticeable when it's off the phone.  I didn't send it back because it was so cheap, but next time I'll pay a little more and get a good brand like the i-Blason I got for my other phone.
1,Bought two of these primarily for using with iPhone and iPad. The lightning connector does not work with iPhone at all, intermittently with iPad mini. These do not seem to be MiFi certified and coming from Belkin is horrible to say the least. Total waste of money.
1,the phone came LOCKED and support has been useless and unresponsive. I love the phone but buy it elsewhere
1,Horrible quality & customer service!!!	Buyer Beware ...stay away
1,Ordered on Sept 15th.  They DON'T supply tracking info, like everyone else.  Says on order info that I should have by September 23 (it is currently October 5th).  On top of that, I did MORE research (while waiting for this late order) on phone forums and the overwhelming consensus is that these are crap (scuff fast...google it yourself).  I paid for them and I still want them...principle.  Even if I toss them in the trash.
1,don't really remember having alot of problems with these protectors..........Oh now I remember if they are the ones I recall they didn't fit in my phone too large and couldn't seal protectors. Don't recommend them
1,another waste of money, this clamp is cheap plastic, doesn't stay put which is the whole point.		Don't waste your money.  Plus the company junk mails you for reviews. Ew.
1,Looks pretty, and durable - but it isn't. I purchased a cable and it does not provide a steady connection for data. This cable will charge your device, albiet extremely slow, and fail to transfer anything.
1,I purchased this for my son and the blue paint on the hard outer cover immediately started to chip. Soon after that the blue hard outer cover started to break apart. So now the left side of the blue case is gone, as well as the bottom blue piece. Buyer be ware.
1,To begin I'd like to add that I did not purchase through Amazon, Best Buy rather.		After my HTC Desire 816 (loved the phone) s*** the bed, I went out and bought an HTC Desire 626. Huge mistake, returned that within an hour. I haven't seen a phone that bad in years. Then I got the Motorola G, better, but still coming out short. So after a few weeks with that, I came across this phone at Best Buy. Sitting on display in all its glory, such an attractive phone. I thought wow decent screen, same size as my 816, and just the right amount of features. The night I brought it home the LCD screen started to haze white, almost as if the contrast and brightness were cranked all the way to 11. So I returned the phone the next day hoping it was just a fluke, nope. Same issue. So because the issue goes away after a few minutes when it happens, I said screw it I'll just ignore it. But there were other problems I couldn't ignore, the phone started to run like crap, slowed way down, froze constantly, battery life was terrible. It was a major waste of money. What frosted the cake, I ended up dropping it from about 3ft, with a case on, and the inner LCD screen shattered. What a complete piece of garbage. After that I said I had it, I'm going back to flagship phones, purchased my FIRST Apple product ever, the iPhone 6 Plus, switched to Boost Mobile, and I haven't looked back since. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this phone and thank me later. Or come back here for an " I told you so".	Pros:	Cons: It's junk.
1,I returned this product.  I have a Mophie Case on my iPhone 6 and the mounts are too short to hold it.
1,Poor Quality !!!!
1,It is fitted perfectly, you'll keep the low profile of the phone and gives you a couple extra uses as the notification little window and fast access buttons, but its protection capability is very limited. I, in fact, lost an s7 edge glass when it fell and the cover opened on its flight down. I think you must use a screen protector cover in any case.
1,Purchased the same product in Midnight Blue...Matte finish started flaking in a few days. Incipio will charge you shipping to return for replacement. Buyer beware. Good product if you want to use if for a few days.
1,I needed a protective case for my Samsung s6. The SUPCASE fit the bill prefectly. This case is awesome in every way. High quality, Great looks, Easy to install, Fits like a glove, Snug fitting holster, Outstanding protection. All this without adding much bulk and at a great price.	  I read some reviews that stated the case buttons didn't line up with the phone and required a lot of pressure I did not find this to be true. I highly recommend this case. I'm so impressed with the quality of  SUPCASE products I'm ordering one for my Samsung Tab 4.	  Update Update Update. While the case does provide good protection the holster is junk I've had two break in the last 12 months. once when I was taking my phone out of the holster the clip that holds it in broke off and this morning when I clipped my phone in the holster the same clip broke. Supcase does not carry just the holster so you have to buy a whole new case and holster. I won't be buying any more and I advise anyone else to say away from this item.
1,Upon opening this product, the bottom piece broke and I couldn't get it fixed, easily. I gave up. It was very cheaply made. And it seems like this item will not last too long at all!		On a better note:	Latest Unique Design : I like the idea of the Bluetooth Selfie Stick. It is a travel size and handheld. The tripod 2-1 design is genius! It allows me to take pictures alone... I love the hot pink color and the way that it looks, besides broken...	It links with my smart phone via Bluetooth very easily. It travels very easily, and it very compact.	Built in Mini Rear-View Mirror is really cool and makes it really easy to take pics without the reverse camera.	Besides the cheap-y design, and my device being broken before I touched it... It's pretty cool. It's a good quick gift.		I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.
1,Needs everything
1,Nice
1,I purchased this last week here at Amazon through CCMAAccessories.		However, this unit doesn't charge. I plugged it in using the provided adapter and charging indicator light goes on red (for a brief instant) and then turns green (again for a brief instant) and then goes blank. The headset doesn't get charged and I cant use it. I tried the provided USB cable with my computer - but again the same result.		In this day and age - I expect electronics to work out of the box.		I know I can return it - and I will - but the hassle is just too much.		Now when I search for 'dead Jabra bt500' on google - I see many similar complaints about it not working out of the box.
1,I buy these for all phones. This kick stand cant even hold the phone up. The phonr just tumbles over. Going to try to get a refund.
1,These chargers broke my tablet when i plug the charger in the wall it makes a shok sound like its about to electrocute somebody the current went in my tablet now my tablet glitches never again
1,Scratches too easily and grimes up as well
1,Outer ring of the bumper case snapped in half at the volume control buttons within 3 weeks of using the product.		The phone was not dropped it was simply in my pocket and broke.		Was a nice case for the short time it lasted however I would highly recommend not wasting your money with this sub-par product!
1,This is a cheap piece of plastic. For the price its fine but I wanted something a little more sturdier. This thing keeps falling over and I have to hold my phone in place because otherwise it will slide back on the table. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 and it barely fits on it with a slim phone over.
1,NO DIRECTIONS AT ALL APPLIED THE NEW LENSE. HORRIBLE! !! BL URED PIC'S IS WHAT YOU GET. FORGET TAKING PICTURES WITH ANY LIGHTS AT ALL ANYWHERE. DESTROYED THE PICTURE WITH RAYS OF THE LIGHTS. NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS PRIOR TO LENSE CRACK. OVER 128 GB OF PICTURES.  VERY DISAPPOINTED
1,The case looks great. Cant lie, but the sides still flimsy, moves around a lil. There's almost no protection for the phone... because of the flimsy sides. Dirt and dust gets trapped in there, bleh I don't like it. I don't trust it at all... even though I knew that going I , but  pass on this one to something,pre steady
1,Not to bad but mine has sharp edge that I am sure is a result of a poor manufacturing process. If it weren't for this I would easily rate is 4 or 5 stars.
1,Don`t Buy. Spend a little bit more if you want something that works well. Seriously, this item is of very poor quality. You will want to return it but it won`t be worth the hassle or the return postage. On the possitive side, the item arrived in just a few days.
1,My mom got me this case and gave it me for an early Christmas gift (her amazon) but I got it and was so excited. The black in the whiskers and eyes were wearing but a sharpie fixed that. It got dirty really fast that when I put my phone in my bag for school I had it in a plastic bag in case a pen popped or something.  And I dropped it one the bow and came off and the bottom broke along the seam. Fixed with glue but it got really dirty when I dropped it. And finally my cat knocked it off a counter and the top broke totally. I tried fixing it but now my phone gets stuck. It barely lasted two weeks. DON'T BUY THESE FROM CUTIE PIE INC. you're better off paying more for a better quality one. I have a new one in this color coming from another seller as well as pink and purple.
1,do not seem protect all the corner of the phone.  The look is nice.  real leather and soft. but do not think it will protect the phone if i drop it..well did not try to drop my phone just to test this product.  so i return it and bought a different case.
1,Garbage. Only very limited functions work for VR glasses. Complete waste of money but not worth sending it back.
1,Horrible merchandise cheaply made buttons not accessible and can not hear properly when on speaker
1,This headset worked great initially but after 3 weeks I'm finding that the claims that it has 12 hrs of talk time & 336 hours of stand by are totally wrong. It also connects & disconnects from the phone frequently.		After reading all the reviews I'm starting to think I have a defective product & will probably send it back for a replacement while I still can. It's very comfortable but if after 2 days the battery is low & I've only talked on the phone for perhaps a total of 1 hour at the most then something is wrong.		It is really comfortable although if I move my head too much while it's on it does flop around & feels like it's going to fall off & there is no way to adjust it but it is far more comfortable than the in the ear models.
1,cheap
1,Didn't like much
1,Leaves air bubbles! Look for something better
1,Decent, I've used better.  I'll have to replace it shortly.
1,When I received the case, and tried to my new Samsung Galaxy S4 phone, noticed something right away, case doesn't fit with all  four corners well...one corner would raise up more than other three corners so afraid if phone would fall out of the case....not satisfied with the case.....
1,It was bad as well tore as soon as I put my card in and the flap doesn't close on the front
1,This was not a good iPhone 4S charger! It broke after one use! Beware of this iPhone 4S charger!
1,Absolutely crap. Scratched on day 1 and cracked day 2. No case but still. Feels like plastic not glass.
1,The pull ties for the zippers came off within 3 days. I had to make new ones for my self or pay to shop the old one back.
1,It was crazy hard to get the screen to go on with any particles or artifacts stuck in the plastsic membrane		Once I did manage to get it in with minimal dust: I got some rainbow oil streak going up and down the phone display.		You have to use a stupid cable to use the headphone jack, because a standard jack will no longer work.		Speaker phone becomes really difficult to use after installing the case		I didn't think this purchase was a good one.
1,will not work with phone
1,Don't like this phone, not in that great of shape and working
1,Great grip and fit, however the orange is more like peach.  Under certain lights it even looks pink.  Not so manly.
1,Ring tone was to low and it was to its maximum. I gave it a two because the camera took clear crisp pictures.
1,These actually came earlier than expected which was a plus!  Theres a ghost image on the screen but it's easily over looked for the price we paid :)		Edit**3/8/17	There is a ridiculous amount of dust and lint between the rear camera and the outside protective glass.  The pictures are very blurry.  Very disappointed with this as it was not part of the sellers described damage
1,The reason this have one star because I never got the package due to shipping issues. Which I've shipped to that location before. I has all the right components I need. I end out going for Mr. Shield again but the 2 pack one with out that board to press the screen down to get rid of the bubbles.
1,Did not work
1,Going back. The neoprene cover fits loosely and the hard glitter cover doesn't properly keep it all together. The Edge side easily pops out of its case.
1,it charges SOOOOOO SLOW!!!!!!! seriously! it goes up 1% every 10 min. I stopped using it the day i bought it. i doubt if you put it on charge for the whole night that itll get to 50% charged. this thing SUCKS! take my word and don't get it. just dont.
1,My first edged would not charge properly. Amazon immediately sent me a return label. I ordered another edge. My second edge you have to shout answer to get the headset to answer your call but sometimes that still doesn't work. The Legend Plantronics was a better product but it has stretched out of shape and kept falling off my ear. I will see if this second ear piece will charge properly.
1,I tried to install several times, was extra careful and still got bubbles.
1,It works, and it seems to work quickly enough -- except it makes the iPhone very hot (even with the cover off.)
1,Does not stay on the phone very loose fitting and falls off
1,As I read the otherr reveiws, they all have the same jilted, English/Chinese style to them.  They read much like the instruction sheet.  They all use commas instead of periods, aand have no or poor syntax. They werre obviously all writtten by the same person, probably hired by the company.  Gee, I wonder how that happened?  Does Amazon care abou thesee things?		Positives - nice feeel on the plastic; initiallly seemed high quality.  Negatives - the instruction sheet says that, if the phone is in the case and the case is chargingg, the phone will charge first.  This is not true, and the phone NEVER seems to charge while in the case. Big disappointment and means  you would have to remove the phone if you wanted to charge both the batterry and the phone.  The other huge problem for me is that my earbuds are not even close to fitting.  The cheap ones that came with the phone fit, but they are a POS.  I also do not like the way the case slides shut, once the phone is in there.  There is no catch and it seems to slide pretty easily. There is no catch point. I am worried that the case woud open and the phone would fall out.  This one is probably going back, which is too bad, because I like the concept.
1,Just something about Lifeproof cases that i do not like. Also cannot hear when talking on the phone.
1,does not fit
1,Junk. Terrible spot for on/off switch. Almost impossible to turn on or off without a pen or knife. Volume even at loudest level is too low. Feels and looks cheaply made. Not sure of all the positive reviews...seems fishy. Wish I never bought it.
1,I have mixed reviews about this. Ordered many of these because I had one and loved it so wanted to share with family. My sisters broke where the round magnetic circle attaches to the rod. Emailed the seller and have not heard back. Wish they had better customer service because I do like the product and my concern could have been remedied if they had better customer service.
1,Wall charger was defective first thing out of the box. The red light comes on (the one that's on the charger) to show that electricity is going though it. When you plug the charger into the phone, it goes into lock screen but does not charge. Phone doesn't seem to recognize there is a charger connected. I have a Galaxy S4 from Verizon. I figured the price was too good to be true.... It is.
1,That's just a garbage, it was broken and unquality that i am really dissatisfied
1,Very poor quality, tinny and crackly. Purchased this a week ago and am in the process of returning it. Will look at the M50 instead. Have a Great day.
1,Not made for an edge.  Edge side is cut too high
1,first of all it didn't even fit my phone, on top of the fact that it it very translucent when i thought it would be a solid blue. i can honestly say i do not like this phone case. but credit to the seller, it did come on time!
1,I purchased an OtterBox Defender case for my iPhone 5S a year ago.  The case does a wonderful job of protecting the cell phone.  But the holster/belt clip is awful.  The company had to replace it twice in a year and I purchased another one from another vendor, which now is also broken and unusable.  Some of the other posts have mentioned this.  The design is extremely poor.  While I love the case, the holster (and I really like to wear my phone on my belt, for convenience) is absolutely awful.  Surely the company can come up with a reliable design.  Otherwise, I may be looking for another option to protect my cell phone.
1,bad
1,This case is horrible, Not only did it not fit my phone but while struggling to get it to fit I actually bruised about 4 of my fingers! The only reason I didn't return it is because I'm too lazy for all that boxing and labeling stuff... But yeah don't waste your time or money on this thing. It's like trying to stuff a square into a circular space... Not gonna happen!! Very dissatisfied.
1,We have gotten a couple of Otter Boxes lately that have chipped and cracked. This one cracked while putting it on. I still have a couple of the older ones on an Ipod Touch and that work great but the two newest ones we have gotten including this one crack and chip. I don't know what the difference is but it is a big pain. We got one replaced and the replacement did the same thing.
1,Love the length of these braided cords. The pink cord quit working within just a few days, the other two charge fine as long as the device's battery percentage is 50% or above. When I tried to charge a kindle, which charges rather fast normally, that was almost completely dead this cord took forever-only charged up 5% in an hour. You get what you pay for, and I wouldn't bother with these again.
1,It's a thick silicon cover, but speaker slots don't line up. Also doesn't fit snug  at all. It's loose, making it feel very cheap. I'm going to buy a different one.
1,It is pretty.  It feels like fused micro beads and is pretty and neutral.  Definitely not a watch and for the opera, but nice for a night-out with friends.  However, 1/2 the band did not actually secure to the watch, rendering the entire thing positively useless.
1,The waterproof part works great but pics are blurry to the point of I have to take the case off to get decent pics. Too much of a hassle
1,These cases suck and like any battery will deteriorate over time. My drink friend spilled a little bit of beer on it and within less than 6 mo it stopped working for me.
1,Color wears off showing white silicone underneath. Would be much better if silicone base better matched top color. Bit otherwise I love this band.
1,Didnt charge my iphone once till 100% Looks ggod but I returned it not worth the money
1,I really had hoped for another solid case from Rokform, but that is not the case.  I have owned the Rokform case for my iPhone 4s and 5s models and those were excellent.  This case the back insert would not stay locked in and then it developed a crack in the Polycarbonate material on the back.  I have only had the case for two weeks and never dropped it on the ground, so I'm sure that the case is defective and I will contact Rokform on this issue.
1,This item was not quite what I expected.  It is very cheaply made. The side up and down volume buttons does not work with cover on.  You are unable to make any adjustments to the volume.  It took over a month to receive from China.  I did not realize it was coming from China, but will pay closer attention in the future.		I was going to send it back, and decided to just keep it.  The two stars I give are for:  When this cover is on, I do like how it looks on the Iphone.  And, two, it comes with this adapter piece for the headset.  I also like the way it feels in my hand, but not when speaking on it.  None the less, in my opinion, it is of low quality but cute.
1,returned immediately - was cracked.
1,It gets loose every second. Very tough to keep plugin to the car.....i have to hold it every time when i need to charge my cell.....not a good product.
1,did not fit very well couldn't get the hard cover part on the phone...this product was returned!
1,Junk it tore after the first time I wore it and its not leather like it says it is.
1,These covers are horrible ! They don't stick around the bottom nor do they stick on the right top ! $	,
1,at the edges of the film sticks dust / debris. Protective film is packaged in a blank sheet of A4!
1,Not real otterbox
1,The phone came on time and with a case but the charger doesn't work properly. Also there is a feedback when a call is received. I sent a feedback already but got no response.
1,Ive had this for two months and the USB tongle things have both fallen out and of course don't work now.		I bought this because I wanted a battery pack to replace one Ive had for 3+ years, which by the way is still going strong. This is not worth the money buy another brand.		If I could give it 0 stats I would but cant.
1,This unit is having problems charging my phone. I thought it was the case but I have removed the case and the only way to charge the phone is diagonal. if the phone is vertical or horizontal it will not charge.
1,2 stars because I did end up buying it twice... Broke both times.
1,Flimsy, loose, cheap, ugly and not worth a dime. I would not buy this and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,Case fits perfectly for everything except the headphone port! While mobile and keeping your hands free, you must keep bottom of case open at all times, exposing the phone. Not only is that area vulnerable, but so is the rest of the phone as the top bottom case begins to expose itself because of the bottom opening ripple effect! The belt clip keeps getting stuck on "open!" And I am terrified that this very thin plastic case and rubber shell will not protect my $800 phone!  If anything it'll be scratched from this cheap plastic breaking all around it!!!  Returning this as soon as my new case comes tomorrow!
1,don't buy this phone! battery issues!, I had it for 4 months! at first I loved it but now it sucks!  too much issues! don't buy it
1,Can't charge phone while cover is on phone..gives character toniphonevbut charger will not attach properly to allow changing .. Change design and resend.
1,The interior soft part doesn't fit well and get squished by the external hard part.
1,Its a cool looking case but it eventually stretches and doesn't fit my phone. It was also a pain putting and pulling it out of my pocket.
1,False advertising. Was labeled that it would fit my iPhone 6 Plus but wasn't even the right color the holes were not in the place where they should've been in order to take any pictures on my camera and it is way too small. This is not an iPhone 6 Plus case.
1,The colors are great, but this was just a waste of money. These covers do not stay on the phones, if they won't stay on they are pretty useless. Save your money and buy something that actually works.
1,Just ok phone
1,phone is too heavy to hooks onto your vent.  Most vents are plastic and break easily.
1,I ended up getting 2 cables of the correct size and for some reason the third one was a different size.  The correct ones don't communicate properly and are seriously cheap. I don't recommend these at all.
1,I got it befor time i love that, but i hate the fact that i only got to use it one time! So no good, don't wast ur time on this!
1,There are no instructions with this thing. So I turned it around in my hands for a bit, then unfolded it -- and it snapped in half broken! I hadn't had it for five minutes! Junk.
1,Shipping was on time but I will say they are a waste of your money they are junk they stop working after about a week after I ordered them
1,Junk.  Stopped working after short time of use
1,Didn't last long
1,For the price I found it kind of cheap ever used it
1,Only because I have to give a star, feel apart first day, doesn't fit like the picture, the gold doesn't like up like the picture.
1,Didn't stick
1,Didn't hold in place.
1,I believe this is an off brand, didn't charge well
1,Terrble, you'll end up with a lovely phone that no longer has any ability to be used as a phone, a music player, or use any accessories with non standard sizes.  Did a warranty swap, second case was worse than the first.  Look elsewhere for a waterproof case.
1,Got mine in July 2012, RIP on my vacation Oct. 4th.  I just used it to charge my Droid 4 phone when traveling and could get a couple charges out of it.  Appears to be a short where the plug flips up and down on the ZAGGSPARQ2.0.  Will not charge or charge my devices.  Called Zagg and they are sending replacement, but require a charge card to send me a new one.  I then have 60 days to send the other one back.  I would have preferred to have just sent the item back and they send me a new one.  I do not like the idea of having to give a charge card to get a FREE warranty replacement. I like the form factor and design, but should have listened to the other reviewers and gone for another brand battery pack/charger. I asked if they will send me the new model Zaggsparq6000 that replaces the Zaggsparq2.0, but they said I would get the old model instea.  Hopefully, this one will not be a lemon.  If so, I am going to insist they give me the new model since it is clear by all the bad reviews this ZAggsparq2.0design has issues.
1,quite working after just a  couple uses, guessing is not IPhone 5s compliant.  Advise, only buy charging  cords that specify they	are IPhone 5s compatible or you will be wasting your money. They will cost a bit more, but no hassles.
1,Way to slippery to handle so Im not gonna be ussing this case there is no grip to this case whatsoever , I was not expecting this , not happy
1,Two stars because I can no longer get to my s-pen, which I use frequently.  I do not even have large hands/fingers.  If I turn my pinky sideways and stuff it in there, after a few flicks I can get it out.		As a Case:	As for the case itself and the ability to protect my phone...it seems like it will do alright.  It was and is a very snug fit.  It feels very solid and adds a bit of weight.		Credit Card Stash:	The credit card portion is a bit difficult to open but I would rather have it be a bit difficult versus having it be too easy and my cards just falling out.		Wireless Charging:	I have added wireless charging capability to my phone and it still works FOR ME.  Depending on your charging pad and battery adapter, (if you have them) it may or may not work.  It's pretty picky about how it has to rest now.		NFC:	Again, a bit picky but I was able to beam a picture from my phone to another.  Granted I had to remove the other phone from its case to get NFC to work.		Summary:	Overall, for a case to protect my phone from damage and that allows me to easily transport my plastic and feels ok in my hand.  Having to fight to use my S-pen does almost completely ruin this for me.
1,Broke first time I dropped it. Did save my phone once, so it gets one star. Not a protective case.
1,Bought Feb 2015...Cynogen Operating System ...Very bad update...left phone unuseable...Worthless!!!
1,Is okay I guess real sensitive though rather get the clear common one
1,So I just purchased this item and got it for same day delivery the type of material on this band is amazing but the only problem is that when your trying to adjust the band the other band pos off the holding button I'm returning this ack yo them
1,external speaker died after only 3 months.  No ringer or vibration after it died so no way to be alerted to incoming calls.
1,Fine phone but don't carry it anywhere that it can in contact with another object. No pocket. No purse.		The over-sensitive side buttons place	 calls, shout for voice prompts, take photos, or (worst) kill the ringtone.		Verizon offers no fix.		Also of concern, many websites do not respond due to Windows hybrid status.		Typing can be near impossible without inserts or edits permitted -- only re-entry.		Pretty display, though.
1,The back sliding panel comes off way too easily. Granted you can snap it back on again, but over time perhaps it will not hold anymore. Rather not take the chance. The material looks good on the photos, but in person, it doesn't look so good IMO. It'll cheapen the look of your iPhone 6S Plus. I like the concept of having the credit card slot, but material and construction/build wise, it is not up to par. Returned it.
1,Gif for my husand. He takes it to work and the dust does get through to the scrren
1,If I could give this p.o.s. -8394959394992929013473738 stars I would. The case came all effed up. It has three layers of protection. Two out of the three layers are made out of cheap ass plastic. It is suppose to give your expensive ass note four good protection but that's the opposite that it would do. Then it says clearly that it is lifetime warranty. That's BS because I contacted the sellers and they gave me a BS response. This is a perfect example of you get what you pay for. Save your money and buy an I blason case  for 8 more dollars. Trust me, that case is very legit and you can trust the case with your expensive phone.
1,not very sturdy...closure pieces for cords are hard to manage. Got this for my son as a gift...he refers to it as "cheap"...not a good buy
1,I am not a technical person. The instructions manual seems a direct translation from Chinese and makes no sense. Had it out in the sun for hours but did not fully charge (3 stars only). Also have no idea how to turn on flash light. pushing button nothing happens at all. Amazing they sell something like this.
1,The one major flaw with this armband is the way it holds sweat inside with your iPhone. Not a huge fan of the inside of the holder (and my iPhone) being wet.
1,I ended up sending this case back because 1. the built in screen protector felt weird on my fingertips. What I mean by that it was hard to run my finger over it without getting stuck. No smoothness if you know what I mean. Also as ruggedly built and no doubt strong as this case is, it still lets in dust and dirt and leaves the camera lens totally unprotected. Which just wasn't quite good enough for the device I just spent $400 dollars on.
1,Good caddy, but my Nexus 5 bounced out. I managed to grab it, but when going fast over bumpy pavement, it's not the time I want to let go of my handlebars to grab the phone!
1,Had this case for a month the seems started to fray and the wristlet portion broke off. I was disappointed. I really liked the look of the case, it just could've had better quality material.
1,I returned it. Later learned that internet access settings have to be properly configured for US to send pictures. Perhaps this was not done..
1,This case is not suitable for Nokia 950XL. Absolutely not the same slits for the buttons on/off and volume. As for camera button, no slits. No perforated holes for speakers. There are two holes that do not need them for this model of phone. Conclusion. Marriage or deception. Unable to attach photos.
1,Same volume button problem as other posts. The case interfered with the buttons on the LG G5 and made it unusable.
1,Weak won't hold and S5 even in place let larger phones worthless if its on a desk its Ok in anything that moving it falls over easily.	I could just see my phone sliding off and on to the floor with this so avoid.
1,not good protection. Good price. Like the transparency. Will take to work or try to have kids sell to dummies
1,does not keep the charge. as soon as you plug it in charge is gone.
1,Did not work.	Admittedly I did not contact seller so have no comment there.  However the product is very bad!!  It was made with only two prongs instead of three and the light indicated it was charged and twice I ran out of power because of that.  It's a useless item.
1,Ripped within two weeks. Threw it out and had to buy a new one. I'd look elsewhere for a clip for your note.
1,Arrived Damaged. Was Thrown away in error
1,Did Not work for me..Disappointed. Great Design tho
1,Not great.  I literally dropped one of the protectors on the floor when I was installing it on my phone and it broke!!
1,Not touch responsive at all will be returning ASAP
1,Mediocre sound quality- most reviews made it sound like these would rival corded headsets, but nope- these are pretty lousy. I have much more expensive LG bluetooth earbuds that sound  wonderful but are not built for jogging and sweat exposure. I was hoping these inexpensive earbuds would be great, but they are not!
1,I've had this for about 8 months, VERY DISSAPOINTED. very low volume, can barely hear callers. Callers can barely hear me. The over the ear style headset doesnt seem to fight tight enough, and if you happen to jerk or move your head very fast, the headset almost flies off. I do also get a little bit of "bluetooth static" MY BIGGEST PROBLEM, is that for some reason this thing randomly places call, when I don't even touch the headset. I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason. IT constantly did it, and became annoying as I could not shut off the call with the headset, and had to fidget and try and get my cell phone out of my pocket to end the call. I replaced it with a Jabra 250v and absolutely love it. Dont bother with this headset, although its fairly cheap online, as compared to the $80.00 at most retailers, you'll be extremely dissapointed.
1,Makes phone hot, not fast charging s9
1,The hole for the front facing camera was not in the right spot and I always had a black spot where it was covering my camera.
1,Normally i would rate this 5 stars, but i was very disappointed with this cover. The cover itself is great but it did not glue itself to the case. It has fallen off 2 times already. Maybe i got a bad batch but it also happened to my other cover for my iphone 6.  If it wasn't for this i would rate this 5 stars as i've had this cover on my old iphone 5s
1,I lined it up perfectly, and the edges won't stay down.
1,i bought this phone refurbished, i know that it should have been fixed, but it's not, the screen has a lot of dots which don't work. unhappy with this purchase
1,Doesn't come with adhesive!
1,Soooo... the reason it is a two pack is because only one works and you have to put both on to figure it out.  My girlfriend and I got this so we could protect the screen.  Hers works great but mine has a corner that pulls up every morning.  It is almost the entire corner that comes up.  I did both of the phones at the same time, same area, same method (the instruction method and preferred method), and have carefully applied all pieces.  But still, it is all jacked up.  I really feel like I wasted my money on this as only half of the package worked.  Should be half the price.
1,Wasn't easy to put on, Zagg did replace, I paid 10.00 for the upgraded version, but I ended us returning the phone by the time they shipped, when I asked for a swap of the unopened item they said they only do like for like so be aware.
1,No protection for your iPhone whatsoever. Cheaply made. Not recommend.
1,I've had this for a wew or two, seemed to be doing fine, but bubbles have started to form around the edges.
1,I'm not sure if this is a gag product or what.  The design and size of the solar battery is pretty nice, its small comfortable to hold, light, it comes in a nicely and well organized magnetically sealed box with seemingly everything you need but....  I bought 2 of these considering they were only $5 and neither of them hold more than enough charge to charge ANY of my gadgets for less than 1 minute.  Last night I left one charging via computer, and one charging via AC adapter for 14+ hours.  Both failed to charge any of the phones I have laying around (droid 4, droid, omnia) or my nexus 7 tablet for more than a few seconds.  The gadgets say they are charging, then within seconds they go back to not-charging and the light on the side of the "charger" that displays when the "charger" is being provided solar energy no longer illuminates until I plug it into the wall or computer.  So that tells me that whatever charge is being stored in this thing is getting completely wiped out in a few seconds of trying to charge anything.  I'm totally convinced this is not user error either as I've tried everything I could with BOTH units.  I wasted my money, don't waste yours.
1,The plastic belt clip on the outer case broke after a couple of week of gentle use. The pivot point is a thin piece of plastic that cracks too easy.
1,Im not sure what the sellers were thinking: sending a thin piece of glass in a 1/4 thick flimsy plastic display box inside a little padded envelope, and sending it halfway around the world.  Of COURSE it was broken.  I figured considering the cost involved and the hassle, it was not worth returning so I kept it.		I use my old iPhone to play podcasts at night when I cant sleep, so I was interested in a screen that reduces blue light, which tends to keep people awake.  I decided to install it even though it was cracked, and it installed without difficulty, with no bubbles or irregularities except for the hairline crack across the lower third of the screen.		Does it work?  Hard to tell.  The colors are not muted, and the blue icons appear normal, so I don't know much light is being filtered out, but its probably mostly UV light.  Im not sure how much UV the iPhone puts out anyway.  I think it may be mostly a placebo effect that makes people think this works.		Id pass on this.  Keep looking.
1,the case is solid. But I went thru 2 of the belt clips in 2 days. The piece that holds the clips on your belt is very flimsy and would never last ,ore than a week and it wouldn't matter who was wearing it. It would be a great set if they could beef up the clip.	I have moved on to another product as I have given up on this one.
1,The soft phone concept is cool but to use this headset you have to make it your default audio device for mic and speakers.  This means your regular speakers can't be used at the same time and switching involves control panel, sounds, reset default, etc.  you're not going to have time to do this when a call is coming in.  If you leave your speakers as default (cuz you spent a lot of money on them and love to use them for music, etc.) you can still use this device as the mic only.... but then your callers hear themselves talking with you.  Platronics tech support says you can adjust the volumes to minimize this but the end result is never business quality.  So.... unless you are ready to give up use of your speakers this item is a piece of crap!
1,Sad to say, but I loved this case at first and yet questioned the plastic sides gripping the phone.  After a few months of living in my purse, a bit of the side chipped off.		Hoping for the best, I was wishing that the rest could hold on.  It's now 4 months after the purchase and I need to say, this case doesn't last as a case.  As a wallet sure.  As a case for your s6, I can't recommend it.
1,It advertises as rubber . after receiving this in the mail and seeing it was cheap plastic , I threw it away . was not worth hassel of sending back . Do not buy this as it is not rubber .
1,I bought this specifically to rapid charge my Nexus 6P and it doesn't allow rapid charging. It will only allow standard charging, even when I use it in chargers that otherwise allow rapid charging with other cables. Not very happy.
1,This item took a long time to get here. Once it arrived  it did not fit my phone  it says it's for a Note 3 but there  is no way I can get it on my phone.  It's a shame too cause its a pretty  case.  I bought 2 one to hive as a gift so now  I am stuck with 3 useless  phone cases as its too much hassle and cost to return. Very disappointed  with this seller.
1,I felt it was kinda clunky and returned it.  Sorry, ...
1,Just okay an product... didn't last long
1,Not a good start when you open the packet and a piece immediately falls off.  The little gold bit that goes into the jack.  It doesn't seem to work well at all, I've had it "charging" and my phones charge symbol pops on and off, and my phones percentage has actually gone down.
1,Over the years ive bought around $5000 worth of anker products. Laptop batterys were one of the best, same for what they considered "gold" ac adapters. But this one went from working perfectly one day to showing charging but not putting out barely anything the next at about 12months and 1 week. I did buy the new quickcharge 3.0 charger that they also make to replace it but it does kinda make me wonder if going retail in the "biggest" store in the states has made quality go down.		Guess we will see what the next one does. If anyone has had a similar failure post a comment. Ive only ever seen this on cheapo drug store and gas station chargers before.
1,I bought this because it says "unlocked.  it is a lie.  it has an iCloud activation lock on it, meaning it was pre-owned and probably stolen.
1,Buttons don't line up with Black & Red nexus 5. Too much accidental pressing in pocket drain battery. Plus new buttons are not as smooth action while pressing.
1,The problem with this product is it is a very cheap quality piece that marginally accepts the phone inside the cover. everytime the phone rings you have to fully take the phone out of both layers to answer calls. I have figured it out the hard shell is actually touching the screen at all times thus making the task of answering a phone into a full fledge experience. Attempting to answer a phone before a customer hangs up! I did not keep either of the 2 Premium Heavy Duty Hybrid Case (Outer Silicone + Durable Thick Inner...  I purchased they both have been replaced by the Body Glove I feel duped in this transaction
1,The slider case was nearly impossible to put on the iPhone 4s - it was much too tight.  The case was also a very cheap plastic in a weird grey color - not a brushed chrome like color as is shown in the picture.  This just wasn't a good fit or a good quality at all.
1,the idea sound great . no metal plaque on my cellphone no magnet, but the adhesive surface is too strong, you would say thats good, yes i was thinking the same, until the surface with the adhesive breaks down and instead of staying on the mount, it stayed on my cellphone. also you need to wash it after few uses so the adhesive can work again, i didn't not hold my phone after few uses, after this fail i would say one with magnet work better than this one
1,I bought this full of high hopes for storing my Droid 2, because it wouldn't work with other cradles when it had a hard shell on.  I figured this "universal" stand would be perfect.  It just doesn't "cling".  I've paid attention to the instructions, cleaned the surface as recommended, but it is only mildly tacky, at best.  I have given up using it because it doesn't even work as a horizontal "shelf" for the phone -the ball joint slips, the clingo leans, and the phone falls off.  I'm happy for the people it worked for, but disappointed for myself.  I've decided to go with a "build it yourself" Lego stand, with inset magnet to start the multimedia app, which I've seen on the web.  Innovative, and cheaper.
1,Made where??
1,Would not recommend. The case is very loose and when you get it on mosteoporosis of the time cannot get the action button to click. Photo is also deceiving looks two colors but is just black. Will use when on the boat but no case rest of time
1,I cant make it stick to my screen it stays in place but moves around like if it's not sticky enough
1,It's a beautiful case but cut out for the power cord at the bottom of the case is too small to accommodate my anker cords.	Also, you cannot use any screen protectors with this case. I had to remove my tempered screen protector. Then I went and purchased a film version, and that also caused a fit problem.	I contacted caseology about these issues and their solution was simply to return it.
1,I'm very used to using holsters so was looking forward to getting this item. Unfortunately, this has a few major flaws. First, as you can see in one of the pictures, one of the holster arms covers the volume down button. If you slide the phone in the case down into the holster while unlocked, the button invariably gets pressed, meaning the phone goes to vibrate mode. Happens every time, so the button must be getting pressed whenever the phone (in provided case) is in the holster.	Second, the phone is very hard to get in and out of the holster. I was expecting a click in-click out mechanism, but this is designed to slide the phone in and out. There is a lot of friction between the rubber outside of the case and the lining of the holster.	On the plus side, the stand seems to work well.	Overall, pretty disappointed and will be searching for a replacement immediately.
1,This was a terrible purchase.  The outer shell doesn't hold anything together and the silicone is so flimsy to hold on well.  I have tried a lot of cases and this by far was one of two that I only left on for about an hour.  Oddly the other was a Ballistic case as well.  Don't waste your money.  Buy a Seido or Otterbox Commuter instead.
1,See the chrome lining? Yeah, it gave out after less than a month. It also really only protects the back also leaving the interface vulnerable.
1,Way too slippery
1,lasted one week
1,really like the phone. I thought it  looked good felt good in my hand I really wish it Had worked.:-(
1,It is of decent quality, but very difficult to turn your iPhone off.  Must press hard on the side button or your iPhone will stay on.  Looks good, but lacking in functionality.
1,They're cheap silicone cases that perform about as I expected. They slip on and off easily which is a plus if you want to change the color of your case, but it's a big minus if you're pulling the phone out of your pocket. The case partially comes off nearly every time. Again, though, I wasn't expecting much from such a cheap case.
1,returned
1,Cheap build. Not good for running. Doesn't snap as easy as one would expect.
1,I tried several places in my home and finally contacted Tech support at WiEx and learned that  " The unit is a simple amplifier so it pulls in signal from the window and re-broadcasts the signal around the base unit." And I was expecting to increase from 1-2 bars to 4-5 bars on my Verizon IPhone for the $200-300 the unit cost me.  So, if you have good signal outside your home but not inside, this unit will probably help. But if you are like me and you need a BOOSTER to obtain a better signal inside  your home, don't waste your time.
1,The Digitizer did not work. I took over 1.5 hours to fix this thing and nothing.. no touchy touch... So i ripped it apart thinking I could see if I didn't put it back together correctly.. nope.. another 40 mins lost..  so now i have to spend another 1.5 hours to rip this apart and put the old broken on to send it back this crap so that I can get a replacement AGAIN and spend another 1.5 hours..  to put it together again.
1,I got this to try it as a dock and also just to simply play movies through the phone at a friend's house.  I tried a 720p movie yes only 720 not 1080 and the sound track got way off track.  When playing without the dock the sound is just fine on the device.  Poor quality if you ask me.  Also no picture would display unless I rebooted the phone on the charger.  I'm not going to reboot my phone every time I bring my phone over to a friend's house to watch a movie.  I want to plug it in, watch the movie, and then unhook and pack up again.  Ordered an MHL 2.0 cable and hoping to at least be able to watch a movie with it.		It did seem to work with usb and hdmi at the same time, however who knows how long that will last.  What are you going to do, browse the web for a month before it goes out? Good luck if you get it.  USB OTG cable is enough to xfer something to the sd card.  Video is too glitchy.  Returned the item.
1,piece o'crap
1,snapped the cover on my phone days later the cover broke.  I am not happy that I have to purchase yet another case cover.
1,Honestly, this case is awful. It looks nothing like the picture. The mirror on the back doesn't fully cover the back of the phone, and it just looks awkward and weird. In addition, the ports on the bottom are horrible misaligned, so I can't plug in any pair of headphones because the plastic of the case goes right up to and a little over the edge of the headphone jack. Same issues with plugging in a charger, and the misaligned speaker holes muffle the speaker slightly. I honestly am having trouble believing that the positive reviews are legitimate. The only good thing I will note is that wireless charging still works with this case, which I had questions about due to the metallic backing.
1,Watched the video multiple times to ensure I was affixing the screen protector properly. It looked good the first day and after that the corners started to peel up. Eventually one of the corners got caught on my jacket sleeve and the protector was ripped off. Glad it was only $5.
1,Poor quality, it looks fine indoors but once you take it outdoors it's not clear, it makes the screen look cloudy and it is just not good to look at on such a beautiful phone. I removed it and threw away all the rest and ordered another type that is supposed to be more clear.
1,The pink part (which is rubber) picks up dirt like crazy. Its cute but won't last long because its going to look dirty fast.
1,BEWARE MY NOTE FOR  STARTED TRIPLING THE LETTERS NOT REACTING TO COMMANDS, SWITCHED PAGES. THE P L WOULD NOT WORK. AFTER WEEKS OF THIS I RECEIVED A NEW ONE. THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN I PUT IT IN THE CASE.	A STRONG MAGNET SEWN IN THE CASE WAS THE PROBLEM
1,This case is sleek looking, but it is absolutely not as advertised.  It states that there is a standby switch available to turn the battery pack into standby mode and there is not, there is only a single button on the back that displays 4 LED lights indicating how full the battery pack's charge is.  It also states that through the integrated Micro USB port, the phone and battery pack can be charged simultaneously and additionally allowing data transfer to/from the iPhone and computer.  This is also untrue.  My phone did not recognize the device at any time and the device never charged my phone.  When it was plugged in to my computer, the battery pack charged, but my computer never recognized that a device was plugged in.  I bought two of these and neither one worked.  Not only is the product description here false, the instructions that came INSIDE the package also claimed this same false functionality verbatim.  Seller was prompt and courteous and offered a refund right away.  I strongly recommend against this product.
1,fell apart
1,couldnt charge my phone!!! plug wouldnt fit with the case on!! beautiful color!! eye popping!
1,Screen didn't fit in the body.
1,Horrible screen protector.  The first one didn't stay on, so we used the second one and it didn't stay on either.  I am not sure how you were supposed to protect the screen when it didn't have enough adhesive on it.  Both screen protectors fell off within 24hrs.  Maybe it was a fluke, but I recommend looking for something else.
1,Plastic cheap
1,Made the screen look dirty and less quality. I thought my pictures were turning out horrible until the screen protector fell off. It was missing the tab to peel off the front protection when applying the protector to the phone
1,Quality seemed quite good and it worked well for 3.5 months but one morning the screen had up and down it.  Close examination revealed the glass had separated from one corner from the frame.  The liquid inside the screen was compromised.  I am very careful with my phone and I had good protective case.  Ive never had as teen peel off.  Its a shame the screen didn't last longer for the $30 I paid for it. Going to try another brand.
1,Waterproof but fingerprint scanner doesn't work. It's more annoying than anything. I contacted life proof and I followed their tech support instructions. They were going to replace it for me but I bought it from here even though their website is selling them through here.
1,This is more green than the teal color it looks like and it causes the buttons to hardly work. The company did refund my money, quickly and easily.
1,the battery I received had no nfc Antenna very cheap it was not made by Samsung It just had a Samsung label on it I told them my concerns and all they said was send it back that that's it .
1,In recent months, these screen protectors seem to have really gone downhill. I've actually tried to apply three of these in the past few months and have had issues with each one sticking to the yellow part of the plastic when I go to remove it in the last step of application. When it sticks, a ton of bubbles form and dust seems to instantly get in there. I was a huge fan of these screen protectors in the past and told most of my friends to get them but until something's done about this aspect of the packaging, I'm going to be looking for another, better brand.
1,Horrible chinese product that breaks easily
1,This was one of the cases my Husband got me for my brand new phone and although I liked that there was two layers of protection, the kickstand started wobbling within the first few days of use. If I shook my phone you could hear it clicking around. If this is what you can afford I say the price is right, but for peace of mind, it is totally worth it to spend the $22 on the Otterbox. You won't regret it.
1,I liked the color but this doesn't fit into my car vents. I had to give up trying to push it into the vents for fear of breaking the vent. Will definitely be returning this. However the rounded clamp part fits my phone which is much bigger than normal -- the Samsung Galaxy K Zoom which has a large protruding camera lens in the back.
1,Whenever I am on a call, the person on the other line has a hard time hearing me speak.  The volume control does not help adjust this for the boom is too far away from my mouth.  The paring between it and my phone took way too long to perform and still is not working right.  The first phone I tried using with it, continued to lockup every day after attempting the paring and new software on it did not resolve the matter.  The new phone is working better, but did not expect all these diversions that still do not have me working in a satisfactory manner.  Cool conception...just not working too well.
1,Horrible, font waste your money...
1,nunca me llego a destino
1,Alright so first off it comes packaged pretty well, and I was hopeful.  Open the package... The battery is scratched and scraped.  The blue back that comes with it doesn't even fit on the phone completely.... The white one fits but is dirty, looks used, and smells.  Absolutely regret spending money on this product.. To top it off due to my ignorance or lack of the option... I cannot contact the seller.  I bought this because there were great reviews about battery life etc... I hope this review makes you think twice before purchasing this... Save your money, and buy from somewhere else!!
1,It is too slippery.
1,The phone would be fine if it were new or even used but in good condition.  But instead they sent me what looked like a new phone but was obviously a rebuild of poor quality with tons of problems.  Bought this off Amazon and after having it a couple of weeks I finally used the headset plugin so I could listen to calls with earphones. Nope. Doesnt work. The connector where you plug your headphones in is clearly defective , likely broken away from the cell phone's motherboard and so it doesnt work. Several of the buttons stick too (but they work "OK"). Pretty much a rip off. I think with these rebuilds (or actually I think this one was even advertised as new), you get the luck of the draw. Some are going to work well and some don't. Mine doesn't. I lost out this time. So, just check out your entire phone very closely before you toss the packaging and before the timeframe in which returns are allowed expires and you might be OK...assuming they handle returns well. I wouldnt know since I didn't discover the major problems until it was too late.  My true advice is to not buy these cheaply priced phones on amazon where the deal is to good to be true. If it sounds too good to be true, the phone you get will likely have problems.		If the phone were new it would have its own flaw or two. Mainly the outside screen is so small...it's worthless. You really cannot use teh outside screen so just consider it as if you only have the inside screen. Think of it that way, and the phone (if it didn't have the "used" problems above, would be fine.
1,i don't like this stuffs i think when you buy it you gonna hate it  like i did so only thing is price and shipping, better stuffs if they fix it, i will be more happy next time.
1,AFTER I PUT IN LICENSE, AND I CREDIT CARD AND FONE, IT WOULDN'T SHUT TIGHT. RETURNED IT!
1,My main gripe that I have is that to recharge it, I have to use type-C. I was unable to charge it with Micro-USB. Overall it is a big battery, but if it is difficult to charge then the size of the battery is irrelevant. I can charge devices from both the USB and type-C, but the type-C wasn't fast charging like advertised. I admit that it charges faster than micro-USB, but it still says "charging slowly" and takes a fair bit to charge.		Edit 5/13/17: After 10 months and some pretty light use the battery began expanding. Not a great thing. I was unable to get a good picture of the bloating.
1,I had this charger (which is more costly than other similar chargers) and it worked for the first couple of charges with my phone and then stopped working. I would plug it into my phone and...nothing...no charge. Sent it back ordered another one and had the same issue.  Gave up for a while and then on a whim, ordered a THIRD unit, thinking that maybe it was just a bad batch. It was some time between the last one I ordered and the new one, but unfortunately had the same problem as the others. No charging of any kind. I learned my lesson and will not be buying the Jackery mini or any other Jackery product. Third time isn't a charm.
1,This case is extremely hard to put on!! Fits very snug once on phone tho. I don't care for how the charge port area is cut out.
1,Looks awesome but impossible to use any case because it pushes up he sides and makes huge air bubbles under the screen. Also caused the screen to go completely haywire tapping things I wasn't even close to and so on. Stay away
1,This does not fit the S7 properly. Will be returning.
1,This did not work for my purposes.  I found it too easy to slip off my belt so I did not use it very long.
1,Bought this because the other reviews for it were really good, and for the price I'd thought I'd try it out. I have another one (different brand Cool Stream), that works really well and this one is terrible. I use it upstairs in my kitchen area and if you move it more than 10 feet away from the receiver it starts to cut out.  I rarely leave reviews but I thought it was necessary to leave one for this product so another person wouldn't be wasting their money on it.  For this product it is worth the extra money to buy a more expensive version.		Update: After leaving my 2 star review, I did receive a new transmitter from the company but it still works the same the old one does.  They have a great customer service, and stand behind their products but unfortunately this product doesn't work that well at all. I have tried it in all three different iPod docking speakers I have.
1,Got it the first charger broke.. they sent a replace and it pop when I plugged it in. Not worth it. Scared the crap at of me.		Not replacing again
1,Ordered by mistake. Better options available.
1,it  was a  bag  off broke  part  and  miss part so  there  is  nothing  I can  do  with  that  junk
1,Not a fan. The rubber from the bottom lip is really loose. Love the blind and the color if it were plastic all over it would be better. But unfortunately it doesn't fit like described. Will be returning
1,Part of the black plastic cover has split, I have only had this case for less than a week. It happened while putting the the case on the phone. The plastic is so flimsy, it didn't stand a chance when trying to put the entire case together. Don't buy it!
1,1 star because they went backward. What are you thinking?  You have a hand up on apple and then you blow it and go backward by taking away the removable battery and also the SD card. All to add some money to your coffer. On top of this you cannot root the Verizon or AT&T Note5. I think some of these review are Fake, how could people praise this. My friend canceled his order because of this. You lose way more than you gain! Samsung I love your phones, the picture quality and touchwiz but I hate how you did this. This ones gonna bite back. You BLEW IT on this one!  I went to post this same review on Verizon Wireless and they would not post it because it would hurt the sales. If they won't post mine they won't post other bad reviews also. What a scam! Amazon is excellent at letting the public post true reviews!
1,I had this case for the whole life of my i5. I had to replace it only once. Which is a given. The case for the 6 does not fit and I can feel my phone moving around. Not very happy with the quality of it for it being a belkin. Maybe that's why verizon doesn't care it in stores for the 6.		I will be looking for this material feel but with a better fit for my next case.
1,I originally rated this product at a 4  because it looked and felt like great quality. the down side was that there was dust attached to the screen prior to ever taking it off the sticker pad. I was not able to get ride of it and it cause a very small bubble. I now give it a 1. This did not protect my LCD screen at all. The first time i dropped my phone the screen protector shattered and did nothing to protect my phone. I dropped it from a good 2-3ft distance. so disappointed i had to replace the phone, in less than 1 month...
1,Stopped working after a few weeks. Threw it in the trash. Maybe it was a bad peice; who knows? Stay away if you can.
1,total waste of time, tempered glass isn't even tough and leaves the edges of the screen exposed. In other words your screen isn't totally covered! waste of money and time
1,Very bulky and the side "clips" don't work well, popping open often.  It comes with a film for the glass but needed more tools to help get it on the screen smoothly.
1,Not a good buy very cheap looking....
1,Ok what I mean by cheap is the screen not the price. It works...for a while that is. A week after I installed it the white frame came unglued from the screen so I had to superglue it. Also the LCD screen itself has a weird look to it almost like water is in the screen but other than that it works. If you have a professional that would do it cheaper DO IT but if you need a quick fix to a broken screen then by all means buy one but maybe not this one...
1,this phone is a little big as it is and the case made it enormous. it was also very cheap plastic looking. and just to get it off the phone got scratched.
1,It would be better if the plastic its transparent!
1,This broke after a few days.  Also, the cover hindered the photo quality of the iPhone 4S and I wouldn't recommend. I did however like the look of the backing.
1,I bought this case for my iphone 4 and it literally looks exactly like the picture. I love the case as it's very pretty and sparkly BUT I won't ever be using it because if I drop my phone and it's screen up, it's going to shatter and I am not going to chance that. I am not familiar with cases especially when buying online so it's my fault. I would make sure you are serious about getting this though before purchasing because it's kind of spendy for the quality of it and it costs almost as much to return it so you will be out your money either way.
1,not good
1,Wasted my money, too cheap,  it broke on second day of use.  It couldn't stand the weight of an IPhone SE. Snapped in two on the windshield while driving. It ended on my trashcan on the second day out the box.
1,It's a good looking case. My phone fit very well in it. I didn't like how thin the front part of the case is, it comes off pretty easily. A short drop from the couch and that front part flew off. Another thing I didn't like is how the part where the stand is isn't flush with the rest of the case and sticks out not allowing the phone to sit completely flat. One major thing that bothers me, and is the reason I'm no longer using the case, is the case blocks my cell signal. I sat on the same spot with the case on and ran a speed test resulting in .5 - 2.3mbs. I ran the same test in the same spot after removing the case and my speed skyrocketed to over 20mbs. I attribute the drop in speed to the case anD I am now in the market for another case.
1,I must not have specified or noticed that the size was wrong...oh well!  and another seven words required.now two more
1,I love Spigen cases but their screen protectors aren't the greatest. Had a hard time getting the corners and edges to stick
1,This phone is so slow and freezes all the time its crazy
1,There are no instructions like most screen protectors. This one you have to peel one side and hope you can stick it on the screen fast enough to where no dust or particles can get under it and also making sure that it is aligned perfectly because if its not then you will have to re-apply it but then it fills with air bubbles that are impossible to get rid of and it ruins everything. Also, I don't think anyone (not even Nintendo) has made any screen protector that actually work well with a 3D screen such as the 3DS screen because even if you are able to apply it perfectly with no dust particles or air bubbles, screen protectors get scratched pretty easily, and if you have just one small scratch on it, you have to replace it because it ruins the whole 3D effect. (When playing in 2D, you don't notice it though.)
1,This looks very pretty.  That is why I gave it 2 stars.  Came with half the crystals fallen off.  Very cheap materials.  Three it out.  Glad I didn't pay that much for it.  Should have listened to the other reviews.
1,Ordered multiple units and all arrived intact. Took a long time to charge units. Received with approximately 43% charge and over 12 hours charge time required  to reach 100% with high speed usb connection. Attempting to register (and ensure an additional six months warranty) on the vendor website produced a large bounce.  No such website apparently exists. Of interest, looking to perhaps purchase more of these units, none are available except two used. Very strange. Hoping the units last and should they fail, no perceived safety net from the manufacturer exists. Cross fingers! A warranty is only as good as the company standing behind it. We don't even see any shadows. . .		Addendum. Units refuse to hold their charge with no load. Power loss rate at approximately 9% per 10 minutes plus unacceptably hot. Sent email to vendor. Contacted Amazon for permission to disassemble units. Batteries safely removed and all trashed. These chargers are potentially very dangerous.
1,Though its OEM product from Samsung. But quality is poor. The product didn't function consistently . Sometime it work fine sometime your TV loose signal. Manufacturing quality is very poor .Especially at joints where cable connect to connector is loose and 9 out of 10 time you have chances of damaging it.		Samsung should work on quality of their accessories.
1,It's not what they said, is what's it's, it looks like a toy phone
1,Code didn't work tried contacting review a few times now.
1,This didn't attach very firmly to my dashboard since it has a pebbled texture and is not flat. Mounting it on my windshield obstructed my view. This is a matter of the design and not the quality of manufacture. The product seems well manufactured however I ended up using a magnetic cellphone mount that is held in my CD slot. I don't use CD's anyways.
1,I had this for all of 2 weeks and it broke. I mounted it to the windshield in my car, plugged in the adapter, and didn't touch it again. 1 week later, it would charge only about 1/2 the time. last week, it stopped charging completely. i took it off the windshield and it made a rattling sound. turns out that the piece in the bottom that accepts the charger was completely off and floating in the charging unit. i can understand this happening if i was constantly unplugging and plugging it in, but i didn't touch it once i got it up there. not a good buy.
1,Consistently drops signal at only 10' from phone. Tried it with Iphone 5 se, Galaxy and kindle fire hd.  Purchased to replace the m55 but returned and will purchase the m55.
1,Didn't work at all.. Bad service
1,It's just about what I expected (i.e. nothing amazing, but a cheap gizmo to play around with), but unfortunately, the ball swivel directly below the phone holder is way too loose.  Unless the phone is sitting basically straight up, the weight of the device makes it unable to stick in the desired position.  I really am pretty disappointed, because this means I cannot really use it in just about any of the situations I had in mind when purchasing.  That being said, I could see this maybe working for a smaller phone than my LG V10.
1,Do not buy this! I've had two of them, and both broke around the charging port within weeks.
1,Battery runs down veey fast.
1,not compatible with the phone The housing is not matched
1,Very cheap case. Would not purchase again. Case feels like cheap rubber.
1,First time I tried to take the case it broke. Terrible product.
1,Do not waste your money this product does not protect anything
1,Not what I thought will be returning!
1,These are hit and miss on working most micro usb products. not worth the time to try each one to see if it works. will not buy again!
1,I received the wrong item. I ordered a "Dual SIM" phone and received a Chinese "One SIM" model... Besides, the manuals were in Arabic and the cable for charging was in a really bad shape. The box had the wrong stickers and because I'm abroad I can't return the phone. So, basically, I just have to deal with this...
1,he did not like it at all. well, that's my brother he did not like the quality I think that's all it.
1,Did not perform as I had hoped.
1,does not work well
1,It didn't open up as wide as it said and I didn't get it to hang on my steering wheel but to use it on a a stationary item in my car. It wouldn't expand wide enough to hold my LG Stylus so it is now in my junk drawer to fit some tool in some other location.
1,Case looks really nice. However plastic cracked after only 2 weeks of having the case. No drops to cause the cracks either. Just seems like cheap plastic, though there's not much more to expect from a <$20 case.
1,It doesn't fit properly, the cutouts don't match the phone, and it gets very dirty very quickly. It's a cheap case, sure, but I expected more.
1,Stop working
1,Loved this phone untill it died one day.
1,Keep in mind, at this time I had the iPhone4.  When I bought this product I knew it wouldn't be too good, but it could work "OK."  It didn't!  I charged this little thing and when I used it for my iPhone which was on around 25%, it only charged it 5%!
1,I like the privacy bit it's so darn dark that not even with the brightest setting on my phone can I see it well. I try to take a selfish and all I see is a reflexion. Good for privacy but not against me the owner.
1,Wrong item, Again was given a hard time to return it
1,It looks like this company is cutting a lot of corners to save money. There seems to be no quality control. I ordered this product twice. The previous order came with the spray-bottle less than half filled. The 2nd order came without the dust stickers.	The micro fiber cloth is a joke. The spray smells funny.		This screen "protector" is very difficult to install. Installation wise it's as bad as a normal screen protector. The "wet" install really makes no sense except may be preventing your fingerprints from getting in the way.		Oh, and the second piece was defective, one of the corners didn't stick at all. Considering everything I will stick with Armor Shield.		Returning and remembering for future reference.
1,Doesn't fit right
1,Black plate of the case came off
1,did not fit
1,Returned case. Not what I thought it would be.
1,2days of in bed use, and the cord is already crimping through the reinforced area, near where it plugs into the phone. I am VERY disappointed.
1,Didn't get to use it. Because it didn't fit on my S4.
1,Very bad concept for phone "case"
1,Not easy to use.  I'm sure there's a better design out there.
1,Great cable, strong braided material, no problems syncing, I am probably going to buy another.		Update 9/15/16:	About 15 months later the cord is pretty shot. The MFI chip is bad or something. I guess it has been going out for some time now but I just realized that it wasn't the brick but the cord that was bad.
1,Color looks like orange, not red. Power and volume buttons difficult to push.	Spend more money and buy a real Apple case.
1,Didn't fit
1,I've purchased this brand before and really liked it for the iPod touch 5th generation, but for the Samsung S7 - not the edge-- it's small and the bottom part doesn't even stick to the screen.  With the protector slightly smaller than the screen, it's a bit irritating with the edges not quite right.  Not sure if the quality has gone down as this was my original 'go to' protector, but now will need to look at others.
1,This is a scam the picture doesn't even show up I didn't keep the cases very disappointed in  it didn't even fit my phone
1,fake, not a MI band. Why is this listing still up?	I have to pay to ship it back to China!	DO NOT BUY!
1,I've purchased Invellop cases in the past and have always been pleased but after very light use, this one is bubbling up and the material is separating itself from the cardboard (or whatever material that is) inside.  Don't use my iPad too much so I can put up with it but would have expected more from Invellop.
1,I want to like it but it didn't fit my Apple Watch Series 2. As you can see in my pictures, the fitting around the crown is not right, not allowing me to compress/push my button down. The speaker/microphone holes on the side are covered. Maybe this works well for series 1, but I don't recommend for the 2nd series.
1,Heats up your phone a Lot and doesn't charge up past 60%
1,Not fully clear
1,Do not buy! It does not fit with a case on! Even the tough armor does not work it will bubble in the corner! Look elsewhere.
1,It is not for me, I don't like it at all, too plastic, over sized, it doesn't match the cuteness of the S6 edges.	I do not recommend it for someone looking for something cute.	I am very disappointed and I am not using it either, I will try return it and will see if that will work or not either way I will not carry that around for sure
1,Looks great. That's about it. I used it for about 2 days and the retraction mechanism started jamming. This one is being returned. The cable looks like high quality but the retraction mechanism and housing look cheaply made/assembled. Oh and its big compared to the other ones out there
1,alot of these either didn't work or didn't work for long
1,I have been using this case for a month now and I thought it was working out mostly well, until i decided to really look it over again so I could review it. It doesn't seem like it has held up so well, which is surprising because Belkin usually makes good quality products. The black coloring has peeled off and the case has somehow developed a crack in it. I am not sure when or how the crack actually occurred because the phone has not had any significant drops or falls at any time during the last month. It has not fallen or been dropped on any hard surfaces whatsoever. It is always kept in a pocket or purse, so it really isn't ever exposed to any extreme conditions or environments, either. After checking it out now after a month of fairly light to normal use, i would have to say that I wouldn't necessarily recommend this case unless it is dirt cheap and/or you don't mind replacing it fairly soon.
1,Glass doesn't look clean at all, I applied it in a dust free area and just short after the screen gathers a lot of dust/lint. Also it began raising up after a month or so, I have the 2nd one still but i won't be applying it. Only plus side was that it did come off smoothly
1,I'm a guy and it wasn't for me because it was too slippery it gets dirty but it this could be a precaution from dropping your phone a lot
1,Was very hard to put on. I don't care what anyone says. The first one messed up right away bubbles everywhere. I lifted it up BIG mistake and then lint started to get in needless to say it was a total failure. The second one had 2 or 3 bubbles but I could live with it.
1,never worked tried everything other review's said. I have a note 4, Samsung s5 and a note 7... none of them worked!!!
1,this charger is terrible! it worked for only a few weeks and when it finally stopped working and i wen to pull it out from the car a piece broke off was stuck in the car! to make matters worse it started sparking and letting off ambers while i was driving. i had to take my car to a mechanic to get all the sparking pieces removed. This charger is the worst!!!!
1,After two weeks the wires came out of the connector.
1,Garbage. Kick stand does not even work
1,not very good
1,Product appeared to be okay and I liked it but after a month one of the clips broke off the band where it connects to the Blaze frame.  I didn't abuse the band either.  I could not repair.  I have sent several emails to vendor and was supposed to get a replacement but still have not received one.  I was actually getting ready to order a black and a blue band from this vendor but I guess I will look elsewhere.
1,The only problem with this can of color is get dirty to fast
1,The glass did not cover the screen- there was a huge gap! Also bubbled and wouldn't stay on my watch and it seemed to slide around. I am not happy, just threw it away and will try something different. Should have read the reviews!
1,I purchased an Otterbox for my Blackberry Pearl and LOVED it.  Great for harsh environment.		The Otterbox for the Blackberry Storm was very disappointing.  I was unable to use any buttons on the edge of the touchscreen.  The edge of the case was too close and too high.		In addition, the sound from the microphone and speaker are muffeled.  I had a hard time hearing and had complaints from people I was talking too.		I recommend Otterbox for other phones, but definitely not the Blackberry Storm
1,I bought 2 of these in 2015 they worked great so I bought another 1-year later in 2016 but it simply did not work no matter what USB "port," or box I put it in it would not charge my iphone7plus
1,Theoretically, this is supposed to make the image sharper, right?  It actually looks worse than using the stock RCA connector to me...
1,stopped working after only a few uses \:
1,First phone arrived DOA.  Returned, could not get another at the same price (deal of the day).  Bought a 2nd one.  That one ALSO DOA.  Returned again, will not buy this phone and not from this seller again.
1,Regular
1,Had to return this. Did not work well with my Samsung note 5. Phone had to be positioned just right and easily lost the connection if the table was bumped or phone moved slightly. Much easier to just plug it in with the regular cord. I do have a case in my phone but it's a very thin one and I followed the guidelines for the charger with no luck.
1,The Fitbit One just doesn't work accurately this way. Don't waste your money.
1,DID NOT WORK WELL PHONE HAS GLICHES
1,No body could hear me or understand what I was saying.  That is using the Jabra in my office at home with no background noise.  It went right back to Amazon.  Save for time and money.  I like the Plantronics Margue 2. Crystal clear on both ends
1,SEE PRODUCT PICS ABOVE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY!	I received an obviously counterfeit item. The fit and finish on the unit I got were laughable. The seams on the front where the top and bottom pieces "fit" together were so bad It looked like one was from one device and one from another, completely out of whack. I sent the unit back for a replacement.		Amazon replaced the item with a HORRENDOUS imitation, much worse than the first. The unit arrived in an envelope, in a baggie. With the USB cable held together with a twist tie. Not kidding. I didn't even open it. I did take several pictures of it because I am in complete disbelief Amazon even allows this junk on its website. Beyond the obvious FAKE-ness of the whole thing, the unit was nicked and scratched.		I FINALLY got the item I wanted in the first place--when I walked into the Apple Store and bought it. I found out from the Mophie representative that NO ONE EXCEPT APPLE sells the Juice Pack Air featured in Apple Stores and on the Apple website. It is a completely different and far superior design.		--The Apple unit has the top completely open for ease of use with any headphones and easy access to the power button	--The seam between the two pieces is at the bottom instead of the top, and their is no gap at all between the two	--You can remove the bottom piece to easily dock the phone in an Apple accessory and still have the unit protected by the snug snap-in case that is the top piece.	--The unit itself is sleeker and not at all bulky like the one sold by Mophie and Amazon.	--Due to customer comments, the LED lights do not stay on constantly while charging via the USB cable. You just press the button to check the progress.		I was told by Mophie that Apple designed their own version of the Juice Pack Air specifically to Apple standards that is available only through Apple directly.		Forget ordering elsewhere, and get it straight from Apple. The difference is night and day!
1,the case is sturdy but the charge port won't fit. so you have to take the case off to charge the phone.
1,Very flimsy and graphics are horrible
1,Belt clip on case too light weight, falls off too many times to be useful.  If you plan to use belt loops it might be okay.
1,Item arrived and tested on samsung galaxy s4 and it does not fit properly, its too loose, and does not provide adequate protection.
1,Seemed like a great idea until you add cards to the wallet. Designed to hold many when the truth is if you start to go more than three, you need to be careful as there is a lot of pressure going on to the screen which may cause it to crack. Cheap wallet case for sure but poor design.
1,So I got this device because it's branded samsung but this device does not work for me. It connects easy but does not keep a connection. It's seem as if it needs to be in direct sight of the connected device for it to work. I tried to stream music but have to hold phone up to my shoulders for it to keep connection. I will be returning this.
1,Admittedly, have used this only with my Android phone (Moto Razr Maxx) but have experience with this phone using a number of bluetooth devices.  There seems to be an issue with connectivity with this phone.  By that, I mean music played over this phone will often be broken up and unlistenable.  I would have to turn the device off and back on.  Or turn off bluetooth on the phone and then back on.  Sometimes it would take 2 tries until the music is clear and plays normally.  When it does connect fine, the device has plenty of range--up to 10 feet until a hiccup is detected.  I like that you can use any set of headphones as the stock ear buds do not fit me well (too small).  The clip works well, and you can use any micro usb charger to charge it.		PROS:	-when it works, seems to have good range	-can use any headphone with it	-clip works well	-easy to charge with any micro usb charger.		CONS:	-connection poor with Moto Razr Maxx often, requiring OFF/ON cycle or two.	-battery life acceptable but not great.
1,I hate this thing.		I needed a stand so badly because I FaceTime with relatives abroad.  This is not what I'd call a stand.		It falls, & it doesn't stay standing up when a phone without case or any extra weight added to it.		I'll buy another stand, but not this one!
1,This product fully charged will only charge a cell phone to max 10% of it battery capacity and takes forever to re-charge. Not a food product to invest.
1,Perhaps the simplest yet the most good looking clear case in the market, as it's thin and allows show off all the nice S7. However, after using it for a while, a couple of comments:		- it still kept the transparency and shows very few scratches - shows quality of materials in use	- unfortunately it "marked" back glass of my S7 with small dents in the lower bottom edges, probably due rigid part of case rubbing the back continuously.	- an additional comment, the whole case is turning yellow, not looking so great after an year of use.		My overall experience is just average, and I'll switch back to my Spigen Thin Fit: it's black and hides the phone, but fully protects it.
1,Neat case
1,Did not work, installed, followed directions. Even drilled a hole to let it sit outside...failed completely!!
1,Bad quality
1,So I initially bought this believing there was a notch for the camera. That is not the case, the protector is flat across the front camera. Note to customer service who was very prompt and even sent me another one, exact same, to assure me I had the right one.		So both applications of the screen protector was touch and go. They both ended up with halos around the edge where the curve starts. I figured that happen. The first protector I put on did it's job. It was dropped on the screen face down while camping on a rock, cracked but saved the screen.		Second protector I put it on, again halos but now it has a huge air bubble right over the front camera, very annoying, does affect photos, but okay deal with it, it's protecting my screen. Several weeks of it being on, and for some reason it's mysteriously started chipping at the edges and causing a crack across the screen.		It does it's job, however will not be repurchasing.
1,It didn't stick to the dash of my wife's Jeep. She keeps it clean with Armor-All. The dash was dry and not greasy, but it slid right off. Yet, if you throw it against the wall, or even your brother's back, it sticks like glue! Go figure. I'm 60 years old. I know what this thing is made of. Remember the toy black balls of Flubber? You could mold it and stretch it, and throw it against anything and it would stick. It also picked up every bit of dust and lint in the house. Impossible to get clean. That's what this thing is! We hated the feel of this sticky thing and it started to get dirty after only a few minutes. We certainly didn't want to put our expensive Fire Phones in it. We threw it out right away. It was so cheap that it wasn't worth the gallon of gas to take it to the UPS store.
1,Good case but the clip was not good. Came apart twice so he finally threw it out.
1,Case exterior looks great but is WAY too slick.  I had to put beads of super glue all up/down the sides and the back for some extra tackiness/grip.  Now, it works great but disappointing I had to modify the thing instead of it being good to go out of the box.
1,It's too tight. While it does fit the mouse, once I've jammed the mouse into it, it's very difficult to pry the mouse out of it again.
1,They all broke on me
1,After reading some reviews I should have been warned. I used it on that window, to which it stuck quite nice and never fell or moved. The device however... I attached a 4in MP4 player. Now this was not a heave device nor a large one. It was no more then a cell phones worth weight and size. The back plate is brushed aluminium and non porous.		 20 min down the road and from the back seat my son starts to say, "cars", which means his movie was no on. Low and behold the player was on the floor of the car. I tried to reattach it and another 15min down the road same thing.		Now if you used a plastic backed device or anything "plastic" you might have better success.		All in all it cost me a cup of coffee, so I'm only a little butt hurt over the whole thing.
1,I have been using this for the past year and change around the house and when I travel for business. Initially was very impressed and used it a ton. I really like the LED display telling me how much juice is left.		Then the problems started. One port went out completely. Ok, fine...I have 2 more to use. Shortly after that, of those two remaining function ports, they randomly quit working and then next time they might. Sometimes, none of the ports work. It is very frustrating. I sucked it up for as long as I could, but broke down a few weeks ago and bought a different brand battery to replace this one. When I need power, especially when traveling, I need it. I use my phone for tethering, email, music, etc. I have had quite a few batteries over the years as I travel a lot for business and NONE of them has been this inconsistent and frustrating. I still use the old ones to charge from my solar panels and the family uses them around the house to charge high drain devices like phones and tablets. This one has been relegated to my office drawer until i figure out a way to dispose of it. A waste of money.
1,If you're looking for a protection of your phone this is not it. It doesn't cover your phone at all its dumbest case I have ever seen mine even cane broken and Amazon threatened me in the past for their own mistakes so I just  have to deal with my loss.
1,Case looks awesome, one of the best that I've seen.  However, it's plastic and it'll do 'barely' anything to protect the front glass of the iPhone (it's not aluminum either).  I'm happy with the case but wish it gave more protection to the front glass.
1,Terrible sound
1,This case is definately not for someone who is looking to do more than protect their phone against scratches. It is extremely thin, so thin when it's not on your phone it is slightly transparent. It has a cool feel to it, but I am a clutts. Ive dropped my phone and not only did the screen break, but the case has broken in multiple different areas. i had to tape my case..my iPhone 6 looks ghetto. If you drop your phone even an average of twice a week on anything like tile, please do yourself a favor and don't buy this case. My screen is already cracked, I'll repeat that, my iPhone 6 screen, less than three months old, is cracked.
1,UPDATE on 23 June 2013: I've revised this to 2 stars instead of 1 star because i'm holding out hope that Samsung/Virgin will get issues resolved w/a new OTA update at some point.  But since updating to jb, i've had nothing but problems with this phone.  It's a shame because, as you can see from my glowing review from before (the part that follow this updated review) I really liked the Reverb when it was running on ICS.  but now it freezes up at lockscreen with regularity and, worse, I suddenly lose all my internal (rom) memory!  I called Samsung tech support and supervisor said they know that the update is not working for this phone but he couldn't be sure when a fix would be issued.  I would NOT buy this phone unless/until they figure out how to make it right again.  What a shame that a once reliable phone is now the cause of so much frustration.  I feel like I've lost all the $ put into buying this phone and accessories for it.  I'm hoping Samsung will stand behind its product and do right by its customers.  and SOON.  Depending on how this gets resolved, I may not even be sticking with Virgin.  I've read many recent reviews on their site w/ppl complaining that Virgin is only replacing phones with refurbs that have same problems.  (that's because it's the new OS that's the problem and until that software/firmware is resolved, nothing else will fix it)  This phone would be better off if they just returned the OS back to ICS, but I doubt they'll do that.  Again, steer clear of this phone.  The recent negative reviews are true.  You've been warned .........		OLD REVIEW:Got this phone during Black Friday sale for hundred bucks so couldn't justify paying 3x that for the newly released Galaxy S2.  This phone has not disapointed, esp coming off the LG Optimus V. It's an upgrade in every possible way.  ICS is great and, while the 2gb of internal memory that's available isn't spacious by today's standards, it's still plenty for loading up a raftfull of apps n games.  The 1.4ghz processor is more than serviceable and  can handle even  some of the more demanding games on the market such as Dead Trigger w/nary a lag.  I liked the physical build features of my old Optimus V and this phone shares a number of them:  there's an actual camera button, a solid volume rocker, an external microsd card slot that isn't hidden under the battery cover and the power button on top has worked w/out a single glitch (some others have reported that it sticks but, thankfully, not the case with my phone) The 4" screen is very good tho could have a little more contrast.  (this is where the GS2 woiuld prob really outshiine the Reverb w/bigger Superamoled screen)  Still, overall this display  is just fine.  My poweramp music player sounds just great pumping music through the single speaker on back, as do other apps like Google Music and TuneIn radio.  Battery life has also been more than adequate, going most days on a single charge.  Have also heard that this phone now has root access so that's another positive for those looking to go custom rom route.  Adding a case and screen protector (liquid iq shield) has  made this phone feel very solid and safe.  It also accepts 64gb microsd card. (just insert in phone w/nothing more to do.)  Regarding that pesky "ID pack download" that is always ready to install, I finally installed it w/no damage done.  I just returned to my Nova Launcher as deafault.  Didn't seem to take much internal memory away either, which was my main fear.  (I didn't download any additional ID packs tho, either)  Finally, call quality is excellent!  Can't comment much about the camera as I've not taken many pix but it does have a nice UI and from what i've read, is pretty decent.  All in all, this 3G phone from Virgin is very solid and a great value!
1,Worst screen ever did not adhere
1,suction cup has come off my windshield twice, causing my $600 phone to come crashing along with it.  The release button works but has caused the arms to become off center, so one side is further out then the other from the middle base.  This is good for a long trip if you go on one, but extended use it'll break on ya.  I've used it now for around 5 months approx 3-5 nights a week and it serves it's purpose excluding the flaws listed.
1,broke first drop
1,The rubber siding peeled up, Lasted 30 days, Just past Amazons eligible return date, Belkins website, No way to contact anyone, no email, no phone, Nothing ... All dead end links, will NOT be buying any Belkin products from here on out ! JUNK !
1,Cable is decent price but are poor in quality. The tab that locks the cable in are shallow and stop functioning after a few uses.
1,Please don't buy this phone for it's water "resistant" properties. They won't work in the long run. My phone washed out in 8 months in spite of taking all precautions. since its a sealed device Sony can't repair it and since the indicators say water damaged Sony won't honor the warranty. I've given up after pulling hair with Sony Service - not what I expected of a $600 device and from a big brand like Sony
1,Doesn't fit, because the rounded edges on nexus, th should not sell this if the can make it right
1,Disappointed in this product. The film was quite scratched when I took it out of the package, and it has become worse in the two days it was put on. I haven't dropped the phone. The phone has been in my purse most of the last two days.i would not recommend. 5/9/16 I put on the  second screen protector and am having the same problems: the protector scratches very easily and the right side keeps coming unstuck. The left side is fine; therefore,  I wonder if there is a manufacturing defect with the product.
1,didn't fit
1,I got it because it was different and I liked the little belt clip that comes with it.	The belt clip comes off very easily and not secure, and the magnet really messes up hotel key cards ( I travel often), its neat and original, but overpriced for what it is.
1,I bought this to take on a cruise where power sources would be scarce for charging my Samsung Galaxy S3. It arrived right before we left. I could not get my phone to recognize that it was plugged into a power source. I called the manufacturer but was only told that it needed longer to fully charge so that a full blue light showed across the top. I allowed it to charge for about 7 hours. The light was a solid blue (not flashing), but still wouldn't charge my phone.  I tried again about 3-4 times on my cruise & nothing. It charged my husband's crappy dumb phone, but not my phone.  Very disappointing.
1,not very good,  did not last very long 4 months
1,The tools are all quite flimsy. Both of my pry tools broke while trying to open up an iPhone 5
1,Battery life is around 6-7 hours on one charge. The charging case is a nice touch when traveling. The only reason I took off one star (it really should be a half-star) is because of the need to use the proprietary dongle to charge directly from the charging cable. Again. you can connect the charging case directly to the cable without a dongle, but if you don't have the case with you, the only way to charge is with a dongle.		Update: The unit started sounding funny/muffled on the other end several weeks ago. I went to the Plantronic forums and tried the recommended tricks, resetting connections etc. In the end, I finally determined that it needed to be replaced. Contacted Plantronics and was told that I was 1 week past the allowable time (1 year) for replacement. They will not replace it, but will sell me a refurb for $50. Sooo, goodby Plantronics. I have purchased my last product from you.
1,I guess you get what you pay for. A few dollars- for a product that is made in China for pennies. Neverthless, if you want to protect your phone this case isn't what you are seeking. Made of cheap-breakable plastic- one drop-and the the whole thing shall break and probably break your phone as well.	Invest a few dollars more and get a reliable case.
1,I bought this for my daughter because she wanted something shiny and jeweled-like. However I was disappointed. The case seems very cheap and it wouldn't snap togeher to close around the phone. When it did close it was hard to open and take off without feeling like you're going to break it.
1,Color rubs off easily.
1,Bad/low quality charging  cable gives error messages..
1,Doesn't hold a full charge
1,I had to return this power stick as after a few days the digital read out kept flashing the same number.  I couldn't get it to go away or change so it defeated the purpose of having a digital readout if it didn't work properly.
1,The case is nice, but the rubber doesn't fit tightly on the phone, so not very good protection.
1,It looked nice, was cheap, and the pins worked well. But after a couple of days the metal started bending UI around the edges. The points are sharp and scratch it snag anything and anyone they run across. Not worth it.
1,The Keylink just doesn't work very well. First, for anything to work your phone has to be on and the Keylink and your phone need to be less than 100 feet apart (or less when indoors through walls etc.). Second, even when in range, the Keylink was constantly randomly disconnecting from my phone. Third, my first Keylink's battery only lasted a month and a half; the second one did much better (probably because I put in a new battery when I got it instead of keeping the crappy one it came with).		So... If you want a doodad to hang on your keychain that will *sometimes* let you avoid having to enter a PIN on your phone, or *maybe* find your keys or your phone but only if they're already very near you, go ahead and buy this, and make sure you install a fresh battery. Or better yet, don't bother and save your money!		P.S. Dealing with Motorola to get a warranty replacement for my first Keylink was a hassle. It took two email exchanges and two phone calls over four days, but at least the new one shipped fast. I wouldn't have bothered if I had known the replacement unit was also going to be a dud.
1,Pretty flimsy, and was too loose to work with my wife's arm.  I think it would fall apart pretty quickly if you aren't willing to do some stitching to repair the poor quality.
1,If the quality of the product reflects the quality of service than I would never recommend this product. Will be returning for sure.
1,I did not like the team. very bad software. laguea it all the time. too much publicity. I do not recommend this phone.
1,The headphone turn up thing doesn't go all the way so it will let stuff get in phone my biggest thing was screen would get dirt or. Hair or lint under screen but because of that little speaker (headphone jack) screw up jax thing the case sux
1,Screw drivers and plastic opening tools are quality items but the tweezers and exacto-knives are very flimsy and at times somewhat useless. The exacto-knife blade would not fit securely into the compression fitting and thus would move around during cutting. It was kind of a safety hazard. The tweezers were flimsey sheet metal cut into "tweezer shapes." Overall, the screw drivers were worth the $8.35
1,I noticed it did not last as long as the one that came with the phone even after the break in period. I haven't had the battery 2 months and it is starting to swell so I can no longer use it because it is a danger to myself and others at this point. Waste of money...
1,This is basically a very cheap plastic case.. if you want to be cheap... go for it. The case always unsnaps itself randomly for no good reason. You have to somehow put it on just the right amount to get it not to unsnap. However, you still can easily unsnap the case off and I'm just glad the phone hasn't fallen out yet. The swivel clip is also very very hard to press down and take out the phone... You are going to have to have your fingers pushing on both ends of the clip in order to get the phone out of the clip. This is annoying when trying to answer a call or trying to get to a text message. The only pro about this product is that it's cheap.
1,These peopl suck
1,This product will cover your Iphone but quickly looses its elasticity and will begin to fall off of your phone within a month or two of using it.  It is cheap.
1,I was disappointed that this case doesn't have a clip on it.  It's my own fault for not noticing.  Case is lightweight and snaps on easily.
1,Too cheap materials
1,Not worth the buy. The cover won't adhere to the screen to stay on. They give you 3 for a reason.
1,GARBAGE!! BE AWARE. BROKE AS SOON I PUT IT ON
1,Does not fully protect the corners.  My wife got this for her phone.  Looks cool but the screen broke when she dropped it on its corner.
1,I've never seen such a bad case design, overall.	The case is sloppily built, poorly conceived and simply doesn't for the device correctly. The power button built onto the device completely denies use of the Nexus 6's power button and in fact holds it down so the device restarts. No amount of tweaking worked.	Poor quality, poor design, poor overall.
1,I'm sure this charger could be satisfactory but it will not be of any use to you if you have a case on your S5. I work outside therefore I need to have an Otterbox on my phone and can't utilize this in that configuration. I should have thought it thru better prior to purchasing, it just doesn't work for me at this time.
1,Update: 04-18-2016 - Took a road trip. Camera is hard-wired into the car, memory card is a SanDisk Ultra 32GB Class 10. I know about the folder (sub-director) structure the camera uses. The camera "forgot" to record about 4 hours of a 10 hour trip.	I am now looking for a new camera. This one is unreliable for even non-emergency recording. I have the thing set to 1 minute recordings to prevent it from stalling while updating so it -should- work but it does not. My advice, even considering the rather nice design of the camera is to avoid this product if you are looking for a reliable camera. I changed my review to One Star.		Previous Review:	Product works well when it works correctly.		It is unreliable.		It occasionally indicates recording but no files are written to the memory card.	It occasionally refuses to turn-off when power is removed. (requires a Reset)	It occasionally refuses to turn-on. (requires a Reset)	It occasionally makes all the sounds of turning on but then does not record. This requires the vehicle operator to check the operation of the camera every time they start the car. I would rather be looking at the area around me and operating the car than checking on a camera (cell phone, radio, or any other device that detracts from operating the car)	The push buttons become unresponsive. (requires a Reset, thank goodness that button works)	It has problems with contrast. If you drive down a tree lined road, the bright sky causes the camera to under expose the recorded image resulting in a black and white image wherein you can't discern items in the dark areas. All shadows and sky. This is not resolved by adjusting the exposure setting. The auto-exposure takes over and you have a bad image again. I have not found a way to defeat the auto exposure function.	It makes noises that can not be turned-off.	It records some files as "Locked" files and others as unlocked even with sensitivity set to the lowest setting. It places locked files in a Folder titled "RC" within the Folder holding the unlocked files.	(opinion; all files should be in the same Folder regardless of locked/unlocked status.)	The camera sometimes takes longer than 3 minutes to close a recording before starting another. This can be minimized by selecting the one minute interval but this also creates hundreds of tiny files, wasting memory space (read about sector size and file size issues with the FAT file system.) This one-minute setting is also difficult to manage when reviewing the files (movies) stored on the card. Special software other than a simple player application is required to con-cant the files into a manageable video segment. When con-canted, the video contains overlaps where the camera started a recording while still recording in the current file.	The camera has problems with reflections from other cars. Sunlight or an on-coming headlight cause blooms in the recorded image.	The optics are distorted (as required by wide-angle or "fish eye" optics) and poorly handle the already poor optics of the windshield. This is not fully the fault of the camera but the optics designers should have put more effort into dealing with the windshield as all of these cameras will be required to record images through a windshield.	The frame rate is poor for highway driving. At 60 miles an hour the car travels about 3 feet between each recorded frame in the video. The playback looks like a 8mm movie from the 1960's.	Considering the price and intended application for this product I find it acceptable, marginally acceptable but acceptable.
1,barely holds enough charge to get to 50% on the tablet battery.  Unimpressed, a waste of money.  would not recommend.
1,Difficult to install, makes typing harder, and despite following instructions I ended up with finger smudges.  The worst part is that THIS IS NOT TRANSPARENT, it has a weird grainy effect that degrades the display and makes it look like a low-resolution screen on a really old phone.
1,The case didn't close all the way, so I didn't even bother to test it for water leakage. And beyond that the clear front didn't seal to the screen so it made typing really difficult because it didn't touch the surface everywhere unless you pushed down harder. Plus, it was a nightmare with finger prints. I loved the look, but that was about it.
1,This item does not really hold the Kindle Fire very well and after a few tries, quite using it.
1,Pretty color but horrible product. It breaks off piece by piece for no reason. I haven't dropped it but it's slowly falling apart. It hasn't even last 2 weeks
1,I have installed screen covers on about a dozen devices now, so while not a pro I'm not a complete novice either. Unfortunately this was my worst ever - the first two attempts got misaligned and made a huge bubble over the home button - trying to readjust was hopeless as that just resulted in more dust and bubbles. The third went on with the right alignment, however due to the Samsung S7's slightly curved edges (this is not the edge model) the film doesn't fit perfectly.		However, even after what I consider my worst application of film ever, which still took 3 attempts (i.e. all 3 sheets of film) the feel of the film is horrible and far sticker than any other film I've applied. I will probably replace this with something else.
1,arrived late, and it brook on the first day,
1,I'll start by saying I don't like cases on my phone.  But looked at this case because it was recommended by someone who seems to drop their phone in a lake quite a bit.  I will admit, it worked great for water proofing.  My problem was how bad the touch screen became with this on it.  Maybe other cases do the same thing, but I couldn't deal with having to touch/swipe multiple times for something to happen.
1,Thought the kickstand was also a belt clip (I got this impression from someone's review).  I wrote to the seller to point out the confusion about this and suggested they check out the review and maybe clarify no belt clip in this products discription.  Never did receive a reply from seller.  Product itself is flimsy.  Threw it in the junk drawer.  Bought a naked shield for moto g 3rd gen.  With the belt clip.  Arrived today.  Much better product.
1,Got my phone wallet  it today let me say it seems very nice it looks really nice but you can tell that the zipper is not going to last long and I want to put my phone in the holder and the holder is so tired of my phone it is pushing on my side buttons not happy at all with it
1,It lost its adhesiveness not long after placing it on phone, even cleaned the way it was supposed to be, then completely fell off both phones we used it for
1,I have a new s7 phone.  This csse is too big as phone slides in case.  Case made of plastic and falls off when phone is dropped.  I bought a previous case from same company for  s6 edge plus that was snug and metal, that never fell off when dropped.  I loved it now, looking for a replacement.
1,Nice cord, but when you order a 2 pack they only sent me on
1,Horrible never buy an aukey charger
1,Was great when it worked.  Would have given it 5 stars then but after 6 months, it no longer works properly.  When I plug my smartphone in with the wire, there is only sound playing on the right side of my car speakers.  No sound from the left.  If I play with the position of my phone, the sound comes back but one slight move and the sound is gone again.  Not sure if this has a warranty.  Will call company to see if there is one and if they will honor it.  These things aren't cheap at over $20 a pop and should last longer than 6 months.
1,The battery will last a long time, but for 18+ hours, it'll be at 1%. This means that the screen is dim and you can't use the camera. After many full drains and full charges, it only stays at 1% for about 8 hours. Just a major headache. Zerolemon needs to make an app that adjusts the settings to fit the battery.
1,After having it on for a few days the skin is almost falling off the phone it would be way better if it was tighter
1,dropped case and it broke so the fluid(oil like substance) leaked  out everywhere, very disappointed and i can not return it.
1,I asked a few questions to make sure this case was the iPhone 8 Plus version  of the case today I received my keys in the mail and it was for a iPhone 7 Plus  The Apple logo in the back doesnt line up properly  im seriously disappointed utility Im a fan of these cases But is this some kind of joke when you order and iPhone 8 Plus case and receive last years version of the case
1,I hope this works, I just got this so I haven't used it yet but there's a bad smell to it, I really hope it holds up for me at the gym.
1,I didn't even get to use it once before it stopped working . Do not buy this ! It is not work the money or the wait . TRUST ME !
1,Pieces of junk. Definitely not oem, but also not even close to oem quality.		One never charged "fast charge" with my OEM Note 5 accelerated charger at all.  In fact, it charged slower than a basic charger.  The other worked great for about a month, then started cutting out and finally just died after not even two months.  The other gave up soon after.		Admittedly, I'm not super careful with my charger's cords--but then again you shouldn't HAVE to be.  I never let them get damaged, but if my battery is low I use my device while it's charging and, since the charging port is located on the bottom of the Note 5, the cord invariably ends up bending if you use the device while sitting up and resting it on your lap or knee.  This has been my habit for years, though, and most cords can handle it without soon splitting the wires at the base of the micro-usb port (the part that plugs into the phone, if you aren't tech-savvy). So when cords only last a few months, they are obviously substandard. The ones I received (via Prime, not purchased via third-party sales) are definitely lower quality.		A little tip though, for the less tech-inclined (and something I did with these cords but they were just too low-quality):  take some Sugru (my personal fave), or silicone self-adhering tape, or even thin strips of duct tape (but last resort bc it gets sticky after a bit) and wrap it around the first 3 to 4" of each end's port neck (to a thickness of about 1/8"-1/4") to prevent getting broken wires from  excessive bending.  It's a mod you won't see cord manufacturers making bc it helps your cord last much longer--and they don't sell as many cords that way, obviously.  These cords didn't last more than 3 1/2 months despite that mod, so I can't recommend them.
1,So far used it maybe 5xs. Has lots of echoing n feedback while talking. I have only use it around my house and once in my vehicle.
1,Poor wireless coverage. Installed it on a tow truck "short bed" Wrecker.  Wireless signal is not even strong enough to get out of the cab and to the back of the truck.
1,Great phone ruined by AT&T. This phone will not let me upload a new bootloader and custom ROM. It appears that updating the software requires some encryption key to get the stupid handset to update. There is a bunch of crap AT&T apps force loaded on the device that cannot be fully removed without root access and the locked bootloader/rom prevent this from happening meaning you are stuck with a bunch of ATT and MS applications that cannot be uninstalled. Also without root I can't see what crap AT&T might have hidden in here (carrierIQ I suspect).
1,DONT BUY. This phone case looked good right when I got it out of the package. But when I put it on my phone I realized that the rubber was to soft and it didn't fit my phone tight enough. The kickstand is extremely hard to pull out and every time I put it in my pocket the rubber like comes off the phone. There are no instructions to tell you how to put it on or how to use the kickstand or the clip you put on your belt.. I was going to instantly return it. But it said that it wasn't eligible to return.. I'am so mad right now.. But I would not recommend this case to those lg g stylo users.
1,When i got this product, it was new yes, how ever it wasn't really the sellers fault i accidently got the dry full body it stuck to everything so i didn't even get to use it, it was a waste of money.......
1,Didn't work, felt cheap
1,Not a quality item.  Fit is loose, case is pretty slippery.  I got this a big discount but it was a waste of money.
1,Start with receiving:		*  Package had clearly been opened previously and repacked as the outer clear plastic casing was beaten up, not badly but not new either. Charger unit had black marks on it which were not all easy to remove.		*  Another sign this had been opened and repacked, was the package contained no charging cable? The package clearly had a recess location in the package where one should've been.  The instructions also, mention charging using the cable, which in mine - was none existent.		Review:		*  Assembly of unit to the iPhone was quite simple, but the snap together sections do not align that well and you do not feel too positive with pulling it apart very hard, as the plastic is very cheap and brittle in feel and appearance.		*  The color white of the housing is a few shades off from the white of the iPhone, so it doesnt blend that well.		*  Housing is quite thick, so if you wan to plug in earphones once assembled, it would be more like threading a needle.		*  If you are looking at this to be a protective case in addition to a charger, then I am not convinced this hard plastic will protect your phone that well if its dropped.		*  The power ON switch is a very cheap chromed plastic made to look like its actual metal, but is very flimsy and I doubt the coating will be on for long if you use it long-term.		*  Due to its thickness, if you have thicker fingers then you will struggle pushing the buttons on the sides of your iPhone.		I am now just using mine as a back up charger for the phone but once its charged, I return my phone to its safer and more protective normal housing.		I accepted this product from the seller in lieu of an honest review.
1,The keyboard itself is great.  Keys are nice to type on.  Love the shortcut keys.  Backlight is great for typing in the dark.  But the major problem is that the cutout for the camera and flash causes the flash to create a haze in all photos you take with the flash on.  If that didn't happen then I would've kept it.  Sending it back to Amazon now.
1,The case is fine and heavy protection for your phone.  However, the belt clip is not.  The cell phone does not fit into the belt clip properly.  I have to force the phone off the clip.  I know longer use the clip.  The purpose of me buying this product was the heavy duty case and the belt clip.
1,Not a fan. After a while power button became hard to press
1,was not new returned...
1,Loved the color, but all 4 corners of this case cracked or broke chunks off within a matter of weeks. Weak design.
1,LATEST UPDATE:		Well, there is a design flaw in the clip that attaches the phone case to the belt.  There are two tiny plastic holes where the clip attaches to the back of the case.  Because of weak plastic, or whatever, these failed after 30 days of normal average wear.  The clip actually fell off of the back of the case rendering the whole deal useless.  I ordered a different case from another company (it looks almost exactly the same) but the phone slides much more easily in and out of the case (while still being very secure).  I guess you get what you pay for.  :(		The new one I ordered (which seems to be working fine so far) is an Aduro holster for the iPhone 5c with over 2,000 reviews.  Good luck.		-----------First review below---------------------------------------------		I've been using this for about a month now.		Pros:		Good quality.	Low profile.	Relatively non-slip case.	I wanted a holster for my 5C - and this fits the bill.		Cons:		So even after a month I am still trying to figure out the quickest and easiest way to get the phone out of the holster with just my right hand.  It is such a tight fit that it doesn't want to budge.  And it is hard to grip the phone in such a way that it releases out of the holster easily.  I assume that over the next year this will get easier.  But even today after having taken in in and out of the holster 100 times at least (and missing dozens of calls), it is still next to impossible to get it out with just one hand.  It is even a challenge with two hands -- so guess how hard it is with one hand.  When trying to force it out of the holster, you run the risk of it letting go all at once and the phone flying out of your grip and onto the ground.		Overall I know this will work for me - but I bet there are better options out there.  This is the 2nd holster I have tried so far and have not found the perfect match.  Though the price was right!
1,soft and no protection for your phone.  did  not mean to order it was added on when I order screen protectors for my phone.
1,All of the beads on the back fell off the case in the first week of having this item, I would not waste the money
1,Very tight fitting and the pink plastic coating is flaking off the back already.  Eh quality.
1,The case its self is good, I have always been using this brand for long time, however this  specific model (iPhone 6 PLUS) has a flow on the screen protector clear plastic and the holster, the screen cover/protector makes it really hard for the touch screen to function, you have to push it really hard, the holster belt clip can easily brake off, I still have my iPhone 4/4s, & 5 holsters, nothing went wrong with them, but this one broke off in less than 10 days and guess what, I forgot to return it till after 30 days, which makes is nothing but a garbage, am I buying another one? the answer is a BIG " NO " am I recommending  iPhone 6 PLUS owners to buy it? again B I G "NO" Ballistic needs to fix its flow and even recall everything they have sold so far! If the problem is fixed I will probably buy one! for now let me look for cheap Chinese brand to keep my $1000.00 iPhone safe.		UPDATE: I had to buy another one again...........Again another issue with this thing, the screen protector is NOT responsive, therefore I took my one star back. Ballistec: Please fix this problem we know you can do it.
1,What junk...I realize this isn't a miracle product but this screen did absolutely nothing. Product was cracked within 2 weeks from just being in my wife's purse, I didn't even drop it. Wow, they have a guarantee , great! Nope! That will be 6 dollars for a replacement after I spent 35 dollars on it at the Verizon store. Seems like a win win for the manufacturer given this cost them a dollar or so to make.
1,Fiddling with the clip in the car is definitely not ideal, it holds in place well, but damn I hate the clip.
1,Just like all the other reviewers say.  The edges do not stay, they should have cut the screen protector smaller so it would not go around the curved edges of the S7.  It is not much of a curve but it is enough that it does not stick!  I guess this will do until someone makes one that actually fits the S7.  I love Spigen products and have used their screen protectors for years on multiple phones but they messed this one up!
1,what a piece of crap, broke after two days of use.
1,Breaks quickly
1,This unit worked perfectly with the IPhone 5 until they upgraded the OS last year.  Then the unit would not charge the phone or charge itself.  I sent the information to Mophie late last year and was told that this one was counterfeit.  I contacted Amazon and they refunded my full purchase price.  They could not confirm whether or not this was indeed a fake unit.  I have decided since to get away from Apple products as I don't want to support their marketing tactics.
1,Having had a previously good experience with Case-Mate Tough Cases, I opted to try this one for the Note II. I was sorry I did.		The case itself is actually very thin for the protection it gives. The outer hard-shell, while a bit slippery, felt solid enough to be bumped around without getting marked or damaged. The inner lining is shaped almost as if it were a bumper, which is completed by a cushion-like backing inside the outer shell. With the case fully on, the phone did feel solid and well-protected.		The major flaw of this case is the material used for the inner lining. It's very rigid and hard to manipulate the buttons underneath. The volume buttons are a bit more forgiving, but the power button is a hard struggle every time.	Another drawback is the craftsmanship of the interlocking parts. The outer shell doesn't fit flush with the inner lining, especially on the top and bottom of the case (there are considerable gaps between where the two pieces interface). Regardless of how many times and how hard you try to push the parts together, the pieces simply do not adjoin flush. Add to the fact the high asking price, and you'll be glad to have looked elsewhere for a case.
1,Lasted about a year and then it broke. Would not buy again.
1,Updated: 8-28-16		I really enjoyed these at first. I bought one and after about a week I ordered another for the wife's vehicle. After a few weeks of use the sticky suction cup that seemed to really get a good hold started to fail and pop off the glass. This was even with freshly cleaned glass.		Then the holders that were included to control the power wire started to fall off and fail to stick. These too were applied to cleaned areas but have all started to fall off repeatedly.		Both of the ones I got worked with both my phone and the wife's but again after a few weeks mine will pick up the charge and then drop it a few moments later. It does this non stop no matter the orientation of the phone, the angle of the holder, and the placement of the wireless charging pad. I have a S5 and the wife has an S6. Hers is still charging fine.		The next issue Im having is the rubber that holds the phone in place on first charger I bought has started to come loose and stick out.		Then the one my wife has will not stay tight and continually falls forward dumping your phone out under regular driving conditions.		In the beginning I was very happy with these and thought they were going to be great. However, after some use they are starting to fail in many ways and are nothing but a hassle now. They need to be assembled with better components, especially for their price.		I would pass on this item.
1,GARBAGE!

Battery percentage drops from say 95% to 75% within 20-30 mins and once it dropped from 25% to 2% directly without showing the gradual progress down. Not sure if it's faulty hardware or not or something to do with the software bug. It wouldn't last me a day with this kind of battery issue.		- camera is ok if you want to take still pictures, autofocus is lacking with slightly moving object like person etc even with third party app.	- should you buy ? There is too many products in this price range and I would advise to go for proven reliability ...		Will update the review if I hear anything from posh mobile support.-		Update - 02.16.2014 - Heard back from Posh Mobile Support who said that the above two issues are unrelated and said are fixed with an OTA update which of course is not available when you check. Although I appreciate their willingness to help but they offered to remote in and remote wipe my phone with another factory image. And this is a red security flag for me, as any sane security concerned person would not allow another outsider to take remote control of your computer and let him into your home network.		When I refused to give in to this, they gladly offered RMA, terms and conditions of which are like below. So unless your phone is not working at all there is no point in going through this RMA process as you have to pay 2 way shipping with insurance. Whats the point in buying a cheaper phone if you end up spending so much in repairs any ways.		I would go with a reputable manufacturer for this very reason in future.		Here is the excerpt from RMA -		*If the phone arrives with physical damage, we will immediate return the device back to you, as physical damage is not covered under Posh Mobile limited Manufactures Warranty.		1.  Include a copy of the original receipt or proof of purchase along with your device (REQUIRED)	2.  Place the defective mobile phone (unit) and its battery only (do not include accessories), in a United States Post Office Prepaid Return (USPS) padded envelope or box	3.  Include a copy of this email with a print out of your RMA number, name address, email and telephone number	4.  Mail to the below address with the RMA # on the outside of the box as below	  Posh Mobile	  RMA# P20150216-833-1 (Please make sure your RMA # is written on the outside of the BOX)	  11 Vreeland Road	  Florham Park, NJ 07932	5.  Allow a total of up to 21 days for the arrival of your functioning device
1,Good product, fits charge port and works as advertised. The wire is pretty thick and heavier than the standard Apple wire.	Updated review: cord died after about 6 months...gets 2 stars now.
1,They stop working after a few months
1,did not protect my screen! dropped it from only 2 feet and my screen shattered :(
1,I received a different one compared to the picture. It didn't protect certain spots of the phone that are sensitive to scratches. I have two cases of amzer argyles for other phones. This is the first Amzer case I was not happy with.
1,Solar cell does not charge the battery and battery does not charge my iPhone.
1,The band likes to roll up and gets very uncomfortable. I also have bigger arms so it tends to squeeze my biceps .
1,I have the 6 Plus case and it's absolute rubbish.  Lasted less than 7 days before the tiny little tabs on the door broke off and rendered it nothing more than a expensive non-waterproof case.  Fit and finish was terrible, bottom of the case didn't stay snapped together.  I've had other lifeproof cases that were a great success, including the standard iphone 6 version, but the 6 plus version needs a lot of work.  Coupled with the fact that it only works with the expensive Apple OEM charging cables makes this a less than stellar option.
1,After changing this battery in my 2 year old S3, it still runs out of juice in less than a day with any usage at all. If left standby only, it can go beyond 24 hours. This is quite far off the mark compared to the original battery that came with the phone.
1,Left on my phone for a few days.  Happy it came with a screen protector because at least I felt like i got something out of it.  The bulk on this makes it too big to put in your pocket without looking like you have a library book in there.  Also, the kickstand was more of a hassle than other cases I have had.
1,Stopped working in less than 3 months, a lot of money for an inferior piece of crap
1,OK YES IT WORKS BUT IT ADDS CONSIDERABLE GURTH TO YOUR PHONE. IT IS NOT A  REPLACEMENT FOR THE ORIGINAL. YOR PHONE WILL NO LONGER FIT ANY CASE. WE ALL KNOW YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD CASE ON THIS BIG NICE PHONE. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS. GET ONE THAT GOES INSIDE THE STOCK CASE.
1,I've owned TechMatte screen protectors on pretty much every device I've owned over the last 2 years and have yet to be disappointed until this protector.	I got this as part of the free promo on xda-developers.  I've noticed some good and bad	PROs:	1) Does cover entire screen	2) No halo effect	3) Cutouts do fit correctly to FFC, sensor, earpiece and buttons	4) Comes with all the proper install materials	5) Fit fine with my case.	CONs:	1) Odd dot-matrix effect.  Not sure if this has something to do with the fact that the screen doesn't seem to "attach" like most tempered glass protectors.	2) Fingerprint resistance is not as good as typical TechMatte items I've bought.	3) Cover for the home button does seem to cause a bit of disturbance with EASE of fingerprint sensor use.  It still works, but it does seem to "miss" more	4) Biggest and most disappointingly: It interferes with the swipe down for notifications.  I find I have to use WAY more pressure to pull down the notification section.  Also am noticing an alarming number of "missed" letters when I am typing now.		It looks great and applies well, but I have to say that I wouldn't buy this in it's current state.
1,I really liked this phone for the first 5 months I had it, right up until I got the error message that it cannot connect to the camera.  Everything else works, I didn't drop it, I've never abused it, it just one day told me I could no longer take pictures.		I'm not a power user.  To me, it's mainly a phone with a camera, an e-book reader, and a convenient way to check the weather.  The phone has met all my needs up to now, but not any more.		I took it to a phone repair place.  They didn't want to get into it.  Even though my service is with T-Mobile (through WalMart's Family Mobile plan), The T-Mobile store wouldn't have anything to do with it.  It's still under warranty, but so far I haven't been able anyone who cares.  I still have one option left, but I am shopping for a new phone, and right now LG isn't too high on my list! <grumble, grumble>
1,Looks like i am wearing a hearing aid! Works fine nothing to write home about if you like music its not that great! I ordered the lastest Plantronics
1,NOT ALL THAT
1,I never got the right cords.  I got lighting cables and those quit working after a months use.
1,The case itself looks and feels amazing! There is one flaw I noticed though. If you have your phone off and you're holding it upright, open the flap and bend the phone side (right side) so the back left side touches the magnetic strip (as if you were using the kick stand/pop up feature), it opens/unlocks the phone without you using the fingerprint scanner. This is a security issue!		Also, if you are using the kick stand/pop up feature while streaming music, surfing the internet, or watching a video, if the magnetic strip touches a certain part of the back of the phone, the phone's screen shuts off/goes blank.		Love the case but the stand up/pop up feature is useless and frustrating!
1,Worked fine for about 2 months. Now it barely charges anything I plug into it
1,This is alright. It works good, however we cant use it with almost all of our devices. The plastic on the end that plugs into the device is so wide that it won't fit with almost all our devices that have a case. Only one device with a case has a wide enough opening that this can fit into. We are not interested in taking the case off our devices every time we want to charge them so this is only useful on two of our devices. It works great and the cable itself is definitely thicker and more durable than the original cable but the end that plugs into the device is a deal breaker. I love amazon basics products but this one needs some work.
1,Decent case, but very little protection for screen. I mainly bought it for the holster and use a different case.
1,It was good at first but it broke after hardly any use.  I probably could have called and gotten a replacement but I went with a cd slot holder since I don't like the suction cup on the window
1,not a big fan of this product, not functional at all
1,Useful on occasion, but not very durable & very shabby-looking.
1,Stopped charging up after a couple of months
1,I purchased this item and what I received was a Luxmo bag with a different product inside. This product is not leather, and the last time I bought one like it pealed off from the inside and damaged my screen protector. Make sure you get the one that has the Luxmo seal on the inside, that would be the original!
1,nothing special. only buy for the look if you are a big fan
1,I bought one of these direct from Mime website. Delivery was quick. Item looks good. Problem is it is a little long so it overhangs on one side. It is supposed to sit on top of the bevelled part of the home button so it has a smooth transition from the home button to the sticker but since this product is longer than it should be, it overhangs a bit on one side and catches on anything it come into contact with.
1,I bought two of these. The first lasted a month before the clip came away from the holster, the second lasted two days before the clip itself fell apart. Lousy quality.
1,Horrible cable very loose and cheap material
1,Very said magnetic case doesn't fit note 4 as advertised it's just to small the folio is beautiful I gave it to daughter she didn't want to tell me it didn't fit so I got her another cheaper 1. So it sits here for me to look at sad I'd love to use it. Just the mag case is too small
