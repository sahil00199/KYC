0,This is a small album, but every single song is great. Shine is a beautiful song, and Water's Edge is sung so beautifully. Those are my two favorites on the album, but every song is worth listening to over and over again!
0,I got this album a few years back and it is very funny. She starts off with a fictitious biogragraphy of Alexander Grahem Bell then goes into her calls as operator Ernestine. I like the punchline when she calls Joan Crawford when she calls her at the Pepsi Cola Co. to get her  dime back. I also like the jokes in  The Repairman and The Marriage Counselor and Mrs Mitchell among  others. Classic calls on the album that she made besides Joan Crawford are The F.B.I. which has a punchline thats just as funny and the standout track on the album which is when she calls Mr Veedle and tells him that he owes them money. Thats another one with a very funny punchline. The whole album is funny and you should get it.
0,I went from not knowing who Ryan Adams was to singing his praises in just a few weeks. After his appearence on SNL I was interesting, downloaded some songs-loved them, and bought this CD, "Gold." I was not dissappointed in fact I was totally surprised with how much I liked the album. It didn't leave my CD player for at least a week. Ryan Adams is an amazing talent, he combines rock with blues with country and it works like magic. He's song writing ability is amazing, all of the songs have so much heart in them and show true talent.	Highlights from the album include:	"New York, New York"- perfect timing for this song pushed it's success I'm sure, but it's worthy of it. The fast paced vocals and pure charm of the song has made it one of my favorites.	"La Cienega Just Smiled"- it's soft and slow and soothing, truly a beautiful song	"The Rescue Blues"- this song is just fun and you can easy relate to it.	"Gonna Make You Love Me"- this is another fun, sexy, love song with great pace and words.	"Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues"- this song is both funny and sad, it's got upbeat music with fun often painful words.	I recommend this CD to anyone with a wide range of taste in music. It's great! And I can't wait to see where Ryan Adams goes after "Gold."
0,This is one great CD. I have had it in my CD rotation since getting it about 6 months ago. I like this CD because they don't try to reinvent the wheel here, just some very solid songs with meaningful, lyrics. I hope we will see more from Kutless soon.
0,brand new great price
0,Really awesome CD
0,I really enjoy the songs on this cast recording of South Pacific.  This is an excellent musical about romance and racial differences.  I think Loretta Ables Sayre is so good as Bloody Mary.  She shines on tracks like "Happy Talk" and "Bali Ha'i". Kelli O' Hara is equally good in her role as Nellie Forbush.  She stands out on the tracks "I'm Going Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair" and "Cockeyed Optimist".  Paulo Szot has such a big powerful voice.  He sounds so romantic singing the song "Some Enchanted Evening".  "There Is Nothing Like A Dame" is a fun song.  Matthew Morrison has a beautiful voice.  I really like the way he sings "Younger Than Springtime".  I hope South Pacific wins all the awards it is nominated for.  It is a great show with classic tunes.
0,Great classic blues album, got this when it came out on vinyl, perhaps in 1970?  Very simple but very tight arrangements.  Willie Dixon is the most important blues song writer of all time with the possible exception of Robert Johnson.  He wrote most of the blues songs of the 1950s and 1960s.  Led Zepplin stole his songs and they eventually had to pay him a big sum, think over $1,000,000, for stealing his music.  He is not a fancy showy performer, but the music and vocals are good.
0,as promised
0,Kelly  Clarkson is truly a great talent, she is very real and a truly down to earth kinda girl and her CD reflects that. Piece  by Piece is a great song along with all of the others. She sings from the heart. I would recommend this CD to others, love it!
0,use go team as used in NFL ads for pregames at basketball games.  haven't had time to listen to the whole thing.
0,This is classic.
0,It's my belief that yes AC/DC has released some albums that were not as epic as others but they have not yet released a single bad album.  AC/DC Ballbreaker is in your face, heavy AC/DC at their best.  Great album, and it only gets even better from here.
0,HE LIVE CONCERTS AND SOME OF HER MOST INTIMATE MOMENTS WITH HER FANS.  OKAY NOT EXCELLENT
0,I really dig the vibe of artists like Gin Wigmore, Duffy (1st album), Amy Winehouse, etc.  They are just such a nice break from the cookie-cutter sound of most modern pop and rock music.		"Black Sheep" is such a strong kickoff for the rest of the album.  "Man Like That" has that nice throwback high-energy, jazzy vibe.  I don't dance, but "Man Like That" makes me want to.		Slower songs have a tendency to make me a little sleepy and sappy songs usually really turn me off.  However, Gin does such a great job with "If Only", "Saturday Smile" and "Singin' My Soul" that I actually enjoy those tunes very much.  "Saturday Smile" reminds me of Adele and Corinne Bailey Rae.		The horns and semi-country vibe of "Sweet Hell" make for an interesting departure from the vibe of most of the rest of the album.  I like it when an artist mixes things up like that.  It is unexpected and fresh and she pulls it off well.		In all, great album and worth every penny spent on it.
0,Great album by a great group
0,I like this little Canadian band :-) Had to fill my collection.
0,Iconic CD for the true GNR fans!
0,Omar is not a new artist but, he is a NEW artist to me....It seems this UK soul singer has been doing his thing for quite sometime. I found him on a music blog and instantly liked what I heard. To me his LP is on my best of 2013 list...
0,Several of Legacy's two-disc Essential releases have been upgraded with a third-disc and plastic-free eco-friendly packaging. Such is the case for the original 35-track 2003 issue of this set, augmented here with eight additional tunes on a third disc. Although the third disc clocks in at only 32 minutes, it adds an additional track from each of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dance-to-the-Music/dp/B000GG4XIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dance to the Music</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Life/dp/B000GG4XJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Life</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stand/dp/B000MZHVM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stand!</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/There-s-a-Riot-Goin-On/dp/B0013384JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">There's a Riot Goin' On</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fresh/dp/B000MTFG1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fresh</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Small-Talk/dp/B000MZHVMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Small Talk</a>. Nearly fourteen minutes of the bonus disc is taken up by the funk instrumental "Sex Machine," but more impressive is the group's tour de force cover of "Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)." The set's booklet is a straight reproduction from the original release; the third-disc's extra songs are credited on an inside panel of the quad-fold digipack.		The bulk of the collection as originally issued surveys tracks from the group's 1967 debut LP&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/A-Whole-New-Thing/dp/B000GG4XII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">A Whole New Thing</a>&nbsp;through Sly Stone's 1975 solo album&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/High-on-You/dp/B0000259M8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">High on You</a>.

The selections weigh more heavily to the group's peak mid-period albums, with the group's last first-run album Small Talk represented by only two cuts, and Stone's solo album only one. For most fans this will be a welcome balance, leaving room for a trio of group-defining hit singles ("Hot Fun in the Summertime," "Everybody is a Star" and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)") that turned up on the 1969&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Greatest-Hits/dp/B000GG4XI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Greatest Hits</a>&nbsp;album. What's missing, and what might have made the bonus disc more attractive to collectors, is material not readily available elsewhere on CD.		The forty-three selections provide a representative sampling of tracks from the group's seven Epic albums (eight if you include Greatest Hits), creating both a one-stop shop for those who want to get to the core of the band's legendary blend of soul, funk, jazz, rock and psychedelia, and a roadmap for those who want to explore the original releases. The 12-panel foldout booklet provides cursory discographical and chart details, a personnel listing, a few photos and disappointingly generic liner notes. [2008 hyperbolium dot com]
0,How can you possibly go wrong with a compilation of great songs from the great Elton?  It's hard, but I have to say that the exclusion of any tune from the classic "Tumbleweed Connection" album and the inexcusable absence of the exquisite "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" keeps this from being a fantastic collection.  I certainly didn't need the bubble-gum Crocodile Rock or the forgettable Island Girl in their stead.  There should someday be a cd of Elton's greatest album cuts that would include such gems as "Ticking" "Madman across the water" "Take me to the Pilot" "Burn down the mission" and "There goes a well known gun" just to name a few...  Ah, well, that's why I'm not a record executive!
0,Another Knockout album from a group that has been around for a while!! Well written and musically sound and artwork on the front is awesome
0,The album that got bob back in his game during the 70s. The band was one bob dylans best backup bands ever.
0,When I looked at spin magazine's list of 50 greatest bands of all time, it said that Pearl Jam's classic album is Vitalogy. I would like to say that Vitalogy is one of the [worst] albums I've heard in a long time. Ten is like 15 times better than Vitalogy. Spin magazine don't know what ... their talking about. This is one of the best albums of the 90's. It's full of lively songs with great guitar solos and vocals. Vitalogy contains [bad] guitar riffs, no solos bad vocals and lyrics, oh what the [heck], the album [stinks] major time.	Ten is just phenomanal. It really showed how talented these dudes really are. It's just too bad they wasted all of it on [bad] albums like Vitalogy and Yield. So if you love grunge and you don't have this outstanding album, you need someone to give you a swift kick in the [butt].
0,I bought it for one song. If you like Enya, you'll like this.
0,It's a big statement I know, but Talk Talk's last three albums are landmarks in modern music. From their new romantic beginnings ( and they were very good at it ) this album see's a band charting their own course with no room for passengers.		  Certain songs on " It's My Life " from 1984 pointed towards a change in direct ( especially with the track " Renee " ), but it wasn't until the 1986 album " The Colour of Spring " that we really saw the band spreading it's wings. Following with " Spirit of Eden " ( close to the greatest album of the 80's ), the band were really in full voice. The final album " Laughing Stock " leaves where Spirit left off, but the great thing about all three albums, is that there is still a faint thread of a pop song in them all. These albums need and deserve repeated listenings, as there is so much depth and colour to the music. There are few bands in the 80's that pushed the envelope as hard as this !		  Mark Hollis sounds like a wounded man, Lee Harris's drumming is hypnotic and Paul Webb's melodic textural bass playing was exactly that......a web that spins and spirals around you. Webb had departed after Spirit of Eden, and was admirally replaced by the amazing Danny Thompson. I implore you to discover this album, and go back to the previous two....you won't be disappointed !
0,I don't understand what the griping is about.  These days I would be happy to come across a quintet with one-fifth the firepower of these guys.  To listen to them just play live in the studio and knock the tunes out is simply mind-blowing.  It's a clear case of talent over technology.  Modern musicians have so many tools to clean up and edit after the fact - they can even make recordings without ever meeting - just slap the tracks together.  But it seems a vital energy and sense of the moment is lost in this manner, which really is a shame.  Stan Getz is the big surprise here.  After listening to all that bossa nova stuff - Who knew?  Even if you have only a passing interest in jazz - this is a great disc to own.  It really is the pulse of what was happening at that moment in time, and not just For Musicians Only.
0,Great album!
0,When you list the best Hard rock bands of the classic era, I mean	the top bands, you have a handful of groups that stand out. The bands that you have to love to be a classic metalhead. Zeppelin,Aerosmith,Sabbath,AC/DC,the Who,Purple,Van Halen,KISS,Cooper,the Stones. But the one "Hair band" that truely deserves a spot in this elite group is Motley Crue. I love all the hair bands and some of them are great, but Motley was the best of the 80's. They were not that great at songwriting,but then AC/DC aren't either. They were not as great a group of musicians as Van Halen, but The Stones couldn't play their way out of a wet paper bag. But greatness is measured in Legend, and Motley Crue have been the subject of some of rock's most infamous legends. This is their best album. It's not as rough as Shout at the devil, but it showed a band that had developed into a tight unit. They took their influence from Aerosmith, and Van Halen, and it shows here. This is a must for classic metal fans. This was what metal was like before Thrash and all that garbage took over. Buy it. You won't regret it.
0,My favorite album by kid rock
0,I had never been familiar with Yes, other than modern radio hits, before I heard this album.  This take the word "progressive" to new extents!  Every song goes in a million directions, with strange guitar lines, airy keyboards, and rapid time changes.  Being that I'm a bassist, Chris Squire's bass playing is my favorite aspect of this album.  His tone is super loud, clean, and sounds like serpents wrapping themselves around the other instruments.  You can listen to this album straight through without ever ruining your attention span.
0,At first I didn't connect with  the Dave Brubeck Quartet.  But experiencing them for the first time in person gave me the enthusiasm to follow the career of the finest jazz ensemble, I believe, ever meshed together.  Now, place the Dave Brubeck Quartet (in its zenith during the 50s and 60s) in Carnegie Hall, NYC, mix with spontaneous "rides" by the consummate musicians, and the results -- one of the best examples of great American "classical" music available. Recently I bought the CD, after having two or three LP copies, and I must say I felt so elated and energized with the Quartet's		live" concert. As Dr. Seuss wrote "If I Ran the Zoo", I would make this required listening for every budding jazz student in every music class in the country.  This is how it's supposed to be done. It's a splendid disc for long  auto travels because it is so well recorded and delightfully interesting. You'd arrive at your destination refreshed and enchanted!		It was such a joy to hear this set (2 CDs) again.  I have a whole lot of Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond CDs. And I do know why!		BUY IT NOW!!
0,The magic of John Mayer's music lies in the way how simple and easy to understand it is to an average listener, while keeping excellent quality that should satisfy even the most morose and sharp critics. It is no exaggeration to name "Continuum" not only one of the best albums of the decade, but also to demand ensuring it a place on TOP 100 lists of all time and adding John Mayer to Hall of Fame. I give such praise very rarely, here are my reasons:		1) songwriting is extra strong	2) every man can identify with lyrics, John Mayer is not playing too intellectual or sophisticated, yet the words are by no means trite	3) and maybe the most powerful side of the album are its instrumental performances and arrangements.		Mayer, an excellent guitar player (who else could cover Jimi Hendrix's "Bold As Love" profusely and not make it sound out-of-place on a breezy pop-blues album like this?) surrounded himself with a group of equally excellent musicians (e.g. Pino Palladino), giving each song its very own feel, making them uniformly beautiful, different from each other and at the same time wonderfully accessible.		Lyrical side is strong, too - while John's unassuming modesty encourages every listener to confide in him with his broken heart or joy in return, Mayer touches also on the worldwide events ("Waiting On A World To Change"), even doing it in an irresistible musical way (witness "Belief", one of the best-arranged tune of recent years). And when you think that the next song just cannot be so great as the previous one, comes the ballad  "Dreaming With A Broken Heart" or a closer "I'm Gonna Find Another You", where a simple, light breakup tune is profoundly helped by a bluesy structure.		Thanks, John. This album should stay immortal.
0,The last of the world symphonia troika of CDs.  Artistry on a rare scale.
0,An extremely rare, sought-after classic, this surpasses Dionne Warwick's first for Arista Records, which was produced by Barry Manilow. "No One In The World", done later by Anita Baker for her album "Rapture" (Elektra) launches the album off perfectly (Russell Thompkins Jr., formerly of The Stylistics also recorded this song for his CD "A Matter Of Style). "Without Your Love" is not something all or any of us should ever be without. "Run To Me", penned by the Bee Gees (Maurice Gibb would die from cancer. Robin Gibb would lose his life several years later) is a duet with Barry Manilow, longtime friend and colleague. "Finder Of Lost Loves", theme from the TV show of the same title which starred Tony Franciosa (TV's Matt Helm) and Deborah Adair, which lasted, sadly, only one season, is a tremendous duet with Glenn Jones ( and the most outstanding track on this album). No wonder this one is rare!	Warwick sings of regret saying "Love Doesn't Live Here Anymore". With Grammy winner and Motown superstar Stevie Wonder is " It's You", penned by him. "It's Love", you already know. "Bedroom Eyes" and "Weakness" (again, with Stevie Wonder) are self explanatory for your dim all the lights moments. "You Made Me Want To Love Again" is a victory song for those of us who lose faith in love, unless it comes again. With Dionn&egrave; Warwick, it should not be a problem. (Arista/BMG)
0,Landmark album by the Canadian sibling trio. A must have! Show me a rock journalist that doesn't have this CD in their top 100 albums of all time and slap him or her!
0,Deadlock is a very unique band within the Melodic Death Metal music scene.  With top notch albums such as "Wolves" and "Earth. Revolt" already on their resume, Deadlock needed to come out swinging yet again in order to continue progressing their style they have developed over the years.  Well, "Manifesto" may just be good enough to do that.		The album may not be as "heavy" as previous albums, replacing more of the traditional death growls associated with Melodeath, with more contemporary sung lyrics.  The vocals are excellent though.  Between Johannes' great sounding growls, and Sabine's sometimes angelic sounding voice, the album hits all notes perfectly, leaving the listener stunned and trapped in the non-stop onslaught the album brings to your ears.  The mixture of the two vocalists sounds quite excellent, blending heavy elements with more relaxed, and easier to listen to ones.		The band stays true to their typical lyrical content, animal rights.  All of the songs feature lyrics about how bad animals are treated, and about how humans need to change their "wicked ways".  I, personally, do not like being preached to, but lyrical content aside, Deadlock's style alone makes me continue to come back to them, over and over again.  Every song contains a nice melody, great guitar riffs, and excellent drumming rhythms that all fall perfectly into place when mixed with the growls and clean vocals.		Songs such as "Martyr to Science" and "Fire at Will" continue to develop a more unique sound for the band.  The songs contain catchy choruses, harsh vocals, and excellent instrument work.  "Fire at Will" even contains a unique saxophone solo, yes, a saxophone solo, and it fits beautifully.  The closing song of the album, "Temple of Love" is an excellent cover of the original title performed by The Sisters of Mercy, and Sabine's voice sounds perfect for the song.  "Dying Breed" is my personal favorite track, and it contains the guest vocalist Christian Alvestam from Scar Symmetry, Miseration, Solution. 45, The Few Against Many, and many other Melodic Death Metal bands.  Christian Alvestam has always had an amazing range to his voice, especially when it comes to clean vocals, and having him assist Sabine's voice in harmony sounds almost heavenly.  The two sound amazing individually, and putting them together on the same track was pure genius, seeing as the resulting sound is astonishing.		The song "Death Race", also strays away from typical stereotypes associated with a Melodic Death Metal band.  However, this time it's in a bad way.  The song, for reasons unexplained, suddenly breaks down into a random rap track in the midst of a good song.  The rap song does not stray away from Deadlock's lyrical content, featuring rappers talking about animal rights.  However, the content, the style, and delivery, all seem too out of place for a metal album, especially one of this caliber.  I can tolerate a band singing about animal rights, since it sounds more natural and the song is still enjoyable, but a rap song about the same subject matter just feels forced and awkward, resulting in a very unpleasant experience for the listener.		All in all, this album is very good.  If you're looking for heavy Melodic Death Metal, you probably won't be happy with this release.  The often pop sounding clean vocals may turn you off; I recommend you stick to bands like Dark Tranquillity, Mors Principium Est, Epicurean, Callenish Circle, Detonation, Zonaria, and other bands such as these.  However, if you're looking for something with more melody, something that is different, and something catchy on all levels, then perhaps Manifesto will be a good choice for you.  If you enjoy Melodic Death Metal bands such as Sonic Syndicate, Scar Symmetry, Miseration, Soilwork, In Flames, or Mercenary, then you will definitely enjoy this album.
0,Classic style! Some things never change, Thank Goodness. They've still got it!!! Smooth as butter and great songs, as usual. Really enjoyed this new CD.
0,"Sunrise" , "Home" and "postiviely 4th street" are my three favourite songs from this album. Positively 4th street being the best. Not being a big fan of Simply Red  I didn't know what to expect.		Sunrise was the single from this album and it features some really cool grooves and is one of the most catchiest summer songs I have heard in my life."Home" suits the mood Mick Hucknell tries to sing about in this album.		Positively 4th Street is an outstanding remake of the Bob Dylan hit. It features some really good vocals courtesy MH.		What I disliked about the album is the fact that it lacked confidence. I like Pop/Rock genre but Simply Red are much better than ending the album the way did with this one.		"you make me feel brand new" is a corny,unsingable song. However, if you liked this album , I recommend you George Michael's Patience and Simply Red - Greatest hits.		Both are great compilations of songs sung with more heartfelt lives that only music comprehends.
0,Now this is the type of Deitrick Haddon album I like. It has all the elements that I use to like from his older solo albums. It has some fun contemporary upbeat songs, nice ballads, and praise songs.		I like "Reppin' The Kingdom" because it's a fun song and has all my favorite artists on it, which are Canton Jones, J.Moss and Tye Tribbett. "Power" is another fun song to listen to when I'm driving, even though I can't stand up while driving :-) .		I even like the song "Touch Me". It has an old school style to it that makes me sing along with him and wanting to be touched and refilled with the Holy Ghost.		I also like the song "Mighty God", because it's a nice praise song to redirect your thoughts toward the greatness of God and praise His Holy Name.		So he definitely gets 5 stars from me. Great album Deitrick!
0,You might as well get your wallet ready. Even though you can get this album for a bit cheaper, you'll want this version anyway.	First off, about the album itself. If you don't own it already...WHY NOT??? "What's Going On" is up there with "Pet Sounds" and "Sgt. Pepper..." as one of the greatest recordings of all time. Marvin tackles the then ongoing Vietnam War, religion, the economy, the enviroment and other personal demons as he created a stunning inter-connected suite of intricately woven, heartfelt songs. Even though the recording is over 30 years old, it could have been released last week. The material is timely and timeless. The music is lushly and lovingly arranged, and stands as one of the greatest performances by the Funk Brothers, Motown's amazing in-house band. Marvin's voice is absolutely at its peak here as well. You hear every bit of his joy and his pain through that immaculate voice. Proof positive that Gaye was one of, if not the best singers to ever grace the planet.	But why this version as opposed to all of the other "remastered" versions that have been previously released? Many reasons. First off, the glorious remaster offered here is the best yet, offering even more clarity and impact sonically (this is the 4th version of this album that I have purchased, including vinyl).	Then there's the disc-and-a-half of bonus items offered.	The album is presented a second time in it's original "Detroit" mix, made prior to the actual release mix. There are some minor noticable differences in the songs themselves, but the mix is a little less lush and more immediate. The focus here is the brilliance of the Funk Brothers' original performance. It's about time they got the credit they so desperately deserve. The album ends with an instrumental mix of the title track, with instruments added bit by bit so that the depth of the arrangement is truly revealed. The hero here is bassist James Jamerson, who revolutionized the way the bass is played. Here, you understand why.	The second disc contains single mixes and a couple of outtakes, but more importantly it contains a live recording of Marvin and the Funk Brothers performing most of the album and a medley of earlier hits. The recording is raw, the performance was a bit sloppy (nerves and lack of rehersal time), but nonetheless is powerful and astonishing. I can't say much more than that without writing an entire book of praise. Just be prepared to pick your jaw up off of the floor.	The words "brilliant" and "masterpiece" are thrown around a lot, but here, it is certainly justified. The album stands as Marvin's and Motown's cultural highwater mark. To those who haven't yet heard it, treat yourself to a true gem. You NEED this album. To those who already love it, with this edition you'll find yourself loving it even more. I cannot recommend it enough. A timeless classic lovingly presented in all of its glory, and then some.
0,Oleta Adams' 1990 debut remains the finest example of her rich, rich alto voice matched with a bunch of mostly very strong songs and warm arrangements that surround but don't smother her beautiful singing. Production by Tears for Fears' Roland Orzabal is mellifluous while never bland and in the album's highlight, You've Got To Give Me Room, he pulls everything out except for Oleta's keyboards and a flugel horn. The space for her voice and the touching lyric is perfect. Oleta is often grouped with Anita Baker and Brenda Russell, but more often than not the timbre and fullness of her voice remind me of Gladys Knight. Unfortunately on some of her later albums, the material gets weaker and the production blander but on Circle Of One it all works wonderfully to create a very satisfying album that has not dated.
0,awesome album and story
0,As one who enjoys music with German and Scandanavian origins , this was and is a truly brilliant album. Sure 99 Red Balloons is good , if not overplayed . 99 Luftballons is even better . How sad it is that 99  Luftballons had to be desecreated by translating it into English , just so  it can break the American charts. Once the German version is heard ,  anything else will be just not enough !  In fact ,the song has quite a deep  underlying meaning, the German version that is . Note "Luft" in  the title , synonomous with Hitlers "Luftwaffe" . The rest of the  album though blew my socks off! It's powerful , rythemic and  melodious all  at once . "Leuchtturm" is by far the best of the lot . Where was  this album 10 years ago ?
0,this was the first who cd i bought i loved it and never looked back. this cd contains most of the who's biggest hit and is a good cd for the casual fan who only knows the who from their classic rock radio station.if your anything more than a casual fan i'd recommend the 2 disc ultimate collection which contains all twice as many songs as you have here. either way this is a good cd and a great intro into the world of the who
0,Led Zeppelin 1 is timeless. I have worn out several copies in numerous formats over the years. It's good to have a fresh copy in my listening line up once more.
0,Lisa Stansfield can sing just about anything! Ever since she came out with her first album,I've been hooked! Her foray into swing just shows what's she's capable of doing. I enjoyed the movie,too. Just wish it had been released on DVD. I watched it on VHS! If you love Lisa Stansfield then I think you'll pretty much enjoy this soundtrack. Her version of Mack the Knife is awesome!
0,By the time Tom Tom Club released their first album, Talking Heads had already established themselves as an amazing melting pot of musical styles ranging from the electronic influences of Brian Eno to the world-beat type rhythms that made Remain in Light the classic that it is.		Tom Tom Club clearly attempts to take the magic that spilled forth from Remain in Light and drive it in a similar direction while meshing it with the more current sounds of the time.  Witness Genius of Love, a landmark achievement that still stands today as one of the great songs of all time.  That song alone makes this album worth the price of admission.  Fortunately, the rest of the album isn't far behind.		I didn't care too much about Tom Tom Club in the '80s.  I'd heard Genius of Love and, of course, thought it was pretty cool.  I never bothered to pick up a Tom Tom Club album, though.  I found a copy of Close to the Bone on vinyl for $.99 a while back and thought it was good, but not necessarily great.  Nevertheless, I kept on the hunt for a nice vinyl copy of their first album.  I finally found it last week, for an amazing $4.  After just a couple of listens, I think I can easily say that this album is an order of magnitude better than Close to the Bone.		If you're a fan of Talking Heads, world beat, or even just somebody who knows Genius of Love and appreciates it for what it is, get this album.  In addition to the well known Genius of Love and Wordy Rappinghood, pay particular attention to L'Elephant, As Above So Below, and On On On On...  You will not be disappointed.  Join the club.
0,This is a great music delight. Jon Scnmidt is a piano genius.  He composes a song right in front of you Amazing. Enjoy all the music he does.
0,One of the most gifted vocalists of our time, Mary J. Blige offers up what is most definitely her strongest work to date with The Breakthrough. With absolutely NO FILLER whatsoever, this album is full of back-to-back strong up and down-temp R&B tracks, ballads and aching songs of love lost and heartache. Mary J's voice soars on tracks like No One Will Do, Take Me as I Am and Enough Cryin. Collaborations with Will.i. Am, Jay Z and U2 (!) add additional value and originality to this groundbreaking album. With first single, Be Without You, Mary J offers what is her strongest performance since the haunting No More Drama, and with songs like Ain't Really Love and Alone, this album is a very likely candidate for album of the year!
0,SELLING OVER 11 MILLIONS COPIES!, this album explains life at the best!, having this album as one of my first CD on my collection could have been a great influence in my style of life, the first track "Who Will Save Your Soul" say it all in the title track!, is a great tune a VH1 classic, and Jewel at her best, #11 on the Singles Chart!, "Pieces Of You" a great tune focusing in Racism and how it shouldn't exist, it's just wrong!, were all equal and have a piece of everyone inside of us, "Little Sister", speed beat, talks about a drugs and overcoming them, "Foolish Games" a total sad, melancolic, desperate love song! although is not the Radio Version were she strikes with that "tearing my heaaaaaart" shout, it's nice to hear the original attempt, and the lyrics don't change so the message is the same, "Near You Always" the b-side of "Who will save..." it's a great fast song about love and being always with the love one, pretty song, "Painters" wow! this is a story told in Jewel's voice one of the best tracks of the album, inspiring song!, so tearing apart! great lyrics, slow joint, "Morning Song" release as a single in Australia, this upbeat song states the beautiful feeling of staying in bed, with the love one, and enjoying life!, great song, "Adrian" in the style of "Painters" this song tells the tale of a boy that stays in a coma since a kid, a great poem-a-like-song, "I'm Sensitive" a little corny but ok, "You Were Meant For Me" state of the art!, great lyrics and music, of course you know the story of this, the title says it all, a lover that's gone, but should be back!, "Don't" slow track, "Daddy" getting even with dad lyrics, "Angel Standing By" this song reminds me of the 50's 60's, it was intended as a single but, it didn't work it out, why?, well it was a little to boring for Radio Airplay, Morning Song or Near You Always would have been better, I don't like this one although I take notice that's it's a nice track and great vocals. "Amen" the end of a guilty pleasure!.  This album should be consider one of the Music Masterpieces is great, and it reach to your heart and your brain!,  the new album "0304" has been consider a retractor of what Jewel has stated, but been a fan of Jewel since her beginning I think like the Beatles and Madonna, artist should evolutioned, so give "0304" a chance the lyrics are great and the beat is well produced, way to go Jewel you're a true artist and entertainer!
0,I thought it was really good, I felt that I identified with this music CD's more than with Steve Vai's.
0,I think this is one of those Albums that you need to listen to a few times to appreciate Young's perspective of the world.. I like it, will listen to it often :)
0,Badfinger was great, just too many demons in their heads! Great list of their work.
0,If you were disappointed by the piano rock on Fray's latest, you will instantly like this. Production values are stratospheric here, so listen loud with a good headset. "Transfer" is such an amazing song, it has a soaring Coldplay and Keane style wrapped into it, one of the best songs ever made in my opinion.
0,I love Johnny Mathis.  The album arrived with the plastic carrier broken, and instead of 7 cds, there are only 4, even though the carrier states there are 7. Is ad wrong, or is carrier incorrect?  Call me confused.  Product superb.  Thanks.
0,More and more of Robert Goulet.  This will give me hours of enjoyment for many years to come.  Glad I found this CD
0,I saw Ben Hur when it first came out. Of course to a child this was an unimaginable experience. I then saw it about 20 years later when it was re-released on much bigger screens. The effect was stupendous. Director William Wyler had indisputably set a new standard for scenes of vast sweep and power. But towering over it all is Rozsa's immense score. All of the accolades and awards this music has received over the decades. The reinterpretations and recordings by numerous orchestras, all speak to its uniqueness. Rozsa owned Roman Empire music. His earlier 'Quo Vadis' score contains several pieces at least as good and grand as Ben Hur and thus itself is a must have for fans of this kind of music. Be sure to buy ( you can only get it used now)the Royal Philharmonic 1990 Polygram recording conducted by Rozsa. It is THE best.		But it is in Ben Hur that Rozsa pulls together all of his previous experience in this genre to produce the ultimate soundtrack for what many call the ultimate motion picture. In the original booklet accompanying the movie (theatres used to hand out booklets to movie audiences back then much like they still do for opera audiences) Rozsa describes the looks of consternation on Italian faces as he strutted and pranced amongst the ruins of the Roman Forum working up ideas for his marches.  The result of course is the most varied film score ever written.  Lush when it needs to be. Intimate when it needs to be. And never surpassed pure over the top pomposity to match imperial Roman grandeur when it needs to be.		When most movie soundtracks these days are scored for interchangable helicopter chase scenes or geared to jerk the tears from audiences right on queue, it is important that we still have the music for Ben Hur which has never been out of print for 50 years. And it is a safe bet that long after most mediocre film scores are forgotten, you will find Ben Hur recorded on the next advance in music recording technology, and the next one after that.		Nec pluribus impar
0,While it is earfood listening to the beautifully strung "Pretty Baby" , I am not too fond of dark depressing tracks such as "Paint it Black" and "Prince."  Carlton's voice, however.. is suited for both gothic and inspirational.  She finds a compromise in the last song, Twilight.  This song, in and of itself, has some of the most beautiful lyrics i've ever heard... but the creepy tone of the song is rather depressing.  Carlton has a beautiful voice, no doubt about it.  And she is a prodigious piano player.  She must do wonderful in the adult contemporary category.  Although her second CD flopped, it is perhaps because there was much dissapointment in the other tracks on this album.. besides the buttered up singles which were released.  All in all, a very good album.

0,I was not prepared to like this CD. As I grow older I have less patience with music that strays far from my preference for indie rock and r&b-influenced songs. However, this collection is so charming and the lyrics and beats so constantly inventive, that it has won me over.		If you've been waiting for an album of songs to sink your teeth into from one of the Great American Pop troubadours, your wait is over. You may be tempted to dismiss this CD as sentimental because of it's lyrical content (What, another 'Christmas' song?), as well as it's low key, mellow performances. However, beneath the surface shimmer, you have some of the most resonant images in song Simon has ever produced, enough at times to send chills down your spine. Produced with a group of really talented musicians whose love for music informs the whole CD from beginning to end.		So paddle over to your Outbox, and get this, for sure. I guarantee after a few listens, you'll be hooked. My favorite tracks:	01. Getting Ready for Christmas Day	02. The Afterlife...oh, &$#*, the whole *$%& CD is great! :)
0,Must buy for Hoyt fans.
0,It's funny what people find when they clean out closets.  The people at Carngie Hall found a jewel and something unique and pure.  A great addition to any jazz aficionado's collection. In reality a must have if you like jazz at all.
0,From beginning to end, this is the most beautiful and most "real" recording of this work, the wonderful Stabat mater by Dvorak.		I first became interested in this Stabat Mater when I was preparing to sing the duet "Fac, ut portem Christi mortem" in this work. It's intended for soprano and tenor, but I was to sing it with another soprano. It actually worked wonderfully, and will remain in my memory as an astoundingly successful transposition.		As is my wont, I began listening to various recordings of the work, finding it in its entirety a truly great composition. Dvorak's ability to create a shimmer of sound while maintaining a wonderful sense of substance is part of what made him one of the world's great composers. I always feel I am hearing his emotions whenever I hear his music. His cello concerto, his operas, his songs, they all speak the same language - deep emotion, the ability to soar high and sink low, making of sorrow a thing of very real meaning, and of joy a very powerful substance.		I have listened to so many recordings by now of this work, but couldn't get hold of the Benackova one (this recording) until just recently. I wanted it because of my great admiration for Benackova, who is the perfect exponent of Dvorak's music. (If you have not heard her sing as Rusalka, it's a lack you must remedy!) Her voice is silvery yet steel, strong and supple, giving exactly that sense of sorrow and joy that is so evident in Dvorak's music. And the excellent Peter Dvorsky was in this recording of the Stabat Mater as well! I knew I had to have this CD set.		It's as good as I had hoped - and my hopes were almost impossibly high. This is hauntingly powerful and lovely music. I found myself deeply moved by the performance, and thanking God for such good singers, such an excellent orchestra and chorus, and Sawallisch's magnificent and sensitive conducting.		No matter who else records this work, you will not find a better recording than this one. It surpasses all expectations. It's magnificent, almost eerily beautiful. There are indeed some other good recordings around, and some that are not very good. But really, you don't need to look any further - this is the one to get.

0,Many years ago there was this 20-something who, disgusted with the self-indulgence of "Tales from Topographic Oceans" and bored silly by "Relayer" swore off new stuff by Yes and went about life.		Years later he decided to see what he'd missed now money wasn't so tight it squeaked and after deciding he was only partly right about TFTO and Relayer, he went on to try the solo albums the various group members had recorded when Yes went "on hiatus".		So: Fish out of Water is making an obvious reference to the track from Fragile, but the music on this disc is quite different from that on any Yes album up to that date this one was pressed. A bit of a mish-mash, but I like what I hear and sortakinda wish I'd caught this one "in the day".		There are a variety of musical styles here, from jazzy prog to boppy pop, and the vocals don't sound bad either, at least from where I'm sitting.		Four stars good. I'd have given another half if I could have held the disc and seen the insert.
0,Lorrie is my all time favorite female county artist...sh is superb...Saw her Live as she puts on a great show and loves to kid around.
0,Charo is very impressive - there is intense passion when she plays classical style guitar. I would love to see her perform with Esteban.	One of the top 10 performers.
0,On the Really Short List of Great Contemporary Christian CDs. . . . Another site review called this set "less accessible," and I could not disagree more.  Taff leaves everything on the table on this CD--no easy questions, no pat answers, no cliches, no fluff (like most of more current CC music).  It is just raw energy and emotion as he struggles with the day-to-day business of being a Christian.  He convinces himself (and us along with himself) by the end of the CD that Christ's "Life" in track 10 ("Breathe Life Into Me") and His "Healing Touch" in track 11 are worth the struggles present in tracks 1 ("Shake"), 2 ("Walk Between the Lines") & 4 ("Down in the Lowlands"), in particular.  The catharsis and/or turning point is track 6, "I Still Believe."  Taff wrestles mightily throughout this song, desparately hanging onto the convictions he holds deep down inside.  An absolutely gut-wrenching emotional and spiritual struggle is presented in this song--life at its very essence.  How can that possibly not be "acccessible". . . ?  Ignore that one "expert" and listen to the customers.  Follow Taff on his quest/journey--it isn't easy throughout, but it is well worth the trip.
0,I love Blackmore's Night and was thrilled to find winter carols.  Candice does an amazing job with the traditional songs as well as some unique one.  Very good buy!! Renaissance
0,When last seen, Smith, near mythic hero, had astounded once again with Heads Roll, a masterpiece of New Fall sound.  But of course, heads did roll, so after stunning the world with back to back masterpieces, we are once again met with a new band.  Call 'em the New New Fall.  Call 'em California goofballs, whatever, matters not, because they rock.  The sound on 'Reformation' (of the band) Post 'TLC' (presumably the pink slips delivered with a smile to the last lot), is monstrous, monotonous, bottom heavy, and mesmerizing.  Smith's voice sounds a bit stronger than on 'Heads', although he continues in his trend to more minimalist lyrics.  I imagine by the time he wraps the whole project up, he'll be writing songs with just one word.  Or syllable.  Something in his grunts and barks tells me he's moving toward a post-indo-european language, like Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, but w/o all the bleedin words.  A masterpeice.  Again.  MES is still god, and the New New Fall are still the mightiest rock n roll band in the world.
0,First and foremost, I bought this album at Target just last night after I heard about the horrific attack in Manchester (England) when Ariana had ended her concert.  My deepest sympathies go out to not only Ariana herself, but also the families of the 22 victims that lost their lives.  :(		Truth be told, I sort of dismissed Ariana Grande a few years ago when she burst onto the scene with 2013's "Yours Truly."  I was concerned that she sounded like a copycat of other artists like Katy Perry, Mariah Carey, or even Miley Cyrus.  But 3 albums in and 2 Christmas EP's, she has proved every critic wrong (and shut me up/put me in my place in the process).  She cares and LOVES her fans very much, and she isn't shy about saying so.		On this particular album, producer Max Martin (Britney Spears, Pink) gives Ariana the added muscle power that makes it all stand out.  She dabbles with a plethora of genres (pop, soul, R & B, dance, etc.) and deliciously wraps it all up with her sweet, innocent, not-so-subtle, ear-candy, luscious young voice.  Unlike the other female artists that I just mentioned above, Ariana is her OWN individual; she makes her OWN rules, doesn't conform to anyone, and doesn't even SOUND like anyone else!  Need proof??  Over a million tween fans can't be wrong.  And how about those guest stars like Nicki Minaj (she's a spitfire no matter where she goes), Lil' Wayne, Future, and Macy Gray (say WHAT?!)?		So if you are already a fan of Ariana Grande (or are simply curious about her records), then you should buy this album and support her cause.  (I'm actually hoping that her record sales go up -- WAY UP -- after the horrific experience that she just went through.)  Not to mention the other 2 albums and other non-album tracks that can be found on other websites.  Anyways, she's definitely converted ME into a "superfan", THAT's for sure!!!  :)		Key tracks:  "Moonlight", "Be Alright", "Side To Side", "Greedy", "Touch It", "Thinking About You."
0,Squarepusher has done it again!!  His best full-length lp, containing great live performances and his best, most sophisticated work yet!
0,Two Priest classics at one low price.  What more needs to be said.
0,Rolling Stone Magazine had a list called 'The 100 Greatest Guitarists Of All Time', and Jeff came in at #2 (just under Hendrix, big surprise).  Yes, he was voted above people like Clapton, Buddy Guy and B.B. King.	This is Jeff Beck's first album as an instrumental act.  No more Rod Stewarts, no more psychedelic hard rock, just a more mellow, emotional atmosphere of guitar playing.  The fact that it features the wonderful keyboards of Max Middleton only enhances it.	This album and WIRED are two of the greatest guitar masterpieces ever created, though it's impossible to say which one's better.  Included here are some driving funk tunes like "You Know What I Mean" and "Constipated Duck".  Then you have epics like "Air Blower" and "Scatterbrain", both of which feature some truly hypnotizing riffs.  The former, in particular, is quite enthralling, especially the part where it slows down and turns into a blues groove, complete with Jeff's exquisite leads.  But I think it's no secret that the best song on here is "Cause We've Ended As Lovers", chock full of painfully emotional guitar licks that will bring tears to your eyes in no time.  This may very well be the most heartfelt guitar playing ever put on record.  You can literally FEEL the pain and the sorrow that Beck exudes on his guitar.  I often turn out the lights, close my eyes and become lost in the glory of it, my mind in another realm, my soul deeply touched, and my eyes wet with tears.  And at the end, he seems to capture all of the pain and sadness in the world with ONE NOTE.  This is music for the heart and soul.	Of course, no song on the album can hope to beat that masterpiece, but the other songs are all wonderful in their own respect.  The instrumental version of The Beatles' "She's A Woman", for example, is absolutely blissful, with the gorgeous, crystalline tone of Beck's guitar making you feel like you're in Heaven.  And "Freeway Jam" is a marvelous rocker.  "Diamond Dust" and "Thelonius" are alright, but nothing special.	So I strongly suggest that you get this album, along with WIRED.  Both of them will make you realize what many already know: When it comes to emotional playing, there is nobody else like Jeff Beck.
0,I knew this album was in Spanish and I really enjoy relaxing to it.  I'd never heard of Luis Miguel before but I'm pleased I purchased it.

0,I heard the four tracks on this EP online when they were released individually a couple months ago, and now it's nice to have them on CD since they're good songs, and since I'm not into iPods.  Some of them, especially my favorite, Just a Bullet Away, probably could've replaced tracks that made it onto Death Magnetic.  Metallica might be aging, but they still have some fire left, as they showed when they played these songs live during their 30th Anniversary gigs in San Francisco.  Similar to the other songs from the Death Magnetic sessions, the four tracks here show off plenty of metal riffs and solos, with equal portions of Black Album-style heavy rock.  Here's a more detailed account of each track for anyone interested.		Hate Train--The first half of this song features riffs very similar to Fuel and Black Album-era verses, with the second half sounding more like their thrash era.  It has some slow parts with decent singing by James, but some of the first half might have sounded too close to Fuel to make Death Magnetic.  The solos could be longer, but this song is definitely heavy on riffs and has a lot of different sections.  Despite the Fuel riffs, I think it sounds less like the Re-Load era than several songs from DM.		Just a Bullet Away--Awesome metal song, with great riffs, lyrics, and vocals...this one definitely should've been on Death Magnetic.  It seems to be most people's favorite of the four, although Rebel of Babylon gets a lot of votes, too.  I think it would fit nicely on the Black Album, as it's sort of an almost-thrash song that would sound at home with the heaviest few tracks from that release.		Hell and Back--The strange song out of the four.  It reminds me of Broken, Beat, & Scarred in some parts, and Cyanide in others.  The weird verses in the first half don't remind me of anything from Metallica.  They're almost alternative, I guess; not bad, really, just different.  It gets fairly heavy in the middle, then continues with some nice riffs until the end.  Even though it might be the weakest of the four tracks, it's still good enough for a solid 4 out of 5.		Rebel of Babylon--This is another clearly heavy song like Just a Bullet Away, with some fast riffing in the verses.  James offers a few vocal lines that get about as old-school as he can manage these days.  There's still a lot more singing than in the old days, but you hear traces of that gruff, harsh James of the past.  It leaves a nice taste finishing things off heavy.		Listening to the songs on this EP, I could make the case that some are about equal to tracks on Death Magnetic, so I can see where Metallica might have had a tough time deciding which ones to leave off that album.  Just a Bullet Away is the only one that I'd gladly sacrifice a song for (maybe Cyanide), but just adding them to Death Magnetic would've made it too long in my opinion.  Which makes it cool that they put them together for an EP to hold us off until a new album comes together.  Clocking in at about a half hour with four 7-8 minute songs, Beyond Magnetic is a fine EP to add to Metallica's discography.  Easily worth the $5 price tag.
0,This is a lovely album by America's Crooner Bing Crosby - his last.  And it should have been available ob CD years ago.  But for some reason it isn't.  If it ever is, I shall be the firs to buy it.
0,I have seen The Who live. This is an excellent buy. Love it!!
0,We LOVE this album.  Hunter is totally talented, great voice, great songs.  I completely recommend it for country music fans.
0,Once more, Iced Earth proved that they were beyond comparison in the realm of Heavy Metal with "Something Wicked This Way Comes".  By 1998, when this album was released, Metal was on its way to becoming so revered again in the underground that it would soon be bubbling over into a very popular phenomenon.  The advantage Iced Earth had was that they had been doing this for the entire decade, not just when it was getting "big" again.  They were simply doing what they did best.  After the great "Burnt Offerings" and the phenomenal "Dark Saga" albums, "Something Wicked..." was yet another triumph in the lineage of a Metal band that was doing absolutely no wrong.	Ever maturing, evolving, and expanding, Iced Earth created another thirteen songs here that would rival the intensity of anything in their back catalog.  Lots of Thrash-heavy riffs, loads of dark and melodic interludes to add mystery and drama to the mix, and plenty of brutal, dark Metal to appease any fan of the genre.  Matthew Barlow, now definitely an undeniable fixture of the band, put just as much effort into the vocal delivery.  Even the drum position was filled by a returning member, if only as a guest musician.  This was finally the sound of a true band reaping the rewards of dedication and determination over the long haul.  Despite the increased number of European bands now playing this type of Metal, no one was even close to matching the brilliance and intensity of Iced Earth.  Fans definitely knew that this was the read deal, especially at this point.  In fact, the band never lost sight of who had gotten them to this point, hence the "Blessed Are You" tribute to the true fans who had gotten Iced Earth to this point.	One of the strong points on the album is definitely its lyrical outlook.  All Iced Earth albums contain decent lyrics, but it feels like this one was filled with more inspired topics and pinpoint lyrical accuracy.  Of course, that would lead to songs that infer more conviction.  With songs like "Stand Alone", "My Own Savior", and "Consequences", it's obvious that Schaffer and Barlow are really comfortable now with using their artistic powers to spread universal truths of belief in ones self, independence, and integrity.  With the vicious, brutal nature of the music behind "Disciples Of The Lie", it's only appropriate and ntural for the lyrics to be as biting and scathing as they are - a perfect match.  The album's most honest, introspective, and dramatic track is undoubtedly "Watching Over Me", Schaffer's tribute to a life-long friend of his who passed away - the same friend, in fact, that came up with the band's name and to whom the "Enter The Realm" demo was dedicated.	While this album is a non-concept affair, the title refers to the trilogy of tracks that end the disk.  The "Something Wicked..." triad marks an introduction to a full concept album that would eventually take place later in the band's career.  These songs encapsulate the prophecy, birth, and development of the character that will manifest itself in the eventual album.  The final song is the character's introduction - a dramatic entrance for what is to come.  The actual concept for this centers around a secret society that has been in existence for 12,000 years plotting the destruction of mankind.  Judging from various interviews, the actual plot and theme looks to be absolutely brilliant.  Amazingly, the three songs that introduce this plot and theme leave just enough to the imagination to make it unquestionably mysterious and engaging.	In retrospect, it's difficult to decide whether this album's notoriety was gained on its own right or for the full-length concept album it would eventually bring forth.  It may be true that the final three songs are the reason for this album's success (especially with the epic "The Coming Curse" finale).  But no matter what, this entire album is a fine chapter in the life of the only American Heavy Metal band throughout the 90's that mattered.
0,it is remine me of Frank SINATRA
0,Having been a long time spooky tooth fan, I was very happily surprised by this concert piece.  The band is playing at their tight\loose best. The set list is impressive, vocals powerful and spot on, and they actually sound better than the old days. Yes, there are missing key players, but this crew does it right. I would highly recommend it.
0,Bat Metallica album ever!  Every single song is great, not a stale one on here
0,Perfect
0,Just listen to senales luminosas and sulky and you'll know what I'm talking about..  This man is brilliant, to go from the highest grossing rock band in South America (Soda Stereo), to becoming an amazing solo artist that managed to weave electronica with rock to perfection, is a great accomplishment.  If you don't have this YOU MUST buy it.  Perfect for lounging around and relaxing, perfect to give to friends as gifts (even if Spanish is not their first language).
0,Of all the different versions of Holst's classic The Planets I've heard over the decades, Steinberg's simply passed me by for some reason. Having just heard it recently, it has instantly become one of my favorites. Steinberg's interpretation is relatively straight forward but compelling nonetheless. My favorites are those done by Boult in 1945 and Sargent in 1954.		But my main concern here is the overall audio quality. As has already been stated, the sound is basically bright and beautiful with great stereo separation. But the main issue here has been the lack of bass or midrange. So, being the audio perfectionist that I am, I think I solved that problem quite nicely.		What I have done is remastered each of the Planets through my computer using "Audacity." I'll get straight to the point. Because of the high volume of each selection, I reduced the volume of each movement by -2.5db. I then added the standard "bass boost" option (200hz frequency response and "bass boost" of 12db). It was necessary to reduce volume because adding the bass boost increases the volume and would otherwise result in over amplification. I believe the results are truly remarkable with just enough bass response to enhance each movement without any exaggeration or distortion whatsoever. The results are particularly impressive on the quieter passages of Saturn and Neptune but have given the entire opus the "bottom" it was missing before. I didn't think anything needed to be done with the Strauss selections. Though totally unrelated to the Planets they are a nice bonus to this package.		Anyone who loves The Planets should definitely check this one out. And I hope my suggestions are helpful!
0,I love his music. He is a singer, story teller and a strong man of God.
0,loved off the wall cd.
0,After seeing Ray Lamontagne on Austin City limits in 2004 I decided to chec him out. I loved "Trouble" and the song "Jolene". Then I got his latest when it came out in August. I just absolutely love the song, "Lesson Learned" it has such a lonely, longing feeling that I only get from artists like Jeff Buckley, Nick Drake, and the very few great songwriters. There are some slower songs that aren't anything great, but his mellow style is always listenable. I really enjoy "Can I Stay" and "Til the Sun Turns Black". With three very good songs, this album is worth picking up, even if half of it is a background music type of album.
0,The MCA "Greatest Hits" compilation is by far the best introduction to Holly, and if you only need one single-disc compilation, make it this one. Affordable, yet well compiled and certainly not skimpy (eighteen magnificent songs). The "From the Original Master Tapes" comp is great also, but is out of print. The music itself is flawless, every song on this album is a classic rock 'n' roll standard. Buddy Holly introduced the concept of balladeer to rock 'n' roll, showing that you could be romantic in addition to being fast. Even his faster songs such as "Rave On" and "I'm Lookin' For Someone to Love" have a certain sweetness that only Holly could inject into the raveups of this type. That doesn't mean his songs are restrained and weak however. Nothing could be further from the truth, as this is still great rock 'n' roll. The re-mastering is great also, as up to that time these songs hadn't sounded better. If you need only one Holly disc, make it this one.
0,Excellent job except the music is not in surround sound. I also have the PFC1 and I love it.  Please give us surround sound on subsequent issues to enhance the sound experience.
0,great album has lots of nice songs on it.
0,one of my all time favorite rap albums. the beats are effortlessly funky, jazzy, and hardcore. they have a warm, mesmerising style that perfectly suits phife and q tips dynamic rhymes. true classic.
0,The king of all things alternative in the 2000s has scored yet another major hit. Using the second half of the Raconteurs Consolers of the Lonely; especially "Carolina Drama" Jack White along with Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence, QOTSA guitarist Dean Fertita, and Kills vocalist Alison Mosshahart White, the drummer of the group, has created an album bluesier than anything he has ever done. Taking a backseat to Mosshart and allowing her to shine in a new light proves to be a brillant decision as her voices drips with the same kind of Appalachian forebodding found in spades in the music. Anyone who doubts the power of this blues album should check out "Will There Be Enough Water?" and to anyone who is a fan of balls-out modern blues I suggest you buy this album immediately you will not be disappointed.
0,Excellent product and seller. Highly recommended.
0,Ok, everyone seems to make a BIG DEAL of the cussing in "The Water", when they fail to realize, IT'S A COMPLETE JOKE!  And a really funny one at that!  How often do you see a band write a song where in the first half it goes off on an angst driven rampage, cursing at everyone, and then the second half of the song is an apology for the first half!  It's HILLARIOUS, and you shouldn't take it seriously, it was not meant to be taken seriously.  The Water is told from the point of view of a character, not Spock's Beard, and the whole point of this song is to show how pitiful and wimpy this character really is.  Lines like, "Please don't hate me", and "You, you, you! You all messed me up" (which might sound dark to the reader who hasn't actually heard this song before, but really, it's not) just go to show how light hearted and humor filled this band really is.  There's no shock value at all, anyone who thinks so is COMPLETELY missing the point.	Anyway, on with the review.  To say the least, this album is nothing short of INCREDIBLE.  Few bands come out with a debut album this powerful.  It really doesn't even classify as a debut album somehow, this band has their voice and style all figured out by the time they released this "debut"!  The production is very good (not as good as their latest two, "Day for Night", and "V", but still very good).  This is an album true to the progressive spirit, clocking in at almost an hour with only 4 tracks (including a bonus live track of part of "The Doorway" off their next album).  But looking beyond sheer track times (surely not the indicator for how good an album is), every song here is completely solid, memorable, and very well constructed.  The compositions are complex enough to keep you coming back and figuring them out, but have enough great melodies and hooks to get you going the first time you listen.  I've given this one hundreds of hours of play time, and it never gets old, in fact, it seems to get better with age.	I can't begin to describe the amount of variety you get on this album, while at the same time, maintaining a strong unity and cohesiveness.  In a way, it almost feels more like a well written concept album, only there is no story, or any actual connection between these 4 works, but they still flow together like they were completely meant to go together.  Just to show a few examples of the variety you get, there's Beatles-esque sections like the chorus to "The Light," the humorous and also beautiful flaminco section "Senor Valasco's Mystic Voodoo Love Dance".  There's the grooving interludes of "Go the Way you Go" which show SB to have some great jazz chops as well as progrock.  Of course, there's the above mentioned "F U / I'm Sorry", which I find completely hilarious, heck, I even played this one for my older aunt and even she got the joke!	There really is something for everyone in this album, unless your stuck up and concerned about being traditional and proper, then this album will just offend you.	Remember the bottom line, Spock's Beard is about having FUN while making great music.  They really have shown that you don't have to be dark, introspective, and philosophical to be good music, or even to be progrock.  Closest I can think of to early 70s stuff is early Genesis with stuff like "Supper's Ready" or "The battle of Epping Forest".  Spock's Beard really IS the voice of 90s progrock, and it's a great voice to have.	- Eric
0,What a fascinating lp! It is not easy at all to familiarize oneself with or even come to love the title tune. Of course it is a rock	spinoff of quite a few 20th century classical masters and needs to be respected as such. dissonance unresolved pervades close	to the edge...and then that meditative middle comes on chanted by jon and his voice reaches a crescendo as wakeman joins	with his classical organ...just hairaising, and we return to the largely dissonant modes voiced by the entire band and this long song	morphs back into its mystical fount.	to be honest, I really don't feel at all that Anderson had to be so incredibly elliptical with his lyrics throughout the album. say something, Jon, say something your audience can grasp and begin to think about.	And you and I has the gorgeousity of an ice crystal refusing to melt over quiet time. I fervently hope it never dies.	I must take issue with Siberian khatru. it just doesn't develop like close to the edge and it has none of the piercing beauty of and you and i.
0,This is one of the swingingest and most melodic modern jazz recordings in my library. This obscure session makes my top 25 top jazz recordings of all time.	Stanley Cowell's solos on this date are some of the most beautiful and melodic I have ever heard.	I have been listening to this date constantly for 30 years, and it is just as fresh to me now as it was when I first heard it.	]Highly recommended if you like mainstream, engaging and melodic music. This sessionwill hold your interest from beginning to end.
0,Wasn't sure what to expect with this CD, but I love it.  I would describe it as a combination of chanting, gypsy music, and Carmina Burmina.  It's lots of fun.  The musicianship is wonderful and the standard excellent Naxos sound. Also, Naxos provides excellent liner notes explaining what the Black Madonna is and the tradition behind the songs.		It's a CD I expect to listen to often.
0,Love this soulful music. Mr. Butler always elicits a spiritual (sensual) reaction. Dance and romance.
0,Be prepared to take flight when listening to this CD.  Many consider Sarah Brightman to have one of the best voices, and this CD proves that statement.  If one has never thought of the voice as an instrument, listen to Senvean.  You cannot help but be carried into the angelic realm.  Then, she sings a duet with Paul Stanley of Kiss - wow - did I mention rock opera.  Sarah sang in the Phantom and here she proves that she is the master for rock opera, if there is such a thing.  Flours Du Mal will make that statement true!  Canto Della Terra is the crowning achievement of the CD, very powerful and full of emotion.  The title track Symphony is probably the weakest song due to the lyrics, but my gosh, that wonderful voice.  Want to be lifted for a moment from this world - listen to Senvean and there you go.  If you are not moved by this song and Canto Della Terra then something is wrong with you.  Apologize for the strong statement, but this rocker says, opera can not only be good, but it can be great.  Your ear drums will thank you for the pure delight of this masterpiece.  MAD
0,So i got this album by chance from downloading a huge new jack swing packet. I thought to myself,who's johnny gill? I've heard of sweat,levert,gill, bobby brown, and new edition, but It always seemed to me that most people seemed to forget about his music. Johnny's gill's 1991 album is amazing. It's got slick beats and excellent vocals to back it up. Since michael jackson just died recently, alot of people proclaimed his dangerous album to be the greatest new jack swing album, i strongly disagree I think Johnny Gill's is just as excellent of an album. Fairweather friend is great, rub the right way is one of my favorite title tracks, and I also love my,my,my. It's great dance music, and the beats are interesting to listen to. If your into r&b this album is a must have!
0,It's all here, everything popular enough in 2015.  Don't know what you are in the mood to listen to at the moment.  Play this and you'll find what you need.
0,Most people don't seem to get this album. Sadly it draws immediate comparison to it's predecessor The Hounds Of Love, Kate's most critically acclaimed and well known album. While I will be the first to admit that Hounds is indeed a masterpiece, so is The Sensual World. Unlike most artists Kate changes the sound between each release, important for evolution and the reason we love her so much. Thankfully (from my perspective) The Sensual World wasn't Hounds Part II.		The Sensual World is unashamedly romantic and lush. Songs of love, lust and hate fill this disc; from the gorgeous, syrup-like open track The Sensual World (adapted from Molly Blooms narative at the end of Ulysses and inspiring 1990's singers such as Tori Amos and Bjork), through to the foresightful Deeper Understanding, the crazy Rockets Tail and the beautiful This Womans Work. My personal favourite is Heads We're Dancing, a chilling story of a woman (maybe Eva Braun, though the lyrics suggest she didn't of him - or perhaps it's written from the perspective of a whole nation?) who falls in love with Hitler. Great percussion, brilliant guitars and a good story!		The disc also seems to draw a response for lacking cohesiveness. I think it flows beautifully, the "sound" of each track is similar enough without becoming repetative, and the theme of the album runs strong through all the lyrics. Give the album some time to settle in, allow the songs to float in your thoughts, and I am sure it will soon become a favourite!
0,I like country music
0,I have most of Roger Whittaker's music on vinyl records now getting them on cd's. With all the technical changes in our lives is nice to have these become available.
0,cool
0,On the contrary, I think this is a sophisticated selection of songs that grabs onto the listener.  I only own this one and "Life" (which I also like very much; "Blue" is pretty awful).
0,Good CD soft spoken Jim Ed  good music
0,I have had the vinyl disc! Then I sold it, but I just realized it was the best "Satin Doll" I had heard for years. Nothing out on CD.  I waited and it never came out.  Then I took my worn-out vinyl to an engineer who could make it into a CD, and he did. But there were all the scratch marks and ruins of a lot of listening. Pretty bad.  I had it on CD, but it just sounded grungy! One time when I was casually flipping through the Duke Ellington list on AMAZON, I found it! I deceided that I needed that EXCELLENT album, so I ordered it.  It stays all the time in my car.  A wonderful recording of a dance collection with Duke Elligton at Le Bal Masque. , Yes, it is EXCELLENT!!
0,awesome
0,Third release on, Richard Ashcroft is back with a Motown feel added to his usual brand of northern indie rock. Besides that, nothing much has changed: The tunes are still as catchy as ever, and of course, the brilliant lyrics Ashcroft always has had a knack at writing remains.		Matching up to the genius of his year 2000 debut release Alone With Everybody and a few notches better than 2003's Human Conditions (which suffered quite a beating from both the critics and the audiences), Keys To The World will definitely open quite a few many more doors, if not the world, for the ex-frontman of The Verve.		"Break The Night With Colour", the first single off the album is one of the strongest, its lyrics dealing with what has always been the fundamental topics of his lyrics: lossless-ness and self-discovery - `The corridors of discontent / That I've been traveling / All alone in search for truth / The world's so frightening / Nothing's going right today / Cos nothing ever does'.		Some other stand-outs here are "Music Is Power" with its massive orchestral ensemble a la Starsailor's "Four To The Floor" and "Words Just Get In The Way" which is nothing short of breath-taking. "Why Do Lovers" and "Cry Till Morning", are without an inch of doubt some of the best ballads Ashcroft has written to date. They will again re-affirm why Richard Ashcroft has been repeatedly called a legend of our time, along with other heavy-weights like Noel Gallagher and Ian Brown.		Keys To The World ends with "World Keeps Turning", and when Ashcroft belts out `Everything in my life is right again', one can only hope he doesn't really mean it. Ashcroft's music has always been driven by the darker side of his life - sadness, confusion, difficulties - and it certainly would be a shame if this journey ends at the third album mark The Verve's journey ended at.		People can say whatever they want to say about Richard Ashcroft. All the stories about him being a `former indie glory whose star is slowly fizzling out' really can't be taken seriously because that's just exactly what they said about Noel Gallagher a couple of years back, and look at where Oasis is now. Measuring talent and heart, Ashcroft gives his listeners more than the legal amount in Keys To The World, only serving to counter all the empty talk of a burn-out.		So it's time to yet again step aside and make way for the man who always has had all the right keys to unlock the world - Ashcroft stands alone mightily, and he is a living proof that life does indeed continue, even after the revelatory work of a band like The Verve.
0,I can't imagine not liking anything this lady performs,she will always be a favourite of mine.
0,Another great Christian artist!! Bought it at a very low price! And it's the deluxe addition!
0,What a charming opera this is.  There are many beautiful melodies which, for Gounod, is not surprising.  Mirella Freni has exactly what Mireille needs, a spinto voice with agility and charm.  Only one minor blip at the beginning of the opera finds her hoarse on one note.  Should have been fixed.  This is a difficult role and friends of Gounod thought it was unsingable for a purely lyric voice of the first Mireille.		I love Vanzo and he does not disappoint here.  Beautiful legato, strong top notes and expressive singing.		Van Dam is his usual wonderful self, menacing and strong as the villain.  Great conducting to boot.		Enjoy!
0,This had the potential to be as great a live album as "Get Yer Ya-Yas Out," but the Stones sound tired and wasted.  The music is great, but Mick sounds like he's either drunk or tired on most of the songs, and the  choruses of "Honky Tonk Women" and "Tumbling Dice"  don't follow the rhythm of the original studio versions.  The tempo of some  songs are sped up a couple of measures, or slowed down to the point of  almost stopping.	Keith Richards' guitar playing is excellent (I had read  that his infant son, Tara, had died only a day or two before this album was  recorded.), and Ron Wood sounds like he fits right in.	"Love You  Live" is a good chronical of the Stones' live sets of the mid-70s,  when making great music wasn't as much a priority as ingesting certain  medicines.
0,A Very Under Rated Band and I think this Album getsthen  DEAF ??!!
0,Just what I wanted.
0,Josh has done it again, filling an album with songs he has written and songs he loves. Every song is a gem. But then, all of his work is this way, just perfect.
0,Love this album, rember listen it At Full Sail at the live sound part of theather corase . With Meyer Sound and a big Yamaha Bored.
0,What is there not to like?  Good movie and a good soundtrack.		Liner notes were ok but more is always better.
0,There are places in this recording of Jeff Beck playing his electric guitar that are almost "painfully" beautiful! Like a wonderful voice at its best! The only other similar experience I've heard with a "mastered" instrument that stood out so vividly for me was a Shirleigh Moog (wife of Robert Moog...) produced recording of Clara Rockmore playing her original-version of the Theremin. Recommended!
0,I don't write reviews normally, nor am I an expert on programming/engineering. I don't like vocals in my house. This isn't a typical Sasha CD. With all that being said, I honestly don't know how there are 1 star and 2 star reviews! I like this the best out of the 3 involver CD's. All this mix/remix/production did was make the wait to see his live set in a couple of weeks almost unbearable.... Sasha music should not have any expectation of what it should sound like attached to it. This is a masterpiece.
0,if you're a Blondie completist, you need to have both discs. Here are the tracks you'll find here that are not on the domestic "remixed" CD....		1. Union City Blue (Diddy's Power & Passion Edit)		4. Heart Of Glass (Diddy's Adorable Illusion Mix)		5. Sunday Girl (The Hardly Handbag Mix)		6. Call Me (Debbie Does Dallas)		9. Hanging On The Telephone (Nose Bleed Handbag Mix)		If you also own all the maxi CD singles released at the time, you'll have a few of these mixes already,  but this is a good place to get those mixes if you missed out on the CD singles.
0,This song is great ,voice and beat included, paris does a great job on her debut, so damn ,stop hatin.
0,Good tour, good recording. Must have for Rush fans. Personally i liked R40 tour a lot better, but i saw the CA tour 2x and this is a great representation and concert.
0,I still listen to this CD. Very nice! "Everything Must Change" is my favorite track on this album. Sure wish they would've went so much further.  Finally, a group that took pride in dressing up to entertain.  For real, Mista was the second coming of The Temptations.  I miss good music like this. For those who miss that 90's R&B, this is a great addition to your collection.
0,great new album , Ace has not lost his sound, that is straight rock n roll. Very original sound, You can find iy cheap, with fast deliver.
0,The bottom line is:	AC/DC's WORST ALBUM IS FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER HARD ROCK BANDS BEST ALBUM.....PERIOD...END OF STORY!		YOU WON'T BE TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ONE!!
0,Tomcattin' is the fourth full-length studio album by Southern Rock legends Blackfoot, it was released in 1980 and is one of the band's harder and heavier albums.		The band, who hail from Jacksonville Florida and are lead by Rickie Medlocke (Lynyrd Skynyrd) deliver a brand of Southern Rock flavoured music only focused with an almost Heavy Metal intensity.		For most fans, the band's pinnacle is always considered to be the three studio albums Strikes, Tomcattin' and Marauder, in addition to the incendiary live album, Highway Song Live. These albums represent the band's artistic and commercial best, before industry politics and shifting musical climates would change Blackfoot from a big deal set for stardom into a band that you discover when you get into other artists from the same genre.		While Strikes is more authentic to the genre's Skynyrd influence, and Marauder is more radio friendly and commercial, Tomcattin' is the heavy moment in between that maintains some of the Southern Feel, hints at the catchy and melodic future and lays down a furious metallic backbone all at the same time.		Tracks like `Fox Chase' and `Warped' are fast and aggressive, `Street Fighter' is a mid paced rock number and `Spendin Cabbage' is the one acoustic track on there.		So if you like the heavier moments from bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers and Molly Hatchet or would like to hear what a band like Judas Priest or Scorpions would've sounded like with a Southern edge then give Blackfoot a try, and if you want a direct and heavy Blackfoot album then pick up a copy of Tomcattin.
0,If you have enjoyed the last few release from ENSLAVED than you will love this album. This is what they do and they do it well.
0,I have been a fan of Rod Stewart since "Hot Legs" in the 1970's. I have always liked his raspy sound and undeniable talent. I have some albums from the 1970's, and I also have all of the cover albums that he has done in the last 5-6 years. I think this cover cd is his best. There are only a few songs on the cd that I do not care for (Love Hurts, Crazy Love, Everything I Own, If Not For You). On the song "If Not For You" it sounds as though Rod could barely reach the notes, like as though his voice was fatigued. That is okay though, because there are enough other tracks on the cd that are much better. I remember all of these songs from the original artists in the 1970's, and it is nice to hear the songs all grouped together on one disk, with Rod putting a new spin on the material. It would have been cool if Rod would have recorded the song "Smoke On The Water" from Deep Purple or the song "House Of The Rising Sun." I also think Rod could have covered any of the songs from Chicago "Will You Still Love Me," "Hard To Say I'm Sorry," "You're The Inspriration," "Hard Habit To Break" and/or any of STYX songs, "Babe," "Lady," "Grand Illusion" and it would have sounded awesome. Oh well, maybe next time.		I absolutely LOVE the songs "Fooled Around And Fell In Love,"  "Still The Same," "The Best Of My Love," and "I'll Stand By You." My number one favorite track on the disk is the Cat Stevens tune "Father and Son." Even though Cat Stevens wrote the tune, it could easily be the story of Rod's life. He has been on top of the world, been a rock star (don't we all dream of being a rock star!) and now he is an accomplished artist of "standards." Who would have thought it. There are so many rock stars who die prematurely (Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, John Lennon, etc) where the world is robbed of their talent forever. Rod Stewart has survived, and survived well. He is definitely a major star.		I think the producers did a good job of just letting Rod's voice sparkle. So often cd's have that "synthesized" sound, where it is obvious the no-talent person required computer enhancement. That is not the case here. Rod did a great job.		I have enjoyed Rod's concept albums of covers over the last 6 years, but I hope that his next disk has new material. That would be a nice change. Obviously Rod could always return to covers, but putting out some new soft rock songs would be really cool.		Well rock fans, overall I have really enjoyed this disk. I hope you do too.
0,Of course the "hits" are here ("Bernadette," "Same Old Song," "Just Walk Away, Renee,"  "Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch," and so many more).  However, this is necessary purchase for its inclusion of three songs from the group's last Motown album before "jumping ship" to ABC-Dunhill: "Still Waters (Love"), "That's the Way Nature Planned It," and the pop standard "It's All in the Game."  These three tunes should have received better promotion from Motown for they show the group's talent at its best.  Thankfully, this compilation allows longtime fans and new converts a chance to experience one of the era's premier vocal groups at their apex.
0,In Rock (1970.), Deep Purple's fourth studio album		Deep Purple's 1970 release saw the band find what they were to prove themselves to be a master of, classic hard rock. Deep Purple had undergone a lot of change in the previous 6 months/year before this album was recorded. The Mark I (original Deep Purple line-up) which produced 3, to many quite unknown (but not bad) albums was no more. Vocalist Rod Evans and bassist Nic Simper left the band in mid 1969 and the remaining members had to start from scratch. However, the Mark II line up was to rise out of the ashes of the previous line up with massive success over the 1969-1973 which they were together. New vocalist Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover along with the classic guitar playing of Ritchie Blackmore, whizz keyboard skills of Jon Lord and powerful drumming of Ian Paice were to be a winning formula. Their first effort, this one, was to be an excellent hard-rocking starting effort.		Deep Purple in Rock is by far one of the heaviest albums of its time with its thick but racy guitar lines, heavy bass and overlay keyboard complexion however this is what gives it great passion and drive and makes it one of the true original 'heavy metal' albums. People often say that Black Sabbath are the godfathers of heavy metal but in my opinion, Deep Purple come very close to their level. It is true to say that this album is not quite as refined as later Mark II works such as Machine Head and Fireball but you can see them approaching these later works with this album. The album itself has a great cover, depicting the band faces set 'In Rock' instead of the US Presidents carved into Mount Rushmore. It often amazes me how this album made very little impression in the US album charts, reaching only #143!!!!! Still it had good success in the UK, reaching #4.		This album contains some real heavy tracks with loads of drive. The 25th Anniversary Edition, remastered and put together in 1995 is excellent and is the version of this album to get (it comes with a cd case with imprints of the Mark II bands signatures). The album is greatly expanded on the Anniversary Edition and includes the 'A' side classic, Black Night (the remaster and an unedited remix is available on this CD) - this is a great track known to many - the remix of it is brilliant with an extended guitar solo from Blackmore which rocks hard. Some extra tracks, 'Jam Stew' and 'Cry Free' are included which are good worthy additions. A piano version and remix of 'Speed King' and a 'Flight of the Rat' remix are also available which further enhance the effects of Deep Purples work.		So these are the extras on the anniversary edition, what about the actual 7 tracks on the album? All of them are fab, even if they do occasionally have a slightly unrefined edge to them. Speed King is a crashing opener and a true Deep Purple classic - a whilrling guitar opening leads into a track which rather on the lines of a later masterpiece 'Highway Star' which features on Machine Head. Bloodsucker is a heavy follow up with a great aggressive riff - Gillans screaming at the end give the track a piercing but kind of haunting finish. 'Child in Time' is a 10+ minute Deep Purple epic which builds to an epic climax in the middle of the track then cleverly returns to the more thoughtful style shown in the opening part of the track. 'Flight of the Rat' for me is the best track on the album, 7 minutes of metal with some brilliant riffs and some nifty keyboard work from Lord. 'Into the Fire' and 'Living Wreck' follow this and both are heavy rockers, even if they are not stand out songs. 'Hard Loving Man' makes a blasting finale to the album which pounding lines of keyboard and guitar.		So, it measures up pretty good. I would never put 'In Rock' alongside Machine Head (which I think deserves 6 stars at the very least!) but still it is deserving of all the praise it gets and of a 5 star rating. What you witness here is, in my mind the true birth of Deep Purple, one of the great heavy rock bands that have graced this earth. It has certainly given me the incentive to buy more of Deep Purple's albums both studio and live.
0,I may be in the minority of the reviewers here, in that I have never seen the movie "Kundun". I picked up this cd because it looked interesting (I know...u can't judge a book, or cd in this case, by it's cover), but I am a great experimentor and I love 'discovering' different forms and types of music. And this looked intriguing and different. I thought it might be hard to get into, but not at all. From the opening track I was spellbound. I find the whole album to be very dark and mysterious...captivating, hypnotic and spellbinding. It is unlike any soundtrack that I own, and I love it. I've been playing it straight for the last 3 days, and the more I hear it the more I find to like. It's a wonderful cd to relax and meditate too. It is very soothing. Now I just have to see the movie too.  :)
0,finally the waite is over, this is 1 incredible collection of music & musicians brought together for the first of 5 shows at the manchester opera house in london.  featuring all the songs from demon days plus hong kong & latin simone. the whole concert has special all new visuals that play in the background to each song created by jamie hewlet(murdoc), which can be sceen in the regular portion of the show or a special feature that you can just watch the visuals with the music.  comes in stereo, dts & 5.1. for the best sound available.  also comes with a 9 page book with awesome pictures & band info with all new art inside.  the only thing that dissapointed me was mf doom couldn't make it but he had a special video of him performing along with dennis hopper & ibrahim ferrer but he just passed on so he has an excuse & their is no behind the sceens stuff, but for $14 you cant miss this awesome collection & amazing live performance.  i guess this is what were saposed to watch waiting for the 2007 world tour that is like forever from now, but at lease we have this , cheers

0,My cat actually sat and listened to this!!!
0,This one is as good as "solitarily speaking of theoretical confinement", another masterpiece of trascendental music, this is more than just heavy rock, you don't listen this amount of virtuosism and quality compositions very often. Jarzombek is a musical genious with enough sense of humor not to take himself very seriously, but his music. Kudos to his bandmates too. Highest recommendation.
0,This Japanese mini-lp replica version of Genesis And There There Were 3 is simply a work of art! Very beautifully designed with all the lyrics included and with a sound quality SACD remastered to perfection.	This is by far the best version of this album that is out there; great sound quality, great packaging, great extra material with videos, making off! A must have in any CD collector's library.
0,This album covers so many styles in such dramatic and exciting ways I don't think it has ever been topped for sheer innovation.		The production is fantastic, the musicianship is outstanding the humor and the emotion energizing, I think this is one of the all time Rock greats.		I was blown away in college in the late 60's by the record, it was so different from their earlier singles that I had imported from England. The Move had evolved from a great Rock n Roll band into a true progressive multi-directional Legend.		This CD is a must have for any true Rock fan.
0,GREAT CD
0,Sure, there are more artistic, and more complex albums. I have over 50 of the supposed "classic" albums of the 90's. Some are great, some not so great. Nevermind stands above them all though. 12 unforgettable songs, highlighted by the transient beauty "Come As You Are",  the jealous punk of "Lounge Act", and the stark acoustic strum of "Polly".	  While other grunge bands like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam were simply rehashed 70's arena rock, Nirvana combined a smart mixture of 70's punk, 60's pop, 80's indie and post-punk, to create some of the most vital music of their generation. No, Kurt Cobain can't shred; but he can write a better song then James Hetfield ever could.	  I can't imagine you reading this review; with sales of 10 million copies in the US, and 22 million copies worldwide, Just about anyone who would ever want Nevermind owns it by now. If you don't, get it. Rolling Stone ranked it the 17th greatest album ever; I'd rank it more towards 8-10. This is a true classic, in league with The Velvet Underground and Nico, Blonde On Blonde, and othre great albums.
0,some fun stuff on here.  My kid loves the sound
0,The debut album for Guns n' Roses was and will remain one of the greatest debuts of all time for a rock group. In a time where disco-pop music ruled the music scene, Guns n' Roses unleashed a new phase of rock which was at the time unsurpassable. Guns n' Roses brought raw, vicious rock n' roll to the charts as lead singer Axl Rose screeched lyrics about sex and drugs, and guitarist Slash smashed out brilliant guitar riffs.		Song by Song:		1. Welcome to the jungle: one of the three huge hits of this album. An outstanding beginning to one of the best rock n' roll albums of all time. Who can dislike it: "sha-na-na-na knees, knees!"		2. It's so easy: Although fairly underrated, this track is one of my favourites of the album. A wonderful opening guitar intro into the heavy rock side of the track. It is very well paced and contains a highly energetic beat to it. We here Axl go lower in this one and Duff Mcgackan backs it on vocals throughout the heavy track.		3. Night Train: It's your typical GNR song. Heavy, rockish guitar playing from Slash and Axl Rose unleashes the powerful chorus throughout the last minute of the song.		4. Out Ta Get Me: This track contains explicit lyrics which is the most appealing part of the song. Similar to night train, Axl is closing out the song screeching the chorus: "they're out ta get me, they won't catch me, cause I'm innocent!"		5. Mr. Brownstone: This song was written by bassist Duff and it is nothing short of brilliant. He explores the life of himself and Slash as they once struggled through a heroin addiction. This is probably the best song written by Duff in his time with GNR.		6. Paradise City: This track is an all-time favourite for most GNR fans. Axl is especially strong singing this track live, but of course the original is nothing short of brilliant. This touched many GNR fans including me and should be considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time.		7. My Michelle: This is a heavy, ugly rock song in the lyrical stand point. Rose shouts out lyrics relating to cocaine and sex in this track. It has a classic intro, somewhat similar to the intro of the "Use Your Illusion I" hit, "Don't Cry". However, this track becomes heavy and contains outstanding energy and excitement in the chorus.		8. Think about you: This track is one of the lightest in terms of the lyrics. This is a beautiful song that can be appreciated by most rock n' roll fans as a touching song.		9. Sweet Child O' Mine: This song made Guns n' Roses superstars. It begins with a beautiful guitar solo from Slash and then Axl begins singing the beautiful lyrical tune. This is probably GNR's best ballad.		10. You're Crazy: This is heavy, quick and entertaining. Non GNR fans won't like this song but it's a favourite for any hardcore GNR fan. It stays quick throughout and Axl delivers powerful lyrics. GNR Lies sticks in a slower paced, and sensational version of it if you're interested.		11. Anything Goes: This song relates to sex and is one of the weakest off Appetite for Destruction. It still contains an upbeat rock n' roll sound but lacks in the lyrical standpoint.		12. Rocket Queen: This is a nice way to end the album. It begins with a 45 second instrumental intro which leads into an all-around solid track.		Therefore, it is clear in my mind that this is a must own Metal album, featuring superb guitar riffs, awesome lyrics with a vengeance, and definitive and catchy tunes. A must buy for all metal fans and someone interested in GNR music.
0,I truly think that this is the best Black Sabbath recording with Ronnie James Dio as lead singer!  It is a solid album.  I had to listen to it a few times before I really liked it, but once I did, I liked it a lot.
0,great CD.  some of the classics sang as a great tribute
0,Very nice album.
0,I usually review Bat for Lashes and BJM and such, but a great songwriter is a great songwriter is a great song writer.  Ian Hunter has cranked out an incredible collection of guitar and piano rock and roll with his gravely Dylanesque voice that doesn't have a weak track on it.  Even the odd tribute to the Indian dude was great.  Ian Hunter is in the same category as Ray Davies and Bob Dylan and John Hiatt.  Just friggin great song writers who can't stop producing great songs year in and year out.		Ian Hunter belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame but then again, that's a joke and a stupid fraternity, but geez.  This album is amazing, whether it was produced by a guy in his twenties or a guy in his seventies.  Ageless, timeless killer rock and roll.
0,It's MJ what can I say!? It took me a while to appreciate the remixes and now I listen to those just on their own.
0,Vintage Letterman when part of falling in love in the 60's meant slow dancing to The Lettermen.
0,LOVE IT
0,If you love Ella and Sarah, etc., and miss them, you will love this album and load it on your mp3 player and relish it often. I give it an A+. Excellent accompanying musicians as well.
0,A Beautifult Album !!! I love it.
0,One of the best albums by one of the best artists, with heavy influence by one of the other best artists (Bowie).	This is a true classic that I never get tired of listening to!	The Bowie / Ronson influence and production of this album is strongly evident and enhances Lou's songwriting  to a new place and level post Velvet Underground.	This album is responsible for his only real "hit", Walk on the wild side. However the entire album and every song is equally as strong! It is a shame the remainder of the songs did not reach the same level of popularity with the masses, this album highlights Lou's songwriting capabilities and establishes his influence on the "now" ( circa 1972) Glam Rock movement in the UK.	Bowie was one of The Velvet Undergrounds biggest fans and the most vocal of the bands influence on what would become the Glam Rock Movement ( his own Ziggy Stardust album being one of the most popular examples of the genere and "hot off the presses"	at the time that Transform was produced).	Bowie and Ronson stepped in and offered to produce and help Lou with his next album after his first self titled Solo album in 1971 was such a big failure (after he quit the Velvet Underground in 1970).	The result of the teaming of Lou Reed, David Bowie, and Mick Ronson, produced one of the greatest Glam Rock and Lou Reed albums ever made.	40+ years later ( as of 2015), and this album and these songs still feel "fresh" and are just as fun to listen to as they were in 1972!	Vicious is a hard rocking in your face glam rock powerhouse, Satellite of Love, the best example ever of Lou's ability to create a strong melody despite his rough and raw singing voice, Walk on the Wild side, the all-time Classic hit that iconically waxes poetic the life of the NYC TV/ TS prostitute, Perfect Day, yet another Lou classic can bring tears to your eyes, it's a powerful ballad with strong metaphoric lyrics. The remaining songs on the album are also all gems, but do not stand out as much as the aforementioned.	If you do not own this album, buy it!!!	It remains one of my all-time favorites
0,Another of my favorites by Rory. Excellent from start to finish.
0,This soundtrack is magnificent and fits the LORT epic scale perfectly.  The Rohan theme inspires the views of grand mountain peaks and serene fields as well as a deep sense of duty and pain that the rulers of the city must cope with.  Whenever Sam and Frodo appeared, the sweet melody from the Shire was there to comfort and remind us that the purpose for the journey was to save all that was good.  Evenstar is quite possibly the saddest piece in all of the LOTR soundtracks, as it is used to tell the painfull story of Arwen's lost love and the sacrifice of eternal pain that she is willing to bear. The vocals in this soundtrack are absolutely stunning and are the single reason I'm such a fan of LOTR music.  Howard Shore did a wonderful job capturing the spirit of the story within each moment of the movie.  Every scene required his pieces to show the audience what was being experienced on screen.  A beautiful yet dark example of soundtracks at their best.
0,The Greatest Music Decade and so much wonderful music reasonably priced.
0,Had to replace this CD since my last one went to the Marines with my son!!!	Has some of his best songs on it!
0,Awesome Cd !!!
0,awesome
0,I've never found fault with much that Elvis has produced over the years.  Sure the braying, vibrato-laden voice requires suspension of certain critical impulses; and his tendancy to melodrama sometimes makes even the true believer waver.  But for me these are really small quibbles when faced with the astonishing level of quality this man has consistently achieved.  His lyrics conjure a complex range of associations that turn the denser songs into multi-faceted riddles.  And no other lyrics today have the same authority and authenticity.  Even if you don't know what the hell he's talking about, there's lots of fun in trying to figure it out (and singing along though your wife might leave you).  The combination of these lyrics sung with Elvis' supercharged intensity backed by the confident, relaxed band on this record have come together into something special.  This one really takes some time to get your head around, but when it clicks you realize it's the product of a mature master.
0,Great new find - awesome, talented performer.
0,I don't know what it is about this release but I haven't been able to get into it.  The music is good, but safe.  Lots of power chords and keys.  Its possible that if this was just music Id like it more, or maybe if vocalist Andy Kuntz spent less time singing on the album.  I like most of his vocals (though some are shrill here and there, and too many sustains) but its maybe too much singing, too much story, and I couldn't manage to get into the story/ narrative.  I know that this is a rock opera but the story doesnt move me.  I do appreciate the additional female vocals by Julia Steingass but when the two are harmonizing his voice overwhelms hers.  The overall package presentation and production is top notch, exactly what youd expect from these guys.  The albums strong suit is its beginning to end flow and its high quality.  The band isn't flashy and the musicianship is strong BUTits safe for a melodic progressive metal piece.  Favorite track simply because of that opening guitar rail: The King and the Children of Lost World.  If this is a first in a series of releases (as suggested by [Path One] in the albums title) along the same line Im not sure Ill be taking the second path.  3.75 stars.
0,very good
0,I give it 9/10. Don't get me wrong I love his growl, which I think has more of a grindcore influence myself (along the lines of Nile, or something of that sort), I just think it's overdone and gets very repetitive. The singer is very versatile and I just think his growl would pack more of a punch if used more sparingly (like On Broken Wings). The guitars and drums are SICK!!! Throw The Red Death, The Red Chord, Nile, and Psyopus in a blender and that's about the sound to expect. I originally bought this cd because they are on Black Market Activities, and I love every band on there. Definately not what I expected but in a good way. I don't listen to a lot of grind but am more partial to death metal, which is what this band was labeled under, although I believe them to be just as much grindcore as they are death metal and tech metal with some thrash and a little bit of hardcore. The production and artwork on this album are beyond amazing. This is the way technical/heavy-as-fu@# music should be produced. I can hear everything going on in the music without it being "sugar-coated". With 9 songs timed in at 27 mins only the last minute wasted (a phone call from someone talking sh$%).		Favorite Song: The Black Page
0,Avant returns with with his fourth CD, Director and while the CD doesn't come close to topping his My Thoughts CD, it does have some decent slow jams which Avant is known for,the CD opens with a the mid tempo track So Many Ways then goes into the blazing slow jam This Is Your Night, followed by the trio of singles You Know What, 4 Minutes and Stick With You all of wich have been radio staples for the past couple of months. Other stand out tracks include the truthful Right Place Wrong Time the sexual Director and the bitter sweet Now You Got Someone. Avant doesn't come close to having the best R&B CD of 2006, no that titles goes to NE-Yo's In My Own Words but he does continue to show promise.
0,I'll just say that this is her only release in which I have enjoyed every song. Standouts are Seven Deadly Sins, Ladybird, and Go Down Moses.
0,I was browsing around looking for something different and this was what I found. This is different ,for sure. I like it. It took me 3 listens before I decided that. You have to listen. '"Eleanor Rigby" knocked me out I think the Beatles would have liked it too,especially John.
0,Love it, thank You
0,A classic.
0,yes,,,, this is one of the baddest lps of the era,,,, sadly never played, parchman farm is one of the hardest rock cuts anywhere, the sound quality on this and  other cactus lps is amazing,,,heard jim mccarty was not well in 80s hope he is doing ok, appice is on a variety of lps, pick  this up if you don't already have it,,,, i called them the american led zeppelin,,,, and actually think they were better.,.............
0,I can't remember the last music review I wrote on Amazon.  My listening habits have gone away from CDs and over to Spotify (I pay the monthly fee), but I felt compelled to write a review for this album by The War on Drugs.		In my opinion, a truly great album must be a collection of amazing songs that leave you inspired, make you question humanity and force you to look inside yourself...perhaps more than you'd like.  When the album is over, you push play again because you want to keep living within it.		Those albums are increasingly rare, but Lost in the Dream hits all of those marks and then adds a different twist.  It creates an atmosphere that envelopes you, like an artist painting a canvas that you just want to disappear into.		While much of its brilliance lies in the music, the lyrics catch you by surprise.  "Lost in the dream...or just the silence of a moment.  It's always hard to tell."  Love that line.		The influences on this album are noticeable (Dylan, Tom Petty, Dire Straits) but that's part of its charm and the reason it's so comforting.  On the one hand it's not original but on the other hand I've never heard anything like it.  It's a complex album that makes me feel complete every time I listen to it.		I can't recommend this album enough.
0,So the Backstreet Boys became "larger than life" with MILLENNIUM. So far this is their biggest selling album. It's also my favorite BSB CD. It includes some of the best pop music ever. Take "shape of my heart" for example. It's just one of the best pop songs ever. Besides that MILLENNIUM includes other great songs. Another one of my faves is "I need you tonight." Nick gets to shine on that one. You can hear that he struggles a bit on the high notes but that doesn't make the song any less enjoyable.	"Don't want you back" and "the one" are awesome up-tempos. Vocally BSB hits the spot on every song. Nick also sounds a lot better on his solos. MILLENNIUM is a bit more on the ballad side. I think BSB's strength lies in ballads. They just sound so natural on songs like "don't wanna lose you now" and "no one else comes close." This is yet another pop must-have CD.
0,Perfect
0,great song. CD single is in mint condition.  I received it very fast.  Cant complain about the price.
0,4.5 stars		Let us start by discarding the words "art rockers" and in turn highlight the cathartic impact you experienced when listening for the first time to the wonderful Brooklyn band TV On The Radio''s 2006 masterwork, "Return to Cookie Mountain" which was the musical equivalent of "shock and awe" assault on your senses. It seemed to put them in a unique musical category all of their own with artists such as David Bowie paying homage and so far in front of their peers it was almost embarrassing. There appearance on David Letterman's show performing the epic "Wolf like me" was a dark delight and an internet sensation. Incredibly somehow in 2008 it got better upon the release of their last album "Dear Science" which won so many "best of" end of year lists that a uninformed neutral observer could have alleged poll rigging, not knowing that they deserved all the accolades and much more besides. Since then however the band has gone off in various solo directions and "Nine types of light" has been released to little fanfare which is shame since it is their most accessible and commercial album to date and by any standards a inviting yet thoughtful piece of music, jam packed with optimistic warm grooves and forlorn lyrics. But let us not despair that somehow this is the TVOTR mainstream pop "sell out" album. Not at all since "Nine types of light" has the customary edge you expect from this band and enough delicate and raw experimentation to separate it from the very run of mill preoccupations of the recent release by those other New York "pioneers" The Strokes.		It starts perversely with "Second song" with its almost spoken lyrics, which leads to a falsetto funk workout of such dirty hue that you will feel the need for a cleansing shower. Next up "Keep your heart" is an obvious single and great slice of pop music packed with huge bass lines, while "You" is an immediate highlight with it almost high funk style vocal and dark backdrop. The trippy ballad "Killer Crane" is one of the albums gentler more reflective moments and on first hearing is one of the weaker tracks, although you suspect that this very untypical TVOTR track (with what sounds like a banjo in the mix?) could be one of the albums delicious slow burners. It is followed by the brilliant single "Will do" which starts with chiming glockenspiel type notes and is located in that territory which TV on the Radio literally "own and is a distant relative of "Love dog". Throughout you detect various influences from James Brown, Jane's Addiction, Living Colour and most of all Prince. You suspect that if the purple squiggly one was to hear "New Cannonball Run" his colour with turn green with envy. The synth funk of "Repetition" is another song jam packed with vocal variation and pulsating rhythms, although the fade out does unfortunately match the title. The last two songs are almost funk metal with "Caffeinated Consciousness" in particular starting like Radiohead's "Talk show host" and evolving into a rock rap backed by a big riff.		Its difficult in a review to capture the darker shades and nuances in this album with simple song structures becoming complex and distorted. This is combined with a enough twists and turns to keep TVOTR aficionados fully on board. "Nine types of light" is the sound of a band not necessarily pushing the envelope but consolidating. The relentless experimentation of some of their past records is not to the fore here but what is firmly in place is a level of top notch musicianship and a heady chunk of general excellence which means that we can be hugely satisfied with this scintillating record.
0,Still takes a bit of getting used to. It's rougher than any of the studio albums, and admittedly some of the songs are a little underdeveloped. For instance, "The Sound of Music" could probably have been great, but as it is sounds like a demo. "Glass" is better, but still a far cry from the visceral, haunting music that Joy Division is known for (although for their first single, it's not a bad job). Furthermore, "The Only Mistake" suffers from Ian's vocals being a bit too muted, which makes it sound overlong, though otherwise it's a good effort.	But wait! We also have "The Kill," an impossibly fast number with one of the band's best hooks; "Ice Age," an atypically harsh song with a riff from hell and some lyrical imagery to match; the memorable "Walked in Line" with its martial sound. There is also a bona fide classic in the wrenching "Dead Souls," available elsewhere and relatively well known, about which no criticism is even theoretically possible. The others, "Exercise One" and "Something Must Break," are extremely intriguing and marvelously evocative. Both conjure up a mental image of riding in a train across a desolate landscape with their haunting guitar/synth leads, and both are likely to get extensive replays.	Oh yeah, there's a live concert here too. But given the price of the CD, I can safely consider it a nice extra. As such, it's pretty good, and valuable for "Ceremony," one of the only two existing recordings of the song with Ian on vocals. "Isolation" is good too. This cannot be said for "Sister Ray" and some of the other tracks, but overall it's an interesting enough inclusion. I cannot for the life of me fathom the "EXPLICIT LYRICS" warning on the CD, however. It's probably because of the aforementioned "Sister Ray," but given that a) it's the only possible cause of this label and b) it's not even a Joy Division song, I have trouble seeing the rationalization. Oh well.
0,Beegie was one of the best pianists ever!!!  I salute her as she salutes the greatest!		Definitely music for "older folks".  (notice I said "older", not old, not seniors....just "older"!
0,Sly &The Family Stones best album!
0,This is a quite spectacular release. Bronfman's approach to all three works is deeply considered, thoughtful and individual though with an unerring understanding of the style and what makes these sonatas work. The performances are technically impeccable, the melodic lines excellently articulated and the overall conception of the individual works entirely convincing - still, there is no shortage of color and range of expression. In short, this is among the most convincing cycles of Prokofiev piano sonatas out there, and although I wouldn't want to be without certain other especially individual performances (such as Pogorelich's idiosyncratic but magnificent sixth, or the glorious Richter performance), this is a superb choice.		The masterpiece that is the sixth sonata does in fact receive a scintillating performance, full of drama but also finesse and detail, and Bronfman pulls it together to a truly convincing whole. In the fourth Bronfman displays a marvelous range of mood and interpretative depth with a, well, coruscating and lyrically intense slow movement. The first sonata may be a less rewarding work, but Bronfman handles it with panache as well; it is full of energy and again Bronfman shapes the melodic lines and the narrative structure superbly. These performances are, in short, major contenders in the repertoire, and they receive very good sound; strongly recommended.
0,loved it
0,This album was and still is a classic. I played it for my son and he was impressed. Had never heard these songs before. If these guys could have submerged their ego's and stayed together they would be considered one of the greatest rock groups ever.
0,There are good songs in this CD, my favorites are Get off, Rrrrock and Hot number. They made me dance when I was younger. But there's a problem with the CD: When I heared the songs some strange "clicks" appeared, like in a vinyl disc, maybe a mistake in some phase of the entire recording process. Good music, the CD could be better.
0,Gram Parsons first appeared in the musical spotlight in the summer of 1968 with the Byrds. Joining Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman the three musicians put together a country landmark called 'Sweetheart Of The Rodeo'. Shortly after the album's release Parsons and Hillman split from the Byrds to form their own band with bassist Chris Etheridge and slide guitarist Sneeky Pete. The Flying Burrito Brothers were born and their first album 'The Gilded Palace Of Sin' was definetly a far better album than 'Sweetheart Of The Rodeo' which is a masterpeice on it's own.	The opening song CHRISTINE'S TUNE is a classic up beat country rock tune that is one of the best songs of 1969. SIN CITY is a very deep haunting country song. DO RIGHT WOMAN is a beautiful love ballad. DARK END OF THE STREET is a classic and one of my faves here. MY UNCLE is more upbeat with shades of blue grass music. WHEELS is an easy going country tune that seems laid back. JUANITA is another beautiful love ballad.  The two true highlights here are the beautiful ballad HOT BURRITO#1 and the upbeat rocker HOT BURRITO #2. DO YOU KNOW HOW IT FEELS is also very laid back. The closing track HIPPIE BOY is okay but the whole preaching thing seems quite dated but the story it tells is heartbreaking.	Gilded Palce Of Sin is a brilliant country rock landmark album that influenced such bands as the Eagles among others. However at the time of it's release in Febuary of 1969 the album was a commercial flop. Peaking at mere #164 on the billboard charts however time has been kind to this album because it is huge nowdays.	Overall I highly recommend 'Gilded Palace Of Sin'. Even if you hate country music you should like this. It really changes your look on the genre entirely. I used to hate country but this got me hooked to a certain degree. Highly recommended!
0,First heard, 'Line of Fire' at the end of an episode of, 'Elementary'. Been a big fan of Junip since. Not a bad track on this album.
0,I had this CD once before and wore it out.  Needed a new one.  Cant say enough good about this CD.  No one will regret their purchase.
0,I was very happy with the picture quality and color.  If this is a favorite from your youth, the purchase is a no-brainer.
0,Great cd
0,To put it simply Adele rocks!!
0,As a fan of Game of Thrones, I find the music to be one of the many elements that makes the show as great as it is.  Composer Ramin Djawadi has scored every episode of this show from the very beginning, including this fifth season.  Every year I await not only the new season of the show, but also the new soundtrack album.		The album begins with the Main Theme for "Game of Thrones" (which is one of my favorite TV themes), and then moves into a wonderful mix of new and old music.  A few tracks are really unique - I especially enjoy the vocals in "High Sparrow" and "Atonement".  There is a nice balance of quiet/somber tracks and intense ones.		Given that this is the show's fifth season, Djawadi does have a lot of existing material to pull from, and he reuses a few of the major themes quite often. If you've heard the previous albums, some of the music will be a bit repetitive. But I've come to really love the show's musical themes, and enjoy hearing some of the same-old stuff in a slightly new arrangement and/or context every season.		FAVORITE TRACKS:	[2] Blood of the Dragon	[9] Dance of Dragons	[13] Atonement
0,What an incredible trio of talented musicians/singers.  Nickel Creek is sometimes hard to define into a genre (which is a good thing!).  At times, they have their country/bluegrass feel, other times folk, and other times pop rock.  Chris's voice is very different from other singers, especially for a band that utilizes fiddles!  His voice is very similar to Relient K's lead singer, Matthew Thiessen, except that Relient K is a pop-punk rock group!  The song that really blew me away though was the cover of Bob Dylan's "Tomorrow Is A Long Time."  Sara's voice is heavenly and has such great emotion that you really can feel that she believes every line she is singing.  As a Dylan fan, I love when a group can do a cover without trying to imitate Dylan and they can make it like their own (plus it's cool with changing the pronouns so a woman can sing).  Other songs I enjoyed were: Somebody More Like You, Jealous of the Moon, Scotch and Chocolate (great instrumental song!), Doubting Thomas, and When In Rome.  Nickel Creek has the ability to play such a broad scale of music and has such great vocalists who can lead sing as well as harmonize that it will be interesting to see where they go from here.  And I think it is important to note that this is the only Nickel Creek CD I have or have heard and that I am not a country fan (except for Johnny Cash or some folk/country styles like Sandra McCracken).  All in all, I recommend this CD to those who like country music but despise country vocals (because they all sound the same - and not very good!).
0,Came exactly as it was described THAAANKS
0,Much of the back-and-forth between the positive and negative reviews here seems to be over Klemperer's conception of "Die Zauberflote".  Few criticize the exquisitely beautiful, sublime, noble music that he creates here, but some react negatively to the lack of theatricality, or the absence of spoken dialogue.  These two complaints are not unrelated.  Klemperer INSISTED on ommitting the dialogue, because he felt it was superfluous.  After listening to this recording and to, for example, Bohm's DGG recording from around the same time, I could not agree more.  For what makes "Die Zauberflote" really great is not the drama, but the music.  As Richard Osborne very acutely observes in the liner notes, in the drama Tamino is a strangely unheroic hero, the Queen of the Night is the villain who is given exquisitely beautiful music, and Papageno is a buffoon who has strong heroic tendencies; in addition, Sarastro, the moral center of the opera and the music, plays little real role in the evolution of Act II, more like a shadowy presence.  What we have here is, quite apparently, similar to what would come later with Fidelio.  The characters as they stand in the drama are cardboard cut-outs, but that is not the point of the opera: in both works, the composers have something profound to express, and do so through these contradictory characters.  Klemperer realises this, and the result is one of the truly great recordings.  He reveals detail and structure usually ignored by others (just compare the way that Klemperer shapes the Overture to the rather unimaginative way Bohm treats it).  In addition, the singing is beyond all praise, from Janowitz's achingly beautiful Pamina all the way to the Three Ladies (two of whom are Schwarzkopf and Ludwig; what a cast!).  The Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus as usual are excellent.  In short, if you are interested in Mozart at his most beautiful and profound, this is the recording for you; if you are interested in a more theatrical reading, less focused on the music per se, then I recommend the Bohm, or better yet, actually see a stage production.
0,Don't let the name fool you, Lil'Kim to me and to many others who have listen to hip hop over the years know for a fact you can't get any better lyrics then this woman. She calls herself the Queen Bi*ch for a reason and her many fans as well as haters know her as the Queen of Rap. Hardcore proves that as well,this album is a classic, Rated 5 stars by Rolling Stone. The albums addictive beats and outstanding sexual lyrics is just 1 of many skills Kim can do, she also raps about the streets as well as relationships that gone wrong. Songs like No Time and crush on you (the Lil'Cease version no Lil'Kim in this song unless you get the Not Tonite single that contains her on the the track) are very catchy and Drugs and others stand out as well. If you love hip hop make sure you add this to your collection you won't regret it.
0,With FAITHFULLY as her third album to her belt, Faith Evans has never sounded more confident. With long-term producer P. Diddy, Ms. Evans glosses up her vocals into a hybrid of Minnie Ripperton and Ella Fitzgerald to elicit an undercurrent of melancholic blues in mid-tempo 70s sounding love ballads like the beautiful "I Love you", "Faithfully" et al. Collaborating with newcomer Michaelangelo Saulsberg, the first blazing single "YOU GETS NO LOVE" showcases Ms. Evans smooth grasp with the beats - yet songs like Alone in this world and Brand New Man are what Ms. Evans sounds best at. An infusion of vulnerability and intoxicating soul, she relates her own tragedy of losing her husband and croons out her loneliness and devastating betrayal with the heart-rendering tunes. FAITHFULLY is Ms. Evans most accomplished album to date so far, yet it is a pity that the scope of the songs largely deals with love - falling in and out of passion. Songs like DO YOUR TIME expresses conviction towards love, WHERE WE STAND speaks on doubts on love. Ms. Evans can certainly take on bigger roles and experiment with more upbeat tunes, but fans of her smoldering vocals will no doubt be enchanted to her faithful self and personal style n this album.
0,The third New Riders album Gypsy Cowboy was released in December 1972 and is the last one to be co produced by Steve Barncard. Guests include Carlene DiDomenico, Donna Jean Godchaux, Richard Greene, Mark Naftalin, and Jack Schroer. The album opens with Dave Torbert's spacy title song Gypsy Cowboy before giving way to John Dawson's hot and upbeat Whiskey which is sure to get your toes tapping. Dave's Groupie is a nice rock and roll number while Sutter's Mill is a nice little tune. Death And Destruction is a massive John Dawson song with great lyrics and fantastic playing by the entire band. John's Linda starts the second half in a nice mood with a great country feel. Dave's sweet On My Way Back Home comes next and was actually used for Radio Caroline for many years. John's Superman dates back to the band's earliest days but appears here for the first time. David Nelson's gets his first lead vocal on the covers of She's No Angel and Long Black Veil which has David and John trading vocals. The album ends with a breezy John song called Sailin'.		The New Riders released their fourth album, The Adventures of Panama Red, in October 1973. It was the first to not be produced/co produced by Steve Barncard but instead Nashville producer Norbert Putnam was brought in. As a result, the album has more of a traditional country flavor. The album features guest appearances by Donna Jean Godchaux, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Matthew Kelly, The Memphis Horns as well as Norbert playing on a song. The song opens with Peter Rowan's Panama Red sung by David Nelson which would become one of the band's best known songs. Dave Torbert's It's Alright With Me is a nice rocker and is followed by the second Peter Rowan cover on the album Lonesome L.A. Cowboy sung by John Dawson. Dave turns in another rocker called Important Exportin' Man which is co written by Tim Hovey. Tim Hovey was a famous child actor who became a roadie for the Grateful Dead and would Kingfish's sound man as well as co writing a couple of their songs. The first half of the album ends with John's One Too Many Stories while the second half begins with Robert Hunter's Kick In The Head sung by Dave Torbert. John's You Should Have Seen Me Running is followed by David Nelson doing a cover of Teardrops In My Eyes. Dave does a cover of the pretty L.A. Lady. Dave's stunning Thank The Day is next and the album ends with Cement, Clay and Glass written by Spencer Dryden and David Nelson, sung by David, ending the album. Both albums get a 5 star but I do prefer the first three a tad more than Panama Red. Dave Torbert was also becoming frustrated with the band and would leave to join Kingfish by the time the next record, which was the live Home, Home On The Road, was released. Comes with a nice booklet that also includes the inside cover art for Panama Red.
0,That's no bull--in the song "Aviator", whose intonation and phrasing would make it possible for it to be done by a country act anyway. Not surprising when you think of it--this is the same outfit that did a pretty faithful cover of a Neil Diamond number ("Kentucky Woman") early on in their career. DP's draft of Steve Morse to replace Ritchie Blackmore worked out better than maybe they even foresaw. I'm not going to argue Morse's technical prowess over Blackmore--that's largely a question of taste. But Morse's mandolin in "Aviator" means he's got Blackmore beat all hollow on versatility. Only time will tell how that will work in the long run.
0,One of the last of the real Hotel California era Eagles
0,I had only heard the hit song from this cd.  The first listen through I was a little disappointed.  The hit is so good.  But the second time through, the other songs got their own chance and won me over.
0,Richard Hawley -a favorite of Nancy Sinatra and Ryan Adams- may just have earned a place in the lineage of singers and songwriters who have a legitimate gift for genuine romanticism, in a tradition wide enough to include Bacharach, Scott Walker, Dion and Roy Orbison.	I know that's quite a strong statement to make, yet Hawley belongs there by his capacity to evoke a certain nostalgia and joy of true romance that is authentic and exquisitely crafted, without ever indulging in trite sentimentality.	Whether you are already familiar with Hawley or not, Coles Corner, his most accomplished album thus far, is a perfect place to take delight on this man's work. Hawley has a distinct voice tone and sense of phrasing that can conjure up the many moods of love that many of us have felt, and that those people mentioned before have so memorably expressed.	I would add that the fact that these songs are written by him may clearly contribute to the confidence and credibility of his delivery. Whether it is the longing in his voice in "Coles Corner" or "Wait For Me," which reminded me of Orbison, or the romantic pleas of "The Ocean" or "Born Under A Bad Sign," he hits the mark.	Another remarkable fact is that Hawley is not even a singer first, his guitar work -a fixture in Pulp's sound in recent years- is what he's been originally recognized for, and in this album he confirm that too. This is one of those rare cases of virtuosity without showing off, confessional without self-consciousness, gorgeous chords and subtle solos weaving seamless stories between words and melodies.	Coles Corner, it's conveyed in the liner notes, was a place where everyone in Sheffield met -specially those looking for romance- and although, many of us were never there, it would feel like a familiar place. Whatever "your corner" was called, or my memory takes me, this music could probably be how those places sounded when we looked for love.
0,great
0,Enjoyed this DVD, but would have liked to have seen more of Mott's greatest hits on it. What there was, was done very well.
0,One of the things that initially attracted me to my wife of over 35 years was our common possession of Keely Smith's Politely, surely one of the best vocal recordings still in our collection -- and now out on CD. Every time I listen to it I wonder what it must have been like to have such a magnificent talent that just never made out of the shadows of Ella, Sarah Vaughan and some of the other vocalists of her generation. Well, folks, there's something to be said about discipline, persistence and the blessings of a mature age.	OK, on this recording Keely doesn't have quite the sweet voice of old, that lilting invitation to just wonderful listening and more than a handful of romantic visions about a part-Native American from Virginia ('Injun' to her friend Frank Sinatra)who was hitched to that wild man Louis Prima. But in some ways the voice is a little stronger, and more confident and mature. A 300 dollar bottle of wine.  Not unlike Sinatra's or Tony Bennett's in their early 70s. Listen to her renditions of New York, New York, and Without a Song and you'll sit up straight. Fast. And, the romantic lilt is still there if you'd just like to recline with your eyes shut.	The Concord recording quality and arrangements are just superb (I did notice that her voice is a little more comfortably forward on a surround system than traditional stereo), as is the album's packaging. This is a real classy production and swing fans among us should be mighty grateful to Concord and Keely Smith, who produced the album. ...
0,Definitely a different angle for the Peppers, but not at all out of place following Californication.  It took a couple of listens for the song hooks to sink in, but now that I've heard the CD many times, the songs just stay in your head.  This is great music from one of the best bands still actually making REAL music, not processed synthesized ... .  Loved the albums they made when they were younger, and love the mature work too!
0,What a blast from the past!
0,I am not a long term Incubus fan. My first song of their's was Stellar, my first album was Morning View. After spending time around other Incubus fans, I learned that there was so much more to Incubus than Morning View and their poppy single "Drive". I bought S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (Incubus's album before Make Yourself) and fell in love!	For those of you who are new to Incubus... I'm sure you've heard their single "Drive" on the radio. They started off as a metal band (described by some as metal/funk/rap) and are constantly changing their style. Incubus is one of the few rock bands with a DJ. Their lead singer Brandon Boyd has a beautiful unique singing style (which I have heard being compared to Rob Thomas's style of singing) and their guitarist Mike E. (I won't even try to spell his last name) is creative beyond imagination.	SCIENCE is definitely more hardcore than Make Yourself and Morning View, so fans who are scared away by songs such as "When It Comes" and "Make Yourself" and prefer LFO to Hoobastank are strongly encouraged not to buy this album.	Telling you about each individual track is fun, but will not help you in deciding to buy this CD, but I will tell you that it's fun, heavy, and pure. Incubus's lyrics are as heavy as the guitar chords, and the music itself is complex. For those of the faint heart, there is a bit of swearing, but more for effect and emotion than to just catch your attention.	Any fan of Incubus or heavy rock shoul buy this album!!!
0,To any prog-lover who does not know PENDRAGON: it is time to get aquianted! With NOT OF THIS WORLD these guys have delivered probably the single best album of 2001 (although UNDER THE SUN's debut album comes very close, see my review of that one as well), but more important this is also an album that ranks as one of the strongest prog releases ever. Songs like IF YOU WERE THE WIND (AND I WAS THE RAIN), GREEN EYED ANGEL, DANCE OF THE 7 VEILS, and A MAN OF NOMADIC TRAITS should be enough to make any real prog fans mouth water, and the lyrics are very 'real' and heartfelt. The level of musicianship is very high and NICK BARRET (guitar, vocals) CLIVE NOLAN (keys), FUDGE SMITH (drums), and PETE GEE (bass) play together with incredible precision and feeling. I also really love Barrett's very 'English' vocals (some people don't), and his unusual voice helps put a lot of heart into these songs. To say that Pendragon are a band who deserve far more attention and respect is an enormous understatement. I am an older prog fan (now in my mid-50's) who lived through the 'glory days' when Emerson Lake & Palmer, Yes, Genesis, Procol Harum, and Pink Floyd were all selling gold records and filling football stadiums (and Kansas, Supertramp & Rush were considered the 'new guys' on the block!), listening to Pendragon today gives me that same feeling of being part of something special that the rest of the world just doesn't understand! (ahhhhhh, prog!) NOT OF THIS WORLD features some of the most rousing, involving, and heart-tugging music I've heard in my life, and it is one of the only albums I've ever heard that stirred the emotions so much it made me cry (see GREEN EYED ANGEL). most of this is due to the fact that Barrett is one of the best songwriters in the buisness. I am a musician (guitar, bass, keys) I always say that it is not how many notes a minute you can play, but what's in the SONGWRITING that separates the great bands from the mearly 'OK' bands - Pendragon hits the 'great' mark with songs that are extremely well-constructed, strong in melody and harmony, and flawlessly arranged. I believe that these guys rank right alongside the quality level of all the great progressive rock bands of the past, and may even be a little bit better in terms of being consistant, by this I mean that Yes, Genesis, and even the mighty EL&P had their embarrassing turns to commercialism (90125, Abacab, Love Beach), whereas Pendragon have stayed dedicated to progressive rock, and never embarrassed themselves with lousy "hit singles" or filler material. If you're a prog fan hungry for quality music, check out Pendragon's NOT OF THIS WORLD (and try UNDER THE SUN too), you won't be sorry you did!
0,Wasn't a keen fan in 60's when I liked folk music. Have changed  as words & settings are evocative & pure folk!!
0,My wife and I are not big country music fans, because we didn't grow up with that medium playing on the radio in upstate NY.  However, we like some country and Chely is a nice addition to our collection of CD's.  We appreciate that the music is automatically downloaded to our smart phone if we buy a CD from Amazon.  We also respect Chely for her stand on gay rights.  It took a lot of courage for her to come out given how and where she was raised.  Not such a big deal for those of us living in the progressive state of New York.
0,Great music.
0,After 3 REALLY GREAT albums, where the first(CORE), in my opinion is a MASTERPIECE, STONE TEMPLE PILOTS created this No 4 album.....It's BY FAR their heaviest album, where you can hear heavy guitars through ALL the songs like DOWN, PRUNO, SEX AND VIOLENCE and HEAVEN E HOT RODS, also got 2 cool ballads like SOUR GIRL and ATLANTA....well, it's the last one i really enjoy from these guys.....GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!
0,Best CSN album in my collection
0,I yield to no man when it comes to admiring Jimi Hendrix - indeed, watching and listening to him perform in a tiny club, way back in '67, was one of the highlights of my life.  It was transformational.  That said, let's be honest about Band of Gypsies - it's a mess.  Of course, the failures of Hendrix transcend the triumphs of mortals, but still.		Hendrix freely admitted that he was no great singer, and his limitations have never been more evident.  Even Buddy Miles, who was better, sounds awful.  Perhaps the live concert environment meant they couldn't hear themselves.  Indeed, this album would have been much better had there been no vocals at all.  The jams, naturally, smoke like a southbound train, Hendrix is in great form.  But play the CD again and imagine how much better it would sound purely instrumental.		Swapping out Mitch Mitchell for Buddy Miles was like trading in a Rolls Royce for a Yugo, Miles is particularly unexceptional here.  The bass contribution by Billy Cox could have been handled just as well by a table lamp.  Most egregious of all is the material itself.  From a song-writing point of view there is little to cheer, particularly when it comes to lyrics.  This would be more palatable if the singing were expert; unfortunately, the awkward vocals Hendrix delivers draw attention to the inadequacies of the lyrics.		Of course it's worth owning and listening to, but, for a variety of reasons, it is just not up to the standards of the 3 "Experience" albums.
0,If you only buy one Dave Brubeck or only hear one Dave Brubeck album in your lifetime this is the album you need to hear. Realesed in 1959 a year of great jazz albums including many of the greats, "Kind of Blue", "The Shape Of Jazz To Come", "Mingus Ah Um", and "Time Out", respectively. By 1959 jazz was stretching out in new forms and ideas and this album on proves this statement even more. Time Out is based upon the use of time signatures that were very unusaul for jazz at the time like, waltz, double waltz time etc. Even though Time Out was intended for an experiement the album has become one of the best selling greatest jazz albums of all time and in 2005 it was one of 50 recordings chosen for preservation in the Library Of Congress, so what are you waiting for? If you still haven't heard this album than go out and buy it today.
0,Great album, highly recommend.
0,very good
0,this is a awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do.
0,I told a friend I was looking for some new music, and they referred me to Circa Survive.  This was after I told them a bunch of different bands I listened to regularly, which ranged from Evanescence to Rush.		I'm not saying it sounds like either, and although my review cannot cast a history with these band members, who hail from former bands now apparently defunct, what I can do is tell you what I think of this CD.		Vocals are refreshing; songwriting seems good, not too deep but still intelligent and meaningful.  The musicianship overall was better than I expected, with many change ups and flowing harmonies that all flow together well from track to track.  I must say it did not necessarily garner my immediate attention, but as of this writing I've listened to the entire CD 5 times now, and considering I just received it today, that says a lot.  I think if you are looking for some rock music that is experimental but not very heavy, and something that is "different" without being a "project album", then give the Juturna album a try.  I debated picking up their other one but by now I'm hooked.  Just a good mix of songs that have just enough of a hook to allow a listener to also explore the other factors of sound and lyrics that this band offers.  I know they didn't fall off the train yesterday, but I have a good feeling Circa Survive might be around a while!
0,Love it........all of it.........every bit of it.......always have since my first listen. He is a supernatural mystic. Take me there Bruce.
0,One of the all time greatest works of metal. Almost every song a classic.
0,great DVD just as a suspected, Anne Murray disappoints anyone?? I don't think so arrived as stated  would do business with this seller again high recommend.
0,I own most of Jackson Browne's other albums.  I feel I can review this album as a result.  There is  a social consciousness to his music.  Most of the note worthy new tracks are from the album the "Naked Ride Home".  He sings about war and violence in America in the song "Casino Nation".  He sings about domestic abuse in the very touching tune "In The Shape Of A Heart".  He sings about how friends depend on each other for survival in the song "My Stunning Mystery Companion".  "The Night Inside Me" is an excellent song about searching for freedom and a place in the world.  "Sky Blue and Black" is a lovely song about having hope in times of despair.  "Somebody's Baby" is a classic song about a special girl.  Redneck Friend is just a fun upbeat song.  Jackson Browne is one of the best musicians out there.  These songs are great.
0,Frank Sinatra is probably the greatest American singer--ever. I sing a little bit, and have always thought my excellent ear came from listening to Frank's legendary LPs at Capitol in the 1950s when I was a boy. That was Sinatra at his peak. I would sit for hours listening to those records, wondering how Frank could sound so perfect. No one else sounded like that. Very special. Takes talent, you could say. A talent for expression--of the purest kind.	The Reprise era in the 1960s, I always thought, was a step down--for various reasons. But listening to this excellent album is just a reminder as to how great a singer Sinatra was. These are some of Frank's best efforts in the 60s--mostly, and he sounds wonderful. The recordings are great--I suspect better reproductions than the originals. Charles Pignone is an old Sinatraphile who knows all the good stuff, and he has done a great job with this album, and with a number of other recent re-releases--notably the Jobim collection. Well done, sir.
0,A pianist who made his mark with spare and precise recordings of Bach, Gould here shows a romantic and passionate side that may surprise many listeners unfamiliar with this regrettably small portion of his discography. Gould himself thought these recordings among his best, and I wouldn't quarrel. Over the years, I've listened to just about every recording of the Intermezzi ever made, and while Gould's has its drawbacks (notably his notorious humming and the now less-than-stellar sound quality) they're still my favorites by a league. If only he had returned to the Intermezzi to take advantage of digital recording technology! The recording of the Ballades, on the other hand, is not only a fine interpretation but also sonically good. The 4th is especially moving.
0,Plays great, in a soft cover, which I personally like better than hard because they are more durable, esp when dropped.
0,This video is a treasure.  The audio and video is excellent, and the additional current interviews add greatly to the enjoyment of seeing this show.		I was at Woodstock in 1969 and just returned from the 40th anniversary, so I was recently transported back in time, more due to reconnecting with old friends.  The Moody Blues have always been one of my favorite bands and it's really a shame they werent' at Woodstock.  The music this group produces is wonderful, but beyond the music is a soul and connection this group is able to convey and draw its listeners (participants) in to, and connect on a much higher transcended level.		This DvD is an absolute must have for any Moody Blues fan, but also for any one that just enjoys great music and songs that are guaranteed to fill you with warmth, love, compassion, and take you higher.
0,This album is the black sheep of the Red Hot Chili Peppers family. Recorded during their extremely unstable mid-90s period, the album is one of the band's most reviled. Being over ten years old now, perhaps we are able to gain a fresh perspective on One Hot Minute. Of course, it was recorded with a new guitarist after the departure of John Frusciante, however that new guitarist happened to be Jane's Addiction axeman Dave Navarro. Dave's an awesome guitarist and he did a great job on this record.		Comparing One Hot Minute with the Peppers' recently released double album Stadium Arcadium, you might be amazed that they're both by the same band. Stadium Arcadium is melodic with intricate melodies and musicianship and lots of abstract, almost poetic lyrics. One Hot Minute on the other hand is a hard rock record with lots of heavy guitar, lots of profanity, the songs aren't nearly as melodic, and the lyrics are certainly not nearly as impressive. So it's not a big serious piece of art like Stadium Arcadium, it's just a fun rock record. I'm a big fan of this album, and quite a few of the songs are really memorable (for me, anyways). The best songs would be Coffee Shop, Warped, One Big Mob, Falling Into Grace, Shallow Be Thy Game and Walkabout. I challenge anyone who says this album is terrible to listen to Walkabout (track number 8) and tell me you don't enjoy the heck out of it. It's one of my favorite Peppers tracks.		Fans who like the intricate, mellow, soulful sounds of Californication and By The Way may not be into this record so much. But if you like the Chili Peppers best when they're rocking out and having a good time, do check out One Hot Minute and turn it up loud.
0,"It's a powerful thing, more than three words and a diamond ring, it can open up the heavens, make the angels sing. Our love baby is a powerful thing."  WHERE YOUR ROAD LEADS is a powerful CD featuring the hits "There Goes My Baby" and "I'll Still Love You More."  "Love Wouldn't Lie To Me" is a beautiful but melancholy tune and "Wouldn't Any Woman," "Heart Like A Sad Song," and "I Don't Want to Be The One" are terrific cuts.  The CD also features a duet with Garth Brooks, the title song, "Where Your Heart Leads."  Lyrics are included on the inserts.
0,Baillie and the boys is somewhat of a misnomer - for most of their existence, they have been just Kathie Baillie and her husband, Michael Bonagura. A third member joined them for a few years (hence the name Boys) and was still with them when they recorded their first two albums but left before this album was recorded. Kathy, possessor of a pure, clear voice, is the lead singer and also plays acoustic guitar. Michael adds some backing vocals but mainly plays guitars - acoustic and electric.	Most of the songs here are originals but there are two incredible covers - as good as any other versions of the songs that I've heard. These are Perfect (originally by Fairground Attraction who had a British number one hit with hit) and Fool such as I (originally a country song by Hank Snow but best known via Elvis Presley's cover).	The remaining songs include Can't stand to be unhappy (later covered by Bobbie Cryner) and You better do better (later covered by Brenda Lee) but I've not heard any other versions of the remaining songs, all of which are excellent.	If you enjoy country music of the late eighties and early nineties, you ought to like Baillie and the boys. I never got round to buying any of their other albums but I was assured that this was the best album they ever did. It is certainly difficult to image how they could have recorded a better one.
0,This is one my favorite Cat albums, probably because it was one of the first I ever listened to and because it contains the song Katmandu. I remember being around 6 or 7 and sneaking my sister LP and putting it on my turntable. Katmandu is probably my all time favorite song, it that it just takes me away. No matter where I am or what I'm doing, I hear the first notes of that song and I imagine myself overlooking the Himalayas from a snowy Tibetan monastery. It's freaky, I feel as though I'm literally transported there.  It's a very powerful feeling coming from a hauntingly beautiful song, and it's been that way for 30 years.	There are the other standouts - Trouble, I Think I See The Light, and Lady d'Arbanville are my overall standouts (Funny thing about that last one - it was about Cat's girlfriend at the time. Apparently she was really excited that he wrote the song about her and she loved it until she really paid attention to the words. "Hey - I'm Dead!" Apparently she didn't take to kindly to being dead in the song...)	Anyway, I can see how some of the other songs can be dated. They are good, but I have never really been over impressed with them, especially with Lilywhite. However, Katmandu alone is worth the album, and since ever a mediocre Cat song is better than 99% of the garbage on the airways today, you really can't go wrong.
0,Worried that the folk-music fad was luring listeners away from the blues, Chess Records directed Waters to record with acoustic instruments. These sessions-by Waters, Willie Dixon and a young Buddy Guy-went astonishingly well, and this pioneering "unplugged" set is beloved by blues and folk fans alike.
0,Melody has become hard to come by in so much of the music being written for today. For a simple comparison all one has to do is listen to the classical pieces that remain among the most popular music still enjoyed in the 21st century--the many works of Tchaikovsky, Debussy, Beethoven, et cetera. Therein, it becomes easy to appreciate the importance that melody plays in forging our individual emotional bond with such timeless music.	The soundtrack to the Imax film "Journey Into Amazing Caves" highlights the music of arguably the most melodic rock group of the past 30+ years--The Moody Blues. Clearly, as you listen to these latest tracks from the venerable band, the guitar and songwriting skills of Justin Hayward continue to remain in the forefront. Immerse yourself in the ethereal, guitar-driven instrumental "Water". Catch the easily identifiable refrains from some of "The Moodies" greatest songs interspersed with the melodic instrumentals and vocals from the other artists encountered on this CD. Undoubtedly, you will find yourself turning once again to your Moodies CD catalog for a full-fledged trip through their consistent harmonic excellence.	Finally, when you hear the Moodies (led by Hayward) on their latest vocal effort (the last cut on the "Journey"CD) "We Can Fly", you'll agree that it is the melody that makes for music that endures. This soundtrack CD strongly brings that message home.
0,I REALLY miss the old "CD-NOW" site (bought out years ago by Amazon) that had complete session information including musicians lists, etc.		Why did they remove that priceless wealth of information?
0,great 1st album from a fantastic band
0,You might notice that I've gone and reviewed this album twice.  Why?  Well, the first time I did so was when this album was out of print, and CD copies were selling on ebay for anywhere from $50-$100 (no joke), and therefore you really had to think twice about buying it.  I'm one of the more devoted Gun Club fans you will probably ever encounter, and even I didn't buy the cd at that price.  However, since the album has now been reissued, there's really no reason not to get it.		The Gun Club were somehow always identified as a punk rock band.  Maybe its because of the time and place of their inception (los angeles in the early 80s), or maybe it was because of who they hung out with (Debbie Harry, Nick Cave and the Cramps are always mentioned in the same breath as them).  Whatever the case, this album really illustrates how that term was inadequate to describe the band.		Sure, there are a few tracks that have the requisite jagged guitar playing and 4/4 drumming to qualify, but there's so much more here than that.  It explores various different strains of American roots music, with a particular emphasis on country via the use of pedal steel guitar, and treats each with the same stripped down, back-to-basics approach.  Its a demonstration that you can make very complex and compelling music without having 10 minute long, virtuosic solos or recording studios that look like they were designed by NASA.  I suppose that sort of mentality about music is at the core of what punk rock is about, but there's probably more people out there who hear the term punk and automatically think mohawks and leather than there are who hear it and think of stuff like this.		The album starts off with "Carry Home", a rolling, dirty garage song that changes tempo suddenly and wouldn't sound out of place on the Nuggets box set.  It goes from there through a sort of review of the aforementioned roots thing, and on to some weird tribal psychedelia ("Watermelon Man"), some traditional punk ("Bad Indian", "Sleeping in Blood City", etc), and then back to the roots thing with "John Hardy" and "Mother of Earth".  The sound throughout is tinny and almost ghostly, as if it were recorded in the period it continually references.  Throughout it all, Jeffrey Lee Pierce demonstrated his uncanny knack for conjuring up vivid imagery with the simplest language.  He was one of the few rock songwriters capable of writing in a style that had attitude and sex appeal without sacrificing any emotional depth.		I'd hate to say something as trite as, "well if you like the White Stripes, you'll love this!", but I'm sure you'll hear echos of that same sort of vibe in the Gun Club's music.  I'm not trying to put down anyone like that either, but there's something about the Gun Club, and this album in particular, that makes the most recent wave of garage-inspired hit-makers seem somewhat uninspired.		In other words, for less than $15, this album won't do you wrong.  Unless you are the sort of rock fan who listens exclusively to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the usual staples of classic rock radio, I think you will like this album.		EDIT (6/11/06):  I think the cover of Miami is one of the coolest album covers ever, if you feel similarly, check out the cover of the Twilight Singers' album "Blackberry Belle".
0,This is great cocktail party music.  I don't know what it is about it, but it just reminds me of martinis and cosmopolitans.  I just love this soundtrack.  Every track is unique and zippy with lots of flair with probably the exception being the "Drip Dry Waltz" which wasn't one of my favorite parts of the movie either.		Latin Snowfall is particularly appealing to me and be sure to go back and watch the scene of Audrey Hepburn skiing in France to enjoy the track along with the movie.
0,Every now and then a new artist comes along who seems destined to become a  classic - someone we will remember long after the last note fades  away.	Rene Marie seems to be just that kind of artist - someone who sings  as though every note breathes and moves and sways with new life,  re-defining the meaning of the word "singer".	Aside from the  richness of her voice, one of the things that sets this disk apart from the  usual "female jazz singer" fare is the choice of songs offered up  on this CD.  By taking Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart's classic country song  "Tennessee Waltz" and re-inventing it as as a blusey soulful  ballad, Marie stretches the idea of "Jazz as Improvisation" to  the max.  She also proves herself as a songwriter as well by writing or  co-writing three songs on the CD that stand up as well as other classics on  the disk such as "What a Difference a Day Makes" and "God  Bless the Child".  One stand out is the soft romanticism of "Take  My Breath Away", which Marie co-wrote with Bob Hallahan.	The disk  ends on a joyful note with a Jamacian inspired version of "How Can I  Keep From Singing" that leaves you wanting more and wishing the disk  was twice as long.	The CD's liner note says that her name means  "re-born" and she breathes new life into the meaning of the word  Jazz.  This is a disk that will be enjoyed by all who love music.
0,This is a 4CD set of Art Farmer and The Jazztet albums. I only have one album already, Meet The Jazztet, a classic.

0,I've listened to this every since i was little. this CD is perfect for me, Ozzy is my favorite artist of all time.
0,"Who Needs Guitars Anyways?," the debut album by Dutch DJ Judy, along with famed producers Pronti & Kalmani and Danski & Delmundo (of the Vengaboys), brings forth the emergence of the "mixing House beats with a little Trance and Europop" craze. This album may not be very flexible (most European dance music sounds very much the same) since it recycles the same drum loops and has very predictable melodies, but Alice Deejay's music is technical enough and playful enough to have your feet stomping to the music. Judy does not have the greatest of vocals, but then again, it's not really the singer you should be listening to anyways, thanks to the amazing instrumentals.	Songs such as "Better Off Alone," "Back in My Life," and "Will I Ever" have all become established international club hits. A couple million people dancing to the same beat couldn't be too wrong, now could they? "Better Off Alone" as a matter of fact skyrocketed to #1 on the dance charts in at least 5 different countries, making it one of the greatest singles of 1999-2000. Asides from the three chart-toppers, you have some other mentionable songs such as the title track, "Who Needs Guitars Anyways?"	Hopefully Alice Deejay will continue bringing forth solid albums with even more club anthems. Judy is bound to become one of the great figureheads of club culture.	So in conclusion, buy this album if you're looking for something fun, something exciting, or something great to play at parties. Don't buy this album if you are looking for the finer things in music, such as complex rhythms, basslines, or melodies (in which case you should try searching for the REAL House-Trance crossovers. i.e. Mauro Picotto)	- the enlightened one

0,With 1985's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Spleen-and-Ideal/dp/B000002MPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Spleen and Ideal</a>&nbsp;and 1987's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Within-the-Realm-of-a-Dying-Sun/dp/B000002MQ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Within the Realm of a Dying Sun</a>, Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, from beginnings in gothic postpunk, created a sound so different that it is a wonder they began where they did. Utilising simple, exceedingly slow, but funky beats and instrumentation closer to classical music than rock they created two albums with a deep darkness that made even the heaviest black metal sound completely shallow. Lisa Gerrard's glossolalic vocals might have captured the attention, but Perry's big, yet never pompous voice was equally good.		On "The Serpent's Egg", Dead Can Dance maintain the same basic formula of their two previous masterpieces, but become of anything even more abstract and inaccessible, with the dense rhythms disappearing in favour of a more melodic instrumentation. This is seen on the powerful, epic organ-based opener "The Host of Seraphim", commonly cited as the band's defining moment and a wondrous piece of work even if a little too long. Second track "Orbis de Ignis" shows further the changes: at times Lisa Gerrard sounds a little like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Anne-Briggs/dp/B00000J80K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anne Briggs</a>, and on the harpsichord-drive "The Writing on My Father's Hand" she takes this traditional folk influence even deeper: the single-note rhythm mixes the sound of a harpsichord and a guitar with perfect ease.		The rhythmic beats the band was to use before and after are still seen on "Echolalia", which, however, must rank as almost the best song here with Lisa's amazing, passionate vocal that beats&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Le-Mystre-des-Voix-Bulgares/dp/B000005J3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Le Mystre des Voix Bulgares</a>&nbsp;at its own game. "Mother Tongue" is extremely danceable but, unlike the disappointing work they did later, truly entrancing and wonderfully simple. "Chant of the Paladin", however, is the one disappointment here, being a representation of where Dead Can Dance would go in the 1990s. The warm, soothing "Song of Sophia" is however truly prayerful in tone and lisa sounds right on form.		However, on "The Serpent's Egg" it is the Brendan Perry vocals that provide the true highlights with three brilliant songs. The organ-based ballad "Severance", which can move any listener to tears, makes so many pop singers look like fools with pompous arrangements and is about the easiest listen for a neophyte in the Dead Can Dance canon, being quite catchy in its slow chorus. "In the Kingdom of the Blind the One-Eyed Are Kings" is a remarkably simple folk ballad made up of alternating piano and harpsichord notes and Perry's soulful voice given so much space it expresses emotions conveying the deepest fear imaginable when Brendan sings "chaos in motion". Closer "Ulysses" is the closest song to their previous two albums, but its twinkling harpsichord provides an amazing complement for Perry taking on a different tone amidst beautiful backing from Lisa and simple strings. then, some more typical vocals from Brendan take the song up to a level few have ever matched. The lyrics express the tone of the music's sadness as well as they could: even when Perryis depairing, he does not rant and indeed sounds as warm as Lisa normall would.		All in all, apart from one misstep, "The Serpent's Egg" stands as the last of a masterful trio of albums by one of the most unique duos in late twentieth-century music.
0,If Pink Floyd had become a Christian screamo band, they would probably sound a lot like mewithoutyou. Probably the only straight up jam sessions of old you will hear in the current emo/hardcore scene. Beautiful lyrics, instrumentals that will blow your mind, overall just a masterpiece with wisdom and ability far beyond the age of it's members.
0,I bought the CD and the DVD and love them both.  What a blessing these are to me and my family.  I listen to the CD over and over and have shared the DVD with friends.  Can't wait to watch it again.  These two quartets are incredible by themselves, but together they are are amazing and a real blessing, too! Everyone must have them both if you are fans of the Gaither's and Ernie Haas.
0,The stories are many and revealing. Slash from G'N'R chased a girl for months then forgot all about her after hearing it. Kurt Cobain said this was the kind of album he listened to as a child: the kind that delivers one great song after another, relentlessly. Without hyperbole, Rocks is simply one of the best hard rock albums ever laid down. Albums have a five star average rating here on Amazon for a good reason.	After organizing and fermenting their sound and phenomenal songwriting talents on 'Get Your Wings' and showcasing just how consistent and compelling they could be with 'Toys in the Attic', 'Rocks' saw Aerosmith reach the peak of their powers, a watershed recording that has been a benchmark for the genre ever since, which also sadly heralded the onset of a creative decline for the band. 'Rocks' is everything one could ever need, or expect from such a band. The most special thing about the album is its undeniablly startling consistency of quality, and the underlying suspicion in ones brain that this is perfection of some sort: sure, it a grimy, sleazy, good time chasing, Aerosmith to the core kind of perfection, but perfection nonetheless.	With a fountain of praise like that, I almost feel an in depth analysis is redundant here, so a brief overview will hopefully suffice. 'Back in the Saddle' is the ultimate statement of intent, a rolling cowboy song with a memorable riff. Hands down, one of the best openers ever. The stunning thing is the band's effortless progression into the walking funk of 'Last Child', then quickly into the driving,all out storm that is 'Rats in the Cellar'. Classic cuts like 'Sick as a Dog', all gorgeous melodies and gritty lyrics working to repel each other, as well as 'Lick and A promise', 'Get the lead out' and the dark, monstrous 'Nobodys fault' round out the album. The band even sounds confident going into Tyler's now obligatory closing ballad 'Home Tonight', a beautiful heartfelt number which puts any recent commercial offerings so badly to shame one feels close to tears.	'Rocks'is one of the most influential, revered and memorable rock albums of all time. Then near total critical and fan consensus on its charms only serves to draw a line under its signature of quality.	I urge anyone with any kind of interest in this music at all to buy this now. Right now.	'Rocks' is the pinnacle of hard rock.
0,I was very surprised by this reissue. Surprised that the original US release's sequencing is if far superior to it's English counterpart.		Pure Pop for Now People is perhaps the finest pop album ever crafted. Perhaps one of the 100 greatest albums ever made. As it's out of print, this is a must buy. The sound quality is fantastic and the packaging and notes great .		The extras are ok...perhaps Cruel to be Kind the best but I do feel the CD is missing some of the more obscure and interesting of Lowe's work of the period.		It's a must buy but may I suggest burning a CD in the original US sequencing of  just the original 12 songs to hear what a perfect pop gem Pure Pop for Now People actually was?
0,Excellent even for someone who already had copies of their earlier music.
0,This is great for parties or for people who just want to get in the frame of mind of partying.
0,I have been a KoRn fan since the same sounding songs of the first album.  I became a devoted fan when Life Is Peachy, a more progressive and aggressive album, came out(their best since Issues).  I am even a fan of  their lame album Freak On A Leash.  However my hopes for one of my favorite  ROCK bands was very little for Issues, I just recently picked it up(and yes  I was that put off by the music of FOAL).	To my surprise, Issues has  tremendous SONGS---Beg For Me, Trash, Somebody Someone, et al.  This record  is a statement of further progression from a band that has transcended its  sameness that made the debut and FOAL numbing.  So the SONGS on Issues do  not have shredding guitar solos, multi-key musical movements, a  perfect-pitch singer, ad naseum(leave that stuff to Dream Theater) that  does not mean that this album is not great.	But the SONGS make an  impact using guitar atomospherics, vocal effects, thick sounding bass and  guitars, enlivened production, and their signature minimalist SONG  structures.	KoRn has built on the minimalism of the first album, the  variety of LIP, and the identifiable layered choruses of their last album  to produce their best album yet.	KoRn's Issues is stellar.  Rock on.
0,I miss the old I Mother Earth. Although you can hear a great effort on this disc. Love that this band is still making good music!
0,The atmospheric sound of this classic album is made up of only voice, guitar and harmonica. The stories are told in compelling imagery over stately melodies. Although the sentiment is deeply melancholic, the promise of redemption is never entirely absent. Places like Lincoln, Atlantic City, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, Johnstown, Wyoming and Linden Town provide the setting for these tales of nostalgia, trouble and heartbreak.		If you've seen the 1973 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Badlands/dp/0790739240/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Badlands</a>&nbsp;(Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen) you'll have a more profound understanding of the title track. Both it and Mansion on the Hill are slow and mournful whilst Atlantic City has a lilting beat and Johnny 99 is edgy with its nervous guitar riffs that also infuse State Trooper, a song that thematically relates to Highway Patrolman.		Springsteen's characteristic car and road imagery surfaces in Used Cars with its poignant childhood recollections as well as in Open All Night, an uptempo rock song, the only one on the album. The line "radios jammed up with gospel stations, lost souls callin' lost distance salvation" reminds me of Far Away Eyes by the Stones, a tongue-in-cheek country song on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Some-Girls/dp/B000007SL7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Some Girls</a>. For some reason, it also makes me think of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hank-Williams/dp/0143037714/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hank Williams</a>.		Guilt, remorse and the yearning for redemption are expressed in vivid oneiric imagery on the haunting track My Father's House. Reason to Believe concludes this outstanding album on an uplifting note with the observation that people ultimately do find meaning. It echoes a similar hope earlier expressed in Atlantic City, the notion that perhaps everything that dies someday comes back. Its simplicity, profundity and power make Nebraska a masterpiece and a highly influential work.
0,Ive been telling people for years that Barry Manilow is one of the most underrated musicians of all time. In addition to being a terrific vocalist and a consummate showman, Manilow is a top-rate lyricist, composer, producer, and musician. His new album, Night Songs, puts Manilows talents on full display in this stripped-down jazzy affair where hes featured on vocals, piano and bass.		If you enjoyed Manilows 1984 concept album 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe, you will love Night Songs. Manilow breathes life into 16 lesser-known standards to create a beautiful collection of music that will please both hardcore and casual fans. Its the perfect album to play if you're looking to relax after a long day at work or if you're trying to set the mood for a romantic evening at home. Whether you're a Barry Manilow fan or just someone who enjoys sophisticated and sexy music, you owe it to yourself to pick up Night Songs.		Below is a track-by-track review of the album:		I Fall In Love Too Easily		This 1944 song by legendary lyricist Sammy Cahn has never sounded better. Its the perfect song to kick off the album because it embodies the spirit of Night Songs and sets the tone for the album. The vocal on this track is heartfelt and full of emotion without being over the top, and the piano and bass are beautiful.		Alone Together		Alone Together is a jazz standard composed by Arthur Schwartz with lyrics by Howard Dietz. It was first introduced to the public in the 1932 musical Flying Colors and became a hit the same year for Leo Reisman and his orchestra. Prior to this album, I never heard this song but Im glad it was included. It has an interesting chord progression, a jazzy bridge and a funky bass that keeps things lively.		Blame It On My Youth		This beautiful little song written by Oscar Levant and Edward Heyman in 1934 is perfect for Manilows voice and conjures up memories of his tribute album to Frank Sinatra: Manilow Sings Sinatra. This isn't surprising because Sinatra covered this song on his 1957 album Close To You. Its easily one of my favorite tracks on the album.		I Get Along Without You Very Well		Composed by Hoagy Carmichael in 1939, this song features lyrics based on a poem written by Jane Brown Thompson. Its a beautifully sad song about a relationship that has come to an end and the denial associated with it. Think of it as a combination of the John Waite song Missing You and Robert Goulets If Ever I Would Leave You from the musical Camelot  only much prettier. Manilows emotive vocal on this number is perfect for the subject matter and the piano is gorgeous.		Youre Getting To Be A Habit With Me		Youre Getting To Be A Habit With Me is a wonderfully jazzy song with an infectious melody that will have you playing it over and over again. This song originally appeared in the film version of the musical 42nd Street, and its abundantly clear that Manilow loves this number because it comes through in his fun, upbeat vocal.		It Amazes Me		This song is the title track of Liza Minnellis second studio album, and its a poignant track about being loved. Manilows vocals are spot on and sincere. Hopefully this moving rendition with help this song get the attention it deserved when it was first released in 1965.		But Not For Me		Similar to Youre Getting To Be A Habit With Me, this is a lovely upbeat number that provides a nice break in between the more serious songs. Its been sung by everyone from Judy Garland to Rod Stewart, yet Manilows version still comes off as fun and fresh.		Its A New World		Judy Garland is one of Manilows greatest influences so its not surprising that he included a song she sang in the 1954 musical film A Star Is Born. Its a gorgeous piano-driven number that Manilow delivers with style and grace. Judy would be proud.		While Were Young		This pleasant mid-tempo ballad from the 1940s was previously sung by artists including Peggy Lee and Perry Como. Manilow delivers a strong vocal on this track and makes it his own.		You Dont Know What Love Is		First made popular by Broadway star Carol Bruce, You Dont Know What Love Is has been covered by various artists since its inception in 1941, and it appeared on the soundtrack for the 1999 film The Talented Mr. Ripley. Like many songs from this era, its short yet substantive  and Manilows sultry rendition is spellbinding.		Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive		On 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe Manilow put music to an unreleased Johnny Mercer song: When October Goes. Therefore, its not surprising that Manilow should pay tribute to Mercer by singing Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive on this album. This is arguably the most upbeat number on Night Songs and Manilow clearly had a great time recording it. Between the jazzy piano and the infectious melody, this is one track youll have a hard time getting out of your head.		My One And Only Love		This song first made popular by Frank Sinatra in 1953 is deftly sung and played by Manilow. The bridge is lovely and the vocal is hauntingly beautiful. Simply stated: its gorgeous.		Ive Never Been In Love Before		From the 1950 musical Guys and Dolls, this song features a high-energy performance from Manilow. Not only does hes joyfully play the piano and deliver a swing-infused vocal, the listener is also treated to some great scat singing.		I Walk A Little Faster		This obscure standard written by Cy Coleman was most notably sung by Fiona Apple in 2009, and its clever lyrics tell the story of a person who is hopeful that true love is just around the corner. It has a unique melody and a chorus that builds in a fascinating way. As will all the tracks on this album, Manilows performance is solid and sincere.		Heres That Rainy Day		First introduced in the 1953 musical Carnival in Flanders, this song was composed by Jimmy Van Heusen and it features lyrics by Johnny Burke. Frank Sinatra recorded it in 1959 and it hasn't received much attention since then. While somber, Manilows delivery drives home the meaning of the song and forces the listener to appreciate its wonderful lyrics.		Some Other Time		Night Songs comes to a close with a Leonard Bernstein song from the 1944 Broadway musical On the Town. As the song states: Just when the fun is starting, comes the time for parting. But lets just be glad for what weve had and whats to come. Lets indeed. I couldn't think of a better way to end a great album.
0,I like fall out boy but the sound quality of this disc is only decent....
0,This CD is Seal at his best.  I have my favorite songs of course, but this is one CD that I listen to straight through without skipping around songs!
0,I have to admit, it took a few listens for this recording to completely satisfy me, but now I love it. Chloe's vocals are less calculated than what we have heard with Celtic Woman; but that's OK. I can picture an Irish kid singing to herself as she goes about her day. She comes to us not so much as a performer, but as a person.
0,This "40th Anniversary Tour box" is a collector's item packed in a DVD case with a nice DVD sized booklet and an audio CD with interviews and a couple sample selections from the King Crimson Collectors Club releases.		The only unique material in this tour box is the interviews and the booklet.		I bought mine at the NYC Nokia King Crimson shows in 2009 and this was the multimedia "program" for the very limited 40th Anniversary tour with Tony Levin.
0,Just a quick note... Danny Boyle's film "Trance" is a masterpiece with the kind of soundtrack that makes you want to buy the OST immediately (and now of course you can) But then you download the OST and when you listen to it you want to watch the film again... And so on and so on... Last time this happened for me was with David Lynch's "Lost Highway" and the OST put together by Trent Reznor... You almost want to watch the film with the sound off and just blast the OST... Could work...		Here is the track listing as it appears in the film (to the best of my ability, feedback appreciated): 10.15.7.5.13.1.2.6.8.9.14.12.3.11.4.16 (And several songs were reprised throughout)		(Here It Comes instrumental)	Hold My Hand - UNKLE	The Heist - Rick Smith	Raw Umber - Rick Smith	(Here It Comes instrumental)	Cannon Fall - Rick Smith	Soho Dim Sum - Rick Smith	(Cannon Fall reprise)	Chanson D'Amour - Art and Dotty Todd	Bullet Cut - Rick Smith	(Raw Umber reprise)	Sandman - Kirsty McGee	(Here It Comes instrumental)	The Day - Moby	Santiago (101 Greatest Goals) - Rick Smith	You Knew - Rick Smith	Movin' On Up - M People	Solomon - Rick Smith	Bring It To Me - Rick Smith	Here It Comes - Emeli Sande	(Raw Umber reprise)	Sandman (I'll Be There) - Rosario Dawson
0,Every BT album is carefully crafted with outstanding production values and excellent compositions.  This album is no different, plus it is recorded as a continuous DJ mix, making it a great driving or partying album!
0,I've been haunted by this album and love it. Blu Girl is by far, the best song in this album!
0,This is a tame release compared to Milliontown.  It is still great but the Milliontown track and Blacklight spoiled me.  There's a section where the guitars are straight Joe Satriani.  (possibly Eventide and Boss don't really know but it's Joe inspired for sure).  Lots of instrumental awesomeness and I feel that after a few more listenings I'll be sold....but the later didn't need such accommodations.  The mix is all over the place, sometimes really quiet then boom, turn the stereo down.  This is more of a headphone fest than a car stereo release.  Atmospheric sounds, keyboards and killer guitar.  The lyrics are awesome as usual.  A great follow up to Milliontown, but still a follow up never the less.  I highly recommend this album if you are a pure Prog Rock fan.
0,Sarah Brightman proves once again that she is a great singer. This follow-up Cd from Time to say Good-bye will not show her power as a singer though. This Album will be more of a Cd you could listen to, to relax and  lift your spirts. Her read on My heart will go on surpasses that of Celine  Dion. Nessun Dorma was amazingly done ( this was the first time I heard a  soprano sing this tenor aria) and well as Track 6 and 3. This CD exceeding  all my expectations and will make you looking forward to Sarah's New CD  Luna.  With her beautiful voice and constant training she will be able to  surpass all the opera critics. This Cd is a must buy for all those that  think that Church ( the 16 year old ) can be compared to Sarah Brightman to  prove themselves wrong. I don't think there will ever be a singer that will  be able to acomplish what Sarah Brightman has....vocal power...vocal  verastility....and yet have the voice of an angel..not even Callas was able  to achive that.
0,Fall Out Boy is often written off by many music "critics" and even fans who call their music "emo".  Whatever. I don't care what you call it, but compared to many other "bands" of today, FOB manages to make some pretty great music, all the while switching up their sound and keeping things fresh.  I actually purchased Infinity On High and Folie before I picked up Take This To Your Grave.  Naturally it wasn't the sound I was expecting to hear after listening to the aforementioned albums on repeat.  Although I was surprised, it was in a good way, and I was really impressed by how much more "punky" this album sounded.  I even liken it to some of Blink 182's earlier albums.  If you are hung up on Fall Out Boy's over-played radio songs like "Sugar We're Goin Down" and "Dance Dance" you owe it to yourself to give their full albums a try.  The music you don't hear on the radio isn't played on the radio for a reason...it isn't radio-friendly poppy nonsense.  Although FOB makes plenty of songs to appeal to the masses, there are some hidden gems on here that any rock fan can appreciate.		Give this album a shot, you might be surprised by what you hear.
0,well satisfied
0,This is yet another cracking disc from Jordi Savall.  It is a collection of vocal and instrumental pieces from the first half of the 16th Century, based loosely around the chanson Mille Regretz.  There are some familiar composers here, like Josquin, Morales, Willert and others and also some more obscure pieces including a number of anonymous ones.  It's a terrific programme, put together with Savall's unfailing scholarship and musical judgement.		The performances are, as you'd expect, terrific.  The overall sound is lovely, the individual singers and players are excellent and the arrangements are impeccable; the judgement of the use of percussion is excellent, for example.  It's a fabulous disc.		I've loved Savall's work for many years now, and this is among his best, I think.  The recorded sound, presentation and notes are all up to Alia Vox's usual excellent standard and it's a really good disc all round.  I can recommend this very warmly indeed.
0,Ok, so I'm late to the party on this, but I finally sat down and listened to Taylor Swift's monumentally successful fifth record, "1989," after being inundated with its diarrhea-like flow of hit singles over the last year. Despite the over-saturation of songs like "Shake It Off" and "Blank Space," Swift's newly crafted pop sound remained incredibly appealing, possessing a precision and intelligence not found in works by her peers. I've been a fan of Swift since her first record, and she has steadily matured with each passing release, and "1989" is her most focused and consistent work to date.		The most comparable record I can think of is Bruce Springsteen's 1984 classic "Born in the U.S.A.," which showcased a significant shift towards a more poppy sound for the artist and contained a frighteningly high amount of hit singles for a single record; also, both records catapulted the artists from 'famous' to 'phenomenon' (partially on the strength of equally huge tours in support of the album). Like The Boss, Taylor doesn't sacrifice meaning for meter; hidden beneath the catchy melodies and singalong chorus are surprisingly thoughtful lyrics; while some have accused Swift of writing trivial songs about relationships, "1989" has her handling this type of the material with the utmost sophistication, whether it's the 'do or die' motif of "Blank Space" or the longing of "Wildest Dreams." Gone are the fantasized flings of "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me," we are getting real depth here.		"1989" is brilliant, edgy, fun, intelligent pop music, and will rightfully go down as a classic in the coming years.
0,1984, the Orwellian Year, had INXS releasing their fourth album, The Swing.  This was the first album recorded outside of Australia.  Nile Rodgers, long time producer and owner of Power Station Studio, took these young fledglings and managed to garner the ear of the Land of Plenty - America.		Original Sin, released in the last month of '83, perked the ears of the world.  With New Wave coming into it's own and Alternative Rock now a viable subcategory of rock, INXS had found their niche.  The Swing made it to 52 in the Top 200.  Certainly no runaway hit, people were listening.		INXS also tweaked their sound a bit to add music to which people could easily dance.  Europe, long with their tradition of discothques (and I don't mean that crappy 70s-80s disco sound, but a place in which to dance) embraced INXS' Original Sin and other tracks from the album.
0,I have been a fan of Bonnie Raitt's since the 70's.  Her husky voice is the original female bluesy instrument, emulated by so many on American Idol, and what a fabulous blues and rock guitarist.  She has always been a true professional, a perfectionist in fact, as well as an activist.  I have seen her live on many occasions at various benefit & "save the environment" & Honor the Earth concerts.  I already own most of her output, so was hesitant to buy another, but then amazon mp3 had it for 3.99.  Wow!  She has done it again.  This is one of her best albums ever, definitely worth adding to your collection. The production is impecable and crisp, the tunes (many are covers) are catchy, bluesy, rock 'n roll --  altogether  a winner. If you're not familiar with Bonnie Raitt, then do yourself a favor and do so!
0,The often revelatory approach that Jacobs brings to his interpretations of the Mozart operas is not so obvious in this recording. I think Jacobs greatest skill is bringing out the personal and intimate. He sees the humour and drama in unexpected places. This is harder to bring off in such a monumental and 'public' work as Idomeneo. Consequently, through his choices in direction and of singers he presents a slightly more inward looking and comfy interpretation.	Richard Croft exemplifies this approach. It is a smaller, sweet voice and used most intelligently. While this means the public declamations lack some impact the internal anguish is portrayed most effectively. You could swear at times that Sunhae Im is Kathleen Battle with a heart and Kenneth Tarver sings so well that Arbace's arias will actually sound like they deserve to be in the opera. Pendatchanska is real firecracker as Elettra, quite unhinged. The real star of the opera is the Freiburger Baraockorchester who have a remarkable sense of ensemble and wind playing of real beauty.	If you own the intense, searing recording of Gardiner the good thing is that Jacob's approach is so different you can justify owning another set. Which you prefer will depend on your personality. It is also good to have the making of DVD as a bonus which was most illuminating.
0,This is fine example of polished rockabilly from the 50's! Janis Martin rocks with Nashville session players like Chet Atkins (on guitar), Floyd Cramer (on Piano), Grady Martin (on guitar), Murray Harman, Jr. (drums), Bob Moore (bass),... Same musicians who were playing for Elvis. Sessions were produced by Steve Sholes, who was Elvis' producer too. Good rockabilly and nice country ballads!
0,20/20 were one of those millions of pop bands that was springing up around the same time as Motels, Plimsouls, The Knack and the whole high-energy scene. This two-fer finally re-invites the folks who didn't get the Oglio version a few years back (and was fetching outrageous prices) to hear one of the best of the Los Angeles bands from that era all over again. Adding a pair of B-Sides from the "Look Out" period, and this is essentially every song 20/20 released during their tenure on Portrait/Epic records.		The calling card of their first album remains the nervous wind-up of "Yellow Pills," which picked up plenty of airplay on Alternative Rockers like KROQ and still makes Power Pop compilations today. Ron Flynt and Steve Allen were Tulsa transplants that had worked themselves into a formidable songwriting team, which leaves such undiscovered gems like "Ride The Lightning" or "Cheri" overshadowed by the more famous songs. But 20/20 had the same worldview as fellow Okies Dwight Twilley and Phil Seymour in that a Midwestern sound filled with energy and a love of British pop could carry a good song a long distance. Add a new-wave synth or two and you were getting some power-pop brilliance.		According to the liner notes, "20/20" was recorded in a matter of weeks. The followup, "Look Out," took over a year. It also marked some changes for the band, with original drummer Mike Gallo out and Joel Turrisi in, the sound was also shifting. The energy was still there but a more American outlook was entering. The harmonies were even tighter and the lyrical content was taking on a darker tone. I was fortunate enough to interview Steve Allen when the album was released and he pointed out that the death of John Lennon and world turmoil informed the mood of the album.		Produced by Richard Polodor (who was helming some great bands in this period), there was no mistaking that the band had tightened up. "Nuclear Boy" and "Beat City" were vibrant looks at the world, while "Mobile Unit 245" and "The Night I Heard a Scream" looked towards life's tragic moments. While the nervous energy that fueled the first album was tempered, the songs were way more gripping and (like "American Dream") more experimental. They'd matured rapidly into their power-pop shoes. I still think it's a better album than the debut, though there are some who will disagree.		Together, however, "20/20-Look Out" would please any fan of Shoes, Motels, Plimsouls and bands of their ilk. From the label Real Gone Music, who recently issued the Shoes anthology, these guys took care to master the disc well and get liner notes from Steve Allen, Ron Flynt and Chris Silagyi, along with some cool blast from the past artwork and pictures. Now if only The Producers' two Portrait albums could get the same treatment, I'd be in Power Pop heaven.
0,Well, he finally did it.  Michael W. Smith's first worship album.  And, not even surprisingly, it's THE best collection of praise and worship songs I have ever heard.  Every single offering on this album is absolutely beautiful.  The first time I heard the opening track, it stirred my blood and sent a shiver up my spine, and the only reason I wasn't clapping along with the crowd on the CD was because I was driving at the time.  Michael's ability to take an already great worship song and turn it into a masterpiece is unparalleled.  I only wish I could have been in the chapel at Carpenter's Home when this blessed event took place.  His amazing piano is joined by a wonderful band and a choir that reads like a Christian music All-Star roster; Amy Grant, Phillips, Craig, and Dean, Chris Rice, Out of Eden, members of Plus One, Cindy Morgan, and many others all contribute to this powerful experience.  A few of the songs on this CD aren't very well-known, but by the end they'll be forever etched on your memory, thanks to this ensemble.  "Unforgettable" is an understatement.  You'll be inspired, lifted up, brought to your knees, and shaken to your foundation, all in one hour.  When I heard the chorus for "Let It Rain", I cried for the first time in over ten years--it's that moving.  I could go on for days about this album, but the review has to end sometime.  Get this CD and listen for yourself...it could very well change your life.
0,The styles are varied in this wonderful show, but the quality always high, with renditions of familiar classics along with a few original songs, with some numbers that are truly thrilling, among them the opening song, a bluegrass flavored "It's a Time for Joy" with Karen Peck and New River, the Gaither Vocal Band with David Phelps doing an exquisite tenor solo on "The Christmas Song" (and Mark Lowry doing Johnny Mathis !), "Children Go Where I Send Thee" with The Bishops giving us harmonies from heaven, the country rockin' sound of "Go Tell" with The Martins, and best of all, "Mary, Did You Know ?" (music and lyrics by Mark Lowry and Buddy Green), sung by the Gaither Vocal Band featuring an emotionally stirring solo by Mark Lowry. The words, melody, and interpretation of this song  fills my eyes with tears when I hear it...the disc is worth it for this number alone.		The music is so inspired, I probably would have preferred less humor...one segment in particular isn't that funny and has a "secular entertainment" feel to it, but that is a minor quibble when compared to the overwhelming spirit of this disc, which I'll enjoy any time of the year, with the musicians and singers giving 100% of their talent, and moving one to praise and worship the Lord, in the true spirit of Christmas.		The show was filmed in the Alabama Theater, a lovely ornate theater in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2001, and total running time is 90 minutes.		The DVD extras include an interesting piece titled "Project Spotlight" with people like Joni Eareckson Tada, and subtitles are also available.		Track Listing:		1: Program Opening		2:"It's a Time For Joy", Karen Peck and New River		3: Comedy featuring Mark Lowry and Bill Gaither		4: "Listen to the Angels Sing", The Martins		5: "Angels We Have Heard on High", The Hayes Family		6: "Good News", The Hoppers		7: "White Christmas", Jake Hess		8: "The Friendly Beasts" (just one verse) Jeff and Sheri Easter, Charlotte Ritchie		9: "Sweet Baby Jesus", Jeff and Sheri Easter, Charlotte Ritchie		10: "The Christmas Song", Gaither Vocal Band		11: Comedy with Aaron Wilburn		12: "Children Go Where I Send Thee", The Bishops		13: "Winter Wonderland", Sam Levine on Saxophone		14: "Hope of the Ages", Tanya Goodman Sykes		15: "Merry Christmas, My Love", Allison Durham Speer		16: "Go Tell", The Martins		17: "I'll be Home for Christmas", The Florida Boys		18: "Glory to God", The Talley Trio		19: "Piper's Night Before Christmas" story by Mark Lowry		20: "Holy is Thy Name", Legacy Five		21: Narrative by Zig Ziglar		22: "Five Little Fingers", Stephen Hill		23: Narrative by Gloria Gaither		24: "Ordinary Baby", Amy Rouse		25: "Mary, Did You Know ?", Mark Lowry and the Gaither Vocal Band		26: "The King is Coming", Gaither Vocal Band
0,I purchased this CD prior to seeing the Lumineers live. This band is hands down great! The CD is perfect!
0,I heard the song Gotta Soul on the radio one day while driving from work and really enjoyed the music and the vocals.  Once I made it home I searched for the artist and album.  This album has a pleasing soulful sound.  The music is soothing.  The song selections have a strong salvation message as well as a message about the importance of living your life right.  The song "Love Jones"  made me think.  I had heard about "love jones" but not in relation to Jesus.  Honestly, I enjoyed the whole album.
0,Lagwagon's "Hoss" was probably the easiest album to like. All  the songs are catchy and melodic. The sound of the music is a little bit of  pop, a little bit of hardcore, and a whole lot of punk. The best songs on  "Hoss" are "Violins" and "Name Dropping", and  then of course there is "Bro Independent", my new favorite song.  Whether you like pop-punk or hardcore, you should still by this album.
0,Just pure
0,Great album...like it more and more everytime I listen to it.  The people ragging on it seriously have to be listening to it under water or something.
0,Clarence Carter is super bad musically.his voice ain't no joke. the music is Bar B-Que flavored for sure. Stroking alone is a gem.he will crack you up but also get your respect with his music ability.
0,Fred Hammond is back with his 4th album with his Detroit based ensemble Radical For Christ. Though this album is good it does not dethrone his history making last album "Pages Of Life." The album starts off good with the midtempo "I Want My Destiny", then it continues with the catchy "Let Me Praise You Now", after this it slows down to the first ballad "Give Me A Clean Heart", which is reminiscent of "Don't Pass Me By" from his last album with its slow almost meditative feel. Then the album goes live from Houston with the rousing worship song "Thank You Lord [For Being There For Me]", then it continues into the down home flavored "Jesus, Be A Fence", that Hammond sung on Carlton Pearson's newest album "Live At Asuza Part 3". Then back to the studio we go with "I Know It Was The Blood", Hammond's first radio single from the album, then the encouraging "I Press". Then the touching ballad "My Father Was/Is", a well written comparison about the abandonment of biological fathers and the adoption by the father, God, obviously taken from Hammond's life. Then the back to the studio with the sweet worship song "Our Father" and the blazin' "Willing To Follow You", rumored to be picked for the concept video. Back to Houston we go for the insightful "When We Praise" and yet another rousing worship song "You Are The Living Word", one of the best songs on the album, then to end we go back to the studio with the faith filled "Yes He Will". This album is really good, but it is no 'Pages Of Life'.
0,If there's a band you wanna listen to that's gonna take you back to the 90s these are the guys. Just the title is enough to tell you the lyrical content is great, and as for the songs it's all classics and not one stinker. Listen to this immediately
0,This album is worth the effort based on the Buck Owens duet, "Streets of Bakersfield".  Dwight singing with his idol is cool stuff.	I have always had an affinity for the sad country boy song, "I Sang Dixie".  Dwight's wailing vocals bring this song to it's saddest best.	Dwight Yoakam is a true original!
0,What I love about Frozen is that it's the first Disney movie in a long time to use memorable songs and storytelling to create something that millions are drawn to.		While the standard soundtrack is amazing in its own right, I'm glad I bought the deluxe version. In addition to a couple of demo versions, we are treated to a number of outtake songs that on their own are fun to listen to. Add on some score demos and karaoke versions for the movie's biggest tracks, and you have a soundtrack experience that adults and children can both enjoy.		I would recommend this to anyone who loved the movie/music and want even more of it!
0,A fantastic CD - I listen to it every time I get in my car!!! I did not have any KU music so this was a great selection!
0,I bought this CD for one song only.  Happily, I found I like all the songs on this CD.  Recommend you buy this CD.
0,Thank You:)
0,One of the few box sets to fully accomplish what box sets are expected to...	This Byrds box has almost every essential track the Byrds released in their career.	Also, there are numerous unreleased tracks that enhance  and add value to the box. Among them: the lost Gram Parsons vocals on  Sweetheart of the Rodeo, the alternate Oil In My Lamp from Ballad Of Easy  Rider, the live tracks recorded around the Untitled Sessions, etc.	One  can quibble with the song selection, but there are only a few glaring  omissions: King Apathy III, Gunga Din (can't figure that out, it is  considered a minor classic), and Set You Free This Time.	One note of  caution: Since the Byrds catalog has been remastered, one gets the  impression that these are supplanting the box. The tracks were remixed from  the multitracks creating a fresh stereo master whereas on the box the  original stereo 2-tracks were used (Eight Miles High on 5D now outclasses  the worn out version on the box). Stereo versions (It's All Over Now, Baby  Blue) replaced the mono versions that were used on the box. Tambourine Man  is now mixed in wide stereo finally, whereas on the box it is featured in  narrow stereo.	That is until we get to the Sweetheart of the Rodeo  outtakes. The Gram Parsons vocals are only found on the box.	In other  words, where fans want to upgrade the box through the catalog, you are  going to have to keep the box for only a half dozen songs. That is  unfortunate!	What should be done is to give the box a sonic facelift to  compete with the 20 bit mastering.	Oh...good news! The rest of their  catalog (Untitled, Byrdmaniax, Farther Along) will get the remastering  treatment early next year (around February).
0,BEEGIE ADAIR is a outstanding female! finest jazz piano who perform music.	She have a great impact with music loved in the jazz classical worlds.	It's always pleasure to listen BEEGIE ADAIR  jazz Piano Christmas for the Holiday.
0,I have had this for some time, but it is truly enjoyable, and like anything else by this artist.  He is a real talent and a true American treasure.  Definitely worth the purchase!
0,Terrific album
0,Beautiful music!  Great accompaniment to reading the books.
0,Just read what the other previous reviewers have to say, it is true!!!!!  I bought the CD and it is great, you will not regret buying it.
0,If you enjoy laid back music that is in my opinion folk/country, I recommend this album.  I will be listening to more WB and am refreshed amongst all the new age music.
0,THIS A GREAT INSTRUMENTAL ROCK ALBUM WITH THE 3 SANTANAS IN TOP FORM. EVERY SONG IS GREAT WITH EXCELLENT BLISTERING GUITAR SOLOS AND RYTHYMS IN THE TRADEMARK SANTANA STYLE.THERE REALLY ISN'T A BAD SONG ON THIS CD AND  IT'S NICE TO HEAR THE GUITARS SINGING INSTEAD OF VOICES. A MUST HAVE FOR  THE CARLOS SANTANA FANS.
0,"No Exit" is the follow-up album to The Angels (known as Angel City in the US) classic "Face To Face" album. You'll find the same energetic crowd favourites here as on FTF, but there's some songwriting growth on display with tracks like "Out Of The Blue" and "Dawn Is Breaking", which have quiet and sombre moments like "Outcast" on FTF. "Dawn Is Breaking" in particular is a lyrical masterpiece and ends with a quite unnerving whispered vocal by singer Doc Neeson. But then the drum intro to "Mr Damage" kicks in and we're back on familiar, rocking territory. This is a more concise record than its predecessor, with less filler and a darker edge. Given this trend it's not really surprising that their next album was entitled "Dark Room".		I confess that I've loved this album since it was released, but while other records from the time can be a little embarrassing now, this one still stands up as rock music of the highest order. The quality of the production really captures the energy & intensity of the band - although it's a little more polished than FTF. Rock music like this really is timeless, and provided the band is captured adequately in the first place, there's not much technology can add, save some sub-bass frequencies. Listen to some old Stooges or AC/DC...		Doc Neeson sings great on this and his lyrics are clever, thoughtful, and sometimes exceptional, especially in the slower/quiter tracks where he uses his expressive voice briliantly.		The guitars and rhythm section are fish-arse tight and devastatingly punchy. Rick Brewster plays some seering lead guitar which is never allowed to stray into guitar-hero noodling nor to dominate the song, and the guitar arrangements in general are superb. No coincidence that Harry Vanda and George Young (ex-Easybeats) get "production advice" credit here I think.		The Angels (along with AC/DC and Rose Tattoo) helped to create and define an era of Australian rock music. No Exit is an integral part of that era, and is arguably the middle part of a series of three albums which defined The Angels, and documented their growth for what was a remarkably short period of August 1978 to July 1980.		This is a great rock record with lots of energy, great songwriting and playing, but with a hint of a darker side just to mix things up a bit. If you can find it, buy it.		Steve
0,I found out about atreyu back when suicide notes was still trying, and from the beginning I was not a fan.  There sound was so generic, I had heard it a million times before in as many bands.  I thought at least they might get better as they go along, and much to my expectations not only did they get worse, they became a laughing stock, it really was a band that you either loved or hated, there absolutely was no inbetween.  After a while I discovered becoming the bull, and I almost *^%& myself when i heard it.  I loved it, with some research I found Lead Sails and three songs from that album became some of my all time favorite songs, Honor, Doomsday, Becoming the Bull.  Everything else on that album was in my opinion garbage.  Now that I was aware of this band again I did some more research and found the albums I missed, and guess what.....absolutely nothing else they had made sounded like those three songs, so again I passed them off.  Now fast forward to 2009 Congregation is released and I find out by accident looking for something else.  At first I'm like whatever, but i take a listen anyway and WOW this album is great.  There are more than a few tracks that could have been skipped, but the whole album just reinvented this band, I mean its like I completely don't give a crap about anything this band made before this album, the song writing is incredible, the riffs are heavy, the singing has improved ten-fold, this is truly the album Atreyu has been trying to make since Suicide Notes.  I only wish this really was there second album, cause I can't wait to see if they get even better than this from here.
0,By 1977 when this album was released, Kenny Loggins was hot property by dint of his songwriting/singing and production as part of Loggins and Messina. His songs had shown increasing sophistication and and even on the last of the duo's records 'Native Sons' (itself a disappointment) Loggin's had some outstanding contributions. As it was, 'Celebrate me Home' was a magnificent collection of songs in the AOR/West Coast genre. Produced by Bob James of jazz piano fame, it had a jazzy, soulful, AOR production. All the songs stand alone as strong compositions with strong themes and competent lyrics. The instrumentation is innovative and colourful, with mandolins and other exotic instruments lying on top of the jazz/soul groove. The female back up singing on 'f you be wise' ( a Jimmy Webb composition) is spine tinglingly evocative and some of Loggin's own compositions are quite outstanding (Enter my dream, I believe in Love). So if you're looking at 70s/80s West Coast music this is up there on the pinnacle. There's no country flavour at all (this was in the twilight of the heyday of country rock) and Loggin's folk music roots aren't apparent either but surely contribute to the backbone of the magnificent song writing. Essential.
0,I love this...it brings back so many good memories.
0,come on it's skynyrd
0,Epic level themes throughout. Rates at the top of my favorite adventure-level soundtrack compositions and orchestrations. Kudos to James Newton Howard for recognizing a far more powerful, emotional purpose to a tuba lead in the opener. Pity most composers have used the tuba only for comic relief - like emptying the "s***ter" in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.
0,If you feel like venting, this album is for you. This album is brilliant. It shows how the true 60's really was, not about peace, love, and the pursuit of happiness, but about a rejectful time filled with sin of drugs and hopelessness, young adults living as if they were in the barrio. Sunday Morning is a good start to that, better pray now. Waiting For My Man, pretty much to the point. Heroin, definitely to the point. There She Goes, good little number I think that speaks truth in such relationships. Angel of Black Death, doomy indeed. BEWARE, not for all all ears, very advant garde, definitely a good album to be mad with, and very poetic in the same.
0,I love Nicky Hopkins. He always does his best work playing off a great guitarist. So when Jerry Garcia and Nick Hopkins get together it's magical. See other Hopkins work ie rolling stones,Steve Miller band, volunteers-airplane,etc
0,By the time I bought this I already owned every other studio album they made except for Hatebreeder (which I plan on buying soon). I started out on Follow the Reaper a few years ago, and I was so addicted to that CD I'd play it for hours and hours every night. Then I bought Hate Crew Deathroll, Are You Dead Yet? (probably my least favorite of all their albums), and finally Tokyo Warhearts and Blooddrunk (both on the same day). A few weeks later I purchased Something Wild, and I have to be honest, I had mixed feelings about it at first, both good and bad. Don't get me wrong, I understand the fact that this was their debut and all, and it's a great album, but I couldn't help but feel that way at first.		First I'll start with the bad ones. The production quality is low, though it doesn't really matter to me since the musicianship makes up for it. Also, in all of COB's other albums Alexi's vocals are just kind of there to me. I don't like nor dislike them, I just pay more attention to the music itself. But in Something Wild there are some moments where his vocals don't exactly fit in. For the most part it's like any other album, but there's just those few little moments here and there where he seems to be trying a tad too hard, if that makes sense.		But putting that aside, the good things I thought about it, like I said is that the musicianship makes up for the low production quality. This is probably the most classical-influenced album that Bodom has put out to date. Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, you can even hear Mozart's Symphony No. 25 in the intro to "Red Light in My Eyes, Pt. 2." If you are more into Bodom's later work (Hatecrew Deathroll, Are You Dead Yet?, and Blooddrunk), this album may take some getting used to for you. But if you started out with Hatebreeder or Follow the Reaper then it may be more up your alley. Or if you've never heard of Children of Bodom period, these are some personal comparisons I've made between them and a more well-known band, Metallica:		- "Something Wild" is like their "Kill 'Em All."	- "Hatebreeder" is like their "Ride the Lightning"	- "Follow the Reaper" is like their "Master of Puppets/... And Justice For All."	- "Hatecrew Deathroll" is like their Black Album.	- "Are You Dead Yet?" (to me) is like their "Load/Reload," except not as bad, lol.	- "Blooddrunk" is like they skipped all the way to "Death Magnetic" and picked up from where they left off before AYDY, lol.		But overall, they have never made a bad album so far, some are just better than others. And Something Wild, though it may not be the best one to some, is still a great place to start if you're new to COB. I would highly recommend this, Hatebreeder, or Follow the Reaper first to any new fan.
0,Yeah!
0,Jesse Winchester's "A Reasonable Amount of Trouble" is essential listening for all of us touched by his music.  He is most often remembered as a songwriter; although I am always touched by the gentleness of his vocals.  There is a soul-felt friendliness that oozes through everything he sings that makes you feel like a good friend has given you a warm embrace.  This set is sadly our last musical hug from him, but all the more dear.  The opening track "All That We Have Is Now" is a breezy two-minute tune with his wisdom shining through, "Sunshine in the park, stories in the dark, laugh to hide the fear, cry a perfect tear cause all that we have is now."  Jesse Winchester covers "Rhythm of the Rain" that was a #3 hit for the Cascades in 1963.  In 1999 BMI listed the song as the ninth most performed song on radio/TV in the 20th century.  Gary Lewis & the Playboys had a minor hit with the song.  It must have been a favorite of Jesse's and shines with his tender vocals, "Rain please tell me does that seem fair for her to steal my heart away when she don't care?"  "Ghosts" has one of Winchester's classic melodies with a wistful bittersweet delivery whose gentleness is honey-sweet, "She is standing in the airport; She is telling me goodbye; She is telling me she loves me and there are teardrops in her eye."  "A Reasonable Amount of Trouble" is a sweet set, a fond farewell to a master musician.  Enjoy!
0,Another great set of rock n' roll cd's of the king. This set of cd's are very classic and it includes a great deal of his great hits. I recommend for any rock n' roll lover and especially Elvis. There will never be another like him.		R.Luis - Miami
0,"The Gold Medal Collection" is a loving tribute to the memory of Harry Chapin and not just a traditional Greathest Hits album.  You will find almost all of your favorite Harry Chapin songs included on this two-disc set--"Taxi," "Cat's in the Cradle," "A Better Place to Be," "W*O*L*D," "Mr. Tanner," "Corey's Coming," "The Rock"--along with Harry talking about Thanksgiving Hunger Drives, Commitment and Pete Seger, Calluses, Performing and his Grandfather, all of which serve to remind us of the man behind the music.  Before there was Bob Geldoff or Band-Aid, there was Harry Chapin raising money in his concerts for hunger relief.  In terms of what is new and different on this album, there are several live versions of songs, which serve to remind us how much Harry enjoyed playing for his audiences, and "Sniper" from his first album, which has yet to be released on CD.  The first disc ends with "There Only Was One Choice," his longest song from "Dance Band on the Titanic," which certainly takes on an added significance given the whole of Harry's life and the tragedy of his untimely death.  The collection ends with a poignant live version of his traditional encore piece, "Circle," with Harry promising to be out to talk to the fans and to see them again some time soon.  Even if you have the rest of Harry's albums, this one is still a most worthy addition to your collection.  If for some reason you do not own a Harry Chapin album, this is the one you want.  Then you will understand why we all miss him so much.
0,Steely Dan's radio broadcast. Sounds great.
0,GREAT ITEM
0,It's easy to forget how good this album is or take it for granted. When I first heard it in 1975, I was swept away with Bruce's cinematic approach and intensity. The Phil Spector-like production values and lyrical visions of tough luck kids on  fast cars or motorcycles wanting out of the dreary overcast Jersey landscape, looking across the river to New York, hoping for a better life is poignant. He captures the characters and the moods very well. This is a unifying theme thoughout most blue-collar neighborhoods in America. It was a very romantic view of young America with a mix of doo-wop, hustlers, rock and roll, and West Side Story images. This is without a doubt..ONE OF THE TEN BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME! Unfortunately, when you hit 75 home runs with a .450 average for one season, everyone expects the same again and again. In my estimation, I've always been waiting for another Born To Run, but that would be impossible. 1978's Darkness, was a shadow of that. 1984's Born In The USA came close.  It's the Orson Welles syndrome, after Citizen Kane...how can you top that! Well, if Bruce never recorded another note after Born to Run, he would have still made rock history. Every song is a Rolls Royce in production, melody and lyrical values. When you create a masterpiece...what can you do for an encore?
0,While 1985 seminal SCARECROW remains the signature John Mellencamp album, THE LONESOME JUBILEE, in my opinion, is his greatest musical achievement.  Both discs have a lot to say, lyrically speaking.  But whereas Scarecrow scored the messages with 60's-influenced rock, Jubilee expands this sound to include more rustic instrumentation.  The result is a pleasure to hear, as Mellencamp and his band effortlessly (or so it seems) make every song a keeper.  Even potentially heavy-handed material such as "We Are the People" and "Empty Hands" (with one of my favorite lines, "They say people get what they deserve/But Lord, sometimes it's much worse than that") is served up with such conviction that it's hard to fault their earnestness.		Unreleased material (the bonus track) is, of course, always welcome.  But as someone has already mentioned, it sure would have been nice to have the b-sides from Jubilee's singles on the disc.  Or even John's VERY SPECIAL CHRISTMAS contribution, "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus," which was released shortly after this album came out.		But I've still got my treasured 45's, so I can live with it.  In any event, if you only get one Mellencamp remastered disc, this is the one.
0,I stumbled across this band by accident. It was playing in the record store while I was hopelessly looking for something new to buy. Nothing was looking too appealing and the store did not have some of the lesser known groups I was looking for and then this album began playing. Within less than a minute I was at the counter asking the salesperson for a copy and 3 weeks later the CD still has not left my player even once! Every song is good. About the only thing I don't like is the fuzz guitar on Melatonin but that is such a minimal complaint its hardly even worth mentioning. I can only imagine how cool these songs sound in a live setting!
0,hammer smashed face along with couple of other cover songs the exorcist,and zero the hero.this is one my all time fave death metal songs and most people near me don't know metal like i do seen ace ventura my  brothers pals and me i said you know who that band is they were like no .i  said cannibal corpse they were like noway .they thought was cool.this is  the song that they were playing on that movie cool ay cannibal corpse are  so cool i really like them my all time fave death metal band and this song  is what got me into them not from  the movie but i heard them on radio and  said i have to get into these guys there great.this is a excellent cd for  the true cannibal corpse person i have all theirs except the new  bloodthirst album which i will get when i get the cash but if you are  serious bout cannibal as i am you will have to have this one in your  collection its for the serious corpse enthusaist like myself.please get  this .one its great..specially the covers the excorcist and zero the hero  they are awesome. also corpse fans look up six feet under too they are  excellent as well thanks ..and feel free to email me to talk to me anytime  i feel alone up here in northern ny with out any die hard metal fans like  myself i am surrounded by rap and country people who don't  have a clue as  to what underground metal or classic metal is .... bye for now
0,"YOU MAKE MY DREAMS" is the first hit off of this album by Daryl Hall and John Oates and promises great things to come for the duo. In my humble opinion, VOICES was the beginning of the hit-making success for H&O during the 1980's and propelled them to be the number one selling duo in pop-rock history. This album,along with PRIVATE EYES and H2O made Hall and Oates into a household name and their videos #1 on MTV in the decade of excess. I highly recommend all three of these CDs to real fans of the rock and soul legends, Hall and Oates!!!
0,Incredible voice!
0,I am one of the biggest Cuture Club fans. In the 80's it was not uncommon for me to own everything they did and finally the best of videos arrives. This disc is filled with every Culture Club Video hits like Karma chameleon and Do you really want to hurt me (uncut version) also the european videos never shown in the U.S. like victims, medal Song, Love is love, God thank you woman and all of the videos off their last CD including I just wanna be loved, Your kisses are charity and Cold Shoulder. Plus there are interviews with the band mostly George and Jon though and performaces from the only other cuture club video from the 80's "kiss accross the ocean" which was originally shown on HBO. This collection is great for the fan and I'm pleased that someone finally put it out very smart move.
0,Aerosmith came into their own on their second album, Get Your Wings. This is one of those albums that didn't sell much at the time it came out but grew in stature after the band became popular. Get Your Wings is one of the band's five best albums with a few of its songs still getting airplay almost 40 years later. The most popular song is the opening track "Same Old Song And Dance" which boasts one of Joe Perry's most memorable riffs and an equally memorable lyric and vocal performance from Steven Tyler. The moody "Lord of The Thighs" is a killer while their rendition of the Yardbirds' "Train Kept A Rollin'" is one of those few songs where the cover is the better than the original. Deeper cuts such as the fan favorite "Seasons of Wither" and the gritty "Pandora's Box" are nearly as impressive and have aged very well. And while the lesser known rockers "S.O.S. (Too Bad)", "Spaced", and "Woman of the World" aren't exactly classics, the band's raw delivery and hungry performance on each bring them up a notch.  Get Your Wings is a strong slab of dirty rock n' roll and is a harbinger of the greatness that would come with their next two albums, Toys in the Attic and Rocks.
0,As advertised thank you
0,Unlike some of Susannah's albums, this one has no particular theme but it opens with a cover of a Billie Holiday song (Laughing at life). Something to live for (despite its title, a very melancholy song) is followed by the much brighter Look for the silver lining. Next comes Nuages (a Django Reinhardt classic).	Caminhos cruzados is a Jobim song that Susannah sings here in its original language because she could not get permission to record a translated version. I wish I were in love again (a Rodgers and Hart classic) is followed by I ain't gonna pay no second fiddle (a cover of a Bessie Smith song), Losing had (a very early Ray Charles song) and I want to be a sideman (a contemporary song). Then comes another Jobim song in its original language, Insensatez, but this is famous in English as How insensitive.	Two obscure songs (A phone call to the past, Stop time) are followed by another Jobim song (Wave). The set ends with what is surely the most famous song here, the Irving Berlin classic, Blue skies.	This was among the last albums that Susannah recorded and is well up to the standard that everybody expected.
0,Been looking for an album to bring me out of my long reviewing hiatus, and I think I've found it.  I've been an Iced Earth fan for many years, and every new album from them is like a visit from an old friend.  The road's been bumpy here and there.  I never quite warmed up to Tim Owens as a singer for the band, and although he was working a bit more toward hitting his stride, I certainly couldn't complain about getting Barlow back, even if it was only for one more album.  So, when I heard he was once again departing, I was apprehensive.  I had seen Stu Block with Into Eternity when they opened for Dream Theater a few years ago, and although I enjoyed them, I couldn't for a second imagine him singing with Iced Earth.  However, my expectations were blown clear out of the water as much they possibly could be.		Now, Matt Barlow is still one of my all-time favorite singers in any style, so it's certainly no small thing for me to say that Block is the ONLY singer I have heard who comes even remotely close to fitting in with the band in the same way that Barlow did...and he comes VERY close.  I mean, as far as the passion, versatility, range, he's nearly a dead ringer.  He's got a great "ballad voice" too, which to me was Owens' biggest weakness.		As for the album itself, it's just fantastic.  Jon Schaffer picks up where the politically charged lyrics of Sons of Liberty left off, and delivers a tour-de-force concept of an Orwellian future that may be much more reality than fantasy.  I enjoyed SoL, but to me it was more about the lyrics than the music.  Not so here.  This album contains stirring lyrical content, with much more solid songwriting.  I don't quite subscribe to all of the "Alex Jonesy" stuff, but I know quite well that the walls of fascism are closing in fast, and Schaffer delivers a rousing manifesto of defiance.  (Also, I dig the shout-outs to libertarian heroes Ron Paul, Michael Badnarik, and Judge Napolitano in the liner notes, as well as the line about "taking the road to serfdom", which I assume is a reference to the Friedrich Hayek classic).  Jon's definitely done his homework, and come a long way since "The Glorious Burden".		Musically, this is everything there is to love about Iced Earth, so even if you write off the lyrics as "just a bunch of crazy conspiracy stuff", there's still much to enjoy.  Some complained the last album was too "mid-paced", but this one's not the case.  It's filled with blistering riffs, Maiden-inspired melodies, and huge anthemic choruses.  "Anthem", "V", and the title track are just huge and epic, even in in their fairly short lengths.  "End of Innocence" and "Anguish of Youth" are beautiful ballads, and "Days of Rage" is every bit as crushingly heavy as you'd expect.  The album ends with the super-huge "Tragedy and Triumph", which drips with classic Iron Maiden influence, and leaves you wanting more.  The album is fairly short (about 45 minutes), but it packs in a lot of goodness, and really could probably never be long enough.		All in all, this album has satisfied me thoroughly on so many levels.  No one could really replace Matt, of course, but Block has done an incredible job, and I hope to hear him do much more with him in the future.  I'll be seeing them live in about a week, and I can't wait to hear him do the classic stuff justice like few could (his version of "Dante's Inferno" is jaw-dropping, definitely check that out).  Yep, the band is definitely in good hands, it would seem.  Thanks, Iced Earth.  I wish you well.
0,I love this music and the waltz goes on and on.  I fill my home with this music.  Where did this man come from and how did I miss him.  One day as I was checking out what the Radio Hall of Music had going on last Christmas 2011 there it was. I was curious so  I clicked on it and have been swept away on a cloud of musical notes and rhythm that holds my heart and mind captive as the beautiful talented family of musicians play skillfully with teasing with their eyes and body language as they sweep you off into another world of joy.  Andre' Rieu has masterly form this group of people into one of the most family oriented and easy to watch concerts.
0,I did not get around to buying this CD until now.  A mistake of a delay, even though I had heard a few cuts in the past.  This one is right up there with Starset, another fave.  This has got to be one of the freshest sounding groups that I have heard.  I love it when I score a gem.  It's happened often lately since I rely on Amazon reviews to point me into the right direction and also related artist outputs.  It's too early for me to comment specifically.  However, these guys are over the top great.  I will enjoy listening more first.  Those first listens are always on over the ear headphones. I am into production values as well as musical content, over the ear headphones are most revealing.		Honestly, I felt this way after the first listen and it hasn't changed.		THIS IS A VISCERALLY SONIC TOUR.  THERE IS A THEME.  YOU INTERPRET IT.  TAKE THIS.
0,If the 70's band Chic and Daft Punk had a baby, it would be named Chromeo. If you like that sound you'll like the album, otherwise you won't hear much else to listen to. Also, please Chromeo if you ever read this - stop singing your own songs! You are great disco-funk song writers and arrangers, but but if you want to become a really major act you need top-tier vocalists. (Others seems to feel the same way- I noticed that one of your songs from this album was synch-licensed for the Emmy Awards commercial but they cut out your vocals!)
0,This album is incredible. I don't understand all the haters, but I guess some people were expecting something that sounded similar to "Movies For The Blind" and this is a totally different CD. "Movies For The Blind" was more like an underground album of Cage doin' his own thing and Nighthawks was Cage and Camu Tao taking a break from their stuff and making a fun album about crooked cops and they kept the sound really East Coast. This is why I feel you can't compare the two albums, this is more a CD for when you're in the mood for something catchy and fun. The production on this album is sweet and that really shows on tracks like, "Street Poly" and "Keep The City Up". For me, this is an album where you don't wanna skip any tracks, I can listen to this start to finish time and time again. Over all, if you like Cage, NonPhixion, or Necro, you won't necessarily enjoy this CD; but if you like that stuff along with some of the more mainstream, but intelligent, East Coast stuff (such as maybe, Nas or Wu-Tang) then get this. Just don't expect a very serious and emotional CD with Nighthawks since this was just a side project obviously done with a more laid back vibe.
0,This album has a lot of awesome stuff on it but its not as good as God Was Created. This album sounds too much like typical death metal and GWC was incredibly original. Don't get me wrong, I still love it and love this band but they need to go back to being as original as they were on GWC.
0,I originally bought this to replace my cassette copy.
0,When I am feeling down, I dig into some Alexander or some Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. I feel it, and move on.
0,The Followill boys did it again. It only took 2 full listens to love this album. From beginning to end, it is a very strong album. They sound extremely tight and there's definitely a lot of progression to their sound but you know it's KoL.
0,The best from the best. And it even included Bell Bottom Blues-it will make you open my ears and say, "Ah".
0,Very True metal Manowar did not water down like some 80's metal bands did in the 90's I still love some Frickin Manowar
0,All the songs you remember that don't get played anymore.
0,The tone of Brown is gorgeous and the album works as a wonderful showcase for Brown whose pure playing booms and solos out clearly over and away from the strings..the album's mix sounds somewhat juxtaposed but this was 1956..and the record does say Clifford Brown with Strings..		Of course it could have been better in retrospect when one considers a similar concept such as Bird's with Strings..but then again let us be glad this CD reissue was given fine treatment and sound, wonderfully packaged with emotive quality.
0,The beginning of Glam Rock in the late 70's. Amazing!!
0,If you love the movie then the soundtrack should be good for you also. This was a must have after the movie becuase it holds a lot of meaning for me. If you have not read the book, seen the movie or listened to the music, I think you better do that.
0,...why would I like to own a cd compilation of songs I already have? Besides, they always ignore my favoite and their greatest song Rime Of The Ancient Mariner.
0,Essential delta-blues from arguably the finest 12-bar blues prodigy, and one of the originators of bluesy modern rock and roll, a'la Rolling Stones. You NEED this in your collection.
0,EXCELLENT--NO PROBLEMS--THANKS
0,! Music!
0,Great experience
0,There really is something to a band that has played together in some form for over thirty years! This is the best of the three studio efforts since Steve Morse replaced Ritchie Blackmore. The songs are catchy, varied, and exceptionally tight. "House Of Pain" starts things off well, and the other Gillan-Bradford penned "Walk On" is very good as well. The last track, "Contact Lost" by Morse is an excellent instrumental.
0,I would be hard pressed to name one Doors album the best. I could never ever call one the worst, because I think every one was great. This is a perfect album if you ask me. Not one average song on the list, they are all great. If you don't like it, you don't like the Doors. I do not consider it too mellow or light, where does that come from? "Five to One"? "Unknown Soldier"? Great great album from America's greatest ever band.
0,funny, i bought this cd way back in 1993. i have always been a fan of the manhattan transfer, but not too much of jazz.  this is their glorious 2-cd collection of mostly pop/jazz renditions.		starting with "trickle trickle" you travel with MT in their career-spanning greatest hits.  and as the liner notes said, this 2-cd compilation came from no less than nine albums!		this is so far the best sounding, best in content, and best in packaging MANHATTAN TRANSFER album ever compiled by Atlantic Records and released by Rhino...		my favorite tracks include:		 Trickle Trickle, Mystery, Baby Come Back To Me (The Morse Code Of Love)(this is really a fun song!) Route 66, Java Jive, Smile Again (a ballad during my high school days - touching and romantic),	Spice Of Life, The Speak Up Mambo (Cuentame, Soul Food To Go (Sina), So You Say (Esquinas), Boy From New York City (a classic!), Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone (a real winner!), Blee Blop Blues, On A Little Street In Singapore, Tuxedo Junction, Sing Joy Spring, Until I Meet You (Corner Pocket)(this is great song!), Capim, A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square (wow!) Birdland (the best song to end this compilation!)		the sound quality is also so great. rhino has always pioneered the great sounds in cd with their previous compilations....		can't wait to go down in birdland!
0,Los cuartetos de cuerdas de Franz Joseph Haydn, son indudablemente despus de  los de Ludwig Van Beethoven (Los cuartetos de Beethoven son incomparables, los mejores sin lugar a la menor duda) y junto con los tres ltimos de Schubert, un par de los Mozart, la mayora de los de Shostakovich, los de Debussy y Ravel (uno cada uno) y obviamente los de Bla Bartok, son la piedra fundamental dentro del genero ms importante dentro de la msica de cmara, los Cuartetos de cuerdas (Dos Violines, una Viola y un Chelo).	Es realmente asombroso que un paquete tan pequeo fsicamente tenga tanta msica maravillosa. La interpretacin del Cuarteto Aeolian (No se preocupe si no los conoce, realmente son bastante desconocidos para la gran mayora de los aficionados a la msica) es de un nivel extraordinario, comparando con algunos cuartetos sueltos que tengo por cuartetos de gran renombre como son el Amadeus y el Emerson, estas versiones del Aeolian no tienen nada que envidiarle, son unos virtuosos de PRIMER NIVEL! El registro sonoro de los discos por DECCA es excelente. Por lo tanto este lbum es fundamental para los que amamos al gran Papa Haydn, adems que esta es la gran posibilidad de comprar todos los cuartetos de un solo golpe, imagnese como sera irlos comprando de a poco, una tarea muy difcil y seguramente que con muchas duplicidades por lo tanto a un costo inmensamente superior. No lo dude, ni por un instante, cmprelo. Estoy seguro que no se arrepentir jams!
0,I like all of the Cellarful recordings because they allow us to hear that MANY people were instrumental in making Motown a world-wide soundtrack of the millenium.
0,Harry Russell works as the buyer of 12" dance singles for Watts Distribution in New York City proper. He's heard his fair share of dance records over the years, managing to collect a few of the best ones along the way. He tends to lean toward independent releases that normally wouldn't see the light of day. He plays them regularly for friends at his home parties - Club H, and recommends them to record store buyer nationwide. In his early 40's now, he might be a tad old to spin the ones and twos, but there's no limit on taste (which he has acquired in abundance). The initial issue of what has become the infamous "Harry The Bastard Presents Club H" series might be the best. Downtempo house without divas for those who want to come down from the frantic pace of club life gets you the likes of St. Germain's - Deep In it, Azymuth - Space Jazz, Hot Lizard - 165 Drop (Charles Webster Mix), Pepe Bradock - De' Mare Le Chauve, Crazy Penis - Get It On, Global Communications - The Way The Deep, Atjazz - Fifth Quarter, the elusive K-Hand - 2 Low Key, and Soul Parlor - Right On. This could possibly be the best collection of great house music you've never heard. It's so good I have no doubt it will stand the test of time and improve like great wine as you mature. My personal copy was slipped to me by a record store owner many months before it became available. Of course I've added the other two and come back often for a spin as a high water mark to judge others by.  When someone complains about house music being all repetitive, this is what I refer them too. One day when they write the history of dance music phenomena they will no doubt include a chapter about the great parties and music that came from Club H. Long live the bastard and the music that he wrought.
0,Its great pretty good music
0,In todays rap, your lucky if you'll even get 2 good songs on a $14 album. Well, on Busta Rhymes's The Big Bang, I assure you, you will get your money's worth. There have been so-so reviews about this album. I fully understand why. Sure, its not as solid as the rap of yesteryear. The lyrics are tired, and the guy who used to bring the most energy into the room, now falls behind numerous cast apperances. But I'm grading this record purly on substance. Most albums out right now are nothing but catchy, poppy, and club driven. I haven't heard a full album in a long time. One i could just put in, and not every song would contain a song meant for the clubs. With production by J Dilla, Sha Money XL, Dr. Dre, Swizz Beatz, and more, there are a lot of seemingly wasted beats here and there. But its a start. Quality rap is starting to show now and then, and I think this album made a good contribution. Let's face it, Busta Rhymes is a Hip-Hop legend. It's always nice to see a guy from another generation of rap keep doin what he does, but he may have lost his touch just a little bit. I still maintain that this album was worth it. Busta Rhymes may not have his beloved dreads anymore, but make no mistake, he still has a little bit of that magic touch left.
0,if you don't own this you are definitely missing out on a big part of hip-hop. Slug has mad skill in the studio and on the mic in general. Check this album, give it a few listens and I guarantee you'll see the true genius of this production.
0,BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT, BUT I KNOW THE RECIPIENT LOVES IT.  WOULD RECOMMEND TO PURCHASE EVEN IF YOU HAVE SOME OF THE SONGS ALREADY.  NOBODY CAN HAVE TOO MUCH ELVIS
0,Good music. This was a gift for my wife, but we both like the music.
0,I am very happy with this Christmas CD from Kelly.  Her voice sounds amazing as usual.  There are some fine selections of classic Christmas songs as well as new songs that I'm sure at least one or two of them will become classics.  Great job, Kelly!
0,I liked George so much on American Idol 3, and I really wanted him to win. I noticed George from his first audition and I think he is really talented. I also think his smile just lights up the room. His voice is pretty good too! :) I think the judges were too hard on George and gave the girls all the kudos. That was unfair. It doesn't matter now though, because here George is in all his glory. Want a talented young man he is.		I enjoyed every cut on this short-version cd. The bluesy, R&B feel is evident in all the songs and George's voice sounds wonderful. I will be real curious to see what George does from here forward. I will continue to buy his music.		You did a great job, George!
0,Diana (Deluxe Edition)	 "Diana" produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of Chic fame is a stand out on it's own,every track being hit worthy. Now with the addition of tracks from the hard to find (Baby's It's me)such as Top Of The World" and "Your Love Is So Good For Me" plus obscure tracks like "Sweet Summertime Livin'","Fire Don't Burn" and "We Can Never Light That Old Flame Again" and the beautiful "You Were The One" make it irresistible. They even throw a little bit of flavor from The Boss with "I Aint Been Licked" If I were told I could only buy one Diana Ross CD"heaven forbid" it would be this one..
0,Good
0,If there is one word to describe this album, it is MAGICAL! The music and lyrics are woven together to create a musical journey into a magical fairytale land. The listener drifts away to another time and place, a place on animals and insects in the forests and meadows all preparing for the grand ball. Conceived, written, and directed by Roger Glover of Deep Purple fame, this is brilliant stuff. There are 20 short songs which flow together perfectly to tell the hopes, dreams, desires, and feelings of the various characters as they approach the grand event. One might think that on such a massive project with so many artists involved, that too many cooks might spoil the soup. This is definitely NOT the case. For example, each vocalist is perfectly suited to the type of song he/she is singing and to the character he/she represents. And althiugh numerous various instruments are employed, they are never employed so indulgently that they get in the way of each other or clutter up the total sound. The production quality is very good and for the most part the mix of instruments is just about right. This is a far cry from the hard rock of Deep Purple, but it is a refreshing change and definite "classic" that should find a comfortable home in anyone's CD collection, whether you are a fan of Barry Manilow or Led Zeppelin. (Do yourself a favor and shell get this enhanced version with the cartoon video you can view right through your computer - the artwork has an Alice-in-Wonderland quality and helps the listener visualize the images being portrayed by the music. The few extra bucks are well worth it!)
0,Bought a second one, this one for my car, since we play this at home so often.

0,What can we say ? More than two hours of Rush doing their best, showing what good musicians and serious professionals can do and "have to" do. A tremendous sound impact: you can sense the power of this cd from the beginning, "Dreamline" is a devastating intro, played with roughness and energy and the show begins.		For me certainly the best live from the Canadians: as hard as "All the world's a stage" but recorded and played much better; as elegant and full of emotions as "Exit stage left" but heavier and less meditative; more complete than "A show of hands"; well above the average of "Rush in Rio" , a commercial release, played ,mixed and recorded in a way that I don't really like.		So don't hesitate:buy it. You don't have to be a Rush fan to appreciate it: this record resumes the story of Rush and rock and it's well worth its price.
0,Edsel hits it out of the ballpark yet again, repackaging one of Belinda's latter efforts, all but missed in the U.S.  The sound is fantastic, as are the extra tracks.  Well done.  Again.  This is the way to do a re-release of iconic material.
0,A couple of days ago I was flipping through the channels, and I saw a old face I hadn't seen in awhile; it was the face of Minister Mason Betha. You know,Mason Betha;the guy who used to rap with Puff Daddy about having mo' money and mo' problems? The guy with the 10 year old voice and 12 year old lyrics? Yeah, that guy. The proclaimed sinner turned winner delivered one of the most soul stirring speeches I've ever heard; after that I have made it a priority to attend church. In honor of Minister Mase; I will review his debut album, Harlem World.	This album is the exact opposite of what the 21st century Mase is about;sexual consumption, materalism , misongony	y and some violence. But this review is the old Mase, the seemilnly nieve and fun protege of Puff Daddy. Mase had the reins handed to him as Bad Boy's premier act after the death of the Notorious B.I.G, and kicked off the brief and cheesey "shiny suit'era of hip hop, full of saples of '70's and '80's disco and pop hits. Kool and The Gang, Teena Marie, Yarbourough and Peoples and others get their beats rocked over mase lyrics. And speaking of the lyrics, they aren't half bad. The best songs are Lookin' At Me, Feels So Good and the great posse joint 24 hours to Live with the LOX, Black Rob(what happened to him?) and one of many cameos by DMX in late'97 and early '98.
0,As a teenager, I'd been quite smitten with the early Clan of Xymox hits, Stranger, etc.  But when Imagination hit the airwaves in 1989, I couldn't believe my ears.  This was perfection!  With their haunting vocals, swooning guitars and keyboards, and a lush production that made them sound  like a choir of fallen angels, Xymox was probably the first  "gothic" group I ever fell in love with.  If you're looking for a  vibrant, near-perfect work that lies somewhere between gothic, dance, and  ethereal music, buy this!  It will instantly become one of your  most-beloved CDs.
0,Like caviar and oysters perhaps this recording is an acquired taste...and it needs several hearings to fully appreciate, after which it becomes addictive; it has a down-home Mississippi muddy feel that makes it Dylan's grittiest album, and one of my favorites. His voice sounds like freshly poured gravel, adding to its charm and old time blues quality.	The musicianship is extraordinary: Larry Campbell is fabulous on guitar, violin, banjo and mandolin, as is Charlie Sexton on guitar, Tony Garnier on bass, Augie Meyers on organ and accordion, and David Kemper will knock your socks off on drums.	The songs are melodic and words poetic and powerful. The CD insert is a single sheet fold-out, so does not include the lyrics, but they are worth searching out to read and relish the brilliance, see the light and darkness, hope and affliction, and the balance of humor. "Po' Boy" even has a knock knock joke:	Knockin' on the door,	I say "who is it and where are you from ?"	Man says "Freddy !"	I say "Freddy who ?"	He says, "Freddy or not, here I come".	There is greatness in this CD, even though it might not seem so with casual listening. Plumb the depths and it will reward you. Total playing time is 57'30.
0,Both of these live sets rock with energy and passion, just like RJD lived his life. The setlists are cool mix of Rainbow, Sabbath and his solo hits.  Only gave this 4 stars, because 1 of the live cds sounds poor.  I am a big live music collector and was surprised to hear lots of hissing when you crank it up. The other disc sounds great though and well worth adding classic metal riffs from an Icon to your collection.  The artwork and inserts are awesome. I wish that I could have seen him live on his recent comeback shows w/ Heaven & Hell.
0,I see a lot of griping about this disc, but everyone is missing the point: you can get her Atlantic stuff easily on Amazon or Ebay... this CD is a great way to get her early solo singles as well as her singles with Q and SSQ. "Screaming In My Pillow" and "Synthicide" are great Berlin/Missing Persons LA-style new wave, and "Playback" is just great!		Anyone who really loves Stacey Q should own this.... the other posers should stop whining and go buy a Totally 80s comp.
0,this is my fav by Scorpions. so ordering it, and reasonable price is great. securely packaged, arrived on time, actually early. good sound quality. happy with purchase
0,Great music by my favourite ladies. Superior packaging and delivery is better than Amazon
0,Excellent album, I personally feel that the Peppers began to write good music with BSSM and have been progressing and getting much better since Anthony decided to sing instead of rap, and I am glad Dave Navarrow was only with them for a hot minute.  Californication, By the Way, and Stadium Arcadium are near masterpieces and all really stand out on their own.  The same can be said for I'm With You, this album is excellent and who better to replace John than one of his best friends who has been collaborating with John on most of his solo projects over the last decade.  Anyways, I had to force myself to stop listening to it after about three weeks so I didn't wear it out.  I hope they tour close to my area soon so I can enjoy some of the new songs live, even though Anthony, Flea, and Chad are almost 50 years old I know they can still get Red Hot on stage.
0,The Platinum Collection is perfect for someone like me, a listener of Queen's radio hits and a non collector of their albums.		Most of their best known songs are represented in the first two discs.		Greatest Hits 1 opens with Bohemian Rhapsody and includes Another One Bites The Dust, Crazy Little Thing Called Love and Don't Stop Me Now. It also contains the iconic Queen anthems We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions.		Greatest Hits 2 has some of the songs that I like better such as A Kind Of Magic, Under Pressure, Radio Ga Ga, I Want To Break Free and Who Wants To Live Forever?		Greatest Hits 3 is a mixed bag of guest vocalists, Freddie Mercury solos, remixes and other surprises. Elton John does an excellent job on The Show Must Go On and Somebody To Love featuring George Michael is taken from Five Live. There are remixes of Under Pressure and Another One Bites The Dust featuring Wyclef Jean. For me, the lovely surprises are the operatic duet Barcelona, Too Much Love Can Kill You, The Great Pretender and Thank God It's Christmas. So, Greatest Hits 3 is definitely terrific.		Unfortunately, the songs are not remastered. So I have to turn up the volume a few notches just to hear them clearly.		The discs are housed in a compact jewel box enclosed in a platinum slipcase. A very nice touch.		The three can be purchased separately but if you haven't bought any of these, it is much cheaper to get The Platinum Collection. It's a great bargain!
0,I love this album, and I'm not a JT fan! I guess I am now. Timbaland hooked him up with the beats. Wish there were more songs though.
0,"Hail To The King" is great! This is another great album from Avenged Sevenfold. This is one of the best rock / metal albums of the year. All (10) tracks on here are great.		Track Listing	1. Shepherd Of Fire (4 out of 4 stars)	2. Hail To The King (4 out of 4 stars)	3. Doing Time (4 out of 4 stars)	4. This Means War (4 out of 4 stars)	5. Requiem (4 out of 4 stars)	6. Crimson Day (4 out of 4 stars)	7. Heretic (4 out of 4 stars)	8. Coming Home (4 out of 4 stars)	9. Planets (4 out of 4 stars)	10. Acid Rain (4 out of 4 stars)
0,Finally, in April of 2006; the Goo Goo Dolls released their third Mainstream album: LET LOVE IN. Fans had been left waiting another four years since the rock band's last record in order to hear this one. This record was well worth it. LET LOVE IN delevers more of the Goo Goo Dolls' gritty and grudgy pop/rock. Remarkably, it is Robby Takac who has a more softer pop oriented sound to this album. All of his tracks are the best he has ever produced and leaves the listener to wander what he will come up with next. Johnny Rzeznik has a much more darker rock style to most of his pieces. There are some that are a light sound with heartfelt lyrics. His guitar playing has truly evolved on this album. Rzeznik has his accoustic rhythm progressions, but he has also added very melodic electric guitar lines. This performance makes Rzeznik's work really ring to the ear. It also shows that Rzeznik is over his hard rocker days and is much more in touch with the importance of melodies and harmonies to music. His rendetion of "Give A Little Bit" is well arranged and is given an outstanding performance. It is clear that the Goo Goo Dolls are working hard to progress as musicians and are greatly acheiveing their goal. This record landed the band a performance on the Today Show during the winter of 2005 and brought in a large fan base to await this amazing album. LET LOVE IN is the Goo Goo Dolls' best work and a must have for any music collection.		Stand out tracks include:		"Stay With You"		"Let Love In"		"Better Days"		"Listen"		"Give A Little Bit"
0,a great album, by a great band! fast shipping and excellent quality!  This cat power album has the style I lovee from CAt power with many songs I had never heard.  Great quality and fast shipping for a low price! I recommend this!
0,The Scorpions are not just a great band from the 80's struggling to survive now, but also one of the greatest rock n' roll bands ever! This double album does a great job in covering their gems from the Mercury years, and also features 2 previously unreleased tracks. All the songs on this album are just great (especially from disc 1). It also features a killer album cover! THE SCORPIONS WILL ONCE AGAIN RULE THE WORLD!!!	ANYONE KNOW WHEN THEIR ACOUSTICA ALBUM WILL BE RELEASED IN THE U.S.?? (Been looking for it like crazy for the last few weeks)
0,A very very good cd. It's very old but it's the 1st Snoop Doggy Dogg album! Many singles were exctracted from this album: Who Am I (What's my name), Doggy Dogg World, Gin & Juice... So, this album countains some hits and good songs who weren't hits. I recommand this to all Snoop Dogg's Fans, Westcoast Fans, G-Funk Fans, Rap auditors... You are obliged to have this cd if you think be a Snoop Doggy Dogg Fan!
0,Back in 2011 when Anvil released "Juggernaut of Justice," it was apparent that they were on the verge of something. Sure, their previous albums were filled with crunching riffs and decent songs, but that album showed a band that was close to putting it all together. For the majority of "Hope in Hell, Anvil does put it all together. There are two exceptional songs right in the middle of the album, "Pay the Toll" and "Flying," that are among the band's most melodic tracks. And that's not to say this album doesn't hit hard. Actually it hits a bit harder than "Juggernaut," making it all the more impressive. This album is highly recommended for fans of this band, or fans of good old fashioned metal in general. You can't go wrong with this. 4.5 stars.
0,I absolutly loved this album. I discovered Within Temptation recently, and i am so glad i finally saw what i was missing. Evanescence they ar4e not, this band is much better!		From The Howling to The longer version of What Have You Done featuring Keith Caputo(an awesome singer) this is a cd you don't want to miss.		My personal favorite, What Have You done, is not their usual stuff, it's a bit more toned down, i guess you could say. I really love Our Solemn Hour, its such a powerful song.		Worth the price.
0,I bought this when  the LP came out because  it had been touted as the first  'all Digital'  creation(This was before the CD format was available). Apparently  Wonder was originally going to record the sound F/X ,such  as the nature sounds,etc. digitally but was so taken by the clarity of the recordings ,that he started over, re-recording the entire album on a digital recorder. The result was the first commercally released work. Spectacular Audio! I still have the LP;Bought the CD 5 yrs. ago;also got a copy of film on VHS - where's the DVD?  Edd. iegolden@shaw.ca  .	ATTENTION Juan Alemporte & Neil Sternberg: I can't respond to your emails without addresses  ???@???.	(...)
0,Witty bars over vintage beats. Tight work.
0,I stumbled on the concert itself on one of the music channels on TV and was blown away by the music.  Springsteen was awesome,  Dion rocked on, and I thought Simon and Garfunkel stole the show!!  I had to have the CDs.  Packaging ably protected the item and shipping was expeditious!  I still can't put it down, and I am beginning to like Metallica!!!  A wonderful bit of music!
0,Five Iron Frenzy probably could have made this an EP, and it may have been their most succesful CD. If I were to hand pick the songs for an EP it would be Flowery Song, When The Zero Meets Fifteen, Arnold Will And Mr Drummond, The Wild West, and Track #'S 11 and 12. Besides those 6 songs  there is not much here, but those 6 songs are all great. So it is really an  awesome value for a Five Iron Frenzy CD. As always FIF has the usual blazing guitars, loud horns, tight  drums, sweet bass lines, and you can't beat Reese on vocals. And as usual  Five Iron throws in some great humor as well.
0,rush,s hemispheres was released in 1978 and was the follow up to the farewell to kings album the year before.hemispheres continues the tale of the space traveller caught up in the fearsome force of cygnus x-1,the black hole.in fact track one is called cygnus x-1,book 2.this epic song seems to tell the tale of the struggle of the gods of love and reason in the mind of man to rule the fate of man. as the drama in the song continues the space traveller now a disembodied spirit comes before the gods of olympus after the battle of the gods and the traveller is made the god of balance bettween the forces of love and reason,in their eternal struggle.the traveller is called cygnus bringer of balance.through out track one rush masterfully creates a multifacetted soundscape perfect for the concept of the story.in my opion rush perfectly show case the amazing muscianship on this great  album! also on this album are the songs that are independant from the over all concept theme of hemispheres circumstances which is good,the trees which is very cool and finally la villa strangiato again showcasing rush,s amazing muscianship! in my opinion hemispheres closed chapter one of rush,s musical story and so very well after hemispheres rush wanted to record more radio friendly shorter more accessable songs...so begins the next chapter with permanent waves!!if you like rush,s progressive concept theme era hemispheres is a good addition to the collection!!

0,Considering the age of this (remastered) recording, the audio quality (on a high end - 8 speaker Harmon Kardon car system) is remarkable.  I never really got a sense of exactly how good a group of musicians the original line-up was.  This live performance affords them all the opportunity to stretch even the most familiar hit riffs into something completely different and ultimately satisfying.
0,great cd...classic wu-tang. c'mon, buy this cd..its worth your money. every song is great.
0,The first time I was exposed to Sarah Brightman's work was when I was sixteen. I'm seventeen now and find it strange how but a year ago I couldn't bare to listen to "Eden," and how it made me cringe when she reached those high notes. But now, in fact, I do quite the opposite. I suppose being so young and so limited to what kind of music was presenting itself on mainstream radio that, in effect, it really blocked my ears to some amazing genres. I know it sounds a bit extreme, but the beautiful Ms. Brightman really did open many doors for me to discovering new, exciting music I didn't know existed until now. I used to generally listen to nothing but Alternative rock (which I still do), but now I've moved on to stretch my horizon of eclectic tastes. And "how" she did this, you ask? Because she's almost every genre in itself! I personally feel that "La Luna" showcases her diverse sense of sound better than "Eden," which is either pop or opera, but she's also very talented in creating other types of music such as rock (Fly), ethereal pop (Dive), pure opera and Broadway (The Andrew Loyde Webber Collection), and even jazz and new age, which is conveyed best on the songs "Gloomy Sunday" and "Scarborough Fair" from her "La Luna" Cd. What can I say? I am constantly amazed by her persistence of reinvention. It's always a surprise with her. You just never know what she's going to do next, and that suits me just fine. You never have to worry about her being redundant, dull or boring. Oh no... I personally feel that more opera singers should make the departure from same old aria after aria into the wonderful world of classical-crossover.	Now, true; in "Eden" Sarah uses her upper register more often than her normal voice, but--take this from a person who listens to heavy rock bands like Tool.... You don't have to be an opera-buff to live through this. It's like walking through "Paradisum" and ending up in "Eden."	"So Many Things" (the third track which she wrote herself) is a short, soft ballad about her divorce with ex-husband Andrew Loyde Webber. And entailing that is my all-time favorite: "Anytime, Anywhere," which mixes both classical vocals with pop. Then comes the first traditional piece: "Bailero" which is very soothing and sedating, almost making your eyes drift shut until a cover of Kansas's "Dust In The Wind" rocks you like a storm. (Now don't let ANYBODY convince you that this song is corny, because it's anything BUT that!) And.... well I'm not going to go through every song, but the gospel-like "Deliver Me" is a beautiful pop addition, and "Il Mio Cuore Va (My Heart Will Go On)" is just as lovely, if not more, than Celine's version. Some of my favorites, though, would have to be Un Jour Il Viendra, Only An Ocean Away--which is a heartfelt ballad--and Nessun Dorma, which was made for a tenors voice but, like magic, was sung by an angelic soprano known as Sarah Brightman. But rest assure. No matter what your musical tastes are like, almost anyone can squeeze a little Sarah in. That is until you're ready for more....

0,This is the quintessential metal live album that all others must base themselves upon. Ozzy's "Tribute", Priest's "Unleashed in the East", AC/DC's "If You Want Blood.." although great  albums in there own right, just don't measure up to the awesome ferocity  and timeless power of this 2-CD collection. Typical of mid-80's Maiden, the  band is tight, Dickinson's vocals are powerful and the production is  perfect. The recording is primarily from Maiden's sold out performances at  Long Beach Arena in 1985, but the inclusion of a partial set from a show at  Hammersmith Odeon in London with mostly "older/classic" tunes  brings this album to a mightier level. "Phantom of the Opera"  live needs to be heard to be believed. Other highlights are "The  Trooper", "Hallowed Be Thy Name" & "Rime of the  Ancient Mariner." Owning this album is seemingly a prerequisite to be  a Maiden fan.
0,This band and this cd killed when it came out during the grunge era...got overlooked bu it really is brilliant. Benjamin, the singer, just passed away after his 8 year battle with Diabetes...give it a listen in tribute...truly brilliant.
0,AAA GREAT

0,New to Deerhunter and I can't believe all the great music I've been missing.
0,Grace Under Pressure is my absolute favorite they did during the mid '80s techno period. Grace uses more synthesizer than Signals which is also a good one worth checking out but less than they would on their next. Signals is a classic and a favorite of fans today, I'd have to agree that it's one of their finest but I always preferred Grace Under Pressure. The overall atmosphere is a bit darker than Signals and it has a more focused edge to it. This was the bands 2nd step into '80s new wave/techno (3rd if you include Moving Pictures) and they juste seemed to get everything right here. Distant Early Warning is a minor classic and a great way to start the albums off which gives us a good example of what the album will be like throughout; atmospheric, dark, unique, intelligent, technical and melodic. Grace has just the right balance of techno and rock with a good use of synthesizer yet it doesn't overpower the guitar. Lyrically it's one of the bands greatest which deals with themes of nuclear war and the Cold War. 1970s Rush was probably the best but some of the futuristic theme in 2112 was hard to take seriously. Still an excellent album music-wise with some of the best drumming of any rock albums to date, however Grace's theme is a more realistic approach which we needed and it shows diversity and maturity in the band lyrically. Grace has many of Rush's finest moments from "Distant Early Warning" along with "The Body Electric", "Enemy Within" and "Red Rector A" as well as my personal favorite "Aftermath".	Grace Under Pressure is often overlooked but it's really among Rush's finest records and was the band at their height of their '80s techno period.
0,This band is simply amazing.  And this is coming from someone who doesn't really listen to hard rock all too much (I'm a metal kid). Maybe it's because there aren't enough bands like Gotthard who know how to play more than a few chords and really know where they're going with their songs. Anyways, I love this CD!		I first heard of this band through a CD called Metal Dreams Vol. 2, through a catchy little blues-tinged number called "Let It Rain". The song was very well-composed, and the band just had an excellent sound. I decided I wanted to hear more. So I ordered Human Zoo, their acclaimed 2003 effort. I had my doubts, after all, I wasn't too fond with this genre. But when the title track kicked in, I decided I liked it - it reminded me a bit of heavier Bon Jovi with a younger Rod Stewart on vocals.  "What I Like", the album's powerful single just caught my attention right when it first kicked in. It's such a beautiful song, thanks in part to Steve Lee's excellent voice, and had a very anthemic feel to it - similar to the great hard rock of the 70s and early 80s. "Top of the World" made me realize just how much I was truly enjoying myself when listening to this CD - it's just a great, upbeat rocker with an infectious chorus and great guitar playing. "Janie's Not Alone" is one of the more depressing tracks, mainly for its lyrical content, involving a girl from a poor background who lives on the streets and steals to stay alive. "One in a Million" is more of a driving tune - easily accessible, fun to sing along too and catchy as hell. Then comes a beautiful bluesy ballad called "First Time in a Long Time", an uplifting, inspirational song that is hard not to love. Everything to come next is also very good - and "Long Way Down" offers something a bit different for a change, adding some nice variety.		Let me say this, if you're a fan of rock (real rock, not alternative radio crap) or classic metal, why not take a chance and see if this wonderful band can leave an impression on you as it has on me? Definitely a must.		10/10
0,All of his greatest songs have been remastered and sound incredible on this CD.Takes you from the 60's to the 80's and is an incredible work of art! Don't miss out.
0,The best of Alvin Lee.
0,Great stuff!
0,DUSTY SPRINGFIELD was the best singing girl from BRITAIN in the sixties. In her first solo album from 1964, she displays her talent impressively. What is special about DUSTY is that she express emotions when she sings. Some great singers technically don't. DUSTY has a certain vulnerability about her which makes her touching. DUSTY was already a MOTOWN fan in 1964 and she always enjoyed singing with MARTHA REEVES and other MOTOWN acts on television. Composer BURT BACHARACH was very appreciative when DUSTY sang his songs and  he was right. DUSTY SPRINGFIELD makes some of today's lady singers look like midgets. She was simply real.
0,was everything I was expecting and more
0,This cd is incredible. heard the song Heavy Feet on Alt Nation,on Sirius satellite radio & just had to buy the cd. It did not disappoint. Thecd setsa definite tone, almost like the way Radiohead does. The cd just takes the listener to a new place & was happyto go along for the ride.
0,I've never met a performance of Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony I did not like.  It's probably the best feel good music ever written, though Howard Hansen's second is in contention as well for that honor. Certainly no exception this early Previn recording is a delight. Ah, but the recording quality quite frankly is just not up to snuff. RCA has done much better remastering Fritz Reiner and his Chicago Symphony recordings. Love Previn's performance but there are so many other fine performances available with better quality sound recording and digital encoding.  If you are in the market for only one recording, there are probably better choices, performance wise maybe not, sound wise for sure.
0,Here's a Scot that should be making big waves beyond her native shores; her debut in the U.S. has been long overdue.  The key draw thus far is her voice, which already contains much of the nuance and texture other artists take many years to develop.  That's not to say the lyrics are bad (though they can be uneven).  It's just that Macdonald's voice is the star.  Additionally, most of the songs feature infectious hooks and enjoyable arrangements.		MacDonald may be just leaving her 20's, but this isn't the type of music you're going to see hitting the pop charts.  This is well-arranged accoustic pop-rock.  The album strikes me as one of those great road trip cds.  I think a large part of that stems from the fact that the entire album is quite good.  You can listen to it from beginning to end without needing to skip tracks- especially if your focus is the music, itself (as is mine).		Macdonald has room to grow, but this is an excellent first taste.  A pleasing selection of tracks combined with exceptional vocals make this album one of the best of the year.
0,Lot of music/songs/value for the money.  Only missed one of his songs that I wanted.  Many songs must have been from his early days ("very" old).  Unfamiliar with some; some were remakes of well-known tunes.  A lot of listening.
0,Was a gift. pleased with quality , deliverance time and price. recpmmend seller
0,I've liked Neil Diamond for as long as I can remember,  I'll never tire of listening to his music
0,This is her best album to date! I love her new retro sound, her vocals sound good, its definitely a must have if you're a Jennifer fan, the tracks that stand out are "Stay Together", "Forever", "Do It Well", "", "Wrong when you're gone", "Brave" and of course "Mile in these shoes" (my personal fav), I htink she paired up with the right producres on this one, of course her previous efforts have been good and have done alright but this one is my fav having 'This is me..then' as my second fav. 'Well done' Jennifer!!
0,This album is the real deal alright!  John Coltrane at his best along with Johnny Hartman, on of the greatest crooners of the fifties and sixties.  I have a lot of music from both artists individually, but this one is my favorite.  And the price is right.  Try it and enjoy!
0,Excellent listening experience.
0,Great. Awesome: So Good.
0,Nice selection but wish it had a few more favorites
0,Juggalo Championsh#t Wrestling, vol. 2 is another great "wrestling" disc from the Insane Clown Posse.  The wrestling is terrible but the real highlight is the commentary from the boys (shaggy 2 dope and violent j).  The disc plays out as a parody of wrestling and their flea circus independent feds.  If you enjoy old school wrestling and it's fake history (kayfabe) then this disc is for you.  Not for children because the language is VERY salty.  Take a chance and laugh your butt off with volumes one, two and three of J.C.W.		Highly recommended.
0,Item as described and brand new. Lil Wayne has yet again wrote a great album. I recommend this to anyone
0,Mahler's 8th Symphony is also known as the Symphony of a Thousand, for the huge forces involved in performance.  The piece calls for an enormous orchestra with organ, 8 vocal soloists, and two adult choirs and a children's choir.  This Decca performance is conducted by Riccardo Chailly with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra who are among the very finest of Mahler interpreters. Although the forces involved are gigantic, Mahler does not continually overwhelm us.  There are moments of great delicacy also, all flavored with Mahler's characteristic sound.  Mahler uses the orchestra as a versatile tool and exploits all its sonic resources to the fullest.	In the Eighth, Mahler drastically reconceptualizes the symphony.  What for composers before him, from Haydn through Beethoven and Brahms, was essentially a matter of form--a sonata for orchestra, to be precise--Mahler reinvents as a matter or rhetoric.  In his previous symphonies he stretched the old idea of the symphony as far as it could go structurally, but in the Eighth he abandons all pretense at sonata form.  Instead, the Eighth is a unique dichotomy--two movements, seemingly diverse, but unified in both musical and dramatic themes.  (The astute Mahler fan will recognize similarities with themes from other of his symphonies, particularly and appropriately the Resurrection Symphony, Mahler's Second.)  The first movement of the Eighth is a setting of the Latin Prayer, Veni, creator spiritus; while the second is a setting, in German, of the final scene of Goethe's Faust, in which the soul of Faust ascends to heaven.  What do Faust and a Latin prayer have in common?  Importantly, the conclusion of Faust is not about his temptation, but about his salvation, and indeed, the "story" of that final scene, such as it is, is not a traditional drama of conflicts and events arising, but an ecstatic description of heavenly ascension through the redeeming power of love.  And it is love, the "eternal feminine" and the creator spirit, that unites the two texts.	The performances on this disc are mostly first rate.  The soloists are in particularly fine voice.  I have to admit to being a bit overwhelmed at times by the choral sopranos in the first movement, but otherwise I recommend this performance whole-heartedly as well worth repeated listening.
0,Electric Wizard is one of those bands that I just can't help but like. Normally, I don't fully get into the really slow doom rock that emerges from the "stoner rock" genre like Khanate but Electric Wizard just has a slew of dark, biting guitar riffs that make you wish you were the one who came up with it. "Let Us Prey" is a good balance of slow, heavy droning riffs that completely crush and more up-tempo bashing riffs that remind me of Cavity. A worthwhile export from across the band that I must see live.
0,A wonderful discount collection from the golden age of analog stereo recordings. Recorded in the mid 1950's these selections were considered "newer music" at the time, compared to the war horse selections in part 1 of this 2 box Romantic collection.		Standard Sony "Red Seal" reissue that expands on the material in the fantastic Livng Stereo Box set, though the remastering quality doesn't live up to that series.		The fold open box has 7 CDs with 440 minutes of music, in sleeves with recording dates in microprint near the copy right info. that's it, no liner notes or booklet in this discount set.		For the price it's a nice addition to the Living Stereo Munch RCA years on CD.		The recordings are mostly 5 star, but the lack of any notes or booklet make it a 4 star collection.
0,I loved this cd. joe was the best
0,I agree, this is the very best Tibetan chant cd there is.  My previous favorites were the releases by the Monks from Drepung Loseling, but here, their own chantmaster proves that sometimes a single minimal voice resonates deeper than many.		I am not the first to observe the similarities between Tibetan chant and the almost Zen state acheived by doom/drone bands like Sunn 0))).  For those coming from that angle, this is a perfect document to prove the point that such bands are only channelling the deep universal OM.  This is not only the best Tibetan Chant release available, but it is also one of the best pieces of music I have ever heard - truly profound.  The sound of Lama Tashi's voice is that of the emptiness uncovered in meditation.  Listen and live in the void.
0,The Sandi Patti "I" years, have a "Greatest Hits" album. Finest Moments brings together Sandi's best work from her most prolific decade in Christian Music. From start to finish, this album brings the best music from her finest albums from 1979 to 1989. By today's standards, this album is dated; hence Sandi changed her last name back to "Patty" in 1995. However, Sandi never fails to bring her fans the utmost best and this album does NOT disappoint. If you want a high powered album full of richly orchestrated songs, powerful lyrics that praise the power god, this is for you.
0,If you liked Dr. Dre's "The Chronic", then you'll LOVE this! This is Snoop's best album ever! The best songs are Gin & Juice, Lodi Dodi, Serial Killa, What's My Name, and Ain't No Fun! Every single rap fan  in the world needs The Chronic AND this in their collection!
0,i had no idea what it meant by Slipcase version... but the price was right so we purchased.  the slipcase is a neat feature, and we are glad we went with this seller.
0,I got this in 1998. One of those "Oh yeah!" things. Before getting it I only had "Play Deep" and "Diamond Days" in my collection. My "Voices of Babylon" was long gone, loaned out  years ago and not returned, and I had missed "Bangin'" and never  saw "Rockeye." This is a great compilation with many great tracks  re-mastered too (something that has yet to be done to the original  albums!)and a few extras. Great album!
0,This particular album is a jewel. It has always been underrated and under appreciated by fans and non fans. The musicianship the vocals and the sound quality is amazing and captures Reed and Cale at the top of their game. The only thing missing was Nico. When this came out I was working two jobs and didn't have time to listen to music like I do now. That's the only explanation I can think of, I never miss anything by John Cale.  Glad I found this. If you want some good Velvet LIVE sounds get this if you can. There's nothing like LIVE music when it's done well by a real band. I had to buy a used copy here on Amazon, it's evidently out of print. Hurry...		Thanks to LULU I have renewed respect for Lou Reed. Been going back and checking his past catalog with VU and solo. Some very good music that's unique. Lot of good music out there, enjoy it......
0,This music is so well done and funny, that when it disappeared last year, I had to reorder it for this year. It just would not be the same without it.
0,I just love Starcastle. Grew up listening to them. What a story, playing Top 40, disillusioned, started playing the prog they loved, and made a few amazing records before the record industry gave up on them.
0,I really enjoyed this recording.  The pianist has a nice touch and the engineers really conspired with the pianist to create a "dreamy" atmosphere.  It is kind of intoxicating and initially, very beautiful.		A person can really say that the Noctures are already pieces that really have a dreamy quality.  I cannot argue this, but compare this recording to Nelson Freire.  Freire does not capture (or perhaps intend to create this dreamy quality in all of the Nocturnes).		My only complaint is that this recording of Nocturnes ends up sounding like too much of the same thing.  It is an extremely beautiful disc to be lulled to sleep at bedtime.		For a more balance, perhaps too somber, but very beautiful rendition, try Arrau.  I believe that they are available as a Philips Twofer or in a five disc set of Chopin.  I must confess that I really love Arrau's versions of Chopin's works.
0,I purchased Gladys' last CD "Just for You" back in1994 when it was released and every track was breathtaking!!!!  I havewaited so long for her new album and with many delays in release, itis finally here!!  "At Last" is an absolutely provocative,gorgeous, emotional and one of her best recordings as a solo artist,if not her best!!!!!!!!  She is an extremely classy lady and throughmany ups and downs in her life has never shown so brightly!!  Everysong is a highlight but if I had to pick the top 4 tracks...they wouldgo as follows:	1. Just Take Me- A gorgeous ballad about love andrelationships!!  It brought me to tears the 1st time and I listen tothis track 3-4 times every day since buying the album! 2.  I Said YouLied- Another mid tempo song about relationships.  Very pretty songwith a powerful message! 3. Something Blue- A powerful song aboutlosing someone close to you and finding the strength to go on.  Shededicated it to her song.  Emotional song! 4. Do You Really Want ToKnow- Excellent song and also the debut song off the album!  Amidtempo groovy kind of track!	This Cd is amazing!  For anyone whowants to sit back and listen to a great R&B album that takes youto many levels, BUY THIS CD!!  The liner notes also say who each songis dedicated to!	Glady's I am so glad you are back "AtLast"!!!!
0,I've loved this album since it's release...I've said it before on NIN's other albums, but I'll say it again, if you became a fan with the release of Fragile, this might disappoint you a little. Only because it's from mid  90's and Fragile is more for 2000(now). NIN get's better as the years go  by, so keep that in mind! So, if your a true NIN fan, you have to buy it!  The tech and loudness of this CD is what I love, so if you don't like loud,  don't buy it! Trent your still amazing.....
0,I love the music that is coming from overseas and Khymera is one of the best.  Hard rock can't get much heavier and all along the songs have great melodies and vocals.  These guys a true musicians.
0,I know that many people will not appreciate Robert Johnson as much as I do, and the lack of production will just be a little too raw for most. But who said music needed production? If you beleive that over-producing music kills the heart and the soul, than you will enjoy throughly this collection. On the other hand, if you like your music to be more than a guy with his voice and a guitar, you probably won't listen to this everyday. However, it doesn't matter what side of the camp you are on, you must agree that this is an incredibly important footnote in music history. Without Johnson, modern blues and the British invasion (and probably rock 'n' roll as a whole) would've been inconceivable. Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, and many other acknowledged guitar virtuosos have proclaimed the genius of Johnson. There is a heart and soul rarely found in other music, a certain expression of all your pains and joys. It is, if you get past the minimalism, deeply affecting music. Johnson is to blues what Hank Williams is to country and Charlie Parker is to jazz. All lived for a very short time, but changed the genre forever (and all can be linked to helping invent rock 'n' roll). And if you claim to be a true music fan, a compilation of the previously mentioned artists should be found in your collection eventually. This is roots music at it's finest. Despite the fact it isn't listenable to everyone, you should try to listen to it at least once, to see where rock is all coming from.
0,Great CD. Has all the songs I grew up with, and they sound as good as ever. The CD arrived a few days after I ordered it, and is in good condition.
0,In receiving this album you'll be blessed with 16 classic rap tracks from probably the greatest of all time. It starts off with "I Can't Live Without My Radio", the first track off LL's debut "Radio". THEN you get the most famous line of old school rap:"LL Cool J is hard as HELL!" It really takes you back. LL goes hard on tracks like "I'm Bad", and on 1990's "Mama Said Knock You Out". He takes on Kool Moe Dee with the diss-fest "Jack the Ripper" and "Jinglin', Baby", where he tells Dee to "pass the wine cooler you big black....". Of course, no LL album is complete without the slow, affectionate songs dedicated to the ladies. The first is "I Need Love", his first hit to top the charts, then comes "Around the Way Girl", which is possibly the best hip-hop ballad of all time. Then, big L chills with the classic "Going Back to Cali" and then on the upbeat "Boomin' System", all jams full of life today. This album will be played over and over again, mainly for the variety you get. The only downside is that 1989's "I'm That Type of Guy" is missing, and it is sorely missed. But songs like "Big Ole' Butt" and "Back Seat" make up for the egotism displayed on that track. Don't miss it. Crank "Mama Said Knock You Out" and then decide who's the G.O.A.T. LL's been through more bull than any other rapper, and "All World" is just a start of what is to come.

She had a voice&was always good for my eye sight. i like her still.saw her new movie recently&was feeling Her new Irena Cara Hair.  Ce Ce was cool with dance music. She was like a cross between Irena Cara&Jody Watley&a few other folks.good music&good overview of her career.
0,Three great icons of American cinema were joined at the hip by the memory-saturated musical score that accompanied them. The Godfather films were expansive in many ways, but it ought not be forgotten that the music that framed them arguably lingers in our minds at least as long as the story's most compelling visual images.		Notwithstanding criticism of the City of Prague Orchestra's performance on this CD, I find this album a deeply satisfying revisitation of the Godfather phenomenon. The 'Godfather Waltz' and the 'Love Theme'--with their variations on the two themes--define the musical horizon here.		It is music that would not stand without the film, as is true of film music in general with few exceptions. Yet after recently watching the three films over the space of a few weeks, I find this performance of its sounds well worth the patience it requires to hear them again.		Scenes linger. Sounds endure. A great cinematic moment does that sort of thing.
0,Finally they got it right with the new recently released deluxe catalog of Jesus & Mary Chain.	I wasn't a fan of the previous release, the dual disc sets as it's easy to scratch one side of a disc and that could affect both sides since the label acts as a protective cover for the cd.	Now it seems more are taking the cues from Suede, their catalog has been the finest deluxe treatments yet,  each of the sets come with the full	album on disc 1, filled with b sides and demos from disc 1 to 2. The brits loved b-sides so there's always plenty of that action.	The 3rd disc is tv appearances and music videos.  Although, unlike the Suede sets, it would've been nice to include a complete concert of the band	during it's heyday.	The set is better on these than ever before, well since the vinyl came out at least.	Well done and more need to come out in this format !
0,Just glorious...this is one of the best up-tempo CDs EVER.  I can't believe this CD has passed me by for so long.  It's better than I could have expected from Human League.  WOW!  The beats grab you and never let go and still infuse some great melodies.
0,"Miles Ahead," one of the finest collaborations between Miles Davis and Gil Evans, is one of those CDs you can play any time, and love it just as much the hundredth time you hear it as the first. Evans' imaginative arrangements, moving fluidly between the jagged and the mellow, caress Davis' cool, laconic trumpet the way Nelson Riddle's arrangements caress Sinatra's voice. The ten tunes on this CD are played as one continuous skein of music, progressing from the propulsive excitement of "Springsville" to the mellow beauty of "The Maids of Cadiz" and "My Ship," the piquant wit of "New Rhumba" and the infectious good humor of "I Don't Wanna Be Kissed (By Anyone But You)." For anyone who loves Miles Davis, this CD is essential, and for anyone who loves the sound of a big band playing cool jazz, this is a total delight.
0,the songs are great history lessons And I have learn quite  a lot from them . And they have catcy tunes
0,Musiq's new CD is fantastic effort. Even though his music has generally maintained the same format, there are some slight differences with this CD than his previous ones. It seems as if he went for more of an orchestrated feel with this one. In many songs, there are quite a but of this. And it works out really well. There are a lot of strong tracks on here. My favorite tracks are "moment in life" w/Kindred and Cee-Lo, "womanopoly" and "infatueighties". There's pretty much only one song I can't stand and that is "miss you". And there's another song that I'm indifferent about, so this prohibits me from giving it a perfect 5 stars, but this is nothing but quality and I would definitely recommend it to most fans of R&B and Hip-Hop. At least those who aren't swayed by most of the mainstream trash that they hear on the radio.
0,"~Much better than "Welcome to Earth."  7 (so named because it is the seventh APB release) grabs you immediately with it's unabashed usage of the Tocata and Fugue in D minor and the Carmina Burrana (which is  usually _soooo_ cliche, but this time it works) and doesn't let go."~  this album is the classic "Mourn," the single for which is their  best work.  There are effectively 12 songs on the album, though, as two are  hidden after periods of silence on track 9, and one with it's own track  after that (the final was remixed quite well on the Mourn EP)
0,If you are a true 2Pac fan this CD will not disappoint you as you listen and remember the art of a gifted artist.
0,This brilliant recording is equal parts pop, folk, and storytelling. The pop hooks are inescapable: you'll be soaked with a variety of keyboard and xylophonic bubbles then dried softly by girlish vocals in the epic mineral bath that is "Detroit, Lift Up...". You're drenched in a similar melodic downpour, then blown clean by fresh guitar lines and crisp tap-a-tap-tap drumming in "All Good Naysayers...". The folksy sounds of the banjo permeate a number of tracks as well, but it has wandered over the fence fits right along side the pop keyboard and xylophone hooks and soft well groomed vocal arrangements. The storytelling is undeniable; I don't know the background but the whole album first exposes this with the titles of the songs each representing areas of the Great Lake state both obscure and known. Inside the travelers postcard style album are lyrics swirling around  the tales of personalities real or imagined (I'm not sure which) emerge. This is not found music in the normal sense; its not sample or glitch at all, but there is this feeling permeating the recording that the inspirations were not made up but found through observation and experience, and these now stand as a testament to that end. My personal favorite is probably "The Upper Peninsula" a soft and unforgettable dirge lamenting a broken down small down Michigan resident ( "I live in a trailer home, with a snowmobile, my car / The window is broken out and the interstate is far" ... "I lost my mind, I lost my life / I lost my job, I lost my wife" ). Sufjan has a true talent wherein he can tell these kind of stories, disguising the bluntness of the messages with a soft delivery and complex, textured arrangement of light instrumentation. Listen to the album, fall in love with the music, its ok to float away on some of those pop updrafts... but take time to absorb the nod to true Americana folk storytelling.
0,I am not one to write a review when so many people have already said so much (and they are all spot on) but there was something I needed to add here. This was the first Junior Kimbrough album I bought and it blew me away. I love Junior Kimbrough's brand of punk blues. Enjoying this collection prompted me to pick up all his other works (6 CDs in all) and they were all worth it. What I'm getting to, in a roundabout way, is that not all Junior's albums are represented on this collection. His two earliest Do the Rump and All Night Long seem to be left off of this collection, or at least the versions of songs from those albums. It is worth your money to buy this as a starter but I deplore you not to stop there pick up Junior's other works- he really deserves the spotlight which he has never gotten.
0,Suzanne Vega returns with a great cd.  Many songs stand out in my mind but  most of all the single " Caramel."  This song from " The  Truth About Cats and Dogs" soundtrack has a jazz influence to it and  is  a highlight on this cd.  Other highlights is "World Before  Columbus" written for her daughter, Ruby.  I also enjpy  "Honeymoon Suite" a song that seems to tell a story about her  husband, Mitchell Froom, and his contact with the spiritual world.  This CD  is a must for any Suzanne Vega.
0,This is the first Lil Jon CD I ever bought.  It won't be the last.  I'm trying to find them all, now.  "Kings of Crunk" is without a doubt the best CD I've purchased in the past two years--maybe longer.  For me, it's hard to admit that.  I usually only dig songs produced by DJ Paul or Juicy J of Three Six Mafia.  In fact, it was "Move B*tch" (the collab between Lil Jon and Three Six) that got me interested in hearing more Lil Jon.  I am amazed by the beats on this CD.  Listening to the radio will give you a distorted opinion of Lil Jon's music.  It's not all about call-and-response and club anthems.  Some songs go way beyond just chanting.  In particular, I'm in love with "Rep Yo City", "Knockin Heads", "BME Click", "Keep Yo Chullin Out the Street", "Don't Give A F", "Push That N"... and on and on.  Lil Jon displayed a lot of versatility with the production on the CD with tracks that reminded me of production that might come from Organized Noise, Too Short, Pimp C, or DJ Paul.  This is a superb CD, and I'd encourage anyone to by it.
0,Well it's about time! ... Finally KD&L's follow-up to Smoking in Heaven ... 12 great songs delivered in their own unique style ... standouts include Baby Bye Bye(don't miss the strange video), Bitchin' in the Kitchen, Whiskey, Whenever You See Me .... and song that has me reaching for the replay button the most, No Action! ... the rest of the tracks are great as well! ... it was worth the wait! ... Can't wait till I get my vinyl copy and their show at the El Rey in April! ...... hope they don't wait 3 years for the next album!
0,Wonders is another classic Piano Guys album, full of interesting arrangements and amazing artistry. I love their music, pure and simple. At  first listen I was not as sure I would like it as well as the others I have, but by the third time through it became my favorite. It is a good thing they are not on viny; I would have worn it out by now.
0,In spite of the thin sound, this is a good listening experience overall, but these NYPO recordings are clearly surpassed by the early 60's Columbia Symphony Orchestra Brahms cycle.  All four of the CSO stereo performances (from Walter's post heart attack "indian summer") are definitive, simply the best ever, by anybody.  That also goes for the Haydn Variations and the overtures.		If you want the best, get the CSO set (also on CBS/Sony).
0,I love all the twilight soundtracks, but this one is amazing.  I love all the different styles all coming together making a perfect album.
0,Where were you on Sunday February the 9th 1964, the Ed Sullivan Shoe.....It's the BEATLES!!!!! You had better get one of these...soon! You'll love it too!!
0,Great great journey again by Gregory ...
0,My first experience with David Lindley was about fifteen years ago in San Diego. My cousin and I drove to Solana Beach and saw him at the Belly Up. He can, and does play almost anything. I guess "Brother John" is my favorite as well as "Tuberculucas and the Sinus Blues". I will see him again if I can ever escape Grover Beach.
0,The Chi-Lites are a fantastic soul group with sky high heavenly harmony and a wonderful, make-you-melt falsetto/tenor by Eugene Record.  1972's A Lonely Man is the epitome of soft, ballad soul.  I love the strings and sweet melody of all the songs here.  Each song is a winner, and there are a few here that are among my favorite soul jams all together.  "Oh Girl" is one of those emotionally charged ballads that will make you tear up, even the hardest of the hard will well up to this one.  The song shows the vulnerability of a man who worries about a woman leaving him and what he would do if she did.  I love the harmonica, which adds to the emotional depth of the song.  "A Lonely Man" is one of those 6 minute ballads that will also melt your heart, and perfectly exemplifies the perfect vocal harmony.  This song is a little similar in tone and vibe to "Have You Seen Her" (1971) with the harmony and balladry of the song.  "Love Is" is a song defining the aspects of true love based on how people act, yet again another beautiful jam.  A noticeable difference between this and the previous album, 1971's (For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People" is that there is less upbeat funk here, and more balladry (I am more of a fan of ballad/soft soul FYI: though that other album is another winner IMO).  Any one who loves the Delfonics (my fav group), The Stylistics, The Spinners.... will absolutely love the Chi-Lites.  This album definitely shows a soul group at its best.  This remaster cd is well-done with awesome sound quality.  This record showcases an immensely talented group from Chicago.  It will remind you of the ballad soul of Philly soul.  I guess most people who grew up in the 70's to the soul explosion probably already have had the album for decades and loved it, but young people could definitely groove to this classy soul.  From the mind of a young 20 something, your parents and elders DO know what great music really is.  For any hip-hop heads out there, Paul Wall, a Houston rapper, has a laid back song called "Girl" which samples "Oh Girl."
0,The Rising, Bruce Springsteen's first album with the E Street Band since the 1984 landmark album Born in the USA, is a blazing return to form. His vocals are pure, intense, and emotional, sounding better than they have in years. The E streeters have fallen directly back in step with Bruce seeming to have not skipped a beat in their decade and a half away from Mr. Springsteen. It is easy to see the maturity of the band, as they have evolved their sound for a new musical climate without forgetting the elements that defined their sound when they first got together over 25 years ago. The album showcases very solid guitar work, including some incredibly roaring solos and leads from Bruce himself, wailing away on his Telecaster. There are a wide variety of songs represented here, as well as many different musical styles. There are straight up rockers, more laid back ballads, some excellent slide guitars, and even some middle eastern sounds reminiscent of recent work by Sting. Some of my personal favorites are Lonesome Day, Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin), Further on up the Road, and The Rising. The album is filled with songs of loss and redemption, friendships and hardships. This skillful blending of emotions fills the music with added sense of reality that makes it that much more meaningful. This is a real man with real emotions that people can relate to. While watching VH1 recently, a Michael Jackson fan said that there were two types of rock stars: those like Springsteen who are very approachable people that often go out to local clubs and meet with everyday people, and those like Jackson, who seem like untouchable people that lead very guarded lives, on a completely different level than you and me. He said that is "untouchable" status was what drew him to Jackson. Springsteen's approachable nature, t-shirt and jeans appearance, and abilty to relate to the feeling of everyday people are what draw myself and many others to listen to his music. Give this album a try. It is one of the most powerful statements in this post 9/11 world (not to sound to cliched, but I really do think it's a powerful album from a man who realizes that our world has changed). Hope you enjoy listening to this album as much as I do. I already posted this review under for limited edition (the version I own) For those of you who are wondering, the limited edition is a bound cardboard booklet containing about 45 pages of handwritten lyrics and pictures. It's not absolutely essential for everyone, but if you're a Springsteen fan, the handwritten lyrics are a very nice touch.
0,IVE LOOKED DOWN THE BARREL OF THIS GUN, AND IT WAS FUN! THIS CD IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT AND INFLUENCIAL PIECE OF MUSIC IN THE RAP SCENE, AS WELL AS ENDTRODUCING OF COURSE. TO ANYONE WITHOUT THIS CD THAT LISTENS TO GOOD MUSIC, OR MUSIC FOR THAT MATTER, THIS CD SHOULD BE SITTING NEXT TO YOUR BIBLE AS JUST AS IMPORTANT PIECE OF HISTORY.
0,Barry Manilow choose the best songs of the 50s for this cd, in my opinion.  So easy to listen to,  lots of great memories in this cd. Highly recommend this to everyone.

0,Al Green has long been on the periphery of artists that I "keep meaning to add" to my collection, but never have. I think we all have that sort of situation where there's an artist or group that we know should by all rights be in our music collection, but we keep putting it off for various reasons. Now I wonder what took me so long; this disc is a must.		Starting off with the earnest and exciting "Tired of Being Along", the disc proceeds on to a dream mix tape of Al's best: "Still In Love With You", "Let's Stay Together", "Here I Am (Come And Take Me)". But the real joy is in tunes that I wasn't aware of before: "Love and Happiness", "Call Me", "Let's Get Married", and "L-O-V-E" (which has been present on various mix tapes I've made since), among others. All the songs in one way or another add to the collection and the flow of the songs is nice and non-chronological, but more selected for the ultimate flow that is produced.		This is my first Al Green purchase, and it will not be my last. This is as good a place to start as any, and you won't be able to imagine what kept you from getting it in the first place.
0,In my lifetime the number of performers deemed necessary to perform Bach's major choral works has shrunk from a fairly mammoth scale to almost nothing.  Now, while I accept the authenticists' arguments about contemporary performing practice, I am still left with a niggling feeling that the sheer scale and grandeur of Bach's inspiration and conception has been short-changed by the rigorous, somewhat puritanical application of these theories.  I am not pleading for a return to the serried ranks of the Huddersfield Choral Society in their heyday - those sort of numbers certainly do muddy the waters of Bach's thrilling counterpoint.  Nevertheless, at the back of my mind lies a strong suspicion that at the back of Bach's mind when he was writing these works lay a sound that was fuller and richer than we get from Andrew Parrott and the leanest of forces on these discs of the great B Minor Mass.  (I admit I am a little less worried as it applies to the Passions which could be argued to benefit from a more intimate scale - though even there the choruses for the `turba' seem a little sparse for a crowd baying for blood as in the `Kreuzige, kreuzige' chorus from the John Passion.)		Certainly we know that contemporaries like Handel would pretty much take as many singers as they could get for any given performance of their choral works.  Pragmatism like that applied to performances from the time of the Tudor and Renaissance church composers and were still necessary even for the supremely demanding Wagner who was frequently seeking to fill out the string sections of his orchestras with extra players.  Did Bach really conceive the grand moments of the Mass - the Gratias agimus, the Credo, the Sanctus or the final Dona nobis pacem - with such a lean choral sound in mind, despite the added glories of trumpets and drums?  Even quieter moments like the wonderful, mystical harmonies of the Et incarnatus or the heartbreaking, shifting harmonies of the Crucifixus with its amazing cadence and transition to the burst of joy of Et resurrexit seem a bit undernourished with such a small group of singers.		Having said that, the singers here are an impressive array of specialist performers, led by the likes of Emma Kirkby, Rogers Covey-Crump and David Thomas.  I certainly have no quibble with the use of `authentic' singing techniques in Baroque music.  The additional purity of intonation, the lack of Romantic appurtenances that they bring to a performance benefits this kind of music no end.  And these are all - even the altos of the Tolzer Boys' Choir - top-notch interpreters of this music.  I'm a little less happy about the direction of Andrew Parrott, though.  In his efforts to remain true to a performing practice that eschewed modern over-interpretation, he ends up being a little four-square and plain-Jane.  Certainly compared to John Eliot Gardiner's classic recording for Archiv.  There, I think, you will find the best of period performance.  The choir is large enough to give the necessary gravitas to the grander movements.  And there is terrific lift and ebullience to Gardiner's rhythms in the faster movements (e.g. the Gloria, Cum Sancto Spiritu, Et expecto, etc.)  It's not a matter of tempi - they are, for the most part, pretty similar in both performances - it's a more a question of (dare I say) spirit.		In summary, I would still choose Gardiner as the performance I return to most.  However, at such a seriously low price, the Parrott is worth exploring if you want to hear for yourself the strictest period performance theories put into practice.
0,I have been a fan of Karen and Richard Carpenter since the beginning.  Decided to toss the long playing records and cassette tapes and buy the current re-mastered compact disks.  They do not disappoint.  Karen's voice is as sweet as ever.  I doubt that the music sounded this good on the original LPs.
0,Great
0,great Scorpions album !
0,Music labels that force artists to only release songs that they feel will help sell the artists "brand"  and be "hits" make it impossible to hear just how talented the person behind the song really is.  I bought Pink's first album back in the day and really didn't like it.  It wasn't until I watched one of her concerts on TV and saw her voice is incredible and unique.  Her first album did not sound anything like what Pink is able to belt out and that's an injustice! It's hard to find true artists that have talent oozing out of them. Thankfully she didn't give up and released albums where she had more creative control.	This album makes feel every emotion she must feel when writing or singing the songs. I cried, I danced, I felt invincible, and songs on this album should've been on her first album.
0,I can't really say anything that hasn't been said here already.  Long Live The Kane is a classic.  Hands down.  Point blank.  Period.  The lyrics were unlike anything that had been heard at the time and the beats were most definitely on point.  At the time, sampling didn't require clearance (which would change later that year), so DJs/Producers were able to freely sample and the creative sounds of '88 were unlike any other year.  Marley Marl most definitely hooked Kane up on this joint.  "On The Bugged Tip", "Ain't No Half Steppin", "Raw (Remix)", "Set It Off", and "Just Rhymin' With Biz" are all classic joints.  In fact, every song on the album is dope.  Man, albums like this really make me long for the days of '88 again.		I have to disagree with some of these reviewers that say there is no filler on this album.  "The Day You're Mine" could be considered filler when you examine the content of the rest of the album.  But with cats like LL, Slick Rick, and Heavy D dropping classic joints for the ladies at the time, you could say that this was the trend at the time.  Don't get me wrong, it's not wack......I'm just saying that it could be considered as filler because the rest of the album is centered around Kane getting busy on the mic.		Long Live The Kane is still a 5 star classic.  It's been dissected, copied, examined, and used as a blueprint for hundreds of MCs that followed.  Not many rap albums are as heavily sampled as this one.  The beats are on point and the lyrics are timeless.  Long Live The Kane is a must have album.  It simply gets no better than this.  Highly reccomended.		Standout Tracks: Every Track Stands Out
0,Jeff Lynne is a musical genius. I first heard this 'album' in 1976. It was my first boyfriend's album. I instantly loved it. It is like a work of one of the great classic composers. I have bought this 'album' in vinyl,8 track, cassette and CD through the years! I have gifted it. Just perfection down to every note, beat, transition...just perfect. I always wonder if Lynne would be hard to work for! LOL  Favorite: Waterfall, I think!
0,With twenty-two greatest love songs of all-time interpreted by the greatest singing icon, the legendary, the one and only Mr. Frank Sinatra, you can never go wrong with this CD.  It's a musical treasure of a lifetime.		To quote what was written on the liner notes, "Frank Sinatra believed that an artist is as good as his material, and he considered himself to be among the luckiest people in the world to have been able to make a career out of what he loved to do - to interpret wonderful music."  Indeed, his material in this CD is so wonderful and very impressive, songs penned and composed by famous songwriters, the likes of Glenn Miller/Mitchell Parish's "Moonlight Serenade," Gershwin Brothers' I've Got A Crush On You," Cole Porter's "Night And Day," "What Is This Thing Called Love," "Easy To Love" and "In The Still Of The Night,"  Sammy Cahn/Jim Van Heusen's "All The Way," Harold Arlen/Johnny Mercer's "Come Rain Or Come Shine," Ray Noble's "The Very Thought Of You," Jerome Kern/Dorothy Fields' "The Way You Look Tonight," Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart's "My Funny Valentine," Ned Washington/George Bassman's "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You," to mention some of the nicest songs in this CD.		According to Frank Sinatra, "it takes a long time to heal a broken heart, he understands that playing one of his albums can help."  I totally agree with him.  One can just imagine the many wonders that music can do to us.  Well, this is just one of his many bestseller CDs that I'd love to listen to.  I could listen to Sinatra's music forever and enjoy every moment of it.		The most remarkable tracks for me are the ones that were arranged by Nelson Riddle ("Moonlight Serenade," "I've Got A Crush On You," "The Way You Look Tonight,""You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me," "My Funny Valentine" and "Like Someone In Love"); Johnny Mandel ("Easy To Love," "You And The Night And The Music," "Let's Fall In Love," "In The Still Of The Night") ; Quincy Jones with Count Basie Orchestra ("Fly Me To The Moon") and Don Costa ("Night And Day" and "Come Rain Or Come Shine").		This CD is a collector's item.  I highly recommended it and will be a wonderful addition to your Frank Sinatra collection.
0,This recording is the second of two recordings of Faust with the same three principals and the same conductor. The only difference of the two is that the first recording of 1953 is in a mono sound but with an excellent Valentine in Jean Borthayre. While the second	Studio performance was recorded in an excellent stereo sound. All of the performers are in their prime. Victoria de Los Angeles as	Marguerite is a possessor of a beautiful cream e voice ,which she which she uses it to perfection. In the third act ,in her song "There once was a King of Thule" her singing being beautiful is very nostalgic while in the jewel aria "What is this I see" she is naive and very excited. This is great characterization on her part. In the long duet with Nicolai Gedda she blends her voice beautifully with his. As Faust Nicolai Gedda a possessor of beautiful lyric tenor sings marveoleusly like a young men who is in love.	The third character ,The great Boris Christoff is magnificent  in the role of Mephistopheles. His voice is beautiful ,very expressive ,full of splendid colors. In his book " The Grand Tradition" John Steane wrote: with Christoff there is immediate presence ,more strongly satanic and exotic ,soon to be recognized as more vivid and varied. One sees his smile ,shares his fun ,knows exactly when he has arrived at the Kermesse -he never needs to announce " Mei voici " again. Ernest Blanc as Valentine sings also	Beautifully,but I prefer the singing and characterization of Jean Borthayre from the earlier recording of 1953 .	Liliane Berton as Siebel and Rita Gorr as Marthe are also distinguished artist's portraying their roles beautifully.	Conductor Andre Cluytens a master of all musical styles leads an excellent chorus and orchestra of Theatre National de L 'Opera with great spirit and precision. To my knowledge this is the best recording of Faust currently available ,and I recommend it	 To every ,music lover ,who enjoys great opera- at it's very best.	To music enthusiast's who would like to hear a recording of Faust ,sung by French singers  in a French style I recommend as a second choice the 1931 studio recording with Mireille Berthn, Cesar Vezzani,Marcel Journet conducted by Henri Buser.
0,I must take the strongest exception to the review written by Ray Liikanen.  Because he personally prefers Barenboim's recording is no reason to leave a one star review.  This is one of the finest recordings of these three sonatas in existance, in both technical and interpretive respects.  The Appassionata in particular is outstanding, the final coda will leave you breathless; Serkin's expressiveness, power, and technical mastery are second to none.  The production of the recording itself my have what some perceive to be flaws, such as the occasionaly audible creak of the bench as Serkin moves, but I find these very human and charming, and far preferable to the sterile pefection of music that sounds as if it were recorded in a vacuum.  Serkin also takes exactly the right amount of artistic license with the music, never indulging in excessive histrionics, yet instilling sublime emotion into every note.  This recording has the feel of a masterwork: Commanding and confident, yet beautiful and intimate.  No praise is too high for Serkin.
0,I just got into the Brass this year and of the several albums and reissue CDs I acquired, this is the absolute BEST.  Every track is great and the playing is uniformly excellent.
0,This album was the best that Tyrese has made. I loved it. I can tell that he put his all into this cd. All of his tracks were nice, but my favorites were #4 Make Up Your Mind, #7 I'm Sorry, #8 What Am I Gonna Do and #12 Housekeepin'. I really liked track 12 Housekeepin'.  This cd is what I call good music.......
0,An album entirely of covers?  Well, I've mentioned before I'm not the biggest fan of cover songs, and an entire album of them is usually too much, however this one is pretty solid thanks to Laura Nyro's vocals and Patti LaBelle's contributions.		"Nowhere to Run" is a perfect example of two amazing singes combining to create a great version of a classic.  From the first note this song has a certain memorable and frantic pace that's hard to resist.  "It's not love I'm running from, it's the heartbreak I know will come".  Great lyric!  The "No no, ain't got nowhere to run to, no no, ain't got nowhere to hide" part is pretty good with the piano chugging along, though perhaps a couple minutes of it is a bit overlong.		"Dancing In the Street" has never been one of my favorites, but it's different when an exceptionally soulful singer like Laura Nyro sings it I suppose.  This is probably my favorite version.  Yup I'd go *that* far to proclaim such a statement!  "Monkey Time", which opens this two-part tune, is even better  "Are you ready, say are you ready?" but "Dancing In the Street" is the greater focus here.  "Don't forget the Motor City!"  This version just takes having fun to a higher level, perhaps that's why I like it so much.		Huh, I didn't know "You've Really Got a Hold On Me" was originally a Smokey Robinson tune.  I've always associated it as a Beatles classic.  This version's okay but it doesn't quite have the emotion of Lennon singing it.  However I definitely enjoy the surprise factor of it speeding up during the "Hold me baby don't turn me loose" and "oh cuz I love you" part in the second half!		Wow the intro to "It's Gonna Take a Miracle" is superb!  Again the combination of two great singers in Laura Nyro and Patti LaBelle makes it stand out in a really powerful way.  "You took your love and left me quite by surprise, you can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle, yes it's gonna take a miracle to make me love someone new 'cuz I'm crazy for you" is a very pretty and calm way to wind a fantastic song.  "The Bells" is a soothing piece of soul.  "Do you hear what I hear when your lips are kissing mine?"  The melody gets a little wishy washy at times, but otherwise it's okay.		"Up on the Roof" has a great opening line.  "When this old world starts getting me down and people are too much for me to take, up on the roof I climb right up to the top of the stairs, and all my cares just drift right into space".  We all need our place away from the world right?  I think I know this song, but remember the other version being more energetic.  Either way Laura sings another amazing vocal performance.  Laidback and pretty is the best way to describe this.		Oh hey I know "Spanish Harlem" but can't recall who sings the other versions I've heard.  The vocals are higher pitched here, but it works just as well as the other versions.  Then again I might be getting the "la la la's" mixed up with another song.  If so, oops!  "There is a rose in Spanish Harlem, a red rose up in Spanish Harlem, it is a special one, it's never seen the sun, it only comes out when the moon is on the run, and all the stars are gleaming, it's growing in the street right up through the concrete, but soft and sweet and dreaming".  Nice!		"The Wind" opens eerily with the quietest organs you'll ever hear.  You probably think the vocals will suddenly get loud but no!  Laura continues to sing quietly.  ""When the cold summer wind sends a chill down my spine, and I long for my lover deep within, I know he has gone though my love lingers on in a dream that the wind blows to me".  Wow this song is incredibly pretty once again!  There's something special about the carefully executed way this song flows.  "I remember the wind in the cool summer night as he lay warm and tender in my arms" sounds so good!		"I Met Him on a Sunday" opens with handclaps and a quiet melody.  I feel like magic happens when Laura and Patti sing together, and the "whooooas" in between the vocals is great.  Not much to the melody but there doesn't need to be.  The lyrics are awesome too- "Well I met him on a Sunday, and I missed him on a Monday, well I found him on Tuesday, and I dated him Wednesday, and I kissed him on Thursday, and he didn't come Friday, when he showed up Saturday I said "Bye bye baby".  lol.		"Desiree" is another soft tune.  The piano is on the loungy side but the organs enhance it.  "Aint Nothing Like the Real Thing" is just some piano fiddling and short vocals, but doesn't last long enough to go anywhere.  Time for some upbeat fun.  That's why I saved "Jimmy Mack" for close to the end, haha!  I knew it just had to be upbeat.  It's very comparable to the original in terms of how soulful it is, and that's a great thing.  Who remembers singing this song with their parents?  "Hey Jimmy, Jimmy!  Oh Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back.  Jimmy, Jimmy!  Oh Jimmy Mack you better hurry back".		Ah, let's see how this version of "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" stands alongside Carole King's version since the two having singing voices that resemble each other at times.  This should be interesting!  It... might surpass it.  Yup!  It just might.  I admit as a teenager, a teenage boy, I never cared for this song because it was just too female-y!  However I really love the verse melody and never realized as a teen how enjoyable it is, even if the chorus didn't appeal to me.  "When my soul was in the lost and found you came along to claim it".  I think the verse melody is better than Carole King's version, but Carole King has the better chorus.  Carole just sings it with much more convincing power.  Then we factor in Aretha Franklin's version which is probably the best one of all.		"O-o-h Child" can't hold a candle to the original since it's just not soulful enough, however it's okay.  I understand Laura Nyro's not necessarily trying to out-soul other singers and is going for a more piano-focused version anyway.  Overall highly impressive for a cover album.
0,This is one of the most satisfying collections of Beethoven Sonatas, and I have several complete collections.  However, there is something magical about O'Conor's interpretations.  First there is the technical command and beautiful tonal qualities of his skills as a sensitive pianist.  Then there is the expressive qualities of his approach to the sonatas and his deep knowledge of the scores.  You cannot go wrong with this set --the Telarc sound and piano enhance the performance.
0,The songs on this CD are countless emotions, I highly recommend it.
0,I first encountered most of the songs from this album on a compilation album DO THE STANLEY which appeared in 1975. I was fresh out of college, recently disappointed in love, and enduring a gig as an actor participating in 30 min adaptations of Shakespeare that were performed in down and out areas of communities who treated us with suspicion, indifference, and hostility. I was really bummed out and thought that things couldn't get worse. They did. I was in an automobile accident that nearly killed me.		But in this darkest hour of my life came STACKRIDGE with their songs of innocence, fun, and a world of their own which totally captivated me and helped to lift my spirits enormously. The song GREASEPAINT SMILES from their next album EXTRAVAGANZA became my official theme song and helped me through the rough times ahead. I went out and bought every STACKRIDGE album I could get my hands on. Of course it was disappointing to learn that just as I had discovered them they stopped performing but as one of the group's singles succinctly put it, C'EST LA VIE. The original incarnation of the band (Albums STACKRIDGE, FRIENDLINESS, and THE MAN IN THE BOWLER HAT) described these albums as "children's favorites with attitude". They appeal to the child in all of us and it is that which makes the group and their music so special.		Needless to say I survived and eventually prospered and now have children who listen to STACKRIDGE and especially this album. For beginners this is the best place to start. Songs like THE ROAD TO VENEZUELA and THE GALLOPING GAUCHO contain not only catchy melodies but pointed observations as well. Their childlike qualities come through best in THE INDIFFERENT HEDGEHOG while DANGEROUS BACON contains their social observations. Sir George Martin (of BEATLES fame) produced this album, giving it his special layered touch that has you coming back again and again to catch all the subtleties. All 5 of the STACKRIDGE albums between 1971 and 1976 are worth your while so start collecting now before they disappear. As Jim "Crun" Walter longtime bassist with the group observed, "Rock and Roll it ain't but then Stackridge came from Bristol (U.K.) not Memphis".

0,I have to say that I was floored by this new Josh Groban CD...FLOORED !! I have the previous two, and the growth displayed in this new one is hard to measure. The courage it must have take for him to leave the familiar and comfortable world of the 'safe' and venture into S.A. music (Weeping), the world of funk and groove (the Herbie Hancock offering), the etherial and haunting Now or Never with Imogen Heap (!!!) and his own February Song, it's hard to fathom. And beyond the wonderful orchestrations and interesting melodic twists, he also revisits one of his strongest suits, interpreting romantic and often sad ballads in Spanis and Italian.  The future is so bright for this artist I can't imagine where he'll be in 10 years, but I hope it's Broadway, but only after he conquers the world. Nobody I've ever followed as a musician works as hard as this man does to bring this unique style and open emotional 'converstation' with his listening public (and he has a huge one already).  Bravo Mr. Groban and don't change a thing, you're on the right track, your OWN track and I cannot wait to see where it takes you, and us your avid listening public.		Favorites?  February Song, L'ultima Notte, Lullaby/Weeping, Machine and definitely Now or Never with a bullet !
0,Love it
0,Nevermore doesn't mess around when it comes to making albums, either studio or live. I have a minor complaint and that is the song "Poison Godmachine" is not included on this live album. it is good to see them come back with a live album after 3 years of not making an album. this band goes by the adage "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger". one of the band members is in the hospital with end stage kidney failure, but the band is still alive and kicking.
0,I love about two thirds of this. Nothing wrong with any of it. It's just the way I feel about all of his live stuff. I am not a fan of any of the crude humor or anti-God stuff. But the rest of this is some of the greatest and most intense music I've ever heard. Absolutely smoking. No overdubs either. WOW!
0,i'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get an inexpensive taste for faure's music.  The recordings are decent, and the selection is interesting.  After this, check out his nocturnes for piano and of course the Requiem.
0,I echo what other reviewers have already said: this AF Gold disc is fantastic! The bass just about knocked me out of my chair.	Using Windows Media Player 11 on Windows 7 (64 bit OS), with an installed 24-bit HDCD capable Creative Labs sound card (model Xtreme-Fidelity), and Creative Labs 7.1 surround sound speakers.
0,There are some interesting songs on this album, but it doesn't get much airtime in my rotation.  I like some of what was done with this remix album, but it is not completely good.  I prefer the other Ozric Tentacles that I own, and can recommend them to you.  They are Erpland, Jurassic Shift, Strangeitude, Pungent Effulgent, and Curious Corn.  You can't go wrong with those.
0,This album, Etheridge's first release, is the barest, truest example of raw power on 12 strings.  Limited overdubs, recorded primarily live and released to critical review in 1989, this debut album showcases the songwriting and musical foundation that would bring Melissa such fame in the early 90s.	Initially, I bought this album for the cover.  On vinyl, no less. It was one of the first CDs I purchased when I converted.	A reviewer below commented on the production values for this album, that they aren't up to the expected standard.  I think this roughness lends more depth to the deep passion of this album as a body of work.  It also enhances the texture of the heart-rendering "Watching You".	Hard-core Melissa fans will have had this album in their collection in several formats for years.  Newcomers should include this debut release as the essential Melissa it is.  Melissa at her best is herself, a guitar, a bass and a drumset. Stripped down to these elements from the sound effects, orchestration and overdubs, the listening can appreciate the essense of Etheridge's songcraft, including interludes of her and her guitar alone.
0,They've been called the best guitar band on the planet. Musically I consider them "the Sun, while all others are merely shadows." With that said, know that this is a review by, singularly, the biggest CHURCH fan in the known universe (and maybe beyond). This loose, improvisational offering does not disappoint the faithful, as Marty and Peter weave their usual virtual cornucopia of sonic tapestries in and out of each other over Steve's thoughtful lyrics. Tim has captured one of his best snare sounds ever! As stated above, this is more of a relaxed, free, though at times, structured "jam", which is why the unusual directions some of the material takes works so well. I question whether or not they would have captured something so creative, albeit atypical, if they had thought it out more, recorded demos, polished it in pre-production, then committed it to digital memory. In a recent interview the members spoke of the virtues of being an independent band and the fact that they, and their company, feel comfortable releasing BACK WITH TWO BEASTS proves that. I cannot find an unworthy track on this recording, but the standouts thus far are SNOWFALLER and PANTECHNICON. I highly recommend this to all fans of the band, yet for someone interested in exploring THE CHURCH I would suggest you start with, again, what some critics have called their "near flawless" works: HEYDAY, STARFISH. In addition to those I would advocate acquisition of REMOTE LUXURY, THE BLURRED CRUSADE, HOLOGRAM OF BAAL, and, what the group once considered their best, PRIEST = AURA. From there the veritable plethora of solo and side projects is also more than worthwhile. Balthazar says, "Give it a listen." Be well, as "It's something quite peculiar... something shimmering and bright... it leads you here despite your destination... under the Milky Way tonight."
0,I have recently rediscovered this hidden jewel from deep in my collection of 3,000+ albums on CD & Vinyl and I just can't stop listening to this album like 3+ times a day. It's just really beautiful and powerful. For whatever reason, I've never given this album much attention. I dug out my Tool CDs from their rack the other day and after playing them all I thought what the heck, I'll give APC another chance. I'm glad I did. This album is truly incredible and after reading the background story behind it all on Wikipedia it all came together for me. It sounds great anywhere but if you are blessed to have a decent system and decent headphones/speakers you are in for a treat. It is lush to say the least. WOW : )
0,What a great musician, I've never seen anyone play a Mandolin like this man! Totally enjoyed him at Floyd Fest this year!!
0,im a huge fan so i love love this cd she really belts it out here her ballads are her best in this cd
0,Although Soft Machine weren't huge sellers, there were several reissues of this album on vinyl. I also liked the sound of this album. Volume 2, although a great album, sounds like it was recorded in a cave. Soft Machine Volume 2 sounds tighter mainly because the bass player, Hugh Hopper, holds things together better than Ayers did. Also, people give Ayers too much credit for the catchy songs on Vol. 1--he was the main writer on "Joy of a Toy" and "Why Are We Sleeping" neither of which were conventional pop songs. Wyatt and Ratledge wrote most of the more melodic pieces. It is however, one great song and both "Hope for Happiness" and "Priscilla" were harbingers of SM's later direction. An excellent album, a live and lively sounding record, and a masterful debut, which actually WAS recorded very quickly in order to capitalize on their tour with Hendrix.
0,Actually they are one of the great groups of all time and this becomes clear with this box set. While at first it may seem overkill, it is a fantastic selection of their songs over the years.
0,Gee, I had the chance to see these guys back during this tour in Philadelphia, but did I like them then, nooo, of course not- (kicks own ass). Sure, during this tour I think I was in 2nd or 3rd grade and during that time, my parents would only play Floyd CDs all the time, so it got a little tiring and of course, god forbid I gave in to their Adult music instead of the current Aerosmith fling I was on at that time...grr. But watching this concert always gives me the chills...especially the end of Comfortably Numb...Well, just watch what happens at the guitar solo at the end of the song and watch the crowds' reaction. Its an amazing scene. Anyone who has anything bad to say about this video except that its too short...needs to be dragged into the street to be beaten by a piece of heavy mining equipment and left bleeding in the moonlight. Almost sounds kinda romantic, lol. Overall, definately the BEST live video I've ever seen. Scared the crap out of some of my friends though, but for different reasons. One was totally at awe over the video and actually seemed to be in a trance because he was drooling, lol. The others' reaction was mainly, "hey who are these guys; I know this is a Pink Floyd song...But who are these old guys?"
0,This album is of the best mystic Native American music I have heard. All three discs from the Ah Nee Mah series of David and Diane Arkenstone capture an essence of exotic beauty and meaning beyond that of many fellow New Age artists. This album, as well as being a relaxing and/or meditation aid, has a complete concept around itself from begining to end just as any journey through music should. The soundscapes of Ancient Voices will take you there.	Ben.	the 15 year old.
0,Good CD from Slash and company.
0,A great CD at a great price and great service.  I would buy from this seller again.  Thank's
0,I've been a fan of Russell Walder's "Transit" album for over 20 years as of this writing but this newest album "Music for a Shift in Consciousness" has finally given "Trnasit" some competition. Having a much darker, and 'grayer' feel, there is a lot more serene and deeper feel with more electronic sounds and more rhythm, as opposed to the simple piano sounds of "Transit".
0,Not a fan of Elvis but all of his hits remind me of movies & songs' father played during my childhood. Great cd
0,A best mix for singers and songs from one of my all time favorite groups
0,CIARA SINGS THESE TUNES WITH SOME BALLS...(AND FROM THEM TOO). GOOD COLLABERATIONS ALSO ON OH AND 1 2 STEP. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

0,This two disc set is a Zep fan's dream.  This dvd showcases the gods of rock in all their mythic glory.  The first disc is a fantastic performance from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970.  The show opens with a rocking "We're Gonna Groove," a song which is heard all to rarely.  Page's violin bow solo on "Dazed and Confused" is a real treat to hear in 5.1 sound.  Other highlights include Page's guitar jam, "White Summer," a very long "How Many More Times," and a classic Bonzo drum solo on "Moby Dick."	Disc 2 is might even be better than the first disc.  It opens with a raw and heavy Immigrant Song.  I always prefer the live renditions of this song because of how raw it sounds.  We are than treated to four tunes from Madison Square Garden in 1973.  We are then treated to portions from two very famous Zeppelin performances, Earl's Court 1975 and Knebworth 1979.  It all begins with a very well filmed acoustic set that really shows the band having a good time.  Following the acoustic tunes we receive a mammoth rendition of "In My Time of Dying."  This tune is an absolute showcase of Zeppelin's power and their creativity with classic blues.  "Trampled Underfoot" is funk-blues fusion at its finest.  Page's solo on this tune raises the hairs on my neck everytime.  Knebworth was Zeppelin's final performance in their native England.  The band's career was drawing to a close but you wouldn't know it from these energetic performance.  Tunes such as "Sick Again," "Achilles Last Stand," "In the Evening," "Kashmir," and "Whole Lotta Love" take on a whole new life on stage.  The songs are equal to and in some cases superior to their studio counterparts.	All in all this is the absolute best concert dvd that you can buy.  The wait was well worth it.  A true treasure for Zeppelin fans the world over.  Nuff said.
0,When people mention the best MA album, Convenant and Blessed are the Sick are usual choices. However, I cannot see why this album is so underrated. It has everything that has made MA a success and more.		Pete "Commando" Sandoval performs flawlessly on his kit, with some of the fastest double bass I've ever heard, and some crazy fills. Steve Tucker is actually pretty impressive here, executing some really convincing and cool sounding deep guttural growls.		Of course the best part about the album has to be the phenomenal guitar playing. I have to say that this Gateways has some of the most impressive guitar leads and solos that I've heard on a death metal album. Trey and Erik pull off some truly technical and progressive sounding solos at times, but it's when they both let their emotional side come out that the solos are truly amazing. The amount of feeling heard in certain lead sections is sublime, especially for a death metal band. Not to mention two of the most emotional and well played solos I've ever heard, played in "At One With Nothing" in the middle and  toward the end of "God of the Forsaken" both by Mr. Erik Rutan. The man is godly and defintely underrated!	Oh, and maybe you know about that other guy, Trey Azagthoth...he's good too:)		If anyone ever questioned the amount of talent death metal gutiarists have, they need to hear these two play. Hell, the guitar solos alone are worth buying the album. I cannot recommend this CD more highly.
0,Whether Booker T. and The M.G.s should've been so audacious as to remake the Beatles Abbey Road as an instrumental is now history. This was their next to last album from the Stax era with basic tracks laid down in Memphis. Having owned this on EMI UK vinyl, the original Fantasy CD (lacklustre), the ZXY 24 bit master from 2001 (improved somewhat but mainly in increasing the amount of tape hiss) and the Universal Japan SHM- CD  (2009 - excellent) I have to say that Concord's Stax Remaster is an improvement on the latter for a quarter the price - great to have. Booklet notes excellent - plus additional Beatles tracks from archives and other Booker T. and The M.G.s' CDs - what's not to like?	New management at Concord in the person of a Chris Clough is now overseeing the Stax label after the utterly embarrassing "all mouth and trousers" 50th Anniversary initiative which ended up - with the exception of an utterly excellent remaster of "Black Moses" in a facsimile of the album sleeve that was 20% the price of the SHM-CD remaster that was extremely difficult to find - adding nothing to the Stax/Volt legacy - was Dusty Springfield necessary on the US "Boy Meets Girl" reissue?	Where Mr Clough takes us from here will be interesting - surely "Melting Pot" and maybe the Cropper/King/Staples masterpiece "Jammed Together" (why only part 1 of Tupelo on the Definitive Albert King??).	Good to have Stax brushed off and polished up - but - as Concord's vision of Stax moves to upgraded 24 bit remasters of the archives - much to the delight of soul music audiophiles - the paradox is the rest of the world heading towards downgrading said upgrades to mp3s.

0,Vinton's best known hits from the early `60s have become icons not only on Oldies Radio, but in films, commercials and elsewhere. "Roses Are Red (My Love)," "Blue On Blue," "Blue Velvet," "There! I've Said It Again" and "Mr. Lonely" are just a few of the great songs to which Vinton lent heartbreak and romance. Like a select few who came just before and after (e.g., Johnny Mathis, Bobby Rydell, Wayne Newton), Vinton thrived as a crooner in the rock `n' roll era. Especially impressive is that his success spanned across the Beatle-led British Invasion of the U.S. charts.		In addition to the chart-toppers, Vinton recorded a deep catalog of lesser-known hits and album tracks. He found both artistic and commercial success in reworking `60s hits like The Paris' Sisters' "I Love How You Love Me" and Brian Hyland's "Sealed With a Kiss," drawing out their tempos to magnify their emotion. His lush rendition of Goffin & King's "Halfway to Paradise" added a dash of Roy Orbison styled drama to Tony Orlando's original. It's surprising to note that several of the songs most closely associated with Vinton were actually covers: "Blue Velvet" was recorded by Tony Bennett in the early-50s, and "There! I've Said It Again" was a hit for Vaughn Monroe in the mid-40s.		The generously selected 25-song track songlist includes thirteen of Vinton's fourteen Top-20 singles, and a total of twenty-three Top-40s. Also included are a few lesser known, but equally interesting tracks, including a sweet cover of Johnny & Joe's "Over the Mountain (Across the Sea)," a Nashville Sound take of "My Elusive Dream," the Bobby Goldsboro-esque "The Days of Sand and Shovels," and Vinton's own "L-O-N-E-L-Y." Vinton's stint in the army not only resulted in "Mr. Lonely," but also the 1966 sequel, "Coming Home Soldier."		This is a superb collection of Vinton's most productive years at Epic, and the most complete such greatest hits disc on the market today. All of his major singles are here, except for 1964's "Clinging Vine," and his 1974 comeback on ABC, "My Melody of Love." The latter may be a casualty of inter-label licensing, but the omission of the former is mysterious. Sound quality is excellent, with finely produced true stereo throughout. 4-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.
0,One of the top dozen or so albums ever made... several Aphex Twin albums could claim this distinction actually, although the "rare" recently compliled remix singles (26 Mixes for Cash) would not be among them.... I recommend Mr. James' more personal early works such as The Richard D, James Album, I Care Because You Do, or the Come To Daddy EP.... adventerous newbies should not hesitate to increase their cool quotient, everyone else already knows what I've written.
0,Critics slammed this album when it came out, and I never understood why. Admittedly, it was not cutting-edge material such as Nirvana was releasing, but surely there still was and is a place for strong, traditional rock'n'roll. I don't like every song on this album equally, but there isn't a bad song in the lot. How many artists' albums can you say the same about?	Some of the songs have a Beatle-esque sound, such as "Golden Earth Girl," "C'mon People," and "Cosmically Conscious." The first one has some clever word play (as in "In eggshell seas" -- if you don't get it, go back to Mass). "C'mon People" is in the tradition of those great late-'60s to early-'70s McCartney power piano ballads such as "Live and Let Die," "Hey Jude," and "Let it Be." Although it doesn't quite reach the standard of those great songs, I thought that it would have been a fantastic single, but I never heard it on the radio. George Martin helped with the arrangements and production of this song, which may be what gives it its expansive sound. I also love the snatch of "Cosmically Conscious" on the album that sounds like a little Beatles psychadelia that fell off of the Magical Mystery Tour bus.	"Get Out of My Way" is another favorite of mine. It's got a brassy, mid-'70s rock sound that shows that Paul can still create good-time rock'n'roll.	"Winedark Open Sea" is beautiful and atmospheric and has that relaxed groove of some of the great ballads of the early 1970s by groups like the Stones and the Band. My only complaint is that he lets the end play out too long, as he also does on "Peace in the Neighborhood" and "I Owe it all to You." This is a gripe of mine with many of Paul's solo songs. I wish he'd try to be more succinct, like the early Beatles, and only let the rare song play out to five or more minutes.	"Hope of Deliverance" was one of the best songs on the album, with an insanely catchy, bouncy rhythm track.	The two songs he cowrote with Costello are fine but nothing special. I thought that their collaborations on "Flowers in the Dirt" were stronger.	The title track was another strong song with a great arrangement that is marred only slightly by the "La-La La-La-La" backing vocals during the chorus.	The only song on the album I disliked when it first came out was the preachy "Looking for Changes," but with time this song has gotten to sound better and more rocking to me. It's not a favorite of mine, but I no longer skip over it.	One of the things that made this album work so well was that Paul had a strong band that clicked on this album. They found good arrangements for a lot of the songs. This album really got short shrift from critics at the time, but with time this album will be recognized as much more deserving than they initially realized.
0,I thought i'd get your attention with that Pollard style title so here we go.		I discovered Gbv performing in a club on t.v. and i thought they rocked but like a fool i didn't pursue my interest.		Later i caught Gbv performing on Austin city limits and they again took my breath away with the band and fans having a drunken ball so i got off my butt and bought "Isolation drills" as it had "Glad Girls" which is the song that stung me.		Man, it's all about the music so anyone who might have been concerned about just the lo-fi aspect are as superficial as the mainstream scene that Indie rock was rebelling against to begin with.		You might as well call The Beatles "Sgt Peppers" a sell out because the Beatles had really refined their studio polish and taken advantage of all the other gadgets that a studio can offer to EXPAND their musical aspirations or horizons.		"Isolation Drills" is a dignified and special work of art.		Robert Pollard has given us a glimpse into his soul and a courageous look into his pain.		A pain resulting from a relationship on the rocks and displayed with a touching honesty and eloquence that is very compelling.		Songs such as "The brides have hit glass" reveal his hope to resusitate a fragile crackling bond of love that in reality is already broken.		"So i'll just hang around and take my chance		Once again i'll roll the dice And try to hang on to my shrinking paradise"		"Run Wild" reveals crushed dreams and the resulting abandon.		"Wooden heads on the chopping block  And other hearts pumping ink  That spills out over dreams of antiquity  Pale but full of ghostly charm  Leave your things in the street and run wild!"		"Sister i need wine" and "How's my drinking" reveal a uncontrollable self destruction and a cocky defiant stance in the fog of denial.		"And i am hating the ignorance in my body"		Yet "I won't change".		"Fine to see you" finds our hero hit rock bottom as he reveals that "there is nowhere to go but up" but that line alone sheds a shining hopeful optimism.		Melodic wise the songs range from glorious irresistable power pop gems like "Glad Girls" and "Chasing heather crazy" that have that same kind of catchy stick with you like glue magic as the classic "Game of Pricks".		You'll also find prog rock thunder in "The Enemy" and chiming folk rock beauty in "Twillight Campfighter" which contains one of Pollards most tender melodies drenched with "Byrds" influenced harmonies.		In short, "Isolation Drills" is one of Guided by Voices best albums bursting with a touching and revealing honesty that is performed with the utmost soul.		There may be polish but this kind of polish does nothing but reveal a glowing splendour of transcendant art.		For a fan to turn their back on this is the same as a Beatles fan who loved their early mop top sound yet refused to open their eyes to the treasures of "Revolver" and "Abbey Road".		Trully a loss.		Oscar F.
0,This is, along with Van Halen's first album, probably the best debut album of all-time. I recommend this 100%. But it's not just "Welcome to the Jungle," "Sweet Child 'O Mine," and "Paradise City" that make this a 15x platinum album. It's the supporting cast, such as "It's So Easy," "Nightrain," "Mr. Brownstone," "My Michelle," and "Rocket Queen." I really can't pick out one bad song here; they're all hardcore, super-charged songs. This covers everything that a hardcore rock album needs: dancing with Mr. Brownstone, telling of a girl w/ a dad in porno and a mom that was a heroine-addict, etc. Lastly, I really stress the fact that Slash is the most underrated guitarist around. Take one listen to this album and you'll hear some nasty riffs and crazy noises coming from his ax. This is the ultimate album, no question!
0,This CD makes for great listening while driving or just around the house. Willie does a great job with storytelling.
0,love this album at Christmas
0,There is a lot of good stuff on this album, one being Bret Scallions vocals. Another being the great lyrics. Fuel reminds me of Alice In Chains in the early 1990's. This was their brakeout album, and boy is it good. There are not trying to be something there not. The are just a good american rock band, the're not trying to be a metal band or a rap/rock band like Limp Bizket and such. The music on Something Like Human is really good, some of the stand out tracks here are 'Last Time' 'Hemorrhage' 'Scar' 'Bad Day' and 'Innocent' all the songs here are good but it seems to me that those are the strongest tracks. Fuel is a great band and I think they could go places, with their next album, and it doesnt hurt that they are a great live band as well.
0,Ann Wilson never ceases to amaze - with her vocals, and her rock n roll sense.
0,got this as a gift for my sister (read above), she likes it, has since gotten some of their studio albums
0,Disc 2 is great previously unreleased material.

0,I first heard of Steve Winwood in the 80's while still in high school. He had a few hits during that time that made there way into the pops charts when videos were becoming increasingly popular and better made. I had no idea that it would take me another 20+ years before I'd actually purchase an album of his and fall in love with his perfect pitch voice and the seemingly endless array of genres of music he can play.  I downloaded the music after hearing 'Dirty City' played on the morning news on the release date. It caught my attention and did not let go. After reviewing the other samples I immediately purchased the entire album. From beginning to end you will enjoy this 9 song collection.  From the acoustic 'I'm Not Drowning' through the funk & jazz inspired 'Hungry Man' to the gospel-organ tinged 'At Times We Do Forget' I was completely thrilled with this album.		I am someone who will rock out with Jay-Z or Linkin Park, listen to Nine Inch Nails, Celine and Mariah Carey. But every now and then I will want to relax and get a dose of Steve and his silky voice. A true music fan of any kind will enjoy this album.  Don't limit yourselves.  You will also hear Brazil and African drum influences as well.  With a great sound system you hear and feel so many colors in this music, I don't see how you can't...
0,Great album!
0,If you are open to YES' music and have really loved their previous albums, this diverse album should appeal to you as well. There are no clowns on here song-wise, this is musical sustenance, not candyfloss! The band is drawing from the wide-ranging talents of the band (and in an impressive way) without trying to slay you with virtuosity. It is a song-oriented approach (like Fragile) meant to give all members a chance to shine.		Read the lyrics as you listen to the songs. What a collection of compelling, heartfelt songs. They are all good. By the way, I for one think "Circus of Heaven" is one of the best songs on this release. Haunting and beautiful, the imagery is great and the melody and instrumentation are classic, soaring YES! Have you heard this played in concert? One of the favorites at the 'concert in the round' tour years. I saw them a few times then, that may be why this has a great impact on me. Jon is a little more "new age" and political than on some before, but I think that makes the album more interesting.		Future Times, Rejoice, Arriving UFO, and Madrigal are great songs about our greater connection to the universe played brilliantly. Madrigal is one of the more beautiful songs I have ever heard - Wakeman channels an ancient vibe with the harpsichord, the storytelling and vocal presentation by Jon is inspiring, with harmony/bass pedals by Squire, White takes a subtle role with bells,crotales and cymbals ... and the guitar by Howe is masterful (I'm a guitar player - try working on these chops!). How many bands have been this creative in soundscaping a piece? Strong statements in every way of the interests and talents of the band members.		And for the more rockin' songs: Don't Kill the Whale is a wonderful expression of humanities higher purpose with regard to the environment and stewardship of this planet, whales were getting some lousy treatment then. I am glad a band I love could speak out effectively; this was a top ten hit in England, I believe. Rock solid song if you ask me and Howe's guitar blazes a new trail for a pop song. Release, Release is a great rocker (one of their funnest songs) which highlights the energy and concert power of the band and furthers the band ethos as well ("no controllers"). The Steve Howe guitars sound really cool in this piece (using an old Broadcaster). I believe all lovers of YES in the seventies must get a thrill from the classic sound of On the Silent Wings of Freedom. Driving, melodic, classic Squire bass and trippy Howe power runs. Again, the message of the song is classic idealistic wonderful YES material.		I don't know where the criticism comes from. This is YES at a high point in my opinion and those of you who can't stand it - well, you must not have the YES feelin' in your bones. Sorry for the rant but I have to defend this fantastic piece of music so other seekers of quality music don't pass this by. Give it a chance. Crank it up. Open up! Fun collection of extras as well that really enhance this package! Thanks for considering my thoughts. And thanks to YES for all of the memories. P.S. Not all YES has to imitate Relayer or Close to the edge, they were great in their own way and so is this!
0,excellent
0,Little Queen is a nice CD, but it is not quite as good as Dreamboat Annie. That is my favorite CD of Heart. My favorite song on this CD of Little Queen is Barracuda.
0,Love Vince Gill...love this music.
0,when I was a kid everybody was into Floyd,but I didn't get to them until I was an adult! when I was a kid I had ELO,Alan Parsons project;you get the picture. I had this album as a kid,had to have it back in my collection!
0,another great gospel cd I would recommend any one to buy this cd it good to go.
0,This take two of Steven Stills Super Session shows Steven and Barry Goldbeg both from SS1 in good form, joined by the remarkable Kenny Wayne Shepard, this album tends towards the blues, and the songwriting is first rate and just a fun album to listen to.  Whether they continue this or go their separate ways, they left this document of 3 great musicians doing what they do best!
0,lovely piece of non invasive mood music;;good for "what ails ya' or doesn't"..add some new age-Dueter & all is well...there is too much rushing around today & things like this take you to a place of relaxation {meditation} ..put this on with low or no lites & taste of favorite wine & I would call that a perfect evening..better yet if was cold outide-raining or snowing a low flame fireplace going..delivery & quality of product was superb for low cost..
0,This new band is clearly going to be successful and a lot of radio play here lately. It Rocks !
0,Fun to listen to!
0,This album is dedicated to bluesman Blind Willie McTell and Dutch artist Gerrit Rietveld. And De Stijl in dutch means The Style and that's what they have and how they do it. It's another great album but now more based on piano as previous one. It includes two covers Death Letter and Your Southern Can Is Mine (the first originally from Son House and the other one by Blind Willie McTell, two blues legends). You're Pretty Good Looking (For a Girl)is a nice intro and a very catchy tune. Just like Apple Blossom. My favourite on this album is Truth Doesn't Make a Noise.
0,I love Palestrina, but most of all I love the Allegri Miserere.		I bought the CD to replace an earlier version (performed by the St. John's College Choir)and I was really quite delighted.		The first surprise was to hear the Allegri piece in English. It's good; very good. Not as good as it is in Latin, but still fits the music well. The quality of this recording is breathtaking. You can genuinely sense the atmosphere of the recording space ... the voices simply fade away to nothing in the heights of the building. And the voices you hear seem like the voices of angels.		Similarly, the Palestrina pieces are exceptionally well performed and produce.		However, the real gem (and it's a diamond) is the Allegri. If ever there was a piece of music that can soothe ruffled brows it's this. Let the boys' voices life you to heaven like the soft, gentle wings of angels. Come home stressed, make a cup of hot chocolate, close the curtains, dim the lights and let the sound soothe you.
0,as a musician with 60 years experience this is one of the nicest, tasteful recordings of Christmas music I've ever heard. She is just awesome in my book!
0,Best new album from them since Razor's Edge. Awesome  packaging. No filler. Every song is killer. A must have  for all rock fans.
0,This was the first A3 album I ever bought and it is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I had already heard the awsome "Jaked On Green Beers"(Remains is my second favorite A3 album), so I knew what i was getting into, but I didn't know that this one album would make me a die hard A3 fan.  For most people, this was A3 "selling out" because they switched from one small label, Asian Man Records, to another silghtly larger label, Vagrant Records.  Don't believe that.  This album is just as good, if not better, than the critically acclaimed Goddamnit and Maybe I'll Catch Fire.  The songs are so catchy that you will find yourself singing along regardless of whether you know the lyrics or not. The lyrics in question are hilariously clever and witty, I wanted to learn them just so that I could use them in everyday conversations.  The thing I love about A3 is that no matter how catchy the songs are, there is always an air of darkness to them. I am also a huge heavy metal fan and my friends give me a lot of flak for listening to bands that aren't as metal as they want them to be, but that has never happened with A3.  I love every track on this album and reccomend it to anyone who likes a bit of darkness with their punk-pop(I really hate to use that term because it's such an oxymoron, but I can't think of any other genre that fits0.
0,Did I say I love it?  Jagger/Richards in touch with the roots of rock and blues.  Keith's guitar work on Prodigal Son blows me away every time I hear it.  Fabulous songwriting.  The stones know how to tell a story and get into the dark side.  One awesome piece of work.
0,classic 70's pop
0,Recognizing that there are precious few very good live recordings by any rock group in the mid sixties, the fact that this even exists is cause for celebration. In fact it has all the low fidelity of a bootleg, in mono, but with very articulated separation of instruments and voices. And what those instruments and voices convey is incredibly powerful. The seven tunes here comprise a set and an encore and they are each worth the price of the disc by itself. The Yardbirds were committed to scorching their way through the blues, and in doing so in this live context, they show just how much further ahead they were than the Stones, the Animals, basically everyone except the Beatles and the Zombies, whose mebrace of Bill Evans modal style jazz set them off ina separate universe altogether.	This is this band in 1964. The Beatles were bopping along with HARD DAY'S NIGHT and an assortment of pop singles. The Stones were still trying to figure out their persona. Dave Clark was a Phil Spector nocturnal ecstacy. Nobody was like The Yardbirds. Essaying deep blues issues such as "Got Love If You Want It", and "The Sky is Crying" as though they wrote the songs, there is an undeniable command of the material here that other groups had not quite locked on to. All of the members play as a well integrated team, and Clapton, while a formiddable presence in this group, seems light years away from turning the world on its head in Cream. In fact it is hard to imagine the light years he would cross in two years time to go from this protean blues player to rock and psychedelic demi-god, before cashing that in to become the laconic journeyman of first Derek fame and then as solo writer.	This is all feral powerhouse blues rock at this stage, and make no mistake about it, Clapton in this band and with John Mayall, wrote the book for everyone after him, with the exception of Hendrix and Stevie Ray. this is a great document to have of a man and a band in its nascent stages. As I'm saying, it is just staggering to think of where he would take his craft after this point. He is already at this stage severely out ahead of the pack and he has not even begun to burn yet.  This band pushed Clapton and the rest of us should be grateful they did. Hear it for yourself.
0,This is a great Cd. Two thumbs up all the way. It is totally a phat CD. 5  Stars, Totally.
0,As kids we used to listen to the Monkees and watch the reruns on TV. I actually wasn't as interested as some but hey, the songs stuck. When I got older and became more interested in 60's music I found that the Monkees' tunes definitely stood out as consistently enjoyable. So, when I heard that they were making a new album, I was pretty interested because I know Mickey Dolenz still has a great voice. To my surprise many of the tracks on this album are great. I am so inspired by artists who never stop doing what they love. This album really is a labor of love, of generations coming together and of celebrating good times!
0,Once again AZ brings street crafted rhymes over pure hip hop music. The production on this LP is solid, much like all the work he puts out. For AZ fans this will sure help re-kindle their hip hop light.
0,I never get tired of this music.
0,This is one of my favorite albums by James Newton Howard.  It's not necessarily one of his better known ones, but the great themes combined with guest appearances by famed violinist Alasdair Fraser, The Goo Goo Dolls, and BBMak make for a great all-around album.
0,...but this is a great CD if you liked the music from that decade.  If you don't, then you must be an idiot for buying this as 1) everyone who reviews this album and band mentions their music is very heavily influenced by that era or 2) you saw them on MTV or heard them on the radio before buying the CD, at which point you should KNOW what they sound like!		I for one liked this CD a lot, I bought it after hearing one song on MTV.  One of the reasons I like music from this era is because there is so much CRAP on the radio these days, or that good music goes vastly unnoticed in the US (you can't even find Jamiroquai's new CD in stores here), that these bands that play music from the 80's are more refreshing and (believe it or not) original than everything else I hear, I gravitate to them.		Bottom line, if you liked the 80's, then you will like this Bravery CD...
0,Really a unique approach, but definitely worth the time to check out!! I love it!! The Beastie Boys never fail to deliver.
0,My favorite "spaghetti" western of all time!!  I'm peeved at myself for taking so long to own the soundtrack!
0,Perhaps it was because of the long withstanding association with George Clinton that gives me the outlook on Red Hot Chili Peppers as more of a funk band than a rock one. That doesn't of course mean that I dislike rock. In fact this album is very obviously going for the similarly sprawling double album statement that The Clash were going for with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/London-Calling/dp/B00004BZ0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">London Calling</a>&nbsp;or that James Brown was going for with albums such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hell/dp/B000001E77/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hell</a>. Actually,this seems to adopt aspects of both of those albums in many ways. It would seem that the band were going for something of a more polished alternative rock light on their previous couple albums to this. It was almost as if their funk oriented beginnings had been some type of fashionable embrace of the genre on their part. It wasn't as it turned out. And in many ways funk,a music that requires a level of focus to do it well would be a good way to bridge an album trying to do as much as this one does together.		  For a double album clocking in at a little over two hours there's a lot of material on here that is a little repetitive. "Dani California","Desecration Smile" and the title track are all interesting enough songs. But most of the other rock oriented songs here,if you take away a lot of the window dressing instrumental ideas are not all that different from each other or anything else the band has done. While in a lot of ways the same could be said of the funkier numbers it's there that a bit of the spice of variety comes into play. Both "Charlie" and "Warlocks" both meld one of their classic rhythm guitar based funk grooves with a pop/rock type song. "Tell Me Baby" and especially "21'st Century" both acknowledge the 70's a bit more with the disco-funk "boogie" hybrid sound that plays a little more cleanly and represent my personal favorites on the album. "Storm In A Teacup" sounds a lot like "Give It Away" from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blood-Sugar-Sex-Magik/dp/B000002LQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blood Sugar Sex Magik</a>,which makes one wonder if their rap/rock thing isn't really beginning to where thin. "Hey" and "Turn It Again" offer somewhat more jazz-fusion style instrumental approaches. But they pretty much turn into standard pop songs before they get going.		  Ultimately they tried for something very big hear,basically by releasing a lot of material even when they had a lot more to release. There was certainly a lot of hoopla when this came out and it seemed like an almost infinite number of different packaging ideas for the album itself. That alone made it seem like it was the greatest album they ever made. In all honesty,it's hardly a masterpiece. The songs certainly all tie together well. And the songs that groove tend to give it that added kick as always. But all the same they aren't adding anything particularly new to their style either. There's the impression of a band somewhat on cruise control here. Of course yet another member transition was about to take place. So that might have had something to do with it. In the end,when it's good it's pretty near great. And it doesn't actually have as many ballads as people think it does. More or less it's mid-tempo pop/rock for the most part. So depending the type of Chili Peppers that floats your boat,and for certain they do have many musical sides to them,this will either thrill you or not. It's all a matter of taste.
0,Some of the best dance music of the 1970's was produced by Vincent Montana, his Salsoul Orchestra, and Salsoul Records.  For some strange reason, Salsoul hits were left out of Rhino's "The Disco Years" and other disco compilations.  "The Original Salsoul Classics" makes up for this grievous defect by collecting some of the best of the best of Salsoul Records, not only hits by the Salsoul Orchestra but also by the First Choice, Loleatta Hollway, Bataan, Ripple, Instant Funk and many others.  The only thing I regret is the absence of Charo's "Dance a Little Bit Closer" and the Salsoul Orchestra's own "Tangerine," but hopefully these will appear in future compilations.
0,I have all her music, this cd is very good, Stronger is one of my favorite  cds of Sara, but then I like all her tunes so so much, you will enjoy this collection.
0,I listened to Movin' On and can tell that the CD has not been re-mastered, but it sounds great!  I have always had a desire for the album Movin' On  to be on CD and finally it is.  I love the CD and I am thankful !
0,I am trying to get my favorite vinyl collection before They can not ever be found again Would definately reccomend to other buyers
0,Angles Calling Me, through the night.		Denean caught me with that song and never let go. The whole CD is just as spiritual for want of a better word. Every song touches me and I find this the perfect CD to relax to after a crazy day.		Another song that is simply amazing is Dance of the Winged Ones, so beautifully arranged and timed to perfection. The native Indian mantra plus it together.		One of my favorites, please give it a listen. Or just buy and be glad you did. It is that good.
0,I have two other Buble' CDs which I rated at 5 stars.  Although this is a fine CD, it doesn't quite match up to the studio productions of the other two.  That being said, if you're a true Buble' fan, this CD won't disappoint.
0,Okay, two, but the one cannot be helped, which is: I really want this in French - the other is the Fontainebleu scene has been cut. Bad. Bad. Bad. Verrett is effective as Eboli but her ha-ha-ha's to cut the tricky parts in The Veil Song are not only annoying, but very incorrect, as in bad singing. Bumbry may well be the best Eboli of the last two decades and most often those who can sing The Veil Song cannot sing O don fatale.... As for Corelli, well, hey! he could sing a menu. One of my Opera News Online friends cannot believe I'm nuts about Corelli, and I quote: "He bleats like a goat." Oy! Everyone should bleat so GOOD. On this recording he does not bleat. It should be noted that I do not like a fast vibrato - okay, nor do I like a slow vibrato, to say nothing of a wobble (I adore Callas, however, warts and all). The interesting thing about opera lovers is that everyone has an opinion, although I do prefer EDUCATED opinions.		I'm not saying this is my favorite Carlos (and that is the fellow's name so I've never understood why the "s" is so often dropped), but it's right up there.
0,Pretty good blue grass tunes.
0,This dvd takes me back to the 80s when I was a teenager. I love it! Thanks!
0,Neil again
0,... This Messiah has recently been re-released at a much cheaper price. Go back and look for the DG "The Originals" release, which is being sold new for under $12.
0,First off For all who do not own a copy of this album and bash it to convince people to listen to 'real hiphop' are wasting time.....Stop telling people what to listen to, nor whine about an artist you do not like if because its NOT relevant to the album at all.		Second off, Ive listened to this cd for a few days now, and the beats, more impressive than I thought. Theres a mix of southern and New York style-ish beats on here, so theres good variety on this disc right here. Lyrics? More distinguishable than the previous Cash Money releases, but this time around it feels much more serious and actually like a complete record thats been taken time to fully create. One of my favorites on here, 'Reciept' rocks a typical east coast sounding beat with a nice soul sample,  on this one Wayne shows some more versitality on here, instead of throwing a bunch of words together to make a rap like it seemed like he used to. Theres More delivery, more punches, not bad for a southern artist like himself. THis is the direction he shouldve BEEN taking his skill of lyricism too, now all he needs to do is roll on with it. There are conceptual songs on here, such as 'Grown Man', 'Hustler Musik' 'Reciept' are fine examples of this. There are punches and metaphors he uses on the versus and they do stand out, most are basic, but nothing to played out nor wack.  If you ever doubted the southern rap scene,  give this one a try, I personally believe its one of the better southern hiphop cd's to be released all yr		Good production, good to exceptional/respectable lyrics , not quite there in 5' star range in my opinion, but its pretty damn good.
0,This review is for those interested in the vinyl edition of the Bluenote Cafe release.  I have purchased all of Neil's releases on vinyl and all have been spectacular pressings.  Bluenote Cafe is no exception.  If you are a lover of vinyl you will be most pleased with the quality of these records. The four Lp's come in a numbered box similar to the Greendale set, and includes the same type of one page booklet you get with the CD version.  Most of the recent releases have been pressed at Pallas in Germany, but this one does not appear to have been pressed there.  That said; the records are flat and dead quiet pressings.  I did need to clean them first as they were very dusty, but I always clean my new vinyl before that first play.		The music here is just outstanding, with the band playing with conviction and fire.  Neil's guitar work is filled with passion and those horns really draw you into the songs.  The song lyrics seem to reveal that Neil may have been having some serious issues with his relationship with Pegi at the time.  He sounds conflicted  and was perhaps being tempted to stray from his marriage.  Songs like Married Man, Hello Lonely Woman, and Don't Take Your Love Away From Me. Neil also hits hard on social issues of the day which actually seem just as relevant today as they did in the eighties. Crime in the City and Ordinary People both carry a heavy punch here, as the band really goes much deeper into these songs than in the studio versions.		If you are a fan of Neil Young and have been enjoying these Performance Series releases then you will want to add this one to your collection.  The vinyl is high quality and the music is outstanding.  I know it's a big investment, but it is a four record set that comes in a sturdy box and the music will definitely get your speakers singing  and your house shaken. Very highly recommended.
0,Folklore & Superstition. Black Stone Cherry. Good title. Good band. I like their sound. I came across them purely by accident and I  like this album by them. They seem to have a unique sound that reminds me of something lost long ago. If I listen to it now and again, it may come to me.
0,Love this older music.  Amazon only place I could find it.
0,German metal band Victory released their third album "Culture Killed The Native," in 1989. While most German bands played a more straight-ahead hard rock like the Scorpions, Victory actually drew their sound more from the American pop-metal scene of the late 1980s. While some may debate how effectively Victory pulled this off, I, for one, think the band did a bang-up job of ripping off the Sunset Strip sound of the era.		"Culture Killed The Native" was actually pleasantly surprising to me when I first heard it. I really wasn't expecting very much from the album when I purchased it, but after several listens I really began to be impressed. What separated Victory from most other bands I listen to from the day is vocalist Fernando Garcia. This dude has a simply amazing voice, and is easily the highlight of the record. After several listens I was kind of dumbfounded how these guys never made it bigger here in the States. They seemingly had everything needed to be huge back in the day, and it makes me wonder if it wasn't just poor management that kept these guys from being stars. The album has its share of ups and downs, to be fair, but a couple tracks really stuck out as my favorites: "Power Strikes The Earth," "Let It Rock On" and "Standing On The Edge Of Time."		This is easily Victory's strongest album to date. If you still enjoy that hard rock style that made Warrant and Poison such monsters back in the day, then you should really check Victory out pretty quick. There is no way fans of melodic rock won't love this album, and you'll be pretty blown away by Fernando Garcia's vocals to boot.
0,This box set is a must have for the true Haggard and country music fan. Nashville has long turned it's collective back on Haggard - and he seems to have reciprocated. Unfortunately this has left a void in young people's appreciation of what has come before the Toby Keiths and Trace Adkins' of the world. This set gives not only a great insight into who Merle Haggard is, but also into the evolution of some of the many classics he's written and recorded. We get several inside glimpses into the recording process of the classics through the outtakes that are included here. Untamed Hawk shows you why Haggard will always be a legend in country music and why he's one of the "First Name" club members of country music along with Hank, Johnny and Lefty. The only drawback is that this is a Bear Family collection and as such the artist receives precious little, if any, of the money you pay out for it.
0,The first B,S&T album is arguably their best. Unlike the David Clayton Thomas era,the Al Kooper version is dominated by the horn section. I CANT QUIT HER is a wonderful should've-been hit. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW is a great bluesy rocker. The highlights of the album are MY DAYS ARE NUMBERED and JUST ONE SMILE.Horns have never sounded better in pop music as they sound on those two songs. MORNING GLORY and SO MUCH LOVE are great songs as well. The Clayton Thomas led band is great too, but I would have loved to have heard another album from this lineup.
0,Mark Oliver Everett , 'E' , the front man of EELS. This man is the soul of the band. His voice , his energy , his passion and his emotions represent every beautiful track in this collection.		It's not about shakin legs or smiling sweet. It's all about relating to all the rubbish that goes on around you and within your personal life. EELS can bring you down and pull you right up to the top with their music.		This album is a collection of most of my favorite EELS songs, and if you are a first time listener, then this collection is the best way to introduce you to the band.		It's not about winning grammys or making appearences at award shows , its about playing straight from the heart. That's what E does. I recently lost my dad and his single 'It's a mother #$%#$%' makes me cry a tear everytime i play it on my cd system.		Pick it up people, EELS are a fine example of great musicians that hit the right cord in each of their songs.		Enjoy..oh btw..pick up the 'Useless Trinklet's' CD too, it's got plenty of great b-sides and unreleased tracks.
0,This was excursion into the world of Evergrey, and I was not disappointed! Tom Englund's voice is very unique in the metal world, and gives the music a lot of emotion and intensity. My favorites from this album are "Wrong," "To Fit the Mold," "Phantom Letters," and "...And the Distance."
0,OK, let me get this straight. A lot of people talk this and that about Master P and No Limit Records. But back when this album came out, everybody as well as myself was loving it. This is more then a good southern album, its an album that put the south on the map. I'll admit, I really don't listen to Master P or No Limit albums anymore, but I give him the upmost respect. Not only was this one of my favorite albums of all time, but it showed people that the south was comming up, and makin people turn their heads.
0,Excellent
0,My personal favorite album of all time from any artist.  Incredibly deep and moving.  A guitar masterwork.
0,This is Leon Russell at his best before he was "discovered". Most of the songs are laced with protest, both of the Vietnam war and the direction America was moving in. Like Country Joe, Russell was opposed to war, and this comes across clearly and cleverly. If you thought that war was a good idea you won't like this CD. Russell's skillful guitar playing underlines the message and brings it to life.	I have to discuss the politics that underlie this album, because it is all about politics. Russell even had the guts to critique the "good war", WW II, in the moving "Ballad of A Soldier". "Soldier" helps prove that moral dilemmas are inherent in combat, inescapable, from the Good War to the mess in the Middle East. Russell's piano playing drives the song forward to its conclusion: "The battle's lost and won, and still it goes on." It is to Russell's great credit that he was able to capture this in a way that is also entertaining. One of the lesser known classics of the acid-rock movement.
0,Like so many others, I hunted down this CD after hearing the Kossoy's version of "I'll Fly Away" in OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU and finding a different version on the soundtrack.  It was worth the time it took to track it down.	The whole CD has that early-morning haunt sound of "I'll Fly Away."  "Bowling Green" is great, as are "Poor Ellen Smith," "What Will We Do With The Baby O," "The Darby Ram" and, of course, the heartstopping "I'll Fly Away."	This isn't quite bluegrass; it's mountain music with one foot in pre-civil war English/Irish immigrant tunes.  Great stuff.
0,Have had this CD for less than 3 days, mind made up, best of this genre that I have heard this year.		Some die-hard Chi fans are berating this effort because it doesn't duplicate the sounds of CTA-II-V-VII-VII (Guercio) or the 17-21 (Foster) sounds.  I knew that Scheff and Champlin had the makings of giving this band new life, given the right production and management.		This band has finally, (under Jay DeMarcus production) with XXX, come into their own. Of note, checking the Rascall Flatts website, DeMarcus profile shows that Chicago and David Foster were two of his major influences.  It shows on this production.		The STRONG voices of Lamm, Champlin and Scheff, with the addition of TOTO members Bobby Kimball and Joseph Williams, and the Rascal Flatts singers makes for as strong a vocal production they have done since Cetera's departure, breaking new ground for the band.  Instrumentally, the bands already strong skills are supplanted by  some of Nashville's best hired guns on guitar and drums.		Stylistically, they cover Trip-Hop-Pop, Power Ballads, Power Pop, New Country, Jazz Fusion, and Blues Rock.  This kind of diversity is unheard of in todays' music scene.		"Love Will Come Back" with Rascal Flatts on vocals has the makings of a new country hit. Expect it to be the most added song to New Country playlists		"Caroline" as the makings of a Power Pop anthem. Renegade rock stations stand the best chance of adding this to playlists.		"King of Might Have Been" is another stand-out, Scheff power ballad.		"Feel", the first single, has the best chance on the Adult Contemporary scene, with its updated beat and production values.		"90 Degrees and Freezing" is a Lamm Jazz-Fusion piece which reminds you of the roots of the band back inthe 60's and early 70's. Maybe Jazz and Public stations will play this, too complex and tight for AAA, too hip and edgy for AC.		Other material is very good, not just "filler" but it's doubtful any of it will ever get airplay.		All in all, a very pleasant surprise to critical listeners.  No corners were cut on this production, and Warner/Rhino seems to be doing a good job at promoting it.  Just hope they can break them back into the spotlight.
0,Rarities, and good ones at that .Basically, this music proves that, if you strip away the distortion, the feedback, the burning guitars, and the onstage stunts, Jimi could've easily made a career as a pure blues guitarist. The album's horn-powered instrumental title song is a fine example; as is "Here He Comes (Lover Man)", taken at a blistering pace and equipped with a classic guitar solo; studio versions of "Power of Soul" and "Message to Love" are among Jimi's most fascinating and underrated tracks, with him eschewing his signature distortion almost entirely and still doing some of his best work. That's another thing this album proves - Jimi's technique was remarkable. It wasn't all smoke and mirrors. There's even an Elmore James cover, "Bleeding Heart" - how hardcore is that? I do think bits of this are unneeded, though. For instance, "Tax Free" is just Jimi soloing for five minutes against an inconsistent backdrop that actually uses a Doors tune, "Five to One", as the basis for one part's rhythm. There's nothing wrong with the playing, of course, but given the song's lack of a melody or even theme I get the feeling that nobody intended to release it. Instead, I think Jimi and a few friends sat down, got really high, and just played stuff. It could've worked as the basis for a song, for sure. But as an independent tune? No. The other guitar solos, "Midnight" (with a slightly distorted blues riff) and the funky "Pali Gap", are much better. But I'm not a great fan of the avant-garde "Stars that Play with Laughing Sam's Dice". It's a great title, but a dated song. It was only issued as a b-side - the flip, "All Along the Watchtower", is only available in its single mix, and while it's not terribly different from the well-known album version, that's okay because it's still "All Along the Watchtower", if you get what I mean. That said, I don't see why they included it. Anyway, for those interested there are also a couple demos - a good instrumental take of "Little Wing", and a bizarre "Angel", which starts halfway through the first verse and contains none of the gorgeous psychedelic guitar of the more well-known First Rays version. To my ears, the best track is the Delta blues of "Midnight Lightning", little more than Hendrix and an electric guitar, and it's one of his best guitar performances, too. This is only really of interest to the big fans, like me, but if you are a big fan and you've touched on all the essentials, this is a nice follow-up buy.
0,if you like the show and the music then get the cd
0,a must have for any Bocelli fan - beautifyl music, beautiful place - grazie, Signor Bocell!  BRAVO!		nice DVD to share!

0,There were no problems with this order
0,I haven't even finished listening to the first disc and I'm already in love. I'll let you know if I change my mind but don't stay up too late waiting.
0,ALLSTAR BAND, WITH JOE BONAMASSA ON GUITAR, AND JASON BONHAM (JOHN'S SON) ON DRUMS!! OTHER 2 ARE GREAT AS WELL. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE 3 CD'S. DUE TO BONAMASSA'S POPULARITY, THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANYMORE. BUT YOU CAN GET DVD, LIVE OVER EUROPE, IT'S NEXT ON MY LIST!!
0,I had this album in the '70's, and it's really nice to have the CD.  Great quality of music, and the CD is the same as the album.
0,If you listen to the radio, you will not find these songs anywhere. They are not played on the oldies channels which tend to focus on the group's 60's material, and you won't find it on the "Classic Rock"  stations. This is unfortunate. Perhaps it has something to do with the  relative lack of commercial success of most of these songs. This is sad, as  I feel that this period was one of the most creative for the band.  "Add Some Music To Your Day" is one of the group's best. I was  always a fan of the Holland album and was happy to see that the "The  Trader" and "California Saga" were included. The covers of  "Peggy Sue", "Come Go With Me" and "California  Dreamin'" are surprisely enjoyable. While this material is not as well  known as their 60's classics, it has aged very well and stands the test of  time. Recommended for all fans of the Beach Boys.

0,Like CHESS, another musical with more of a "pop" sound than most Broadway scores, JEKYLL AND HYDE has potential, but no one has yet figured out how to make it work as a whole.  The potential is provided by Frank Wildhorn, a composer with a rare talent for spinning out beautiful melody after beautiful melody.  The major problem is the book:  it can't seem to decide what the main story is, the struggle of Dr. Jekyll with his scientific experiment, his relationship with his fiance, or the life of harlot he meets.  The book problems lead to inconsistent lyrics by Leslie Bricusse - on some tunes (such as "Take Me As I Am" and "Confrontation"), the words are ideal; on others (most notably "Bring On the Men" and "Murder, Murder!") the text is banal; most songs have fairly decent lyrics with a few clunker lines.	However, this recording has some other qualities to recommend it.  Firstly, since this is a pre-Broadway "concept" double CD, there are a plethora of wonderful Wildhorn tunes.  (Many of these tunes have since been dropped from the show.)  Secondly, Jekyll is played by the talented Anthony Warlow, who has a powerful voice perfect for portraying a passionate young man on a difficult quest; the alternate voice he provides for his alter ego, Hyde, is remarkably different, and it's fascinating to hear him switch back and forth between the two roles.  A third feature of this recording is the inclusion of Linda Eder in the part of the harlot.  Many (too many, for the show to maintain its focus on Jekyll) of the songs feature Eder's bold, brassy, Streisand-esque voice.	I recommend this recording over an earlier concept recording featuring Colm Wilkinson and Linda Eder because there is more music on this recording, and Warlow has the superior voice.	My recommendation:  the vast majority of the music on this recording of JEKYLL AND HYDE is superb.  Two of the three leads are very talented.  (I do not care for Carolee Carmello's voice.)  For me, that's enough to make this an enjoyable recording.  However, if you're looking for consistently good lyrics, a plot that makes sense, or an accurate representation of the show as it appeared on Broadway, look elsewhere.
0,How can you go wrong buying this CD?  Most of these songs are already classic Maroon 5.  This band will be around for a long time.....their music is so today!
0,Big fan of Matchbox 20 and Rob Thomas
0,This will definitely lift your spirits. I was feeling very sad. A lot of problems in my life right now, but this album eased the pain. The duet with Natalie Cole is amazing.
0,I became an instant fan of Laura's music, after my first listen to the first track on this CD. Her musicianship and sense of melody are exceptional. This is music to sooth and heal, but also to attentively listen and enjoy. Casual listeners will certainly appreciate it as calming background music, but closer listening reveals further depths and treasures. There is a subtle beauty that is much more than what you see (or in this case hear), if you take the time to delve deeper. Just gorgeous stuff.
0,With A Sense Of Purpose added to the stack, In Flames now has eight full length albums. You can break their cd's down to two era's, or two styles.  The Jester Race, Whoracle, and Colony, fit into the old era, and In Flame's 'old style' which was melodic death metal that had a 'zelda type swedish melodic sound' to it.  And then you have Clayman, which style wise is a mix of the old sound and new sound.  And then you have Reroute To Remain, Soundtrack To Your Escape, Come Clarity, and now A Sense Of Purpose, which falls under In Flame's new era of albums, and a new, different style from the old In Flames.  I am a HUGE fan of both era's and both styles.  In my eyes In Flames has evolved, and even if you don't like their new stuff, you still have countless hours of melodic death metal albums that In Flames produced years ago.  With A Sense Of Purpose, you get the feeling that In Flames is done experimenting, and has found the sound they have been trying to reach since Clayman(when they first started evolving and experimenting).  A Sense Of Purpose has a similar sound to Come Clarity, but is for sure a different album.  Both cd's are almost masterpiece's, but let's talk about A Sense Of Purpose.  In my eye's, A Sense Of Purpose is the closest In Flame's has come to a 'return to form' in the new era of their albums.  Anders sounds like a complete different singer now then from the old era, but on atleast 6 to 7 songs on this cd, you will find Jesper and Bjorn hitting beautiful melodic notes start to finish.  Many sounding similar to their old work.  But Ander's clean singing voice, and high pitched scream, along with Daniel's slick drumming, through's out the sound of 'This is a EVOLVED In Flames, with a new wave of power behind them'.  This record is absolutely awesome, on tracks 9 and 11, you can feel the raw energy of the band as a whole.  That is something the old records do not have, even though they are masterpiece's and I like them more than the new one's, they were so melodic, and were just a polished, repolished, and almost over produced.  On Come Clarity and A Sense Of Purpose, the songs pump out power and energy, with a electric volume of thunderous melodies.  A Sense Of Purpose is a bit more melodic then Come Clarity, but like I said before, the guitars on it hit home with melodic death metal influences.  And while in flames is just a pure melodic metal band now, not a melo-death band, you still get the vibe of melo death on many songs on this album, and can tell it's the same band, with new screws pieced in, and old rusty screws dropped off.  Daniel's drumming is better then ever, and in my book finally gets a check next to his name as one of metal's top level drummers.  His bass pedal and fills are top notch, and he tuned his drums better for this album then he has on any of the other cd's that he is on.(From Colony on).  So my conclusion for this review is this, In Flames is in my top 3 for favorite bands, all their cd's are absolutely fantastic, and A Sense Of Purpose gets a 9 out of 10.
0,The rise and fall of the Wu-Tang Clan can be roughly divided into two halves: the meteoric rise to fame and domination of the 1993 to 1997 period, with half-time at Wu-Tang Forever, and from 1997 onwards the slow decline downards with a few notable peaks. Ghostface Killah, the Wu's second most popular member, is undeniably most reponsible for these peaks.		Whereas in the first half every single thing the Wu touched seemed to have the words classic or groundbreaking or superior stamped all over it, with a forever classic debut clan album as well as some amazing solo efforts from Raekwon, Gza, ODB, Rza and Method Man, the second half of the 90's was not as good for the Wu. The second round of solo albums that were released were generally underwhelming... OBD gradually fell deeper and deeper into trouble, Meth became a virtual hip-pop star, Rae and Deck fell off slightly, and worst of all, the Abbot Rza suddenly wasn't able to drop his patented magic as consistently as he did before. All this added up to a string of releases that were, ultimately, disappointing. Many proclaimed the Wu to be dead. In 2000, Ghost stepped up with his sophomore release "Supreme Clientele". Having released a strong debut album, "Ironman" , many proclaimed this to dodge the sophomore slump and to be the the album to bring back the Wu empire.		Track Listing		1. Intro.		2. Nutmeg.

0,If you want to hear one of pop music's best written songs then Vanessa Carlton's debut Be Not Nobody is the record to purchase.  Breakout hit "A Thousand Miles" soared to No. 1 on charts because of its unique piano arpeggios and gorgeous melodies.  Though her hits ("A Thousand Miles," "Ordinary Day" and "Pretty Baby") are her best on the album, this disc is still pretty impressive.  "A Thousand Miles" definitely should've won a Grammy for Song of the Year, and not Norah Jones' not-even-self-penned (Carlton wrote "A Thousand Miles" by herself, along with the majority of her tunes of her debut) "Don't Know Why;" I honestly "don't know why" Jones is so big.  Though her singing vocals aren't that unique or distinvtive, and Be Not Nobody sports lots of filler, Vanessa Carlton and her record are definitely worth knowing better and purchasing.
0,My goodness do I have a lot of David Garrett's music!  All worth it!  He's straddling classical with contemporary music is phenomenal and just right to bring more musicians to our world.  Perhaps if more people were practicing or playing together, we might have a more peaceful world, certainly a more beautiful one!
0,I see some don't give this record high marks. That's OK...there are lots of opinions in this world and everybody's got one.		  I'd never heard of Ms. Scheinman but saw a little post in the NYT the other day, talking about her performance somewhere in the city.  Sounded interesting so I came here and bought the mp3 version.  The first song (a Dylan tune) was an eye-opener.  Have heard that song a hundred times but this was something new--I got a whole new apprecation of the song.  Similar to what Tim O'Brien's Red on Blonde did for me some years back.  I have no reservations whatsoever in recommending this recording.
0,excellent band. You should check them out if you like guitars without vocals.
0,Love, love it!!!!
0,Lots of fun, and strange origins.
0,Not a bad cd.
0,If you don't know who Rory Gallagher was, you missed the best blues-man to ever walk on Irish soil. A reporter asked Jimi Hendrix who he listened to? Rory Gallagher was the answer.
0,The season six "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" episode that inspired this soundtrack is not to be missed--Buffy and the Scooby Gang sing and dance their way through Sunnydale, making for very compelling viewing. I was skeptical about the success of a "musical" episode, but Joss Whedon's ability to enrich various plotlines through music is impressive. Standout numbers include Anya's "Bunnies" rant in "I've Got A Theory," Spike's "Rest in Peace," and the poignant "Where Do We Go From Here." If you loved the episode, I doubt you'll be disappointed with the soundtrack.
0,Crystal clear and smooth as silk

0,What an amazing record -- I first discovered this music on vinyl years ago after hearing the several classic collaborations between the arranger Gil Evans and trumper Miles Davis.  If you have admired the Gil Evans arrangements on the Miles recordings, you owe it to yourself to check this out. These recordings help make the case that Gil Evans was one of great jazz arrangers of all time. Big band arrangements can sometimes degenerate into all-out blastfests; Gil Evans always manages to communicate with a lot more sophistication and nuance, but on these sessions he manages to have fun as well.		Originally issued as two albums -- "New Bottle, Old Wine" and "Great Jazz Standards" -- this is a CD of Gil Evans re-arranging classic jazz standards like St. Louis Blues, King Porter Stomp, Lester Leaps In with some post-bop  standards like 'Round Midnight, Joy Spring and Straight No Chaser.		The album was recorded in 1958 and 1959 with Julian "Cannonball" Adderley doing much of the alto saxophone work. The big band included classic NY session pros like Johnny Coles and Ernie Royal on trumpet, and Curtis Fuller, Jimmy Cleveland and Curtis Fuller on trombone. Paul Chambers, Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakely and Elvin Jones make appearances in the rhythm section, and Steve Lacy plays soprano sax on  4 tracks.		It's so interesting to be listening to these records nearly 50 years after they were made -- this was a "modern" take on jazz tunes that even then were considered classics. Hearing them now, it's like listening to one set of Old Masters interpreting an even more distant set of Old Old Masters. It's a CD that you can enjoy as a peek into modern jazz of the late 50's, or as a set of very interesting big band orchestrations.		High recommended if you want to learn more about this extremely talented jazz orchestrator.
0,Obviously "The Joshua Tree" was U2's breakthrough album, but in retrospect I would make a case for "War" being their most pivotal work. In a word, this is the point where the lyrics catch up with the music. You can listen to "Boy" and "October" and find the sound, which in the beginning was focused on the Edge's jagged guitar riffs ("I Will Follow" is the best song from those two albums), but the lyrics are pretty much just something for Bono to do while the band plays on.		However, when we get to "War," things have clearly changed. If the title and the cover shot (a young boy, his lower lip bloodied, his hands locked behind his head a standard pose of submission), then the lyrics of "Sunday Bloody Sunday" quickly settle the matter. Along with "New Year's Day" and "'40'" they place "The Troubles" at the heart of the album's gestalt. The political position they are taking vis-a-vis the sectarian strife in Northern Island is rather nebulous, but there is a potency to the music and the lyrics hitherto unfelt in U2's songs (forever captured in the music video of the group performing the song at Red Rocks). But then there is nothing wrong with offering awareness and concern rather than solutions. This is a problem that has been boiling over for centuries.		When an artist or group makes it big, there is a tendency among their true fans (defined as those who were in on the action before the bandwagon loaded up after the big breakthrough album), to look back at one of their "early" albums with great nostaglic affection. For U2 that album would obviously have to be "War," even with the presence of "Two Hearts Beat as One," a song that is basically just there to dance to.
0,Beegie Adair has again presented an excellent jazz tribute and this time	to Tony Bennett.  Also, Amazon delivered this AHEAD of the time the CD	was scheduled to be released!  And they met the new price without request!
0,This is mind blowingly good. Three virtuosos at the top of their game with well composed, intelligent, fun, dazzling music. A pure adrenaline rush with a good pair of headphones.
0,beautiful, easy listening!!!!  bought for my daughter who lives with me and this has become one of my own faves....love her voice!
0,This is a legendary recording and ranks at the top. It combines fine musicianship of band members and Alison Krauss into riveting, touching, inspiring songs on two CD's. Her voice is so pure, and the songs deal with a range of love and friendship related themes that seem to come straight from the heart that, combined with the superb band members, it delivers solidly !

0,Pros: career-spanning; all of Led Zeppelins best-known songs in one package		Cons: Delves too much from the early albums; one or two omissions		.		 Led Zeppelin, much like The Beatles had such a brief recording career yet were able to spawn an untouchable legacy that only seems to grow with each year that passes by. This is the way it is in America at least; Im not sure about the rest of the world. The band recorded music as a group from 1968 to 1978, and released their nine studio albums over the ten-year period from 1969 until 1979. The British band played a mixture of blues and rock for the most part, yet they ventured often into folk, heavy rock, acoustic ballads, and eastern. Yet hearing the bands name  Led Zeppelin  it immediately conjures up a grand image of heavy metal, and not only this but the heaviest of all early heavy metal. To my ears, this is furthest from the truth. While the band was heavy at times, it was due mainly to the loud and boisterous drumming of John Bonham and the high-pitched screams of Robert Plant. Guitarist Jimmy Page was basically into blues and classical guitar; John Paul Jones was the bassist, but also an instrumentalist that brought sounds to Zeppelin such as the recorder, violin, cello, sitar, autoharp and more which varied up the entire Led Zeppelin experience. So while you're not likely to bang your head along to the music found on this double CD anthology, chances are youll enjoy their evolving styles presented here on Mothership.		 While the band did vary in styles during their career, it seems that Jimmy Page and the rest of the world would prefer to remember Led Zeppelin as a blues-rock fusion of sorts. The evidence is the ratio of songs taken from their first two albums. Out of the 24 songs here, almost a third of the songs are taken from Led Zeppelin I and Led Zeppelin II. Good Times Bad Times is one of those songs that were ripped off by many bands since. Today we listen and the song sounds simple and relatively ordinary, yet under scrutiny listening to John Bonhams lightning-quick bass drum, this must have been the blueprint that gave way to the double kick drum years later. Jimmys guitar riff during the chorus reminds me of many things Aerosmith have done in their early days. Having said this, the song is ordinary as a whole. Many of Zeppelins blues-rock songs sound similar; they deal with the same ideas lyrically, such as how the woman had done him wrong. Communication Breakdown is more of the same along the lines of Good Times Bad Times. What both songs have which appears to have dissipated later in their recording career was the bold use of back-up vocals. Dazed and Confused, although lyrically still on the same subject of being rejected by a woman sets a different mood and meditative atmosphere that may have been borrowed from a song like Knights in White Satin which was released a year earlier. The song has a history of a couple of years before its release here on Zeps debut, including a version by The Yardbirds. Page reworked the song enough to feel comfortable enough giving himself the by line. Jimmy Page uses the technique of using a bow across the guitar strings creating an evil sounding effect against the descending bass line which may be deliberate to musically illustrate the descent into an emotional hell brought on by a broken heart. Babe Im Gonna Leave You is an acoustic number, which may try to show the listener just how diverse the band is. They reverse the usual order of who is leaving whom, this time the man has the upper hand and the brief acoustic guitar riff may stretch the palate slightly, but it really doesnt get too far on this first album, or the second done either.		 While Led Zeppelin adapted an album-oriented-rock style, their early days have seen singles released from their albums. Whole Lotta Love was a top ten single and was the song that propelled the band to their huge success that never left them. The guitar riff is wonderfully repetitive and it was the middle interlude full of lovemaking ambiance that set the song apart as a new kind of style, although its really more of the same blues-rock that weve heard on the first album. Bonhams drumming seems to be brought more to the fore here, and with Pages winning riff it made the song sound fresh. Ramble On is lyrically fresh on the surface as it deals with its JRR Tolkien influence for the most part, yet still at its core its still about a king still looking for his queen. The acoustic structure and the dual guitar solo is very reminiscent of stuff like The Allman Brothers but the similarities must have been coincidental as Led Zeppelin II and The Allman Brothers Band debut were released less than a month apart from each other. Heartbreaker slightly evolves the Led Zep sound once again, this time due to the brief lead guitar solo absent of any other instruments. I wonder if this is the first instance, if it is (or even if it isnt), it has been copied especially during live rock shows by just about every band that has come after.		Led Zeppelin III has been treated as the redheaded stepchild as far as their releases go. I think Jimmy Page gives the best explanation when he said that everyone was awaiting Whole Lotta Love II, and then they put out an album full of acoustic songs more than anything else. Yet The Immigrant Song remains as one of the most infectious heavy songs written by the band, and one of the few that could possibly be seriously considered heavy metal. Since Ive Been loving You has Plant sounding as a dead-ringer for Janis Joplin, who oddly died a day before the release of III. Im convinced that had she lived, she would have covered Zeppelin on this song as this bluesy downer would seamlessly fit comfortably into her live repertoire, and she would have done it justice.		 The mysteriously titled forth album is considered Zeppelins greatest achievement by some, and its for good reason. The simply titled Rock and Roll consistently proves even to this day that John Bonhams drumming style is simply inimitable. This blues-scale style riff has been ripped off more times than there are stars in the sky. The pairing of this and the fourth albums opener Black Dog is beautiful heavy rock in all its glory. I love Jimmy Pages fab riff here, and the solo here is even more electrifying. Every ounce of these two songs will make you appreciate the more straightforward hard rock approach that Led Zeppelin had taken on this album. When the Levee Breaks is a cover/remodel of an old blues song from the 1920s, which has been covered many times including a fine version by W.A.S.P. This is one of the bands longer songs from the fourth album, but the longest goes to their most famous song ever, Stairway to Heaven. The song begins with Jimmy Page playing a quiet acoustic classical intro, which is then immediately followed by recorders from John Paul Jones giving the song a very medieval sound, and the folklore lyrics compliment the mood as well. The song is a smidge over eight minutes, and the slow buildup to the huge ending is legendary. After listening to Babe Im Gonna Leave You, I come to the conclusion that this ending was heavily influenced on their earlier track. I would have liked to hear Going to California or The Battle of Evermore in addition to the songs selected here, especially since there was room for at least ten more minutes of music on this first disc.		 Amazingly, their fifth album Houses of the Holy is almost every bit as special as their show-stopping fourth album. It pushes the scope of their music to new levels, giving the band or more dynamic and diverse appeal. The Song Remains the Same was originally to be an overture that leads into one of my favorite songs, The Rain Song. You can hear the obvious structure that an overture was indeed intended. Where Robert Plant begins singing his lyrics, the first part (or the original overture section) has now melted into this middle section that was input for the sole purpose of having lyrics. Plant then had written lyrics for the original musical section as well when it reprises after the middle section. There are a number of guitars recorded and overdubbed playing different parts, Plants voice sounds unnaturally high toward the end of the song. While this isn't necessarily a special song that stands out as far as their body of work, it marks a new direction in the band, especially with the myriad of multi-tracked guitars giving way to a denser sound. Over the Hills and Far Away is almost played as much as Stairway to Heaven in guitar stores across America. The sign should read No Stairway and no Over the Hills especially as its usually played annoyingly wrong every single time. Once again Jimmy Page combines the sparseness of a classical(ish) type of acoustic with a heavy section popping up now and again, taking turns with the acoustic section. The harpsichord played by Jones along with the acoustic gives the section a big sound. Dyer Maker (not pronounced Dire Maker by the way), but like Jamaica, which is named this due to the reggae feel. While Jimmys guitar is louder and the main focus here, unlike most songs in the reggae genre, it still feels genuine enough, yet still keeping the Led Zeppelin identity.		 Back in my youth, I was always aware of that Led Zeppelin song that sounds a lot like Stevie Wonders Superstition. Now, although I still have those thoughts, I can hear the cleat differences. Having said this, John Paul Jones cites Stevie Wonders funky Superstition as the inspiration for the riff that they used on Trampled Under Foot. Wonders Superstition was released three years earlier. Robert Plants lyrics are annoyingly indecipherable, but the funk that Zeppelin embraces here makes up for that. Houses of the Holy also has a bit of funk within the riff and drumbeat. Was the disco era getting to the kings of heavy metal? Actually their 1975 double album Physical Graffiti can sound a bit varied in musical soundscapes as the material was written and recorded over a long period of about four years. Kashmir is one my all-time favorite Zeppelin songs with its infectious guitar riff accompanied by an equally catchy orchestral backdrop gives the song a real heavy and dense feel. The Middle Eastern overtones also tend to somehow support the heaviness of the song. The last four songs are taken from their albums Presence and In Through the Outdoor. The opening to Nobodys Fault But Mine to me sounds like a hearkening back to the early more bluesy days of Led Zeppelin, while the rest sounds more like the Zeppelin of 1976, which is relatively more blah. Achilles Last Stand, sounds like a perfect name for an Iron Maiden song. While the track showcases John Bonhams galloping drumbeat once again, at over ten minutes in length, the song easily gets old before its over. I hear the machine gun-like drum and guitar riff that KISS had shamelessly stolen from for their 1977 track Love Gun.		In the Evening from their last studio album while John Bonham was still alive, In Through the Out Door sounds like it could have fit nicely somewhere on the Houses of the Holy album, except Plants vocals already sound as if they have fallen a bit deeper as they do when we get older. It sounds like he struggles to hit those higher notes much in the way he had trouble six years later at Live Aid. All My Love has a totally different vibe than every other Zep tune here. It is a synthesizer-driven track with Jimmy Pages guitar taking a backseat. Even for the solo, John Paul Jones plays the synthesizer for a solo for half while Page gets the other solo, although much more subdued than usual. Its a bit on the soft side as far as being radio friendly, something Zeppelin could never have been accused of in the past. Perhaps it is a sign that they were smart to call it a day when they did, even if Bonham hadnt died it would have probably been a good choice.		Mothership is the perfect vehicle to get introduced to Led Zeppelin. On these two CDs, it houses 24 of their measly 74 total songs (from I to In Through the Outdoor), so in essence you have a third of all of Led Zeppelins total musical output. The bonus of this package is that as this anthology was released in 2007, the music never sounded better. The remastering used every bit of empty space and filled it with loud and in-your-face sound. Its a fantastic compilation, imperfect as it is, and it probably is the best representation of the bands entire career. Having said that, all of these songs can probably be heard throughout a single day while listening to any classic rock station.		 .

0,Any time I'm pressed with the question, "what is a breakdown?" my answer is always very simple; "listen to For The Fallen dreams."		It's been over a year since this albums initial release and it has yet to grow old. I find it strange that this album is standing the test of time considering the fact that it offers nothing new. However, with that being said, this album is without a doubt one of the best two step/breakdown/melodic (combo breaker) albums I have ever listened to. Each track offers excellent technical drumming and heavy guitar work. And as previously mentioned, the breakdowns are amazing.		This is one of those albums that is super easy to listen to all the way through. Each track is unique in its own way.		The greatest strength of this album would have to be the combination of heavy drumming mixed with melodic lead guitar. FTFD do this exceptionally well. Especially on tracks "Last Dying Breath" and the epic instrumental "Changes."		This album will always be a favorite, highly recommended.
0,By the time Heart released BRIGADE in 1990, they had completely fell out of favor with critics, as well as fans of their classic seventies work.  This was only a slight deterrence, as the group was still riding very high on their mid-eighties comeback.  The critical hatred seemed to continue with this album, which is sad because it easily outpaces their previous two records, and it my opinion remains their best studio effort.  In a possible attempt to appease new and old, BRIGADE offers a marriaging of sorts between the guitar-crunch sound they perfected in the seventies and the power balladry/corporate rock sound of the eighties,and the results are first-rate.  Though 'All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You' was the big hit here, this album goes so much deeper, and wasn't given the fair shake it deserved.  'Wild Child' and 'Tall Dark Handsome Stranger' recall the Heart of old, and provide Ann Wilson a chance to ignite her firecracker voice.  The power ballads here aren't bad either(even the two Diane Warren tunes), and Nancy Wilson shines vocally on two of the album's best cuts, 'Stranded' and 'I Want Your World To Turn'.  The album highlight, though, is 'Under The Sky', a gorgeous acoustic strummer that showcases the beautiful harmony work between the two sisters.  A must for any fan of well-crafted, wonderfully performed music.
0,Let me only give a short comment about this recording. It is the best Don Giovanni on the market today followed, and in this order, by Leinsdorf, Klemperer and Guilini. Especially impressive is Sherril Milnes. Karl Bhm makes a wonder with the score. What power, what inspiration! All great artists make their inspired best. Just marvellous...
0,I think this is the best dance record for 2008, and of course the year is young but I'll stick to those words.		Andy Butler has teamed up with Antony Hegarty to create a lovely dance record. The production is excelent, everything has a purpose and fits well. Even the touch of not using synth brass is a nice touch.		This record is proof disco is NOT dead. I highly recommend all of the remixes, especially the Frankie Knuckles remix of "Blind" - just mind blowing.
0,Brava to Cassandra. Coming Forth is a creative homage to the catalogue of Lady Day. I am enjoying how Wilson has struck a good balance between her personal aesthetic and Billie Holiday's legacy for reinterpretation. I appreciate the musicality and production. I have only owned it for a few days but I am feeling this. Quality project.
0,Bought it for a son-in-law.  He thinks it is pretty cool,
0,Generally speaking, rock 'n roll isn't all that smart. Instead, it's usually adolescent, narcissistic, unaware and cliche stuff, the excuse of youthful exuberance having choked to death about 25 years ago. You can only explain its grip on popular culture by the fact that, as actual music, it demands so very, very little of its listeners. Maybe even nothing.	Blur, however, is miles and miles away from that standard.	This is one of the smartest rock records you'll ever hear. And it sacrifices nothing on emotion. From the simple, instant icon of "Song 2", which implies some small self-parody, to the full-blown abstraction of "Essex Dogs", it's enough to make you believe again.	The lyrics are playful and sharp, always. But the impressive thing is the way the band uses its instruments. It seems like some little treatment, some wrinkle, is present on almost every track, and every sound. And it never feels like a gimmick, never gets in the way. There's also a great deal of breadth to the tracks, from the melancholy atmosphere of "You're So Great" with its scratchy effects to the tranquil and moody "Strange News from Another Star" to the cutting "Beetlebum".	After countless songs and albums, you have to wonder what could possibly ever seem new and important in rock again. Unless, of course, you're one of those people  breathlessly waiting for the 567,288th love song from whomever the industry has decided to make famous this year. Blur has managed something new and important here. As good or better than their near-perfect "Park Life", this one stretches far ahead.  As much as you can enjoy this all on its own, you can also keep coming back to discover something new, and even newer.
0,This is the best collection of 70's songs that I've ever listened to. Donny does such a wonderful job.  Some of my favorites are on this album, and there are new songs for me on here as well.  I say Thumbs UP! Keep Up the GREAT WORK Donny!  I can't get enough of this one! You can really make memories with this album...
0,This is the the album that, I think, really revitalised Miles' career. The first recording of the great quintet, is an up-tempo affair bringing some needed energy back into Miles' usually introspective repetoire. Wayne Shorter is a very welcome addition to the group, after using George Coleman and Hank Mobley Miles finally found a suitable successor to Trane - and also he happens to write phenomenal tunes. The rhythm section, of course, is one of the finest in jazz history - Tony Williams, in particular, is pure excitement. 'ESP' may not be as great as 'Miles Smiles' or 'Nefertiti' but it is an exciting jolt in that direction - and it hints at what is to come..
0,Madonna's current work has propelled her passed the work of her early 80's record and into the dance scene, this single is definetely a showing of that.  Frozen is one of the best singles I've ever heard, and I find that the remix's are not overdone, like the Ray of Light ones.  Overall I really enjoy this Single.
0,Along with his violin concerto, I reckon this is JW's very best work. Words fail me when trying to describe the merits of this music. I'd soon run out of superlatives. Don't be put off by the term "serious music". Its actually very accessible listening. However, that doesn't mean that it sounds like JW's film music either. It doesn't. Its fifty times better!	Also, I really enjoy the Hovhaness symphony. Its not a great piece of music. But its a nice relaxing listen.
0,It was a rather strange state of affairs that, save for their Christmas flexi discs made especially for fan club members, The Beatles never released a festive style single, nor, indeed, ever included any such song on any of their albums. Still, John, Paul and George all managed to rectify that during the 70s with varying degrees of success but it wasn't until 1999 that Ringo broke cover and came up with something for Christmas; a complete CD of the genre! Unfortunately, as with the majority of what he releases, this was ignored (some would say criminally) by all bar his die-hard fans.		COME ON CHRISTMAS, CHRISTMAS COME ON:  Sounding like something the Glitter Band would have attempted, this is a great opener. This needs to be on Christmas compilation CD.	WINTER WONDERLAND: A singalong that chugs along pleasantly.	I WANNA BE SANTA CLAUS: A single-that-never-was and the best Christmas song by any of the Fab Four simply because the simple lyric couplings are effective. Listen out for the Beatle song reference.	THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY: Starting with some 'Back Off Boogaloo' style drumming, this is taken at a faster pace than most other versions.	RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER: Everyone knows this, so we can all join in. The second Beatle to try this, it rocks along nicely.	CHRISTMAS EVE: So slow it seems as if it's going to grind to a halt but that isn't to be negative. It's a really nice sad ballad about a man whose girl has left him. If Sinatra, Perry Como or Crosby had sung this, it would have been a smash.	THE CHRISTMAS DANCE: A Yuletide hoe-down that wouldn't have been out of place on 'Rubber Soul' has good use of the clarinet. A track that deserved a wider audience.	CHRISTMAS TIME IS HERE AGAIN: Virtually unheard until 1994, Ringo has continued to use his past as a tool and there's nothing wrong with that.	BLUE CHRISTMAS: The downbeat lyrics make this the worst thing here. It's never been a particularly good song anyway but Ringo tries his best.	DEAR SANTA: What with the plinkety-plink individual plucking of guitar strings, this harks back to the 1950s and is the longest track here. Referencing Lennon's 'Happy Xmas', the tune is reminiscent of 'Oh Darling'.	WHITE CHRISTMAS: Well this is different. Marrying the song to a calypso backing and Hawaiian guitars, it's certainly unusual enough to be quite listenable.	PAX UM BISCUM (PEACE BE WITH YOU): A surprising meld of Indian music and Latin chanting is something straight out of George's drawer. The Beatlesque chanting is broken by Ringo's "Merry Christmas" at various junctures giving contrasting images. Strange but compelling.		Compared to how he has been short changing us time wise with his last few releases, this clocks in at an admirable 45 minutes. Not only that, you get the words on the inlay (something else that has been lacking over the years with him). The surprising thing is, is that none of these songs were ever aired on the radio or television in the UK, which is a shame as this merited more. (It still does.) Not blessed with the best singing voice, which he would be first to acknowledge, he makes a decent job of the dozen songs here.		With half a dozen tracks that would have made really good singles, I'm going to stick my neck out here and say this is one of the best Christmas CD around. He treats some well worn songs everyone knows in his own way (but still remain catchy) and four of the six originals are upbeat enough to make the statement that he's having a great time (and all Christmas songs should be cheerful). One thing is for sure; this trashes anything his three mates managed.		If you're fed up with Slade, Wizzard, Wham! and all those other overplayed songs (and who isn't?) and want to hear something else for a change, get this. He doesn't try to be too cute or too clever, and he knows his limitations. I think it works.
0,It's good!
0,A very good debut album for the trio we have now come to know as The Dixie Chicks. (I believe they released a few albums on smaller labels with a different line-up.)	The songs are all very good, but stand-outs are the title track, with it's wonderfully lilting choruses, the spunky "There's Your Trouble" and the opener "I Can Love You Better".	A good start, but I think the Trio improves on their next release, FLY and really hits its stride on their latest effort, HOME.
0,1999 was one of hundreds of cds stolen from me in the 90's. A must have for any Prince fan or a younger generation of music enthusiast that hadn't known his work until his death. RIP \m/
0,love it

0,As the title says, I think this is a great album and I have been pleasantly surprised by it.  I got it 2 days ago and have been listening to it since as the pieces on it are quite catchy.  I thought that the vocals would be distracting but I honestly don't think the accent gets in the way of the music.  In fact, I think you'll soon stop noticing anything.  While the singer's range is not a wide as, say, Sharon den Adel's, her voice is still really good, she keeps to the tempo of the music and in fact her voice and the music complement each other really well.  This could also be attributed to the excellent production of the album: the cover looks great, the music and the vocals come through as one, and the sound is clear and unmuffled.		If you're looking for something more operatic like Nightwish, this is not it.  I would place it somewhere between Epica and Flyleaf, although I think they're trying to develop their own sound and I think it works, especially with the singer's distinct voice and the really good music!		I recently got The Unforgiving from Within Temptation and even though the band is one of my favorites, I got bored with it soon into just half of the CD.  Not so with Clinic for Dolls.  This is a really strong album and you'll get hooked on it after just the first song.  I look forward to more from Unsun!  (I initially gave it 4 stars for lack of perfection but an hour later came back and upped it - can't stop listening to them and wondering what a GREAT album this is!)
0,First, I'll explain why this is my first PJ album, and I didn't get Vs, Ten, or Vitology first. I listened to a Pearl Jam song at my friends house and loved it. Loved it so much I decided to get an album. The problem is, I'm a kid, and my parents aren't too big on songs with lots of cussing. So, I spent hours on the Internet painstakingly looking at the lyrics of every album, song and B-side ever by Pearl Jam. Every album had bad words except this one, so I bought it. It is AWESOME. It was totally worth the $2.00 I paid (used, on this site). It kicks off with 3 rockers, Breakerfall, God's Dice, and Evacuation. The first and the last are excellent, but the middle is my least favorite. Then I get lots more classic Pearl Jam songs; Light Years (which is my favorite), Nothing As It Seems, Thin Air, Grievance, Insignificance, Soon Forget, Rival, Slieght Of Hand, and Parting Ways. Lots of bang for the buck (or two bucks, actually) on this album. It has a very cool futuristic sound to it and the drummer is upgraded, with Matt Cameron from the ashes of Soundgarden. I anticipated the hidden track, and it's, well...pointless. Pearl Jam, with the 4 minutes you stuck on there between Parting Ways and Eddie typing, you could have added in another song (not necessarily a the end) to the album! Oh well. Anyway, later I was burned Ten, being said it was their best album, and I still don't really like as much. It's original, and it has lots of great songs, but it's too derivative. Plus, there's lots of bad words, too, but it's still a very good album. I love Eddie's voice on this album, it's more gravelly than previous albums, and really stands out. Pick this up with Ten, Vitalogy, and Vs.		Breakerfall - 8.5/10 A very good rocker. I make animated cartoons, and I am currently making a Pearl Jam concert, drawing it out and animating it, featuring this song.		God's Dice - 7.5/10 Another rocker, but is my least favorite. Is too mushy.		Evacuation - 9/10 Pure rock n' roll fun with some slow parts, but their best rocker is Spin The Black Circle from Vitalogy. (It's not about drugs, as the first line suggests, it's about  playing a record.)		Light Years - 10/10 I simply adore this song. Is the most listenable and enjoyable.		Nothing As It Seems - 10/10 Another classic PJ song.		Thin Air - 10/10 ANOTHER classic Pearl Jam song!		Insignificance - 9/10 And more of the best!		Of The Girl -7/10 A weaker track, though lots like it the best.		Grievance - 8.5 A very good track. Someone described as "cute", as I recall...		Rival - 9/10 Starts off with a growling dog. I really like this song.		Sleight Of Hand - 9/10 Really easy to get into.		Soon Forget - 9.5/10 Beautiful 1:00 song.		Parting Ways - 9/10 Somewhat overlong, but great!		Writer's Block - N/A Is pointless, but somewhat symbolic, if those two go together.
0,.. I have listened to SmoothJazz for a long time, 'N nothin' has touched me quite like this album has "Ladies Choice" .. Paul Taylor's Saxophone, excellence has a certain sound that catches the ear 'N doesn't let go until the final track is done .. The songs are well written, played, 'N leave you in suspense as to how awesome the next song is going to sound ..
0,This is such a good CD....makes you smile and want to sing-a-long.  Really good songs. Will have to buy more by him.
0,This set of Beethoven sonatas was recorded over a period of almost 40 years.  The performances are magisterial and quite brilliant technically, with remarkably consistent sound.  Most of the interpretations are excellent, though there are a few sonatas where Pollini seems too determined to push forward, giving the music a breathless quality that seems to miss some of the poetry in the score.  I disagree with some reviewers here about the presentation of the set.  Though the notes are extremely brief, I appreciate DG offering this set at a budget price so quickly after the completion of the recordings.  Strong alternatives in this repertoire come from Gilels (with a few sonatas missing) and Kovacevich.
0,I was a kid when the group broke up and had only heard the stereo mixes of the Beatles' albums. I have been a Beatles fan since hearing Abbey road at 13. I must say I have never heard these early albums sounding better than this. Well worth buying the albums originally released as mono only. I DJ and kids younger than mine still ask for the Beatles to be played at school dances. Thus proving great music is indeed like great wine it just gets better with age!
0,Pretty nice budget set. These public domain cds are pretty decent but as usual Real Gone Jazz needs a better quality control dept. Tracks 1-12 on disc 2 are from the AL COHN QUINTET Featuring Bobby Brookmeyer lp on Coral not the BOB BROOKMEYER Featuring Al Cohn lp on Storyville as shown on the cover. At least they listed the proper song titles.
0,First off, I have to say old Cannibal Corpse with Chris Barnes is the best death metal you will ever find. After Chris Barnes left, however you have two bands to choose from: the new Cannibal Corpse with George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher, or Six Feet Under. I have to say Six Feet Under is probably better than new Cannibal Corpse although Gore Obsessed gives Six Feet Under some competition. This album is great because it has the Obituary guitarist in it and Chris Barnes doing his always SICK vocals. My only complaint is some songs have the exact same riffs as certan Obituary riffs just with different vocals/lyrics and slightly different song structures. I have to say if you want to hear what Obituary would sound like with Chris Barnes singing check out this album. However, the best Six Feet Under CD's are True Carnage, and Maximum Violence. If you want the best new Cannibal Corpse CDs buy Gore Obsessed or Vile.
0,Daphne Loves Derby is pretty cheesy and a guilty pleasure, but they have genuine heart. Their problem is that they aren't entirely appealing to non-emo fans. The singer, especially, is not for everyone as he as a distinctly whiny voice. Thankfully every song is good and the lyrics are somewhat deep and worth hearing. The musicianship is slightly lo-fi indie rock with a little garage rock and acoustic guitars thrown in, but it's usually good (though more catchy than interesting I think). They certainly know how to create a great hook. It was a hard decision to make, but I don't think I could give this "5" stars. It doesn't seem to really "wow" me enough, I suppose. It's definitely not an album that most people will enjoy, but emo fans will like it a lot. If you like this album I would also highly recommend JamisonParkers' "Sleepwalker". Recommended!		Highlgihts include:	the entire album!
0,Pat Metheny has been playing music for many years, in various settings across many different spectrums of music, such as his famous Pat Metheny Group's world music-inspired polyrythmic compositions, his stint with the ECM gang of the 80's, and his more recent release of sparse, beautifully composed music in a duo with Charlie Haden.	But in every setting he has played in, he is always rooted in jazz. Recently he has been playing with an excellent trio, which includes Larry Grenadier on bass and Bill Stewart on the drums. While the fans on his Pat Metheny Group days may disagree, I think his latest work is one of his best yet: a romantic comeback to his very early days of "Bright Size Life" mixed in with his postbop trio compositions of "Question and Answer" and bringing back a fresh look at the Coltrane standard "Giant Steps".	Pat Metheny is best appreciated live: which makes this a great venue to listen to his amazing talents. The opening track "Bright Size Life" shows how his playing has gotten better over the past decades between his first album and of this latest offering. Larry Grenadier's bold, funky bass lines is a great complement to Pat Metheny's explosive guitar solos, and Bill Stewart's witty drumming rounds up the talent showcased here.	This album is a very sophisticated yet accessible postbop offering. There are a few new compositions, such as the avant garde-ish "Faith Healer" and old favourites, "Question and Answer" and "So May It Secretly Begin". There's plenty for everybody, from complete strangers to faithful fans from the yesteryears. Can't wait for the next opportunity to see him live!
0,great cd and fst shipping
0,If somehow, there are those out there not convinced that Devin Townsend is a mad musical genius, here's even more proof.  I find it remarkable that there are musicians who can continuously come up with interesting ideas, without a slack in quality, and without falling into a rut.  It's just a shame that can't be true of every band.		Devin Townsend once again has created something distinctive, novel, and downright awesome with "Synchestra".  If "Accelerated Evolution" was too "normal" sounding for you, then you're in luck, because he definitely went in the opposite direction here.  Aside from perhaps "Infinity", this is some of the most bizarre and out there stuff he's done to date.  And, like every Devin album, it is an entity unto itself.  In some ways, it's what you expect from Devin, with the huge metal sounds, and complex production, but sonically it's like nothing he's ever done before.  In fact, I would also say that musically, compositionally, and productionally (is that a word?), this is the most complex, daring, and challenging thing he's ever done.		Any specific description of the songs here will inevitably be crap, but I'll give it a go.  You've got a lot of variety here, with insane, unpredictable progressive metal epics, like "Pixillate" and "Triumph" (the latter of which features a weird bluegrassy interlude that comes out of nowhere, and a truly transcendental solo from Steve Vai), "Gaia" and "Babysong" are massive melodic metal (with lyrics that once again prove that Devin thinks about things a bit differently than most of us); "Vampolka" is a wacky Mr. Bungle-like instrumental, which serves as an intro to the thrashy metal of "Vampira"; "A Simple Lullaby" is neither simple, nor a lullaby, and is full of complex, multi-layered riffs and melodies; "Sunset" is a short but sweet melodic instrumental, leading into the super-infectious "Notes from Africa", in which Devin does these sort of odd tribal chants (this will probably be the most memorable moment, upon your first listen).  And of course, the album ends with a curve, as the closing track, "Sunshine and Happiness", contradicts the whole album with its straight-forward pop hooks.		Music is a polytheistic religion, and Devin Townsend is among the mightiest gods of them all.  I'm not yet prepared to say how this album compares to his other work (other than to say it certainly doesn't fall short), but I will say this: I haven't heard every single album released this year, but trust me, this one's the best.  And yes, I have heard the new Tool, and yes, it is pretty freakin' amazing in and of itself, but you can believe me when I say that this is brilliance beyond even that.  I don't recommend this as a starting point (go with "Terria" or "Ocean Machine" for that), but if you're already a Devin fan, this will not disappoint.
0,Awesome CD i listens to it daily and will buy again some day, thanks.
0,Having had the 2 original Christmas albums of hers in my collection already, I hesitated to buy this compilation at first. After having decided to buy it, I didn't expect very much from this album and never thought about playing it (but just to keep it unwrapped in my collection). ... Then, I decided to open and play it. What a surprise! The "OLD" and the "NEW" songs are put together very nicely with very nice sound-editing to the old songs. [Old Streisand songs from the 60's, 70's and 80's, in my opinion, are almost inaudible, compared to the sound quality of other artists' CDs.] Well, I have to give this CD a 5-star rating. If you are looking for a CD containing songs that are just listenable, there are many great titles by many other great artists for you to choose from. But, if you are looking for a CD with songs that are sung, interpreted and delivered in a delicately expressive way (given that you have never heard Streisand before), then this would be a very nice item for you.
0,An amazing record.	For those who are only familiar to Young via his association with Pearl Jam, this live album (and the later 2 disk Weld) are an easy choice.  Neil shows the world of the 70's that bar chords aren't  the only thing that sounds good with distortion.  Neil goes from clean to  amazingly heavy without breathers.	This is one of those rare 70's live  albums that moves along at a fast pace (unlike other "classics"  such as The Song Remains the Same).	A must have for those into Neil's  heavier side.
0,She is by far my favorite artist. If you have not purchased this album please do yourself a favor and get it. She is truly an amazing woman of God who has been blessed with this gift to share with others. Every song will touch you in some way.
0,Buffalo Springfield Again is a timeless classic. I've owned it in every medium imaginable and wanted a young friend of mine to experience it in vinyl. The copy I received was in very good condition - both the jacket and vinyl met my expectations. The album was received in a timely manner as well. Thanks!
0,Oh Ronnie, how I love thee! And while looking for a picture of this little EP to post on my blog I discoverd Ronnie has just released a new album Last Of The Rock Stars (the cover has a picture of her just smoking on a cig and acting so teenage cool) and you can bet I'm going to get that cuz well, this beeeatch is the best.		It's no wonder Eddie Money rang up the girl to sing her famous "be my little baby" line on his song back in the 80s and it's also no wonder this album is produced by Joey Ramone and the Ramone's producer Daniel Rey, everyone is in awe of this scratchy voiced chanteuse.		Here are 5 songs that prove what a great singer she is. The title track is a Ramones song and it is one of the best songs I have ever heard - of course it's this version that makes it so, I have put it on numbers of compilations because it's just so frickin' good.		Also included is a cover of the Beach Boy's "Don't Worry Baby" which Brian Wilson actually wrote for Ronnie back in the 60s but she wasn't allowed to sing it, now she can and she rips the lid off, there's a live version of her old band; the Ronette's "I Wish I Never Saw The Sun" plus killer versions of "You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory" and "Bye Bye Baby." Five songs by one of the greatest talents of the rock era... it's so great. Now I can't wait to track down that new album!

0,I've been a U2 fan since War came out. I was 14 years old just learning to play bass guitar. I think I memorized half of Adam Clayton's bass lines and a bunch of the Edge's guitar lines. I'd try to sing along with Bono (but that's a little too embarrasing to elaborate on). I never imagined I'd still be such a huge fan now that I'm 40. They say a person's best creative work is done when they are in their 20's but these guys just keep getting better it seems. Bono's voice has changed over the year for sure, but he still hits those highs with as much passion as ever, only with a bit more rasp and fullness. And the songs are still top notch with spiritual, thoughtful lyrics. What are these guys now? Almost 50? Impressive. I suspect the next album will be just as good. It may take another four years, but it will be worth the wait.
0,This album, while not as sophisticated (song wise) as AENIMA and UNDERTOW has some amazing songs on it. Don't buy this expecting an AENIMA or UNDERTOW or even LATERALUS like album, this is early TooL, though still in the stages of developement and not mature yet, still extremely powerful. This along with Aline in Chains's Sap is the best EP ever recorded. It rocks from start to finish. While not as long as later TooL, it leaves you at the edge of your seat. My favorite songs off it are Opiate and Hush. Already on this album TooL was questionning religion and obviously angry. When you'll hear Maynard chanting :"Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now. Open my eyes, blind me with your light now..." you'll be mezmorized. The lives tracks are especially well recorded (Jerk Off and Cold & Ugly). Opiate has it's own sort of dark side, it contains some of the most dreary music ever, which is perfect since it fits like a glove the themes of the album contains. You can't go wrong with TooL, each and every cd or unreleased track is worth owning. This is probably they're most agrrrrressssive album of all often compared to Korn's first. While this was simply a collection of TooL's heaviest songs at the time it's still worth buying but you'll probably enjoy this more if your already a TooL, a good place to start, though not the best.
0,This is a wonderful compilation of live versions of John Denver's greatest hits even as he was continuing to make them. . Here we see the monster hits that propelled him into amazing popularity and superstardom in the early 1970s. In his heyday no one was outselling his albums or out-booking John for concert appearances, and considering the incredible talents on the scene at the time, that is a pretty good indication of just how popular he was, and just how universal John Denver's appeal was. No one else sang of the wide-open possibilities and seemingly limitless prospects for a good life awaiting those who would free themselves from the bonds that confined them and just dare to soar along with him in the wild open spaces.	All the tracks here are terrific, from "Take Me Home, Country Roads", the breakthrough country-pop hit that launched him onto the public stage, to "Rocky Mountain High, his paean to appreciating the beauties of nature and the natural life. He, more than any of his contemporaries, actively caught the public's imagination regarding the wonders of the natural environment, and in a time when environmental concerns were splashed all over the headlines and the evening news, John's vision of popular concern for and stewardship of the natural world was immensely important. I love all the songs here, including "Starwood In Aspen", "Rhymes And Reasons ", "Sunshine On My Shoulders", " The Eagle And The Hawk", and my own special favorite, "Poems, Prayers, And Promises". This album represents a wonderful overview of the early work of John as he thrilled a whole generation with his own perspective of a meaningful life lived in the natural splendor of nature. I know you will enjoy this live performance of many of his hits as well as all the other three of his greatest hits albums. Far out!
0,Her father (Ravi Shankar) was the best musician in India.		Even The Beatles got much influence from her father.		Now Shankar's deserted daughter grabs the world of music.		Fom Nashiville, she sang like a bird & her band back up in fine		harmony.		Daru Oda(Former Touring Driver, Now Back Up Vocal & Flute)		isn't shy anymore(In New Orleans DVD, She was so nervous for singing).She's so cute - to me she's a scene stealer of Norah		Jones. Oda loves Neil Young so much.		Godmother of Nashiville -Dolly Parton- suddenly came out of back stage, gave audience a memorable duet with Norah...		If you pass this DVD, you're not a music lover,		or you don't have DVD Player.
0,One of the best albums ever made by one of the best bands ever to exist. Great rock album with great rock songs. You just want to turn it up louder. You may think that TP's music is pretty simple. Maybe... but there is a lot going on and a lot of layers in there. You must have it!
0,this was a christmas present for my dad.  he is a huge fan of andre rieu.  he loved it!  the package arrived on time and in excellent condition.
0,I was a big Deep Purple and Elf-Dio fan and this debut Rainbow effort is one of the better if not the best albums that Dio has ever appeared on. I think that it's about tied with LONG LIVE ROCK & ROLL as the finest Rainbow album. Another reviewer said that RISING was better than the debut but I don't agree. RISING is an aquired taste in my opinion, and it took me awhile to get into but it's still a good album. I got rid of the first issue of BLACKMORE'S RAINBOW several years ago, but just aquired the newest remaster and the treble response sounds a lot worse than from before and it sounds really distorted on my great car cd deck. There's nothing wrong with my car stereo either because all my other cds sound just fine. I can't believe other reviewers aren't mentioning the bad sound quality but I won't take off a star or anything because this album is such a classic. I guess I'm going to have to search out a used first issue of this on Amazon. Believe me, every song on this is just superb and definitely no filler on this release. I just wish that Dio could have gotten along with Blackmore better so we could have had a lot more albums from this lineup, but sometimes two big stars like this will definitely [...]heads, and that turns out to be the case. Go for the first issue if you want to buy this classic metal-hard rock offering. Took off 8/10 of a star due to the botched remastering. It would get the full five stars otherwise.
0,I miss hurrican this is a good effort to start over but we all know it never took off as Kelly Hanson is now the front man for Foreinger and is great. But so is this cd this was a long time coming just to late
0,if any of you kids ever decide that you're sick of listening to mediocre crap like matchbook romance and the used and beloved and silverstein, you really need to check out grade.  they're broken up which is a shame because i'm sure that kyle bishop would kick all those stupid kids' butts.  i'm serious.  grade's only crime was arriving about 7 years too early (late '90's for separate the magnets & and such is progress...) and not sticking it out for another year and a half or so.  if they would've, they'd have been huge.  come to think of it, probably not, as most of you kids wouldn't know good music if it took a dump on your leg.	this record is not as poppy as under the rader, considerably more metal and the production is so high on the treble and low on the bass.  but it's just as good, in my opinion.  then again, it's not like any of you kids know who grade are to begin with.
0,"This Christmas, our friends from down under, Hillsong, bring us an album full of inspiring and festive songs soon to become Christmas classics. The seasons may be flipped with December falling in the middle of summer for Australia and there may not be snow, sleigh rides or "chestnuts roasting by an open fire", but there is a common love for a baby born in a manger over 2,000 years ago. God incarnate. God amongst us. The greatest reason to sing this year and every year - sun or snow.		The first Christmas album from Hillsong in over 7 years features last year's popular radio single "Born Is The King", new arrangements to classic Christmas hymns as well as brand new songs to help keep our minds and hearts focused on the true reason for the season.		BUY! HERE'S WHY!	*  Features popular radio single "Born Is The King (It's Christmas)"	*  Video for "Born Is The King (It's Christmas)" has over 450k views on YouTube	*  First full length Christmas album from Hillsong in 7 years	*  Hillsong has sold over 11 million albums worldwide	*  Over 1.6 million fans on Facebook" (EMI Music Website)		My Thoughts About the CD: I love Christ. I love Christmas and I enjoy listening to the music of Christmas. I also love the music of Hillsong. Every CD I have listened to of theirs I have been tremendously blessed and have enjoyed immensely and this Christmas CD is no exception. One of the things I particularly love about this CD is the unique renditions of each of the traditional Christmas songs. The music is God and Christ exalting to be sure and the sound is both fresh, contemporary, and at times "folksy" but not so much so that a lover of the more traditional and usual versions of the songs would not enjoy it as well. If you want to fill your heart and your home with thoroughly memorable Christmas music this Christmas season that is sure to bless then get this CD and enjoy. And enjoy you shall!		01.

0,"Strange Euphoria" was the one of the "new" songs on this recording but it was deleted from the CD of this late 1980 release. Call Strange Euphoria" what you want, but it is a cool song and sounds like Ann and Nancy are on a LSD trip while singing. It was a great song which was not replicated on 1997's Whirlygig even though Heart tried.		A bigger crime here is the fact that the 1980 top 40 hit "Rockin' Heaven Down" is not on here but a cover of the overplayed and horrendous Righteous Bothers is on here. I saw this album in late 1980 and did not buy it because "Rockin Heaven Down" was not on here.		The cover sports one of my favorite photos of Ann Wilson with the stand-off-ish, jacked up, over-confident look.
0,I love this record; I got it on cassette back in 1989 and do not understand how it was only a hit in Japan. There are NO filler tracks on this album; how on earth was "Come Home With Me Baby" not a number 1 single? Utterly bizzare, it is such a good track! All the tracks have strong lyrics and great music. In my opinion, of the DOA albums, this one is the best by far; Fragile & Youthquake being the other two in my "DOA top 3 albums". I'm not saying the others aren't good, those three are just so excellent, actually Unbreakable isn't a good album, they should have left that one in the vaults.
0,Great renditions of Brian's music . A must have ,or  at least watch, for any Brian wilson fan .	I really enjoyed it .
0,I bought this on vinyl and got the Auto-rip within minutes. Once I started listening it was hard to stop. Everyday for a week I've put it on at least once. I am listening as I write this. Track 3 Vicarious Redemption, clocks in at 18:50, an takes you on a sonic journey reminiscent of ISIS, Godflesh, and the kings of all, Neurosis.	A side note: the vinyl release I received was a double record and hand numbered of 1000, so I bought another to keep one sealed. I'm weird like that.
0,Fun music makes me happy to listen to it and sing along. Granted, not as well as they do but I love singing to this CD anyway!
0,This is without a doubt the best single disc Kiss compilation ever! I have very fond memories of listening to this on vinyl when I was growing up. Even though these songs are remixed, it doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I think some of the remixed versions are better than the original versions. My only gripes are that it doesn't have the song Shout It Out Loud and that Paul's voice on Firehouse sounds too high. Other than that it's the perfect Kiss compilation. New Kiss fans should start with buying this cd. You will not be disappointed.
0,De Coleccio'n by Connie Francis is a fine CD. Songs are, Celos, Solamente Una Vez, InviernoTriste Azul, La Paloma, Malaguen'a, Aquellos Ojos Verdes, Beso De Fuego, Quizas,Quizas,Quizas, Vaya Con Dios, Besame Mucho, Nosotros, and Quiereme Mucho. Fans of Connie Francis, and lovers of Spanish music will like it the most.
0,I think I own every CD The Cult ever made.  This is a good album, and I would recommend it.
0,Great product!
0,BEST ALBUM EVER
0,I love this old school music, everyone should own this cd..I always buy the old school music and will keep looking for these types of CDs.
0,One of those albums you just push play and enjoy
0,I'm trying to replace all my WMA files with MP3 so I found it cheaper to buy this cd than to buy the MP3 album.
0,Herb Pedersen has been excellent as a featured performer in many groups, especially the Desert Rose Band with Chris Hillman.	This collects two of his "solo" albums and they are excellent.  Of the 20 tracks, none rated less than 4 stars IMO.	If you enjoy Country-Rock, especially with a leaning more towards the Country side, you will enjoy this album.	Also - check out "Way Out West" with Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen.  This is one of my all-time favorite albums.
0,After Brian Robertson left the band for join his new band wild horses, Gary did a world tour with thin lizzy, and one album, the sound is more complete and more hard rock, the same sound of the Gary-s album back on the street, you can feel how Gary is great in this cd, in the deluxe edition you can listen out takes and other versions of the songs, the only negative thing is from the 1st cd, is only the official record without the extra tracks who are writed in the back cover,the second cd is very good for the extra tracks
0,This is a very good album. You can hear the bilance of this mans piano playing. Very entertaining well worth the money.
0,Well Corpse fans...this will hold us all over until the next album.  For those of you not fortunate enough to have owned this EP before it was domestically released, let me inform you of what you were missing... Basically, this is a mixed EP...half covers and half original (plus one remake). This is good enough for most...the best song being the first "Systematic Elimination".  Worm Infested is decent...the covers are so-so...and the redone "The Undead Will Feast" features better vocals than the original.  Overall, only for die-hard Corpse fans.
0,Major Lance is one of the smooth jazz man.his song brang bace some of the good time.you all keep up the work,I	will be buying more cds.thank
0,Ireland's Samantha Mumba enters her bid in the teen music sweepstakes, and where does she fall?  Well, far above some that have come before her.  For one, though not readily apparent on the hit title track, she has an extremely agile vocal style, often employing her lower register to nice effect, all the while revealing  a voice that possesses a nice "grainy"(?) quality to it.  It also bodes well for her that the title track, pretty big right now, isn't even the best song on the album by a longshot. It's also encouraging that she had a hand in co-writing several tracks.  She also manages to sample David Bowie, of all people, and to great effect on the slinky 'Body II Body'.  Other standouts here include a beautiful cover of Divine's 1998 hit 'Lately', 'Always Come Back To Your Love','The Boy', and "Til Night Becomes Day'.  With any justice, this cd won't get lost in the shuffle and justifiably sustain a long chart life.
0,I've adored this band ever since purchasing Argus and seeing them at Hammond Civic Center 41 years ago.  God bless you, Andy, for steering ship Wishbone with such a steady and loving  hand.  In an era of mostly musical mediocrity the great Ash still stands tall and that means so much to me.  And thanks, A.P., for signing a tab book for me in Grand Rapids in 2005.  Blue Horizon is a quality work and another diamond in a very long chain, mate.  I'm on board into the sunset.
0,Marvin Gaye / Midnight Love & The Sexual Healing Sessions (2 CD set):		disc One:  This has the original "Midnight Love" album.  This album has his monumental hit "Sexual Healing" and this song alone is worth the price of the album.  However, the rest of the album is good but not great.  The original is a solid Four Star album.		disc Two:  This is where this set gets really exciting!  This CD is filled with outtakes and alternatives that play like a soul meditation.  They have organized these tracks so expertly that the music simply carries you away.  This second disc is brilliant.  This is one of those rare times when an outtake disc is the one that deserves a Sixth Star.		This two disc set earns Five Stars.
0,It is Santana, need I say more?  Apparently I do.  The CD works and got here early.  The music is great!
0,I don't know what everyone else is bitching about here with opinions of wanting Jones to compose and record more "cutting edge" music and all, when this release suits the bill just fine for me.  My ears tell me this is a real return to form for Howard Jones and bless his heart for it!!  Sure, he's changed over the years, but then again, haven't we all??  His songs, of course, are going to reflect certain personal changes for Jones, too .... so let's allow it, okay??		You go, Howard!!  This is one hell of a release and I highly recommend it to any Ho-Jo fan.  This is music to be RESPECTED!

0,As most people have said i think this album is the follow up to the 2005 AOTW. Ithyphallic wasn't a bad album but i felt it was too watered down compared to thier other releases but i always have the outlook of some people will get into Nile after hearing that album.		But i think what this album sets above the rest for one it has exeptional quality, although thier other releases were not that bad either. This one has more to offer though, the sound is fuller & i like the new little things they added here & there that were not in the other releases.
0,With the release of Genesis's Duke album, which featured "Misunderstanding," it was clear that the group was approaching the mainstream more and more.  The next step would be Abacab, but before that, lead singer and drummer Phil Collins would release his first solo album, Face Value, an album of longing that also details the emotional wasteland of a sundered relationship.  As if to test the waters, he did a more pop updating of "Behind The Lines," originally on Duke, with speeded up vocals and a snazzy brass section (as opposed to the soundscape of Tony Banks' keyboards, such as the instrumental opening) that would become a calling card on his subsequent solo albums.		Two singles from that album both reached #19 on the charts.  The first one was the upbeat "I Missed Again," highlighted by a strong brass section.  The other, "In The Air Tonight," a UK #2, is one of Collins' signature tunes, with its moody and atmospheric keyboards highlighted by Collins' haunting vocals, and the snarl of Daryl Steurmer's guitar.  The chorus itself has an eerie echoing effect that matches the minimalist sound, as does the electronic gimmickery of the vocals.  The song and sound then burst to a crescendo when Collins lets loose with the drums through the rest of the song.		There are other surprises present, such as the instrumental "Droned," which begins with a slow piano and violins, an airy soundscape, before going full throttle with an uptempo conga and piano section, the violin turning more folky, and Collins' vocalizing proving that Peter Gabriel doesn't have the monopoly on droning vocals.  That yields to "Hand In Hand," beginning as a sci-fi Giorgio Moroder-type instrumental (think Metropolis soundtrack) that features the Children from the Church of LA as a choir, before launching into an uptempo brass and piano soul number.  "I'm Not Moving" is the closest thing to disco Collins would do until "Something Happened On The Way To Heaven" nearly a decade later,		One of the other highlights is the piano and strings of the post-breakup tune "You Know What I Mean," the emotional devastation which can be felt:  "leave me alone with my heart/I'm putting the pieces back together again/just leave me alone with my dreams/I can do without you..."  "If Leaving Me Is Easy," with its sad sax, is another melancholy song along the same vein, but this time through the presence of old letters and the false front one put with friends.  Collins' pain is felt through the strained vocals, as he sagely sings the refrain in an eerie falsetto, "if leaving me is easy, going back is harder."		"The Roof Is Leaking" details the hardships of a rural family living in poverty, but with the hope of the coming spring.  Daryl Steurmer is on banjo here instead of his usual guitar.  Other songs are more optimistic, such as the slower and leisurely melodic "This Must Be Love."  My opinion on his cover of the Beatles' LSD-influenced "Tomorrow Never Knows" is mixed, as nothing compares to the original, but I do credit him with the swirling noise and sound bursts that duplicate another kind of trip.  And if one listens carefully at the fade-out, he sings a snatch of "Over The Rainbow."		At this point, Phil Collins had enough to create a different sound from the one he was doing with Genesis, and it shows in his wondrous solo debut.
0,In my opinion, "Travelling Without Moving" is the best of jazz/funk/pop band, Jamiroquai's, work! Who can forget the infamous video for "Virtual Insanity" and the way you and your friends tried to figure out how they filmed it (even I was surprised by how simple the technique was)?!?	I was very impressed with Jamiroquai's music from the second I heard it. Having been a fan of similar music from the Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai was a pleasant and welcomed surprise. It's unfortunate that it took three albums (along with a quirky video and lead singer) for the United States to take notice of this incredible band. Jay Kay's vocal abilities are wonderful. His voice can go from fun to loving to sensual very smoothly and effortlessly.	Needless to say, I quite enjoy this album!!!	Stand-out tracks:	Virtual Insanity	Cosmic Girl	Everyday	Alright	You Are My Love	If you want to hear some seriously good music and have a lot of fun while doing it, buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,It's a little different. I like.
0,If you're a Jesse Winchester fan, this is a must have. The renditions of his songs are perfect and really exceeded my expectations.
0,"It happens all too often with great and special things - they are not fully appreciated until they are gone." Jim Szantor, former editor of Downbeat Magazine		This is a review about, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest if not the greatest trumpet player who ever lived. Unfortunately he did not live long enough. Bill Chase and three band members died in a plane crash about thirty years ago but his music lives on and is still quite popular.		Chase's music was the consummate Rock/Brass/Jazz fusion but with vocals. It was the best I've ever heard. The music was closer to Rock than Jazz and would probably appeal to a wide spectrum of listeners. In fact, off their 1971 debut album the song "Get it On" was a #1 hit.		Chase, his self titled band, made three albums. This cd contains the best to of those albums. The first, 'Chase', the S/T album which featured five songs on one side, including "Hello Groceries" and "Handbags and Gladrags" and the #1 hit single, "Get it on". On side two was a another shorter song ("Boys and Girls Together"), and a remarkable blues song about suicide called "Invitation to a River" and it takes up most of side B so it must be about fourteen minutes long.		The other album on here, which IMO is every bit as good, though the critics didn't like it as much, is Ennea, Greek for nine (the number of band members). It is about Greek Gods and has titles like "Posidon", "Chronus", "Hades" and "Zeus". This is an amazing album.		There is a third album, Pure Music, which I've never heard but I'm sure it's good. I've seen the second and third albums offered on one CD and that's even doubly hard to get.		We now know that Bill Chase was a great trumpet player, so what could be better? How about two, make that three, no make it four great trumpet players! This nine piece ensemble was a very versatile band with an enormous, almost frantic sound. Besides the exceptional vocals of Terry Richards, Trumpet players, Ted Piercefield and Jerry Van Blair, provided excellent backing vocals as well as guitar player, Angel South and bass player, Dennis Johnson. The only non singing members were Chase himself, Alan Ware, trumpet, Phil Porter, keyboards and Jay Burrid, drums.		Make no mistake, the extra trumpets gave Chase a sound like no other. They would banter back and forth with each other and with other band members like they were communicating and I can't help thinking they were having a ball doing it and Terry Richard's vocals could not have captured the essence of the music better.		The first six tracks were all exceedingly catchy radio friendly and "Handbags and Gladrags" was also a top twenty hit in addition to "Get it On", which by the way forced T Rex to change the name of their version of "Get it On" to "Bang a Gong". This helps explains why the album Chase sold three millions copies. No small feat for a debut of relatively unknowns in 1971. Overall the album finished the year as the twenty-second biggest album for 1971.		"Livin' in Heat", is a medium fast tempo, very busy song with the trumpets mimicking Richards. There's also some nice guitar work here but as always it's the horns.		"Hello Groceries", another medium fast paced number quite similar to track ! but with a different melody and presentation. Lead vocal by Jerry Van Blair on this one.		"Handbags and Gladrags", also recorded by Rod Stewart. (I don't know who covered who) Yes, it was a great recording by Stewart but you haven't heard it with them horns. Fabulous song, the varied tempo is perfect for a horn section and on this one we get to hear Ted Piercefield another absolutely wonderful vocalist. (better than Stewart)!		"Get It On"	This was not a number one hit by accident, this is quite a song and quite a job by Richards. There is of course the ubiquitous horn section mimicking Richards on the chorus's and some excellent keyboards (Hammond). It really all comes together for these guys but I don't think this is any better than any other track, they're all that good.		"Boys and Girls Together", Piercefield on vocals again, B> is a medium paced song and one I like a lot. It has a very accessible catchy melody and could have been a hit if released as a single.		"Invitation to a River", a fourteen masterpiece! This song actually breaks into five parts, a] Two Minds Meet, b] Stay, c] Paint it Sad, d] Reflections, e] River. It contains many tempos and moods.		Sitting here listening to this album, even after thirty some years, I am amazed how fresh and imaginative this album is. This is one of those creations that never gets tiresome, never gets dated.		If Chase sounds like something you might have an interest in, then it is. If it sounds like something that you might like, then you will. I can almost guarantee it!!!		These albums were re-released about eight years ago on CD, by One Way Records a company that specializes in re-releasing great music that was never issued on CD form and that's what I've been trying to get. Unfortunately their license expired and they are currently and maybe permanently out of circulation. Still it is possible to purchase them from time to time on Amazon or Ebay.		Author's Note	I hope you enjoyed my review of this remarkable album and the extraordinary musician, who like so many others, was taken from us in his prime.
0,Today marks the 6th anniversary of Lady Gaga's sophomore. Released on May 23, 2011, "Born this way" features the dance/synthpop style of "The fame/Monster", incorporating a wider range of genres (disco, house, heavy metal, opera, and rock'n'roll), while its lyrical topics include sexuality, religion, freedom, and feminism. It was a much-hyped album, supported by a strategically planned marketing campaign. It all worked perfectly. Gaga's message that "weird is cool" resulted in a loyal army of little monsters who looked up to her, the self-proclaimed Mother Monster. Accordingly, her emphasis on self-empowerment and self-expression became the overarching cultural ethos of a whole generation. Gaga, a bold, sexually ambiguous popstar was proof that anyone could have the world at their feet, as long as they worked hard and stayed true to their vision. The admirable dedication to pursue her goal, combined with the fantastic music she produced, made her millions of fans identify with her profoundly. 5 singles were released off the album: the title-track, an anthem about equality, was instantly embraced by the LGBT community; the Bible-infuenced "Judas" became a worldwide smash; "The edge of glory", an upbeat, bluesy song referring to the death of Gaga's grandfather, remains a fan-favourite; "You & I" was Gaga's foray into the country-pop that last album "Joanne" further explores; finally, "Marry the night", written as a homage to New York City, is one of her most powerful songs and videos to date, an autobiographical epic that will stand the test of time more than some of her more popular singles. "Born this way" is a true modern pop classic.
0,Well, here he is back at a ripe age and he sounds in top form. It's John Mayall all the way and it's quite fantastic.  The band is tight and John himself is a joy to listen to, if he's singing, playing the piano, organ or harmonica.  It is one of his best in a few years.  If you like John Mayall at all, this is a must buy.  It is great, imo.  I'm not going to go song by song or band member by band member; that's been done.  The music is what it is about.  Listen to it.
0,Outstanding Musicianship!!		Conducted live which everyone wondered in the beginning, if it could ever be done "Live"!		Yes was pretty amazing music back then. Many thought a Live performance couldn't be done or "as good" as on the studio album. This album was the "shut up" for those who never got lucky to see it for themselves.		It may not be your kind of music but if you give it a chance, You will be rewarded!! And you will keep going back to it. It's got legs.		Another top 5 thing:		On my "Top 5 all time guitarists", Steve Howe is on that list because of this album!	The Band is Top Notch!!! But Steve is "out a hand" on these songs live. It's is something to watch him "work" if you ever had the pleasure of seeing him live. Mr. Howe works that Guitar!!
0,JJ Grey & Mofro will give you more than you expected, worth every penny.  You'll keep it in your carit's so good.
0,This cd is like the soundtrack to heaven for me. Listen to this album whilst drifting off to sleep. Absolute Perfection
0,"Born to Run" was the hallmark of my generation.  I first had the vinyl and believe me that record served its time on my poor turntable that needed 41 cents to prevent the tonearm from skating. As soon as I could afford a cassette deck, I bought the tape. "Born to Run" was the first CD I bought when I moved to a CD player in the early 80's.		My CD disappeared in my recent move and when I found out, I had to buy this CD again. If I could find the 24Kt version, I'd get that one instead.  This is one of those CDs that I'd call 'essential'.  Definitely one of the 100 I'd take to the desert island with me.  Every song is a classic.  I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Boss with the E Street Band in Atlanta, GA and most of the material from this CD was on his setlist--speaks volumes for this recording when he's got so many years to span live.

0,It's worth seeking out any recording from Cho-Liang Lin, whose sizable discography for Sony seems to be overlooked. Here from 1986 is a familiar pairing of Bruch's two beloved violin works with orchestra, the G minor Concerto and the Scottish Fantasy. The latter was owned, more or less, by Heifetz in his heyday, yet I much prefer the rich, soulful style established by Oistrakh. His recording on Decca with Jashca Horenstein conducting is, for many collectors, the classic version after Heifetz. I think that Lin, now 62, offers an equally musical and moving account.		the striking thing about that performance, as well as the concerto, is how naturally the violinist slips into the romanticism of the score with genuine feeling. One actually hears personal music-making, not an accomplished virtuoso showing off in thrice-familiar passages of technical difficulty. It's also a treat to hear the magnificent Chicago Sym. captured in excellent sound - no digital glare or hardness - and Leonard Slatkin seems involved and sympathetic in his accompaniments. In the concerto Vengerov is grander and throws off a big sound; Menuhin has more to say from bar to bar, as if he is being spontaneously inspired. But Lin's tone is quite beautiful, and one could easily choose his pairing as the best to come along in the past thirty years.
0,THIS IS BLAKE AT HIS BEST. IF YOU'RE A FAN YOU'LL LOVE THIS AND IF YOU'RE NOT A FAN, YOU WILL BE.
0,It's so good to be able to hear a cd that isn't involved in the loudness wars and that has been well mastered in hybrid SACD format as is the case with this very good mofi release of Chicago's eighth album.  Coming in a very nice gatefold mini lp replica sleeve cardboard format we have what is overall a very balanced album of single tracks such as "Just You 'N' Me", "Something In This City Changes People" and "Feelin' Stronger Every Day" together with strong album tracks at a nice length making this is a very strong Chicago release.  The sound quality is very good given the audiophile mofi treatment and comes across as very warm sounding with a nice depth with thankfully no compression in sight.		Given the band's propensity for very long double albums comprising a mix of long experimental tracks interspersed with more radio-friendly hits we get relatively very little experimenting here but just straightforward tracks which for this fan comes as a pleasant respite.  As they say, sometimes less is better than more and it is surely the case with this album.  While this is probably not Chicago's best album and is certainly not my personal favourite it still is a strong release.		Highly recommended!
0,As advertised! Excellent Service!
0,Lots of his greatest hits.  Good value for the money.
0,...of the '70s!		This score sure brings back fond memories. James Bond alumnus John Barry here scores a space opera that was released the same year as the Roger Moore "Bond in Space" Moonraker that he also scored.  This score has a similar epic, tragic and brooding feel that suits both Maximillian Schell's mad scientist character and the heroics of the crew of the Palamino.		If I have any complaints about John Barry, and I have almost none, because I love his music; it's very beautiful and very powerful, it's that he tends to repeat the same phrase of notes twice right next to each other, which is repetitive and plodding.  Perhaps he thought those notes were too brilliant to only be played once.  Perhaps he was lazy and wanted to milk twice the screen time out of the same set of notes.  Barry seems to have been more ambitious when he scored the earlier Connery Bond films of the '60s and early '70s.  John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith are my preferred film composers of the '70s.  They never repeat the same series of notes twice right next to each other, and their compositions are much more layered, dense and complex.		Still, while Barry's compositions are more simplistic than Williams' and Goldsmith's, the notes Barry DOES use are the RIGHT notes, notes that evoke deep, heartfelt and powerful emotions!  This creates a haunting experience.		Intrada Records once again delivers a COMPLETE presentation of Barry's groundbreaking score with superb sound fidelity.  Bravo to all involved!
0,even though there were no titles to the songs written anywhere, this was an amazing cd. i liked the original better with marz then the revisited version with abk. the flows were better and with abk, you could tell they just dubbed his voice onto the cd to cover marz. this is also a better album then black rain. so if you like marz and want to hear some tight flows with the rest of the hatchet family then make sure to get the case with the red cross. i have both and i recommend this version. mcl

The band sounds just as good live as it does in the studio. The background choir is astounding.		Vocalist Sharon Den Adel is able to reach very high notes without going beyond her vocal range. She is a brilliant and very talented musician.		As of 2009, current band members include:	Sharon den Adel	Ruud Adrianus Jolie	Jeroen van Veen	Stephen van Haestregt	Martijn Spierenburg	Robert Westerholt		connected groups to Within Temptation include:	Delain (awesome group)	Orphanage	Ayreon	Agua de Annique		In addition,	Catherine Nyland-"Mortal Love"	and Cristina Scabbia-"Lacuna Coil" are two amazing female vocalist.		This is a five star product-
0,OK, first of all, Jeffy (aron.svensson@telia.se) has no foundation for his comments. Back Street Boys Jeffy? no, sorry. sure mr bungle has more  structure to the songs but have you this cd a full listen? it changes your  mood more than a good drama, its good to listen to when your drunk, sober,  fighting, f**king, whatever. mike patton doesnt sing because he doesnt want  to. hes not supposed to be. on this cd, he makes sounds that go with the  music to complete the mood. lyrics don't fit here. im a huge fan of mike  patton and frankly i think hes outdone himself. the rest of the band too,  congrats, this is one of my favorites.
0,Great album, can't go wrong. Must have as I have listened to it from when it came out. I personally like the Stephen Stills songs better. Sound quality is great.
0,This recording is available as a CD set or as part of a boxed set with Israel in Egypt.  {BTW - The Parrott led recording of Israel in Egypt is among the finest I've heard.}  This Messiah rendition seems familiar - even if you've never heard it before.  That's probably due to the slower pacing and the avoidance of dramatic dynamic and tempo changes some conductors prefer.  Nonetheless it is an excellent recording!  The orchestra is 'spot on'.  The soloists [all six of them!] are excellent across the board.  But the star of the show is the chorus.  They simply nail it.  The clarity, precision and wonderful blending of the voices are all superb.  The sopranos don't oversing in their high range and the choral balance always seems to be as Handel intended.  BTW - I own 9 complete recordings of The Messiah and have sung in more than 40 complete performances.  One curious note:  this recording along with the Layton/Polyphony/Britten Sinfonia recording offers an abridged version of the Pastoral Symphony; as I enjoy this orchestral work I miss the full 3 minute version.  If you want a recording with a lengthy rendtion of the Pastoral Symphony, The Sargent/Royal Liverpool 1959 recording has a 4 1/2 minute version.  This Parrott led  recording is one you can put into your stereo, sit back in an easy chair, close your eyes and simply revel in what your hear.
0,This is what you expect from Big Head Todd & The Monsters...just a quality album.		Is it Midnight Radio or Sister Sweetly?  No, but it's very, very good and if you're a fan, it's a great addition.
0,A forgotten band of the Rock Era........ With a great song... Worth having in your collection at the right price always...............
0,It seems like forever since we heard anything from Clint Black, was it worth the wait? Boy was it! This is one of the best CD's we've gotten from him. Spend My Time is great, the upbeat tune of "The Boogie Man" is awesome, I can't recommend this CD enough to country music fans.
0,I have been playing this album several times!  It balances very well with the R&B and hip-hop artists currently on the charts.  Both Irreplaceable and Cell Phone sound so good back to back and Black Rose is just as dynamite (though that 32-second fade from 4:08 to 4:40 wasn't necessary).  He kept it short for 39 minutes, but this album is all the way entertaining!  George's instrumentals of Luther Vandross' Take You Out and Case's Missing You are fabulous.  I liked Softly.  Sometimes, it wants to sound like Joe or R. Kelly's albums, but George plays it down and does his own thing on here.  This album just came out of left field for me.  It's good background music for outdoor picnics this summer with its smooth sounds.  I haven't played a George Benson album this many times since Give Me The Night in 1980.  This will be another classic album for him too!!!
0,The song 'Baby Love' is the most brilliant merging of soul + funk + metal!!!  True innovators, Mother's Finest ROCK like no others!!!  All of their classic gems are here!!!  The crown jewel of Mother's Finest is the classic 'Baby Love' - which is simply incomparable!!!  But every song on this CD stands on its own as a testament to the talent, energy, & brilliance of this 'Super Group'!!!  You are GUARANTEED to ROCK OUT with this magnificent collection!!!!!!!!  Fasten your seat belts - Mother's Finest has entered the building & they're ready to ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,I just turned 46, and still love Hard Rock/Metal.  It's becoming more difficult to find newer bands that keep the genre going.  Thanks to Accept, I can continue listening to new material.  We can argue if Accept is "Accept" without UDO.  I own all of UDO's albums, so i'm happy with this arrangement.  UDO has also stepped up his game since Accept reunited. "Steelhammer" is a terrific album. Win-Win for everyone. Mark came along and rejuvenated this band, and I am ecstatic because of it.		Blind Rage allows Mark to showcase his vocal style a bit more, and he does a fine job.  The songs are all very good as well.  I enjoyed the lyrical tribute to many founding groups of metal in "Dying Breed".  Well written, and truthful about this genre of music.		This album also proves what every ACCEPT fan (and what metal critics have been saying) knows:  Wolf Hoffman is a Guitar God!  He keeps getting better too.  And if you go to a Concert, he's having a blast out there.  He is my favorite guitarist out there.		This album has 11 terrific songs, ZERO duds.  Classic Accept sound with their trademark chanting background vocals.  My most recent purchases have been Judas Priest and Accept.  Is it 1986 again?!!!  Thank you ACCEPT for carrying on the flame!  \m/
0,Matchbox 20 seems to be growing as I do. When "Yourself or Someone Like You" came out, a lot of the songs just seemed to be written just for me, how I was feeling, what I was thinking.  I would listen to "Real World," "Long Day," and "3 AM" on repeat.  Those were my songs.	I originally bought this album because I'd heard "If You're Gone" on the radio.  Fortunately, the radio station didn't over play it before I got the CD.  I listened and 'discovered' "Mad Season."	As I grow as a person, Matchbox 20's music seems to grow with me.  This is awesome music.
0,My seven year old daughter helped me decide how to rate this recording.  "Godspell" has been a staple in our household for several years now (especially since the release of the movie on DVD).  My daughter and I were listening to this release of "Godspell" and she said it best: "It's different...but I like it!"  She could not have been any more poignant.  This recording has so much to offer.  The cast is vocally strong and the revamped orchestrations are top notch.  It won't replace my other recordings of this musical, but it is a welcome addition!
0,It's Hard To Go Wrong With Fred Hammond	www.cdbaby.com/cd/deryc1
0,I ran across a used copy of Micah's first CD and I was blown away by the depth of his musical expression.  I beleive that gospel music should be transforming as opposed to simply entertaining.  i think the lyrics should inspire and motivate people to have a deeper relationship with Christ.  Micah succeeds in many ways.  he holds true to traditional praise and worship on songs like "You are Lord", "Another Place" and "Soveriegn God" and takes more of a CeCe Winans/Yolanda Adams approach on the spiritual ballads "Never Let You Go", "Unfailing Love" and "Because You Love Me".  This is a great album and I highly reccomend the purchase.
0,loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks
0,Beautiful!!! Johns voice is so awesome. I love all of the songs. His version of Without you is the best I've heard. I will never tire of his " Music of the Night " and "Bring Him Home". This is a beautiful cd and I plan on buying another one so I will always have it. Im in love with John Owen Jones, his gift of song is overwhelmingly beautiful.
0,Although the overall quality of songcraft is a notch or two below Presto, Roll the Bones is similar in style -- very melodic rock, although this one has a tendency to rock a little harder. I suppose this might be attributable to producer Rupert Hine's influence (he worked on Presto, too). If you liked Presto, you should like Roll the Bones, although if Presto wasn't your cup of tea Roll the Bones may still be likable given the harder edge.	In terms of melody, the band still shines. The title track is a positively groovy number with a killer vocal hook in the chorus. There's also...ready for this?...a rap section in this song! It's weird, but it's pretty funny and has its own element of charm, and heck, it fits perfectly. While that melodic sensibility is still here, the more hard-hitting production charges inspiring songs like "Dreamline" and "Face Up" with an absolutely infectious quality. One also has to appreciate the band's first instrumental in 10 years with "Where's My Thing?" It's not the same virtuoso material as "La Villa Strangiato" or "YYZ," but the arrangements are stellar and the solid melodies are present. "Bravado" is one of the few Rush songs with vocal melodies I'd call beautiful, and "The Big Wheel" has an ultra-catchy chorus and fun verses. And, it's been awhile, but Lifeson's guitar solos are suddenly energized like they haven't been in a long time. There's a lot of power in the solos here, especially on the first two songs.	I don't think there's any filler here...the songs are either great or good. No, it's not Hemispheres or Moving Pictures...it's Roll the Bones, and it's different...but still awesome.
0,As in every other album Ten Years ASfter put out they are on top of their game with this group of songs. Alvin Lee really shows off his musical talents on  this album, and in doing so brings the rest of the band up two more notches. If you are a classic Rock fan try out this CD if you haven't already.
0,Somewhat original, very nice -- but not better than the Mamas & Papas
0,The final Deliverance release is a nice mixing of all of the styles that have characterized the bands nearly 2 decades of existence. In his final outing Jimmy is accompanied by Michael Phillips, his faithful bassist Manny Morales and none other than Jayson Sherlock of Mortification and Horde fame pounding out the drum rhythms. It is a great line-up and for the most part the high expectations have been met. Certainly there is a great diversity of metal here which may be a positive for some and a negative for others. "The Annals of Subterfuge" and "Angst" will satisfy the fans of their early thrash era (despite the somewhat annoying distorted vocals), but I am hearing songs here that could have easily been recorded for Stay of Execution, River Disturbance, and Learn. In many regards it makes sense for Jimmy to retire Deliverance in this fashion since his career (at least where Deliverance is concerned) has been to vary the sound - always endeavoring to stay fresh and experimental without sacrificing the heaviness of the big D's sound. This is a short record, because if you subtract the intro, the Maiden cover "Where Eagles Dare" (which is very well done by the way) and the German version of "Detox" we really only have 7 original songs. Regardless, Deliverance was the first Christian extreme metal band to really enjoy success back in the day and the longevity they've enjoyed is a testament to both the quality and integrity of the music and the musicians who have participated in the band over all these years. Fortunately, we haven't heard the last of Jimmy P. Brown.
0,Forget all the negative reviews from the country purists, pretentious folky feminists and the other self-righteous folks who knock this record based on the cheesy cover art and the sweeter production sheen. Make no mistake, this is a terrific album from a great artist!!!...and it is plenty rootsy, with excellent material as well...Moreover, Shelby Lynne is a soul singer...a real, born-into-it soul singer, not some cheap, commodified songstress (i.e., she is the real deal). If you agree with such claims and find her other work to be genuine, then you should have no trouble enjoying this record for what it is. It is definitely, production-wise, a sonically bigger record when compared to much of her other work, but that is not in itself a bad quality. If nothing else, it should be of interest to the Shelby Lynne fan, as it stands apart from the rest of her excellent catalog. Her performances are uniformly amazing throughout and many of the tunes are top-notch as well.	Rock on Shelby Lynne!!!
0,I'm a huge Large Pro fan and have been for years. So I was obviously impatiently awaiting this LP to drop since I first heard about it online. I copped it shortly after its debut, and its been in steady rotation ever since. Only recently did I pick up on some of the monotony and overall lack of creative energy that is displayed through a couple of tracks in the production and lyrics. But it succeeds on enough levels that this album should not dissapoint the faithful fan nor alienate the newbie casual fan. The name on the cover alone should make this a must buy for any self-respecting hip hop fan.
0,I GIVE THE MUSIC 4 STARS, ONLY PROBLEM IT IS AN ON DEMAND TITLE, SO BE AWARE. THE ACTUAL ON DEMAND PART GETS 3 STARS FROM ME SINCE I DO NOT LIKE ON DEMAND RECORDINGS AND A FEW SONGS ARE OUT OF ORDER. BUT, IF YOU ARE A FAN OF CHEAP TRICK BE AWARE THIS HAS A GOOD ALBUM VERSION OF UP THE CREEK. THAT IS A VERY HARD TO FIND SONG AND TO SOME MAY BE WORTH THE PRICE OF THE CD ITSELF AS THE UP THE CREEK ALBUM GOES FOR OVER 100 BUCKS RIGHT NOW ON AMAZON. THERE ARE A FEW OTHER SONGS I HAVEN'T SEEN ON COMPILATIONS LIKE HOLIDAY ROAD FROM LINDSAY BUCKINGHAM. NOW IF ONLY CHEAP TRICK WOULD RELEASE A CD OF ALL THEIR SOUNDTRACK MUSIC, THAT WOULD BE A 5 STAR PURCHASE.
0,I loved this album when it dropped in 1987, when R&B was hot!!!  Pebbles was so underrated in an overcrowded arena of new artist popping up in the late 80s!!!  I was so grateful to find this project on vinyl to add to my collection.  The album is NM just as the seller stated.  Thanks!
0,Caitlin Cary originally was a part of the alt-country band Whiskeytown. When the band disbanded, Caitlin and fellow member Ryan Adams went solo. Caitlin's first album WHILE YOU WERENT LOOKING garnered praise and good reviews all around. In the spring of 2003 she returned with her new album IM STAYING OUT. By far my favorite track on the album is the uptempo rocker "Cello Girl", a song about remembering someone from the past and wondering what they are up to these days, trying to remember their name. "Beauty Fades Away" is the prettiest song on the album, that ponders the idea of everlasting love and if it will remain true after beauty has faded. "The Next One" is another great track, about being in transition waiting to fall in love with someone again. "Sleepin In On Sunday" is one of the better tracks of the album, pretty self explanatory about a lazy afternoon. "In A While" is a nice slow alt-country type song about disapointed expectations. The songs are very relatable to real life and easy to get lost in. Many of the songs stick in my head, make me hum or sing along. "You Don't Have To Hide" is a great song about asking a lover to open up. Other highlights include "Empty Rooms", "Lorraine Today", "I Want To Learn To Waltz With You" and "Please Break My Heart". Caitlin covers a variety of emotions on this album and it's one of my favorites from 2003 thus far.
0,It's absolutely fine.  I loved it.
0,A wonderful album by a beautiful voice. A couple of the songs are date, but still a gem. Solid sound of a great performance.
0,As you probably know all Therion albums have a different sound. Same with the live performances. I wondered why they chose the title "live Gothic", now it makes sense. This show has a Gothic Kabbalah progressive/Gothic style. The recording itself sounds more like a studio album than a live recording and this is a great strength but I also dislike it but it obviously has been edited in the studio a bit too much. Which is one reason in certain parts you can't really hear the crowd singing with the music like they normally do.		This particular show includes an all star cast. Probably the most popular Therion has had. The two primary singers are underground Gothic star Snowy Shaw who also performed on Gothic Kabbalah. He is best known for his work with the band Candlemass. Snowy's vocals are very weird and more Gothic than is typical for Therion. The lead female is the up and coming American symphonic metal sensation Lori Lewis (of the up and coming band Aesma Daeva). The other two is katrina lilja, a formerly unknown singer who performed on Gothic Kabbalah and who has an incredible voice and we also have Mats Leven who has worked with Therion for a long time now. The bad news is there is no large choir as in previous shows, just the four team line up. Also there is no good male opera singer. You have an incredible female opera singer (lori) but for males all you have is snowy with his weird gothic metal singing and mats with his 80's scream metal voice. Yes they try on occasion to sound opera, but they can't do it very well. While their heavy metal screams will send chills down your spine they can't hit the low notes either. For most songs that's ok, but on songs like Arrow from the Sun that require a deep bass opera voice it leaves the song a little lacking. On the more metal oriented songs they put on a great performance.		We also have the typical all stars playing: the neiman brothers on bass and lead guitar, "the drum king" petter who puts on an incredible drum solo during the show, and the hidden mastermind on rythem guitar Christofer Johnson. Recently they all left the band, leaving only Christofer from the original line up and possibly some of the same singers will do future work. They cited that they have different ideas on the direction the new albums should go and how the future shows will be performed.		 Overall this album is really good. As usual a few of the live songs are better than the studio recordings. Particularly Lemuria which was incredible. While I like the show and the live CD I'm not as fond of the more Gothic direction of this particular show. I still think Celebrators and the as of yet unrealeased Live with symphony and 20th anniversary tours will be more of my personal taste. If you are more into a straight forward rock/metal sound or a more opera metal you will like the CD but like I said it has more of a Gothic/progressive metal theme. Mainly in the form of the vocal performance of snowy.		Likewise about half the songs on the album are from Gothic Kabbalah. The other half are mainly songs they do every show or a few fan favorites (Nightside of Eden, Lemuria, Arrow from the Sun). They do some pretty crazy stuff in this show though with a really improvised version of To Mega Therion and some wicked guitar and drum improvs (of course they were rehearsed but still improvs).
0,Lots of great hits from a great artist!  We loved just about every track.
0,Listening to Carole's latest recording release is just so warming to the heart and soul. She brings you back to such fine memories of our childhood to adulthood compositions. Her voice is still outstanding, the only disappointment was not being in the living room with her to see this wonderful artist track through her career.  Buy it.... you will not be sorry!
0,With their 1983 release "Love at First Sting" the German metal band The Scorpions toned down a bit from their early RCA recordings and added more pop to the mix. Love at First Sting came along at the time when hardrock and pop metal began ruling the charts. The album is full of rockers, with a couple of ballads thrown in. Songs like "Rock You Like a Hurricane" cemented the Scorpions legacy, guarnteeing the Scorpions would be rememberd over twenty years after the release of one  of their best albums.		 Besides "Rock You Like a Hurricane", other highlights include Big City Nights, Coming Home, and Still Loving You. If you're a fan of the 80's popmetal and hardrock, Love at First Sting belongs in your music collection.
0,Great

0,When I got Home, way back in '93, I had me a bit of trouble adjusting.  Travis Tritt, has been a major contributor to the "Soundtrack of My Life.  The Truck wasn't rusty then, but I am a long-standing member, of The Country Club.  Bless U Travis!!  Lots of good music to dance to!
0,I like most songs sung by Eric Church, but especially like the song Springsteen.  His music is quite different from the original country music style, but since music changes with time, I am glad to hear some of the songs by Chief Eric Church and hope to hear more new ones.
0,great
0,Excellent album!
0,This cd is not for the typical "metalhead".  This is Reed/Metallica at there best.  Yea it's different but a fan of both bands I hope the tour and decide to do this again.  This is there Led Zep 4.
0,Singer/songwriter/actor/producer/sideman and more, Billy Swan's music is incredible! His most famous song may be "I Can Help," but the entirety of this album is wonderful for his fans, both new and diehard. He is in excellent form throughout the album! Billy could (and still can) write and do so much more as well as perform; and this CD does a great job of showing us his talent during the years he recorded on the Monument label which is now Columbia Records. In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent.		The album opens up with one terrific hit for Billy, "I Can Help." "I Can Help" made the airwaves sizzle back when it was released; I remember the radio on our school bus frequently playing this song and even as young kids we all enjoyed it very much. "Shake, Rattle and Roll" gets the royal treatment from Billy who does his rendition to perfection--and beyond! His sophisticated phrasing makes his cover of this song a very good one indeed. Moreover, there's yet another gem in "Stranger;" and I really like "Lover Please" with that musical arrangement fitting in perfectly with the lyrics; "Number One" which sounds so pensive and beautiful; "Don't Be Cruel" with Billy squarely in the spotlight; the excellent "(You Just) Woman Handled My Mind" while "Everything's the Same (Ain't Nothing Changed)" is more outstanding music--not to mention another hit single for Billy.		"I Just Want to Taste Your Wine" is romantic indeed; and I always like hearing Billy do other tunes like "Vanessa;" "You're the One" with that backup chorus and the very fine country song "Do I Have to Draw a Picture." I love it!		"I'm into Lovin' You" showcases Billy once more; he aces this as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing--but of course we know it wasn't really all that easy, Billy's talent carries him through every time. "Stuck Right in the Middle of Your Love" is very well done; and Billy Swan does a fine job on both "With Their Kind of Money and Our Kind of Love" as well as "Your Picture Still Loves Me (And I Still Love You)" which closes the album with a number that makes me reach for the replay button on my CD player!		Billy Swan has given us so much wonderful music, covers of great songs and so much more through the years; and we are all better off for his sharing his talent with us. I highly recommend this for any fan of Billy Swan; and newcomers to Billy's artistry will not be disappointed. In addition, fans of rockabilly, country and even pop music from not so long ago would do well to get this for their collections.
0,This album is amazing, really raw and personal. I wish he had written more of these types of songs on his later albums (although his later albums were nothing to sneeze at). Really good first effort.
0,This is my new favorite Christmas Album! Her voice is so crystal clear and I love the spin she puts on some holiday classics. If you are looking for something that isn't the same old holiday songs then this a great album for you. Loved it!

0,Due to the sad circumstances of his early death, a sort of earnest gravity always seems to surround the work of Eric Dolphy, or discussions of it anyway. That makes this album--along with Dolphy's many musical "conversations" with Charles Mingus--a welcome reminder of how witty and sly Dolphy could be.  Fittingly, the music here was recorded on April Fool's Day in 1960, with another musical comedian (and Mingus veteran), Jaki Byard, proving a superb prankster-at-arms.  The music here joyfully sends up everything from the "new thing" of Ornette Coleman to the stately seriousness of the Miles Davis Quintet.  The band here even does a humourous deconstruction of the Davis group's beloved "On Green Dolphin Street."  The Coleman-like Dolphy originals like "Les" and "G.W." will get your feet moving and erase any idea that "avant garde" has to mean "self-important". Throughout, drummer Roy Haynes is his usual, tasteful self, and only trumpet player Freddie Hubbard doesn't seem to be entirely in on the joke, playing with an earnestness that makes the rest of the proceedings all the funnier.  Outward Bound is a joyous record that takes all the jazz styles then current and takes them for a ride.
0,I admit this is a good album, and the band performs very well on their  debut...but it could have had more selection for music. Fred Durst from  Limp Bizkit was the Co-Producer of this record so there's a clue right  there that proves this album is worth buying...but it still lacks total  album time with 56:06 as its total time...I figure it like this: if you are  going to make an album, make it at your best effort to provide as much  music as possible for consumers and music lovers to enjoy. I would still  say this cd will blow you away from the minute you pop it into your cd  player untill the last shout of Spleen leaves. And following will be an  acoustic song written by the lead singer that is alright, but not as much  variety as on the rest of the album. Its a very good album...buy it-just  don't expect a 70 minute CD...expect a very good album with a little less  time than an hour-BUY IT!!!
0,MeShell Ndegeocello does it again!  It just might be her best work yet!  What a refreshing feeling when you listen to this CD!
0,if anyone has a chance to see her perform do it.  in a class by herself!
0,When Paul McCartney releases a new album, his fans find themselves in the midst of a contradiction. On the one hand, being a McCartney devotee means that you've long since stopped paying attention to what critics have to say about his post-Beatles career. On the other hand, at some level you really want the critics, and the general public, to like him, damn it! You want them to give him his due as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, a creative force whose every album contains at least a handful of tracks (and, often enough, more than a handful) that can stand quite comfortably with his 1963-1970 output, who's still more than capable of great things. Especially since we know that the critical bylines--that Paul too often commits half-baked ideas to tape, that he works better with an editor or collaborator to push him out of his comfort zone, that he's sometimes content to coast on his undeniable melodic genius--are actually true in a lot of ways.		And so, as a friend observed recently, we await each new record with a mixture of elation and trepidation. (After all, Paul sets a high standard - nobody likes to be disappointed.) But after listening many, many times to Paul's latest record, NEW, in the past week, I think we can set aside trepidation and give in to elation. Because this is a great record.		What most impresses me about NEW is the musical richness that's evident throughout the album. "Save Us" opens the record with a potent two-and-a-half-minute burst of rock n' roll, propelled by a crunchy riff and tight harmonies. The mellotron-draped "Queenie Eye," with lyrics drawn from a Liverpudlian children's rhyme and a raucous piano drawn straight from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-White-Album/dp/B0025KVLU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The White Album</a>, constitutes a minor masterpiece. The folky "Early Days" may be the album highlight for me, a sweetly emotional yet unsentimental look back at Paul's teenage years, set against a clean, folky backdrop. But then there's the title track, which, with its bouncy harpsichords and playful horns, would've scaled the charts in 1967. In these songs, Paul's much-lauded mastery of melody is wedded to a meticulous attention to sonic detail that really pays off.		It's not NEW's highlights that carry it, however, so much as its consistently high standards of songwriting and production. None of the aforementioned gems occupy quite the same echelon as latter-day classics on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Flaming-Pie/dp/B000002ULO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Flaming Pie</a>&nbsp;(1997) or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Chaos-and-Creation-in-the-Backyard/dp/B000AL730O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Chaos and Creation in the Backyard</a>&nbsp;(2005), for instance. But the rest of the album is so good, you barely even notice that. Every song is fully realized, brimming with inventive arrangements, impeccable harmonies (even for Paul), and atmospheric variation - witness the difference in tone (though not quality) between the joyous, up-tempo "Turned Out," the wispily ethereal "Hosanna," and the industrial, experimental (for Paul at least) "Appreciate." Even on "filler" cuts like the humdrum ballad "Looking at Her" and the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/RAM/dp/B007L96VCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">RAM</a>-like throwaway "Get Me Out of Here," precise vocal arrangements and electronic breaks keep the proceedings exciting.		Alright, sure, Paul's propensity for lyrical laziness rears its head now and again - for example, both "Alligator" and "Everybody Out There," while great tunes in their own right, might've benefited from revision. But that's decidedly the exception, not the rule, a question not of salvaging bad songs but rather of improving good ones. And interestingly enough, the critics have taken note: Allmusic.com's review of the album calls it "one of the best of McCartney's latter-day records." To be fair, the critics seem to have selective amnesia, insofar as they've been saying the same about every original album Paul has released since 1997. But this is simply further proof that at 71, Paul McCartney, far from inching his way into retirement, is alive and kicking, still capable of coming up with something NEW.
0,Whitney Houston does it again!!! This album is amazing and this album is way diffirent then her past albums. Not really any slow love songs but it's ok! This album oddly peaked at #13 on the charts but was certified 4x platinum in the US alone and sold over 13 million worldwide.		Heartbreak Hotel #2		It's Not Right But It's Ok #4		My Love Is Your Love #4		I Learned From The Best #28		My favorite track on the album is no other than Heartbreak Hotel. The song is just a great track and I remember when it was outplayed on the radio. Now I wish Whitney would come up with something like this. Make sure you pick up a copy of this album!
0,First off, it's important to know that this isn't exactly a "greatest hits" collection of Marilyn Manson songs. He was never a top 40 artist anyway. It's more of a collection of songs that were important and defining in his career. Granted that most all of his "hits" are on here: "Lunchbox", "Get Your Gunn", "The Beautiful People", "Tourniquet", "Long Hard Road Out Of Hell", "The Dope Show", "Rock Is Dead", "Disposable Teens", "The Fight Song", "The Nobodies", "Mobscene", (...)and his covers of "Sweet Dreams" and "Tainted Love". It also features his new single, a cover of Depeche Mode's "Personal Jesus" that is nothing special, but not bad. The album also features a couple fan-favorites which are "The Reflecting God" and "The Love Song". Over-all, this makes for a pretty awesome collection. For Manson fans, this is a good collection to get, not only for the new song, but for the DVD that features just about every one of his music videos. Now for those that just want the Manson songs they've heard on the radio or seen on a music channel, I suggest buying the CD-only version. If those people have followed Manson's career closely, they'll notice the singles missing from this collection: "Dope Hat", "Man That You Fear", "I Dont Like The Drugs", "Coma White", "Astonishing Panorama Of The Endtimes", and "Saint". None of those songs got much radio or airplay though. So if you just want the more radio-friendly side of Manson, then this collection has what you're looking for. But to truly appriciate his greatness, one must listen to each of his albums thoroughly and discover the darker, more meaningful side of his songs.
0,3 solid albums, "Hey Stoopid" in particular, for one LOW price. Also, "Last Temptation" is an underrated album. It takes a few lessons but gets better over time.
0,After soporific and rather pedestrian "Half the perfect world", this one was a pleasant surprise. It is still mostly mellow, but sounding more folk than jazz, and all the better for it. There is better production too, with musicians like Marc Ribot, Jenny Scheinmann & Meshell Ndegeocello adding to a tighter, punchier sound. Robert Johnson's "Love in vain" is given very contemporary treatment (and i can see how it ruffled some of reviewers here), that reminds me of Anna Domino "Songs from my funeral" (look under Snakefarm). All overall it has very organic feeling to it, with no songs standing up from the rest, but no throwaways either. Thought it was really audacious for Bill Wyman, whose worth is 80 millions or so, to write a song with the lines like "You got palatial mansions; I got rented flat. You got Persia kittens; I got tabby cats...", etc.- but that's a rather minor hiccup. Think this interesting singer finally moving in the right direction, more Patricia Barber than Norah Jones.
0,Just like any other piece of art, it is subjective.  I like Smash Mouth music, so I think this compilation is very good.  I enjoyed all the songs, but really my favorites are 5 or 6.  However, none of the others offend.
0,THANKS GREAT CD
0,This a good place to start with D&V. This is their second record, but it came out just three months after the first and builds on that record.  Get both.
0,This is the best CD!  I listen to it everyday without fail and I've had it for more than a year. I'm not gonna say that it captures any specific era because I'm only 18 years old and wouldn't know about what music was on the  top of the charts in the 70's and early 80's, but it captures my dancin'  feet when I'm lookin' for a good time. Doesn't that just sound deliciously  cheesy?  Buy this CD NOW!
0,THIS WAS A NEAR PERFECT GET TOGETHER OF SONGS FOR TOM AND THE HEARTBREAKERS.  SOMETHING THAT JUST GETS TO ME IS THAT PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING HOW YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS OR TOMS TRAVELING WILBURYS STUFF ISN'T HERE.  ITS NOT ON THIS CD OR THE GREATEST HITS ONE FROM 1994 SINCE ALL THAT STUFF WAS HIM AS A SOLO ARTIST OR IN A DIFFERENT GROUP.  THATS LIKE ASKING TO PUT SONGS FROM JOHN LENNON OR PAUL MCCARTNEY ON THE GREATEST HITS OF THE BEATLES.  IT SHOULDN'T BE DONE.
0,I revisited this recording after many years as I was rather taken aback by some negative reviews which were especially uncomplimentary about Price, Luchetti and Solti's conducting.		It is true that Solti has always gone for the drama of this piece but I don't really see how one can deliver such a red-blooded work as if it were Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. It is unashamedly, unabashedly operatic and thus very different from any other Requiem; its closest relative is in fact Mozart's when it comes to the prominence and emotive nature of the soloists' contribution.		The emotions here are so very human: terror, shame and supplication; I have no problem with Solti's approach, especially when it is delivered by such a secure and spirited orchestra and choir; Margaret Hillis's Chicago Symphony Chorus is simply the best I know in this work. Despite some apparent vocal disparity, this is a very homogeneous team of soloists, too: Baker and Price work very well together in the Recordare and are at least as unified as Solti's earlier team of Sutherland and Horne. Baker's mezzo should be a size too small but such is the concentration of her tone and the weight of her phrasing - admittedly taking her to the limits of her lovely voice - that she produces a moving and plaintive account of her music; her pianissimi are very effective and she has enough power to hold her own in the ensembles.		I am mystified by criticisms of that great and under-valued tenor Veriano Luchetti, who seems to me to deliver here one of the very best and most heroic accounts of this very difficult tenor role. He has a lovely tone, is tender and restrained in the Ingemisco and the Hostias - very far from "leather-lunged", his timbre quite often sounding similar to that of Villazon. Van Dam is noble, steady and beautiful of voice, really showing off the black intensity and sleek legato of his sonorous bass, even if low notes can be submerged.		The real problem is Leontyne Price's swooping and the competition of her younger self for Karajan, in what is for me the best recording of all in the La Scala version for Karajan on DVD. Yes; her voice has become at times a tad screechy and the low notes are cloudy, yet set against modern exponents she shines by virtue of the amplitude of her tone and the fact that she really sounds as if she is imploring the Almighty for mercy. Her "sed signifer, her floated B flat in the "Libera me" and her concluding top C are all mightily impressive. There are blowsy moments but she is still in command of both her voice and the role; some of the "swooping" is portamento for expressive purposes and some just sounds a bit laboured but she remains imposing.		The sound is superb: the Dies Irae bass drums are amplified by the apt acoustic of the Medinah Temple and similarly the trumpets ring out majestically. (Someone drops something metallic 7:21 in the opening Kyrie - no matter.) Solti's tempi strike me as just right; for all that I like Reiners marmoreal approach, Solti keeps things moving better, especially at what is for me the crucial point in the Offertorio when "Quam olim Abrahae" is introduced and then reprised - that's where the momentum really must pick up fast and Solti knows how to do it. I also love the swing he gives the 6/8 rhythm of the opening of that movement; surely it's a mistake to attempt to sanctify this blood and thunder work by adorning it in priestly robes?		Comparisons with more recent recordings by such as Muti (indifferently sung), Barenboim (graced by Jonas Kaufmann but otherwise not so very distinguished) and Pappano (really quite bland) should make us re-appreciate the virtues of this recording.
0,This is definitely Mr. Parsons' best project.  His guest vocalists include David Pack and Chris Thompson, and the whole album just flows from one gem to the next.  Particularly impressive are "Turn It Up, "Back  Against the Wall," and "Mr. Time."  However, the whole  package is superb.  His whole repertoire is filled with great recordings,  but this one is the best.  Too bad he couldn't get these guys for his  "Time Machine" album----it pales in comparison.
0,for me to listen to other than Ravel.  Shimmering, crystelline music, so very pure.
0,This EP is great.  I still like Tim's vocals and he does a good job making the Something Wicked Trilogy his own.  The new song is great.  But I didn't expect anything less from Schaffer and company.  The original trilogy by Matthew Barlow was great but this new version fits with the concept album coming in the winter.  It is a good opening shot from one of the only real metal bands in the US doing good music.
0,I've been a fan of Trey's voice for a long time. He is one of the most underated male singers of all times. Congratulation Trey for your voice and the album.
0,OK this is their first album as rancid,is kinda great ,is kinda heavier than their following,is great and stuff....I think it needed a little bit of lars solos and yells for consolidate it but is just the vbeginning of all rancid's masterpieces
0,Fast Service, Great Purchase.
0,THE BAND: "The Wailers" (1972-1981) are Bob Marley (lead vocals, guitar, percussion), Peter McIntosh (piano, organ, guitar), Bunny Livingston (congas, bongos), Aston Barrett (bass, percussion), Carlton Barrett (drums & percussion), Karl Lindo (keyboards), Karl Smith (guitar), Donald Kinsey (guitar), Julian Marvin (guitar)... and other assorted players over the years.		THE DISC: (2001) 20 tracks in chronological order of release - clocking in at approximately 78 minutes. Contains a 19-page booklet with page by page song listing, the album the songs came from, the year released of each song, numerous pictures, band members, and thank you's (no lyrics). Digitally remastered sound. Label - Tuff Gong / Island.		COMMENTS: "One Love" is a wonderful CD. A notch better than "Legend" due to 5 extra songs and crisp remastering. You'll find 14 of the 15 songs from "Legend" here (minus ""Satisfy My Soul"). The necessary extra songs you get are "Iron Lion Zion", "So Much Trouble In The World", "Roots, Rock, Reggae", "Turn Your Lights Down Low" and the hit or miss bonus "I Know A Place" (never released). This compilation grabs from most of Marley's popular works... 2 songs from the CD "Burnin'", 1 from "Kaya", 1 from "Natty Dread", 1 from "Survival", 1 from "Confrontation", 2 from "Uprising", and a stunning 6 from his most succesful studio album "Exodus". You also get a better rendition of the "Redemption Song" featuring the whole band and not just Marley and his guitar. There are a few tunes I miss from "Kaya" and 2 tunes in particular I miss from "Natty Dread" ("Lively Up Yourself" and "So Jeh Seh"). If you own no Marley, this is THE place to start. Nice liner notes and photography as well - the sleeve cover photo is one of the best naturally posed pictures of Bob Marley I can remember. When you think of the MASTER of reggae, you MUST think of Bob Marley... and this is his best single compilation to date. Seems like it was just last year when he died (1980)... the time flies by and his music still sounds fresh and current. The legend lives on! Great disc.
0,Good zCd.
0,To my knowledge the term "shredding" wasn't around in 69, but this gentlemen certainly was capable of doing so to a Hammond organ. This was my very first 8 track. Needless to say I wore the damn thing out. I never heard an organ played with such raw passion. The riffs on Would You Be Happy still gives me "rushes" It just gets so powerful. . Stormy Monday is more of the same intensity ,Lee making his B3 scream. I have never heard that classic played better, & with more feel'n than Lee's version. I have never heard anybody duplicate the sound that which Lee Michaels delivers on this cd. This one is a must for Lee Michael fans. It don't get better than this.
0,Back in 1997, neo soul was resurected from a artist who pulled grammy awards with her groundbreaking debut.  That artist today is known as Erykah Badu, and though that album was a commercial success, I disagreed with the masses when I discovered Adriana Evans.  I happen to be watching The Box Music Network (yeah, ya'll I went back with that one) and someone requested her "Seein is Believin" video, and I was blown away.  I went and bought her album (which at the time was soo hard to find), and after one listen she had me.  Now, I'm not saying that she is better than Erykah Badu, however, this album was by far the best soul album of 1997 that was highly overlooked.		Top notch production from underrated soul producer Dred Scott, this album gives you authentic soul with a hip hop edge that everyone can vibe, step, and groove too.  "Love is all Around", the head knocking "Reality", "Hey Brother", "Love Me", "Swimming", "In the Sun" just nothing but smooth classic soul that neo soul lovers crave. "Trippin" and "I'll be There" slows the tempo down, not too much, but just right to keep the overall tone of the album fresh and smooth. The only knock, and this is me nit picking, but she can hit the high pitches a little bit too much and can get irritating to casual music listeners, but for those neo heads out there, it shouldn't bother you one bit.		5 stars.  A must have!! A masterpiece!!! Go Get It!!
0,I bought this album on a whim while I was visiting with friends, and listened to it on my headset, and it was great. "Likufanele" is the best song because it blends African singing with sexy jazz.  If you want an album to chill out to, grab "Simple Things."
0,This album is SICK! I bet they listen to their own stuff when they are ridin' around in their El Camino!
0,Awesome CD, Highly recommend.
0,great!
0,During the enormous success of ''Off The Wall'', Michael Jackson began working on ''Triumph'' with his brothers. In between ''Off The Wall'' and ''Thriller'', the ''Gloved'' one was quite busy, leading his voice/writing talents to various artists-Minnie Riperton, his sister LaToya Jackson, Diana Ross etc. Indeed Jackson was occupied with musical projects during 1980-1982 and on top of that recording a solo album must have taken a toll on the superstar.	''Thriller'' was originally entitled ''Starlight'', however that title was quickly replaced with the original title. Whatever one may think of Michael Jackson's personal issues, you simply can't dismiss his music abilities. He is perhaps one of the best male artists to ever grace this earth. ''Thriller'' sold a staggering 51 million copies and it still remains the biggest selling album of all time. Not mentioning it earned the pop wizard 8 Grammies in 1983.	''Wanna Be Starting Something'' kicks off the album with its percussion-driven rhythm. The offering is an underrated gem and among my faves on the ''Thriller'' album. Its anger at gossip and feeling of betrayal seemed relevant in the years to come. He even offers moral advice ''If You Can't Feed Your Baby, Then Don't Have A Baby, And Don't Think Maybe, If You Can't Feed Your Baby'' to those getting pregnant who can't comprehend the consequences of raising a child. Another highlight, written by Jackson as well, includes Beat It. The ''non-violence'' anthem had a positive message attached to it. The guitar solo, performed by Eddie Van Halan, is superb giving the song an overall rockier sound. It's still considered an favourite of mine and the video supports the song quite well. Having written a total of 4 songs for the ''Thriller'' album, Jackson contributed with his perhaps most popular song ever ''Billie Jean''. One simply can't state how brilliantly this song is. The tale of a woman as the predator had everyone doing the famous Moonwalk. Even to this day it still gets played at clubs and parties. The Jackson/McCartney duet ''The Girl Is Mine'' is a sugary ballad and the weakest offering on the album. Quite ironic as it was the lead single from the album.	Rod Temperton contributed with 3 songs ''Baby Be Mine'' ,''The Lady In My Life'' and ''Thriller''. The former is a nice mid-tempo tale of a love song. The bubbling chorus is catchy and lures you into the song. ''Lady In My Life'' is one of Michael Jackson best vocal performance, especially the begging toward the end of the song is simply amazing. Easily one of Jackson's best love song. ''Thriller'' is perhaps best-known for that ''scary'' video that accompany the song. It has been voted as the best music video of all time in numerous polls around the world and rightfully so.	The underrated gem ''Human Nature'' shows a tender side to Jackson. The sensual mid-tempo is among Jackson's best ever. However it doesn't get the respect it truly deserves. SWV used a sample of ''Human Nature'' and turned it into a smash of a song. Giving the original one some of the attention that it's truly deserving of. ''PYT'' is the most ''popish'' song on the album, its cute and catchy sound makes you listen to it a couple of times. Along with ''The Girl Is Mine'', these two are the weakest offerings on ''Thriller''. They are still enjoyable however.	The Special Edition of ''Thriller'' offers you several treats. The unreleased ''Carousel'' is a nice ballad, however upon hearing this version, it is evident why it didn't make the final tracklisting, ''Carousel'' wasn't strong enough and its sound doesn't suit the ''Thriller'' album at all. Someone In The Dark was originally used for the E.T storybook and it is nice ballad as well. The Demo version of ''Billie Jean'' allows fans to get a closer glimpse of Jackson's work habits. Vincent Price's original rap on the song ''Thriller'' is included as well giving the listener a chance to hear the entire section. Included as well are interviews with the producer Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton.	''Thriller'' put Michael Jackson on the map internationally. He suddenly gained lesions of new fans across the world. The ''Thriller'' album is a classic in every sense of the word and I would highly recommend the disc to anyone who enjoys great pop music. I would have given the album 5 stars hadn't it been for dull ''The Girl Is Mine''. ''Thriller'' is a great record to start your Michael Jackson collection with.	Overall Rate: 9.8/10
0,40 years down the road....You really, really wouldn't believe it......These old buzzards are so freekin great in a small venue like Bridge Street....300 seater.....I damn well thought I was gonna cry....I think I bought this CD either @ the show or soon afterwards on Amazon.....& almost think I've worn out the wretched thing....Buy it...The piteful amount you spend on it will pay you back 20 fold in enjoyment.....
0,This review is about the Blu-Ray audiophile release. Of course, the music is 5 stars. This review is not about the music.		This is a stereo release--I know there are going to be a lot of sad faces out there because this isn't multichannel, including mine. It's INCONCEIVABLE that the original multi-channel tapes don't still exist, and I still hope that Stevie will do the right thing or let someone else do the right thing with a multi-channel release.		With that said, this is glorious. This album has always sounded lush and detailed and amazing compared to most everything else in contemporaneous pop music.		This Blu-Ray release is something else.		I couldn't turn it up loud enough to make it sound annoying. Well, I can always annoy my wife: "Jeebus! The neighbors!"		While it doesn't say it on Amazon, the Blu-ray includes all the bonus single songs (Ebony Eyes, et. al.)		This is one of the most perfectly produced and mixed records ever. I present As as case in point. On this Blu-Ray, the percussion is detailed, takes over the room and I just cannot stop listening to it.
0,And that's just fine with me. Does seem like SOME of these tracks could be B-sides from the first album. But there are definitely some great songs here. I don't know how this could be compared to Air exactly. Same genre of music, completely different vibe. Zero 7 has redefined the meaning of "chill." If you liked the first album you'll like this one too. That's the bottom line. If you've never heard Zero 7 before, go get Simple Things first.
0,Some good solid country style rock. Typical Nashville production, but good material performed by pro's
0,ALICE COOPER-WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE: After eight albums as highly influential shock-rockers, the original ALICE COOPER band split up over the usual "creative differences", leaving frontman VINCENT FURNIER to assume the monicker; the dark, highly theatrical concept album WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE was the result. Despite the usual twisted and macabre fare, the biggest jolt was the atypical ballad ONLY WOMEN BLEED, whose poignant theme of battered females touched off a series of surprisingly mellow hits over the next few years. NIGHTMARE's atmospheric title track, the slick tongue in cheek anthem DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH and necrophiliac tribute COLD ETHYL proved closer to class-sick ALICE, with LOU REED guitarist DICK WAGNER, future KING CRIMSON bassist TONY LEVIN, DETROIT WHEELS drummer JOHNNY "BEE" BANDAJEK among the hired guns (VINCENT PRICE also makes a cameo). WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE may have lacked the hard rock muscle of earlier albums like SCHOOL'S OUT and BILLION DOLLAR BABIES, but it remains the provocative peak of ALICE's solo career, spawning a sequel several decades down the line.		RATING: FOUR SHRIEKS
0,With exception of two songs which I have never heard, this cd is fantastic.  I love inspirational music and Jeremy Camp is at the top of my list.  Great songs
0,Great music!! Love it and so uplifting!! You'll want this, for sure!! Some of my grandkids favorite songs on this album!
0,A little bit of a departure from other Black Lillies albums as it has some sort of pop and r & b songs.  However, there is still plenty of their famous alt. country rock sound.  One song that really stands out is Broken Shore.  The words and the build-up to climax melody is a lot like Where The Black Lillies Grow from an earlier CD.  Don't miss them in concert if they come to your area.  They rock!
0,Love this ASK-81 Christian Karaoke Songs of Praise. My Grandchildren enjoy singing along.

0,Baby-boomers both black & white in the sixties must have all been in awe of Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions who were scoring one incredibly great hit after another starting strong with the hypnotic "Gypsy Woman", hitting it out of the park with "It's All Right"...still remember those old ABC Paramount 45rpm's spinning endlessly from one great hit to another & each great song had a message and before long one realized an important one for equality and humanity in general. "I'm So Proud" is a gorgeous love song in the midst of profound message anthems followed by "Keep On Pushing", a struggle for equality and that awesome classic "Amen" from "Lillies Of The Field".  Each new release became a powerful social statement but with an engrossing musical appeal that made it go down so easy and "People Get Ready" defined the sixties and really became a anthem for all times...timeless classic sounds as hopeful & tremendous today as the day of release and easily can bring one to tears with its profound beauty! Curtis played all instruments and rhythm was in his soul shining brightly in "Woman's Got Soul" with great tempo changes that have a feel all of its own...another group classic "We're A Winner" is a timeless feel good song that defines Black Pride for all times & "Choice Of Colors" leaves one speechless but is musically so satisfying to listen to with glorious vocals amidst engrossing tempo changes...nobody gave more to this cause than Curtis Mayfield and all accolades are well deserved.	The Curtis Mayfield Story just may be one of the best and most important box sets in Compact Disc history as it covers all the great years of this amazing singer/composer/musicans remarkable career cut way too short by a tragic accident but Curtis did go on after to record another amazing musical treat for all to savor and enjoy.	One could write a book about this amazing legends magnificent accomplishments but best just get yourself this incredible set and get ready for the musical treat of a lifetime...Curtis is AWESOME and this collection is a totally engrossing musical journey...solo years take it to the next level and then some and that is really saying something!!! This is a truly legendary collection...	BRAVO CURTIS!!!
0,The nation has voted and I predict that this album will continue to have good reviews.  This is my first Guns N'Roses album I have ever bought and I am glad I did.  I am well aware of their previous works but I was never a fan.  After hearing that this album took more than a decade and 13 Million dollars to make I just broke down and bought the album out of curiosity.  So of course I approached it with a cynical ear, cause I am thinking how can Axl Rose think of himself that important?  After listening to this album I still think that Axl Rose is pompous but their is no denying that "Chinese Democracy" is a fine work.  Why the four stars instead of five?  Well after a decade it's not a masterpiece, but it deserves to be in the realm of excellent.  The album is very detailed and it has a bit of hip hop, industrial, electronic, and world influences but it's uses rock as a strong vehicle.  This album is an example of succesfully fusing styles without sounding cliche.  The first three tracks are worth your money alone.  Chinese Democracy, Shakler's Revenge, & Better boast of pure energetic rock!  It follows with power ballads laced with real Paul Buckmaster strings.  The album has it's slow moments for me, but that is all  a matter of taste.  It finishes strong, and when the album is done you feel happy that there are some people out there who care about perfection.  Why do albums like Boston's Third Stage and so many others take many years to make?  Beside their legal problems it's the people at the helm that demand musical perfection.  Many times when albums take years to make it doesn't come out very good.  In this case it did, but I still believe that this album could have taken one year to make, cause I can list ten album done in less than three months that I consider masterpieces.  Nevertheless, this album is a model of coherent fine work.  The mix, musicianship, production were all taken to high standards.  Why not spend your entertainment dollars in this damned economy on music that was taken to great detail?
0,THEIR BEST ALBUM OF THE NEW MODERN, MORE COMMERCIAL SOUNDING AEROSMITH. THE OTHER TWO TO OWN ARE ROCKS(1976) AND, TOYS IN THE ATTIC(1975). THESE THREE ARE ALL EXTREMELY GOOD, CLASSIC ALBUMS. ALL THOUGH OTHERS HAVE THEIR HIGHLIGHTS, THEY NEVER REALLY ACHIEVED THIS AGAIN!
0,Simple: The best Misfits collection. Perfect for collectors or Misfits fan. If you don't know Misfit just buy it and you will be a real fan !!!
0,If it's Guy Penrod, I have to have it. His voice is amazing.
0,Wow this was the first Dethklok cdvI ever bought and boy was it good, my fav song on the disk is The Cyborg Slayers
0,I remember hanging out with my younger brother, listening to music, and marveling over our imposing 'hi-fi' systems 'back in the day'.  I'm sure we drove our parents nuts, with 3 music loving sons in the household, each with their OWN 'kick butt' systems. At any one given time, the house was always shaking and rattling! In any case, 'BOSTON' and this Barry Goudreau album were always in 'heavy rotation'.  This is an EXCELLENT release, with hooky, catchy, melodic 'guitar driven' music, largely in the vein of classic 'BOSTON', but a bit more bluesy and even boogie at times.  All the songs are real good, but the shining diamonds here are 'Hard Luck', 'Dreams', and 'Life Is What We Make It'.  All in all, a STELLAR rock release, that sounds as fresh now as it did then!
0,Fantastic music from Vince Giordano, plus a few classic recordings, makes this a joy to listen to. The 180g vinyl is superb!
0,great old albumn
0,This one is the bomb, baby, this is the album that hooked me like a fish and hung me out to dry.  I first heard "Do You Right" (circa 1993) and that was it.  I stole it from my girlfriend so I could hear it  all the time.	"Music" is just that.  From the reggae hook at  the beginning of "Welcome" to the body-slam beats of "Freak  Out", "Fat Chance" and "Feels so Good", this album  is the all-time party record.  I went to see these guys in early 94 at a  tiny club in Santa Barbara with Sublime... the show burned my ears  off.	Stop criticizing 311s newer albums.  Just accept that all good bands  want to evolve their sound, try new things, experiment.  All bands get  bored doing the SAME THING.  Even Metallica got bored.  Just get down on  your knees and thank the Music gods that 311 made this album at all.
0,Somber. Affecting. Clever. Did I mention somber? Sort of like Tori Amos and Lorde's love child. Playing video games now makes me very self-conscious.
0,Track #9 on Disc 1 is by "Medway" not Madway as listed here.
0,This CD is one of the best in the history of music, as far as rock is concerned, only Zeppelin 4, and "Who's Next?" surpass it. "Kashmir", "Houses Of The Holy", and my favorite Zeppelin song "Trampled Under Foot", are on side one, and it makes this CD a must have alone. The rest of disk one is not far behind.  I cannot believe people writting in here being so negative towards it (They must be angry Who or Stones fans, who hate the fact that Zeppelin is viewed over them). As far as Zeppelin CDs are concerned here are my rankings:	 1: Zeppelin 4: "Stairway To Heaven", "Black Dog", "Rock And Roll" etc.	 2: Physical Grafitti.	 3: BBC Sessions: Best live CD EVER except "For The Last Time (George Strait).	 4: Zeppelin 2: EVERY song but "Thank You" and "Lemon Song" are 10/10.	 5: Houses Of The Holy: Title track, "The Rain Song", "Dancing Days" etc.	 6: Song Remains The Same: Killer versions of "Stairway". "Celebration Day" and "The Rain Song", excellent "Immigrant Song".	 7: Zeppelin 1: "Communcation Breakdown", "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You", "Good Times, Bad Times" etc.	 8: How The West Was Won.	 9: In Through The Out Door: "In The Evening", "Fool In The Rain", "All Of My Love".	 10: Zeppelin 3: The most overated Zeppelin CD EVER, best song "Immigrant song" is better live. (Has the WORST non-Coda Zeppelin song: "Hats Off To Roy Harper"	 11: Presence" Only Achillies Last Stand" and "Nobody's Fault But Mine" are worth the money.	 12: Coda: Nothing on it that justifies the cost.	  Finally, this CD should be in ANY rock fan's collection, because NO artist out today can touch it.
0,Bert Jansch's "Rosemary Lane" was a favorite back in the day; and this set sat in my wish list queue for quite a while before I popped for it on a splurge day.  The title track is exquisitely gorgeous and lyrical, "Sometimes it seems we are motionless, caught between time & space."  Beth Orson handles the vocals on the blues inflected slide guitar piece "When the Sun Comes Up."  "The Old Triangle" is a lovely track, familiar to me on an old record by Ian & Sylvia, whose melody Jansch polishes lovingly.  "Bring Your Religion" is a haunting track, "Pray for the Earth & the whole universe."  The instrumental "Magdalina's Dance" is gorgeous with the Bolivian flute adding a haunting feel to the track.  Yes, Jansch's voice is a little thin on a couple of tracks, but that's part of the deal.  Adam Jansch's album cover certainly captures my eye.  This is a strong set from one of England's great folk artists.  Enjoy!
0,Love Chris' gravelly voice - great CD!
0,The O'jays represent what evil cannot destroy.
0,U2 is a legendary rock band and RATTLE and Hum is the moment when they conquer the world...Well, JOSHUA TREE was this moment, but RATTLE documents this time, plus got a lot of great great songs! U2 is undoubtly one of the greatest things to happen in the music history, and BONO is a very cool guy who cares about this planet! THANK YOU, U2! YOUR GREAT MUSIC WILL LIVE FOREVER!!!!
0,If you think all there is to Rossini is Overtures, then you are in for a treat with this Double Decca title.  Collected on this two-disc set are Rossini's 6 String Sonatas, lovely three movement works written in the composer's youth and only rediscovered after WWII.  They are not the most complex of works, but are thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.  Neville Marriner leads the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in these analog recordings from the mid-1960s, which also include works by Donizetti, Bellini and Cherubini.  There is a competing Philips Duo title of the String Sonatas, but I opted for this one because one of my favorite recordings of Rossini's Overtures is also by Sir Neville (recently reissued in UNI's "Trio" series).  Marriner once again shows that he is more than just Mozart.
0,Scotty has a bunch of quality, radio-friendly songs on here, and I think this may be his breakout album.  "See You Tonight" is a huge leap from his debut CD, with much stronger songs from top-to-bottom.  Scotty also co-wrote 5 songs on the album, including the title track.		"Feelin' It" is instantly infectious - an upbeat and catchy song with clever lyrics.  It features a crisp melody, toe-tapping beat, and sounds like it has the potential to be a huge summer smash - I wouldn't be surprised if it went all the way to #1.  "Forget To Forget You" is also extremely well written, has a super catchy hook to it, and screams "hit".  "Feel Good Summer Song" is opposite what you would think - it's a powerful ballad with heartfelt lyrics - a gem which hopefully will become a single at some point.  "Carolina Moon" is another soothing tune that showcases Scotty's wistful vocals, along with Alison Krauss and her sweet harmony.  "Something More" carries an honest message about wishing there were more songs on the radio covering topics other than trucks, parties, and beer.  Overall, this album is impressive, and very balanced - modern country at its best.  Highly recommended!		Check out:  "Feelin' It", "Forget To Forget You", "Carolina Moon".
0,This is the best album Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have done in years. Unlike most albums,  not one song is bad. Love it when Tom goes Reggie with Don't Pull Me Over! MOJO is a great combination of slow and fast songs,  all which are catchy to the ear. I'm looking forward to listening to his next album, Hypnotic Eye.
0,I mean come on! "Hammer smashed face", for crying out loud!!! This song deserves the price you pay for the whole CD, the rest of the album is just an "incredibly excellent" bonus.	It is that simple: ....	BUY THIS CD NOW!!!
0,David's debut album is a standout for its energy, passion and David's vocal performance.  Thank God for Operacion Triunfo which helped catapult this artist to stardom!
0,Good Cd.
0,This is what I would expect from a first pressing. Great album overall from Tom Petty and a great quality pressing.
0,I like every cut on this album. I wish all artists had albums this well developed.  This is essentially a greatest hits album, only better.
0,Do yourself a favor and buy this.  Trust me, you won't regret it.  Songs are great, even the filler tracks are o.k., packaging is a-mazing, production is excellent.  Tool has done it again!
0,very cool!
0,...to one of the best bands of all time.		I do suggest buying any Specials record / CD because they ARE that good. But this is certainly the one youll want to keep on hand. The Singles Collection was the first batch of Specials songs I ever owned. And it is great for a new Specials fan or a long time fan. This CD contains the basics and while the basics may not be enough for the snobby, know-it-all fans, it is still well worth buying. Its fun, real and some of the best Ska this planet has ever heard. Its a CD youll keep close. I promise. 5 big stars!	Matter of fact- I think Ill buy another copy of this myself.
0,This is a great punk rock album.  I played it a lot last year.  Aron Elliott of Riverview Church Bookstore in Perth (Australia) sold me the cassette of this in 2002 for A$1, so will give him a plug and thank him for it.  This album is not much like MXPX later stuff.  Its very rough, very raw, very fast musically, no sugary guitars and not much melodies.  Sounds a bit like The Clash's debut album.  Production on this album's not great.		My favorite songs are the first six starting with Anywhere But Here.  Lyrically, they are all interconnected in topic, and Mike seems to get angrier as each song passes.  Want Ad (like Bad Hair Day toward the end of Side One) is softer and typical MXPX humor, but it sounds more like a short commercial break in the middle of the fast angry songs.  Lyrically songs like Weak, Realize and Think Twice are about standing up to so-called friends who take advantage of people and refusing to be manipulated by such people.  The lyrics sound angry and they are very heartfelt, and deal with a topic all of us can relate to.		Apart from the first six songs, theres a bit of repetition in the album.  My other favorites are High Standards and Time Brings Change on Side Two and PXPX and Ears To Hear on Side One.  High Standards has a good line that states "Give your life to God, come into his light".  Im Christian so I appreciate hearing these type of lines as part of a punk song.  Overall, top album that has been very enjoyable to me and learnt a lot from it and been inspired and challenged by the lyrics countless times.  But not for you if you only like pop punk.
0,This album is just another testament as to how good Hernan really is. The Masters Series 1 was a great album. Althought it might not be text book Hernan, disk one had some great tracks. I was a little disappointed with some of the tracks on disk 2(specifically the Josh Wink track that I've never liked), but I felt it was a great mix once you got past that.		This album is even better. The mellow and deep mood of disk 1 is great to just chill out and relax listening to. From beginning to end it's nothing but sexy soulfull house music that gets your foot tapping at some points, but never really makes you want to get up and dance. It's almost comparible at times to the feel of a Dave Seaman mix. The music is great, and the mixing is always phenominal, but the tracks don't really wow you. It's mainly progressive, but there are points where it sounds more like deep house.		Disk two has more of the feel of an actual live show of his. The music is amazing. It's more upbeat, and really makes you wish you were at a club watching him perform live. It's the perfect disk if you're in the mood for some upbeat house. It's a progressive mix to the full extent, and keeps up a nice tempo throughout the entire mix. The tracks he uses are amazing. Disk 2 is definately the knock out punch of the combo.

0,Love this album from Bethel Music
0,Miles used to think this about Jimmy Smith, and he was right. Jimmy really was a marvel of the jazz world! He was an incredible bopper but he also invented the organ jazz thing. He has been incredibly influential. And rightly so because in a sense he invented a way of playing jazz, organ soul jazz. But this one is probably the best late album by Jimmy Smith (and it is straight ahead jazz, bebop I might say). He played exceptional music 'til his last days, nevertheless this album is one of the best of his late years (1995 .... you can buy Off the top too, the album he recorded with Benson, Turrentine, Carter, Tate in his late years, the eighties maybe, it's fabolous!!!!). He is accompanied here by a cast of great, really great "new" cats (Nicholas Payton, Roy Hardgrove, Mark Whitfield and more.. ) but don't forget, Jimmy is still the star. Even if it's not an historic recording from Smith (50's, 60's) it is of that quality. You can believe me. Jazz of the highest quality with an old LION still growling as he used to! It is an album of standards and Jazz originals. Among the best tune I point out the blues opener, "Papa's got a brand new bag" from James Brown songbook, played here as a thunderous Jazz anthem. I remember to have read that in the sixties when James Brown (which would like to play the organ and he played in a childish way in his concerts) heard Jimmy Smith playing, he literally shot his Hammond Organ!! I can't think what he could do if he had the opportunity to listen to this Smith's version of his "Bag"!!! Hi hi hi hi !!! =))))) Then I would say "Scrapple from the apple" a line from Charlie Parker's pen. Finally I would say that this album is very very well recorded, audiophile quality I'd say. My Avalon speakers really appreciate this one! BUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY this one absolutly before it goes out of print. Believe me.
0,After listening to this CD, if you don't have it you should get it. This is a great CD. It reminds me of Kurt Carr and the Kurt Carr Singers. That's probably because Kurt Carr produced this album. I think it's as good as Isreal and New Breed's "New Season" album. "Magnify Him" starts out the experience. It's a rousing, nicely-done remake of the Michael Brooks tune penned for Witness 10 years ago. "My Soul Says Yes" ends the experience on a high note with hand clapping and foot stomping. In between is a wonderful praise and worship experience. "The Presence of the Lord is Here", "It Is To You", and "There Is A Name" are my favorites. He also has a medley that covers some of his old material: "Lord We Glorify You", "Shabach", and "Yet Praise Him". That's one of my favorites as well. This music will pierce the soul and lead you into the presence of the Lord. The music is top-notch. The vocals are out of this world. Every facet of the album was done in excellence. I'm not even a Byron Cage fan - never have been. I am now! This album is one that when you hear it, you can't ignore it. If you like Israel and New Breed, Judith Christie McAlister, Kurt Carr, etc, then you will love this collaboration of songs that are sure to touch your heart and usher your spirit into worship. Be Blessed
0,I do not like this one as well as Paul Baker's others, "Journey of the Spirit", "Peace Beyond Words", and "Reflections of Serenity" but it is still worth 5 stars.
0,Love her voice and the music makes you feel. If you haven't listened yet you are missing something beautiful.
0,Depeche Mode have been in the business for about 30 years.  They have been world reknown for their remixes, as much as for their bold and daring take in the music they present with each album.  It is nice to hear a refreshing twist to an old favorite, renewing the allure.  It is fascinating that Depeche Mode can recreate themselves time and again, giving us more Music for the Masses!
0,Lowell George and Roy Estrada started Little Feat as a direct result of being fired when Frank Zappa broke up the original Mothers. Say what you want about LF's later albums ("Feats Don't Fail Me Now" and "Dixie Chicken" are absolute must-haves, by the way) but the first two albums are truly something special with Estrada's intelligent bass playing and Lowell at his absolute creative pinnacle.	Has anybody written anything as wondrously whimsical as "Snakes on Everything?" As Drugged-up paranoid as "Strawberry Flats?" or as instant-classic as "Willing?" That's one of the cool parts of this LP--you get to hear "Willin'" in its original form, without the country-western motif--just Lowell singin' and strummin' while Ry Cooder plays slide.	Be warned, though--this is NOT standard three-chord, "I-know-where-this-is-going" type stuff. Fact is, you DON'T know where it's going and that's what makes it so good.	The band's tribute medley to Howlin' Wolf is absolutely great. Bill Payne's contributions to the album ain't bad, either. But Lowell George made his mark on the music world with this vinyl tattoo and I know it's one tattoo that I NEVER want removed.	Buy their second album, "Sailin' Shoes," too.
0,April 1955 was originally released on EmArcy records, and has finally been reissued on Verve! The remastered sound (although still mono) breathes new life to this recording, and makes all of the instruments crisper and clearer. (thanks to the mastering by Kevin Reaves at Universal Mastering Studios).		Maynard played with Charlie Barnet and joined Stan Kenton's band in 1952, playing tenor sax and arranging. Funny that he's now considered one of the greatest trumpeters of all time, and one of the first who could play in the stratosphere cleanly. This set feels like a jam session, with a tighter feel due to the fact that all but "Autumn Leaves" are composed and arranged by Bill Holman. All of the songs have a distinctive West-Coast Jazz feel, and even border on 'Cool' at some points. This is a great mid-50s jazz date with some of the best West Coast jazzers (some from Kenton's band) available.	If you're interested in hearing what Maynard sounded like before he became the commercial success of the 70s, this is where it's at. He really lets it rip on "Super-G."		Maynard (whose playing feels like it could be a little cleaner at times), plays Trumpet, Bass Trumpet, and Valve Trombone. He is joined by Conte Candoli (trumpet), Milt Bernhart (trombone), Herb Geller (alto sax), Georgie Auld (tenor sax), Bob Gordon (bari sax), Ian Bernhard (piano), Red Callender (bass) and Shelly Manne (drums.) The original liner notes are quite funny, because a number of the artists weren't named, as they were under contracts with different labels. Georgie Auld is listed as "Mendel Balitz," and the others are described with hints and clues to figure out who they are. The solos from all members are above-average, and at times superb!
0,A great album of pop inspired tunes from Ms. Mann.  Once again, she does not disapoint.  Only the last song seems oddly out of place.  Not to be missed!
0,It is just what I needed at this time. Works just fine.	It is easy to use and very enjoyable.
0,I heard the song and laughed so hard, I looked up the album. The first song is Ray Wylie Hubbard's "Drunken Poet's Dream." The last is a hilarious cover of "I don't want to grow up." I was sold and the tracks in the middle weren't just empty filler. "Trouble" just kept on delivering.		"Trouble in Mind" is a pretty good title for this bluesy sardonic collection of thoughtful and cynical humored country.  This is Texas singer Carll's first release on a major label, Lost Highway.		My only complaint with this CD is the sound quality which is worth half a star.  It's marginal in iTunes format and acceptable on my stereo. But, for the quality of the musicianship and the thought in the lyrics--I'll be looking up the rest of Carll's music very shortly.		Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
0,oh my God. this cd is a work of pure genius and is far better than their brilliant debut. the songs here are alot more melodic with more of a singing emphasis, but still has very heavy music backing the vocals up. fav songs are prison song,deer dance,chop suey,science,and toxicity. go pick this cd up now if you are a true metal fan. lets hope these guys stick around for a long time to come.
0,Badfinger was a band that could have been one of the world s'biggest and popular, but that was not their destiny. They had some hit singles but their biggest hit, "Without You" was not their s',; that song was a number one hit for: Maria Carey, Harry Nillson and Air Supply among others (Heart and many others, had also a hit with the song).		Several important songs are missing here: Perfection and Suitcase from "Straigh Up" and "We re from the Dark" from "No Dice". Also "Miss You" from Badfinger and some others.
0,It really annoys me when people keep citing the fact that Ronnie Wood played with them as if that alone is the reason for paying The Birds any attention.  The truth is, in terms of aural sex and violence, non of the UK bands from the mid-'60s could compete, not even the mighty Who.		This disk represents an opportunity to savour one of the top Freakbeat outfits of the day and marvel how in hell they languished in obscurity for as long as they did (probably still do).  Well, the majority's loss is our gain since the average clod would probably be way too uncultured to appreciate the 3-chord snarl and splendour of our favourite London lads.  Musically, they had their roots in American soul music, R 'n' B, Bo Diddley etc like pretty much everyone in Britain back then but rather than follow the formula slavishly, they cranked up the hostility and aggression way up to ten to produce something suitably unrecognizable from the original.  Cream of the crop is "Daddy Daddy" a bizzare tale involving a group of children being left somewhere surrounded by horrible people which ends up dissolving into fuzztone freeform madness towards the end.  And lo and behold!  The alternate version called "Daddy Daddy Daddy" is even more deranged!		Sonically, the disc is impressive.  I have much of the material on vinyl (a compilation called "The Birds" recently came out on vinyl and I'd advise everyone to get hold of a copy) and while it's true that the CD does not capture lower-end frequencies and bass as well as the LP, it's still a searing effort.  You can really feel the hate and blinding intensity in those guitars.  Full marks for the digital mastering and for a change, it's one CD that I can honestly recommend to anyone who's turntable-less		The '64 - '66 era was Britain's finest hour, at least musically.  And The Birds were part of the whole thing nesting comfortably against other tough white R 'n' B outfits like the Pretty Things, The Small Faces and The Who.  These recordings will appeal to all those who pine for the days when Rock 'n' Roll was crude and "dumb", before psychadelia reared it's ugly snout and put dangerous ideas about "good musicianship" into the fragile minds of all those impressionable Mod hoodlums
0,Syleena Johnson the most underrated artist in the music business. She has an amazing voice. She is a hell of a lot better than the other crap of Jive records. Examples : Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, R. Kelly, Nick Lachey. If Jive promoted her music better, she could be as big as they are. Anyways, Chapter 3 : the Flesh is another great album from Syleena and Jive Records needs to give her music better treatment.	My top 5 songs from the album are :	1. "Phone sex" Ft. Twista	2. "Another Relationship"	3. "Classic love song" Ft. Jermaine Dupri	4. "he makes me say"	5. "only a woman"
0,reason for title
0,I am listening to it now - great music.
0,To be fair, Jamiroquai got too many songs that can be put into a "greatest hits" type of release. However this stuff really worth your money since it contain at least 19 tracks! All their biggest hits are here, cosmic girl, virtual insanity, space cowboy, deeper underground and their later hits seven days of sunny june.
0,I purchased this cd in 1993. I would say that this release is one of the most underrated works of the early 1990's. The songs are beautiful and thought provoking. The beginning of the song "Ayer" was on my voice mail for years! If you can't buy this new, buy it used, it's worth it!!
0,geeeah eiht is back, geeeeeah, tha8t'z gangsta geeeeah, geeeeah,this is the joint to bump right here, why u hot damn, my other 2 favorites are like this like that, and can i? eiht delivers as usual, always making those beats you creep in the late night with. he has a new label, i hope eiht and the cmw crew keep making that street stuff much sucess to half ounce records.
0,Ever since these Canadian boys invaded the US in the early 80's Loverboy has been a favorite of mine, and being in radio has given me a HUGE opportunity to follow these guys quite regularly. I've only seem them perform twice, and the last time I could tell that Mike Reno has lost a tiny bit of his ability to hit some of the higher notes...but he STILL sounded pretty good.  'Big Ones' is probably one of the better examples of what 80's rock & roll was all about.  Who could forget 'Workin' For The Weekend' (a blue-collar anthem to this day) and 'The Kid Is Hot Tonight' and gosh, all the rest--fantastic bubble-gum harder than average pop-rock music.	Loverboy, more than most pop bands of the 80's knew how to produce an immediately likeable guitar-riff (much like Def Leppard was able to do--only maybe not as good) and always kept the energy flowing high.  They were no strangers to ballads, either, and they were ALL top-notch as well.  But what I think could make or break a band in the 80's was the ability to tour and promote albums, and THAT is where Loverboy excelled, again more than most pop bands.  These guys seemed to be in the big arenas every few months!  I have NO idea where they managed to write new songs--let alone get into a studio to record them, but that is exactly what they did, and through the late 80's you could COUNT on a new Loverboy release coming out every few months like clockwork.  And they were good, too--really good on stage, which doesn't hurt.  These guys may not be looked at as a serious rock & roll band, but I don't care--I LIKE Loverboy, and probably always will.  Great CD.
0,I have never heard another album this relentless...  Listen and you will be defeated too.  You will be angry that you ever let yourself be subjected to this kind of abuse and then you will listen again, and again, and  again...
0,Absolutely love this album!
0,A great collection of country music by the Nashville outlaw, Johnny Paycheck.  If you're considering buying some of Paycheck's music, this is the place to start.  All of the tracks on this album have great sound; no defects that I could hear.  The audio quality is every bit as good as those very expensive Bear Family sets.		In the Marketplace, you can get this for less than eight dollars plus four dollars shipping.  That's a bargain that's hard to pass up for 26 tracks of great music.
0,Great album, highly recommended!  If your a Parsons fan its a cant miss experience!
0,In 1967, Jack Greene won four CMA awards(Best Male Vocalist, Best Album, Best Single and Song Of The Year for "There Goes My Everything")and went on to become a well known and popular Grand Ole Opry member. He charted nine Top Ten singles between 1966 and 1970 and recorded duets with Jeannie Seely. His warm, emotional vocal style and keen choice of appropriate material were a perfect combination on a prolific number of recordings for the Decca/MCA label. Unfortunately, this British Edsel CD compilation is the only available collection of those original recordings.	Arranged chronologically, the twenty tracks include his first hit, "Ever Since My Baby Went Away", as the set opener. It is followed by his #1's: "There Goes My Everything", "All The Time", and "You Are My Treasure". Other biggies include "What Locks The Door"(#2), "Wish I Didn't Have To Miss You(#2 w/Jeannie Seely), and "Back In The Arms Of Love"(#4).	The lesser chart hits are no less enjoyable and standouts include: "There's a Whole Lot About A Woman(That A Man Don't Know)", "Makin' Up His Mind", "I Need Somebody Bad", and "He Little Thing'd Her Out Of My Arms". (Noticably missing are three other hits: "Until My Dreams Come True"(#1), "The Last Letter", and "Lord Is That Me".)	The highlight of this anthology is the powerful "Statue Of A Fool"(#1). That classic, along with "There Goes My Everything", gives Jack Greene a timeless pair of signature songs.	The liner notes and pictures in the CD booklet are informative and well done.

0,Strangely, this is the first review I've done of an Opeth record even though I own 5. Part of it, like all Opeth releases, is that it takes a bit of time for the album to sink in and thanks to the ever-shifting changes in tempo, dynamics and song lengths, sometimes it takes awhile before you really "get" an Opeth release. Released after their 6th release, "Deliverance" which was one of their heaviest records, in comes "Damnation" which is one of their more softer, introspective and dare I say it, gorgeous releases. While some songs are just simply good, others are their best of their whole career.		Windowpane: With its eerie guitar chord intro, the album opens and leads into a gorgeous track complete with 2 great guitar solos and an effective bridge at 2:24 with guitars playing the same riff but out-of-sync. Longest track and a great opener. 9.5/10		In My Time of Need: Very chime-y guitar arpeggios start off though strangely I'm not a fan of the halted verse melody though of course that changes with the pre-chorus which leads into the chorus that really shows off Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals. Outro goes on a bit too long but oh well. 9/10		Death Whispered a Lullaby: Upbeat title no? Anyway, the opening acoustic riff is catchy and the chorus is another Akerfeldt standout but the song as a whole I never could get into all that much. I like the Pink Floyd-esque guitar solo though. 7.5/10		Closure: Emotive vocals and 12-string acoustics start us off before we get a repeating riff and few instances of distortion, and ending with a riff sounding like from the Middle East and more ethnic drumming until it unexpectedly cuts off. It's decent and I like parts of it, just not the whole. 6/10		Hope Leaves: A quite gorgeous song with everything from the chime-y arpeggios like track 2, Akerfeldt's vocals (I love the pre chorus), backing vocals from male to an ethereal female, this is easily one of the best songs on the album. 9.5/10		To Rid the Disease: A beautiful-yet-eerie guitar riff starts off the track and the chorus is pretty enough though it's not really stunning either. But adding the piano to mimic the guitar riff is a nice touch and the piano riff after the solo is absolutely gorgeous and very simple. It's one of those I like the song but love its parts. Weird, I know. 8/10		Ending Credits: Strangely, the title doesn't mean it's the last track of the album. It's an instrumental with an acoustic guitar providing simple chord progressions before the 2nd guitar basically solo's riffs throughout the whole thing. It's a fun song to play and it's peaceful though not really a put-on-repeat one. 8/10		Weakness: Strange organ sounds sounding sci-fi-esque and very minimal guitar playing makes this a very lowkey album closer though for a record like this, it seems oddly appropriate. Nice bit of winding down and nice to listen to though it probably won't go on your iPod...unless you got chill-out music on there. 8/10		It would be easy to recommend buying Damnation if you're not an Opeth fan already since it's so different than the others; on the other hand, it's for that reason why it's maybe not the best "starter" release since the others will surprise you. But still, it would be a shame if you didn't check out this release anyway.
0,I love this album because it sounds the most "sixties" out of the Badfinger albums. (and it still sounds great!) If my history is correct, this album is a combination of old stuff they recorded as a different band and then they work they did for the Magic Christian movie with the help of Macca.		If you purchase this album looking for that famous 70's inspired Badfinger sound, you'll be disappointed. IF you buy it like i did for "Come and Get it" you'll love it and all of the other great music held within.
0,On time without a hitch
0,Forget Nightwish, Tarja's back with a vengeance!		Given the extremely disappointing CD Nightwish gave us with their new singer I wasn't expecting much from Tarja, heck I didn't know she was even working on anything. However, even though I adored her work with Nightwish, I always thought Nightwish was a huge reason those CDs were so good. One listen to My Winter Storm and you'll quickly find out that that wasn't the case at all. The first three songs alone put Nightwish's newest offering to shame on all fronts.		What I love about My Winter Storm is the fact that it has these gorgeous, sweeping interludes that play perfectly into each and every song. Thus making this one of those CDs you can listen to completely, without hesitation. Where Nightwish CDs were sometimes exhausting to listen to completely, Tarja's solo effort doesn't fall victim to that...which is definitely a good thing.		Did you love Tarja before? You'll love her even more now. Some of the music that accompanies her on here is nothing short of breathtaking. Take the symphonic heaviness of Lost Northern Star for example. Or even the calm, toy-esque beginning of My Little Phoenix. It just doesn't stop! Then you also have the classic moments you know you're gonna be left wanting to hear over and over again, such as the climax of Boy And The Ghost most notably. I'm hardpressed to think of a single hole in this CD, all the bases are covered magnificently.		My favorite songs are I Walk Alone, Lost Northern Star, Boy And The Ghost, Our Great Divide, and Ciaran's Well. Not enough good things can be said about this release. Most anything good you hear about My Winter Storm will have merit behind it, it's just that good. Listen and enjoy!
0,Speedy delivery.album was as promised shape. Thanks again.
0,Lord knows what prompted them to cut this, but in the 1986 Post Punk/Alternative/Underground scene, a covers record was unheard of. Furthermore, to feature songs made famous by the likes of Johnny Cash, Gene Pitney &Tom Jones was perversely unfashionable to say the least.		Looked at this way, Kicking Against the Pricks is a big middle finger to fans & especially critics alike. But it was also a genuine ode to the music Cave & The Bad Seeds sincerely loved, which is precisely how they pull this stunt off.		 In terms of ballads like "By The Time I Get To Phoenix" & the pure Pop embrace of "Something's Got A Hold Of My Heart", a startling side to Cave is revealed for the 1st time: Nick The Crooner. He genuinely gives his all to "Sleeping Annaleah", while the Bad Seeds provide suitably demented backing.		More than any other recording artist, Johnny Cash has the honor of being paid tribute to the most. This album boasts not 1 but 3 songs cut by the Man In Black. But you have to remember that Cash's resurgence of popularity was more a few years away. At the time, he was far from hip.		The brooding opener, "Muddy Water" is from Cash's 1979 Silver album, an obscure choice that fortunately did not escape Cave's notice. The same goes for Cave's menacing interpretation of the Cash rarity, "The Folksinger". As for "Long Black Veil", while the version here can't hope to compete with The Man In Black's, in terms of mood & atmosphere, it's certainly commendable.  If some journalist wanted to coin a genre for these 3 I'd suggest, "Gothic Country".		The Bad Seeds' previous, First Born Is Dead was steeped in John Lee Hooker's influence & Cave launches into "I'm Gonna Kill That Woman" with merciless abandon. Amid the plethora of Hooker covers out there, I'll go so far as to say this is up there along with Them's "Baby Please Don't Go" as being definitive.		 Another standout is The Hammer Song which I feel surpasses Alex Harvey's original.		As for the full on Gospel of "Woman At The Well", this was something that just was not done at the time. Then the curtains draw to a close with a gorgeous, haunting rendition of The Seekers' classic, "The Carnival Is Over".		As with all the re-issues in this series the sound is amazing. You can hear every pin drop. In terms of the bonus tracks, Cave's ferocious near a cappella take on Leadbelly's "Black Betty" is essential.		To say this is the Bad Seeds at their least ground breaking would be missing the point. All that's absent is any hint of cynicism or mockery. In many ways this is Cave's most innocent & nostalgic offering since he 1st "released the bats". He would later cut many a fine love song, but at this point in his career anything resembling a traditional ballad was a rare commodity.		Despite all the musical inanities that prevailed in the 80's, what's so remarkable is how this & all of Cave's records hold up so well some 23 years later. They simply don't sound dated. And Kicking is if anything, as much out of step as it is out of time. This is Ham Radio Oldies AM 101...Bad Seed Style.
0,..I WANNA TAKE YOU HIGHER! Man, back in the day Sly was the bomb! If I remember correctly Sly was the first concert I ever saw, back in 197x at Madison Square Garden. I used to wear this album out. You can't go wrong with this CD in your collection and I dare say it's a must-have. Great songs with catchy arrangements, especially the horns. And downright funky! Check out the 13 minute track 'Sex Machine' and tell me that isn't badass! C'mon now, you gotta have some Sly Stone in your collection.	BOOM LAKA LAKA LAKA	BOOM LAKA LAKA LAKA	[...]
0,In terms of size and overall sound, Mccreesh's 'Creation' has a strong resemblance to Christopher Hogwood's 80's recording, (which by now I have listened to so many times I felt the need for an alternative). The main difference, besides the absence of Emma Kirkby, is that Mccreesh's pacing is more expansive, and that leaves room for a more dramatic interpretation all around. The sound, not really surprisingly, is also improved. The soloists are excellent, too. I have a feeling I'm going to listen to this recording too many times!
0,I listen to a lots of Blues Music. Traditional, Chicago, Acoustic, Rock Blues and truly enjoy the genre. This is my favorite blues release in the past year. This is a high qulaity representaion of Jimmy Reed's material.	Omar lends his deep beliveable vocal style, Jimmy V. gets in a great groove, Delbert's Harp is very true as are his vocals and Lou Ann Barton lends very nice backing vocals. This has a Texas Blues influence that mixes well with the Mississppi heritage. I highly suggest this music.
0,A fairly decent Swedish 2CD collection covering Aggie's entire career-Swedish, English, ABBA, kids albums, and non album tracks. A 3Cd version of this collection was also made available (but not in stores).The 2CD set has 25 songs from the pre- 1980 Swedish career,but the 80's English stuff is not covered, as well, since space is spent by including some ABBA songs.		Some non- Aggie album tracks are featured including the singles "Never Again,',The Way You Are, and" Its So Nice To Be Rich" . The B-side" P&B" can not be found on either this album or the later THAT'S ME collection.		This collection was compiled by Aggie and Michael Tretow. . Every Agnetha fan should have at least this album or TIO AR MED. Aggie's	Swedish work is her best solo work.
0,The Soft Boys were one of the best live post-punk acts I ever saw - heavy, eclectic, playful, with a singer like Rasputin the mad monk who ranted some awesomely perverse and intricate lyrics. However, they never escaped the underground. They had two problems: first, they never translated onto record. This, their best, is a great document, but generally sounds too polite, and has a way too clean, over-trebly production. An all-time Top 100 record in my book, this is the one most needing a decent remaster. Second, their material was quite difficult to get a handle on. Unlike other bands of the time, who attempted complete rejection of existing musical forms, Soft Boys foreshadowed the modern rock-history-as-resource attitude, borrowing harmony vocals, garage-psychedelic stylings and Beefheart skronk to form a kind of complex, psychologically disturbed post-rock which was nothing like the de rigeur dubby, chickenscratch minimalism of a Banshees or PiL. Also, they were much less obviously finger-givers than people like the Gang of Four or The Pop Group, and the anti- attitude tended to be where it was at. All this made it difficult for angry young men of the time to get a handle on the group.	Despite these issues leading to the instant obscurity of the band, `Underwater Moonlight' is ageing very well and the content is so good it deserves top rating. Basically a pop record, it covers a lot of styles and much trad pop content (as well as some mad surrealist stuff never seen before), including the time-honoured boy-girl theme, which, it has to be said, gets a radical seeing-to: `Insanely Jealous' is by some distance the best-ever song about obsession after being dumped, with murderously manic lead which blows your head off despite the production. `I Wanna Destroy You' hates everyone, but is dressed in seductive harmonies. It's also very funny. `Kingdom of Love' is a standout, a song whose chosen metaphor for sexual obsession is chin-infesting lice with heads that look like that of the object of desire. Yes, that's right. `Old Pervert' is a great track about feeling unattractive, over-sexed, and past it, buying into the neuroses that afflicted intellectual long-maccers at the time (well, me anyway). My personal favourite, though, is `You'll Have To Go Sideways', an instrumental which gets the Soft Boys' intransigent onstage lock-down absolutely right, with the group climbing one of their signature interlocking staircase structures. Insane arpeggios are backed by psychedelic swathes of glare-delay; this is manic psychedelia for mathematicians. Everything else is good-to-great as well.	All in all 'Underwater Moonlight' is a beautiful reminder of the creativity, intelligence and honesty which music briefly went through in the post-punk years, just before everyone went entryist and eighties synth-pop was inflicted upon us. It deserves to be much better known.
0,This is truly a great CD.  I was not a big Lonestar fan until I recently heard their new release ,"My Front Porch Looking In".  They are what I believe is true talent.  Their rendition of ,"Walking in Memphis", is better than the original!  Dean Sams defines what a talented and excellent pianist truly is.  I plan to update my CD collection with the earlier Lonestar CD's but this new CD is one that everyone will definately enjoy.  No negative remarks on this one.  Only the finest!  Thanks for great music and keep up the great work!
0,Carolina Liar opened for Rob Thomas, they were very good.  The best warm up band I saw in years.  With their CD out, and their music on the radio, probably not a warm up band any more, go see them.
0,I miss him so much. Great album for Grover fans!
0,I remember when this album first came out in 1988, a former manager at a summer job of mine recommended it to me.  However, I was immersed in thrash metal at the time and didn't take notice of it until 20 years later.  A couple years ago I decided to pick-up a used copy of the original issue on Amazon for less than $1.  I've given it several listens and I must say that I was quite surprised at the overall quality and creativity of this album.  I will not go as far as other reviewers that say this is on par with 'The Wall' (it's not, in my opinion), but I will say that as a progressive rock/metal concept album, it's quite good.  Better late than never, but I should have listened to my boss 2 decades ago!		It far exceeds the other Queensryche albums that I also purchased for about $1 on Amazon ('Rage for Order' and 'Empire').  These other albums are good, but are not on par with 'Operation Mindcrime'.  Unlike 'Rage for Order' and 'Empire', which have a few standout songs interspersed with a bunch of mediocre and similar-sounding filler material, 'Operation Mindcrime' contains enough variety, sampling, and progressive experimentation to warrant listening to the whole thing, end to end, without getting bored.		Also, laying out the concept and picking 'Eyes of a Stranger' to close out the album was a great decision.  It's arguably the strongest song on the album, if not in the entire Queensryche catalog.  Excellent way to close out a unique album.
0,Excellent.  Highly recommended
0,Perry has a beautiful voice love all his songs.	I'm going to play it tonight before I go to bed,
0,This was the best CD made in 100 years you will never find a CD like this again they don't make music like this anymore
0,Classic Dubstep
0,Very entertaining and educational, good music too.
0,Great deal
0,Excellent!
0,My father turned me on to Bert Kaempfert when I was growing up.  He died at 47 years old, when I was 15, miss him a lot.
0,Excellent, not typically my style of music, but this is really good. Has it's dark moments, but it is real, and that makes it what it is.
0,Seriously.  Every song here has a pop hook (meant in the truest sense of the word) that transcends "hip hop".  Like "Crazy", "Paper Planes", or, oh yeah "Hey Ya" , these are songs that sound instantly familiar, but not because they've bitten something that's been done before, but rather because they have a timeless quality to them.  "Follow Us" has a chorus that you swear you've heard before.  "General Patton" and "Night Night" have beats so perfect that you wonder how no one has thought of them sooner.  "Be Still" makes you sad that songs that deserve to be the most popular in the nation will never even crack the Top 100, but still amps you up enough to find out who guest singer Janelle Monae is and what her album's all about.  Then "You Ain't No DJ" brings just enough dissonance to ensure there's a little dirt under the nails of the album.  Amazingly, but not surprisingly, Big Boi's raps avoid corny gangsterisms or cliched mic-prowess boasting.  It's also a relief to know that Big Boi values his craft enough to use the endless delays that ensnared this record as an opportunity to continuously hone it into a stone classic.  Then consider that the version available in the store, with previously released instant classics like "Shutterbug", "Fo Yo Sorrows", and, of course, "Shine Blockas", doesn't even include two absolute monster bangers featuring Andre 3000 that were left off by Def Jam ("Royal Flush", also featuring Raekwon, and "Lookin' For Ya", about which, after it leaked, Big Boi famously stated "You know, I'm no stranger to that Internet, baby.")  For sure, Big Boi is on some Smiths-type stuff, even relegating a track  like "Theme Song", aka "Ringtone", that would be a lead single on most hip hop albums to mere Sir Lucious bonus track status.  Big Boi has dropped the album of the year so far, but it also cements his place in the pantheon, since he's probably the first rapper in history to be a part of four separate unimpeachable classics (Aquemini, Stankonia, Speakerboxxx, and Sir Lucious).  OutKast fans have seemed to traditionally root for Andre 3000, probably because he's the eccentric weirdo with a jones for Parliament-Funkadelic.  After Sir Lucious though, you wonder if all along Andre 3000 was merely Bootsy Collins and it was Big Boi who was George Clinton.
0,Always wanted this
0,"Ask Yourself" and "Best Friend" are good songs.  Not quite as good as the first but sounds better the more I listen to it.
0,After the massive success of "Permanent Waves" and "Moving Pictures", it would have been easy for Rush to rest on their laurels and turn out album after album in the same format.  But Rush has never been a band to stay stagnant, and 1982's "Signals" represents a departure and an evolution-- the aggressive, modern sound of "Moving Pictures" has been abandoned for a synth-driven rock sound.  Gone are any overt signs of their early sound-- the loud guitars, shouted vocals, all totally buried in the past.  Also missing are the long suites, or even any extended work-- indeed, no song stretches longer than six and a half minutes.  And finally, the lyrics, once drifting into fantasy and metaphor, have taken a much more direct tact.		The album has several sounds on it, the most common is a hazy, keyboard driven sound.  "Signals" opens with the throbbing, brilliant, "Subdivisions"-- no future imagery or mythical heroes rule this song, lyrically, its about pressure growing up, and its directness contributes to its success.  Similar in form and theme is "Losing It", a pretty song with some of the most passionate singing Geddy Lee has ever done and a great guest spot on electric violin by Ben Mink.		Rush hasn't quite abandoned more guitar oriented sounds yet-- "Digital Man", with its reggae rhythms and stunning bass by Geddy Lee and the brilliant, anthemic "New World Man" all all largely driven by Alex Lifeson riffs.  Somewhere in between is "The Analog Kid", with its great energetic verses and cloudy choruses (which also have some really stunning vocals from Lee) and "Chemistry", with its brilliant, circular chorus.		Less successful on the record is the drum-driven, rhythmic "The Weapon", which just doesn't seem to work-- its a bit plodding and definitely overlong, and the album closer-- "Countdown".  Really, it just doesn't do anything for me.		Nonetheless, the album is one of the best Rush ever did, and is highly recommended.

0,I truly think more people should own this DVD than will ever go to a Sheryl Crow concert.  As the population ages, such an easy form of entertainment ought to replace the more vigorous partying that young people engage in.  Millions of people know some of the songs on this DVD.  One of the big questions in American culture seems to be:  if a million people never heard of you, what good are you?  On a scale from nowhere to the top of the charts, crowds love those people who have been at the top of the chart, and concerts are an ideal situation for performers who want to get up in front of a crowd and bask in euphoria.  A DVD like "C'mon America 2003" shows how far a star like Sheryl Crow can go in music and spectacle.	It helps to know the music and words of some of the songs already.  When Sheryl Crow tells the crowd, "You guys are awesome!" after the second song, it must be because the presence of so many people who know exactly what is going on, word for word and note for note, is an inspiring experience.  I consider the words to be better than my usual reading, if music can be compared to philosophy.  Starting the concert with a guitar line from a relatively new song, "Steve McQueen," which challenges the crowd to remember when have they ever heard this before, while she rhymes "have some fun" with "how the West was won" in an ode to a fast machine with rock stars in the White House, pop stars who look like porn.  I think she is taunting the crowd with "underneath your radar screen, you'll never catch me tonight."	The second song, "There goes the neighborhood," starts with a line that tells the crowd where she is heading, "Let's party!"  This goes to extremes:  "This is the meltdown."  A typical joke in this song is about the police dusting her mother's plastic flowers.  They could be looking for fingerprints or collecting samples of some chemical dust, for all I know.  The ambiguity is obviously the main topic in the line that we "can't be certain who the villains are cause everyone's so pretty."  The music builds to a crashing ending.  Then I think the daylight video with empty chairs, a dog and baby for the song "Riverwide" was made during the sound check.  There are also a few soft songs during the concert.  "Redemption Day" seems a bit spooky, rhyming Heaven's gate with watch and wait and pontificate.  "Home" has a lovely blend of voices, finally putting a lot of slide guitar before the "I'm going crazy" verse, then using the piano to bring the music to a soft conclusion.	In between the soft songs, "If It Makes You Happy" and "A Change Would Do You Good" really rock.  After a lot of weird lines like "wear your fake fur on the inside," she finally gets to a message machine by the radar range that says, "Leave me alone."  The best dancing sequence is in the song "Everyday is a Winding Road."	After a little dressing room break, the song "You're an Original" shows some thought about how being unique does not last long.  Then she invites the crowd to quit their jobs and go on the road with her.  Watching this on a DVD, it seems a bit late to be so involved in a concert, but there are still a few more songs.  "Let's Get Free" suggests "digging within to find the truth" and "Truth is what you need."  The videos shown on a screen behind the stage don't usually detract from the concert, but the mushroom cloud doesn't show up until the end of "Safe and Sound."  If you miss it the first time, it might be because you were so interested in how much this DVD shows about how five musicians are able to make the music.  Once you know that you want to learn these songs, you are sure to watch this DVD again sometime.
0,This is one of my best discoveries this year.  This is catchy and melodic rock without being even slightly pop or produced.  Just a fantastic singer, great songs and a small band playing real instruments.  That's the hard way to make a record, but when it works it works.  I keep coming back to this one.  I always like it... I'm never amazed, but it's just a damn good album. I haven't given very many rock discs 5 stars but this is what its about.  Give it a try.
0,Mud Love Buddy Jam. That says it all. I love it, love it! I'm not a big fan of the way out extended jams and Space stuff, but disc two of this set is incredible! Mix this with tracks from 'Without A Net' and you can't go wrong.
0,This recording is going to stand as a tribute to its two leads.  It will likely memorialize Chita Rivera's last Broadway role, and who deserves a tribute to her artistry more than this beloved Broadway great and it will also be a lasting monument to the well loved Roger Rees who withdrew from the short Broadway run as his health declined.  To Roger and Chita, Chita a Roger, may this be a fitting tribute
0,As always, Dropkick Murphys rule!
0,This one is worth the money and really hits the mark.  I find myself going back to this one a lot in the same way as I play Armed Forces and This Year's Model.  You won't be disappointed with this one at all.  Buy it.
0,Good stuff but it's clear that it's a tale of 3 egos.
0,Didn't think I could like a CD as much as I liked their last one, but Dawes did it. Great stuff--good tunes, awesome lyrics, and for those who love music that has something to say, something to learn, this could very well be your new favorite band.
0,Great band What else can I say? This is a great purchase a one of a kind cd from a unique band, this is more than awesome.
0,Capone and his partner Noreaga (More commonly known as N.O.R.E) are back with the long awaited sequel to their classic, late 90's debut, 'The War Report'. First, I want to say that it's unfair to compare this to The War Report considering the time period we live in, and how music has evolved since then. The original title for this album was 'Reporting the War' and I think I preferred that better because it gave this album "spiritual successor" status instead of it being a direct sort of follow up (I.e the Stillmatic to Illmatic and not OB4CL to OB4CL Part 2) that breeds high expectations. But the title is the title, and I'm not going to dwell on that, let's get into it.		Production is better then I expected it to be, and that's meaning all around good. Producer contributions range from The Alchemist who is no stranger to producing artist from Queens [Mobb Deep, Cormega Nas] to Scram Jones who provided tracks for the OB4L2 sequel, Buckwild, and a host of others. The beats range from really mellow and mysterious like "Dutch Masters vs. Phillies vs. Bamboo" to hardcore, head nodding, Timberland boot, kick you in your face type songs like, "Thug Planet". I was hoping they would have gotten DJ Premier for a 3rd CNN collaboration [First being 'The Invincible' then 'Grand Royale'], but I guess it didn't work out.		Guest features are prominent, but aren't enough to make you feel like they're too much. Well, maybe one feature feels like dead weight... I know CNN are in a partnership with Raekwon, but I thought he had too many verses on the album. Putting him on 3 tracks is a little much. Especially considering how one dimensional Rae's style/content can be. Other guests include Faith Evans, who we haven't heard from in a while, Busta Rhymes, The LOX, Avery Storm and other longtime CNN contributors such as Nas, Iman Thug and Musaliny. The song that features Nas sounds kind of old though, I have a feeling that it may not be a new Nas verse, but the world has never heard it before, so I guess it's okay.		Lyrically both Capone and Nore have matured but it's sad to see how Noreaga doesn't rap in his signature style anymore. I thought he would have brought it back for this album, but no dice. He's still capable, lyrically, but it would have been nice to hear him rap that way again, if only for just one more album.		If I had to rank this in CNN's discography I would probably put it 3rd after 'The Reunion' album, but it's a VERY close 3rd mind you. The best album being the original War Report and their last effort, Channel 10 in 4th.		If you're like me and you loved the first War Report you should appreciate this, but again try to go into it not looking for a direct sequel (even though it is one). You may be disipointed if you want a revision of the 90's, so it's best to look at this as it's own entity or if you want, "The Stillmatic to CNN's Illmatic". Iumak gives this album a 8.5/10
0,I always have loved Steve's works w/Lou Reed, Alice Cooper & his IRS '80s solo releases, and this reissue is glistening.  The opener "Eight Miles High" is vintage Hunter aided by a rumbling rhythm workout w/Reed & Cooper bass vet Prakish John (coolest bass-cat ever!). Jim Gordon provides some startling drum fills as well.  Play it loud!  Things get experimental w/a variety of styles sampled, and "Sail On Sailor" soars w/some angelic siren vocals featuring future Rough Trade singer Carol Pope.  Excellent production & long overdue cd reissue.
0,I have followed Phil musically from the Montclair's "Dreaming's Out of Season" album, through "The Hang" DVD with other great artists, to this, his latest release.  Phil has moved to rearranging the "standards" of the sixties and seventies and adding his unique vocal touch.  To me, this CD reflects the maturity of excellent musicianship, solid lyrical songs, and vocal interpretation.  If you are looking for music that you can play during a gathering in your home, when you are "just chillin'", or are on the road in your car, then "Say Yes" is for you.
0,This is a FUN double-disc collection.  Power Ballads Gold has some awfully bad (in a good way) songs on it.  There were a few songs I had never heard before, but they definitely fit the hair-band mold.		Definitely cheesey.  Definitely worth the money.  This is much better than buying all of the individual band's CDs, which probably only have one or a few good songs on them.		Rock out with your air guitar!  Good songs for singing extremely loudly on the way home from work!
0,Danny Elfman's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" transcends a movie some people didn't like for its dark view of holidays--even if you disliked the movie, you may like the CD because the music is so devilishly clever and literate.  Elfman has managed to winningly combine the joy and purity of Christmas music with a darker look at this treasured holiday.  The lyrics are terrific (innocently sung but baldly truthful) and the music swoops, soars, and turns back on itself with astonishing ease and imagination. It's like an aural roller coaster in the best possible sense of that image.	Elfman sings the part of main character Jack Skellington (the "Pumpkin King," or master of Halloween) here, and he does a masterful job of conveying Skellington's yearning to do something different and important.  Skellington goes after the Christmas holiday with all his energy and ends up botching it badly.  Elfman manages to show us Skellington's earnestness as well as his dark side--this is no cardboard character, but a real (if not flesh-and-blood!) person, and we care about him.  Catherine O'Hara does a super job with her brief work here as Sally, the Frankensteinian rag doll who falls in love with Skellington.	This is a terrific paean to the holidays in general, and Christmas specifically.  With each listen, you'll find new things to admire and love about Elfman's nimble, imaginative music.
0,The mystery is why it has taken thirty five years to release the complete soundtrack?	This should have come out at the movies release in 1966. I tell you this it is worth every cent!
0,It is the very best work that the band has done. It takes me back to the mid 70s. I highly recomend it.
0,I really like her style of music....  Very gifted... I would like to see her play with other musicians.... Or maybe singers....
0,Phenomenal playing by Nina Gerber, who likes to accompany other great artists.  She is marvelously talented.
0,Great piece of music from this jazz master group...  As always, the newness permeates imagination...  One of my favorites...
0,Have you heard this band yet?? If you haven't, why not?	This is a kick-ass metal band out of Sweden.	This album/download sounds like Motley Crue, circa "Shout at the Devil," with a female lead vocalist.	And while you're at it, Google the vocalist, Liv Jagrell. Not only can she sing, she is hot too!	This band is the real deal. They have toured with bands like Motrhead, Otep, and Ill Nio.	This download and "13" by Black Sabbath are the best I've heard this year.	Check it out.
0,I've always liked Mandy Moore.  She's beautiful, talented and above all (especially in the midst of today's rehab-loving party girls in the vein of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton) smart.  Her latest musical endeavor Wild Hope might not always soar, but it's always admirable and interesting; although Mandy's past records might not be as bad as she makes them out to be when asked (I think every disc, excluding her generic debut, has shown growth for her), it's still intriguing to see the former teen pop star actually growing up musically instead of remaining in the dance pop genre her contempories have.  The album opens with the lead single "Extraordinary," a breezy summer treat that combines elements of folk and pop-rock; it might not have enough commercial appeal to be a Top 40 Britney Spears-like smash, but the track is no doubt catchy.  Mandy's singing has obviously improved over the years (as evident on Coverage, her amazing covers disc), and over the course of Hope you hear how it's matured even more; songs like the litling "All Good Things," rocking single-potential "Paradise," bitchy "Nothing That You Are" and touching "Gardenia" showcase the singer-songwriter's cute vocals.  And speaking of her songwriting skills, unlike, say, Kelly Clarkson's sometimes weird phrasings on her latest album, Moore's is poetic; on "Extraordinary," the words "I was a starling/Nobody's darling/Flying in circles just for company" paint a picture of one's own loneliness, and perfectly suits where she stands in today's business--she might not be up at, say, Britney's level of success, but she sure as heck is on her way.  It's not perfect, though.  On "Can't You Just Adore Her," despite the grooving chorus, Mandy's voice is nasally and country-tinged, which comes off completely atypical for her.  However, it's songs like the closing "Gardenia" that show what Moore's Wild Hope is really all about: beautiful melodies, beautiful singing and heartwrenching lyrics.
0,Yes they still rock and still keep getting better with age!!! Very cool and awesome songs!!!
0,Vinyl warning: The beginning of side A has a defect in the pressing. There is a skip or jump into the first song- the music starts with the horn already playing, not at the beginning of the song. Then, there are a series of pops in decreasing level. I have heard this on two copies: 166/1200 and 168/1200. Also, both records were warped, one slightly more than the other. This is disappointing because the rest of the release is superb: the jacket, the liner, the heavyweight clear vinyl, etc. Even the remainder of the record on both sides is noise-free and clean. Both of my copies were cleaned on a VPI machine and played back on a VPI turntable. Even with this defect, I give this release 4/5 stars because every other aspect is top-notch (especially the music) and I have nothing but good experiences with Demon Records. You have to decide if this vinyl release is worth $57 to you.
0,Highway 101 with Paulette Carlson was a unique sound and I love the cd. Wish they had been together longer.
0,Wasn't a big Ringo fan but I did enjoy this CD. I may check out some of his other CDs and DVDs
0,Truth is all you need is "Global a Go-Go" and "Streetcore" if you want to hear the matured, world-beat of the Mescaleros at the ir best. The earlier efforts are not as necessary to your collection.
0,Tabu Records continue to outdo themselves!
0,if you love the movie as i do, this is a great cd.  you feel like you're watchin the movie in each track, be they dialogue or music.
0,In a way, this CD follows the path of projects such as Cynic or Gordian Knot: Very technical, fast, sometimes jazzy, metal music.
0,Trerrific, as always!
0,IM SO SICK OF ALL THESE RETARDS SAYIN THIS AINT REAL PUNK RAWK CUZ IT IS!!! SIMPLE PLAN ARE ALL ABOUT BEING THEMSELVES AND REBELLING AGAINST SOCIETY AND ISNT THAT WHAT PUNK IS ABOUT ANYWAYS?

GET IT NOW BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST CD EVER AND SIMPLE PLAN IS THE BEST BAND EVER OH YA AND PIERRE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOO FINE *DROOL*!!!!!!
0,I bought this album last night and found myself listening to certain tracks and skipping over some. Thats what I do. Although I was concentrating on other things I did manage to get my thoughts together. It opens with a catchy beginning then decends into a more bluesy traffic material. This album was more clearer than Its about Time which was badly produced. Its a TRAFFIC album not the High Life keyboardy songs from the eighties. I love TRAFFIC....This will grow on you.
0,I like depeche mode, yaz, gary numan, 80's etc.  I have 3 of book of  love's CD and I'd say this one is the best.  If you are looking for more of  the 80's synth pop sound this is a very nice Cd to listen to.
0,A quality pressing in my opinion.  A fantastic album too.
0,Very nice CD from one of my favorite groups. The song selection and sound quality was very good, plus how can you go wrong with a group that got their name from one of the "Duke's" movies!
0,Great Christmas songs from a legendary singer!
0,The entire CD is fantastic and you can sing along.  AutoRip is my new best friend.  Immediate satisfaction of the purchase then the CD shows up the next day.  I leave this CD in the car and use the cloud player everywhere else.
0,This rocks!!,not as good as their s/t,or 5 easy pieces,but still	delivers a good punch. I would definately buy it still,really is	a keeper!.
0,Catchy hooks and melodies, incredibly depressing lyrics.  Can't listen to it as much as I'd like.
0,Love the cars
0,Amazing!!
0,I've followed Joey since the Badfinger days and he was always a powerful force in the band and most certainly as a solo artist. I bought and listened to a handful of these songs as fully realized demos a few years back. They were magnificent. The new studio versions lack the edge, so I'm hard pressed to be fair to those particular songs. The rest of the record is very solid Joey. His voice is in poor condition but he has such a wonderful voice that even a somewhat stripped out version is music to my ears. (Think George Harrison's Dark Horse vocals.) It's a good record when you gather all of Joey's stuff together and put this in the pantheon. It's a fair record if you don't. There are loads of awful records out there so this one is a definite must have if you have any love for power pop at all. This is calmer than that but it still has the guts and some good songs to pull it along. Joey will always right good songs. Return to Memphis is an apt title.
0,When I first heard a track from what I like to call The Greatest Rock Album Ever Made, I was in my car in North Hollywood, California.  I'd only recently moved to L.A., and I had this overwhelmed feeling about living here.  The sheer magnitude of the place made me feel like a tiny cog in an enormous machine.  It was in this state of mind, both excited and intimidated by the future, that I heard a song on KCRW called "Exit Music (For a Film)."		I didn't know who it was I was hearing, but that voice, so desperate and determined in the same breath, was weirdly compelling.  The voice got bolder, and with it the music grew louder, until it exploded into this fuzzy beast of a guitar, leaping and crawling like a spider and sending a crazy lattice of treble through my ears.  The experience was profound.  I couldn't leave my car.  I had to risk running late just to know, who was that?  Turns out it was ... Radiohead?  Really?		Those guys who did "Creep"?		Up until then, that's all I really knew about Radiohead.  I thought "Creep" was pretty good, but it reeked of one hit wonder.  I had nothing against them, I'd just never bothered with Radiohead before.  But now, based on just this song, I had to know what the rest of the album was like.  I picked up OK Computer later that day.		This would be the album that made me feel excited again about what music could do, like when I was a teenager and I got my first taste of Pink Floyd.  The first song was good; the second was amazing.  And then it got even better.  I could hardly believe that rock music could be this engaging yet entirely new, innovative but at the same time somehow inevitable.		The whole album is like that: vocals, guitar, bass and drums consistently hit the mark.  That would have been enough to make a memorable album, but there's something bigger going on here, something deeper.  You can hear it in the album's tone, its lyrics, even its title: It's not just an album.  It's a warning.		In every song, there's a resonant concern about where our fondness for technology is taking us, how it is changing us.  But while there is dread for what the future may hold, there is also hope, real hope.  That's what made OK Computer a completely indispensable CD for me.  It was like a sonic vindication of what I was feeling at the time, proof that I wasn't alone.		OK Computer is one of those very rare albums I have never tired of, no matter how many times I listen to it.  Like a Shakespeare play, a Kubrick movie, or any well-made work of art, it bears repeated viewings -- and reveals something new with every listening.  If you don't have OK Computer, pick it up.  And if you do, pop it in and hear it again.  In fact, put it on right now, while you're thinking about it.
0,I am thrilled with the SACD version of this classic. It's given me a chance to get to experience one of Dylan's greatest albums all over again. It's hard to express how fine the SACD sound is. Maybe the best way I can explain it is this: think about how much new detail you hear when you listen to a favorite album for the first time through headphones. The ambience, the pick on the guitar strings, the voice in breathy detail. SACD gives you that through regular speakers. Plus, the sound is definitely warm and atmospheric, no harsh highs like on the regular CDs. I can't wait to see the whole Dylan catalog released on SACD.
0,Ok, just two words will be necessary to describe this album!!!!	SCARY AND MIGHTY!!!!	Nothing has changed, as Schafer and Barlow are going on the right track... The album itself it's amazing...	All the music and lyrics are exactly as you can imagine for an enviroment... Dark and evil for "Damien"... Speed and sad for "Wolf" Rhytm and distress for "Phantom of the opera ghost"... anyway... you pick a song, close your eyes, and you are watching the monster...	It's cool to see speed songs (Wolf), epics (Phantom of the opera ghost), Ballads (Ghost of freedom), and lot of good songs (The rest)	My personal favorites... ALL!!!!!!	Get it... it will satisfy any HARDCORE METAL FAN...	Look at me... I can't stop listening it!!!
0,Always like Dwight Yoakam music and have all his CDs glad to add this to my collection thank you thanks
0,Good mix of slow and quick paced songs.
0,This is a very good collection of songs from the wonderful Jackie Deshannon. Some of her great radio songs and a few that I never knew she covered.
0,If u love mellow beck it's a must....just beautiful through out...Ito me beck took the helm of Neil young as far as changing up album to album....I don't like all his work...and that's ok....
0,Great
0,Excellent. Albert King a little older than on Live Wire Blues Power. Horn section that does what a rhythm guitar would do. A little funky. Thick bass and quality drums. A little older voice. A little more in the guitar licks. Very cool funky Don't Burn Down the Bridge, absolutely smoking slow burn As the Years Go Passing By.		This album displays Albert King with blues power + 5 years age + 5 years experience + a horn section. Highly recommended.
0,Beautiful - first song is long and monotonous - other than that, it is really quite lovely.
0,Aria was the second release Asia recorded with John Payne at the helm. The first, Aqua, was (IMHO) a bit disjointed, although it does have some good material on it.	Aria is a more coherent package, possibly in part because it's the ONLY Payne era release to enjoy the same musicians right through the recording!	We all know how good Geoff Downes is on the keys, and he doesn't disappoint (love the fancy bit to finish Desire). The vocals are full, much fuller than John Wetton can manage, and boast a hefty dose of diaphragm (something JW rarely employs).	The drums are also well played, probably my favourite example of Michael Sturgis' drumming (not so keen on his performance on subsequent recordings Arena and Aura, a bit too tame, although the albums themselves aren't bad at all and he's not the only drummer).	And Al Pitrelli is (IMHO) a world class rock guitarist, who was wasted on Aqua, and is given more of an opportunity to shine on this album. He gets several solo's, all of which are stunningly well played, not always especially complex but always interesting. Some might say they're are simply examples of rock cliches, and I suppose I can hear why - but he plays them SO well that who cares!!! The lead breaks on Desire, Summer and especially Don't Cut The Wire are superb. Just wish he'd turn the octaver off. And they fade him out a bit too soon on occasion (Don't Cut The Wire and Remembrance Day spring to mind).	The songs themselves are blessed with good solid and generally memorable choruses, and there are enough "proggy" bits to keep fans of that genre interested. The bonus track is a good 'un too. And the outro to Don't Cut The Wire is genius. Feel Like Love is a bit too close to Magnum (UK prog band) for me, but it's still a good song. Overall a very enjoyable slab of rock..	One of the best Asia albums, along with Asia, Alpha and Arena (maybe Aura).
0,The sound is superb. The people who remastered The Beatles catalogue should listen to this then hang their heads in shame.
0,Now that we have had a chance to live with it for  a while, we would include Gray's previous  album, 'White Ladder' among the very best of the last few years. Although he had made albums prior, they apparently lacked  that 'certain something' (not to mention Dave  Matthew's support) to garner widespread  appeal. With 'Ladder', Gray seemed to be the  first male to bring a kind of 70s  singer/songwriter sensibility (think James  Taylor, Jackson Browne) into the twentyfirst  century, using the electronic beats and sounds  of the modern studio. Now, after a dozen or so  listenings to his current cd, we still prefer the  previous one. But, in truth, that may be just  because it came first. The fact of the matter is  that this cd really feels just like an extension of  the last. A dozen more terrific songs. The same  warm, listener-friendly production. And, the  kicker, the unique and amazing voice of David  Gray, perhaps the most soulful white male singer  since his countryman, Van Morrison.
0,Gosh, it seems like I've been listening to this for a month!  New Order returneth however and what a great return.  This album sounds more NO than Get Ready and could easily replace the not so good Republic as a great follow up to Technique.  They're back!  Pounding bass, driving guitars and riveting techno showcase the best at their finest.  I Told You So has to be right up there with True Faith and Touched by the Hand of God as one of their best songs ever.(It will make you want to play Air Techno--Is there such a thing?)		The World is a better place with a new NO album.		And the lyrics! well, no I won't go there.  I love this band.
0,Gloria Estefan (and Miami Sound Machine) achieved so many charting hits on many different genre charts including pop,dance,adult contemporary and latin that a 2 CD collection of her successes has been lkong overdue.		I'm glad that Sony BMG has finally taken Gloria into consideration on their "Essential" series and more so that they saw she needed 2 Cds as opposed to a single disc collection. Every possible charting single is included, with the rare exceptions of "Nayib's Song" and "Along Came You", which were both included to commemorate her children (Gloria wrote both songs for her son and daughter Emily). And as a bonus, they included Mylo's European mash-up smash "Doctor Beat".		What also makes this collection unique is that they included BOTH English and Spanish hits. I am soooo glad sony decided to do this as every CD released before this liked to segregate her languages. This CD really represents her music and doesn't limit itself to genres. Some might think mixing her traditional Cuban sones with her AC pop songs create odd results for the listener but if you like GLoria, you'll appreciate the variety.		One more shout out...THEY FINALLY recognized her forgotten Top 10 smash "Falling In Love (Uh Oh)". This has always been one of my favourites and its cool that it was finally recognized as a hit!		This album deserves 5 stars all the way..even if its missing "Can't Forget You" and her #1 Latin hit "Por Un Beso". If you love Gloria it will please you and will want this CD to have all the "single versions" of her songs. And if you don't know GLoria, this will certainly educate you and leave you wanting more of this amazing woman.
0,I was blown away by this album.  Naked Without You features some of the best ballads that were never played on the radio.  Soon As My Heart Breaks and There Is No Heart That Won't Heal and Naked Without You are my personal favorites.  Of course, this album features two dance anthems - Whatever You Want (Remix) and Stand.  I love the powerful background vocals on both of these tracks.
0,Almost as good as his exceptional "Hotel Costes Quatro", Stephane Pompougnac's "Hotel Costes Etage 3" is what that perfectly cool Parisian bar you've been waiting to find will be playing in the background. Brilliantly sequenced, it drifts effortlessly between smooth "chill out" and high quality "electro-jazz" delivering, on the way, some real gems such as Funky Lowlives' "Latazz", Hacienda's "Late Lounge Lover", Cujo/Superstars of Rock's "Apollo", Stephane Pompougnac's own "PNC aux Portes" and The Troublemakers' stunningly funky "Electrorloge". Play it back to back with "Quatro" and luxuriate in two and half hours of quite unforgettable music... and then, as you will, play it all again.
0,Everything went well
0,She is one of the wonders of the world.  I won't bother listing her past accomplishments, because she has become the most famous woman in the world, so you already know them.  Her albums always deliver.  Her last two are as good as her first two, or better, depending on your point of view.  I can't think of any other long-term female artist about whom you could make this statement.		This is a fun, upbeat album, like "Confessions on a Dance Floor".  But not a clone.  It has a very different sound, probably because Madonna always knows how to make her records state-of-the-art.  She worked with some very talented, high-profile collaborators, and the end result is that, just like 95% of the time in the past, she sounds awesome.  "Candy Shop" and "4 Minutes" have utterly fantastic beats for her to ride.  "Candy" is "sticky and sweet", and it features those vintage high-pitched Madonna vocals, just as "Heartbeat" and other tracks do.  As for the participation of Timberlake and Timbaland on "4 Minutes", it's all good.  In "Give It 2 Me", we have our girl stirring up the usual excitement (and trouble).  "She's Not Me" is very interesting lyrically - no low self-esteem here!  "Incredible" begins with a sort of mainstream adult contemporary melody beefed up by the muscle of technology, then morphs into very current pop.  "Beat Goes On" is a very appropriate title for track #8, because it continues a recurring theme of Madonna's - get up, celebrate, dance, holiday, etc.  And I love her yelling "Hey!" in the latter half of the track.  "Dance 2Night" reminds me vaguely of some disco sound, maybe Chic?  "Spanish Lesson" is a good track, and I really wish she would record a whole song in Spanish.  In the last 2 tracks, "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You" and "Voices", good times are coming to an end as we hear themes of wickedness and madness, accompanied by serious, dramatic musical arrangements.  But of course, the beat is intact!		In my review of "GHV2", in which I referred to that period as "the Clinton years", I said that hopefully we would get another volume from Madonna for the Bush years.  Since this is her last album for Warner, that could actually happen.  Meanwhile, just enjoy this latest gift from on high.
0,Nas is the emcee responsible for the most poetic and deep hiphop LP of all time- Illmatic. That was 1994. Who would have thought he would still be putting it down today. This album is really nice stuff. From the first track of the God's Son to the last it is pure magic. "Get down" is a perfect track to start the album off with a bang. Next you have "The Cross", interestingly produced by Eminem(not a bad beat either). My favorite track is "The Last Nigga Alive", its beat is pure hiphop and Nas' lyrics on the track describes a history of the east coast rap scene in the early ninty's. VERY SWEET STUFF. There is even a Jay-z dis on the track too, which entertains me thoroughly. Peace
0,i got this for my girlfriend, who just started bellydancing a couple months.  There are alot of different speed songs for different movements and rhythms.  Beautiful and well-done, its good listening even if you're not a bellydancer.
0,Odd but great album
0,AAAA
0,I've loved Dorothy Collins voice from the first time I heard the cast recording of Sondheim's Follies.  It's such a beautiful instrument perfectly fit for Christmas songs.  The album is half religious songs (Silent Night, Hark the Herald Angels Sing, The First Noel, O Come All Ye Faithful, It Came Upon A Midnight Clear, O Little Town Of Bethlehem, Good King Wenceslas)  and half secular songs (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, White Christmas, Deck the Halls, I'll Be Home For Christmas, Silver Bells).  The arrangements a beautiful, perfectly suited for Christmas.
0,This 5-CD set of Tchaikovsky's symphonies and overtures with the Utah Symphony Orchestra conducted by Maurice Abravanel is worth a whole lot more than it costs. While the Utah SO is smaller and less polished than world class ensembles such as the Philadelphia Orchestra or the Berlin PO, its conductor, M. Abravanel, had a natural flair for Tchaikovsky and renders outstanding performances of all but one work featured here. The standouts are the Manfred Symphony and the Fourth Symphony, both among the very best I have ever heard, and I am very picky about performances of these two works! The Manfred is given a dramatic and exciting account that doesn't get bogged down in the weightiness of the tragedy but still succeeds in capturing all the drama of Byron's story. This performance now surpasses by previous favorite--Markevitch/LSO--which, despite the virtuosity and Russian sound that Markevitch coaxes out of the LSO, doesn't have the level of commitment or excitement that the Utah players under Abravanel bring to it. This performance also has far better sound quality than the Markevitch and Abravanel's overall conception is far superior to recent recordings such as the overly heavy Jurowski/LPO. The relative small size of the Utah orchestra isn't even a liability here. The same goes for the Fourth Symphony, given a very exciting performance, in which the drama of the Fate theme is given prominence in the outer movements and the inner movements are carried along swiftly and with forward propulsion. The brass section is very strong and I don't find the strings lacking here. This performance is the most enjoyable one that I own. (Mravinsky's Leningrad account on DG is more hard-hitting but less enjoyable to listen to.) Among the overtures, the standout is Marche Slave, given a crackerjack performance that really brings down the house--one of the best Marche Slaves out there.		The remaining symphonies are all done really well: The Polish (No. 3) is given the most exciting performance I've ever heard (although it's still Tchaikovsky's weakest symphony). The First and Second are, again, very exciting, especially the finales. The Sixth is the most classically poised performance I've heard; the lean textures of the orchestra bring a clarity (details that are rarely heard) to this symphony that is exceptional. Abravanel's deliberate pacing makes this Sixth dramatic but not disturbing (unlike Mravinsky's classic Leningrad account). The Fifth is my least favorite performance in this set, mainly because the string section isn't lush enough for this work and because the recording is a bit dry. But Abravanel gives it all he's got; there's no faulting his tempos or overall approach. The last three minutes are actually among the most exciting I've ever heard. The 1812 Overture is great--incisively played, and with exciting effects at the end. Hamlet is very exciting and melodramatic, as it should be. Romeo and Juliet is done very well, just lacking a bit in the strings. The only dud is Francesca da Rimini, which despite Abravanel's efforts, is too tepid. (It's still better than Jarvi's lame performance on Chandos.)		The sound quality for these 1972-73 performances is really great, among the best of analog recordings and better than many digital recordings! This set is worthwhile just for the Manfred and Fourth Symphony performances. With three additional CDs with great performances, this set would be worth buying at double the price they're asking. At the asking price, one would be foolish not to grab this one.
0,I bought this album in 1967 at a Woolworth's cutout rack for $1.99. I was enthralled with what was happening in San Francisco at the time, and any band that released a disc was on my turntable. When I got it home, the Ramones-like pace was an unexpected blast into the center of my brain and ignighted all the nerves & synaps in my teenybopper body. I still connect to it the same way many, many, many (did I say many?) years later. I smile remembering the cheesy organ rave up & the first chords to "Golden Road to Unlimited Devotion". Par-ty ev-ver-ery day! (Full disclosure: I'm more of a Nuggets garage punk kind of gal. I didn't really "get" the Dead beyond the first four albums until I was middle aged.) Better late than never.
0,Their wonderful best, Maggie really shines on this one. Enjoy the universe, Margaret A. Roche!
0,Just got it today-7/25/2015!! I love it!! Awesome!! Fantastic!! Amazon is like a Xmas Wonderland!! I will be doing all of my shopping here!! Great music store!! Great!! Amazon has everything you could ever imagine or want!! :o)
0,I had this album when it was just vinyl.  Played it to death.  Just love Carole King and bought this album to bring back good memories.
0,Very good CD a must have for this artists
0,Great playing here, a  feww rough spots, but over all a  masterful performance, Nimbus has no clue how to mic and record a  piano cd. Echos /distortion all over.	Indeed a  mind blowing performance at certain tracks.		Just arrived. Great playing, superior to his earlier recording from 1959, although I like that one too.	I can not place this set over my new recent purchases, and what surprises have I discovered.	Look for my reviews on many new Ravel piano solo sets.	Ck out Alders. UNREAL	Short on time, I can recommend this set, but *the best*? Can't say that.	As I say you have Bavouzet, Tharaud, Rouvier, now Aldpers with yet another fine pianist on the way in the mail.	Alpers recording was  huge find. Tremendous genius Hinrich Alpers.		Paul		New Orleans		OK UPDATE after further listening, 3 stars. Fora  75 yr old man, this is exceptional playing.		But I am looking for the brighter poetic colors offered by Alpers, Tharaud(some isses on his playing) Bavouzet, Osborne (EXCEPTIONAL!!!	Playing here) and the 1 cd from Vinnitskaya, ck out her youtbue of ravel's Gaspard, U		Ravel wished his music stay within the perimeter of his score, but really is that all we wish for?	Do we not wish for LIFE to be breathed into the score yet w/o personality of the artist?	Not easy/simple to pull off. Tharaud goes to the very limits, I havea  few issues with his STELLAR skills.	Alpers is UNREAL, Osborne is super UNREAL. Watch Vinnitskaya on youtube play Gaspard. UNREALLLLL	Her 1 cd is on the way.	Perelmuter is 3  stars based on what Alpers, Bavouzet, Tharaud, Osborne brings to the score. Valdo plays just as Ravel wished *allow the \	notes to speak for themself, no interference from the arttist*. That may be because there were so many bad poor pianists back in his day.	Only Vines could play Ravel. Vlado lacks a  dimension which the others mention bring to the score. Which is MAGIC, the notes lift off the	score and float across the room		Listen to Vlado in Menute Antique, DEAD, wayyyy too slow, murders the beautiful piece. Listen to ALPERS. Now that is a  MENUTE ANTIQUE!!!!!. How can I or anyone give this late 70's Vlado at 75 yrs anything over 2 stars???? TYell me after listening to Alpers, Osborne, Bavouzet, perhaps Tharaud, and as well Vinnitskaya solo cd (Gaspard Miroirs),	2 Stars for Vlado's *last finale attempt at Ravel*.		Paul	Ravelian	New Orleans
0,It's a good variety of known voices.  A few singers put a little twist on the sound; a couple need to let Guy sing it for himself.
0,"I'm like Tyson icin' I'm a soldier at war/ Makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more".  As soon as you hear the sirens, the detective calling for backup, and the dramatic backdrop, you can't help but be submerged into the albums first song.  "I'm Bad" is youthful arrogance personified.  An all-time bragadoccio classic.  LL crushes his competition like jelly beans, proclaims himself the greatest in the history of rap itself, and even when he's bragging he's just being sincere.  Being so bad never felt good and that maybe the albums only downfall is that it starts off so strong it never quite reaches it's climax again.  Although "I'm Bad" is one of the greatest songs LL has done there are many treats to find here.		The Hip Hop and R & B marriage of "I Need Love" is another all-time great.  Although risky (and made a hardcore following somewhat disgruntled) it trail blazed countless love song based Hip Hop records after it.  In complete contrast to this song were many great battle type records such as ".357 Break It Down".  Lyrics like, "Callin all cars for the brother in black/ L-E-L the Mack back bone of this track/I'ma force full of force to put you on your back/Makin hit after hit while you search for a contract/" are as lethal as anything on "I'm Bad".  Another intriguing song is "The Breakthrough" with a excellent drum bass sample driven track.  The subject matter may not be very diversified but it's hard not to love LL braggin' and boastin' in his prime!  The albums sleeper is "My Rhyme Ain't Done".  The way he compares his rhymes to a game of cards is very creative and it is another favorite.		Then I hung out with a king and a queen	And the queen put me down with her polo team	The way I scored points all around the clock	I had her daughter, the princess ridin my jock	I knocked the freak off like a crazy retard	Then I took a little trip into a deck of cards	The diamond jack joker and the ace of spades	Was amazed at greater Cut Creator on the fade	Then I played cards with the queen of clubs	The queen of hearts with me cold fell in love	As for the queen of diamonds, she don't like men	Because you know that a diamond is a girl's best friend	The double-trouble spade was named the deuce	And the joker acted stupid, so we gave him the news	There was 52 cards, and I met everyone	That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done		"Bigger and Deffer" is a great if imperfect offering from the start of the golden era.  In my opinion, it is LL Cool J's second best album in his catalogue, behind the versatile "Mama Said Knock You Out".  I know that this album changed many peoples lives, mainly due to the impact from the two singles.  I would highly recommend this album to anybody who is an old school rap fan.
0,I've always enjoyed music from the mid and late 1960s; and this CD has lots of it! We get twenty-six tunes on this album. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is also well done; we even get chart information for these songs and I like that, too.		The Turtles start it all off with their huge hit, "Happy Together." The guitars and drums round out the tune and The Turtles perform this flawlessly. Now THIS is great music! The Critters do "Younger Girl;" and "98.6" by Keith made the airwaves sizzle back in the day! "98.6" is easily a major highlight of this album; and it brings back fond memories for me! Tommy James and the Shondells do their awesome "Crystal Blue Persuasion" with a lot of style; they actually do this with a lot of sensitivity and it's very professional, good quality music.		The Beach Boys do their very catchy "Darlin';" I could never tire of hearing them to this one! The Lemon Pipers turn in a good performance with their "Green Tambourine;" and listen for yet another gem in "A Girl like You" by The Rascals. Wowzer! The Fifth Dimension also makes good when they do "Workin' on a Groovy Thing;" The Fifth Dimension was one of the very best and just one listen tells you why!		The Friends of Distinction play and sing "Grazing in the Grass" with lots of positive energy; this electric tune really shines even all these years later! They handle fast tempo and key changes like pros, too; and I'm very impressed. The Association scored a huge hit with their "Time for Livin';" they deliver this to perfection--and beyond! And, of course, The Mamas & The Papas come in strong with their terrific CD highlight, "I Saw Her Again." "I Saw Her Again" proves just how talented The Mamas & The Papas really were.		Spanky and Our Gang perform "Lazy Day" with some mighty fine percussion; the music fits in perfectly with the lyrics and it all holds its own very well. I love it! Harpers Bizarre is wonderful as they do their "Anything Goes;" and I really like Mercy's "Love (Can Make You Happy)." The CD also ends strong with The Cowsills performing "The Rain, The Park and Other Things." What a great way to end this album!		Chartbusters USA: Sunshine Pop is tailor made for fans of pop music from the mid to late 1960s. Sure, as a single CD compilation it could never be complete; but it stands very strong as it is and I highly recommend it for fans of this genre of music. It's even a good introductory album for people just discovering the magical sounds of the mid to late 1960s.
0,The battle champion is back with his official sophomore LP. Walz as a rapper is an amalgamation of several styles. We all know that he is a proven battle emcee with more wins than we can count. But on his album he breaks off into other styles equal parts gangsta & conscious, but always dope. C-Rayz comes through on this album with a mix of beats that show the second coming of Def Jux. Most of the producers are cats that I've never heard of but I think that we will all be checkin for em after listening to this album. The lyrical topic's he touches on is wide. He discusses the problems with race and skin color in this hip hop game on "Blackout". He and Vordul Mega get gully on "Street Reppin". Then he flips it and attacks all the wannabe gangsta's out their on "Pink". He does not let up once on the album always spittin that raw and real sh*t for ya brain, and overall he succeeds in continuing the monstrous year that Def Jux is having by delivering an album that will make it onto several top ten year end lists
0,Ever since this legendary band reformed in 1999 it has very much been with Neil Young at the steering wheel. He has chosen the backing bands and he has vetoed any official releases from their prevoius, highly succesful tours, in 2000 and '02.		This isn't a proper livealbum either, but the soundtrack to his film about the band's "Freedom Of Speech" tour in '06, promoting Neil's "Living With War" album.		Where the tour was a mix of new and old songs, and the 30+ songlist somewhat equally shared between the four great songwriters, here it's all Neil, with 9 out of 16 songs being from "Living..", while the other three have to share the remaining 7. That Neil is by far the most succesful through the years, commercially and mediawise, hardly justify such a malproportion. And although I can wholeheratedly agree with Neil's poignant lyrics about War, Iraq and Mr. Bush, the musical qualities of his new tunes are more dubious.		The highlights of the CD is undoubtly the fine versions of the classics "Deja Vu" and "Wooden Ships", where it sounds like a band and where we get some of the famous twin leadguitar interplay between Neil and Stephen Stills. Whereas CSN is hardly audible through the new Neil songs. It's also on the classic tracks that the impeccable backing musicians really gel, not least the fine bassplayer Rick Rosas and drummer Chad Cromwell.		As evidenced by their recent collaborations with David Gilmour ("Island" and the live-DVD) David Crosby and Graham Nash are in topform vocally, whereas Stephen isn't, he doesn't even sing on his own "Find The Cost Of Freedom", but plays some fine guitar - when he's allowed to step out that is.		But else it's all Neil, and he's certainly in great form through out.		A fine release by one of the all-time greatest bands, though I personally would have preferred a whole show.
0,I was surprised to find this contains two LP records as well as the CD album. The music is amazing - "two Hearted Spider", "Hyena" and "Sugar" are a few of my favourites on this album, which I think is truly their best album yet.		Both records appear fine, but like most Amazon records I've received it skips, but I chalk this down to static, as it plays fine at different speeds. CD works beautifully, but comes in a slim plastic sleeve.		Sleeves for both LPs have tracklists on one side, and glorious black and white photos on the other. This band is amazing, and this record is their best work yet. Highly recommended.
0,You really cant go wrong with anything that has 2pac's name on it. Always a good listen. Better than what they rap about nowadays.
0,I heard of this pair from Andy, the lead singer of Autopassion.	They didn't have an album at the time, just a myspace.  The few songs that were on their page got me hooked.  I bought this record the instant I new it existed.  I like every song, my kids like it and my wife says it's okay.  That's a good review from Mrs. 80's.  They took old video game sounds and created a new sensation.  If you like techno, house, industrial, or loud house music or if you are a fan of old video games you should buy this record.
0,I'm a big Jake Owen. I need to purchase more of his music.  Keep them coming - I have to review what you have
0,This remarkable album featured something new in blues-rock music. Mayall formed a band with no drums and no electric lead guitar, relying on the bass of Steven Thompson to keep the rhythm, and substituting acoustic "finger-style" guitar in place of the blistering electric licks that had been a prominent feature of Mayall's style. The format was not new to Mayall; the liner notes to the "Room to Move" compilation state that he got the idea from another, less well-known band. Regardless, Mayall's sound on Turning Point was unique; the use of woodwinds and acoustic guitar, combined with Mayall's harmonica, flirted around the outermost fringes of jazz, and the live tracks presented here are smooth and flowing, reaching a peak in the magnificent "California" which became a staple of FM radio for a time. "Room to Move" was the closest Mayall would ever come to a bona fide hit in the U.S.	Unfortunately, this was a turning point for John Mayall, commercially and artistically. Shortly after this release, blues went out of fashion, and the quality of Mayall's work plummeted. The no-drums format became increasingly difficult to work with in large, noisy concert halls and was eventually scrapped.	Mayall has returned to produce fine work in the 1980s and 1990s; his most recent release, "Stories", is one of his best; and he released first-rate albums such as "Chicago Line" and "A sense of Place" in the 80s. At close to 70, he is still recording and performing new work, but "The Turning Point" remains the high watermark of his career. This is one of the great albums of the 1960s, and one not to be missed.	This version has three "extra" tracks, and I'm happy to say that they're excellent and well worth the price of the disc, even if you own a copy of the original CD.  I wish there was more of this stuff!
0,Great CD Thanks seller.
0,Excellent, reflective music.  Perfect for unwinding after stressful days or just relaxing on an easy kind of day.
0,This is a really great set and all the CD'S are in cases. This makes it very heavy, but, worth it's weight in gold. The certificate of authenticity is actually the label on the side of the outer cardboard custom made container. Unfortunately, even the sellers aren't aware of this.
0,This album and this group have been growing on me for months. I like the Marcin Wasilewski Trio much better than Keith Jarrett. Even though Keith Jarrett is a genius and may have superior technical skills, I like Marcin's presentation way better.		The tempo and complexity of Marcin's playing is fascinating to listen to. In that regard he is superior to Tord Gustavsen who's music is just a bit too slow and simplistic for me.		I also love the drummer, drummer Michal Miskiewicz very much. He has a very nice touch and at times he'll throw in a surprise. Marcin has played with numerous European jazz stars, Tomaz Stanko, Jan Gabarek and others. Marcin has been with the Trio's bassist and drummer, Kurkiewicz, Miskiewicz for a very long time, since they were in their teens.		"Trio" is a really superb album. It's their first album as a trio. In my review of their later album, "January" I said that I thought "January" was a little more polished. But I can't get enough of either of these two albums. The music is just so captivating. They have remained at the top of my playlist for months. I recommend albums both highly.		I just hope a new Marcin Wasilewski Trio album is on the near horizon!
0,Twenty years after I first heard it, this album still makes its way into regular rotation on my stereo. This is a collection of brilliant songs recorded at the peak of Devo's career; compositionally superb, lyrically eloquent, catchy and singable. And it rocks - albeit in a robotic, highly quantized way.	Even setting aside the radio hit ("Whip It," as if you didn't know), the album has so many of my favorite Devo songs: Girl U Want, Freedom of Choice, Gates of Steel, Ton O Luv, the weirdly touching Snowball... there's not a bad song on there.	What makes this album so perfect is that it keeps the weirdness and edginess of their previous albums, but adds in a few shades of pop. Regrettably, this mixture only succeeded for one more album (New Traditionalists) before they started leaning too far to the pop side of the fence. I think by the time the album "Shout" was released they had thrown away their guitars completely, which made me sad. Also, some of my favorite songs were written by Jerry Casale, whose compositions are notably absent from later Devo albums. I've always wondered about that.	The original LP also had the most hilarious (or was it serious?) record sleeve - a catalog of the oddest Devo products imaginable. To this day I regret not ordering the leisure suit.	I hear people compare this band with other supposed "new wave" bands, whatever that means. Two comparisons work for me - Oingo Boingo and Talking Heads. If you like them, you will most definitely like this.
0,This is spoken by Roger after the renditon of "Wish You Were Here". I wonder who he was talking about. Any thoughts?	 However I love this CD. If your looking for Floyd tunes played note for note, sound for sound. Look elsewhere. The songs have a new groove and a wild guitar sound by Andy Fairweather Low That Dave would have killed for. I hated to say that but it's true. I'm as big a Gilmour fan as anyone, but when "shine On" and 'Saucerfull..." started to jam i was hooked. It's the Dave sound with a new twist. Which is what Floyd music should be all about. Do you think they played "Intersteller Overdrive " the same way twice?
0,100 stars for the best worship album ever.
0,Came as expected! Thank you!
0,I really appreciate all of Billy Joel's records.  However his early releases:  Cold Spring Harbor, Turnstiles, and this one are special probably because they are not so overplayed on the radio.  The title track is so haunting its beautiful.  Los Angelinos boogies along quite nicely as Billy's band adds nice support.  And two instrumentals- the subdued Mexican Connection with its accentuated rhythms and the jolly bingo hall styled Root Beer Rag.  The Entertainer may be the hit single with its catchy lyrics but overall this record is very consistent and quite varied.
0,The truth of Matt Maher's lyrics stands out at the forefront of this remarkable album. There are none of the cliche's and overused lyrics that often clutter Christian music on display here. From the quietest moments on the album such as the acknowledgement on "Heaven and Earth" (the song from which the album gets its title) that "You're all I need" through to the blessed hope of all the saints in "The Spirit and the Bride": "Amen! Amen! Come Lord Jesus,come again!" Matt's love for Christ and the Church He has given us rings out.		Having really enjoyed every album Matt has released up to this point, I have loved seeing the growth in his songwriting and song-style in this new album. While his first 4 albums had a very strong "praise and worship" feel to all of the music, we began to see him pull away from this slightly with some songs on "Alive Again" having a far more mainstream appeal. This growth has reached a new height in "The Love In Between", with a collection of songs that show a distinct love for contemporary rock with a slight country tinge to it!		While "Overflow" remains the Matt Maher album that reaches me most up to this point, largely due to the strong connections it has to the beauty of Catholic worship in the Mass, "The Love In Between" is a beautiful album with a collection of songs that talk about our Christian life and how Jesus is the Love between Heaven and Earth.		Beautiful in its production, orthodox in its message and a gift to christian music and the music world at large, I would recommend this album to anyone who has enjoyed Matt's music up to this point, and to anyone who enjoys contemporary christian rock.
0,Heard the interviews on NPR and Colbert report (freakin' liberal) and was intrigued with what I heard.  This is just a lovely record.  Fantastic, world class musicians having a ball and making great music.  Can't get much better than this.  I would call the style celtic-old-time fusion, but the range is quite wide.  I truly hope these guys stay together and make more music together.
0,The first and only Mimi album/compilation out there that's not pricey. All the rest are out of print or never issued on vinyl. It's good to hear these classics on this medium than the digital sound we have these days. I don't even have a CD copy of this. It's not worth to add to many of Mimi's greatest hits collection. But since it's the only one issued on vinyl, better buy it.
0,this cd, has the best of boston for sure.the songs are good for relaxing while in bed trying to sleep.
0,I bought "Miles Davis in Europe" on vinyl over 30 years ago & never got tired of listening to it - a great band recording great music just before Miles went off into his abstract period.		One of the distinctive apects of this classic disc is the piano playing of Herbie Hancock. His geometric solos & ornamentations are endlessly interesting, perfectly complementing the ethereal playing of Miles Davis & George Coleman.		Despite all of the kudos for the fine "Friday & Saturday Night at the Blackhawk" sessions, I think "In Europe" is much more interesting.		One side note - the cd cover reproduces the original album art, which mistakenly identifies the recording as stereo. The sound, which is excellent, is actually mono.
0,For anyone who loves doommetal like i do this cd is a must! Think old my dying bride and paradise lost and even old paramaecium! BUY THIS YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!
0,This is a terrific Rom album, straight from Hungary and Romania.		Very nice.
0,happy with item
0,An extraordinary CD with the most famous formation of Los Panchos, the one with Alfredo Gil, Chucho Navarro and Johnny Albino, plus the sweet touch of Eydie Gorme. These songs could be called the latin standards, and it's very beautiful to know that the famous "Cuando vuelva a tu lado", composed by Mar&iacute;a Grever, was adopted by Sarah Vaughan and by her great art transformed into the jazz standard "What a difference a day makes". This CD, an incredible peace of art produced by the old CBS, deserve all the eulogies written by Amazon critics. Voices, lyrics, guitars... songs transmited in families, sung at home... Great album, great work.
0,This is an odd greatest hits / remix collection of Michael Nyman's soundtrack music for Peter Greenaway's films, plus two tracks from 'Water Dances' (which are not otherwise available in orchestrated form). Similar  in concept to Kraftwerk's 'The Mix', the music has been re-arranged in a  generally bouncier, upbeat style to the original - whilst 'Chasing Sheep'  has a new, sad-sounding middle-eight, 'Wheelbarrow Walk' is utterly jolly,  and the transition from the calmness of the first 'Water Dance' to the  frenzy of the last (sounding rather like an Elmer Bernstein western movie  score) is amusing. The music from 'The Cook', on the other hand, is  uniformly doom-laden, fitting the humourless tone of the film quite well,  whilst the single extract from 'Prospero's Books' seems to meander a lot  without going anywhere. It's a great introduction / compilation of his  pre-Hollywood score music, and along with the soundtrack to 'Drowning by  Numbers' is an essential Michael Nyman purchase.
0,Okay fans don't shoot me.  I was a fan of Pearl Jam when they first came out with 'Ten' and 'Vs', however, they lost me.  I started finding them pretentious and preachy so I just lost interest.  However, I was interested when I heard they had released a Greatest Hits package.	First, the positives...every track is a winner (I don't even mind their version of 'Last Kiss' even though i HATED it on the radio).  The album is very reasonably priced and has a s$#t load of music on it.  My only real criticism I have that made me give it four stars instead of five is the overwhelming number of tracks from the first two albums (that anyone even remotely interested in PJ must already own).  I was really hoping for more tracks from their later albums that I am less familiar with.  However, the tracks that are included are wonderful and I probably will get more of their later albums because of them.	New favourite - 'Man of the Hour'.
0,As any avid collector knows, most Greatest Hits, Best of..., Essential Collection of... any artist(s) are devoid of one or two songs that are fundamental to the artists resume. The Hollies are no exception to the politics of record companies marketing. I needed this for my collection, having enjoyed the album when it was first released (pre-cd). This collection includes Dear Eloise and King Midas in Reverse, which are not included in other collelctions. What makes this collection stand out from all the others is the sound!. I am generally sold by the "UMPH" of a pressing. This collection has it! If you're in the market to buy any Hollies collection, Buy this one! Great selection. Great Sound!
0,Is there another Led Zeppelin that I don't know about ?!?!  They are the best metal band EVER !!  And their critics ???		Where are they now ???		....probably in their 60's and living in their Mom's basement... again...		PS - A REAL cabbie's tip for you...	 The building on this album cover is located in NYC on St. Mark's place ... FYI ...  ;)
0,A very enjoyable CD to listen to. The tracks, from first to last, are thoroughly enjoyable and this is definitely music to get you moving!
0,THIS IS A MUST I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE PRICE COMES DOWN GOOD VIBRATION IS THE JOINT SO FUNKY IT IS MUSIC TO YOUR EAR'S AND ALL THE REST YOU KNOW IS HISTORY THIS IS THIER BEST TO ME THIS IS WHAT I CALL GOOD FUNKY MUSIC. I TURNED SOME OF MY FRIENDS ON TO THIS AND THEY WERE LIKE WHO'S THATI SAID KOOL N THE GANG  THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A NEW JAM .
0,Andrea Bocelli's voice is becoming an addictive elixir to me. I must  always have more, and thankfully there are so many new Bocelli items coming  as I note credit to divadome.com/bocelli and the fellow fans I have met  through the net.  Verdi is a beautiful ride that I'm sure will bring more  passengers in the next few months.  Verdi contains familiar arias and  challenge Bocelli more than any of his other work, but comforts you with  the smooth style that he has which is certainly a gift.
0,Carole King's music was so important to me growing up.  I must have played Rhymes & Reasons on my rickety plastic record player 5000 times during my college years.  That's what I love the most about this CD - the songs that are just CK and her piano.  However, these demos also have the dimension of a young songwriter selling her work, just doing everything she can to get it out there.  If I am not mistaken, most of these demos were recorded while CK was still basically a songwriter and musician, playing piano behind her friend James Taylor onstage.  The photos and the biographical liner notes are priceless.  Like many of the other reviewers here, I just want to hear more.  I know they're out there!
0,happy
0,the first time i heard their single,`special' on mtv, i was bowled over by their music...		love the lead singer's voice,so sweet,sometimes androgynous,i have to say...:]		this album is worth buying for the discerning music lovers..worth every penny..
0,Crush is a good effort by Bon Jovi but its by far not their strongest  release.  There are two rocking tunes on the CD, the first track It's My  Life (Which is a great song, one of their Best) and the last track One Wild  Life.	Tracks 2 through 11 seem to be less Bon Jovi-esque as they range  from low tempo Ballad's to mid tempo Beetleish sounding tunes. I'm not  saying that they are bad songs,some are actually pretty good, but some of  these are not what you would expect when you go back and listen to older  rocking tunes like Faith, Runaway and You Give Love a Bad  Name.	Bottomline, It's a good CD worth picking up....just expect a little  change to the Bon Jovi sound that you are used to!!!
0,Having seen ERIC live and being very dissapointed, I agonized over buying this CD. Sorry I waited this long. I think that TONE is average at best, but this is a great CD. Now I understand the fuss about ERIC JOHNSON. His tone is almost violin like on some tracks and the instrumental compositions are 1st class. His playing is brilliant and stays away from cliche's. That often means eccentric and hard to listen too tones and stylings. Not on this, it is different but always a joy to listen too. Inspirational if you play the guitar yourself. Besides your jaw hitting your chest any number of times, this is very accessible guitar virtuosity. I felt that on TONE he was clever for cleverness sake. This is free of ego boosting trickery and concentrates on composition and content. His singing still leaves me cold, but is far less intrusive than on TONE.
0,Pretty solo playing on this CD.  A love the piano more than anything else.  Kinda reminds me of December by Winston.  Simple but beautiful.
0,Of the 3 solo CDs Oswalt has released so far, this is the best.  The writing is sharp, the performance is tight, the laughs are many.		Oswalt must have thanked the Comedy Gods when he had the presence of mind to dismantle his heckler the way he did on this album.  You don't get to hear that every day on an album.		Terrific.
0,I'm the least religious person I know...quite an atheist in fact.  I often resent when religion creeps into ostensibly or otherwise secular albums (i.e., my reaction to the recent Rosie Thomas cd was quite strong and negative for this reason). But...		I wonder at the few negative reviews LIFELINE has received here.  I haven't been so moved by an album in ages.  In fact, LIFELINE turned me to mush.  I've always loved Iris as one of our best songwriters and most affecting singers.  My reaction is likely heightened by having just read the biographical essay about her in the new issue of NO DEPRESSION.  It deals with the past eight years since her last album (the great THE WAY I SHOULD), the hate mail she received from some of the songs on that album, the more viruluent response she got when she cancelled a concert out of conscience about her tax dollars supporting the war in Iraq, her writers' block, her periods of depression, her divorce and remarriage to Greg Brown.  Most important how she goes back to the old church songs from her Pentecostal past to make her feel better and alive.		I simply can't fathom how anyone who loves Iris can resist the exquisite simple arrangements here, her incredible heart-rending singing, her beautiful piano accompaniment to her own voice, the simple acoustic instruments accompanying her, and the fabulous harmony vocalists.		To paraphrase from that NO DEPRESSION interview and the album notes, her mother told a weeping Iris over the phone, "Iris! You gotta get to a 'pe-yan-a'."  She has.  How lucky we are that she did.  A real winner and a definite mush-inducer.
0,With Horenstein, Abbado, Kubelik, Bernstein, Masur, and Tilson Thomas as benchmarks for this curious musical statement, Levi and the Atlantans earn good marks on clarity, pacing, and spirit.  Mahler's Seventh is full of shock value, irregular tonalities, nocturnal mystery, and overblown excess.  With this performance you'll find room to grow and expand your aural palette and come to appreciate this strangely happy work more and more.
1,Eddie is a great singer, probably one of the most important soul singers of our times, but his comedy albums are just awful.  Check out his musical releases, like "Loves Alright".
1,Limp Bizkit's ridiculously titled "Chocolate Starfish & Hot Dog Flavored Water" is exactly what it calls itself: a piece of a chocolate starfish that has puckered itself too tightly.  The album's overall performance, which remains extremely inferior to their sophomore release "Significant Other", is disappointing and seems to be driven by their immense success of their previous album -- while completely ignoring the quality of the music.	"Hot Dog", an awful rip of Nine Inch Nail's "Closer", is an opening track that praises their own band's success while trying to sound hard at the same time.  Bragging about the amount of f**ks they use during the song along with an outlandish sense of trying to sound comprehensible deteriorates Limp Bizkit's original image of being unique.	Other tracks including "Full Nelson" and "Boiler Room" just shows that the band threw together what they could as quickly as possible -- leaving most fans slightly annoyed with the band's new make-up.  While "Rollin'" is both catchy and entertaining, the rest of the album seems like egotistical rambling that becomes just plain annoying by the fourth track.	Limp Bizkit, brilliant in their "Significant Other" album, has released a weak and boring album that, unfortunately, does not catch the essence that Limp Bizkit had on their previous albums: a band that successfully combines rap with hard rock.
1,I caught this show on Vh1, and this show was absolutely atrocious. I never really thought much of Britney Spears, in fact I happen to enjoy some of Britney's past hits, but this show made me see what a trashy, narcissistic, air-headed person she truly is. All she did was ask everyone about their favorite sexual positions, and telling everyone else how many times she's done it with K-fed (Oh Lawd). Yes, then there is K-fed, I'm not sure if he actually spoke throughout the show, he did occasionally smile like a dumb ass, and now that I recall he did say a couple of things that sounded pretty idiotic like "love is love" (O RLY?) while Britney zoomed up close to him with her video camera, which for some reason she couldn't happen to hold straight. I did laugh when I saw Britney trying to interpret one of her hotel room paintings, and she pretty much says that the painting is about her and her situation with K-fed (No, Brit, not everything is about you, bb.). Last, but not least, the grand finale, the wedding, which was just tacky. So to summarize everything, this show was a certified hot mess.
1,Minus "Tubthumping", listening to this album is equal to putting your head in the frig. and slamming the door! Avoid the hype. Not even good dance music.
1,A very overrated album by a very overrated band. U2, with its incantatory vocals, its asthmatic guitar riffs and its sententious messages, has always been closer to church music than to rock n'roll. If you think this is rock, you must be either 15 or 85.
1,This is one lousey album, the lyrics are terrible and I mean beyond terrible they are even annoying they are so poorly written.  The music itself is run of the mill nothing special or memorible, just radio garbage.  Typical forgetable late 90's band.
1,After releasing two wonderful albums, Alive Behind The Green Door and Swagger, I was quite anxious to hear Flogging Molly's new album...	Words can't express the feeling of disappointment I felt (and still do) after listening to Drunken Lullabies.	Where the first two albums of course warranted comparisons to mighty Pogues, they established and built on FM's individual personality... Which I had hoped they would continue to do on their third release.	But no. Almost every song on here can be traced back to Pogues, beat for beat, instrument for instrument. I understand that many fantastic artists, including Shane MacGowan himself are known for thinly disguising songs that inspire them as their own work - reworking traditional tunes and adding themselves into the music... but Drunken Lullabies just doesn't pull it off. Everytime I listen to it, I get frustrated, turn it off and put on The Pogues instead.	Even the last time I saw them play live - a concert on St. Paddy's day, I ended up leaving early... okay a big part of that was the venue's lack of Irish whiskey and serving overpriced Guinness in little plastic cups - but the point is, I had never walked out of a Flogging Molly show before! (and haven't been to one since)	It's a shame and I for one, hope they can win their fans back over next time. I know they're better than this release demonstrates. The other albums PROVE it.
1,I bought this Cd after listening to all of these reveiws on this forum. You guys owe me $10.00.	First this CD is nothing new or great. It is very well produced and the lyrics are OK (if your a teenager). I saw them on Carson Daly late at night and they seemed to play Ok live, but then I noticed their fan base and then it struct me. All of these reviews have to be from MTV teen-boppers. This Cd is not that great. I asked my cousin about them and he said that they do have a cult following but come on people their are so many better Indie CD's out.	PLEASE........... Open your minds to better music. Modest Mouse, Appleseed Cast,Sonic Youth, Radiohead,Built to Spill, ECT....
1,This is Joe's THIRD live CD in the last 10 years.  While I enjoyed the DVD...this CD does not seem to have the same sound quality.  The instruments sound muddled and really the only new material that has not been released before are the tracks featuring special guests.  If you have the DVD already great...if not perhaps you should get the DVD instead because this CD is just not up to par.
1,I have yet to hear a "tribute" album that is worth the time it takes to listen, but I still get drawn into buying them.	Here's the problem with "tribute" records: if the artists go the note-for-note reproduction route, what's the point?  Who cares if Phish can reproduce "5:15"?  (They don't quite, by the way.  They play the same notes, but all of the passion of the original is sucked out of the performance, and the vocals sound like they were done after running a marathon)  If you want to hear the original, you listen to the original...right?	If the artists go for reinterpretation, who cares?  How many people listen to the Who's version of "Pictures Of Lily" and wishes it had been slower and sung in a smug monotone, ala David Bowie's version here?  Classic songs done differently--with some very rare exceptions, like Hendrix's "All Along The Watchtower" and Joe Cocker's "She Came In Through The Bathroom Window"--don't work.	Perhaps most dissapointing of all is the generally lazy vocals on this CD.  Eddie Veder always sounds like he's asleep on his feet, but Sheryl Crow, David Bowie, and the singers for Phish and Fastball all sound like they phoned it in too.	Paul Weller comes off best here, but that may just be because he has spent his entire career imitating the Who.
1,...musically worthless. Sure it changed everything, but if it's too annoying to listen to more than two times what good is it? If you want real punk greatness, get the Ramones first album, they were revolutionary. The  Sex Pistols were just about image and nothing else.
1,No song list Wont buy
1,This guy is totally butchering all those great songs. Poor Freddie must be spinning in his grave. George Michael could have done such a better job singing any of the Queen songs. This clown lost all his voice already,so why  put him on stage to destroy this great music. It is on insult to Freddie's legacy.
1,...the time I recorded the audio of myself taking a s*** when I was deathly ill.  I mean, seriously.  They should change the title of the album from "Overexposed" to "Overdone Piece of Crap."
1,Once upon a time Matthew Sweet created fantastic, often beautiful, songs. Apparently having grown bored with this, he decided to focus his considerable talents on creating covers with ex-Bangle Susanna Hoffs. Track after track I'm amazed at the lack of imagination this duo has put into their covers album series. Note to the artists: If you want to do good covers, choose poor songs and reimagine them into something better. Do not cover Tom Petty and then sing like Tom Petty. Do not cover classic Yes (what were you thinking)?		There is just nothing to get excited about here, though I'm really looking forward to their 80s cover album which reportedly will include covers of RELAX, WHO CAN IT BE NOW?, and I RAN (SO FAR AWAY).
1,Back in '08 I purchased this on CD and thought that the recording was saturated by recording with the levels too high.  I recently purchased this on vinyl from here.  I was very excited to play it once I received it, but not so much after I listened to it.  What I wasn't prepared for was that the analog version was actually worse than the CD.  Thankfully, I didn't spend a boatload of money on it and at the time, it was cheaper then it is now.
1,I was really impressed by the song Remember in the movie Troy. So when I saw this dvd/cd with it, I quickly bought it even though what I wanted was the studio recording of Troy. I figured that a live version can't be that bad as Josh has a gorgeous voice. After just one play, I returned it to the store and changed it for something else. Josh sounds really nasal here. Perhaps he had the flu? Then they should have postponed the recording. I cannot sit through this concert without comparing it to the previous which was		excellent. Josh, back to basics please.
1,WHAT IS GOING ON?????????
1,I do not like this mediocre crap that they have produced.  I remember in high school when I was listening to their album "Haunted" when thy made true death metal, not this crap that appeals to those who don't like ultimate irreverent brutality.  The first song I ever heard from them was "Lycanthropy" which was bad ass to begin. I quit listening to them for a while and this is what happens?
1,these tvvats in bush thought that their songs about god knows what with crappy distorted riffs would be the next big thing. america has a bad taste in music from overseas, instead of the happy mondays in '89 they we got jesus jones and instead of the decent music like suede, pulp, blur, verve and oasis we got these knobs running around with crappy rip offs of nirvana riffs. each album firther in their discography is worse and painfully so..this one is utterly unbearable and it makes no sense still how it sold 7 million plus copies. why the hell couldn't america just get into the manic street preachers? they were a great straight ahead rock group...whatevs..i have to say that america made some big mistakes and this band becoming big here was totally one of them...have fun with gwen steffani lead singer of bush...you totally deserve each other if you know what i mean
1,I'm a huge Boston fan but was very disappointed with "Corporate America."  While there are a handful of good "Boston" songs on the album, Tom Scholz seems like he doesn't know which direction to go.  The result is a choppy and un-Boston-like effort.		While the songs "I Had a Good Time" and "Someone" are vintage Boston, the songs "With You" and "Turn It Off" written by newcomers Kim Dahme and Anthony Cosmo (respectively) should never have been on a Boston album.  Rather than going out and picking up a 3rd lead vocalist in Kim Dahme or 3rd lead guitarist in Anthony Cosmo (vocalist Fran Cosmo's son), Scholz would have been better off getting a real drummer!  The drum program that he uses on most of the album is tired, unoriginal, and just plain bad.  I miss the variety a real drummer would provide.  The sound effects (telephones, clocks, sirens, etc.) are also bad and should be lost.		The best songs are those that used the original formula of Scholz and Brad Delp laying down the music.  Scholz definitely needs to lose the extra vocalists and the drum machine!
1,Triple H: N'SYNC should be called XTINKT! Shawn Michaels: You got that right Triple H! Triple H: Is it me or does Justin look like Kenny of The Spirit Squad. Shawn Michaels: Yes and he sounds like him, a wuss who would get beaten up by D-GENERATION X! Triple H: Also, Bye Bye Bye and It's Gonna Be Me are as bad as eating a rotted tuna fish sandwich. Shawn Michaels: Also, Steve Miller should sue these losers and Left Eye's estate for stealing Space Cowboy from him! Triple H: What next, Bratney Sneers calling herself The Gangsteress of Love. Shawn Michaels: We don't have to worry about XTYNCT anymore as they are disbanded, especially after Lance admitted to loving things who had last names like Clark, Cheney, Embersol and Parry. If you are not down with D-X, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells "S*CK IT!")!
1,i was very impressed with their debut album. i thought they had a very promising future. but with this release i have been very disappointed.guess they shot their wad on the first one. sorry guys.
1,Ask me what my favorite band is and I'll answer without hesitation (and have been so saying for the past 15 or so years) "The Cure."  "Disintegration" - one of my top ten favorite albums.  Best concert of any band I've ever seen (I've been to at least a hundred starting from 1975) - The Cure last year at Madison Square Garden, NYC.  But I regret to say that The Cure's music after "Bloodflowers" has been dreadful.  And I don't say this lightly: even writing it is difficult.  But it's the truth, and all of you devoted Cure fans know it.  That doesn't mean I won't keep buying their albums as they release them, though they may be drek like these last two.  But let's not try to pretend anymore: until he can prove differently, Robert Smith, while still a great performer of his old stuff, simply put, hasn't written a really good song since "Bloodflowers," or a truly great one since "Wish."		I'm sorry about the above, because I really love the band.  Robert Smith is easily one of the most influential rock musicians of the last three decades, but not lately.
1,Soundwise, this CD is sadly lacking.  "Everybody Loves a Lover" appears on "Hard to Find Jukebox Classics: 1958 Pop Gold" on the Hit Parade label, and "Teacher's Pet" appears elsewhere, both in true stereo, whereas this CD is all mono (albeit from a rechanneled stereo master tape).  "Secret Love" was mastered from a vinyl record, as scratches are audible throughout.  All tracks have reverb not heard on the original vinyl issues due to Columbia using the electronically rechanneled for stereo master tape and combining it back to mono.  Whoever posted the contents didn't even get them right, as "Teacher's Pet" and "Love Me or Leave Me" were never issued on 78 rpm discs!  The former was issued on a yellow label Columbia 45 and "Love Me or Leave Me" was issued on a 45 rpm EP as part of a 3-EP set.  No 78s for either title.  The collection to get is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Golden-Girl-Columbia-Recordings-1944-1966/dp/B00000J7RW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Golden Girl: Columbia Recordings 1944-1966</a>&nbsp;a two-CD set that offers most of Doris Day's 1950s singles and film favorites, as well as those from the '60s.  "Everybody Loves a Lover" is still mono, but the audio sources are from the original mono and stereo masters and they sound terrific!  Skip this old "Greatest Hits" collection and get a later, remastered release.
1,With the exception of the excellent Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned), the album fails to transcend its origins.  For a while I thought perhaps that track was so good that everything leading up to it was necessary.  I don't think it was.  I had such high hopes for this album after hearing Sleepless on Dark Was The Night.  That song is a masterpiece that stands among the great works of the Decemberists - even better than the great track on this album.  As a whole this album, on the other hand, is surely their least enjoyable (though Her Majesty isn't that great either).  The Decemberists are among my favorites, but once in a while I just don't dig what they're laying out for me.  I want more Crane Wife and Sleepless.  It's not that I don't appreciate the idea - I do.  I just wish the result was a bit more enjoyable to hear.  It's not the weirdness - I do like their cover of Bjork and Morrissey after all.  I enjoy reading the lyrics more than hearing the songs - not a flattering statement I think.
1,Organise a Race of the Three Legged Dogs and I will be there with bells and whistles on. It's the triumph of spirit over mere matter. Reservations on my part arise when three becomes two. I refuse to countenance any event where the poor buggers have a solitary limb to their name - and we won't go beyond that point to ground-zero. Sausage-Dogs in excelsis!		Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martins in the Field have their place in the scheme of things. They served their day. Even so, when they tackle monumental works such as Schubert's Eighth and Ninth Symphonies, thereby inviting comparisons with the likes of Hans Knappertsbusch, well, it's time to evoke one of the races above.		I am thoroughly bored by Schubert's first four symphonies, the latter half of the Fifth and the Sixth in its entirety. Even so, the composer grew in stature as a symphonist. Eight and Nine are masterpieces - and the Tenth Symphony has its moments. Ever so bewilderingly, Sir Neville adopts a `one size fits all' approach to these works. Like others, I cannot hear any differentiation in way of approach between the First Symphony and the Great - and the baseline response is `meek `n' mild' from the onset.		The early digital recording is mundane at best. Listen to the Fifth Symphony. How did it ever pass muster?		Unless you get your cheapies from a low-torque, pedestrian-sounding chamber orchestra, I would avoid this cycle like the pox. Uncle Karl and the Berliners are a much safer bet (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/8-Symphonies/dp/B00005KK4P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">8 Symphonies</a>). Back in 1989, I paid an astronomical sum for this Marriner box in its original livery.  I should have bought a greyhound instead. Who knows: perhaps Malawi Prince, the King of the Dish-Lickers, might have come my way - woof!
1,This is an album I loved on LP back in the Eighties. I bought it with great anticipation, but beware the "Bargain Series" sticker on the front. "Bargain", in this context, appears to mean, "We saved money by not doing any re-mastering and pass the savings on to you!"	This is an AAD disk, which means that the original analog master was simply digitized. A better process is ADD, whereby the analog tracks undergo a final digital mix before the digital master is put on disk. Regardless, there is a noticeable lack of high frequency energy on this CD. It sounds a lot better than the LP does but not nearly as good as it could have. I can't recommend it.
1,would have been a great cd but i could not hear it  all through.
1,Well what a load of .... I thankfully didn't buy this shambles of an album, because I had heard that many people thought it was awful. Having borrowed it from a friend, I can safely say it is worse than awful - it is diabolically bad. Starting off with a grating cut-up Yorke vocal in Everything Is In Its Right Place, imitating the Beatles in National Anthem (except the Beatles knew how to use discordant horns to effect - not irritation), and showing their know how to use play a note perfect G-major scale in Optimistic. Great work guys, you're so innovative and alternative aren't you? The only song that is bearable is How To Disappear Completely and even this Thom sings like he's half asleep. Musically this album is a dead duck, lyrically Thom rattles off meaningless lyrics - although many fanatics are sure to point to glimpses of absent genius amongst his drivel. The other reviewers only rate this album because it is a Radiohead album. If this album came from a 'no-name' group from Iceland, no-one would even listen to it twice.
1,Thought I was getting the CD but ordered the DVD instead.  Anyone want it?  Can be had cheap---(217) 425-7052.
1,this cd is just laziest and none caring from a formerly talented band everything on this cd is really sad but the only redeeming song is FUEL and they can't ruin that even with the symphony, It still rules and kick a*s. fuel and I disappear should have been a 2 song single! that it forget the load / reload cds total bull sh*t but FUEL!!
1,Ok, I heard all soundtracks of all Bond movies ever filmed and until the time I heard this disc for the first time, I thought that no soundtrack could be worse than "Licence to Kill" by Michael Kamen. Man, was I wrong!	Ok, basically, I have nothing against "modern" Bond scores as long as they are on the same level as Tomorrow never dies, but I think that this soundtrack finally marks the end of the era of the good old days.	Well, what's wrong with this soundtrack? First of all, this is supposed to be BOND music, so where are the bare essentials? There is no gunbarrell music, the Bond Theme that can be heard in the End Credits is missing and there are only two tracks out of 19 that contain portions of the original Bond Theme. Now, what else do you expect from a 007 soundtrack? Of course, an original love theme. There have been great love themes in some Bond movies. Which Bond- fan does not remember "We have all the time in the world" or "Bond meets Stacey"? Sadly, here you don't have a real love theme at all. When listening to this CD, you somehow have the feeling like every track is different from the others, which is really bad because you think that you're not listening to a complete soundtrack. The title song by Garbage (there couldn't have been a more fitting name) and also the Bonus Track by Scott Walker are also very out of place because not a single track on the entire soundtrack picks up even one of those two songs again.	All in all, I was very dissapointed. I wonder what Mr Arnold is going to do with "Die Another Day"...
1,Coffinberry's CD EP, entitled "From Now On Now" is quite simply, the worst record I've heard this year.		Granted, it's only mid-January - there's a good chance some other band will top these Ohio based rockers in flatness and unoriginality.  The seven-track album features a mix of blues, feedback, and straight up rock, but the poor production and throaty vocals of Nicholas and Anthony Cross makes Coffinberry sound like just another garage band.  The extended instrumental jams are the musical equivalent of a speaker stringing one clich after another.  But in their defense, "From Now On Now" is Coffinberry's debut album, and judging by online forums, the group's Cleveland-area fans seem to appreciate their live shows.  Then again, used copies of this album are selling for exactly one penny (plus shipping).  You can make your own inference.		The record is distributed by Morphius Records.

1,Call me crazy, but when is an artist in our lifetime going to write something of substance?  Not since Creed's last masterpiece in 1997 or so have we heard any music that matters.  This one from Bob Dylan doesn't reverse the trend of sappy pop and meaningless lyrics that infiltrate the radio waves.  Some of Dylan's acoustic work is good, and I give him props for his work at the controls, but where is the heart, where is the soul?  Where is the topnotch singing?  This guy sounds crusty and somewhat feeble.		Now, if you're looking for good rock, check out Bush 'n' Creed.  Those are bands that make Dylan look like a washed-up geek.  Speaking of geeks, does anyone know when Coldplay's fourth album will hit stores?		KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK...AND KEEP CHECKIN' MY SITE!!		LATER!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This set has it all: rushed tempos, poor recorded sound and no sense whatsoever of grandeur, pathos or humanity.		No wonder the HIPsters love it.		Really, REALLY awful stuff.		Makes Rattle's terrible EMI cycle seem almost bearable in comparison. Almost.
1,I'm not a BIG fan of Marilyn Manson, but I do enjoy his music. I even have a very rare CD from their MM & The Spooky Kids days called The Birth of the Anti-Christ. A couple of my friends were raving about the new album, so I listened to it once. I didn't hear what was so great about it. Surely, I wasn't hearing the same new awesome return to form album they were. I gave it another listen, and just found it so dreadfully boring. I don't know what everyone is hearing when they say Marilyn Manson is back to his old style. There wasn't a song on here I liked. Even on the past 2 albums there were a couple of songs I liked, and I generally find those albums boring too. Now, I'm sure some of the hardcore fans are going to get their panties in a bunch, but that's my opinion on this album. I don't say this to bash Marilyn Manson himself, as I know he is capable of much more than this (or maybe he really is washed up?).
1,i listen to Freiburger Barockorchester version at work and it sounds natural and clean; this version seems stiff and forced.
1,There isn't one song on here as good as Groove Holmes; can't believe I paid $13 for this.  I like the Beasties as much as the next middle-aged ex-new waver but this is disappointing.  No, it's lame.  We'll always have Paul's Boutique and I still think they are three talented and funny guys but The Mix-up, no.  Should have been a free e.p. or something...
1,Couple of good songs
1,It's too late for some people. This girl doesn't need your money anymore. She's sold out to Pro-Activ makeup to cover her blemishes. Too bad no amount of creme is going to cover up her total lack of talent. Message to the world: try listening to an album without watching the video first, you might not really like her music that much.		Oh, one more thing: why in the world does she braid her hair in such irratic cornrows? You'd think she'd figure out how to cut a straight hedge. Oops, I forgot, she's more worried about her acne!!
1,As a lifelong fan of Babs' acting, musical wok, and meat-factory management guide writing, I found this dissapointing. There's a fine line between verbose Machiavellian posturing and the crushed souls of the weak that infest our society, and Barbra Streisand is that line.
1,I like his old songs.
1,Dexterity is pointless without good writing. I can't find anything on this cd that is from the heart or well thought out. I've been hanging in there w/ the last 2 cds, but DT really needs a writer and a producer. I don't want images + awake pt2, but I do want the same amount of heart, passion and well thought out lyrics and melodies. They could do an acoustic albulm or an acapella cd, but no matter what style, it has to have Well thought out melodies. Singers don't write well thought out melodies. Writers who understand what notes fit over chords do that. Instrumental sections should also be well thought out. Not just random pastings. Get Kevin back + hire a producer.  Untill then, Rudess is just going noodle elp + various other influences from his past.  Rudess needs music on paper. He can read....not necessarilly write. Also what's up w/ being influenced by the younger generation. Since  Kevin left, they have been copying everyone from u2 to tool + muse.
1,i used to like [...] until he had beef with chamillion and chamillion just wrecked him. and this new cd super sucks man he is not a good solo rapper as you can see his only good songs are with other ppl this is so dumb and a waste of my money	 like he has this one song  that is a copy of eminems-my name is and he is like	"hi my name is what?,my name is who? my name is MIKE JONES"	how dumb is that	dyke jones
1,This is nothing compared to their second release! the music itself isn't atcually that different from we are not alone, which is somewhat disappointing, because it shows that they haven't really gone anywhere musically with their second album, but also because i thought this would be a lot heavier than it is (read my review of we are not alone). The real low point of this album is the mixing. The drums sound awful! They're almost muted to a point where you have to turn the music up to hear them properly, which then distorts the bass to uncomforatable levels. The one good thing about this album is that it shows how much techincal improvement has gone into we are not alone, if not musical improvement. The guitarists have definately got better at what they do with we are not alone. I'm sorry I really don't have much to say apart from that this is disappointing for me. If you like this album and haven't got we are not alone go and get it immediately and soon you will wonder how you could ever like this album. If you don't like this album that much, I do recommend we are not alone because it is such an improvement. If you're looking for good solid rock, look to their second release again. If you're into the heavier side or the "nu" side of metal look elsewhere, maybe to Mushroomhead, Disturbed or Mudvayne. But i can't really say anything else except to skip this album and buy we are not alone instead. You will get a lot more enjoyment and value for money from it, trust me.		Best (coff!) Songs:		Wish I May 6/10		Medicate 5/10		Polyamourus (or however you spell it) 4/10
1,badly damaged. Just put it disc one in my CD player for the first time since its arrival and it breaks up badly. It does not appear to be scratched but is obviously defective. It was cheap. I hope that is not the reason it is such a bad copy.
1,I just opened the box set and have not yet listened to any of the discs.  But I'm terribly annoyed that the cover of the box is not the real Charlie Parker picture as displayed - it is Forest Whitaker.  I purchased this box because of very good reviews, so I'm assuming once I listen to the music, I will not be disappointed.
1,At The Drive In was a band that was poised for greatness, yet they imploded before they were able to go that far.  They splintered off into a few projects, most notably Sparta and The Mars Volta.  While the former band scales back the ATDI sound and tones down the eccentricities, Mars Volta is all over the place - nothing is too pretentious, too extreme, too over the top for these guys.  Some will find the grandiosity of this album to be somewhat off-putting, as did I.  The reasons (given by Omar Rodriguez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala) that led to the demise of ATDI don't seem to hold much water - they were quoted as saying something to the effect of "ATDI appealed to testosterone-driven men and we didn't want to be a part of that scene".  Both bands are good, but unfortunately clearly are the sum of their parts.	Whether you like this album or not will depend squarely on how you feel about prog-rock.  I think that this genre, in skilled hands and executed properly, can be quite engaging (i.e. Tool).  But this album has a "throw it to the wall and see if it sticks" feel to it - the ambitions are good-intentioned but the band just doesn't have the determination or the continuity to make it work in the finished product: their reach exceeds their grasp.  I think that if the band wasn't too willing to let the past go and if they incorporated more of their previous band's angst and aggression, and if they spent more time recording this album, it could have been a more consistent and rewarding listen.  But that was not to be.	In summary: Not a bad album, but by no means worthy of all the praise that has been foisted upon it.  This album only shows potential of what the band is capable of.  It also makes you mourn the loss of ATDI knowing that they definitely were capable of putting out a masterpiece.
1,I'm sorry, I really hate to bash Uncle Al, but...  what is this??  Honestly, for those still following along, this sounds like rejected demos from the last 3 Ministry albums.  The production is dreadful.  It sounds like it was recorded on someone's home computer.  This is so far from any other RevCo album, I just don't know what to say...  very, very disappointing.  No throbbing bass riffs, pounding drums, evil grooves...  nothing even remotely memorable, interesting, or kick-a$$.
1,I was warned to only buy Bolan's albums produced by Tony Visconti.  Heed my warning:  follow this advice!  Bolan always wrote very spaced out, nonsensical lyrics.  They only got worse as his career progressed!  These songs are very mediocre - Bolan didn't evolve as an artist - he regressed!  I'm going to listen to Zinc Alloy (the last Visconti produced record) and the very first two Bolan/Rex albums with Mr. Took and then stop.  I love the first 4 T. Rex CD's and Beard of Stars.  This awful teenybopper pop album is getting recycled at the used CD store!
1,dogz homiez g'z, dis not be da hizzly foshizzly on zwollow thiz jizzle! Lemme kik it freestyle foyas..yo i be rappn, don't crackalakin, or da g will get the flaka a kack a mack yo's! HOmiez!

1,I've read reviews saying how muffled other remasterings were. Do you folks not remember how the stuff sounded on vinyl. It had punch and power. That's the sound of rock music. It's not muffled. Turn it up and it comes alive. The '97 remasters deliver some of that. Fly By Night is representative of that. Exist Stage Left...also. Of the later releases Counter Parts and Test for Echo get it done. Signals is one of my favs also, but with the '97 remaster I had to do a remaster of my own with my CD recorder and my 7 band EQ to add some punch and power. Did that with 2112, Moving Picture and Grace Under Pressure. Now those shake the room like Fly By Night does. You get the point. This stuff about crisp, clean and clear has ruined countless remaster over the years. Sadly the Sector Sets are also a victim of the crisp and clear crap. Love the idea though. But don't leave out the punch and power!
1,I'm sure the music is very good, but any man who would marry his YOUNG adopted daughter and also have other pedophilic allegations against him doesn't deserve my $.
1,Yet another attrocious remastering. This sounds compressed and dull, no depth. Just as the Friay Music release of Relayer sounded muddy and compressed.	My original records of both sound better that the Friday Music vinyl.	Don't waste your money.
1,good CD by the remitter
1,It's amusing to listen to all the idiot mallcore kids, wearing their Slipknot sweatshirts and stained cargo pants, going on about how ground-breaking this album is.  I have news for you: this is the same s**t Disturbed has always done!  The only thing different is on this album the guitarist took a couple of extra music lessons and played a few solos, which aren't even that good.		I don't mind so much if you like this album but at least come up with a f**king good reason for it!  "Wow, this is so intense!  Yeah, Disturbed really pushed the boundaries of music here and have evolved!"  Bulls**t.  I saw one idiot here even argue that they weren't nu metal.		Anyway:		Vocals/lyrics: At least on their first album they could make some amusing songs about violence and stuff, with funny nonsensical noises like "Ooh-wah-ah-ah-ah!" and "SAW!"  They do nothing here except brag about how gay they are.  Vocalist sounds like he's constipated.		Guitar: Repetitive riffs, all power chords, weak solos.  A step up with the solos but still very poor.		Bass: What bass?  There's a bassist in the band?		Drums: Like all nu metal drummers, slow, boring and simplistic.  They should just get a drum machine so the other 3 members can get a bigger cut of the pay.		Overall: Very nu metally, which is bad.  No real originality and the songs are quite annoying.		My grade: BURN IN HELL, DISTURBED.		Recommendation: Pull your balls back on, chuck the CD blade-side first at the nearest mallcore kid (preferably the non-stoned ones so they react more angrily) and pick up a real metal album such as "Ride The Lightning" by Metallica.		(DISCLAIMER: You can like this CD if you insist but please stop making up such ridiculous lies such as, "This album is ground breaking for Disturbed.")
1,The playing is technically fantastic and the grooves really do roll.	This goes for the playing of all involved here -but what's with some of those keyboard solos...as if the player was looking to break some speed record and had forgotten all about the things that make good solos. The prime example here is the first tune.-COME ON, PLEASE!!!	I find the pieces to be weak at best ( not the grooves and rhythms , just for what end they are being used here). The percieved lack of dynamics is also giving me a bit of a hard time.	I love howard levy's playing but here he is just not given an adequate vehicle to shine. He does help a little tho-and his leaving the flecktones is still something... well a real shame!!!	To me , with his departure, something special left that band which has not been regained.	He's just incredible ( his contributions to donald fagens latest album are another case in point. here he plays extremely well in a real good song..."what I do" has an extended levy solo. To my ears ,perfect within it's conext)	Richard Bona helps a little as well ...he is the one thing I like about " I saw god" a fantastically repetative and preachy cheesefest of a song.	Thanks very much tho for "song for my father" , this horace silver tune helps a little as one has heard it so many times , covered by everyone but the neighbors' cat. It's a classic for a reason. The inthusiasm about this horace silver tune lasts at least until one has actually heard the version on this album.		I really like "what did he say" tho. A previous wooten album.	That one is to me a very interesting , extremely well played , humorous and musical album. At least for the most part.	I would recommend that album any day when compared with palmystery.
1,Not a good recording of this opera at all. Voight is over-parted in this as in many other German roles. She is best with La Fanciulla del West, but even here she relies on perfunctory acting techniques and lets the voice lower to ebetually shave off the high notes.		In this magnificent opera, high notes saturate the score, beautifully matching a star singer's technique, style, and range. Voight has none of this; she balks all the VIP issues in the score and we get as a result a flat sounding Helena, almost amateur sounding, like a five finger excercise. It is unpleasant to hear her declaim things, and when she scoops up to the top it's irritating. She lacks volume as well. This is a LOUD opera and one must have the vocal stamina, as G. Jones does on  DECCA. Voight does not have the big voice. Remember Voight in Les Troyens last year at the Met? Crushing criticism, and she needs to hear it and get into mezzo roles that make her squawk less.		The DECCA recording of the late 70s has all that this recording lacks, Gwyneth Jones, with her elegance, range, her syrocket high notes,her enunciation, and breathtaking tessitura,the latter of  which is the heart of mastering this long piece. Buy this one and forget Voight et al. Also, this DECCA recording was done in the studio, conducted by the great Donyani..in Detroit, MI no less!		Enjoy this recording and experience the thrill of the true soprano sound.. I know Strauss was a Nazi; he supervised all music under Hitler. Maybe that is why this opera may be his best; he composed it without the searching eyes of the gestapo.
1,I suppose I don't really "get" Cat Power, which is surprising most of all to me, having been a huge fan of Velocity Girl, Eve's Plum, Liz Phair, and many other alt-prog chick rockers.  With Cat Power, though, I just feel like Ms. Marshall has a beautiful voice with nowhere to go.  The lyrics in these songs are shallow and wanderlust, the music droning and dull, and the entire album is utterly and completely forgetable.		I won't deny that Cat Power has a large and rabid following (indeed, I thoroughly expect this review to be flamed by said legion), however I just think there are better indie-rock choices on the market for my $14, and I really can't recommend this one.
1,I hate rap and pop music, and much of the other stuff is too mellow for me. But I do enjoy the Cult's song, and I am a pretty big Ozzy fan as well. But the song that really makes this album shine is closing number "Light Comes Out Of Black" by the metalgod himself, Rob Halford. The song is very reminiscent of Priest in their Painkiller era. Overall, get this, burn the Halford song onto a CD, then sell it.
1,It's nice that Sum 41 is adding a bit of metal flavor into their sound and all, but do they need to resort to outright rip-offs of other bands? I mean, the oh-so-clever reference to "Master of Puppets" in the acoustic intro would have been acceptable had they not completely stolen the chorus and chord progressions from the classic "Battery" from the same album on "The Bitter End". That's really about as close as you can get to copying a song without getting sued. The ending might as well be note-for-note.		Sorry, but I'm not paying to listen to recycled music.
1,I like jake e lee-s work but this is underproduced*/disapointed
1,I enjoyed the album Gimme Some enough to check out these guys beginnings.  I found only five songs that I like.  It Don't Move Me and I Want You the songs I like best.  I can't say buy this unless you find one at a good price as I did.
1,back ground music drowns out vocal. First Il volo I will not buy
1,I WAS LISTENING TO THIS AND AIT REMINDED ME OF SONIC YOUTH WHO THEY OBVIOUSLY STOLE EVERY CHUIMPANZEE OUT OF.	THIS WAS NOT THAT WHICH WASN'T OR COMPLETELY WHAT DID YOU CALL MY MOTHER FORGET FORTUNES JJFC
1,This is about as far off from punk rock as you can get.  Around this time, the Clash adopted the moniker: "The only band that matters."  When they started out, they became wildly popular among disaffected young men and women for scabrous anthems like, "Garageland" and "White Riot."  Their songs, in classic punk style, were short and to the point.  Sandinista, released three years after their debut, is a sprawling, grandiose statement to all music fans: "We are the only band that matters."		There were already hints that the Clash's popularity was going to their heads.  Their initial title for London Calling was to be The New Testament.  Punk was about taking down the sell-out acts who packed the stadiums.  With London Calling's success, the Clash DID pack the stadiums.  They didn't remain humble.  It is near-second hand news that there is one great album buried in this mess.  I disagree.  The only fun you're going to have listening to Sandinista are the songs Washington Bullets and the Street Parade.  Other than that, you will have to wade through disco, mediocre dub attempts, "Revolution 9"-style pretentiousness (nearly unthinkable from this band a few years earlier), and all other manner of affectation.		They were just making an album.  The Clash must have thought they were introducing a bill into the American justice system or some endeavor of  comparable importance.  Did they really think a bunch of social activists would be squatting by their record players, trying to make out every word of the Magnficent Seven? I think the Clash forgot what their role was as a band.  Some of you may think that they, as a band, have only one allegiance: THEMSELVES.  Because they are the artists, they can do whatever they want and we're all supposed to think it's great if we liked their last album.  I disagree with those people.  I think a band, such as the Clash, has its greatest allegiance to its FANS, who made the band what it is.  To me, the inclusion of the seven or eight "experimental" songs at the end of this album is a big F*** YOU to anyone listening.  It was either filler to make it all a triple album or those sorry Brits actually believed they were making great art and we devoted fans deserved to hear whatever crappy ideas they had. Less is more, a wise man once said.  Thankfully the Clash recovered from this stumble with their next album (in my opinion) which is political, social and fun to listen to.		Sandinista, while powerful, is the sloppy, self-important equivalent of that "cool" lecturer from college, drunk off his ass, reading from his novel, which nonetheless contains some brilliant passages, but goes on and on, completely misguided, out of tune, out of step with anything the students want to hear, until he's spent, sober, and bloody well done.
1,I was working at a record store when this album came out (back when they had record stores) and was forced to listen to this on our PA system on a daily basis. Musically lacking any ambition, chock full of really simple-minded, self-righteous lyrics, and about as interesting as a ten-pound bag of fertilizer.
1,I have digested enough Van through the years to know good from bad. This one just does not measure up to his abilities. I've tried to give this repeated chances and it keeps coming up short to even his 'below average' efforts. YMMV
1,...and this is NOT GOOD MUSIC! I gave this album a chance really, I enjoyed 'de-loused' and even 'frances' but this album is completely unnecessary.		I know this band has talent - I am not denying that, but it is like the guys must think they have more talent than they actually do. They must think that adding several minutes of annoying sounds to a song that probably should have been around 3 or 4 minutes long somehow qualifies them as a progressive rock band or something.		There is a difference between popular music that appeals to the masses and then good musicianship. The problem is they threw out the later in order to avoid the former - and that is undesirable to a music fan such as myself.		One of the main problems with this album is the vocals - I have never been hugely enthusiastic about their singing style anyways, but some parts of 'Amputechture' can become unbearable.		There are some good parts on this album, but nothing that justifies spending money on it - I wish I hadn't.		RECOMMENDATION: If you are a fan of REAL progressive rock (or interested in what it is) then I HIGHLY recommend checking out any album by a band called Pain Of Salvation. They are simply AMAZING! A good place to start would be the album 'Remedy Lane'. After hearing it you will probably never listen to 'Amputechture' again...
1,No disc can sound as good as vinyl. That's understood. What is totally unacceptable is the editing. Perhaps we do not need to hear all the applause between songs but to edit with complete "pops" inside the song it's self in multiple songs let alone one is totally unacceptable.	This is one of my favorite albums, do yourself a favor, buy the original vinyl in at least 180 gram pressing. It deserves it!
1,AFTER ALL THE LYRIC'S ABOUT MONEY,THE ESTABLISHMENT,THE STATE OF THE WORLD,PINK FLOYD AND THEIR HANDLER'S PUT OUT THIS "RIP OFF" THAT OFFERS NOTHING SPECIAL EXCEPT A HEFTY PRICE TAG!!!!WHY??? I ALONG WITH OTHER FLOYD FANS HAVE PAID FOR YOUR ALBUMS AND THEN C D'S....THE BOX SET "SHINE" WAS ANOTHER WALLET WEAROUT AND NOW THIS!!!!I WILL STICK TO MY COLLECTION AND DO YOURSELF A FAVOR "SAVE YOUR MONEY SAFELY BEHIND ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL"....
1,When Gravity Kills' first album came out, I was all over it.  I played it on my radio show, and I also played it at home.  It is a good example of industrial rock, and if the lyrics were a bit silly, the music was good enough, and new enough, that I could let it slide.  Gravity Kills' first album was part of the initial onslaught of industrial rock, and the singles were gobbled up by the Hollywood machine for use in soundtracks.	Superstarved is more of the same.  The result is a recycled morass.  In the years that have passed since their last album, I'd have thought there would be some sort of growth, but what I hear instead is entropy.  I would not be surprised if Gravity Kills continues to be used in movie soundtracks.  They have that "edgy, angry, raw sound" that works perfectly in action movies or scenes where the protagonist is harbouring thoughts of jealous rage.	However, the music is no longer fresh, and what was once really cool has become generic.  And now, I can no longer let the silly, shallow lyrics slide.  "Forget Your Name" is probably the worst of the bunch, with lines like "Well I forget your name, but I love you.  I forget your name, but I need you, too.  I forget your name, I know you're feeling the same, I forget your name, but I want you, want you."	This Shatneresque repetition of simple phrases is used throughout the album.  In "Enemy," I hear "I don't want to be your enemy.  Never gonna be never gonna be your enemy.  I don't want to be your enemy."	The icing on the cake is "15 Minutes".  The hollering goes thusly:  "I want my 15 minutes of shame.  I want my 15 minutes, my 15 minutes of shame."	You got it, guys.
1,Ordered the vinyl. It is just a single, not the full album.
1,One of the great mysteries in life has to be why metal scribe Martin Popoff ('The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal') dismisses Bathory's first four albums (including...'Blood Fire Death') as "vacuum-cleaner-with-drums ...metal" and loves First, the production and mix: the worst of any Bathory album, including 'Requiem'; thin guitars andnoisy biscuit-tin drums that are borderline unlistenable...it almost strikes me that Quorthon is trying to artificially recreate the garage feel of the Heavenshore days, but he forgot to include the chainsaw on steroids and the vomit vocals. And speaking of vocals...yeesh. Utterly tuneless shouting and without either the sickness or the vitriol he's known for. The songs: like leftovers from 'Requiem' with ridiculous social commentary ("Century" is utterly insipid) or lyrics that are just over-the-top disgusting ("33 Something", which describes John Wayne Gacy's sex murders in repulsively explicit detail). Did Quorthon REALLY want this album to come out this way?	'Octagon' is so bad that it has actually discouraged me from plopping down my (cash)to check out 'Destroyer of Worlds', and anyone who questions my devotion to this band is advised to check out my other reviews. I heartily encourage any young black metal devotee who hasn't heard a Bathory album before to check 'em out...but avoid this one like the plague.
1,wow, great cd, the drums suck, the guitar sux, and the singer is such a fag.  this cd should burn under the flame of my fart!! punk sucks a**. what a bunch of f*****g posers.  kill all these retards!!! yippeeeeeee!!!! if ya wanna listen to some good music try listening to cradle of filth, or in flames, im me at mysticyautja if you wish
1,When I first heard the song You Get What You Give, I thought it was such a powerful, and attention-grabbing song. I wanted to know all about the band,  and the album. I got the album for Christmas of 98, and I must say that I  was very disappointed with it. Despite the fact that You Get What You Give  is a great song, the rest of the album sounds nothing like that one.  They're not as upbeat, and they sound like a completely different genre  than its popular track. My advice: save your money for a better CD.
1,Makaila may have a great voice, actually she has a great voice, but she should use it for some better music. The lyrics to this song are catchy, but it's just too much for a 14 year old girl to handle. Brooke Allison is better but not great. Maybe Makaila will mature, but her single & album didn't sell good at all & didn't concure a good number at all on the Billboard charts. So that should tell you not to waste two bucks on this single when you could buy a much better 2 buck single. The single is colorful and cool, but the music is too cheesy & young for me. We've all heard the 'I'm in love with you' stuff enough. It's alright, but it sucks coming from this girl.
1,I was compelled to write a review, in order to disagree with all these 5 star ratings and provide a different opinion. I apologise for the very low rating, but I truly feel extremely disappointed with this album.		I have been following Within Temptation from their excellent "Mother Earth" release. The band always had this unique symphonic rock/metal touch in their music and Sharon den Adel's amazingly beautiful and crystal clear vocals.		On this new release the band choose to throw away their sound and their unique approach to vocals as well. The best way to describe the music on the album is mainstream pop-rock bordering on glam-rock. I seriously got the feeling that I was listening to a rockier version of Avril Lavigne (no joke). Most songs sound the same, the songwriting is uninspired, there are electro elements scattered around and surprisingly most of the vocals sound like your above average pop-rock female singer. There are some catchy moments and some good guitar riffs at parts, but this is overall a very safe and radio friendly album which fully justifies the 'sell-out' accusations.		The only noteworthy tracks are "Shot In The Dark" and the single "Faster". The first is a mid tempo ballad like song, while "Faster" is a mid to slow tempo pop-rock track. Even though these 2 are the standout songs, they pale in comparison to older fan favourites like 'Stand My Ground' and 'Ice Queen'.		The band's previous release "The Heart Of Everything" was also a step down, when compared to their masterpieces "Mother Earth" and "The Silent Force", but it still contained some very good songs, amazing vocals and preserved the band's sound/identity. This album is just disappointing from all perspectives. A shame...Buyer be ware!
1,First off I am rating the quality of the set here.  We already know the Beatles are 5 star all the way.	These albums are cut from 24 bit low rate sampled masters and do not have the superior stereo image of the original fully analog pressings.  Recommend just getting the CDs instead.  The sound character of the albums is what I would call neutral with balanced frequency response.  On some material Bass particularly is more realistic. The new mastering is similar to the CD Box set though with less compression  and I like it. So that part is good.  I agree that the overall sound is good when compared to other vinyl that comes from low sample rate digital masters but it could have been so much better. The bad thing is that on a good stereo system these pressings do not sound as good stereo image wise as what fully analog Beatles pressings do.  NOWHERE near it.  The image is flat with no spatial characteristics whatsoever.  On a cymbal the effects are especially pronounced. That is to be expected from digital 24 bit/44.1 Khz sampled material.  The WOW factor is just not there.  There is NO way these are from 192/24 masters and Abbey admits it.	Mobile Fidelity vinyl sourced from analog masters BLOWS them away with superior stereo image and Mobile Fidelity is not known as the best sound quality vinyl out there for the Beatles.	The inexperienced listener who has never heard real sound and has a cheap stereo may not notice it though and may be happy.  That person would still be better off with CDs though.		The package itself is beautiful though and looks wonderful to my eye.  I love the book. The reason for buying vinyl in the first place is to get the benefits of 100% all analog sound.  These don't provide it.  It is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into this.  But it was wasted because of a fundamental technical error in using a low sample rate digital master.  If not analog they could have at least used a 192/24 bit and things would have been all right.  If you are a digital person do not bother wasting the money on high maintenance vinyl.  The 2009 CD box set is cheaper and provides better value.
1,Yet again we are treated to another incomplete collection of greatest Maiden hits with the most essential pieces cut from the cloth.  For starters, Paul Di'anno, original Iron Maiden frontman.  Ever hear of an album called Iron Maiden?  Killers?  Ring a bell?  We miss out on such classic Maiden standards as "Running Free" & "Iron Maiden" & "Sanctuary" as well as shredders like "Phantom Of The Opera", "Purgatory", "Wrathchild" & "Killers."  Sorry to say, but some of their best, most honest stuff was with Di'anno. "Murders In The Rue Morgue"  "Drifter"  "Innocent Exile"  Anyone??? Get a grip people!  Then we move on to Bruce Dickenson-era Maiden and still we fall short.  Less emphasis on the earlier albums, they completely cut out inspired works like "Children Of The Damned", "Hallowed Be Thy Name","22 Acacia Avenue", "Revelations", "Die With Your Boots On", "Gangland"  and even the Magnum Opus "Rime Of The Ancient Mariner."  As to be expected from a single-CD Best Of.. collection, we can see right through it.  And why the f**k is Blaze Bayley on this CD at all?  Can we get the novocaine and pull that rotten tooth from the body that is Iron Maiden.  Mistakes have been made in the past (i.e. the induction of "Bring Your Daughter..." to any Maiden compilation.)  I have my own compilations of Maiden - Maiden Heaven & Maiden Hell, and I can assure everyone out there that they blow this Edward The Great rehashed bullsh*t away!  No Maiden fan needs to own this disc.  It's completely pointless...  Can anyone tell me why Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son would have four songs on any disc where Powerslave has only one and Piece Of Mind and Number Of The Beast get two appiece?  Has someone, like Eddie, lost their mind?
1,If you think this CD is a pathetic self-parody and you'd rather listen to good stuff like Public Enemy and NWA instead of this POS hit "yes".		If you think Chingy rules the world and PE and NWA are posers hit "no".		Lets see how this little experiment goes on....
1,Okay: New producer, new engineer and new studio. You have to admire the lady for going in a different direction. I found the changes to be appalling. The sound is steely and sharp (typical of T-bone Burnett) and at times the instrumentation overrides the vocal. I listened to it three times, trying to like it. I failed. A major disappointment on all counts. I believe this comes under the category of "it seemed like a good idea at the time". In retrospect it was not.
1,great music
1,Bust A Move was the only good song on this album.  The other songs were just sitting on this album and doing nothing while I listened to this album.  This is basically a one-hit rapper from the 80's and this album is  the same. The other songs aren't nearly as catchy as Bust A Move is.
1,the recviews already posted for this band are NOT for this CD.  This CD is absolutely HORRIBLE.!  Whoever the lead singer is cannot sing.  The band is okay but vocals are TERRIBLE.  Amazon.com needs to put the reviews in the right place for the proper CD.		This is absurdist music for an unidentifable audience.  This album DOES NOT have Cass or Denny in it!  BEWARE!
1,Plays out like a third rate Bungle/Secret Chiefs throwaway disc, at times a downright literal one. Too many types of undereducated spazz lead to nothing but unintentional awkward pity. But yes, there is enough derivative freakout spunk for meriting at least one headphone excursion for the rare moments they aren't solely intent on masturbatory microphonics.
1,A HORRIBLE FOLLOW UP ALBUM TO UPSTAIRS AT ERICS. ONLY 2 SONGS - NOBODYS DIARY AND STATE FARM ARE EVEN WORTH LISTENING TOO.
1,I rec it today, only about 3 songs were any good. Thank goodness I didn't pay more...I am still going to get het cabaret.
1,meh. i am not sure what is up with folks these days. if a band does something slightly unexpected--even if it's crazy trite--people think it's genius.		i love the first few baroness eps, but then they turned into a pretty 1:1 mastodon clone. sometimes that was ok; they clearly have huge musical prowess...but everything smacks of trying too hard. a lot of the joy of good song craftsmanship was lost to an overriding, heavy-handed approach at trying really, really hard to be "technically complex."		this album gave me hope again. because, the hooks. man, i love hooks. you can be poppy, just write great songs and wormy hooks. hooks in heavy music steal whatever that mass is where my heart should be.		the first few times i heard "take my bones away" and "eula," it got all earwormy. and i got excited.		i went on a long vacation and had some good downtime to really focus on the whole album. in total, this is more offputting than listenable. again, there's such an over-reach of effort to "be" something that they really organically are not.		the hooks are shallow and as i said, trite. they are taking hooks and melodies we've heard a billion times in non-metal and repackaging them around baroness-y ancillary elements. some songs are straight up rip offs (28 days later theme). the lyrics are...man. they are just stupid a lot of the time. "settle down, this won't last long" is the coolest thing he says--but it's in a song titled--what?--Eula.	huh.		and that one other song is a very VERY thinly veiled "hide yo' kids, hide yo' wife."		again, this is more trying too hard to be something they naturally arent--in this case, deep or meaningful in lyrics.		anyway. sorry. it was hooky for like a second, and i was fired up...but the whole thing reeks of gimmick. beyond that, after the initial earwormery, all desire to re-listen to it is lost. count me out.
1,IT WAS WACK AND IT DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH TIGHT LYRICS AND IT HAD TO MANY PEOPLE ON THE CD.
1,The Curmudgeon never has been, nor ever will be, what you would call a major Michael Jackson fan but there really is no denying that, before the baby dangling and kiddie fiddling antics and the frightening plastic surgery and, well, everything else that turned him into an off-putting laughing stock, before all that - Michael Jackson was quite simply one of the greatest pop stars on the planet. Innovative, exciting, mysterious - basically everything that absolutely NO pop star is nowadays. Jackson really did seem like he came from some fantastic alternative universe, creating some jaw dropping, magnificent pop records - Thriller being one of them.		So it comes as absolutely no shock that one of the all-time essential albums gets a 25th anniversary edition. Quite as to WHY we really need another edition, when you consider that it was re-released as a Special Edition a few years back, not to mention the fact that every single was re-released only last year - really Mike, how much longer do you expect your glassy-eyed, weirdo obsessive fans to buy the same music time and time again?		Anyway, you're probably wondering WHY Thriller, one of the greatest albums of all time, from one of the greatest pop stars of all time, is sitting alongside the very worst Amazon has to offer in the Curmudgeon's reviews?		Because, not only is it a cheap cash in, not only is it unwarranted, not only is it MISSING actual album tracks from the previous Special Edition, but because the main selling point here isn't Thriller itself - more the "previously un-released" (read - knocked up about a week ago) bonus tracks, featuring remixes and covers from such luminaries as Will. I.Am and Fergie.		Are you scared yet?		Gentle reader, you SHOULD be. For tacked on at the end of the album are 5 horrific, worthless, pointless remixes that clearly anyone could and should do without. Did you ever want to hear Dead Eyed Peas "singer" Fergie strain through "Beat It?" Not in a million years, obviously - but you can now! Did you ache to hear a new version of Wanna Be Starting Somethin', but this time with Akon and Will. I.Am? Only if suicide swiftly followed, surely - but it's on here too.		People like Akon and Fergie don't even deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as someone like Michael Jackson, yet here they are stinking up a classic album, an album that some poor kid is going to think is the REAL Thriller record. It's like Bob Dylan re-releasing Blonde On Blonde but with Fred Durst on vocals.		An abomination, then. By all means add Thriller to your record collection. In no way, shape or form make it this version.
1,I don't have any of her albums but ive heard a few of her songs, and they were good stuff. But this record? its like a strickly religous person denouncing their faith and turning into the complete opposite. This record sounds way too britney spears-like. if your doing good with a particular genre, STICK WITH IT, and don't change for no one just to raise your ego cause then you start losing fans big time!
1,Hearing the songs on this album made me want to stick hot pokers in my ears just to end the pain.
1,This album is by far their worst album. Its not rap / metal is just rap and some times rap /metal. Stay on their previous albums and especially Born dead and Violent Demise.
1,Wow, the boys of Coldplay sure have fallen from such great heights. These Irish rockers who once mesmerized audiences worldwide with deep and philosophical songs such as "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" are now meandering through such rubbish as "Lost!" (exclamation point part of the song title) and "Lovers in Japan" which is an ode to lead singer Pear Martin's Japanese wife: Kate Hudson. While this is a tender moment, the rest of the album is low point after low point, completely lacking in what other releases, such as "Ten Summoner's Tales" and "White Ladder" had in abundance: artistic vision.		Martin's guitar work on this album is sub par compared to previous records, and his deep growling voice is sounding a bit aged as the years go by. While I applaud Coldplay for their humanitarian work around the world, for not letting fame go to their heads, and bringing pride to those in Ireland, this album should have been left unrecorded. Butter luck next time, Coldplay!
1,This is yet another triumph of marketing--as far as the actual MUSICAL CONTENT of this album is concerned, there is barely anything to speak of that even vaguely approaches QUALITY.  The album seems badly made from a very fundamental point of view, with awkward transitions as if the producers can't even figure out how to maintain any kind of a bare bones groove.  To be perhaps fair, I could forgive Lovato and company for not having completely original chord progressions--this is pop music after all--but they go to the opposite extreme, sticking with the braindead 1-5-6-4 major key sequence, the most boring and overused chord sequence in all of music, on song after song.  The chorus of "Heart Attack" makes a mockery of the soaring Ryan Tedder hook from the Far East Movement song "Rocketeer".  "Made in the U.S.A." doesn't even make coherent sense, but the lyrics to "Heart Attack" are even more inane, and they sound even worse because Lovato oversings EVERYTHING.  Lovato makes it sound like the fate of nations will be determined by whether or not some prospective 'boy toy' gets a whiff of her perfume or not--the effect is unbelievably ridiculous.  "Shouldn't Come Back" is such a phony ballad it's downright nauseating.		For a truly rewarding contemporary listen, check out&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Do-Not-Rebuy-Your-Old-Favorites-yet-Again-Explicit/dp/B00LW5AZ7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Do Not Rebuy Your Old Favorites yet Again [Explicit</a>], and steer clear of "Demi".
1,I don't understand the mediocre (and just plain bad) Frank Black albums getting 4 1/2 stars on average either. If you're new to Frank Black, I would recommend you get all the Pixies albums first of course. Then you should get the first two Frank Black albums (self-titled, Teenager of the Year), which are really really good. Other albums of his that have several to mostly quality tracks: Pistolero, Dog in the Sand, Honeycomb, Cult of Ray (yes!), the self-titled Catholics album, and Black Letter Days. The rest don't do anything for me, including this one.
1,Do not buy! You will get ripped off! Missing 3 songs even though packaging states that they are on there! Doesn't the record company have any quality control?!
1,This just seems to be a reissue of M+TM's UK best-of from 1996.  That means that the version of "All I Need Is A Miracle" here is not the original.  When Rhino decided to re-release this, why didn't they include both?  As if that wasn't bad enough, this collection doesn't even have all of the group's Top 100 US hits.  Usually Rhino does a great job off nailing all the charting singles and adding extra tracks, but in this case they really dropped the ball!

1,I was thrilled when I heard that a new Alan Parsons disc was on the way.  It had been 5 years since "The Time Machine" came out, and that was, in my opinion, the best work he'd done since some of the better Alan Parsons Project albums.  So I bought "A Valid Path", popped it in the player, and, ouch!!!!  I'm sorry, but this disc it just doesn't contain the Alan Parsons sound I know and enjoy.		"A Valid Path" is heavy duty electronica through and through.  Granted, APP has always had a strong component of electronica, but in this effort electronica has overwhelmed the music.  Um...it's like going to a movie where it's obvious that the producers were more interested in what they could do with digital effects than with plot development.		If you are a long-time Parsons fan you may not not like this offering.  The only way I really knew it was a Parsons release was that the disc contained some electrocuted (er...re-engineered) tracks from earlier releases: Mammamgamma '04, A Recurring Dream Within a Dream...		If you are looking for traditional APP-style music DO NOT LOOK HERE, Alan Parsons has gone off in a new direction.		OK, with that said, please keep in mind that these comments were made from the perspective of someone looking for more Alan Parsons music after the manner of APP.  Since that was the case, I was hit with a double whammy - not APP style music, and a heavy dose of, at least to me, uninspired electronica overkill.		If I were to rate the songs on a scale of 1-5 stars, the best one would earn perhaps a 3 - "More Lost Without You."  The rest of the songs rated only 1 or maybe 2 stars each.  This is, in my opinion, the low point of the Parsons discography.  I do not begrudge anyone from following their chosen path, it's just not what I'd come to expect over the preceeding 13 releases.		Over all, I give this disc 2 stars for the music, and 1 star for negative shock value.  Shock value wins - 1 star from a 30+ year APP and Alan Parsons fan.
1,"Vertical smiles" is the most radio friendly sounding album by southern rockers Blackfoot. It can't compete at all with the previous excellent "Siogo" (which also had a tendency to be more towards the commercial side than earlier albums). But as usual there are a couple of songs that are very good, especially "In for the kill". But the overall impression is that it's too slick and polished, and lack the edge Blackfoot showed on "Strikes" and "Marauder". If you're looking for a first taste of Blackfoot, I don't think "Vertical smiles" is the best album to get.
1,After listening to this recording again yesterday. I would like to add my opinion to the others posted here. As the recording began, I started to think-"Hey, this isn't so bad". As it proceeded, I changed my mind to "Yes, it is.". This is a well conducted "Cavalleria" with great choral and ensemble work. The problem is, no one buys "Cavalleria" for the conducting:they want star performances and there are none here. Norman can be downright annoying and her duet with Turridu turns into a screaming match. Not a "Cavalleria" to listen to again and again unless you just want to play the choruses.
1,I love challenging, intense, intelligent, creative, original music. Nearly all of my favorite bands bring recommends' and fingers pointed in the direction of Radiohead.(my faves being; Tool, Neurosis, Faith No More, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Isis, Phallus Dei) Yet after all the desperate attempts to understand what people are seeing in Radiohead that I don't see, I've simply haulted my search. I cannot stand Radiohead, especially this album, I actually thought Amnesiac had a few cool songs though.	This is simply music to dress yourself in light blue, buy a golden book of nursery rhymes and then babysit yourself to death with.
1,they try to be funny, doesn't work		they try to be serious, doesn't work		they use eminem to sell records.... BINGO!!!
1,She is a superbe singer but I think is not country music. May be, in the past she started singing country??
1,This is not your typical Barry Manilow album, and I had hoped it would be.  It is a concept album supposedly about dealing with the rise and fall of someone famous.  The summary of what this song cycle really is about is a blueprint for a Broadway show.  That is not so bad, but Mr. Malilow is getting a little long in the tooth and his voice is not holding up so well; it is getting a little wobbly.  Additionally, he is enunciating too much and too hard.  It is distracting from the lyrics and the songs overall.  Perhaps he should have done like Elton John did with his Aida album and had guest vocalists and duet partners to introduce this set.		Don't get me wrong.  I am a huge Manilow fan.  I listened to his box set just last month, which basically covers the first half of his career, and I enjoyed it immensely.  But after all those covers albums, I had hoped Mr. Manilow would be getting back to basics like the Amazon description implied.  Not so and too bad.		I hope this set makes it to Broadway as I am sure Mr. Manilow would like to re-release Showstoppers with a bonus track from the Original Broadway Soundtrack from 15 Minutes.
1,This was my second Earl Klugh CD purchase and I was hoping for some more beautiful acoustic guitar music.  What a disappointment, however.  All the songs sound the same, have the same tempo, and you can barely make out Earl's playing from all the other instruments, etc.  Save your money.
1,This cd was horrible!  I tried to listen to it twice and just couldn't. I noticed that after her major success w/Dangerously in Love (which was an excellent album), Beyonce just went downhill. BDay was a mess and this is total garbage!  Disc 1 has only 2 good songs (Halo and Ave Maria).  Disc 2 has only 1 ok song (Sweet Dream) And you see how she made 2 cd's out of one?  Both cd's combined equal 63min!  Beyonce's just becoming 1)less creative, 2) greedy, 3)shallow, 4) a fake...I can go on and on.  To sum it all up- just negative  thanks partly to her new husband.  She loves him so much, she's trying to become him!  Solange's album was so much better!  Spend your money on that cd instead!  Or if not, just download the few songs from Sasha Fierce!  (what a corny title)
1,There rap gangs to is counting for too by listening I would need much more explanation from music then cover it self
1,Corey definitley needed the press to try to sell this album. I give him credit for creating the whole fiasco with Paula to try promote this album, but I don't even think God appearing before the world telling us all to go buy this album would STILL make this album very bad. There is no substance that grabs you and attracts you to its work. There is nothing new nor creative. It is stuff that has been done in years past and done in a very poor way. I can not even give him credit as a song writer after listening to Paulatics. WOW...bad...VERY VERY bad.
1,When I first read that BR would be releasing a Christmas album I chuckled, assuming it was a joke. Unfortunately it is a joke & not a very funny one. Is this another example of ground-into-the-dirt "irony" or BR expressing their warm sentiments of capitalism. What's next? An MTV Unplugged album or a collection of duets between Greg Graffin with Celine Dion, Michael Bolton, Whitney Houston, etc? I have all the BR back catalog but I will NOT purchase this. I think it may be finally time for them to retire if they're going to put out drivel like this. Don't get me wrong; I like some Christmas music, as in Phil Spector's Christmas album, Vince Guaraldi's 'A Charlie Brown Christmas'. I don't want to hear aging Punk Rockers trying to appeal to the modern Mall Punks of today.	By the way, "How Could Hell Be Any Worse?" is the GREATEST thing BR has ever put out. They will NEVER be able to match it;)
1,...Baby One More Time: A nice, pop album.  Upbeat, but follows the debut formula.	...Oops I Did It Again: better than "BOMT".  The songs are nice, her voice is nice. Her voice will never have the power to blow you away with talent, but hey, as long as it's "nice" you won't cringe, right?	...Britney: For me, this is when she started going downhil.  The only song I liked that was released from this album was "Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  her voice is getting worse--maybe from the smoking.	And now we have "In the Zone".  An album filled with either over-hyped, repetitive synthesizers or ballads where Britney warbles her way through.  "Toxic" is catchy, but it's not impressive at any point.  Her voice-Oh, wait, you can hardly HEAR her voice through the beats and computerized tones.  "ME Against the Music" was just horrible.  Madonna didn't help it.  "Everytime" is a song that has already had dwindling top40 popularity.  Why?  With ballads, you can't hype them up.  You leave them as is; and with Britney's whiney voice, you just can't support a song.	All in all, skip this "music".  She reminds me of *NSYNC.  I used to like them, but with each subsequent CD, the music and their voices got worse.  I don't know what it is; but Britney's voice has really gotten just horrible.
1,By 1981, The Rolling Stones had lost a lot of the magic. Their singles were hardly making the top 20 and their albums still sold high ("Black And Blue" was number one for nine weeks in a row) but were not as good as "Sticky Fingers", "Exile On Main Street" or anything from the peak period. Also suffering was their live shows. Once a group whose concerts were full of energy and theatrics, they now are boring and don't even do most of the songs that good.	The main problem I have with this dvd is the songs themselves. They don't sound like Stones songs at all. "Beast Of Burden", "Shattered" and "You Can't Always Get What You Want" (to name a few) could have been done by any hack tribute band. Their performance of "Jumpin' Jack Flash" is good, but you can tell by the way they just jump right into  the second verse when you go to it that it's been edited. "Miss You" is bland despite some great sax work, and "Let It Bleed" (a song I was intially looking forward to) doesn't work live. If you want to see a great live performance of this song, buy the "4 Flicks" boxed set, watch the Madison Square Garden concert (which I happened to attend). See how well they do this song in an indoor venue rather than an outdoor stadium.	The only redeeming momenst in this film are "Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)" and the models on "Honky Tonk Women". Otherwise, this dvd is a total waste of time and money. Also, I advise to stay away from "Still Life", the 1982 live album that was culled from the same tour.
1,Leonard Bernstein was indeed a great exponent of Mahler's music, especially during the sixties. But, I am sad to say, he was not always its best interpreter. Bernstein's presentations of Mahler are often big and bold - or, in other words, overloaded - and occasionally he even adds instrumental effects just to make the music to sound even more swollen (consider, for example, the addition of a bass drum stroke in the ultimate chord of symphony no. 1). Passages that require sophistication are often underlined with broad, syrup-sentimental strokes. This is especially the case with these late Mahler recordings, which Bernstein made for DG.		In some people's taste, this is just wonderful. They want showpieces and nothing else. But other people might have other intuitions regarding Mahler's music. For example, they want orchestral balance and not too deliberate takes.		Now this DG set is incredibly expensive - $191! My advice, if you want a set with Bernstein's Mahler, is to look for the set with his earlier recordings for CBS/SONY. You get it for a third of the price ($ 63), and the interpretations are usually far better in all respects (with the exception of No. 5).		But if you just want the best box with the complete symphonies of Gustav Mahler, I would recommend Rafael Kubelik's set (DG collectors series) as the first choice. Kubelik's interpretations are far more balanced and presented without mannerism, and, overall, his set is more consistent than any of Bernstein's. For reference, you could then add the selected gems of Bernstein's early Mahler recordings: Nos. 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.		Thus I give two stars for this DG set, three stars for the earlier CBS/SONY set, and four stars for Kubelik's set.
1,According to some reviews, this musical was supposed to be very good and I bought it. Unfortunately, I was quite dissapointed. It's composed of three different tales, the first one referring to the Adam & Eve biblical story. The lyrics here are very silly and tedious. The second tale, "The Lady or the Tiger?" contains songs that are simply awful, probably the worst ever written for a Broadway show. The third story, "Passionella", contains music that does nothing to make things better. The album contains a good informative booklet in English, German, French & Italian (as Sony uses to do)which says that Time magazine defined this show as "three moldy figs". I entirely agree. I would recommend this musical to those suffering from insomnia: it will put them to sleep right away.
1,I know many people were mad when this compilation was missing the band's first major hit, "Soul Finger," but this release only focuses on the resurrected Bar-Kays from their Mercury records period (several years after the 1967 plane crash that killed all, but two of its original members).  This album only has selections from 1976's Too Hot To Stop to 1989's Animal, however there are some major hits and more memorable songs missing from this compilation that its disgustingly a waste of a compilation.  R&B hit songs like "Boogie Body Land," "Today Is the Day," "Lets Have Some Fun," "Freaky Behavior," "She Talks To Me With Her Body," "Do It (Let Me See You Shake)," "Body Fever," "Running In & Out Of My Life," "Spellbound,"  "Dirty Dancer" and "Your Place Or Mine" were all missing.  What do you get instead are "Shut The Funk Up," "Cozy," "Deliver Us," "Standing On The Outside," which were either less memorable (though I enjoyed "Cozy") or weren't even charted songs.  I wasn't even feeling the last two tracks that were made in the late 80s ("Certified True" and "Struck By You") because I felt that the Bar Kays' transition to New Jack Swing wasn't as smooth as I expected even though those two songs were at respectable ranks on the R&B charts (sometimes a charted hit doesn't mean that the song is good).  "Struck By You" (released in 1989) was the only song not produced by the Bar-Kays' longtime friend and producer, Allen Jones due to his untimely death in 1987.  Not having "Holy Ghost" (a funkier melody twist of The Commodores' 1975 hit single, "Slippery When Wet") was my problem, but I guess it was during their short stint at Stax Records and Mercury records couldn't get the rights to put that song on the compilation (In 1978, Stax records released one last album by the band called, Money Talks to fulfill their contractual obligations that was overdue, and "Holy Ghost" was the only single released from that album).  It was sampled in countless Hip-Hop and dance songs in the late 80s and early 90s.  Though a few of my favorites like "Holy Ghost," "Body Fever," and "She Talks To Me With Her Body" are missing, it still has my other favorites like "Move Your Boogie Body," "Shine," "Freak Show On The Dance Floor" "Attitudes" and of course, "Anticipation" (that song wasn't released as a single, but it was one of their most memorable slow jams to this day.  The Bar-Kays were known for "jacking beats" from recently popular R&B songs and one of them was "Freak Show On The Dance Floor" of which the beat was ripped from Midnight Star's hit, "No Parkin' On The Dancefloor."  Midnight Star's song was released several months before "Freak Show" however "Freak Show" was a much success(so big that it was included in the 1984 hit movie, Breakin'), peaking at #3 on the R&B charts while dipping in the top 100 Billboard in early 1984.  Overall, I gave the compilation 2 stars for the omission of several of its hit songs and one or two memorable tracks.  That's why The Best of part 2 was made.
1,Think about it,if they had a ounce of talent,would they hide beneath those idiotic get-ups?
1,I thought this was the followup to Cyclorama which was by no means great (but had a few decent songs on it).  Then I started to say, wait a minute, I've heard these songs before.  Then I realized Styx made a cover album, wow I felt excited (NOT).  Styx gives no significance whatsoever by redoing these great songs even though the vocal delivery is pretty good which is the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one.  This CD is just not needed whatsoever, and is truly for the die hard fans.  I myself am a BIG Styx fan, with CD's like Grand Illusion, Crystal Ball, Pieces Of Eight, Equinox, etc being some of my all time favorites.  I had the pleasure of seeing Styx twice during their original comeback tour (Reopening Of The Paradise Theatre) with Tommy Shaw and Dennis DeYoung.  They were awesome!!!  A few laters I seen Styx WITHOUT Deyoung and with some other missing members and I have to admit there was something lacking.  They seemed to being the tours now for the gigs and nothing more.  Now with new lead singers, new albums, Greatest Hits & Live CDs galore, constant touring, the Styx industry seems to live on and on.  But is it really alive and kicking???
1,If you went to Berklee or something, this DVD might be for you. For an ordinary Blues, Rock, player like myself, this DVD isn't that terrific. I wonder if Eric Clapton could make any sense if this DVD? I would try Desi Serna, or Will Landrum DVDs instead to learn modes.
1,After hearing every other Mushroomhead offering, I thought they were on a good turn when they did "The End Of All Things To Come."		However, upon hearing this borrowed CD, I was more than happy to give it back. Borrow it first, or d/l it from somewhere...then hear it for yourself. You'll hear how low MH has sunk to make this crappy CD.
1,I was listening to some great Arab music on NPR the day I bought this CD. A few songs are good, but too many are westernized almost like rap music. If you want authentic music, this will not be the right choice.
1,As with the last four releases from these guys I am surprised everytime theyr elease something and legions of mindless fans flock to their defense.	Let's get this straight, if the lead singer wasn't Vedder, this guys fizzle right off.  Secondly if they had releases any other album beside Ten as their debut, they would not have got a second chance at making another release.		If  they put out Backspacer, Riot act, Vitology, Avocado etc...etc. They would have had a hard time convincing the record label to give them a chance, and had they did. 75% of the sales would have been gone from lack of any type of following and they would have disbanded in '93.	Had they pooled every Album since Ten they may have been able to scrape together another fine cd from the decent songs on all those cd's.	Jjust sucks listening to them and hear one or two songs that are grooving then have your speakers blown out due to a half put together song that they think will be well accepted by 13 year old's because it is 150 decibles. Just makes me want to turn it off immediately. No continuity at all in the layout of their music.		Apparently no producer has the mind to tell them to turn it down or leave out so much filler.
1,Don't worry, there's nothing outright awful on this album--but there's nothing great either. I don't know what the other reviewers got out of this, but this is as middle-of-the-road as it gets. Nothing stands out, including "Left Hook" which has a video for it. I love classic Armored Saint, especially "Raising Fear" & "March of the Saint". This DOESN'T sound like either of those. It's even weaker than "Revelation" & "Delirious Nomad". The only thing I can recommend this for is if someone has insomnia--play this at a low volume in your MP3 player and you'll find yourself fast asleep in no time!
1,and it shows because R.Kelly is not putting the effort into his recordings like he used to. I know he has legal fees to pay, but fans don't like a rush job and this cd sounds like rush job. "In The Closet" is the only reason why you should buy this cd because the other songs are just plain sad.
1,I have to concurr with the E. Minkovitch review, this concert is awful, (and I HAVE seen the whole thing). No matter how worthy your boat is, if you put too much weight in it, it can sink or capsize. That's the problem here: too many jazz heavyweights trying to squeeze their talents into music that is not jazz.		In this concert, the boat doesn't even get out of the harbor before it tips over. Thankfully, the boat is righted during one song, about 3/4 of the way through: the Steve Winwood performance of the Timmy Thomas classic: "Why Can't We Live Together." Steve Winwood's performance is so heartfelt, it will send shivers up your spine, at the same time it will bring tears to your eyes. Simply awesome.		But one good song on a 2-DVD set is ridiculous. As a longtime fan of Santana's mid-70's jazz period, especially the album, "Love, Devotion and Surrender," I was shocked at how painful it was to watch this concert. Ouch! The music performed during this show is not the Santana jazz we appreciated in the 70's, nor is it contemporary jazz, despite the presence of Wayne Shorter, Ravi Coltrane and Herbie Hancock. What a mess. What a disappointment.
1,Completely boring and lacking in any sort of musical quality. Literally, the same 4 notes endlessly repeated on a piano for 43 minutes, with the same 2 or 3 notes slowly droned out on a violin. It sounds OK for a few minutes, but as time passes and you realize that this is all the entire album consists of, it's very annoying. After a few playings I threw it in the trash... and so will you !
1,Like many late gen-xers I grew up listening to NKOTB in the 1980's. Then, the ascention of Nirvana and other 'grunge' bands heralded a permanent changing of the music world--the less polish, the better.	If the band was going to surive such new conditions, it needed to reinvent itself for the changing times.	Sensing G-rated bubblegum would no longer suffice in this new 'edgier' world., band member Donnie Wahlberg attempted to remix some of the greatest hits to continue the cash flow, but the direction ruined the band's reputation as the clean cut boys next door.	As evidenced by the cover photo and art, the group tried on a 'rough' image which may have been more closer to the actual outside environments of their Boston childhoods, but would drive away the pre-teen and child fans who had made their millions possible.	Especially compared to the blockbuster hits of the earlier records, sales were abysmal and the 'adult' NKOTB was shortly disbanded for (admittedly successful) solo careers. Whether this downturn was covertly planned is a matter of debate to this day, but it was the proverbial last hurrah from the "Fab Five".	Although many other greatest hit albums have surfaced since then, this work is unique because it was the death knell of the act itself.
1,You simply cannot take a band with Lizzy's caliber and vast discography, throw in it 16 songs and call it "DEFINITIVE COLLECTION". Call it "Best Of", "Greatest Hits", whatever. But "Definitive" this is not, no way!		That's why I rate it two stars: not for the songs (which are great) but by the misleading concept of this merchandise.
1,i SAW THIS BAND IN IT'S ORIGINAL FORM, PLAY AT THE WOODSTOCK PLAYHOUSE WHEN i WAS A KID.	  tHEY BLEW ME AWAY.For some reason I never picked up the LP.	  Now I find, that CD's are like 50 bucks.	  The same thing happened with another woodstock based album,	Happy and Artie TRaum.	  This album is huge bucks if you can find it.	  Since the masters obviously exist somewhere, why are CD's so expensive?
1,This is not a very good CD.  I bought it after reading a couple of reviews, and hey, the price is attractive.  The CD is a disappointment.  The band sounds kind of like an unmusical Iggy & the Stooges.  There's a lot of sonic sludge over the course of the disc.  I didn't find anything I even halfway liked until track # 9, which is a little Pretenders-ish.  I spent less than half of the cost of a regular CD, but even then I felt like I wasted my money.  Two other comments: (1) It IS amusing that a band called the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have a song called "No No No." (Even if the song is less than great.)  (2) I'm willing to forgive a bad CD cover if the music is good (like with The Coral), but this CD is bad, and geez, that's one awful CD cover!
1,this is certainly a standout album but for all the wrong reasons. The album suffers from three main flaws. 1: the songs lack sparkle, either lyrically or musically. 2: The vocals are muffled and buried in the mix. 3: (the most prominent reason) Dangermouse manages to suck any remaining life out of the album. He creates an almost unlistenable soundscape in which the instrumentation (particularly the drums) are unsympathetic to the songs. This has little to do with the delightfully left of center Mutations, barely reined in chaos of Midnight Vultures and Guero or the strained subtlety of Morning Phase.
1,This album starts out weak and gets weaker as it goes. Paul's second attempt at a true "solo" album (where he plays all the instruments) falls flat. Some people think it was his attempt to do punk but it's more like his experimental stuff he does as "The Fireman".  But when Paul experiments stuff like melody and structure go out the window. He'd have been better off saving these songs, and interspersing the stronger ones in future albums and as B-sides rather than release them all together. AND it doesn't have the superior live version of "Coming Up" which came as a single with the original vinyl album.
1,From the opening track, which is not only quite lame, but also the best one in the album, you can't help but wonder if his ego ever allowed him one second of regret for leaving Pink Floyd. Roger Waters' best days are way behind him. His constant bullying of the other members of his former band as well as technical assistants finally gave fruit when he was left alone to pursue his dreams of grandeur. For a man who despised his former mates, he sure milks "Dark Side.." and "The Wall" every chance he can, as no other artists or bands are breaking down the door to cover his later works. This album, s well as "The Cons and Pros of HitchHiking" deserve a worse and more humilliating death than that of the Soviet Empire.
1,What is everybody's problem anyway, this album wasn't even successful. Plus, Led Zeppelin, "the greatest band on the planet", lost their drummer and called it quits. Come on, surely the greatest band of all time could find the perfect replacement, seems like they could survive for more than 11 years. Let me give you a list of bands that continue after losing a band member and you guys can shut up about Led Zeppelin being the best band ever.		Bands which have lost a band member and have continued afterward.		Metallica:Cliff Burton(bassist):one name, Jason Newstead		Def Leppard:im not a real big fan but I heard they lost their guitar player, but they reformed the band and continued.		The Who:Keith Moon(drummer):The Who hired a new drummer and they later recorded 'You Better you Bet'		Lynard Skynard:The whole damn band!(their relatives recreated it like 5 years after their deaths)		Motley Crue:Nikki Sixx(bassist):Had an enormous drug overdose which left him dead, but while in ambulance, he suddenly resurrects, so all hail Nikki!		Mayhem:Norweigan death metal band:frontman commits suicide, guitarist eats frontmans brains, bassist kill guitarist, bassist goes to jail and escapes only to be caught again. The only original member is the drummer.		Kiss:Eric Sarr(drummer):died while on tour, they replaced him and continued playing.		Ac/Dc:Bon Scott(frontman):died choking on his own vomit. Ac/Dc replaces him with Brian Johnson, and enjoy the most successful years of their carrers.		Ozzy Osbourne:Randy Rhoads(guitarist):died tragically at the young age of 25 when the plane he was in crashed into a house and everyone aboard was killed. After months of depression at the lost of his best friend, Ozzy releases Bark at the Moon with new guitarist Jake E. Lee.		Randy Castillo(former Ozzy and Motley Crue drummer):died of some kind of cancer. Wasn't in any band at that time, but a ton of people showed up for his funeral.		So as you can see, these guys have no excuse. They only lost the drummer man, and he was old. I mean come on, if Nikki Sixx could rise from the dead, why cant Jon Bonham? If Ozzy can come back stronger than ever from losing the best friend he ever had in a plane accident, then Led Zepplin has no excuse.
1,Don't buy this based on "Ready To Roll", as I did.  It's a great song, but it's pretty much the only one.  Nothing else on the album has the same energy.  It's all the typical, generic pop-rock type stuff you hear everywhere.  Nothing stands out... musically, vocally, lyrically... nothing special.  Buy "Ready To Roll" on iTunes and don't bother with the rest of the album.
1,Meandering reggae sound experiments and preachy lyrics condemn this Clash effort to the little played pile. After the ferocity of earlier work, this sounds like a band that has lost direction or worse has been co-opted by a feeling of self-importance. The only memorable numbers are the juvenile singles "Rock The Casbah" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go" which at least have melody and rhythm to recommend them. "Straight To Hell also jumps out as an example of more restraint getting better results in the midst of all this chaos. If at least the sonic clarity was better, the effort to wade through the noise and mumbling might be worth while, but as it is this was a few plays for me and then it will be collecting dust.
1,I was ready for a "Who" concert (you know, when they were good!)  This DVD/concert is absolutely horrid.
1,I have been a fan of Ciara since she came out with "Goodies." At first, I thought she was a skinny, no singing diva from Riverdale, but the more I started to listen to her, the more hooked I got to her music. Usually, I like the music that Ciara releases because she know how to make you shake a tail feather with her upbeat, dance-craving, crunk, Atown music, but I was disappointed in this release. I anticipated this CD for the longest because I really like "The Evolution of Cici."  I actually had her CD 2 1/2 weeks before it was released, and the more I listened to it, the more I was disappointed. She really doesn't have a club banger on this album. The four best songs are:	  -Ciara to the stage	  -Lover's thing	  -Like a surgeon	  -Go girl (not available on all copies b/c it's considered a "bonus")	I seem to have an urge to skip songs like:	  -I don't remember	  -Pucker up	  -Love, Sex, and Magic (Gasp! I know! I don't like the song)	  -G is for girl	  -Work	I was just not moved with this cd! Cici has been missing in action for a while, I was kinda hoping this cd would give her fans something to be happy about...but I was wrong. C'mon Cici! You can do better than this! I found a bunch of her new, unreleased music, and I made a cd from those songs that sound better than this one! This is almost as bad as listenin to I am...Sasha Fierce! Get it together Cici...for your career's sake or Keri Hilson will end your career! :( (No offense to the Keri Hilson fans because I like her too)
1,I don't think time will be kind to this release from one of America's shining new stars.  While the force of her singing and some fine pieces of songcrafting come through, the album is adrift in weak songwriting, ill-conceived forays into blues and gospel, and most notably horrible engineering.  No one makes you listen to a record with headphones(or just closely) but it usually helps to fully appreciate the music.  Not in this case; close scrutiny is not advised.  So we are left with some pretty sounding music that doesn't leave you with much to think or feel about.
1,I can't believe this is the same band that brought us "Tormented" and "Dysfunction", I shake my head in disbelief.  I had heard of Staind almost four years ago when a friend of mine had gotten their original first album called "Tormented", an album that was violent, loud, and heavy, and had cover art of blood stained dolls, inverted crucifixes, and satanic suggestions.  So naturally I dug them.  They were the kind of band I was looking for then that brought the heavy melody of Alice in Chains and were nearly as heavy as Pantera.  Then Fred Durst gets them a real record deal and they put out "Dysfunction", which was a good album though not as heavy as their original debut.  Then I hear a song called "Outside" that sounded a bit too poppy and even had Fred Durst credited for singing on it even though he only says about three words during the whole thing.  I started to get leary of what was happenning to Staind, and then my worst fear was realised.  I hear "It's Been Awhile", and the first time I heard it, I thought to myself "sell out and cash in", and I was right.  Since then "It's Been Awhile" became very overplayed and "Break the Cycle" went triple platinum.  Another thing is "It's Been Awhile" sounds very reminiscent of one of Alice in Chains' hit singles, "Down in a Hole".  Every song is about the same old "woe is me, I hate myself, I want to die, buy our record" lyric content that gets extremely repetitive rather quickly.  Aaron Lewis sounds like he's begging to be loved rather than demanding to be hated like he did on Staind's brilliant debut album "Tormented", and their rather good follow up "Dysfunction", and now whenever I hear Staind on the radio or see them on TV, I simply click the OFF button.
1,the strokes are definitely one of the best marketed bands to come around in a while; so i won't get too personal, i'm sure they're just a bunch of young pretty boys having fun.  but the saviors of rock and roll?  come on, man.  to 'save rock and roll' in this day and age -- if we are to believe the strokes are the ones doing it -- is merely to prop up a cliched corpse and hope no one says anything disparaging.	there is so much exciting and groundbreaking new music out there right now -- why jerk off to this stuff?	if they hadn't gotten so big, they would have been a fun band to see on a friday night in nyc... but not too much more than that, not if you're looking for something that sticks to your ribs).	peace (and borrow this cd before you buy, everyone and their dog has this)
1,The highlights for me were" Nickel and a nail" by Otis Rush, and a duet by Delbert Mcclinton and Renee Austin called "Pretend we never met". The DVD extra was nice if only to Tommy Castro the rest was not so hot.
1,I (wisely) borrowed this CD from my local library when I lived in NYC. Upon completing a full listening of the album in one sitting I realized that when one dies, and is greeted by Satan himself into the gates of Hell, this is the soundtrack of the entire experience.	Yoko Ono sounds like the harp of an angel, in comparison.
1,elo being mostly 70s dynamic people time secret messages &armchair theatre solo are the only worthwhile stuff power turns empty once you pass the so serious track
1,Well, the second act certainly is different from "Act 1", the original "Village Green", or the pseudo-prequel "Schoolboys". Better? Oh no! Certainly not! This double (:O) album is heavy on plot radio announcements between songs. Eventually the story meanders around, our hero defeats the evil Mr. Flash, and the grand message is, power corrupts everything. Capitalists like Flash and communists like Black both made intolerable like in the ideal town. Interesting message, only the long journey to get there wasn't all that enjoyable. So, out of the actual songs, "Money Talks" and "He's Evil" are above average and different from other Kinks sounds. Unless you are a completest or really need to finish this saga (you really don't), get those songs and don't suffer through the entire record.
1,"Timeless," "Tom Waits Can Do No Wrong," "Tom Waits is God," blah, blah, blah...all verbatim quotes from the reviews below.  Any artist worth his salt would cringe at such adulation. After releasing the worst album of his often illustrious career, one only hopes His Highness can still cringe.	If one bothers to look through the few reviews that wrote critically on Mule Variations, they all coincide on the same points: Waits is recycling the same ol' textures, ideas, sounds, arrangements and, to top it all off, his songwriting is downright soporific. It's shamelessly parodic -- and no one seems to mind, including Tom! Those who've had the pleasure of being awed by Waits' output prior to this fiasco would wish he had never released it: It seems to signal a nearly irreversible downward road in Waits' creativity.	Just as frightening as the quality of the album is the mindless bandwagon mentality evident in the majority of the reviews for Mule Variations. Not only are these 'fans' falling over each other to elevate mediocrity to the status of genius, the album even won a Grammy! Typical. Wait till an artist produces his most drab conventional work ,and the music industry will reward him for it: Conformity, rather than innovation, is far easier to explain, understand, and consume. Sheep for the Mule.	With such unbridled eagerness to act and think alike as most of the reviewers below display, cloning is bound to become redundant before it even takes off.
1,The CD was blank.  It did not have a sound to it.  I've thrown away the packaging so I could not send it back.
1,There is no denying Shand's talent.  He played just about every instrument on the record (and I mean instrument, not keyboard with guitar/drum/bellaphone sound), produced everything himself and wrote everything himself.  He's all about the old school sound and arrangements, and I applaud his apparant effort to bring back the musicianship to music; the soul to R&B.	The problem is the songs aren't very strong (nostalgic and showcases his abilties just fine, but not great songs) and he sounds like too many other cats in the process.  If Jay from Jamiroquai did a solo record, it'd sound like this, but better.  Shand might have actually benefitted from someone not merely seeing the blue-eyed soul marketing in his contributions and dumping another player or producer her and there.  It wouldn't change his too-often symbiotic voice (sometimes he's Jay, sometimes he's the guy from Simply Red, but never with the great songs to match), but it might have given us something else to roll with.	Nice try, and again, I like the sentiment, but give him another album to get it right.
1,Since I've been alive, Rubio has always been there. I won't deny it: she has some good songs as reflected by "Planeta Paulina" , the self-titled "Paulina" as well as "El tiempo es oro". She has enough material to put two greatest hits cd's together, as oppossed to her rival Thalia. Nevertheless, this production has not much to offer. My attention went to "Si tu te vas", and "Baila casanova", but the rest was indistinct due to her heavy accent which almost sounded like my Mexican physics teacher. The lyrics are absurd and there are just to many songs like these on this cd. In the battle of who can speak with the least accent, Rubio loses to  Shakira, Thalia, and Laura Pausini. She just can't sing in English. She will never surpass her "Paulina" cd, as most of these songs are unmemorable. Joey Guerra, Amazon's reviewer for this album is really a fan of this girl or feels sorry for her , because despite this horrible production, he praises it with "terrific hooks" and "border music never sounded so savvy." She is  another mediocre artist forgotten by the American audience and  readopted by Mexico. All in all, this is a dull waste of your money.
1,Honestly, with all of the great Raider albums available on Sundazed, and several excellent compilations (Hungry For Kicks on Rev-Ola & Kicks: The Anthology on Raven)that are only a few bucks more than this disappointment, why are you even considering this? The sound (and believe me, I'm not an audio snob-I have a nice system, but I didn't take out a loan for it) is REALLY BAD. I suppose if you have no memory of the power these songs had, you'd never notice. Yes, (at the time of release)it contained songs that were otherwise very tough to find, and yes, there is a nice booklet, and yes, if you are a fanatic Raiders lover, you probably have to buy it because you can't help yourself. BUT, if you just remember that these guys, regardless of the teeny-bopper image (and that's all it was-an image)rocked supremely, and that their recordings were sonically superior to most mid-sixties stuff, then please look elsewhere. If you are interested, Collector's Choice is releasing a complete set on three discs of every Raiders single. That might be more than you want...or not. Anyway, you can do much, much better than this. I gave it two stars for the booklet and because, however muddy the mix, and however frustrating the remixes, it is, after all, Paul Revere & the Raiders. I could never give 'em one star.
1,Most likely due to the disappointing sales of her last LP, Bionic, Christina Aguilera decided to play it safe this time by releasing a generic electropop album, but ironically, capitulating to music trends may prove to be her downfall.  Thats not to say, Lotus, out in the US, on November 13, is awful, but it isn't terribly interesting, either.		Even on first listen, the tracks blend together to the point where it becomes difficult to tell where one song ends and the next one begins.  Some of the more mediocre uptempos, like Cease Fire and Army of Me (a Fighter ripoff, but at least shes ripping off herself) couldve been great with better production and the ballads aren't half bad: Blank Page would have been amazing with better vocals (more on that below) and Just a Fool is pretty good, but would have been better with Christina by herself, rather than as a duet with Blake Shelton.  Theres also a song with Cee-lo Green (Make the World Move) that fails to deliver.		There are a few grave missteps as well: Circles and Around the World are puerile banality, and for those who are unfortunate enough to purchase the deluxe edition, youll get another shoddy track, Shut Up.  Christinas music has never had amazing lyrics, but the ones on these songs are truly pitiful as is the production, and I want to know what she and her record company were thinking when they allowed them to be on this album.  Its called quality control, people.  The only remotely stand out tracks on the album, are the intro (its called an intro, but is pretty much a real song) and the lead single, Your Body, which works nicely as an antithesis to Christinas debut single, Genie in a Bottle: in the latter, Christina has certain criterion a guy must meet before she agrees to sleep with him; in the former, she just wants to screw her brains out, even if the guy isn't up to par (in the song, she exclaims, If you don't know where to go, Ill finish off on my own).		Another big problem is Christinas vocals.  Shes known as the voice of her generation, but sounds like anything but as she strains to hit her notes on practically every track, with the most offensive being the ballads, Blank Page and Sing for Me. If this is what she sounds like on a polished recording, I shudder to think what shell sound like when she sings these songs live.  Hopefully, shes been working with a good vocal coach to get herself back up to snuff for those live performances.	I know this review may come off as rather harsh, but its only because Im a huge fan of Christina Aguilera (I own all of her studio albums and still listen to the last three regularly) and was expecting better.  While shes never been the biggest pop star, shes always been one of the most talented.
1,Just okay. Nothing like the one she did with they guy from the White Stripes (VanLeerRose?) I love Loretta but	the songs on this one are entirely forgettable.
1,who needs to buy this album? all you have to do is hang out down at the local home depot. there is nothing creative about his music at all. just watered down, focus group approved, bland songs.
1,20 Y.O. is one of the most boring Janet Jackson eras along with her first two albums and Damita Joe. Just look at the cover art and tell me it is not dull and the font is not unattractive. It is just a failure, if you ask me. The whole album is filled with silly dance tracks and nothing new or fun to hear about Janet's life or her personal feelings involving anything other than dancing or sex. I do like Enjoy though, which is a rather cute song. But still, if that is the highlight of the album, something weird is going on. While this is not really worth repeated listens to me, some of her biggest fans will want to buy this. Her voice also sounds better than usual though. Very honey like... I would like to hear some good tunes sung in this voice! So there is a positive for fans. But it still does not pick up a silly album. If silly is not a too exciting word to describe 20 Y.O.
1,this cd is an insult to country. please show me a REAL country song that says "wha, wha" or "bling blingin" gimme a break. if you liked save a horse ride a cowboy than you might like this cd but don't say that you like country. i might have to hide my face in shame
1,This might have been Madonna's worst CD if she hadn't followed it with American Life (her rap cd!). Coming afer Ray of Light it's below average. Everything about this set of songs is gloomy, defeated, downbeat and low-rent. They seem to be written for someone with a three-note range. Most of the songs are slow, dirges. Madonna attempts to inveigle her way back onto dance floors with some regrettable (now hysterical) autotuning. She learned to play guitar for this cds appearances and thankfully Madonna's guitar playing career is now finished. The songs reflect the sort of lifeless strumming she could be entrusted to master in the short schedule between two cd releases. Worst of all is the song 'Music.' A feebler, more embarassing single has never been released.
1,Following his "comeback" success with "Flowers in the Dirt" and the subsequent world tour that followed, Paul should have followed up with an even stronger album.	This ain't it.	Paul took his  new socially/enviromentally conciousnees to the studio...and came out with  a vapid, preachy, boring mess.	It's not a total loss (no McCartney album  ever is). The title track is catchy enough. "Get Out of My Way"  is a bit of a rocker that came out better live. And I'm kinda fond of  "C'mon People" in spite of myself. In addition, "Hope of  Deliverence" is one of his better tunes that should have appeared on  "Flowers..."	Paul and his band performs well thruout...it's a  shame that the material they were performing was less than  memorable.	Basicly, this was a "let's get an album out so we can  tour" thing...the tour was sucessful, the album pretty dismal. For  completeists only.
1,This does sound somewhat like the ABB, but what an inferior product.  I generally like it when a band attempts stylistic changes, but the female choruses and horn solos in these efforts just don't ring true.  And fiddle?	*Hell & High Water - were they aware that they were borrowing the melody of "Will The Circle Be Unbroken?" ?  Choruses sound out-of-place, but otherwise the song is OK	*Mystery Woman - more Pop than most ABB songs, but one of the better tunes on the disc	From The Madness Of the West - very derivative of "Jessica", but lacking a real spark, almost sounds like an ABB imitation	*I Got A Right To Wrong - has the ABB sound, the best song on this CD	Angeline - flat arrangement, more worthy of Lynyrd Skynyrd, weak lyrics, good drumming	Famous Last Words - awful background chorus, very bad song	Brothers of the Road - the ABB do The Charlie Daniels Band?  Fiddles?	*Leavin' - pretty good, the sound is here starts to sound like their '90s work	Straight From The Heart - awful pop song, sounds like bad Doobie Brothers	*The Judgment - different, not bad, hard country-rock	Never Knew How Much - stoopid background choruses, not enough (any?) band, vapid sax solo, could be improved by a better arrangement	* indicates the songs I consider decent, though none are great	I agree with the assessment that Arista was looking for another Doobie Brothers.  It's odd what expectations can do; I would like these songs better on a Marshall Tucker Band or Outlaws disc, but the ABB were capable of so much more.  Almost the whole CD sounds like an ABB imitation, the solos are derivative of older - and better - songs,  the lyrics are rehashes, the arrangements are often too pop sounding.  Some cuts have the characteristic ABB drum sound, guitar scale bridges and vocal growling, but it sounds perfunctory. Being a longtime ABB fanatic, I want to totally hate this CD,  but it is listenable - just not inspired.  Approaching this as a Country-Rock disc and not a typical ABB disc allows objectivity, but hearing merely OK material from a great band is a let down.  I can't say that I'll play it much.
1,Ive always wondered if I would like Dead Can Dance. I knew going in that they were more of a world sound and this disc that I found in a thrift store was a cheap and safe intro to them. What The Serpents Egg sounds like to my ears is a lot of Indian music and chants mixed in with slower EDM synths. Sometimes the drones were just too much. Other songs were okay. Most of the vocals were not in English (which was okay too) and most were female I think but there were a couple of songs with male leads. A lot of the music had an ethereal quality and I liked a couple of the songs (Ullyses was one of them) but there was too much repetition overall that killed the experience for me. Im tempted to suspect that though this wasn't my cup of tea other albums by DCD might be more to my liking because they play around with different world sounds? Maybe, but 2.5 stars for this one.
1,A guy I work with was playing this CD last night and I was struck by how interesting the music was. An awkward white-boy funk that falls somewhere between the Dead Milkmen and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The keyboards add an especially unique sound. If this were an all-instrumental band, I'd enjoy it quite a bit.	The problem is, the lead singer sounds like a strangled cat. His idea of getting his emotions out is by squealing and screaming at piercing levels. He has no soul...not in the musical sense, anyway. I laughed when I read the reviews comparing him to Prince and James Brown. Puh-leeze. I can appreciate lo-fi garage, but this is ridiculous.	Two stars for the music, negative stars for the vocals. Fire the lead singer and regroup.
1,... I guess I must be a strange Kinks fan, because I found this CD to be very disappointing. I don't believe there was a single track that I found interesting/entertaining.	They've done SO much better...
1,I loved Secrets, and her debut album had Breathe Again, and Seven Whole Days, and I know times change, but except for " He Wasn't man Enough", which i don't really like ( but it is Toni Braxton .. have  you seen the video... AnEway)the other songs are below  sub-par, she seems  to try and appease everyone... with pop, R&B, and even a pathetic  attempt at some raps..Puhhleez ! and that Spanish Guitar Song...... worst  lyrics ever ! I am sorry this was a bad Buy !
1,While I appreciate the attempt to create a Music from Big Pink-like homemade vibe, the songs here are wan and dreary, lifelessly played and the production is drab. LaMontagne's voice and the title track have some appeal, but otherwise nothing much here.
1,I love WORLD WIDE LIVE. Musically, I give it 5 stars, but the remastered version only deserves one. Why? The remastering job stinks. The once powerful guitars are now buried in the mix. It sounds lame. Get a copy of an old tape instead. Once you do that, you'll see how awesome this album really is. All the songs really come alive here.
1,Introducing the next failed attempt by a predominantly Hip-Hop label to put out an album by an R&B artist.  This might be a little harsh, but if you look of the track record of anybody that does this, you will see that this hardly ever works.  Sure, Ashanti worked for a minute for Murder Inc, but does anybody actually own Concrete Rose?  Anybody remember the Def Jam offshoot named Def Soul?  Sure, it had Kelly Price, Dru Hill, and Case, but where are these artists now?  And let's talk about Rocafella itself.  How many years has Rell been on that roster without an album?  And Allen Anthony should've known he wasn't ever going to come out with an album considering the bad showing Rocafella had with his old group Christion.  Teairra Mari might want to be an exception to the rule, but she doesn't have the special quality that some pioneers have when it comes to marrying contemporary R&B and Hip-Hop music.		Sure, her break out single "Make Her Feel Good" made for great spins on the radio.  Songs like "Act Right" and "New Sh*t" have decent beats and songwriting, and the song "LaLa" has exquisite production that rivals any other track out there right now.  You can even enjoy "M.V.P." despite the pointless high notes during the chorus.  But then, that's pretty much all the good points of the album.  "Phone Booth" sounds a bit immature and unrefined, and "Get Up On Ya Gangsta" is nothing special in comparison to her better songs.  "Get Down Tonight" reminds you of L'Trimm's "Cars With The Boom" when it first starts off and the rest of the song leaves you with little to keep your attention.  And the second single "No Daddy" as well as the remix version are practically as annoying and ridiculous as Brooke Valentine's "Girlfight."		Brooke....i mean Ashanti....i mean Ciara....i mean Teairra Mari has a lot of work ahead of her if she thinks this will be a breakout album for her.  Once she becomes an adult, she will be able to expand her content and sing about more experiences she's had up to that time.  And maybe Jigga will have a handle on what it takes to promote an R&B artist in the industry already bubbling over with similar acts.  It's more than a notion to try to expand on the groundwork set by the likes of Mary J, Faith, and 112.  Hopefully by then, the music business as a whole will come to embrace this rising breed of urban music.
1,I normally avoid Clear Channel radio like the plague, but every so often I am subjected to it. The last time I was, I heard this, and it reminded me why so much modern "music" is to be avoided by anyone over the age of 10 with a functioning brain. Vapid, annoying, idiotic crap. The music is unimaginative, the beats, as per usual for hip hop, are simplistic and uninventive, and the lyrics sound like they were written by a mentally challenged 12 year old. As the title says, crap like this makes me envy the deaf. If you were to hear this and the equally idiotic "Hollback Girl" by Gwen Stefani back to back, it would be enough to cause you to jab an icepick into your brain to make the memory go away. Utter garbage.
1,When I listen to music, I want it to sound as close to the original studio performance as poss, so it should be stereo (where it exists) and remastered from the original master tapes, any faults or distortions etc. should be removed electronically.		An example of what should be done and what it should sound like is "The Motown box" set.	Comparing a track from this CD to the box set is like comparing a roller skate to a Rolls Royce, as ALL THE TRACKS ARE BAD QUALITY MONO. Yes there are die hard enthusiasts who insist Motown must be heard in mono, don't they have 2 ears.		There are statements made that the stereo versions were done by inexperiened engineers as an afterthought and were poor mixes, yes indeed this is correct, they were at first done often by inexperienced engineers and defo as an after thought as stereo had not caught on for pop as opposed to classical music, also AM mono radio ruled, however and it's a BIG HOWEVER, many tracks were subsequently remixed by experts who often tried to get a similar sound balance to the original mono balance, THESE TYPE OF STEREO REMASTERS SOUND SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE RATHER DISTORTED NASTY MONO VERSIONS, we do have 2 ears, so hear in stereo by nature, CB		PS Putting it another way, on these mono tracks much of the sound is missing, you just cannot hear certain instruments etc and Diana's voice is screechy and distorted, in a good stereo remix you will hear what she really sounded like, human as opposed to alien.		PPS Try "Gold" or No 1's or " Anthology" THE 2001 VERSION AS THERE ARE AT LEAST 4 CD'S BY THE SAME TITLE.
1,These are all re-sung recordings and not original.		If you want original recordings order "The Best of The Happenings"
1,There are two types of Steve Winwood music, and individual taste will dictate whether you will like this cd or not.  If you are the Winwood fan who perfers his R&B pop sound,["Valarie", "Higher Love", "Roll With It", "Gimmie Some Lovin" etc], you are going to more than likely find this cd a total bore.  If you perfer his soothing layed back jazzy traffic feel to his music, you are probably going to find this cd enjoyable.  Having said that, after listening to this cd a few times, I find the cd to be somewhat uneventful.  Well played and sung, but nothing that is going to be memorable, or even ear catching for that matter.  Most of the music comes across as bland.  I found the best song on the cd to be "At Times We Forget", which at least grabs the listeners ear, and is the most listenable track on this collection.  "Dirty City", is another fine song, and features Eric Clapton, and predictably sounds as if it came right out of the Blind Faith era.  The rest of the songs  basically sound the same, with that jazzy slow uninspired sound.  Steve Winwood is a great talent, but sometimes I feel he goes overboard with this smooth jazz sound that I also feel takes the fire out of many of his live shows.  I do not want to sound negative, but this cd is nothing near his best work and is average at best.
1,They weren't all new songs.  Two or three of them were on the Live In London CD.`
1,"Off the Hook" is a shameless collection of some of the tackiest, most irritating urban radio hits.  Sure, we get talented artists like Angie Stone, Aaliyah and Glen Lewis, but they get cancelled out by the appearances of Ja Rule & J.Lo, B2K, and Lil' Bow Wow.  Buy something else, please.
1,The band is flawlessly rehearsed, tight, and hugely talented. And they stand on stage for maybe 90 minutes doing all of the most foolish songs that Zappa wrote in his "dumbed down" period, where pandering to teenage potty humor and getting a hit record seemed to be his primary concerns.		The set opens with Zoot Allures, allowing one long Zappa guitar solo. After that, none of the fine musicians really has a chance to play much more than filler licks, with the possible exception of bass player Scott Thunes (who is well represented) and Chad Wackerman (who sits above the band with an air of calm detachment, so relaxed he makes his playing look effortless). Bobby Martin does a great vocal on the closing number, Whipping Post, but otherwise, it's silly songs all the way, and although the band delivers the goods with impeccable precision, no one looks as if he's having a whole lot of fun. The clowning is unspontaneous at best.		As for the video footage itself, it's well shot, impeccably edited, but with far too many closeups of Frank Zappa's face, and a strange absence of longshots of the stage (the audience-eye view is missing).		How unfortunate the no video seems to exist of the final Zappa tour, when they were tackling the most ambitious, complex, and beautiful compositions, with truly amazing jazz soloists and less of a focus on Zappa and his tendency toward self indulgence.		This DVD will satisfy anyone who wanted to know what a Zappa concert looked like, but the material is among the most trivial he wrote. Certainly humor belongs in music--but only if it's funny.
1,As the other reviewer indicates, if you want the properly recorded and edited Japan show, you want "This Time Around: Live In Japan". That double disc is leaps and bounds better than this sorry compilation. Don't make the mistake of getting "Last Concert In Japan". You'll regret it.
1,Bonjour!		That is french for hello.  If you are a linkin park fan, you probably didn't know that.		Well, Well, Well, what have we here?  Another masterpiece of random jumbled screaming and a so very horrible DJ put together into an annoying sequence and called a CD.		Crappin' Park cannot make music for their lives!!!  This lame excuse for a CD is the weakest debut I've ever seen.  Of all the incompident, stupid moronic idiots, these 5 had to get together and pretend they made something that sounded good.  But, alas, their hopes were in vain, and their "hybrid theory" was trash.		The song Cure for the Itch is pointless, the song One Step Closer is too short, and the song By Myself is too much of a screaming(literally) sensation.		How Do You put a giraffe in the refrigiorator......		You open the door, put in the giraffe and close the door.		How do you put an elephant in the refrigiorator?		Open the door, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant, and close the door.		The lion king is hosting a meeting of all the animals.  Which one doesn't attend?		The elephant...he's in the refrigiorator.		You must cross a pirahna-infested river without a boat.  How do you get across?		you jump in and swim across, the pirahnas are at the lion king's meeting.		If you couldn't figure out the above questions, you are clearly an idiot, and obviously a linkin park fan who thinks my review sucks.		Au Revoir		That's french for Goodbye.  If you are a linkin park fan, you probably didn't know that.
1,I just received the Gebhardt Version of Furtwangler's GREAT Ring of RAI 1953. To my very astonishment the recording sounds distorted and uneven. I have the EMI version that was republished some months ago 50999 9 08161 2 3. The sound in that recording is certainly not perfect, but at least it has a full and rich sound whereas the Gebhardt recording has a super sharp unconfortable sonority. I am a professional musician, and I may guarantee you: Furtwangler HIMSELF will not approve the remastering of Gebhardt. Beefing up the (male) singers at the expense of the orchestra: (the singers are from time to time overpowered in the EMI recording which is very natural and certainly approved by Furtwangler). Another very big problem of the recording of Gebhardt is the total lack of descend BASS Sound, which is so richly on the EMI. Siegfried's Funeral March is, like you hear it here on Gebhard, being played in a distorted telephone, really! I have never ever send back materials from Amazon that I bought (100% all historic recordings,/ I am a truly freack and used to the 'old' Mono sounds which sound superbly on my B&W loudspeakers and great Sony Apmlifier). However I may consider to send back this experimental Gebhardt Ring. It is surely an experiment and not yet ripe for commercial use. I am very sorry to write these sentences about a recording (Furtwangler) that is surely a milestone in the history of recording. My advice and warning to all possible buyers: be aware of a very sharp and from time to time distorted sound picture: which does not justify the beefing up of mainly the male singers. And the lack of bass too..
1,I bought this CD for my nephew. Personally, I don't think Axel Rose has a voice. He sings like a cat screeching.
1,Music: 3 stars; compilation: 2 stars; value for the money: 1 star		Last Fall James Taylor released the "Covers" album, which was not all that bad actually. His voice is as good as ever, and JT is one of those people who can take a song, almost ANY song, and make it his own.		Now, a mere 6 months after that album comes this release. "Other Covers" (7 tracks; 26 min.) obviously is a continuation of the "Covers" album. There are a couple of good songs on here, including the Chuck Berry cover "Memphis" and also "Wasn't That a Mighty Storm" (a traditional song). However, the medley "In the Midnight hour/Knock on Wood" is just terrible, in my opinion.		I don't know what to make of this release, though. At 26 min. it's too long to be called an EP (extended play single), and too short to be called an album. So what do we call this then? Also, the official release price is $9.99 (although Amazon sells it for a bit less), which I think is ridiculously overpriced for the amount of music on here. Buyer beware!
1,I love Steven Wilson music, especially P TREE (In Absentia, Stupid Dream, Lightbulb, Deadwing,etc)and Blackfield), but I really don't understand why everybody are reviewing with 5 stars this album. Maybe that people who love Aqualung (the worst album all over the world. Maybe because long songs.	There's only 1 (Postcard) or 2 good songs. A deception, a regression.	SORRY
1,The most beautiful woman in the world is taking a break-ette from judging a talent show to hoist a music album on her swooning public. '3 Words'  but it actually has many words: "I don't need a parachute, baby if I got you. Baby if I got you, I don't need a parachute.." she trills mechanically and the world gasps at the momentousness of it all...	If I was in 'Revelation' mode (I.e: stating the absolute obvious, and ramming it down people's throats like it was insight), I'd cynically suggest, that the most beautiful woman in the world has released a cash-in music album - tidily tying up the latest series of X-Factor and the ferocious oncoming of Christmas - and prudently filled it full of conciliatory noises towards her good-for-nothing footballer husband.	Solid marketing strategy but surely no-ones going to fall for it; surely this time, no-ones going to BITE...!?		Brilliantly, around this time of year, a one-star dismissal of some such or similar creation, not only attracts the usual, all year round belly-aching howling wounded, but it will also summon that psychotically more fearful mistake of nature: 'The Indignant On-Line Christmas Shopper' - a far nastier commenting creature - something akin to the Alligator Snapping Turtle.	These festive frighteners can chill the heart of even the most righteous reviewer when they come cruising. They'll be a-looking for a quick fix to the frosty problem of what to buy their loved ones - and woe betide you if your review doesn't match their bone-idle expectations.	When they receive their music album by the most beautiful woman in the world, they and their spawn will be secretly disappointed; her solo work is plain and oppressive. She's fab and teary when she's championing her disgusting sub-pub turns against the vampire-devil, but she should steer clear of writing/recording herself. Her music album sounds like a hundred other cds released this year by people who - unluckily for them - aren't the most beautiful woman in the world.	Mid-paced, over-produced pop, lined with bits of hip-hop, trance, funk, rock and pretty much everything else proven profitable in the last decade; it's all here on '3 Words' - played by a computer and sung by something not much above a fem-bot.		Not forgetting of course, the handful of sickeningly slushy ballads, one of which the most beautiful woman in the world will bravely release as her attempt at the lucrative Christmas No 1.	I predict 'Heaven:' "My Heaven's with you, you, you. My Heaven's with you, you, you..." or perhaps even 'Make Me Cry:' "Are you trying to make me cry, are you trying to make me cry, are you trying to make me cry, are you trying to make me cry..." Even children will see through this.		The idea of the most beautiful woman in the world stumbling her way through 40-odd minutes of samey, fluttery nonsense is an oddly disturbing one. The risible state of popular music once again unashamedly reveals both its legacy AND its intent for the future - and it's not even pretending to be nice.		Bless her and all that, but she appears to be some sort of figurehead of all-things-blanch-and-corporate in our world, and the REALLY disturbing thing is - and '3 Words' is miserable proof - she doesn't care a jot.		* 1/2 stars
1,If Iron Maiden is the only band you listen to, and you worship them like the 'emperor's new clothes' then you will love this album.  However, if you are intelligent you should be able to realize that there's nothing special here.  Just another cookie-cutter Maiden album.  It's basically just as good as BRAVE NEW WORLD, except now the excitement has worn off that Bruce is back.		'Rainmaker' is an OK song, except the German band Vanden Plas put out a song with the same name on their album, THE GOD THING.  The Vanden Plas song is much better.  The title track is also worthy of being played at concerts, but the band is pretty much running on vapors at this point.  I don't understand why they don't get rid of Janick Gers and start putting out the kind of music we hear on Bruce's solo records.  Is Steve Harris's ego really that big?		I don't even know why I bought this.
1,I have given Cardinology a few runs through and my first reaction to it has held firm -- this is simply not as good as Ryan Adams usual output. It could be the torrential pace of new material over the past few years is simply running out of steam. Either way, while in many ways more original than much of his previous work, Cardinology feels lacking in inspiration. Beyond the relative flatness of the songs, there is the reach for a pop hit in "Magick" -- at first blush the idea of a U2 riff with Ryan Adams lyrics should be pretty cool. Unfortunately, the lyrics are more Bryan than Ryan. Too bad.	My advice to folks who are not familiar with Ryan Adams is to go with "Gold" or "Easy Tiger." Or if you also like the Dead, go with "Cold Roses" which is a great disc with a heavy Grateful Dead influence. For those already familar with these works, you might still want Cardinology, but may end up doing what I have done which is put it aside and get back into those earlier releases.
1,I've decided to rate all of the country music that my wife buys with one-star reviews.  If I sway just one mind away from this horse poop, it will be worth it.
1,the Red Hot Chili Peppers had a moment in the early 90's where they connected with a Hybrid of Pop,Elements of Funk&Hip-Hop flavoring that made them cool for a minute.but they ain't been able to go beyond cliches since about 92/93&have been playing it safe&just repeating the same grooves,&the Production been the same over the past decade. nothing really stands out here. if this were a 8 song single album i might say average&even then that might be too much.
1,I am so much a fan of Brian, the Beach Boys and Disney. I thought this would be wonderful. It's not. It's a big big mistake. You'd have hoped for something charming. Brian sounds like he was forced into doing this and gave little thought into the arrangements. Why, Brian, why?
1,this album is just stanknasty. I was listening to it while working out and kept skipping over songs half way through. Girlfriend, you lost your edge on this album. Maybe you need to get back with jimmy jam and terry lewis. Just because you are showing everybody your new "headlights" on the front cover doesnt mean they will buy your music!
1,My musical interests have changed slightly since "the lonely position of neutral", so I wasn't first in line to get "true parallels". I got it two months after it's release, and when I put it on, I knew i wouldn't like it. The War Is Over and Stronger and two great tracks...if they were done by hoobastank. The rest of the album stucks way worse. all the songs after those first two are awful and sound the same. TLPON was atleast original and had some siganture sound to it, this crap just sounds like every other band out there. Not catchy, not interesting, and the lead singer (kevin, who's a real jerk) sounds way worse than he did on the last record. Not that I like TLPON either, I'd give it maybe 3 stars tops, but it was better than this. BTW, the band broke up last month (well, actually, kevin quit like the loser he is and left two other band members angry and upset with him, which is obvious in their posts on the TC message board) so don't expect any better follow-ups either. I'd sell my copy back, but I'd only get .90 for it, so I think i'll pass. What a waste. Avoid!
1,I bought this record as a curiosity.  I like electronic music of the early 1980s and am always looking for different, more obscure artists to check out.  I also like to try out experimental records. I have a few Kraftwerk and John Foxx LPs and a few odds and ends. I've seen this 1982 release many times and was attracted to the retro cover.  I have one of David Van Tieghem's (who plays percussion here) albums which I thought was OK but nothing spectacular.  I finally decided to give Big Science a try.  Lyrically, it is interesting with intriguing themes and images but, musically, it is not something I want to listen to over and over.  Other experimental albums I have offer enough accessible, melodic and catchy riffs that bring me back to further listens.  This album doesn't offer much in the way of memorable melodies.  The only track I enjoyed on a musical level was "Born, Never Asked" which offers a nice violin part the effect of which reminds me of some of Gary Numan's Telekon tracks.  The rest of the album is made up of spoken word and repetitive riffs that at best are unmemorable and at worst grating.		"From the Air" (4:29)--Mysterious opening jazzed up by the addition of a saxophone.  Spoken word lyrics are of the captain of a plane giving crash instructions to the passengers.	"Big Science"(6:14)--Slow, dark, and quiet track about the building plans of a future big city.  I like the lyrics, especially the line "You know, I think we should put some mountains here.  Otherwise, what are the characters going to fall off of?"	"Sweaters" (2:18)--Annoying number, luckily a short one.  Bagpipe background, with Anderson singing in a kind of Middle Eastern wail and saying "I no longer love the color of your sweaters" and other things.	"Walking & Falling" (2:10)--The words are the best part of this track: "You're walking.  And you don't always realize it, but you're always falling.  With each step, you fall forward slightly and then catch yourself from falling."  Just quiet electronics in the background.  Not much to this track musically.	"Born, Never Asked" (4:56)--Spoken words with not much if any musical accompaniment begin this track which is hard to distinguish from the last track until the violin kicks in.  I really like the violin in this one.  Musically, it is my favorite on this album.  It reminds me of something Gary Numan would put out during his Telekon sessions.		"O Superman (For Massenet)" (8:21)--This track has an annoying "hu hu hu hu hu" background which runs through the entire track--only being spared by it getting quieter and a little less obtrusive as the song progresses.  The words seem to have an anti-industrial/military complex message: "So hold me, Mom, in your long arms, your petrochemical arms, your military arms, in your electronic arms."	"Example #22" (2:59)--Annoying track.  Kooky saxophone, some wailing, German words in parts, whining "No no-no-no-no no no no" at the end.  Not a pleasant listen.	"Let X=X" (3:51)--Very electronic with some robotic sounds covering the spoken words. Then a trombone comes in (odd).	"It Tango" (3:01)--These last two tracks run together so it is very hard to distinguish one from the other.  Both are so unmemorable that I guess it doesn't matter that they are two songs.  This track has quiet electronics, claps, and spoken words which are often "Isn't it just like a woman?"  The last line is "Your eyes.  It's a day's work just looking into them."  Sometimes this album felt like work listening to it.
1,XTC - Nonsuch (1992)		XTC started life as an arty New Wave band. Gradually a softer, syrupy, sometimes saccharine side of XTC developed, culminating in the brilliant, SERGENT PEPPER-esque SKYLARKING. The following album, ORANGES AND LEMONS, dove deeper into the psychedelic well with mixed results. NONSUCH followed, and at 17 tracks could be considered a double album like its predecessor. That saccharine side is fully indulged here, but as far as baroque pop goes, this is really tops. So it's really just a question of taste as to whether or not you will like this album. And, with few exceptions, it offends my sensibilities; I can hardly stand it.		"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead" kicks things off with an infectious big beat and a rockin' pop song. Unfortunately, nothing on the rest of the album rocks like this. Some people who heard the single or saw the video (which got tons of play on MTV) and bought the album felt duped by this bait and switch. Not cool.		Quite frankly, the rest of the album is just too twee, sing-songy and downright wimpy for my tastes. There's undoubtedly some very good pop music on here if you like sweet, super-melodic songs that border on precious and sound like they belong on Sesame Street. One exception is the dreamy "The Ugly Underneath" which does bring back the big drums for at least part of the song. There are snippets of songs that I enjoy, but they're usually ruined by some mushy, cloying melody with lyrics to match. XTC even get preachy on a few songs ("The Smartest Monkeys," "Books Are Burning," "War Dance") and that's not much of a turn-on either. I got this album when it came out and I never listen to it (although I will listen to "Peter Pumpkinhead" whenever it comes on). No doubt there are many XTC fans out there who would poo-poo all over my review, but considering the preachiness, the rampant wimpiness and the bait and switch, I just can't rate NONSUCH any higher than two stars. Although technically very good music, most of it just turns my stomach.		rating: not recommended
1,I don't know what direction these guys are trying to go in. But, i'm certainly not liking it at all. This cd is riddled with soft lullaby's. And, when they decide to get heavy, it becomes the typical noise, fast beats, double bass garbage that has no groove/rhythm....just like every nickel and dime band out there today. Did not like this cd at all.
1,I am not sure what I did with this mediocre music CD...I didn't care for it after I listened to it just ONE time. It isn't horrible, just not what I wanted,
1,Hailed by many as the album of the 90s, S&E is really just a dissonant hodgepodge of subpar musicianship and angsty, overrraught lyrics. It's easy to crown an album and ride a bandwagon, but as the domino effect of fans undulate into a bedlam of uninformed fans, the musical merit is obtusely recognized, and for the most part, unjustified. Regarded as a paternal album in the indie world, S&E is merely a slanted effort at a disenchanted work, rendering a beloved album that garnered immense praise for nothing. Steve Malkmus' drawling lyrics are the first exhumation of Lou Reed's lyrically potent delivery in the 90s. But Lou Reed invented his own style, and his sui generis recordings are still readily available. Try The Velvet Underground or The Pixies for real musical forerunners.
1,I love the album Kenny G, Faith, so I bought this one.		It is most of the stuff on Faith with maybe a few new ones thrown in. I will be very careful in the future when buying recordings ofv all artists.		In addition, there are many Christmas songs Kenny G hasn't recorded. If he wants to appeal to his fanbase he should have made an all new recording. Stuff like this just bugs people, they think they are being swindled by a different pic on the cover.		I don't like it at all.
1,BEFORE SENDING IT TO SOMEONE FOR $10, TRY TAKING THE 1.99 STICKER OFF CASE.
1,This isn't the first collaborations these two make together, but if they were collaborating on singles in the past, this time we are presented by a full album, Fan of a Fan. It's hard to say from the title who's a fan of the fan. Anyways, the subject matter is not original or creative, it's very expected of these two or any other R&B singer nowadays. This album is no different from every other one released, and it Killed the cliches and stereotypes!		Well, Tyga and Chris Brown are here to discuss and introduce us to what R&B and Hip Hop culture is all about today, all those that don't understand them are mother*ckers, all the women they seem to know have great assets and supposedly a nice p*ssy. If that vulgarity isn't enough, we are also reminded that they have money, cars, mansions, b*tches and Marijuana. They are the sh*t, and everyone else is missing out. The ego centric nature of this album is incredibly aggressive and quite unpleasant. I guess if you're looking something motivational to come up from listening to these songs then you will be quite disappointed instead. Chris Brown and Tyga waste no time reminding all of us, that their lives are automatically better because they are famous and have money, not to mention all the other trivial qualities like looks and how good they are in bed?		Okay, so that's what they came up with, but the production on the other hand was good enough to compensate for these awful songs, although the lyrics are atrocious the beats are quite the opposite, they are pleasant almost overshadowing the awful shades these two rappers are trying to throw at anyone who isn't them, which makes the album bearable to listen to at least.		I guess the only people who'll relate to this album's lyrics are the so called hollywood rappers and R&B artists, or maybe young youth who seem to fancy themselves living on the west coast, getting drunk and high because it's cool, and genuinely believe they can get any girl they want if that wasn't true.		In the end this was an album lacking in originality, something that you should listen to as background music for example when you're doing house chores or cleaning it serves a good purpose for that, keep the sound low just enough not to be able to listen to the lyrics clearly and you'll be fine listening to the beats.
1,nice singing,very good musicians but mostly so so songs and especially poor production(typical for mainstream artists of the time) make this album essential only for the diehards.		reminds me of Christopher Cross.
1,I agree with every last thing the previous throrough review cited--Maazel's traversal of both works (and odd coupling) ranges from the frenetic to sludge and all of it ragged and unidiomatic.  Why would DG ever  have wasted vinyl or whatever on this, and what was in the marketing plan  that made people praise it for something it obviously doesn't contain?	But I have to disagree on the recommended alternatives. The  Monteux/Chicago Franck is lumbering, teutonic, wooly and weighty...very  un-Franckish and not at all the seraphic composer the reviewer cites.  It's  in the performance class of Mengelberg, Furtwangler, Ormandy, and Rodzinski  who gave us recorded performances that allow people to hate this  unpretentious and hearfelt work.  For heart-pumping and leonine Franck, try  Paul Paray on Mercury.  The inspired, controlled drive and power of Paray's  performance will ruin you on anyone else: this is the real Franck, the man  of vision and originality who knew what he wanted and knew he was doing  something supremely original. With this you get Paray's stunningly played  and forceful Rachmaninoff No. 2 for your delectation.	Paray also knows  how to do Mendelssohn: his unmatched No. 5 is full of pomp, dignity,  ceremony, stature, and that Paray drama again.  The balance is even better:  a jaw-dropping Midsummer Night's Dream with a Detroit Symphony of  unbelievable virtuosity and an atmosphere of of otherwordliness.  And we're  not done yet: Paray and the DSO throw in a courtly, loving, and humorous  Haydn No. 96 at no extra charge.  What an orchestral marriage this  was!	The other suggestions may have their merits, but none can match  Paray for artistic achievement, sound, and value to the listener.  His  Mercury offerings are the exact opposite of this dreary, drab Maazel issue.
1,Terribly disappointing...  After such great albums as "Black Out" and FF....  These songs lack the catchy phrases and melodies of albums past...
1,there first cd was so much better.  there isn't a duck and run on this cd. and i am bout tired of the song here without you.  but the plus is that when im gone is a hot song. but they get so much unwanted radio time that i wished they didn't have.  i could call them sellouts.  they don't have the good sound that they used to.
1,This chick is about as rock as britney and her songs and auto tuned voice suck just as bad.  Waste of time.
1,What are the NOW compilers thinking??? This songs are very old to include it in a compilation released in October 1998... They are putting songs released in late 1997 (1 year earlier)	1. Together Again - Jackson, Janet (OLD OLD OLD... They must put "Every Time" or "I Get Lonely") (Included on NOW 39 (UK) released in April 1998) 2. As Long as You Love Me - Backstreet Boys (OLD OLD OLD... They must put "All I Have To Give" or they didn't have to put the Backstreet Boys in this collection! Included on NOW 38 (UK/Released in September 1997)) 3. The Way - Fastball (OLD OLD OLD... They didn't have to put Fastball in this collection!(Included on NOW 39 (UK) released in April 1998) 4. Flagpole Sitta - Harvey Danger (N/A) 5. Say You'll Be There - Spice Girls (OLD OLD OLD... This one was released in late 1996! and it was included on NOW 35 (UK)... They must put "Viva Forever") 6. All My Life - K-Ci & JoJo (This one is almost perfect for the release date... Releaseed as a single in The Mid 1998 and included on NOW 40 (UK) Released in August 1998) 7. Never Ever [Single Edit] - All Saints (OLD... Included on NOW 39 (UK) released in April 1998. They must put "Bootie Call", "Lady Marmalade" or "Under The Bridge") 8. If You Could Only See - Tonic (N/A) 9. MMMBop - Hanson (OLD OLD OLD... Included on NOW 37 (UK)released in July 1997. They didn't have to put Hanson on this collection because they didn't release a single around the release date of NOW 1, their last single before this collection was "I Will Come To You" released in early 1998) 10. Zoot Suit Riot - Cherry Poppin' Dadd (n/a) 11. Shorty (You Keep Playin' With My Mind) - Imajin (N/A) 12. Anytime - McKnight, Brian (N/A) 13. Barbie Girl - Aqua (OLD OLD OLD...

Sex & Candy - Marcy Playground (N/A)	WELL, THIS CD IS GOOD AT ALL BECAUSE THE SONGS ARE GREAT BUT THE ALBUM SHOULD BE PERFECT IF THIS WAS RELEASED IN OCTOBER 1997 - MARCH 1998!
1,...there are few artists out there that have received as much unwarranted hype and mass hysteria as James Blunt.		This guy has blown up around the world - even in the U.S., where most British bands and artists are unjustly ignored.  But Blunt actually cracked the Top Ten and already sold 500,000 copies - you want to know how he did it?  By recording a safe, syrupy, and shallow collection of maudlin soft rock ballads designed for "power rotation" on all the Adult Contemporary stations in the country.  He basically took the Coldplay formula and simplified it even more - is this what music has come to, where we are exalting ordinary pop pablum such as this?		On his debut album Back To Bedlam, Blunt doesn't so much sing as he does bawl his way throughout the entire album.  Sad and depressing music can be both powerful and moving in the right hands, but in the case of a hack like Blunt, every single song is a long, drawn-out weepfest.  This guy can make winning the lottery and falling in love sound as if they were the most miserable, depressing experiences a person could ever have.  Here's an idea of what Blunt's unintelligible caterwauling sounds like:		"WAAAAAAHHHHHH - my girlfriend is leaving me!  WAAAAAAHHHHHH - the school bully took my football away!  WAAAAAAHHHHHH - my parents sent me to bed without my milk and cookies!  LIFE ... IS NOT WORTH LIVING ANYMORE!!!"  Awwwwwww, what's poor little Jimmy gonna do?  Don't you worry, you poor baby - all that money coming your way will help you buy a house, some milk and cookies, a football ... and a new girlfriend.		There's easily enough hand-wringing, tearjerking, cry-yourself-to-sleep themes on this album to make this a chick flick lover's dream come true.  But everything here is delivered in such a simplistic, trite and inarticulate manner, that you have to ask yourself what people see in this guy.  Look at the guy, he's got so much going for him between his having the good looks of an actor and a label willing to make him a big star at any cost - what does he have to be all sad and despondent about anyway?  He's nothing special at all - get over it.		In summary: Bland, mundane and completely irrelevant, the best use for James Blunt's debut album would be either as a frisbee, a beverage coaster, or a substitute for a box of tissues.  Instead of buying the album, why not donate the money to the owner of the studio that Back To Bedlam was recorded in - I'll bet Blunt cried so much that it flooded the building and caused equipment damage to the tune of thousands of pounds.  Why embrace bland fluff like this when there's much better music coming out of the UK - check out Kasabian, The Music, Gomez, Arctic Monkeys, Art Brut, Nine Black Alps, Elbow, Embrace, Hard-Fi, Bloc Party, etc.  None of these bands have broken the U.S. mainstream yet, but these bands have put out albums that are far more intelligent and interesting than what you'll hear on Back To Bedlam.
1,I really dislike this CD (Ok, ok she is better then Paulina Rubio in English (Paulina is today's WORST singer, Brittney and Justin included)). There is no heart to this CD, just more dance tracks like JLO does. There are a few singers who can crossover into different genres and still be good: Shania Twain, Shakira, Linda Ronstadt, and of course, Elvis come to mind. Thalia is not on that level, she should do songs with meaning such as "Rosalinda", as opposed to "Another Girl", which could be called "Another Girl SINGER" because there is nothing to differenciate Thalia from anyone else. If anyone who is unfamiliar with Thalia, and wants to listen to her, go get "Arrasando" and enjoy it. PS: You can still love it without understanding Espanol (I don't understand it either), but it is a great listen.
1,Of course Nino Rota's score for the Godfather is superlative, which is what makes this CD such a disappointment. Given that Carmine Coppola is conducting, the renditions are shockingly ersatz; as if the music was being performed by 101 strings orchestra or something. I find the rendition tasteless, alternately infused with muzak and bombast. In my judgment the feel of the music is way off. If you listen to music through a clock radio while doing dishes, fine. But if you are a connoisseur of fine music intelligently and tastefully performed, I don't think you are going to like this CD.
1,The only reason this dude had a deal is because he was on American Idol. He had no business making the finals. There are 20 people who sing better than him who live on my street. Id rather listen to William Hung! At least that is some entertainment!
1,Wow! Can't believe this guy got famous just because of "Right Thurr"! HE SUCKS! I agree, RIGHT THURR is a fair song but this much publicity just cause of ONE song!	Let's get down to the album! the ONLY ONE song i LIKED from this album is "HOLIDAY INN"! Rest has nothing in it!	Can't believe that i just wasted m 15 bucks!	Below are some CDs I would like to recomend INSTEAD of this album:	Grand Champ by DMX	Kings of Crunk by Lil Jon and East side boyz	Get Rich or die tryin' by 50 Cent	Don't buy this one!
1,As we all know, most of The Beatles' original songs were not joint efforts of Lennon/McCartney but were the creations of either one or the other.	That being the case, and the reader understanding that I have nothing against McCartney's output, practically every song Ms. Collins has chosen is a McCartney composition, the exception being "Norwegian Wood".	But the real problem is that Collins has put absolutely nothing distinctive into these covers. She's competently singing the melody, the band is competently playing the chords, but so what? Compare any song on this disc with her version of "In My Life" done forty years ago. Not only was that interpretation well performed but it is a haunting piece of music. There was an attitude she was emoting; there was soul.	Why is she singing "Norwegian Wood"? When John Lennon sings it, you can hear the resignation in his voice, the humor as he recounts the story about an absurd extra-marital affair with some bohemian woman. Ms. Collins sings it simply as a pretty little love song. It reminds me of Bob Dylan's complaint on his second album of how various covers of "Don't Think Twice, It's Alright" were completely missing the point of the song.	She sings the standard McCartney songbook: "Yesterday", "And I Love Her", "Hey Jude", etc. and she does it without putting anything original or of herself into it.	What a cynical record this is.
1,Video was terrible.  Was not a professional rendering of the New York Concert.  Had a lot of blank spots and large white squares.  I sent it back twice. Lee
1,Mediocre.  Boring. Danny Elfman would have scored this right.
1,I used to be into all the poppy 80s hair bands back in the 80s and early 90s, but now that I'm older I wonder what my girl buds and I were thinking.  These guys used to be my favorite, but now I can easily say that time has made some of us wiser.  There are only really two reasons to justify my 2-star rating:  guitarist Andy Timmons and lead vocalist Ted Poley, both of whom are talented and great guys.  Here they are sorely misused in a barrage of songs that went from sort-of cute innuendos on their eponymous debut to outright raunchiness that tries too hard to compete with their former contemporaries like L.A. Guns, Faster Pussycat, etc.  When I first bought Screw It new, I almost changed my mind when looking at the song titles on the back of the jewel case.  "Get Your **** Together?"  "Slipped Her the Big One?"  "Horny S.O.B.?"  A pit formed in my throat, then traveled all the way down and out to the toilet bowl, which is--reflecting heavily on it now--where the majority of the trashy, female debasing lyrics belong.  I know most of those songs are about groupies, but your average female can't really sit too well on a thing like that either.  It shows lack of respect and encourages teenage boys to have the same outlook, and we all know it doesn't take much to get them going in the first place.  What is nerve wracking is that these guys were in their late 20s and obviously knew better than to come off this way by then.  Blame it on the partnership of Bruno Ravel (who is a classically trained cellist) and Steve West who both wrote most of the songs and produced the album.  Living proof that you can't do two things successfully at once, guys?		This could have been a good album, but it's not, except for "I Still Think About You" and "Don't Blame it on Love."  Unforgivable is the silly rap of "Yeah You Want it," but the absolute worst?  It's at the end when they do an acoustic version of "Get Your **** Together" with a bunch of fans, and one irritating girl makes sure she drowns everyone else out.  Shaddup, ya hag!  The majority of the album is chock full of every hair band cliche' out there, and the only thing worse might be Kix, or that shrieking banshee from Slaughter.  At least these guys didn't scream, but they made up for it in cliche'd "whoas" and chanting to predictable arrangements.  Juvenile and sexist doesn't even begin to describe Screw It, but if you still like fart jokes, spraying beverages out of your nose, and lyrics about stacking up women like pancakes, enjoy yourself.  Thank God at least some of us have moved on, including Andy Timmons.  Too bad Ted rejoined the band, because his solo stuff is so much better!
1,Ugh. Will Smith has lost whatever appeal he had a decade ago.		His peak was in 1996 when he let his Fresh Prince TV series become canceled in favor for starring in Independence Day. By 1997 he'd out with a comeback album (Big Willie Style) and the Men in Black movie. But two good singles and a pretty popcorn flick couldn't save his career after the awfulness that was Wild Wild West.		Seen the 'MTV in Africa' show that the channel did to "commemorate" (ahem *exploit*) the beautiful-but-troubled country of Africa? Instead of trying to raise money to eradicate the AIDS disease (which effects a whopping one out of four people in Africa), MTV sent Will Smith over there to perform such braindead songs as "Switch" and "Party Starter" to promote the new MTV channel that all the rich people in Africa are going to get. Are songs like "Party Starter" better than a cure for the rampant disease? MTV says so.		By the way, the title "Lost and Found" must allude to how Will has lost his creative identity and dignity, and has yet to find it again. In short, this album sucks, and so does the heartless marketing campaign behind it.
1,I thought that this album was very boring. Though at rare times it was very good, (closer, piggy, man with a big gun, downward spiral), the rest of this album is just extremely repetitive and boring, in my opinion. Most of the songs sound the same to me. I suppose that you could compare that desciption with KoRn's title album, a lot of them just sound the same. Sure, you can flame me for hating a "Great" album, but i was extremely disappointed.
1,Originally released in 1964, South Of The Border might just be the best album from Herb Alpert and his Tijuana Brass. Most of this album is excellent. It contains such gems as Hello Dolly, Up Cherry Street, Mexican Shuffle, El Presidente, All My Loving and of course, the title track is a classic.		The big problem with this disc is the poor remastering of the low end, bass guitar and kick drum to be specific. The guy who mastered it pushed the low end WAY TOO HARD!!! Listening to this disc under headphones was painful, and painfully oblivious; and even through the speakers it seemed a bit heavy.		Plus, another blown opportunity to give the fans something a little more. The TJB albums (of the sixties) were always around 30 minutes or less. So, why not do what Capitol Records did last year, with the re-release of the Beatles "American" albums. They doubled the length of the CD by using both the MONO and STEREO versions, 24 tracks rather than 12. What a wonderful idea. In particular for elaborate instrumental music such as this. Let the fans hear the version (or mix) they grew up with. Pretty simple, don`t you think.		01. South Of The Border - 10/10	02. The Girl From Ipanema - 9/10	03. Hello, Dolly! - 9/10	04. I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face - 8/10	05. Up Cherry Street - 10/10	06. Mexican Shuffle - 10/10	07. El Presidente - 10/10	08. All My Loving - 10/10	09. Angelito - 10/10	10. Sal'd, Amor y Dinero - 10/10	11. Numero Cinco - 10/10	12. Adi's, Mi Coraz'n - 10/10		This is a fantastic album (often overlooked) and so it gets 5 stars for the music and packaging, but 1 star for the blown opportunity and the poor remastering. So if I'm correct, that equals 3 stars!
1,I wasn't overwhelmed by the first single, I found "Only One" to be a pleasant, but not particularly memorable light Cure song, and the flip side to be most unpleasant.  But this . . . blows.  Both of these songs are an absolute mess of squawking and squeaking without any kind of compelling melody at all.  I didn't even bother to save the rips.		It seems as though "UTS" is the overwhelming favorite of the songs played on the tour (see Y-tube), hopefully that's the next single [No, see the comments or the Chain of Flowers fansite].  But what concerns me is that 3 out of 4 of the first songs are really awful, and somehow Bob didn't know it.  That only happened once before in his career.		It was one of the worst days of my life, standing there in front of my stereo with WMS in my hands, cycling through the songs one after another until the realization that there wasn't one decent song on the entire CD sunk in.  He recovered from that and produced the brilliant Bloodflowers,  but the point is, it's a little late now to lose the muse again, I'm not sure he has time to get it back.  Maybe by some miracle the rest of the CD will be great and these are just wild exceptions?  Then why did he chose to release them first?  I'm filled with dread at this point, not anticipation.
1,Given the number of 5 star reviews here, it's clear that the majority of these people haven't heard the recording by Hugh Bean and Stokowski. Once you do, nothing else will do, unless you are a period performance fan. This cd has the most ridiculous packaging I've seen. All to promote the sexy, come hither looks of Mutter. One would hope for a remotely sexy performance, but it's not to be. I'm literally shocked at the poor intonation and the scraping noises of her violin (especially on Winter, track number 10), it makes my teeth grind. One wonders what the rest of the musicians were thinking when they recorded this. Did they think the scraping sounds were good? The Trondheim Soloists sounds like a second rate group, one that obviously needs more cohesiveness to make their group sound better. They sound under rehearsed and they struggle to keep up with Mutter's pace. Then there's Mutter the conductor. Sure her performance with Karajan was a mess, and he knows how to conduct. So here we have Mutter thinking she can do it better. This is a better performance, but it's still a terrible one. Avoid this and get the one by Stokowski and Hugh Bean.
1,I'm becoming more and more convinced that in the digital age, labels should start advertising on the outer packaging who actually masters the sound on a given album.  This is an otherwise nicely compiled, though incomplete collection (no "Honky Tonk Heroes", for instance) of Waylon's classic era from 1965-1985.  However, thanks to the earless contributions of compilation producer Rob Santos, mastering engineer Elliott Federman, and digital transfers by Mike Hartry, it ends up being nothing more than a desecration of Waylon's legacy.  In short, the sound quality sucks.  There are so many songs on this collection over-modulated to the point of distracting distortion, I lost count.  One example is "Only Daddy..", where especially the right channel clips (distorts) virtually throughout.  The compression is so heavy on songs like "Rainy Day Woman", it sounds like a bad FM broadcast.  The noise reduction is so over-applied on "Luckenbach Texas", it sounds like an mp3.  I'm so tired of spending money and being burned by record companies, I haven't purchased another Waylon compilation to replace this one yet.  But I'm hopeful there's at least one digital collection out there that won't offend my ears.  By the way, the same complaints of lousy sound quality here apply also to the Jerry Reed volume in this series, so it's probably inherent in the entire "RCA Country Legends" series.  At any rate, save your money and avoid this one.
1,Hello, I'm 11, I hate this cd. Thank you for your time. I only listened to 1 song and watched one music video. I felt there was no need to and I was better off stealing candy from the Kwik-E-Mart. Has anyone else noticed the "interesting" dance move those young wanna-be rapper are doing these days? I personally hate it and think NOBODY should look like rubber for the sake of selling albums! He should stop copying people like Bow Wow and Lil Romeo who shuck and find his own sound (oh, wait, he doesn't write or produce his own music so this really isn't HIS cd). All the songs sound the same (I now remember that I saw him on InConcert, I've been trying to forget that), slow, stupid, about the same topic. Moving on, you probably think I don't listen to music or like old bands (nothing against old bands). I personally listen to Eminem, Outkast, Aaliyah, P.O.D., Linkin Park (yea, I know so many people who hate teen pop hate them to, I know they're not origional but I love their music), Alicia Keys (but I do agree she was overhyped) and Enya. PEACE OUT!
1,This is pretty close to being a KISS  low point.		I Bought the Disc because it is KISS ( Mindless fan that I am), but the material just was not up to the 70's standard . If you like the original KISS  material, this is not one to buy, however, it is probably one to get if you need a complete collection, but do not expect  a KISS  album. Hard to see this as rock... and it certainly is not a good hair band album.		Blech
1,The sound quality on Pride was pretty mediocre. Riptide was better but the track selection on some of the bonus tracks was messed up. The 12" mix of I Didn't Mean To Turn You On runs at 4.38min. On this set it is edited down to 4.22min. (why?). Also the 7" and 12" mixes of his biggest hit Addicted To Love are clearly missing ! There's been an on going debate whether his reissues are from the original masters of mp3 sourced. I'm almost convinced that these are mp3s copied onto CDs. Edsel normally does a pretty good job of  reissuing stuff from the past, but these are clearly not one of them.
1,Over the course of her recording career, Tori Amos continues on the downward spiral of horrible albums.  This one is no exception.	The material on this album and what it is supposed to represent is completely naive and insulting to intelligent musick listeners-of whom she is trying to appeal to on this album.	The approach to the songs is anything but interesting...if you like her covers of "Over the Rainbow" and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" stay away from this recording.	In summation, Tori has become obvious.  Obvious by attempting duplicate the successes of one Diamanda Galas-who is by far a more than competant singer and accomplished pianist.  One thing that Tori has still not learned from Ms. Galas, is to take the voice as a serious instrument.  Tori Amos has furthered the sound of marbles-in-her-mouth-while-singing style to the horrid Nth degree.
1,Not at all what I was expecting. Diffent tastes for different folks. I was searching for songs that weren't in the CD...my mistake. Will look for what is right for my taste.
1,I have all of Keith Urban's albums (and his videos).  I even have doubles of all his CDs; one set for the car and a set for the house. I was shocked when I first heard this CD!  What happened to the "country music" superstar????  I, for one, couldn't find him on this CD. And, I am a true fan speaking and I am quite serious about my thoughts on this matter.  I was truly disappointed upon hearing this latest CD.  What I heard wasn't the Keith that was uplifting even when singing about a less than happy event (as on earlier CDs).  I thought I was listening to some		loud, typical rock "singer" who just belts out a song!  I am used to Keith carrying me away down some country road with the top down and the wind, sunlight, and upbeat rhythms reverberating through my head.  All I have from this latest album is one big headache.  Where is the master of the guitar and ganjo?  He's not here!  Where is the virtuoso who wrote the masterpiece, "Clutterbilly?"  He's nowhere to be found on this CD.		A TOTAL DISASTER AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED and a true disappointment.		Keith, go find your roots and what made you the superstar you have become!!!
1,Says one reviewer: "Best compilation (of Sting) yet..."		May be true, but just indicates how BAD the other compilations may be!  Get this: THREE of the man's BIGGEST hits singles--all Top-Ten entries-- from his post-Police solo career aren't included here!		Details:	1985, Fortress Around Your Heart--#8	1987, We'll be Together--#7	1990, All This Time--#5		In another compilation, outrageous omissions.		Suggestion: Get a Greatest Hits Police CD and then buy Fields of Gold, Greatest Hits to 1994.  You STILL won't get more recent hits, but at least this is a legitimate start on the collection.  Not this one.
1,I have been a Tori Amos fan for years. I bought this album a little  skeptical  (I had heard a couple  tracks off of it that were okay), but hopeful. I was disappointed. Tori has a beautiful expressive voice but it just falls flat here. There's not a lot of passion or humor or emotion at all in a lot of the deliveries and that is a shame. The arrangements of older songs didn't add a lot for me. The original songs were pretty good, but didn't really  hit home for me. The whole of the album just felt monotonous and lacking. I would love to hear a seasonal album by Tori Amos again one day. I think she could do a lot with it. But I don't think this is something that lives up to its potential.
1,This album is just awful. In no way are the songs actually songs. No melody, bad songs, and just a really bad album. It's almost as bad as "Nights Like These" or the new Poison the Well CD. Just awful. How the hell can little emo kids listen to this? I like heavy music... not debating this is heavy or not, I'm just saying it's like they put NO effort into ANY songs whatsoever. Waste of money.
1,I love Enya and I have every one of her CD's.  This one is just plain boring.  There is no spark and I have listened to it twice and then I put it away.  I will give it to the next bazaar at the church as I will not be listening to it again.  What a shame.  I didn't even want to play it for my guests at Christmas...  Just plain dreary....
1,This is the sound of fellows making a Cold Album.
1,I thought about just copying and pasting my review of Corporate America... but that would be doing that album a disservice...this is worse.  All the negative reviews are right,  awful production, horrible drum sounds, terrible mix, bad songs.		I have to think the album is a money grab as someone else said.  Unless he is now deaf,  there is no way the man who conceived Boston (the first album that is) could listen to this with any objectivity and not conclude at the very least that it is unfinished.  Regardless of the bad songs....and calling them songs is a stretch...  this album sounds simply awful.		The negative reviews here are telling.  That fans are once again SO disappointed in another lackluster Boston album is only testament to the exceptional quality of the first album.  When you think about it, what has Scholz put out since 1976 that would leave you to believe that the next album will be better than the last?  Boston releases have been in a continual and predictable 37 year decline... we should all ask ourselves why we expect any different.
1,What really fascinates me in the fetishist who think this is the only BS&T that mattered. The reality is Clayton Thomas was a better singer than Kooper could hope to be let alone Steve Katz's lame vocals. Also the band as a band played better behind D.C. Thomas. That being said this album has its moments. Of course the highlights are I Love You More than You'll Ever Know, I Can't Quit Her and House in the Country. Beyond that this album is hit and miss. Anything Katz sings turns pathetic. Why they let the guy sing I'll never know. Something's Goin On is another keeper with a nice jam. My Days Are Numbered starts off with a nice groove but the chorus is really cheesy. Somehow the people that complain avoid D.C. Thomas turning the band Vegas never complain about this chorus. The other highlight is Jim Fieldler's bass playing. Of course the Overture and Underture are cool cause they reference the good songs and as well they sound good musical. After that, you're own your own. I always poo pooed this record and upon listening realize that it has its moments but its very inconsistent. Calling this a masterpiece I'll never understand. The next album w/ D.C. Thomas sounded sonically so much better and tighter. I always think its great to hear such as the clip you can find from Woodstock of D.C. Thomas singing "I Love You More than You'll ever know." A great tune with a far superior singer.
1,"Having A Party", the last album the Pointer Sisters recorded as a quartet (and their last on David Rubinson's Blue Thumb label) before Bonnie's defection to Motown and Ruth-Anita-and-June's decade of pop chart success as a trio, thoroughly disappoints.  By and large, the songs are nondescript and lackluster; and Sam Cooke's pop classic, "Having A Party", is given a perfunctory reading, the vocals all but obscured by canned "party" noise.  This is for Pointer Sisters completists only.  Anyone else will want to use it as a coaster.
1,Let me think of something nice to say about this CD.		...yeah, no.
1,I really really really wanted to like this album.  The Dio version of Black Sabbath produced what is in my opinion one of the all time great heavy metal albums with "Heaven And Hell" back in the 80's.  The rest of the band's catalogue was not as strong, but "Mob Rules" was a good effort and to a lesser extent "Dehumanizer" in the 90's.  So, it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to this reunion album after all these years.  Even in his mid-60's Dio can still sing his ass off and Iommi, Butler and Appice remain top notch metal musicians.  Unfortunately the material here, for the most part, just does not cut the mustard.  The music is mostly slow and plodding, which is not necessarily a bad thing when talking about Sabbath, but here the lack of variety eventually tends to wear the listener down.  Dio's lyrics suffer from problems that have plagued him throughout his career.  He makes big grandiose statements, but in the end they don't really say anything relevant.  He also reverts to clich's that he has used time and time again with songs like "Rock N Roll Angel" and "Follow The Tears".  I have always thought it would have been interesting to let Geezer Butler write some of the lyrics (he was the main lyricist back in the Ozzy era of Sabbath), but unfortunately he is not given a shot at it here.  There are a few good tracks on this disc, and I especially like the single "Bible Black", but overall the album just does not do that much for me.  One of my major disappointments in 2009 and unfortunately Ronnie James Dio's final statement.
1,Nothing new here. BORING.Better off getting Black Swan and Wormhole Wizards. Not even different set of musicans help this. Momentum stopped.
1,This Pooper-scooper Should Have Been Named Death To Metallica!	I told myself I would not buy it. I did not want to hear my beloved pre-Sandman and now hackneyed and out-of-touch Metallica pull out another pooch. But I caved the second day it was on the store shelves. I wanted to listen to the new album with fresh ears and an open mind. But, ah, predictably, Death Metallic opens with the slow beating of a heart- perchance the waning pulse of Metallica's cold-handed-cash-grab attempt-of-an-album. I mean, man, what can you do but listen and just hang your head in sorrow of what was the definitive metal band of all-time turned from Rottweiler to Droopy (not Snoopy but actually that loser Droopy, Google it!) Have they been listening to any of the metal from Europe, Asia, and even South America? These other bands are light years beyond anything so-called Death Metallic. And what a dumb name for an album! I could have crapped out a better one. I'm only at the beginning of the 4th track and I'm already annoyed that I wasted my dough on this now new frisbee for my girlfriend's retarded dogs. Hetfield's lyrics and voice- double yawn! Guitar riffs and solos sounding left over from the cutting floor of the Puppets, Justice, and Black albums- triple yawns all around. Metallica needed to make THE ALBUM, the one that destroyed all comers- north, south, east, west. But what we really have here people...is a failure to communicate. Some bands just don't grow old gracefully. They just plop plop plop along taking your money gleefully knowing they each have their kids' college funds all ready before they even finish kindergarten. Don't waste a dime on this...let it rust in peace while we all listen to sounds from the other side of the globe. Get the new Jorn album "Lonely Are The Brave" or any Primal Fear album. These shalt not disappoint!-David J Newman 9/13/08
1,So Virgin waited a few months and now they come forward with a 'remastered' version of Jump Back. Pathetic. To begin with, the other recently compilation '40 licks' is absolutely better than this one. Second o all, the old 'Jump Back' sounded just fine, so no need to update for a revealing new sound. Third, the new cover art (?) just cannot be compared to the old version. Sorry Virgin, you are not getting my cash this time. How about a best of live stones remastered? Now, that I'd buy.
1,U2 arrogantly send out their very subpar album to millions of people, get $100 million for it, probably donate less than 1% of that to charity, and continue to write songs about how people have to help and love one another.  I wonder what U2 will do with that $100 million?  My guess - although it'd be in their power to use that money to fight starvation and give much needed relief to many people - my guess is they'll pretty much keep every penny of it for themselves.		 Bono continues to lean in close to the camera lens to show how wide and obnoxious he can make his mouth look, and the most corporate and hypocritical band on Earth come together to make an album cover which is the worst album cover of all time.		I guess if people saw how horrible the album cover is, the music inside it might be a relief by comparison.... Not much of a relief.	Oh yeah, I did listen to songs off Songs of Innocence, I didn't just delete it without giving it any chance at all...		I was surprised at how mediocre & bland the songwriting and musicianship is... The best song off the album is Every Breaking Wave - which sounds completely and utterly like a rehash of With or Without You, but not half as good.  I guess considering this is U2, I shouldn't be surprised that it really is overall a horrible album.		Now a lot of U2 fans will retort with comments such as "Must be a tea party reviewer!"  (nope, I hate republicans & conservatives, and voted for Obama twice), or they'll ask, "What music do YOU listen to huh?"  (just so they can insult the bands I listen to as revenge)  Well I'll tell you my taste in music is varied & I listen to everything from the Beatles, to Marvin Gaye, to the Clash, to Miles Davis, and a lot of others.  Now you can have your little revenge and insult one of them.		All the same...		Horrible music, horrible band, horrible frontman, delusional fans.
1,Never liked much of Led Zeppelin's music but love Robert Plant and Alison Krauss.	Compared to this even LZ sounds good to me.	It's just too slow, like Perry Como.	Good indicator is that you can buy a used cd for $2.15	Listen before you buy.
1,BRITNEY: THE VIDEOS is misleading. There are exactly 3.. yes 3 music videos TOTAL on here. They are: "don't let me be the last to know", "I'm a slave 4 u", and an alternate "I'm not a girl, not yet a woman." The rest of it consists of a photo shoot?! That's right, Britney taking cute photo's while "anticipating" plays in the background. Was that necessary?! Even worse, it also includes her pepsi commerical. To me, this was a complete waste. The record company could've put together  a real video collection with all of Britney's videos. BRITNEY: THE VIDEOS also includes a sneak peak at her new movie CROSSROADS and also the MTV performance of "I'm a slave 4 u".
1,Never again.  After And Justice for All, the band has gone down hill.  Hetfield looks strung out, sounds like garbage and can not hold a note.  This release, while better than St. Anger (which totally ripped off the fan base) is classic junk.  Now they will tour, aske $125 per ticket and rely on the older music to get them by.		Burton is turning over in his grave.
1,With all due respect to other reviewers who remember this record fondly, I recommend that others steer clear of "Love Byrd".  What's wrong with it?  Well, Donald Byrd is here as the featured performer with Isaac Hayes producing, playing, and writing circa 1981.  Sounds like a great idea.  In truth, I've never heard Byrd or Hayes associated with anything this misguided and generic.  Byrd's trumpet is absent from most of the proceedings.  Isaac's songs meander and repeat, without any fully fleshed ideas or soloing to keep them interesting.  "Love Has Come Around" is such generic disco at least 2 years past the fashion that you would never guess that Byrd or Hayes were playing on it.  The discofied "Love For Sale" also turns out terribly.  The slow songs fare better, and you can even hear a bit of Byrd's soloing and Isaac's singing (on "Falling").		I love both these guys, so I'm going to chalk this up to a bad day.  Byrd and Hayes were doing much finer things in this period that merged jazz/pop/disco in more personal ways that coalesced better.		Instead of buying "Love Byrd", I recommend "The Best Of Donald Byrd" (with the Al Hirschfeld caricature on the cover) and Isaac Hayes "The Best Of The Polydor Years".  Both are great.  "Love Byrd" just went terribly wrong somewhere.
1,Upon first seeing my review, you noticed only two stars.  Before I explain my feelings on the album, I want to state that Toto is one of my favorite bands.  I own all of their studio albums and there are only two that I'd give two stars, "Turn Back" being one of them.		I'm not sure if David Paich, the main songwriter on the album, was running out of ideas, but this album is extremely lackluster.  Melodies are sterile, repetitive, and underdeveloped.  Musically, the album tends to sound the same - all are straight-forward rockers with the exception of two ballads.  Had I not been spoiled with the diversity on albums like "Toto IV," "Hydra," and "The Seventh One," I probably wouldn't think twice.  Those albums are far superior in the songwriting and arrangements than what's on "Turn Back."  It's kinda strange, but the best albums seem to have a sword on the front.		Then there's the lame lyrics ("I Think I Could Stand You Forever"), not to mention repetitiveness in songs like "A Million Miles Away" - the phrase "I don't want to know" is repeated nine times! That's acceptable for a chorus, but becomes real old when it's a verse.		My final criticism is that there's only eight songs on the album - not much to choose from.  However, on the flip side, that seemed to be par for course during the eighties.		Okay, so I ripped the album apart.  What's good - the instrumental sections.  As always, Toto shines here and is why I've been committed to this group over the last twenty years.  They are phenomenal musicians, not to mention technical virtuosos.  (I wish I could play jazz piano live David Paich.  He's good!) Though I'm not impressed with "English Eyes," the instrumental in the middle and end are worth noting.  The bestsong, both for melodic and chord development is "Turn Back."  Great driving rock and cool synth support.		If you're new to Toto, I would suggest some of the others I listed above.  On the other hand, if you're a fan like me, you gotta have it to complete the collection.  Please remember, this is just my opinion and we all have different tastes.  Listen to the pieces with a critical ear and come up with your own conclusions.
1,...and some it had me begging for original material; especially not needed was the TFF song, which was played to death in the 80's and I certainly didn't welcome hearing it again. Good try, nonetheless. My favorite track has to be "Changing of the Guards". Patti brings her superb style to it and is essential listening. "Within You Without You" also is done justice. All in all, a nice side project but this only serves to whet the appetite for all-new stuff from Patti.
1,You know, I seriously can't understand why the indie hipsters and elitists pick on the perfectly good White Stripes (victims of hype, but good FUN rock nonetheless) when a band as unforgivably crappy as The Darkness lurks out there.		 Irony is being seriously abused in the world of indie rock these days, but The Darkness take it to an all-time low. "Ever wanted to relive the days of '80s hairspray poof-rock? Well here's your chance!!" Good Lord, this is AWFUL. Justin Hawkins' silly falsetto makes me want to break things, especially copies of this album, and the AOR guitar solos were stupid 20 years ago and even worse now, especially since we're supposed to know better. The first time I heard I Believe In A Thing Called Love, I so wanted to wish it was all a joke. But then I realized, Spinal Tap already exists. Even if it IS a joke, it's a parody of a parody of a self-parody. Simply unacceptable.		 The hype machine has settled on something truly abominable this time 'round. Hope everybody gets sick of this...this MONSTROSITY soon and finds music that is worth supporting. The fact that The Darkness are being touted as an acceptable alternative to Nickelback is just depressing.
1,You've not released a good album since 1993!		Crappola after crappola is what each new release is. Lame, lame, lame.
1,straight up i hve always been a fan of Raphael Saadiq's Production and instrumentation talents, but problem for me has been his vocals and his solo work which for me ain't seeing his better days as a Member of tony, toni,tone. this album is the bandwagon jump on 60's style era Motown,stax,etc... and while it is charming a few listenings it gets old real fast and it makes Saadiq sound like a Lounge act covering songs as to having a idenity on them. he seems to be chasing a trend as to doing his own thing. he is a talented artist, but I never have felt him fully as a solo artist and this album falls after the half way point to me.
1,Lots of beautiful moments, but they are buried in an avalanche of new melodies. I think the album would have benefitted by Jon recording with the band together, and with a STRONG producer to eliminate some of the diversions here and there. Still, definitely worth a listen if the samples are your cup of tea.  Jon's singing is good, and the playing is top notch.
1,There's original music-and then's there more of the same.  This is more of the same.  Just like Kings of Leon, take some guys, put them in a room with old records like the CLASH (I hear London Calling right now in track 10), Led Zep (track 11-I hear Heartbreaker now).  I know the critics love this one-but remember two things-first, they get the music free-not having to pay for it like us, and secondly, it's "wilding", one critic goes wild about the next new thing and the others follow-just like a pack of schoolkids.  Why do I even read their reviews?  As for the others here, how do I explain them-I don't. It's somewhat like hearing and liking what others tell you to like.  Think for yourself and buy something else, like Ray Davies.  I'm close to the end of listening to this disk for the third time.  Now, I dislike it more than before and have gone from two stars back to one star because I can't do zero stars.
1,The sound engineer ruined what could have been some cool tunes. The recordings sound like your listening through a 1/2" speaker. Boo-hoo for this blues project.
1,This is possibly the most well-known CD from Heather Nova...her music has become familiar on the sountracks of many of the teen dramas that saturate the TV.  That captures the essence of her music, teen angst...though better written then most.  The music is beautiful, the use of cello is a bonus, but the CD is uneven and all over.  Heather Nova is much better when seen live, avoid the studio produced CDs.
1,(2 & 1/2 stars) In my youth Chicago was one of my very favorite bands - in the top 2 or 3 for sure.  When I played trumpet back then, I even had the trumpet parts memorized from songs like "Questions 67 and 68."  I even enjoyed their more "lite rock" phase of the '80s.  But all of that was then and this is now.  Their new "XXX" is not so hot.  The main problem is epitomized by the 2nd track on the CD, "King of Might Have Been."  It's a mildly pretty ballad along the lines of "You're The Inspiration."  The big obvious differences are in the current talent then versus now.  "Inspiration" featured the winning vocals of Peter Cetera (no longer in the band); "King" has the merely competent Jason Scheff singing.  The new song was produced and arranged by Jay DeMarcus (who?); "Inspiration" was filled with shimmering, subtle and beautiful touches created by the incomparable David Foster.  "King" is a very ordinary and unmemorable tune; "Inspiration" is a classic that was co-written by Cetera and Foster.  And that example pretty much represents what happens on the album as a whole.  It's undoubtedly unfair to compare this new CD to Chicago's glory days, but the fact remains that it's a pale imitation.		A couple of thoughts regarding the CD's title.  First, the album count has gotten shakier over the years.  I don't think that every regurgitated and repackaged collection (ex., "Chicago Love Songs") should count toward the total.  So really they are nowhere near 30 albums.  Second, the movie rating implications of "XXX" seem to have completely escaped them, as there is no mention of anything relating to that in the album booklet or art.
1,She is one of the most overhyped and overrated singers in all of music history. She is mediocre at best and probably does not even write her own lyrics. All of the songs are boring and her squeals annoy the hell out of me. Most of her songs are sampled off of other artists so that shows how original she is. She obviously cant make an album on her own so she collaborates with other people like most rappers out today. I would not recommend this unoriginal music to any fan of real music. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!
1,I am a Beyonce fan...scratch that..WAS. This was a complete downgrade from her past efforts. The majority of the songs were very bland and all too similar..especially the Beyonce disc while the "Sasha Fierce" was filled with a lot of songs with strong beats and lackluster substance. I could go and on but I'd rather you see for yourself. Preview the album before handing over your$9.99 or $12.99. I don't understand the purpose of putting out two cds. I mean who wouldn't buy the Deluxe and not the Standard. Come on now. Its obvious this was simply a ploy to make more money. Certainly not off of me.		Enjoy...HA!
1,As good as he is, Pape cannot compare with Hotter, London, or several others in this music, sorry.
1,record has lots of Static and the hole in the middle of both records is not round??? my audio equipment  is only two weeks old so it's not that.	sending back and will leave review at  5 stars tell adequate time has been given to fix the issue	update: received new record it sounds the same and the record has center hole that is not round and dosn't track in a circular pattern on my player and has a large edge burr you can get cut from if your not careful		the second record(side 3 & 4)  sounds better than the first but still has issues with a center hole out of round	love the music!!! just wish  the record was round and static free		Projet Debut Carbon	cambridge audio cp1
1,Bought ENIGMA "Seven Lives Many Faces" (2008) CD and placed the CD into my computer and got an AVG Anti-Virus program warning that it found a Trojan Horse Downloader. Generic8. BGR in the CD's EnigmaStarter.exe. This rating is only about the Capitol Records' part of it, not the artist's.		For the artist's part I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. How many artists can create super hit albums year after year? Not many if at all. Be realistic.
1,This is an album of already released un-released Parliament tracks (mostly from their album Osmium) with terrible music thrown in from some other fake funk group. This is a FAKE George Clinton album!
1,Sharissa kinda reminds me of Lil Mo a bit.might be better suited as a Hook chick.but there are some cool Jams here including "In Love with a thug" with R.Kelly which is Hot Grits&Gravy Soulful.that song alone is worth the Price. R.kelly Sings this Song Like Smoke coming off a BAR B Que Pit.this is FIRE!!!! Sharissa got a nice range,but I can't see Her making it as a Album Artist. the Album aside from "In Love with a Thug",&I Got Love is slightly better than Average.
1,With Back Home, Eric Clapton has released an easy listening album.  The question is, why would anyone listen to Eric Clapton for sappy pop music?  His talent is his guitar, not his voice - if I wanted pop, I would listen to Paul McCartney.  Eric's voice is okay, but not great, and while there are a few decent guitar riffs here, it doesn't compare to his better CDs in any way.		I know that Clapton has nothing against pop.  He's played with every one of the Beatles at concerts, and is featured on George Harrison's solo albums with George and Ringo.  However, he can't sing a pop song like George can, and on this CD he doesn't play the guitar as well as George and Eric did on their classic collaborations like While my Guitar Gently Weeps and Badge.		I hope his next studio CD is a Cream re-union album like the recent Cream re-union concert.  Perhaps going back to playing the guitar while Jack Bruce sings and plays bass will get him out of this rut.
1,The original Star Wars scores have been released four separate times already, and yet all they get is a remastering?  What kind of garbage is that?!  George Lucas pours huge amounts of money into restoring and unecessarily adding to the original films, but he won't spend a little bit more for the one, most important element that actually made each of those films exciting.  Instead, he offers gimmicks.  Who cares about new packaging, which sucks by the way, and ooooooh!, screensavers!, I'm gonna run out and spend $55 dollars, so I can own those never before released  screensavers and forget all about the fact that, once again, John Williams' treasures have been robbed of a proper treatment.  Nothing but disrespect for the man who single handedly brought orchestral film scores back from the dead. Shame on George and shame on Sony for such half ass work.
1,The music itself is actually very good but I find the singers voice to be very whiny and uninteresting.  The lyrics are horrible.  The subject matter as well is very typical teen angsty.  I find the verse of Kind of Perfect to be possibly the biggest adulteration of the metaphor...ever.  However, I have found tracks 2-4 to be bearable.  I just don't see this as anything special.  I think if they dropped the lead singer Armor for Sleep would have a much brighter (in both senses of term) future.
1,This is one of those sacred cows of the gramophone, which on reissue proves to be something of a disappointment. I'm afraid that while it was probably competitive when it first appeared, it has simply been surpassed in terms of both performance and recording.	The playing is fine, and the mono recording OK-ish for the mid-fifties, but Sanderling's interpretation (not to mention the cuts) make this hardly recommendable.	....
1,wasn't my type of musical entertainment.
1,I don't know if Linda Perry was fully ok during the making of this record, because it feels like it is all over the place. It's boring, terrible vocals, one or two songs get away with it but the album continues to sink in its own boredom-Casio sounds.		If you wanna buy it, DON'T. Just buy these songs:	1. One Word	2. Suburbia	3. Don't Touch Me When I'm Sleeping
1,im not going to waste anymore time writing about this horrible album by the horrible band...... it just sucks
1,Too much talk between songs...  But that's just me..
1,Something VERY wrong with the manufacturing of these CD's....Sounded awful.
1,Received an empty case. No CD inside. Can not review the CD, but the case is pretty.		John Fields	jfieldssr@att.ner
1,I love Scale the Summit, Spastic Ink, Intervals, Pomegranate Tiger, and other djenty/proggy/shreddy instrumental stuff, so you'd think I'd like AAL too.  I own the first AAL album and I've heard clips of this one.  Unfortunately I find virtually everything they've done to be immediately and completely unappealing (sounding like the output of a random note generator rather than like musicians playing what I'd recognize to be "songs").  I don't (at all) understand the enthusiasm for this band that other people are showing here.
1,This album reminds me of when, in the late 60s, Sammy Davis Jr. or Dean Martin would go on TV, wearing love beads and flowers, their hands dancing with faux LSD moves. It was so contrived, it was funny in the most unintentional ways. Several points arise:		1-This is the worst Sgt. Pepperploxtation I know of. Neon Philharmonic take the worst psudo-psycadellia, and the worst soft rock mush, and put them together, making the horridness of the music actually grow expadentially.		2-Everything here is over-the-top and brash. The strings, horns, and vocals are all interesting in theroy, but it is as if one of the Texes hicks in Easy Rider got a copy of Forever Changes and decided to cut a record in a very expensiVe drug store booth.		3-The singer can't sing, and much worse, THINKS HE CAN!		But definately buy this. It is so bad, you need to have it, just for novalty value. (I remember being at a party completely sober and rolling on the ground laughing at this.)  Everytime you buy a new CD of any genre, you'll be able to take this out, knowing your new purchace will be comparatively better.
1,This album has been getting mixed reviews since the day it dropped, and I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about. After listening to the album, I decided that this was an album that the music world could have done without.	It's not to say that Michael Jackson doesn't show much talent on here (vocally, he's on point for most of the album), but let's think about something for a minute. This is his first album of all new material since 1992's Dangerous, and it seems like during that time, Michael forgot just what formula he used to make fans pay attention. So he made a very common mistake: he went with what was trendy.	First of all, most of the album is produced by Rodney Jerkins and Teddy Riley, so you already know where things are going. You might wear out your fast-forward button from the first three songs alone. Then several songs feature 1997-flavored rapping by someone named Fats, who starts off every one of his raps with "uh, uh, uh" (*sigh*). And "Unbreakable" is one of those annoying instances where someone thought it would be a good idea to insert a vaulted Biggie rap into the song. (For an AUTHENTIC Jackson/Biggie song, check out "This Time Around" off Michael's HIStory album.) Also, I don't know how Tyrese's "2000 Watts" got on this album, but Teddy Riley and Michael reworked it, and Michael is singing the verses in a very odd low-pitched voice. And "Privacy", which is about the paparazzi getting all up in his business, sounds like a bad remix of "Dirty Diana".	Some of the slow songs don't even work that well. Babyface's "You Are My Life" is too sappy for comment, and "Break Of Dawn" has lyrics like "Love me more/Never leave me alone by house of love." (What does THAT mean?) Songs like these are so disappointing that it may make you not be able to tolerate the obligatory we-are-the-world songs "The Lost Children" and the R. Kelly-penned "Cry".	Truthfully, the only really good songs on this album are "Butterflies" (which took a while to grow on me), "Don't Walk Away" and "You Rock My World". I guess Michael wanted to give us a lot of new stuff because it's been a while, but this album just doesn't cut it. Also, I guess he's still in the double-album persona because this album clocks in at 77 minutes. Invincible? He was until this album came out.
1,Literally every single review listed here gave this CD an abysmal review and said it sincerely sucked (it does), yet each one has 4 stars by it. What's up with that, Amazon web master? I don't think that many reviewers could be that dumb, do you?
1,Foals used to be good.. solid guitars, awesome music.	What happened???	The last album was contrived and annoying, this is just a compilation of other peoples terrible songs.		you might like this if you visit northern European nightclubs and you have a time machine to go back to 2002.
1,I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums.	Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.		But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums.	With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
1,In my 15+ years of listening and buying this bands albums I can not for the life of me understand peoples ethusiasm for this record.	Counterparts seemed to be a welcome change as the band dropped more of its keyboarding sound, and Alex started to do more riff rocking guitar action.  Don't get me wrong, Alex and Geddy do some decent grooving on this album, but there was a big problem.  And it is the biggest problem on the album.	That problem was Niel.  Niel Peart who is considered probably one of the best drummers who ever lived, fails to live up to his impressive playing on this album.  Basicaly Niel's drumming on this album is predictable and borish.  There are no fancy rolls, or intricate beats or anything to get you moving.  In fact everything I think is 4/4.  But the worse was yet to come.	Niel who is the principal lyricist for the band, has penned his WORST lyrics ever (yes worse than Caress of Steel).  Songs are peppered with incredibly CHEESEY lyrics, and many of the songs just reak (Nobody's Hero, Everyday Glory), sound stupid (Between Sun & Moon), have stupid song breaks that kill the momentum (Cut To the Chase, Double Agent), or are just titled idioticly (Speed of Love).  He really dropped the ball on this one, and Geddy's vocals come in at the most weird tonnes, and awkward places making everything 10 times worse.  No don't get me wrong, a song about AIDS is great as long as it's done well.  However Nobody's Hero is just the most corniest, cheesiest, weepeist, sachrinst thing I have ever heard.  Never mind the exhausting outro string section that's beaten over your head to death...	Let's look at some more lyrical cheese shall we:	"For You and Me; sex is not a competition	For You and Me; sex is not a job description"	-Alien Shore	"AHhha ha to yes why the sun?"	-Between Sun and Moon	It was just before sunrise	When we started on traditional roles	She said sure, I'll be your partner	But don't make too many demands	-Cold Fire	What kind of lyric are these?  I even heard them play Sun And Moon live and it was horrid!  It's amazing the lyrics Niel has penned and the worlds and moods he's created and this was what he came up with.  It boggles my mind...  They don't even sound jocular or humourous even...	This is without a doubt the bands WORST album they ever made (at least so far).  I even say it's worse than Caress of Steel because at least with that recording they 1) tried something creative and imaginative 2) were pressured to get the record out before they were even ready.	Only buy this album if you are a huge fan of the band and need to complete your library.  THat being said make sure it is the LAST Rush album you buy.  If anything go out and get the next album they released after this album 'Test For Echo'.  That album is basicaly what Counterparts would sound like if they did it right, it blows this album out of the water!
1,John Reuben burst onto the hip-hop scene with his debut album on Gotee Records in 1999. His original style and witty lyrics hooked thousands of fans from around the world, many of which will more than likely be scratching their head's when they pick up John's second release, Hindsight. If you have seen John in concert, then you know that his personality is pretty wacky. He's a funny guy and likes to play it up on stage, but unfortunatly, he brought some of his antics into the studio, and the result is pretty chaotic. It's evident from the beginning that while Reuben has certainly worked hard to master his craft, he doesn't take himself too seriously. Some say that's a good thing, but while I listen to John's hooping and hollaring and "funny" readings from his journal, one has to wonder how many late night recording sessions went way too late. There are some good tracks on the record including "I John Reu" and "Doin'," but most of the tracks seem disoriented and uncreative. It's almost as if he took a complete 180 degree turn from his debut. John almost seems to play into his own "new" style on the song "Doin" by saying "if you buy it and don't like it / feel free not to listen / i'm not sure about a refund / but you're welcome to diss it." He also says on "I John Reu," "this record won't ever sell a million." I think John has major potential to break out to the status of even tobyMac. He has great performace and mic skills, but it's almost like Hindsight was at half effort. Someone needs to pull the reins on John's creativity and intervene if he's going to continue releasing records. I give this album a C-. -Kevin For TSRocks.com
1,The two best things about this album are the lovely cover picture and the fine recorded sound.  The playing is mostly amateur.  The lead guitar has some ability but the other three are playing simply and without any flair or dexterity or professional agility whatsoever.  The pieces are all slow and I cannot believe four guitars are actually playing as any TWO professional classical guitarists would be able to play these easy arrangements at sight.  The four here must each be playing just one note at a time.  Yes the songs sound gentle and relaxing but my first year students could have played three of these guitars as well as these guitarists.  The one piece with some interest is the final track of the Arcangelo Corelli Christmas Concerto, which isn't even credited to Corelli on the CD which states "All songs traditional".  Skip this unless you have no appreciation of really good classical guitar and just want background Christmas music.
1,I bought this album without even thinking twice about it. I love Gwen and everything she's done with No Doubt. I love her lyrics especially. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed with this CD. I listened to it once and couldn't believe my ears. I can't believe this is the same person. It's her voice, but someone else's soul. This CD gets one star, but only because it's Gwen. I know she's the one responsible for this (trash), but she still kicks a** and I know someday she'll come out with something worth listening to. Oh- and I'm giving this CD away.
1,Just a kind warning, if you buy this cd it is Tommy and the boys minus their biggest characteristic, synthesizers. No wonder the price is so cheap, I thought I was just getting a good deal instead of a good screwing.
1,Perhaps my expectations were so high because my prior Scorpions purchases before this have been Humanity just recently in 2008, and only Crazy World (Great album!!)in 1990 when it first came out.  I guess this album had a lot to live up to.  I've always loved the Scorps but just haven't been following them closely.  "Unbreakable" shows their hard side, yes, but it's not as creative or artistic as many of their other albums, which is what I truly like them for.  If you're a die hard Scorps fan, you'll want this for your collection.  Otherwise, just download a couple songs like "My Generation", "Maybe I, Maybe You", and perhaps even "Through My Eyes", and you'll have the best songs on the CD.  This one just didn't appeal to me as much as the others I've purchased.
1,Gave it away. Usually love these 2 but this one fell short.
1,There are two things wrong with this album that are completely unacceptable, the primary one being this:		The final track is not Lewis Black. That's not his voice. I've listened to almost everything he's ever done on both audio CD, DVD, even Comedy Central specials and some cameos in other media. I think I can recognize his voice by now.		No, there is no conclusion. It ends with someone trying to sound like him giving the audience a fake--literally, fake--goodbye. It's not him, go listen to it.		Now, as for the material itself, half of it is recycled. All of it is of absurdly poor audio quality. You have to really hear it to believe it, because it truly is horrific.		The half of the material I haven't heard before is actually good, even if it's old. The Dan Quayle skit is a riot, as is all the stuff about the stealth bomber and a myriad of other political issues from about 25 years ago, easily.		But the age doesn't bother me, because I still think The White Album and The End of the Universe are, without question, his best works. As time went on, he was still good, but his prime was when he first was starting out. Nothing, absolutely nothing, beats the second-half of The White Album. From the Heaven's Gate cult skit onward, even my other favorite comedians, like Dave Attell, Mitch Hedberg, Jerry Seinfeld, and Jimmy Carr, that's the best of the best of any of them.		Really, I can't recommend this due to the recycled and ultra-poor-quality audio, and the astonishing final track that is someone imitating him because, I don't know, they didn't record the end of the thing?		Stay away, even if you're a Lewis Black fan. I'm listening to it on Sony Music Unlimited, so I listened to it through that subscription service on my Nexus 7. But I wouldn't buy this on CD for the terrible carelessness of the production, as well as the outright deception that this is new material, or even professionally-recorded material.
1,I can't believe this album. I was expecting it to be up to the high standards set by their previous release No Strings Attached but this just sounds like disposable pop. There is no cohesive theme, just "I want you back girl" and "I'm a put upon pop star". When are they going to release their Seargent Pepper or their Blonde on Blonde? I was expecting more from the guys. I thought we had the new Beatles on our hands but now it looks like they may be just another Osmonds.
1,Being a die hard Tull fan, and after just seeing their tour pass throught New York, I was excited to see all the 5 star reviews for the CD.  So, I went and picked this CD up immediately. How disappointing. The India influence was refreshing to hear, however, his lyrics have no direction and the music is scattered at best.  Tull, known for scattering his music and putting it together again beautifully, on this CD forgets to put it together. Has he ran out of important statements to say to us??
1,So far this album that I ran and got proves my theory that any Hip-Hop artist starts from good to okay. T.I. is one of my favorite ATL rappers so far, and the reason I'm throwing in this Review is because I've notice that since he started his album ratings keep droping one at a time, going from 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, and eventually this might drop because of my rating.		  This album deserves 3.5 because of he's lyrics dropping no type of energy.
1,They have milked the irish background thing a little to much (so they are irish, big deal so am I, doesnt mean I have to like Celtic music for "ethnic awareness") and their sound has just gotten so ridiculously silly too... they sound like the Sex Pistols when they did that joke pirate song "friggin in the riggin" accept these guys take it seriously and so do their fans...	plus all the right wing banter/patriotism/skinhead etc. is just dumb and makes the music even less enjoyable...	I gues this just proves that being a proud "irish american" is basically trying to side step the "boring white american" category you belong in...
1,Just confirms a long held belief I had the the early and mid 1970s was not that great for hard guitar rock. Grace should have recorded in NYC with some younger rock guitarists in the early 1970s, this is a little too dull for me but I do loves Grace's voice here.
1,the clive davis project and its very bland and off. Aretha Franklin sounds decent though she doesn't sound motivated and hungry. the material here just feels like decent background music at your local starbucks. a few cuts are alright, however on a whole i would rather hear some original material. nothing memorable here. i could never have seen Aretha doing this kind of album back in the day. she is better than this project.
1,Uncle Kracker is the perfect example of a musical artist that has his connections to thank for him having a career - suffice to say, if it wasn't for Kid Rock, Kracker would be just your token DJ in a band, or maybe even serving up crawfish at a restaurant near you.  Nothing that we have ever heard from has warranted the attention or radio airplay that he has received - the songs are all as soulless and vapid as his recording pseudonym suggests.	Kracker's debut album, Double Wide, basically presented him as a kinder, gentler Kid Rock - "comin' straight at ya from the Detroit trailer park, y'all", but less likely to raise hell, and you could take him home to meet your mother.  That album did have a ubiquitous hit in "Follow Me" (which differed greatly from the rest of DW) and, not surprisingly, Kracker follows in the grand tradition of other lifeless corporate pop acts (Sugar Ray, Smash Mouth) and desperately tries to duplicate the sound of his past hit on the follow-up, No Stranger To Shame.	This album plants Kracker squarely in the realm of adult contemporary - everything here is tailor-made for the "listen at work" stations, but there is nothing redeeming at all about any of the songs here.  Kracker had to resort to releasing a cover ("Drift Away") in a bid for radio play - it worked for him, but the fact that Dobie Gray sings circles around him casts a dark shadow on Kracker ... it was obvious that he couldn't carry the song on his own.  If you like music that plays it safe, there's plenty for you to chew on here, but nothing artistically relevant or profound to speak of, and Kracker's trite lyrics and toneless voice certainly doesn't help any.  Only on a couple of songs does the old Kracker rear his head, and as you would expect he comes off as Kid Rock's harmless little brother - maybe the Kid's buddies with him because Kracker's a performer that actually makes him look good.	In summary: Trivial pap from an unchallenging, irrelevant artist - more or less just music to nod your head to mindlessly.  Appealing only because it's inoffensive fluff to play in the office, I can't recommend this to serious music fans.
1,Angst when you're over 30 years old isn't cool, it's pitiful. Grow the f*ck up.		This album lacks any punch and those moments when it comes close fade away once an insipid lyric is attached. "We Are All On Drugs" is not tongue-in-cheek, is not ironic and borders on an earnestness that's almost Mormon--meaning, it's a lame tune. The rhyme scheme along pisses me off. The radio track "Beverly Hills" is non-threatening and sing-along (file "The Damage in Your Heart" here as well). "Perfect Situation" opens as a Weezer tune that sounds like it's a third-rate rip-off of a Weezer tune. And the 'ballad' tracks reek of psuedo-sentiment, like some Oprahish memoir.		Is this what Weezer aspires to? It's just not what you want to hear from these guys. Make Believe sounds like a soundtrack album to a Kristin Dunst movie or a WB teen-drama, if you're into that love this album up.
1,Big fan of primal, but not use to hearing this raw sound. Way too distant from their other creative sounds.
1,Actually I am a pop & rock fun. I like black music from 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. From musical point of view, I don't like hiphop or rap, except some songs, like The message (GMF). Nothing Special.
1,: don't get this dvd; it has lousy sound q. only bad thing about this is u cant hear pete townsends guitar. even best buy employees tested it & said: yeah-lousy sound q. how can this b? vs. others reviews ive seen here about its sound. also, i wanna hear the who do the song called "DOGS".
1,For Christ's sake !  THis band, one of my all-times favourites, practically finished after the album "SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON" !  THe only good point in this live CD is that at least there  are only songs from the albuns recorded before that!  But the mixing is  absurdly poor, the band is playing lkike if they don't care.
1,I heard this album a few times on NPR's album preview site and sad to say this is the first Flaming Lips album I will not pick up. I am certainly one to appreciate a band taking some risks and delving into some different terrain, but with this album I think that is only half the case. Basically I think they just got lazy. The lack of effort put into the construction of this music is quite noticeable. The Pink Floyd/Can/AstroKraut thing is for one, best left to it's progenitors, and is also certainly not the best use of their talents. If anything, it's a jam album, and a fairly boring and uninteresting one at that. Wayne and Steven are born pop songwriters, and it's these talents that make us or anybody love the Flaming Lips at it's essential core. Sure we love them for their weirdness too, but when they ditch the pop song-loving crowd for the stoner crowd, and Phish devotees or expatriots, their fairly devoted fan-base may go looking elsewhere for quality product. If you think this album is at all interesting then go check out some Spacemen 3 and Can records and forget about this one.
1,I can understand why Dr. No and From Russia With Love might not have any new music because the original soundtracks are jammed with tracks already.	So what is up with The Spy Who Loved Me?	Basically, it is the same old thing. Only better sounding.	You might think the soundtrack would contain the actual music from the movie: The title song and the end titles as it was heard in the film (right now you can only transfer it from DVD), the music used for Bond and Anya on a boat to Cairo, Bond and Anya following Jaws into the Egyptian ruins, the underwater battle between the Espirit Lotus and Stromberg's frogmen, the battle on board the Liparus, Bond wetbiking to Atlantis, Atlantis' destruction, the chase between Bond, Anya, Jaws, and Naomi (and the cue used for the Lotus' entrance into the water).	Instead we get THIS.	Perhaps there is some kind of contractual agreement (or disagreement) here between Marvin Hamlisch and the powers that be; you can remaster The Spy Who Loved Me all you can....but nevertheless it is NOT the soundtrack that the movie, AND the fans deserved.
1,"Cha-ching!" Pink Floyd fans must have felt ripped off by "A Collection of Great Dance Songs" . . . and deservedly so. Except for the re-recording of "Money," this cynical 1981 package rehashes material better heard on the group's original albums. No context, no shame.
1,This CD is like most R&B today. Boring. With the exception of "Heaven" and "VIP" this sounds just like every other R&B song out there. Like R&B itself these days, Foxx's CD is very predictable. Obviosusly, Foxx is smart enough to realize that he has to market his CD towards women, so most of the songs are something that women would probably get into. Although, they have to be somewhat turned off by his "player" style. Foxx does sound good as a singer, but his song choices fail him in the end. As I said "Heaven" and "VIP" are the only songs worth listening to on here. As the other songs are dull and very predictable.
1,I'm altogether dispirited		I've listened to this about 5-6 times all the way through, and not one song has made an impression		Read the lyrics - they're ok - I don't really care too much about lyrics. My favorite album by REM (Murmur) and I don't know the lyrics on most of my favorite songs on that (Radio Free Europe, Perfect Circle)		I am absolutely miserable. I mean, I'm still gonna listen to the group. I'll stick pick up the next album. But none of these songs are very good. There aren't really any strong melodies		Pete, you can do better! You played on Robyn's very good album Ole Tarantula for gods sake.		I can't imagine someone picking up this album and loving it. The first few times I listened to this album I was depressed for a week		Blah! Not a bad album (I guess) but unmemorable. It sounds off; I like when REM rock out (Monster's good) but there seems to be a distinct lack of good solid songs here		I'm sticking to Love's Forever Changes from now on.
1,I love Disney. Love love love it. Probably more than a dude my age should,  for example yeterday my friends and I drove to the beach, about 3 hours away from my home, and I think we listened to my Disney CD's about solid 5 hours of the round trip.  However,  we went through the Tarzan on Broadway soundtrack, and I was frankly a little disappointed, I found the instrumentation behind the singing a bit lacking, and the songs wrote in for the show had weak diction. Also someone should teach Tarzan how to say different, I know it looks like it has three syllables buddy but we don't need you to articulate each one. Overall I was not impressed,  if you are looking for a solid Disney soundtrack, I recommend The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
1,i aint even gotta put up a whole paragraph tellin people why chammilionaire is betta, just listen to some of chams music first.
1,Hey what's up with this...it's all in spanish. What's the matter don omar no habla the ingles?
1,I am in agreement with the low ratings. After a long hiatus this is no longer the Jane Olivor that thrilled us with First Night and Stay the Night. There is not a good song on this album; it should never have been made. The production is off in fact amateurish, her voice is out of sync, and her heart and soul does not capture the spirit of the Christmas Holiday.
1,The pre-album release of the single "Under Cover of Darkness" had me eagerly anticipating the release of "Angles." However, once given the chance to listen to the whole album, it unfortunately falls short of the expectations set forth by the lead single. There's a few tuneful hooks here and there, but most just drone on - quite an accomplishment for an album that has only one song that's over 4 minutes! I'm not into lyrics that much, but if I was, I'd be disappointed there too - there are only a few words mumbled by Julian Casablancas that can be understood.		I'm still a The Strokes fan, but this does not represent their best work.
1,Just saw the movie last night. I love most of Mann's movies, especially because of the way he layers in awesome music. If you saw Heat, you remember how the music was great and set the mood of the scenes just right. This time around, there is something missing. The songs I liked the best were 2 new songs I heard from audioslave (another reviewer mentioned this), but they aren't even on the soundtrack! Same with the Jay-z opening track. To top it all off, the electronica mixes/covers of Nina Simone's Sinner Man and Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight were just weak. Try the originals of those songs and you'll see what I mean. Those would have rocked. I keep waiting for another soundtrack like Heat. Collateral didn't have it (only a few good songs there) and neither does this. Sigh.
1,N'Sync are no Xtynct. No one listens to these fairies who sing like they were castrated pallies. I can't believe the FIVE STAR REVIEWERS can't accept that teen pop is OVER! Avoid or I'll yell HEEGOTCHA!
1,A reason why Mike Love is not the Beach Boys...no matter what he thinks or says.
1,I give Sinead O'Connor Dap for trying something different,but the Problem is this is the kind of Album that would have made more sense 10 years back when there still was half way of some interest in Her as a Artist.hooking up with Sly&Robbie is a good move,but while this Album is clearly better than Willie Nelson's attempt at Reggae,it is lacking some depth in places. Her Vocals are still good,but some of that fire&spunk she use ot have is missing in Action on this Album to give the Record any kind of overall lift.still I applaud Her in trying something different&Being Credible with it.she has dealt with alot. I Respect Her as a Artist.
1,I love DT, but this disc contains versions of many of these songs that are lackluster and occasionally, just plain bad.  James destroys his voice on "Voices" (how ironic) and most of the other songs I've heard performed MUCH better than this on imports or on video.  Gave it two stars just because it's DT and there are some good spots, but I'd like to see them apply the "quality not quantity" rule a lot more.  Pass.
1,I actually had somewhat high hopes for this album. Daughtry showcased his impressive vocal capabilities along with an appreciation for the classics on American Idol, so I thought his album might be a fusion of those two qualities.  Wrong.  The music on this album is utterly indistinguishable from the legions of other "alternative" artists on the radio today.  Simple guitar riffs repeated over and over, yawn-inducing percussion, cookie-cutter song structure...when will this "alternative" wasteland finally be done away with?  I anxiously await the day.
1,I guess I was anticipating a big Phil Spector Wall-of-Sound production.  In fact, Ms. Love's voice is not that big, and the sound is much quieter than expected.  There are brief flashes of the old Darlene Love, but though it kills me to say this, there are a few bad notes, and mostly it's just boring.  I really wanted this to be great.  Maybe after a few listens it will grow on me, but for now, once we get into the real Christmas season, I'll be listening to A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector.
1,One word can summarize this album: Yawn! It's boring, predictable and generic. They all had to rely on dressing like transvestites for this album to sell and failed epically. Check out Green Day for real punk.
1,I thought it would have more catchy melodies. Was not impressed. Found the nasal twang annoying too. Prefer Lady Antebellum.
1,First off, I don't like Linkin Park, but I've listened to the band's previous two albums enough years ago to get an idea of how the band used to be. "Hybrid Theory" was a CD that was my favorite years ago, but I've grown tired of it quickly. "Meteora" is cut-and-paste material. After a four year wait, LP fans experience the dramatic change that they have latched themselves to. They thought that "nu-metal isn't cool anymore, let's go for the cookie cutter indie sound that the kids adore nowadays", and that is a representation of Minutes to Midnight. I remembering listening to "What I've Done", and I think to myself, "Is THAT Linkin Park?" Sad but true, Linkin Park have sunken down into a deeper hole. They keep making music, yet they fail to realize that they have not been cared for since 2003. And now they release a forgettable load of trash.		Avoid this at all cost and buy real music.
1,Not Good ! very disappointing. The blokes have had a hard time following up since Painkiller !!! Not only is this boring, it is double boring ! Two CDS !!!!!!!!	They are still good as a live act though !	Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge rule !
1,In all fairness, I should give Presence one star. Out of it's seven songs, only one doesn't fall flat on it's face. The rest of the album is unlistenable, and virtually nothing here works. It's worse than its followup, In Through the Out Door...and that's really saying something.	So, what justifies two stars? Achilles Last Stand, the aforementioned good song, is arguably the best song in the Zeppelin catalogue. Don't get fooled by it's length, that's ten-and-a-half minutes of pure POWER. Sadly, the rest of the album ranges in quality from poor (Hots On for Nowhere) to nearly unlistenable (Tea For One). Every song simply sounds the same, with the exception of Achilles Last Stand. No quirky experiments with Eastern, folk or funk, part of what made Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti such good albums It kicks off in the right direction, but quickly spirals into disaster. Oh yeah, and the lyrics sound like someone opened up a can of Zeppelin cliches and  dumped them everywhere. Some Zeppelin albums work (the debut, II, Houses, Graffiti). This is not one.	To end this review, you don't even need to buy this album for Achilles Last Stand. You get it on the Lattter Days compilation. So why waste 15 bucks on this one?
1,I moderately enjoyed Chesney's 2004 release When the Sun Goes Down. I found his post-adolescent desires to return to an adolescent past charming. I liked the father-daughter song. I liked the song where Chesney's so drunk he can't keep his metaphors straight. I even liked the Jimmy Buffett imitation on the title track.		But now Chesney, who owns a home in the U.S. Virgin Islands, believes he IS Jimmy Buffett, or Buffett's heir to the pirate throne. Be As You Are marks the first CD where Chesney writes or co-writes all the songs, but rather than giving listeners years' worth of stored country goodies, Chesney instead delivers an island escape concept record, and all the stale images come rolling out: pia coladas, mangos, hammocks, straw hats, white sails, red sunsets, pirates, escaping the rat race back stateside, and so on. The most adventurous Chesney gets are two dope smoking references and an awkward sexual pun involving eating his woman's key lime pie.		My favorite dumb lyrics:		  He walked in with a salty sway	  Lookin' like Blackbeard in his day  ("Soul of a Sailor")		  Maybe I could've been a pirate	  Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be  ("French Kissing  Life")		And the songs? They're all painfully sluggish, as if Chesney could only muster the energy to grab his guitar after a long nude nap on the sand.		For more reviews, visit [...]
1,...because if you don't, you'll hate this.	Following a couple of fine albums ('Okie Dokie' and 'Baghdad Batteries') were a couple of fairly tedious offerings ('Metallic Spheres' & 'C Batter C') and now, well, it's back to the past and...reggae. Ho hum.	It seems to me that when an artist reverts to reggae, they're struggling to come up with ideas.
1,This is great music but you can get this album domestically as part of "Mwandishi: The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings" for literally pocket change more.  It's worth it to check out the other two albums included in the set.
1,Def Leppard should have released the rariteis album Retro Active and used these filler songs for the b sides. This album is weak. The only reason i give it two stars is for the only two songs on the disk that are not filler. Those songs would be 'White Lightning' and 'Tear It Down'. This album did well but it was just a poor attempt to recreate 'Hysteria'. Pick up Retro Active instead.
1,I don't see how any one  besides straight edge p*ssies can find this crap "brutal" because trust me... Its far from that! Hatebreed's "perseverance" is pure crap. Anyways,i quess im too old but i rather enjoy my death collection or possessed or morbid angel collectuion more then this garbage. I'll say tho you want brutal ? Listing to disgorge, dyingfetus,devourment, severe torture, internal suffering ,cryptopsy, necrophagist because hatebreed isn't brutal or nearly brutal but insted they sound like posers that have a winp sound.
1,what's the point? don't we all own all the nirvana albums already? haven't we owned them for over 10 years? why do we need to give courtney love our money for a greatest hits record? -all of the hits we can recite in our sleep. why do we need this convoluted marketing gimmick in out lives? we get one new song after all these years. i'm sure cobain is thrilled... if you spend money on this you are a dope.
1,My opinion only:  This is my first(and last) purchase of a Residents album.  I've heard about them forever but never gave them a try.  I did listen to this all the way thru but can't bring myself to give it a second listen.  I don't get this at aaallllll.  If u want to listen to something very cool, unique, and important while still being somewhat experimental then I suggest Pere Ubu's debut album The Modern Dance and turn it up.  Just my thoughts....my opinion only.
1,Anybody who thinks this is rock , must have rocks for brains . This is soft touch pop rock and not in rocks league, damn i have rockier toothpaste .
1,Oh, just awful. If there are two things that I can't stand, its wacko liberals and punk rock, and this cd is a sickening combination of the two. Sum 41, the Ataris, and everyone else on this cd can all "shove it". Punk rock is so commercialized now it lost the true meaning of punk a long time ago. Check out something worthwhile like seether or godsmack, or anything else that uses more than just a power chord.
1,Sorry ladies and gents, what we have here is either EMI's attempt to cash in on the dead (hence the title) or the band's attempt to fulfill a contract.  If it is your opinion that this band can do no wrong, then by all means, buy this.  If you believe that the departure of Adrian Smith was a huge blow to this band, then don't bother unless you can get this on the cheap.  As much fun as it is to watch Janick Gers onstage with the reunited line-up with Bruce and Adrian in it, the fact of the matter is that he just was not a good replacement for Adrian.  Yes, he is a great guitarist, but he had quite a difficult time making Adrian's melodies his own.  Consider the music that the band made without Adrian...Gers almost mimicked what Dave Murray was doing, his solos were half-baked and were without melody.  The 2 Minutes to Midnight intro is absolutely painful to listen to.  The rest of the album is not much better.  Dickinson is not up to snuff here either.  Disc 1 of this duo is what makes the album a 2-star review instead of one.  Originally, this was 2 separate releases. Sanctuary's re-release as one set was a good idea.
1,Gah... I just don't see the point.. Even by pop punk standards this is pretty sub-par. If you like this kind of stuff, check out the Icarus Line instead.
1,LFO is one of the worst teen products I have seen in recent history 70s through 90s.	With their first single "Summer Girls" a badly produced rap song that when you hear it on the radio you think it is an ad  for "Abercrombie & Fitch", they mention the store I think 18  times in this idiotic song.	The album fares even worse with dittys like  "Girls on TV" and "I Don't Wanna Kiss You  Tonight"---why? have a cold sore.  Both singles bombed on the charts,  I think "Summer Girls" made it to the Top Ten because Abercrombie  & Fitch were their buying public buying up the whole lot - the song got  into the top 10 on Billboard only on sales points alone, not on  airplay.	The whole album is a mess.  These labels think they can get 98  Degrees or N Sync clones by waxing their eyebrows and pushing some  weights....I am sorry it takes talent, and of course a vocal range which  this band does not have.	They are in no league with 98 Degrees, BB Mak or  N Sync.  They play no instruments, can't sing, and their songs are the  worst bubble gum pop I have heard in my life.	The public speaks...this  album has not done well on the charts, they haven't gotten any radio  airplay, except for the occasional "Summer Girls", and sales to  say the least have been sluggish.	Thank god!....It shows Teen Girls do  have taste.
1,This and "Down In It" are the most useless Halos in the NIN collection. Everything here is available elsewhere. The version of "Only" is exactly the same as the album mix on "With Teeth". The DFA mix of "The Hand That Feeds" is available on the "Every Day is Exactly The Same" single, which actually includes TWO ADDITIONAL MIXES of "Only" not even on this disc. The video is available on the "Beside You In Time" Blu-Ray and DVD. The only AUDIO not available here is the rehearsal of "Love Is Not Enough". But guess what? The VIDEO of that rehearsal is also on the "Beside You In Time" disc. So if you bought all three of those releases (all great halos) and burned yourself a copy of this CD, you'd spend $50 max, which is the CHEAPEST sellers on Amizon are asking for. If you see a $10 copy of this in a cd shop somewhere pick it up,  but otherwise save your money.
1,neko case-marais la nuit		30 plus minutes of a "4 minute loop of frogs"=the most irritating 30 minutes and waste of time in recording history. I actually listened to the CD and IMHO...it's crap and the last track is 30+ minutes of my life that I'll never be able to get back. Maybe I should tape Pumba my Pug, snoring and loop it for 70 minutes and sell it as my latest album. Good ideas.....I got a million of em!
1,This is the last straw.  This makes my hair want to fall out.  You guys can't be serious.  Does anybody know hip-hop anymore?  Lloyd Banks can't rap a lick.  His ryhmes are very elementary.  His flow is one dimensional.  His punch lines are so lame and most of them don't even make sense.  If you bought this album or even bootlegged it you need to be hung by your pinky toe.  I'm going to leave with this quote from "On Fire"-  I'm buying diamonds by the pair/bu when you stop the only thing still spinning is your ear.  ENOUGH SAID!!
1,I've loved Mogwai, but I don't love this album. It's an unremarkable, boring disappointment. I don't know what else to say. I think they might be officially done. There's not a single stand-out track on this record.		MY FATHER, MY KING is now 10 years old... it might as well have been recorded by a completely different band. It sure feels and sounds it.
1,Erotica should be an album thriving with songs in the order of 'Vogue', 'Deeper & deeper', and 'Express yourself'. In short,  The Vogue and/or 'House' Album. Instead, we're pitched the unexciting, uninspiring, and unimaginative Erotica. Not only is this Album of demo-like quality but, most of it's craft (or lack there of) has little substance to it. For instance, the 'did I do it?' track, a complete Rap song by an Unknown, or Miscellaneous Male Rapper. Madonna utters not one single word, this song also shares the exact same music as 'The Waiting', another bland, and pointless waste of space. The subpar mastering and stripped down production comes off more underdeveloped & low budget than an actual audio effect. As a result, much of these songs are disposable and/or unlistenable. Although this album is her most controversial record content wise, it's also the least remembered of the bunch. Most people don't even recall her having an album at this point in time. There's no memorable hits that anyone can reference other than diehard fans. The album got most of it's promo through tours and not radio. It feels as if Madonna needed more time to get inspired before this production took place.
1,I had a lot of expectatations when I bought this album, having listened to her songs for about 5 years now. It just never grew on me no matter how long I listened to it. A few songs are okay but the rest of them are really  disappointing. It does not have the spirit of her other albums.
1,Wife and I listen to a lot of Barbra, but this one is a travesty. I had to hear each selection done by a classical singer after hearing this just to get my head straight.
1,Styx' Big Bang Theory -- 13 classic rock covers plus a remake of their own "Blue Collar Man" -- is a strong candidate for the worst mainstream rock release of the year.  The project takes some obvious cues from Rush's 8-song covers EP of last summer:  that release, clearly intended as a fun side project for the band and its fans, included some interesting, if not earthshaking, interpretations of classic rock songs, without sacrificing the unique sound of that band.  Alas, Styx has not done nearly as well on this full-length disc: workmanlike, sometimes grim renditions of a hodgepodge of songs and styles.  Not one song here adds anything to or provides a different	persepective on the original, and several -- including versions of Jethro Tull's "Locomotive Breath" and CSN's "Find the Cost of Freedom" -- are actively terrible.		The only real energy here comes in the opening track, a faithful (down to the Shakespear quotes in the ending vamp) rendition of "I Am the Walrus" that starts out OK though unnecessary and becomes unintentionally hilarious as the arena-rock ending kicks in, and a rock arrangement of Willie Dixon's "It Don't Make Sense (You Can't Make Peace)" which is hampered by the limited vocal skills of James Young.  Most everything else is just rote imitiations -- imagine a weekend-in-the-studio demo set by any competent covers band, and you'll have all you need to know about this (of course few covers bands have a major-label contract to fulfill).		My best guess is that these guys, after a few failed attempts at putting out "real" albums, have resigned themselves to the fact that they are now and forever will be a nostalgia act, and figure they might as well broaden their playlist.  But whoever first uttered the words "Styx covers Hendrix" (or The Who or The Beatles) needs to be pilloried.
1,I just received my copy and find it sounds like only the woofers are connected---where is the mid and upper frequency ?  Very poor mix which is unusual 'cause Glenn Hughes' solo albums all sound so well produced . Does anyone else not hear what we should?--reminds me of Black Sabbath 'Born Again' which suffered the same injustice
1,If you LIKE every last song to be about the same things over and over ... with no originality, with no imagination and always with the most trite and predictable rhymes, then Billy Dean is for you. If you want to hear about nothing but how hard working country people are and how patriotic and worshipful and better than anybody else they are, then this is for you. If you like the same dinner every night with no change, then Billy Dean is for you.		Seriously, yes, he always goes for the first and most obvious line that comes into his head and never once has it crossed his mind that it has already been done ten million times by every other country artist who ever lived. If you like music with nothing new, nothing to challenge your preconceptions, nothing to suggest that any other lifestyle has the least merit, then Billy Dean is for you.		But for me, he is as pathetic as they get.
1,At this point in what I suppose you could call their 'career', you have to wonder whether the members of VNV Nation are actually engaging in an elaborate Andy Kaufmanesque prank designed to see how many times they can release the same album before people cotton on and lose interest completely.		While the notion that a band can spend an entire career mining variations on a particular sound or theme is perfectly legitimate, when a band continues to rehash exactly the same bland sound and trite, horribly self-involved lyrics (almost verbatim) for period of nine years or so, one begins to wonder whether the title of this album itself isn't in fact a knowing joke by the band concerning both the lack of effort put into its conception and production - although the band would have us believe that they endured something of a rosy crucifixion during the production of this album; it would seem that what didn't kill them made them blander - and the increasing mindlessness, gullibility and lacking critical faculty of certain elements of their audience (although I suppose calling it "Formulaic", "Generic" or "Automatic For The Sheeple" would've been gilding the Lily somewhat - then again, they could well be the titles of the next couple of albums for all I know). Given the lumpen nature of the tracks offered up here, one has to seriously question how much further patience the more critically discerning elements of its audience has.		To break the album down into its component parts:		"On-Air" is the obligatory mood-setting instrumental which, despite mixing analogue radio static, choral synths, and the 'Atomic clock pips' motif from 'Future Perfect', still descends into tedium long before the deeply pedestrian mournful Piano refrain has kicked in (which is no mean feat for a track that lasts just over three minutes).		"Space And Time" is your prototypical jaunty post "Matter And Form" era album opener and recycles so many of the lyrical motifs that have been overused on the last few albums ("let the current carry me", "on open seas", "lost in thought") that the band should surely be line for some sort of Queen's award for recycling by now. It's really only notable for the spectacularly fluffed opening line - "Teeeeear Aaaapaaart" (which, rather amusingly, sounds as if the vocalist has been surprised on the toilet by a sound engineer wielding a microphone and demanding that he sing while at stool) - and the fact that the band inadvertently name-checks Channel 4's 'Grand Designs' ("Bunty and Tarquin have really made the most of Frank Lloyd Wright's theories concerning the use of space and light in their environmentally friendly new build in Cheshire...")		"Resolution" is techno by way of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' on a football terrace. You've heard the band mine this particular seam both musically and lyrically many, many times and, let's face it, it was tedious the first time. Trite sentiment is the order of the day: "Raise your head up high and blow your brains out," to paraphrase 'The Bloodhound Gang'.		"Control" is the obligatory cookie-cutter snarly "blood and anger" track that has popped up with pedestrian regularity on all of the last few releases (see "Entropy", "Testament" et al). Musically and lyrically it fails to convince as a statement of indignation, ambition or intent and the word-association-football lyrics are also inadvertently hysterical (because if photographs are to be believed, certain members of the band have already acquired all the body that one can comfortably enjoy).		"Goodbye 20th Century" is a slim finger-paring of nothing which is about the best thing you can say about it. A blandly grandiose synth limps lazily over the distorted narration from an upbeat fifties propaganda piece/news reel concerning the potential wonders of 'the world of tomorrow'. Get the irony, kids? It seems like every industrial and nu-metal band in the last twenty years has recorded this track; even those masters of the mediocre, 'Linkin Park', have mined this particular seam of banality recently.		"Streamline" is essentially Giorgo Moroder's synth-line from 'I Feel Love' combined with some rather obvious and painfully-rhymed couplets concerning how nice it would be to be live in an art-deco future. A fair enough sentiment, but seeing as this band devoted an entire album to this very topic about ten years ago, one does feel that they're repeating themselves somewhat.		"Gratitude" pulls of the difficult trick of being morose, petulant, self-involved and egocentric at the same time. Musically it's indifferent and lyrically it's little more than a slightly more verbose take on the song 'Thank You' by RnB songstress 'Jamelia'. Listening to it is sort of like being cornered in the pub by a drunkenly emphatic and rather surly divorcee who insists that he's over his marriage (and is so much stronger for it) but who then proceeds to spend the next two hours talking about his ex-wife.		"Nova" sends us back to football terraces. Yes, it may be anthemic and probably the best track from a bad bunch, but it's still utterly generic.		"Photon" is a bargain basement William Orbit knock-off (circa his 'Adagio' album) and sounds like something that would be played over the goal highlights at the end of an edition of British Sports program, 'Grandstand'. I'll be honest I skipped through this one because I was losing the will to live by the mid-way point some three minutes in.		"Radio" is the staple protracted album-closer and in isolation is really indicative of much of what is wrong with the album as a whole: like many of the songs, it is far too long; like many of the songs, its lyrics are trite in their espousal of cookie-cutter pop-psychology platitudes and, like virtually all of the songs, it is just not musically interesting enough to hold one's attention for its duration.		To summarize, I suspect that at this point in their career the audience for VNV Nation is, in a certain regard, now analogous to that of the audience for Michael Bay movies: on the one hand, there are those who are young and nave enough to think that a tired collection of gee-whiz sounds or pretty CGI - devoid of any real interest, content or motivation beyond securing a profit margin and maintaining a foot-hold in the market-place - really is the greatest thing since Sliced Bread; and on the other, there are those who gain a perverse sense of enjoyment from going along to see what kind of bland, derivative cr*p is going to be wheeled out this time and how much further the material can descend. I, for my own part, have only ever seen three Michael Bay movies: I paid to see one, the rest I slept through when they were shown on Television; this attitude also neatly encapsulates my feelings towards VNV Nation. Thanks to a combination of friend's copies, Youtube and Last. FM, I haven't had to part with money in order to perform (or rather endure) my cursory one listen-though to each of the albums that they've released since 'Future Perfect', but then there is a certain poetic justice in that, because as more people than I care to mention have observed recently, they haven't actually released a new album since 'Future Perfect'.		Final Report Card For "Automatic":		Ten out of Ten for commitment to the concept of recycling.		One out of Ten for short-changing the audience yet again.
1,This is just some over the hill bass player that use to be in amazing band desperately clinging onto something that died a long long long time ago! If this wasn't called a Misfits album then the album wouldn't be so bad, but come on this isn't even close to what the band was!
1,Nothing interesting here - no melodies, good groove beats, etc.  Just a bunch of obscene language.  There's a lot better rap than this one - save your money.
1,I bought this cd based on other reviews and seeing it in people's listmanias.  What a disappointment. It seems WW can't make up their mind what type of sound they want. It's all over the place. Most songs sound like Kate Bush and even The Sundays (Joyride). For good measure a goth metalish song (Ghost) is thrown in. The only song that has a progressive feel to it is Splinters. This disc lacks any kind of consistency whatsoever. On one positive note, I did like the female vocals. Just pick a style and work with it!
1,I remember the soundtrack for The Exorcist: eerie, yet melodic. Perfect for the demoniacal nature of the beast, so to speak. Of course all was driven by the incessant chiming of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells backed by the low, dark, throbbing menace of the underbelly of the film. I do not think I'm being overzealous when I  say that it is this music that sets the theme for the entire movie while in and of itself becoming one of the best and most recognizable cinematic themes.		So why the 1 star?, you (rightfully!) ask. Unfortunately Tubular Bells covers only about 6 minutes of the roughly 50 minute score. The rest is an ear-piercing cacophony of non melodious screeching that quickly wears thin. This is definitely one time my musical memory failed me. What I remembered was the mastery of Tubular Bells and mercifully (except for my wallet in purchasing this item!) none of the rest.		Technically this recording is a pitiful failure on its own, not even discussing the merits of the materials. The disc is unlistenable because of the total lack of attention to the  recording volumes. It was nearly a full minute until the melodies of Tubular Bells could even be heard without constantly readjusting the volume level. Of course, this softening and drawing out was repeated at the end of the song and by the time the next piece deigned to begin, one might have thought that there was some horrible glitch in the recording. I usually play my car music system in the range of 10-16 depending on the type of music. For the song Windharp on this soundtrack, I had the volume level set at 30 (!!!) and still could just barely hear the music.		I suggest saving your money on this debacle. I know I personally will probably never play it again. Better yet, search out Oldfield's original album entitled Tubular Bells. There they will probably chime brightly on their own while causing you, the listener, to envision one of the cinema worldl's prime horror movies: The Exorcist.
1,Kelly Clarkson had a great pop album with "Breakaway" and I made this purchase only because certain publications (The New York Times, for instance) insisted that "All I Ever Wanted" was a `sonic masterpiece'. What a joke. Even though Clarkson possesses a stellar voice, her vocals are thoroughly drowned out in a sea of fake-rock production on this album, which at best is a two-star record dressed up as a classic.		The primary problem is that there are really no good songs here. I am also not a fan of female vocalists who `scream' out all the lyrics, rendering them incomprehensible. Christina Aguilera has this same problem, which was why her "Back to Basics" record was so dismal. Kelly on the other hand, can show restraint when given the right song (aka the beautiful "Because of you" from a few years ago). Here, however, every note seems overwrought, every other song seems yelled out, and there is absolutely no sense of fun, let alone depth.		The lead single, which tune-wise is the best thing here, stands out in stark comparison to the Kara DioGuardi-penned second track, which is also the second single. I kid you not, this sounds like some leftover album track from a Miley Cyrus record, or worse still, a Hilary Duff record circa 2003. And not in a good way. I understand the need for pop-rock elements in albums these days, and Avril Lavigne and Ashlee Simpson have all had some success with it, but they were really crossing that line here, with screechy guitars and hilarious riffs all supposed to be `songs'. Personally I found this album a total waste of time, and to think I paid full retail for it.		Heres the thing - Kelly Clarkson's best album was "My December" and of course not many people bothered to buy that one. This is a far inferior, subpar album and I am a loss for words as to how its getting all these glowing reviews. Tracks 4-7 sound almost identical. No change in key, no difference in chorus even. Every semi-quietish verse blows up into a samey-sounding chorus. This worked well on "Since you've been gone", but at least that song had a good tune. Everything here is bland and lifeless - quite a letdown.		Two Stars. Definitely overhyped, and a wasted purchase. Save your money for "The Hazards of Love" by The Decemberists, or "Middle Cyclone" by Neko Case. Now that's music.
1,This is a prime example of why the historical performance movement is so vital and important.  I'm sure everyone involved with this recording is an accomplished and thoughtful musician, but why anybody would butcher J.S. Bach in this way is beyond me.  It is simply wrong to treat "Wachet Auf" as if it were a Verdi opera.  You may as well score Vivaldi's famous "Four Seasons" concertos from his Op. 8 for 1,001 piccolos (if that hasn't been done already).  The orchestra is too big and clunky, the choir is trying their best to drown out the orchestra, and the direction is heavy handed.  I don't see how people can complain about period instruments when they compare this recording of BWV 140 to Gardiner, Rifkin, or even Harnoncourt - who all treat this music with the graceful touch it requires.  I would liken Richter's approach to swatting a fly with a television set.  I also recommend Koopman or Gardiner's recordings of the Magnificat, though there are many fine versions of that work available.  I admit I am prejudiced toward period instruments, but I gave this CD a fair chance and it disappointed.  The question of "what Bach wanted" is moot, this is not a good performance.
1,O.K. it's alright to call me finicky when it comes to music, because I am. So my first thought upon hearing the first three songs on this CD were the dreaded over-produced feeling that I first experienced. Thankfully things started to go somewhat uphill from the fourth song onward giving  us the chance to hear the splendid range and tone of his wonderful voice. From Soul, Zydeco, Jazz, Golden Oldies it's a mixed bag. The best track being a spine chilling duet with Linda Ronstadt. In addition his rendition of the beautiful song; "These Foolish Things" is the best I've ever heard.
1,I spun this for the first time in 2008 and thought "man these raps are dated as hell".  I didn't want to rush to judgement so I waited to spin it again in 2010.  Basically, I'm done with this cd.  There is really no need to spin it ever again. I sold it back to second spin for 50 cents.  That is the most they would give me as the bargain bins are littered with copies of this cd.		Where are the concerned parents of the late 80s that rushed in to claim this was vile music not suitable for children?  Gone.  They have moved on to other forms of culture they believe corrupt children (tv violence etc.).		Forty-four music critics in 1989 gave nods to this cd in the 1989 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.  Where are these critics now?  Are they tossing this gem of an album on their cd player when they get home from work in 2011?  No.		If you want super dated raps and beats check this out.  I think on the entire cd I heard maybe 1 - 2 tracks that were decent.		Some wag will say "ohh you are benefiting from the magic of hindsight to conclude this record sucks".  I agree. Hindsight is a useful tool for sussing out bad music.  Be leery of buying this cd.
1,...is what a Washington Post reviewer called her and it's true.		There's a lot to like about Alicia Keys: She's a terrific person giving both money and time to several causes; she's classy - you'll never confuse her with Lil Kim.		But, let's be honest, her music is just MOR pap. We'd like to be astonished whenever we pick up a Keys cd, but really, all we ever get is 9 or 10 of the same slickly-produced piano ballads that you get on every single cd from her.		In a way, she's a female 50 Cent. Just like 50 poses as a gangsta but is really only interested in selling watered-down hip hop to suburban 15-year olds, so too does Keys' record company and management push her as an "innovative" and "dynamic" artist just because she plays the piano. But their primary role for her is that, with her model good looks, she's someone who can produce "soul music" that's suitable and non-threatening to the soccer-mom demographic.		Keys loves to name drop Prince, Stevie Wonder and Nina Simone as influences but let's be real: she's a lot closer to Toni Braxton or Leona Lewis.
1,I think there are lots of weak songs on this album, that's why I give his album 2 stars. I like Judas Priest very much, but this album is the album that I never listen because this kinda sucks. Believe me, I have tried to get into this album, but it jsut didn't work. I hope that this review is helpful to you.
1,...then maybe try this one. It's good steady soul produced by Quincy Jones but basically pretty boring and unspectacular. Nothing new has been tried and covering "You put a spell..." by Mica Paris doesn't really give any surprise either
1,I repeat, please go away! Thank you!  This has been a	test of the emergency annoyance and lack of talent	alarm alert system.  Were this an actual alarm, we	would ask you to all turn off Fergalious and go to your	nearest cd or downloading music store and purchase	better executive pop music.  We now return you to the	Dutchess herself.
1,Bocelli has a better than average voice for a pop singer, but with the best will in the world, it is not good enough for opera. It is a scary thought to see that this recording of La Boheme may very well become the best selling recording of an opera ever, especially when there are so many great recordings of Puccini's best opera. It would be useless to compare Bocelli with a Pavarotti or a Di Stefano since they simply belong to a different league of singers, but please, if this is your first try at opera, you could do a lot worse than buying Herbert von Karajan's 1972 recording with Mirella Freni and Pavarotti in London. Pavarotti had back then a truly God-given voice, and sings his heart out as Rodolfo. Mirella Freni is pure magic as Mimi, and Herbert von Karajan draws the most gorgeous sounds from the Berlin Philharmonic. Twenty years ago an opera recording with a pop singer would have been unthinkable, I wonder what the A & R people from Universal have in store for us: maybe a Turandot with Boy George, or a Tosca with Brittney Spears?
1,Since AMAZON and the, the IBDB, and IMDB are the now SAME COMPANY, and the IMDB through absolute proof of identity, has admitted that JOHN CHARLES THOMAS was just one of the names of the performer JOSEPH TONER, all of the fake photos of him, and lies about when he was born and died, are out the window. Joseph Toner lived a long, long time, yet another man impersonated him well enough to convince the world. GROUCHO MARX who absolutely knew better, put that false identity on his show, YOU BET YOUR LIFE.		In this record the years of the recordings are totally falsified. Re: Sing a song of Sixpence, one of my personal favorites,  belonged to the 2000 series of Victor Records. What does that mean? Simply put it was recorded about 2011. And Joseph Toner simply made it up. It was CLAIMED to have been scored by ALBERT HAY MALOTTE, the supposidly same man who wrote the OUR FATHER?		By 1936 some were given a 10-____ number, such as was Mr. Pinza's OWN COMPOSITION, which was propmtly stolen by Victor Records, most unusual as he was supposidly tied to Columbia. NO. Ezio Pinza was a GREAT ARTIST of our METROPOLITAN OPERA, and sang during a period with the greatest Baritone in it's history. JOSEPH TONER. They sang together once it was possible to record them in what is called "Fidelity"-not "HIGH FIDELITY" but good enough to be able to  capture the greatness of their performances. It was a huge breakthrough in the development of recordings systems. They sang with Lily Ponz, a superior soprano, much of her work survived as she signed up with Philco/the other industrialists/in the post WWII neo-nazi regeime, but JOHN CHARLES THOMAS AKA Joseph Toner, and EZIO PINZA refused.		A 3 1/2 hour recored broadcast, talked about well into the 70's and owned for a period as it was published as per the writings of the Trapp Family Singers (who expected it to be supressed as the conductor, Bruno Walter, was a Jew). This was a crime as it is documented, even in the falsified history of JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, and in the NY TIMES, that the singer had to raise-and we are talking during the depression on the gold standard, $300,000.00 to GIVE TO THE MET as a "GUARANTEE" against the cost of future recordings! Thus one not only did Mr. Toner have to be invited, but then he had to pay his way to support the institution, and any recordings that the institution made of that singer. $300,000.00 in 1933 was a LOT of MONEY. He had to pay his own expenses for travel and lessons to phonetically learn to sing in different languages, as he was dyslexic, and also never had an education, as he had sung in the theatre, under different names since the age of 6 or so, much like Jolson and Judy Garland, and he, like them, were taken advantage of by the system which all three worked to change, and all three were harmed for doing so. Anyone who opposed the Nazi sympathiezers in the Theatre, supporting Ford II, Edison,Jr, other industrialists, and eventually the electric companies, Gulf Oil, etc, all of whom took over huge numbers of copyrights, plagerized, merged with Columbia/Decca/EMI/etc, were simply wiped out of memory.		Movies gone, but still on the old books are 1944 "Song of the Open Road", 1935 "The Night is Young", c1944 "Great Day"  1950 "Hans Christian Anderson" all the way back to the original 1929 Show Boat that had the ORIGINAL Score of Show Boat, NOT written by Hammerstein II! And Many more.		Pinza's crime was for supporting Paul Robeson when Robeson was FORCED unwittingly to record Show Boat by the Shuberts under a false name, in 1939 and complained about it. So did Joseph Toner. It was SHELVED for 50 years. Sent to Australia. Pinza made himself vocal by singing two of the most famed works by his COLLEAGUE, PAUL ROBESON, one of which was DEEP RIVER. From there his massive amount of work for the Met was taken apart, and sent to AU in tiny excerpts, a terrible blow to our culture. These bits and pieces were returned after Pinza's death.		Everyone should be watching the "UNTOLD HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES" by Oliver Stone, he just did not go into how it appied to the theatre, but it did.		Please do not bother with this plagerized and not very worthwhile product.
1,I just purchased this on cassette from a library bin for 25 cents, and popped it into my car player on the way home. I could barely make it through the entire recording of New Age noodling, dreadful singing and jam-band pretentiousness. One cut sounded like a hoedown gone horribly wrong. Maybe if I were stoned ...	There exists wonderful World Music, psychedelia, and jazz, but this is none of them. I should have spent my quarter on some penny candy.	If this is George Martin's "favorite production", what does that say for the Beatles?	My first ever one star review.		bIGhIG
1,Luckily, I never bought Best of Vol I. So this is a better value for me than others. I am satisfied with the song selection from the Roth era, which is the only thing I was interested in. Like others have noted, Roth and Hagar each serve a different audience that have little in common. Roth VH caters to the traditional long-haired hard rock demographic of the early-80s and Hagar VH is for the trimmed and primped top 40 radio audience.		 Bearing the above in mind, that brings me to my main beef with this compilation - why on earth did they interlace each track with a different vocalist, i.e. Roth, Hagar, Roth, Hagar, Roth, Hagar, etc. That is beyond annoying! You have to buy both disks with the package. Why does the record company care if you only end up listening to one of them? They still get their money. It's like they're telling me "you better listen to Sammy, too, or he might feel bad."		 Now I have to burn all the Roth tracks on to a CD-R in order to avoid pressing the skip button on my stereo remote every four minutes (not to mention switching from disk 1 to disk 2). The three new tracks are not very impressive. The guitar playing is heavier but sounds tuned way down. The lyrics are completely moronic. Way immature for guys in their fifties. I would rather have 'Beat It' on here than 'Up for Breakfast.'		 Not worth $20 in my estimation. (I got it for $14.99 by the way.)
1,While NPR stations see this as the cream of the crop and give it lots of play & praise it meanders around with little enthusiasm. I found it dull and uninspiring.		Nora Jones classifies her output as "subtle", however that can also taken to mean boring. And that definition can also be used for this release.
1,They have a few good ones on this CD, but they all more or less sound the same. You will probably get bored of it after a while and not listen to it again. I would say don't buy it, but maybe get a single of guerrilla radio  or something. That was the best song on it.
1,Imagine a slightly younger sounding Paula Abdul fronting Ace of Base sped up to a more techno tempo, then add a gruff-voiced Fred Schneider-ish male singer and you're pretty well on the way to getting the sound of Aqua.		There are occasional surprises (the flamenco tinged guitar in mid-tempo "Good Morning Sunshine") but it's mostly standard synthy dance pop.		Pitfalls here come in the melody lines...many are almost indistinguishable (compare "Dr. Jones" and "Lollipop (Candy Man)" or "Happy Boys and Girls" hook with that of the big hit "Barbie Girl") and admittedly dance pop isn't usually the most cerebral of genres, but "Roses are Red" dances over the fine line. ("Roses are red and violets are blue, Honey is sweet but not as sweet as you, dum-de-da-dee-dum dum-de-da-dee-da").		Bottom Line: If you like "Barbie Girl" an awful awful lot...then you might enjoy this. Otherwise, you can probably find something else as danceable but with more flair. (Say, Information Society?)
1,Bodom has gone to hell with this one.  I have bought all their other releases and can say that they all have been great.  Hate Crew Death Roll was a bit of a bummer album because you could see that the bands technical abilities were going down the drain.  But all other albums were mind blowing!  This album shows that Alexi has sold out and has turned his band into a steaming pile of poo!  Not that I'm suprised, i mean one of his favorite albums is Slipknot crap!  COMMON!  Alexi get your head straight and pump out another Hatebreeder!
1,I bought this album that day it came out, listened to it twice and put it on my cd rack severely disappointed.  Every two years since, I grab the CD thinking, "Hey, it's the Crowes, it can't be -that- bad".  And every time, I put it back on the shelf.		It come down to this, if you like the Black Crowes and don't have this album, don't buy it.  I read all the press when this came out.  The album was supposed to be a return to their early days (ala Shake Your Moneymaker).  In my opinion, Moneymaker is good, but not nearly as good as Southern Harmony and Amorica.  Although By Your Side has the Shake vibe, it is at best secondhand rehash of that album.		In reading the positive reviews about this album, I have to think the authors aren't normally Crowes fans.  This album sounded like a hollow attempt to reclaim radio glory.  If you like radio rock, it might be for you.  If you think the Crowes are best when they are experimenting and grooving (ala Amorica) stay away from this one.
1,Alas, the original Amazon review is correct. This album is well produced but also very kitch. Beethoven in ambient soup is almost as bad as "Smoke on the water" sung by Pat Boone. I think that Orbit could  have made a much better album by reinterpreting (open) jazz standards. I  believe that there is no need to rearrange pieces of classical music that  are perfect and complete in themselves. So I can only explain this CD as a  cash-in operation after the successful Madonna album.	My humble advice  is, to those who like easy-listening classical music: buy the originals  (classical CDs are often sold at a bargain price), since they provide a  much pleasant, authentic listening experience. To those who are curious  about ambient, buy any CD of the Orb, or Boards of Canada, or Plaid, or  even the classic Eno.
1,A few songs I really liked and some I didn't like very much.
1,I want to like this album. I've been an avid fan since Speak + Spell and quite enjoy even many of the low points of their career to date. I'm hoping this album will grow on me, but after 5 listens I wonder if I'll even be listening a 6th time. There are a few promising/interesting moments, but they fail to sustain any interest. I haven't listened to the 5.1 mixes yet, but the stereo CD sounds really weak to boot: no depth of field, very narrow dynamic dynamic range. I'm unable to get excited about it. Hopefully it'll grow on me, but Depeche Mode used to grab me by the gut and amaze me on the 1st listen... *sigh*
1,I have been a fan of Kaufmann for several years.  I was leery about this album, but after reading the review in Opera News, I bought it.  Very disappointed!!  While his Wagner is excellent and his Werther is mostly very good, he is NOT a Verdi singer.  Most of the album, he is at full volume.  The few times he is not are rather nice, but he goes back to full volume elsewher in the aria.  Frankly, this album is difficult to listen to except a few numbers at a time.
1,Oh my!! Geddy Geddy, your bass playing will always be legendary but your legendary voice is SHOT!  What happened to it between your Snakes and Arrows Tour and this tour? Did 4 years really make such a horrible difference? IT DID! This is not an "one off bad night" due to cold either as I've seen you guys live on the Time Machine Tour as well. Not good either. I unfortunately bought this CD. I can't listen to more than 2 songs at a time without tossing it aside and putting in All The Worlds A Stage or Exit Stage Left. Instead of hearing those beautiful high notes of past we get a wailing, croaking Geddy butchering their classic stuff. Pack it in boys! Surpised this was ever released. Don't waste you money.
1,Only 3 good songs!!!!		Wind It up		Don't Get It Twisted		Yummy
1,You may have read reviews or comments about this somewhat controversial CD, that the performance of the Enigma Variations is eccentric, willful, wrong-headed or ill-conceived.  Having purchased it out of curiosity I'm inclined to agree.  It's a slowish reading that doesn't seem to cohere, centered by a marathon "Nimrod" that just...does...not...work.  I often love Lenny when he's "bad," but this is really bad.  Boult and Barbirolli achieved 10 times as much in half the time.
1,(I needed to add this second review because I have recently grown to love this album more than most others... I would give it 4 stars if the edit review interface would let me... anyway I was a douche for my original review... I absolutely understand this album now and I love it from top to bottom... especially Pane Of Truth, which really makes me tear up everytime I hear it... and Questions.. two of the best songs I've heard in a long time.. the rest of the album is worth a listen, as well)		[below: original review from 2008]		Okay just a little background here... I'm a huge fan of Prog-rock... oddly enough the first thing I ever heard from Sylvan was their live album where they play this whole album from front to back.. at first listen, I was intrigued by this band.. I imagined to myself "wow.. these guys must be huge overseas, listen to how pretentious this freaking live show is!"  Little did I know that they were playing the album note for freaking note... When I finally got this album and realized that they were really that pretentious, even in the studio - I was dumbfounded.  And another thing... this is supposed to be the return of Sylvan?  They took one year off... Peter Gabriel took over a decade between his last two studio albums.. Guns N Roses took a gazillion years to finally release their new album.. THAT's a freaking return!  One year gone doesn't merit "a return".		The musicianship and production values on this album are definitely top notch.. but the material doesn't have any substance.  After listening to half the album I felt like I hadn't even been listening to songs.. it was just a big wreck of long intro tracks and oddly chosen falsetto singing tones.. the long songs like IN CHAINS begin well enough, but the hooks aren't memorable enough or strong enough to carry a song for 8 minutes.		Classic prog-rock fans - let me help you guys with this analogy.. you know how in the 70's and 80's Rush would play that looooong intro for Xanadu with the bells and woodblocks and chimes??? and it just seemed to last for 20 minutes before they'd finally play the song?  Well this whole album feels like the intro to Xanadu - but they never get to the great song Xanadu, it just keeps teasing and hinting and getting monotonous, etc.		Lastly, I must talk about the cheese factor, which is astronomically high throughout the entire album.  The production is just as slick as anything... maybe too slick for your ears unless you're into 80's Yes sounding production values.  Everything is wet and sludgy.. lots of reverb and ambiance.		I'd recommend just about anything over this album.  I mean, really.. go listen to Duran Duran's RIO album if you want slick production.. or better yet, some Saga.. yeah I said it.. SAGA.  You like long songs??  Get a Porcupine Tree or Dream Theater album.  Or even better, get freakin Frost Milliontown.. now THAT's a freaking prog masterpiece.. or Circus Maximus.. yes indeed, friends.		This album sounds a lot more like Tears For Fears (without the amazing songs and incredible singing) and not at all like Incubus or Faith No More.. I really have no clue where that comparison comes from.. everybody compares Sylvan to Incubus.. I just don't hear it at all.		Remember when Tears For Fears dropped the Seeds Of Love album and you could just hear them becoming more and more full of themselves?  They might have put something like this out eventually if they had really gone crazy with the pretention and delusions of grandeur.  Thankfully the bass player dude quit the band and then Roland Orzabal (sp?) puts out a great synth pop album called Elemental that sounds hungry and humble.		Okay now I think I'm going to go listen to some Tears For Fears for real now.  Elemental is like cotton candy on a CD.
1,I love The Stones ,	 my all time favourite band, I adore the singles era,	 Beggars to Soup contain the best  rock songs Ever written,	 B&B,Girls,and yes Rescue too,Tattoo, Awesome albums...	 I admit to a few problems with Mick's vocal affectations that started to appear in the next period, but overall , i love,  Undercover Dirty work, Bridges and Bang !.	 I listen to them all on a regular basis still	( Not a silly boast,there are guys out there with 10 times my collection,but i have over 3,000 cd,s in to choose from , 1,000 different artists, just making the point that  im not someone who listens to The Stones And only The Stones ) ,	I listen to the Stones entire back catalogue because they always bring me great pleasure.	The only Stones album I cannot listen to is Voodoo Lounge !!!.		  It's the most uninspired piece of trash they ever released.	I feel embarrassed listening to it even in my own company.	I could go on...I won't.	The other  '1 star' reviews have said it all very honestly , and accurately , and often with sadness , which is how I feel .	I desperately want to like this album,  Hey, it's THE bloody ROLLING STONES .	I Hate it .		P.S. ~ Somewhat ironically :)  , I love the last tagged on after thought , '' Mean Disposition'' , is a great little Stones rocker .
1,I bought this CD to hear the music and see what all the buzz was about. Like many of the critical reviews have said, the material on the CD is just too generic and slight. I honestly feel that this probably played alot better live, when you saw the performers with the material. There is no doubt that Jeff and Hunter are talented, but they are also very, very kitchsy which gets very dated very quickly and will rub many people the wrong way. This show flopped on Broadway for a reason. The ideas and themes were never fleshed out enough to resonate with a larger audience who were not "kitschy" themselves or "in the know." The whole show has an irritating "wink" that grates after the first few tracks.		It's very much a show for folks who know the theatre world or the creative process, which is why it flourished off Broadway. It probably could have played for years Off Broadway.		As other reviewes stated, the songs are very slight, likened to cabaret or an open mike night. The only song that draws out real emotion is "Die Vampire Die", so download that one. It's an incredibly smart and moving piece. The rest is just glued together camp and kitsch.		It feels really crummy to criticize this CD knowing the spirit in which it was created and the themes that it covers, but the songs just aren't very memorable, nor is the dialogue that was preserved on this CD.
1,It should first be established that this is not even music PERIOD, this is a ludicrous bedlam of tactless, senseless, depraved, vile, indiscernible, untalented racket that anybody could do by concentrating as much noise as possible together and then adding heinous growling vocals that sounds not much different from a demon gagging and barfing up guts with razors in its throat (even worse than Gollum's episodes).		Cannibal Corpse is the SICKEST, most hideous, gruesome, (everything disgusting you can think about) and in simple terms---downright gross. Anybody that recommends this travesty of music has SERIOUS problems on all echelons of their sanity!		Nobody in their right mind would give this a good rating. In fact. Even if the lyrics weren't so desperately perverted, more enjoyment can come from hearing construction work than this LUNACY. Take my advice, don't listen to anyone giving this 5 stars, because their musical tastes are SERIOUSLY WARPED.		This has another name "the music from hell". It's not even worth checking out. And if you happen to, you'll regret it.
1,this cd sounds like it was recorded with a portable cassette deck sitting next to the speaker of a plastic portable record player.  lovin' spoonful good.  this cd very bad.
1,One glaring problem with Genesis is that since they tended to produce themselves during the seventies (even though a producer was listed) they really weren't self-aware.  It makes logical sense to me that Gabriel left the group since his artistic vision was not necessarily profitable.  I really love the Genesis music from this era (especially "Selling England by the Pound") but what would have happened after the Lamb album?  The band was breaking and deeply in debt due to its own musical and theatrical (creative) weight.  One member who I think the public appreciated and the band needed was Steve Hackett.  An innovative and original guitarist, Steve added a dimension to the bad that was taken for granted by his bandmates, and fully obvious when you listen to the sound of  "...and then there were three..."  compared to the richer "Wind and Wuthering."  I get the feeling that since he was not the original guitarist, the others in the band never fully accepted him as a bona fide "one of the boys" and passed over many of his compositions that he later used in his solo work.  In short, I think that it was more important for the group to maintain their personal and professional comfort level than to keep a valuable member of the group.	Steve left in 1977 when he felt creatively restricted, and the next album "Seconds Out" a live album from this era has Steve's guitar parts lost in the mix and if to say "...not only is Steve gone, but we are going to erase his contribution to the band."  For that reason, "Seconds Out" is a real disappointment.  It should be remixed to the original live sound that was documented.	In Archives, Vol. 2, I see the same practice.  The early post-Gabriel work is eschewed for the later popish eighties stuff recorded after Hackett left.  The inclusion of commercial dance mixes may appeal to the casual radio listener, but there is nothing new for true Genesis fans here.
1,What in the name of all that is holy has happened to Ozzy Osbourne?  The one time godfather of heavy metal and voice of the most legendary band in heavy metal is becoming nothing more than a trendy novelty, and this "album" is proof enough.  Clips from the TV show are abundant, and are a bit funny, but they get grating and just plain annoying.  Not to mention the music selection: "Dreamer", the severely overrated single from the mediocre "Down to Earth" is here, as is Ozzy's classic "Crazy Train" and Sabbath's ever more popular "Paranoid", but we've all heard them before, and they can't save this drink coaster in the making.  Then, there is daughter Kelly's cover of "Papa Don't Preach", and I'll just keep to myself about what I think of that.  It saddens me to see what Ozzy is becoming, I never thought I'd see the day that this would happen.
1,While their last 3 albums still play on my Stereo often this new release just didn't make it. Dimmu Borgir really has to thank their label for all the propaganda done to the album but musically speaking it is a disappointment. Kicking out Mustis was a bad move and to make it worst Vortex is gone too and they made a huge difference in Dimmu's sound.	Only outstanding track is "Gateways", the rest is just a boring Excessively symphonic album.
1,I was very disappointed.  From the interviews when this CD first came out, I thought this would be exciting.  She sings in a monotone, the instrumentation is tedious and sounds the same from track to track.
1,This CD is okay but not worth the money. I have bought many of their CDs in the past and this was my first disappointment.
1,Gift item
1,I'm so tired of these coca cola cowboys with hats that match their outfit, and lyrics that I could have written while takin' a leak behind a walgreens. I remember when I was in the military and he had all these stupid support the troops songs that were horrible, I mean when your in the military you don't wanna hear this war music all dang day and when you get one of these stupid songs stuck in your head, believe me it's a long dam* day. Oh yeah and Terry Clark opened up for him once at a concert of his and made him look like Tito. Hopefully he made a lot of money off of the war so hopefully he can retire from country music and let Randy Rogers or Pat green or somebody with half an ounce of talent correct the wrongs he's made in country music. Man he sucks, ok, i'm done
1,I was actually looking forward to this new album from Gloria Estefan,after all this time...but i am very let down and confused by the common and over used song tracks that she has chosen.		 First the good...Gloria looks and sounds Great and i always thought she had a special way with a strong Ballad and such an ease at making it her own even if it wasn't.....however,i wish she had chosen different  songs that haven't been covered by so many other singers already and with much better results.		Let's face it if your going to record songs that have been done by the likes of Fitzgerald, Streisand ,Cole( Nat & Natalie) , as well as Ronstadt..it would be better to stop right there and go with other material because your never going to improve them especially with a much more limited range of voice.		I am not saying the album is terrible, but just Nothing Special and i clearly see it as a missed musical opportunity to have made something much more substantial.		I do love the cover and as i said Gloria looks amazing, so i hope there will be a follow up to this album with much more thought out choice of lesser recorded and known standards..there are so many to pick from that Gloria can really sink her teeth into vocally.		I do like Gloria and in no way insult her, but this album is just very bland and quite boring and far beneath her talents! Here's hoping for a much better follow up album next year!
1,Didn't like it very much.
1,NSYNC has really backed themselves into a corner this time.  Their fans are going to be dropping like the proverbial flies after the release of this album.  I came up with a name for this supposed new sound of theirs---CRAP.  I don't know why anybody would even buy the CD (I heard the CD through MP3s by the way).  NSYNC really got off on the wrong foot with their least successful single ever "Pop"--or what I like to refer to as "Flop" due to the fact NOBODY likes this song..not even hardcore fans.  In conclusion this CD is crap--but be happy...because fans can only buy crap albums from a band for so long until they give up.  I think NSYNC is about to become EXTINCT after this Dirty Flop.
1,Fact: Geoff Tate was the only original member of Queensryche who had anything to do with this album, and had already been fired from the band for nearly a year at the time of its original release.		Since Tate no longer has any ownership of the Queensryche brand, for this horrid "album" to be (re)released under the band's name is false advertisement at its very best.		It's equivalent to polishing a turd. Sure, the songs may SOUND slightly better due to the new mix. But that doesn't change the fact that they have all the depth and complexity of a Nickelback b-sides collection.		Bottom line: This "deluxe edition" should not have been allowed to see the light of day. Not unlike Frequency Unknown itself.		On a more positive note, the one and only Queensryche fronted by Todd La Torre are releasing their new album sometime in the new year. It is bound to be light years ahead of anything Tate and his band of hired guns will release under the "Operation: Mindcrime" (really?) name.
1,I'm a huge Wu fan ( I even have the Playstation 'Shaolin Style' game) but This Wu-Tang album was complete garbage.  This was BY FAR their worst album.  If you think this album is better than 'The W' then you seriously need your head examined.  There's hardly any good songs and definitely NO CLASSIC SONGS on this joint.  The first problem is they let Masta Killa and U-God rap on the mic TOO MUCH.  Why did they let these lames rap so much?  There is minimal appearances from Ghostface Killah and Method Man, RZA raps too much on this album, absence of ODB, and the beats are SEVERELY LACKING, even with RZA producing some cuts the beats are weak.  The first single off the album ( and only single ) Uzi- Pinky Rings is incredibly lame.  I remember how dissappointed I was when I got this for christmas two years ago.  I had a long list of cd's I wanted but I put this down as a 'must have' and that's what I got.  And it was PURE WACKNESS.  I couldn't even bootleg the cd...nobody wanted it.  The only song worth anything would have to be 'One Of These Days" and it's not THAT good.  If you have this try to sell it and if you thinking about getting this cd keep on thinking.  A Huge disappointment.  I never thought I would do this to the Legendary Wu Tang Clan but this album receives ZERO stars.  Awful.
1,LOUDNESS signed with a major company and immediately sold out, dressing themselves like Dokken, POison, Cinderella, Motley Crue, whatever. Accordingly, the music quality dropped sharply, and they lost whatever chance they have of one day being really great.	HURRICANE EYES is simply awful.
1,I know I'll be using a regular clich by saying this, but this album is the epiphany of the fact Britney has absolutely no vocal power whatsoever. I have bought this album together with Christina's "Striped" and the difference is so overwhelming that I find no words to explain it.	Britney just keeps on meowing and purring throughout the CD and the only saving grace of this album are the excellent background sound effects.	"Me Against the Music" seems so nice only because she takes refuge behind Madonna's and other background voices, otherwise you could have a glimpse of how absurd her voice really sounds in this CD.	Anyway, I will not rush and say this is the beginning of Britney's decay, for great voices have disappeared into oblivion while other not so great voices prevailed, like Madonna's example. Let us wait and see what cards she still has to play (and by the way, she will have to do much better than that wedding gig).
1,After hearing the great work Alice did with a new deeper metal sound on Brutal Planet, i was hoping this album would deliver just as well. But IMO it failed! Only a handful of songs I think were good! It does contain a great, and one of my fav Alice songs, called "Fantasy Man" which is something i feel i can relate to, and found to be a great song. Alice slows down a notch and does another slow song called "Every Woman Has A Name" which seems to be a song about Alice lost a dear friend or something? I'm not sure, but its a nice little number! "DiscrgraceLand" is Alice singing a bit like Elvis as a...well, i wouldn't call it a tribute, its like Elvis has gone to hell and Alice has sung about it!		I really only liked about 4 of the 12 songs on this album.	The rest were very disappointing IMO.... It is my second least fav album by Alice.		This Album just didn't appeal to me and lacked that classic quality that Alice adds to any form of Rock N Roll. It just didn't shine through on this one!		EDIT 6 Years later: The A.C fan can pop this album on a number of times and get used to some of these tracks, "Triggerman" 'n' "Sex, Death & Money" I have learnt to like a lot more now then I did when I first heard them and reviewed this album years ago. however, they sound much better when they where played live as a combined blend of "Sex and Death/Brutal Planet/Dragon Town" but to say those songs have not eventually grown on me is a lie.		And tho I like this album a lot more then I did years ago, there are still songs on this one I can not get into, and believe they are still filler songs the album could do with out. Probably for the first time in my life I would not be against Alice for making a compilation kind of "best of" between this album and Brutal Planet.
1,Well this is not a complete disaster, but taking any amazing bands material and playing with them will rarely even do justice to the originals, let alone emulate them..It is nice to see some of their older lo-fi material get a nice cover of sparkling sheen on top with the reinturpeted tracks..Unfortunately it is always the original brilliance of the writing, not the re-worked beat placements, that fans will appreciate..
1,Interesting that the two French DJs known as Daft Punk would imitate robots, because their music is as mindless and repetitive as something that would come from an automaton.		I've listened to a lot of bad albums, but Discovery stands out as one the most uniquely unpleasant listening experience I've ever had the misfortune of enduring. Not being satisfied with one listen, I instead subjected myself to the entire CD's length at least three times in the vain hope that it would somehow grow on me. Quite the opposite, as I found myself despising it with a greater and greater passion with every listen.		Can one honestly tell me that any effort was put into this CD when nearly every track is repetitive and cylical to a downright ludicrous degree? With the exception of "Digital Love" (the only halfway decent song on the album), each and every song consists of a single hook looped fifty to a hundred times over a simple beat for nearly the entire length of the song. Tracks go nowhere, build to nothing, and only if you're very lucky will they ever change at all. Take "Superheroes" for example, where a single vocal sample repeats for nearly three quarters of the song's duration. This wouldn't be so bad (at least, not nearly as unbearable) if the songs were at least somewhat catchy, but they're not. There's nothing remotely memorable, and at a later time I had difficulty remembering anything about any of the songs. This isn't minimalism; this is music at its most lazy and uncreative. The only circumstance in which the songs on Discovery would be remotely listenable would be if I were high out of my mind, and even then that would be doubtful.		As if maddening repetition were not enough, Discovery is replete with irritating synth samples that sound like they were dredged out of the worst of 80's synth-pop. Vocoder vocals are used throughout, and only create further irritation and disgust. The whole album comes off as sickeningly cheesy and unaware of it. If Daft Punk had conceived this album as a mockery of Dance and House music, it would be a downright brilliant satire. More cynically, Discovery sounds like it was tailor-made for television commercials; each song containing just enough material for a half-minute jingle, and repeated over and over to stretch it out to a full album.		Your tastes might vary from mine, but I don't recall ever disliking an album as much as this one. Most bad music makes me feel either disappointment or boredom, but Daft Punk's Discovery is the first to inspire outright loathing and disgust. To my amazement, I have heard that Daft Punk's latest album "Human After All" is even more repetitive in nature than this.		How is that even possible?
1,get blows against the empire instead of this one for better classic Jefferson starship.
1,Let's just start with the name.  Awful.  Why are we praying for Betty's soul?  Is it because she listens to this god awful cd?  I was told by a friend how great this cd was, so I gave it a whirl.  I'll never get those wasted minutes of my life back.  The whole cd sounds like a demo.  The sound is just not good at all.  It sounds like something the record label popped out just to capitalize on the singer's fame since he was on "American Idol".  This is just bad grunge music.  Ten years too late, but I don't think it would have sounded good back then either.		Constantine Maroulis tries too hard to sound like Scott Weiland, in my opinion.  Whether he growls, uses a megaphone or distorts his voice, he just doesn't come off sounding like he's really into what he's singing.  The first track "Drift" has power, but Constantine's vocals drag the track down.  And, the cd really doesn't recover from there.  "Some Of My F***ed Up World" sounds like a bad knock-off of an STP or a Vines song.  The singer sort of plodds through "...The Day".  "Truck Stop Sally" is just ridiculous.  The whole cd is just one big wannabe attempt to capture the spirit of the great grunge bands of the 90's.  Unfortunately, these guys end up sounding like a bunch of poseurs.		Obviously, Constantine must have some vocal talent.  Otherwise, he wouldn't have made it as far as he did on "American Idol".  Let's hope he hones his skills and his next release isn't this boring.
1,There's no denying that "Nevermind" remains an essentIal, important album by Nirvana.		This latest CD master isn't the one to buy.		It sounds horrible--a loud, compressed, distorted mess.		I'm not clear who approved this master but I would avoid it. Pick up the earlier CD  version or find a decent vinyl copy but don't buy this as it is shoddy.		Nirvana deserve better.
1,Bland, generic, cheesy, and uninspired music. All songs are the same, they start with looong intros, then a female vocal shows up, and then a "climax keyboard" that you have probably heard something similar before.
1,Fist, let me say that this is the first full recording I've ever heard of Rufus.  I've only heard a song or two of his before, and since he is proudly out and gay, I've wanted to hear what his voice and style were like.  Plus, since this concert is SO iconic, I thought this might be an interesting way to discover him. I went into this knowing that there was no way he would be able to top Judy- of course, NO ONE could.	  And the more I heard of it, the more I just didn't like it.  I agree with other reviews here that his interpretations are just lifeless and flat.  His style is just TOO laid back, which doesn't work for a lot of these songs.  The energy just isn't there- it sounds like he just woke up and hasn't had coffee yet.	  Plus, there's 2 aspects of his performance that just irritated me.  One is how he seems to slide up to a lot of notes, instead of just hitting them.  And the worst on is his pronunciation of "e" words- me, she, he, etc.  He sounds like he's saying heh, sheh, meh.  Call me picky, but that just bugged the hell out of me. I can't stand singers that can't pronounce the words they're singing clearly.	  The orchestra is really good, plus I do give Rufus points for undertaking such a program, so I gave it 2 stars, but that's it.  If you're a big Rufus fan, you'll have to have it.  But it you're a really fan of the songs, go get the original- NOTHING can top that!
1,This is the second copy of the album I have bought, and probably the last. The first copy burned up in a fire. The second, which my wife bought me to replace the original copy, broke when I attempted to remove it from the spindle it was mounted on.		 The original copy I had of The Early Years Volume 2 was a normal plastic jewel case, and there was no problem with taking it off the spindle. But the new packaging (Manifesto MFO 40602) has the CD mounted on an extremely tight plastic spindle that forces you to bend the CD when removing it. There is no "button" action to press that would release the CD, so the result is, the CD bends enough where it pops off, or it simply breaks. (I also have Tom Waits The Early Years Volume 1, which has the same spindle problem, but fortunately did not bend enough to break. I am now treating it with extreme care!)		 As for the music on the CD (which I am familiar with thanks to the original copy which was destroyed by fire), it is truly wonderful: it reveals an acoustic and stripped down side of Tom Waits where you really see a side to his soul without the distractions of exaggerated blues influences or unusual musical arrangements. But there is no point buying a great CD if you can't listen it. Wait until Manifesto makes a quality case, or buy an older version, if you can find it.
1,While the mastering on this one isn't as dreadful as on "From the Corner to the Block", it is bad.  There is a large amount of dynamic compression, a fair amount of distortion and clipping.  All in all, I give the mastering a 2 out of 5.  I'll leave it for the other reviewers to review the music.		I bought 4 Galatic disks, and only one of them was shown care and attention when being mastered and that was "Coolin' Off".  Batting .250, cest la vie.		Oh and if you want to know more, look up 'loudness war' at wikipedia.
1,Loved by hundreds, hated by millions, it's......Virtual XI!! I rated this two stars, but that's a bit harsh coz I think this album is better than it's said to be. It probably seems rotten if you put it up against Maiden's other albums. Honest and truly, Virtual XI really isn't that bad. You might gag upon your first listen, but listen to it a few more times and you'll find that some of these songs do grow on you. Of course, if you have it in for Blaze, you won't even give this album the time of day. If you're open to the Blaze albums, however, don't be afraid to give it a shot, and don't be afraid to say you like it if you do. Sure, there are things here that are kind of juvenile for Iron Maiden. One thing you'll walk away remembering is, "Don't you think I'm a saviour? Don't ya think I can save ya? Don't you think I can save your life?" You'll remember this coz it's sung 22 times throughout the song!  For a moment you'll almost think you fell into a Meatloaf song. Maiden are capable of better. Yes, it has a very bad reputation amongst Maiden fans, but it's really worth a listen. If you're a fan, you owe it to the guys to at least do that.
1,This is the last mc cd I got now I have replaced al my lp's. why was this my last, well this was a low point for Mc the songs in the most part are weak at best.... yes a few were good, but most were soft. M jackson was Mc's down fall and mccartney is still trying to reach 1# one after all these year's. Don't get me wrong I'm a true Mccartney fan, and have all his stuff and his stuff after this mess should have reached high on the charts. It took the wind from him. Rock on Paul!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
1,Well, it doesn't get much worse than this.  I guess there was no way to go but up from this point. There is a lot of music that is worth going back in time for.  This isn't it.
1,Chimaira is slowly becoming the worst band to ever have crawled out from the pits of *hitty nu-metal. As many of you are aware of, they started out as a flaccid Mushroomhead/Tool/Slipknot wannabe 6-piece group, which includes a DJ. Since they were late starters, they never got to wallow in there own *hit long enough to make millions, so they had to find a new genre to jump onto like the leeches they are, and what not better than the equally trendy and talentless genre of metalcore.		Now, after two albums of faceless metalcore (h4Rdc0Re P1t MuS1k!), Chimaira's music executives and stock investers warned them about metalcore's inevitable failure. So, what not to infest then psuedo-death metal? Now, we get to this abomination of all that is good.		Since Chimaira got bored of stealing Pantera riffs, they now steal Suffocation and Morbid Angel riffs, and the drums are nothing to write home about either (Andols Herrick is a joke. He is neither talented, nor even worth a listen without his triggers. Oh and speed? Vitek of Decapitated and James King of Origin eats this guy alive).		As for Mark Hunter, he is not worth a mention (Guess this makes this sentence a hypocritical statement then).		Where does the verdict fall? This is another reason why the metal scenes these days are *hit. No longer do bands even attempt to come up with there own stuff, now they just opt to rip off Kreator and At the Gates and give themselves a "tuff und br00tal" name, and call it a day, meanwhile having sound engineers and vocal enhancers paint their sound to make up for their absent talent. Bands like Chimaira and Trivium makes me wish upon metal a quick death so it can no longer be tainted by this filth.		If you want good metal, get Dissections Storm of the Lights Bane and Decapitated's Winds of Creation. It sickens me that talented musicians like Jon Ndtveidt and Chuck Shuldiner have to die, while these talentless clowns are alive and breathing.		.....
1,For all the five stars awarded by other listeners, I would expect unforgettable melodies.  There are none.  Despite the new age marketing, this is actually electronic pop that did not drive me away as much as never compelled me to listen again.
1,There's a sketch from SCTV where Rick Moranis impersonates Perry Como by singing a song so unenthusiastically, with so little emotion, and with so little energy, that he sings it while lying in bed or lying on the floor, half asleep. On this CD, Kate Bush is doing a wonderful impression of Rick Moranis doing Perry Como. WHERE'S THE ENERGY? WHERE'S THE EMOTION? Kate's voice is still gorgeous but what happened to her balls? Without that power, her voice just flutters away into nothingness.		I've listened to the album almost everyday for a week; unfortunately, it's not growing on me. In fact, I get angrier every time I listen to it. Sorry, Kate. I adore your voice and your music... but Aerial is a travesty.
1,Alicia Keys is not all that on wax. Her album is so mediocre. There is nothing special about it. What's all the fuss for? Is it because she can play a few tunes on the piano? I bought her cd in Aug sometime and haven't paid it no mind since. Im so curious to see what she will do on her next album. Hopefully everyone won't be so blinded by her sophmore effort that they won't be able to give a realistic opinion. One Love
1,By far and away.....no questions....only for completists.  This is where the dreadful box set gets it right.  Only two good songs.  The very rock and rolling it's Hot Tonight and You and Me.  Besides these two enigmas I have no idea what Alice was thinking.  Even as a total drunk (i mean this respectfully) this is the worst piece of drivel Alice ever did.  Check out DADA or the two MCA releases.....God forbid.....the nadir of his career.  Everyone has to get back on their feet.  Beware all fans and new fans, unless you have everything else that Alice has committed to tape please pass.  Nothing here that, unfortunately, deserves any attention.
1,This is actually a horrible recording, simply terrible, and I have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. Quite a contradiction, isn't that. Well, not really, this is VERDI, and well, this goes to show that no matter how horrible the singers are, how boring the conductor is (and he is really dull most of the time) and how expressionless the entire concept of the opera as a whole is, it is still great music. And it still can just sweep you away.		Unlike a few reviewers think, THIS IS CLASSICAL OPERA. There is no such thing as popular opera, even if there are many operas that are well loved and constantly in the repertoire of all opera companies. Carmen is one of the most beloved operas, as is Aida, but no one would dare to call them "popular opera" and then wish them sung by pop stars. Trovatore was written and premiered in 1853, that is over 150 years ago, that is no longer popular. Besides, even when it was the most popular opera around and all its tunes could be heard on barrel organs around the country, there was still a standard required by the singers singing it.		This opera, like all opera, requires good voices, ones with real "squillo." (this term is an Italian term meaning, RING, penatrating power, something not to be confused with volume or loudness, though it is more evident while singing loudly, but is always present so that delicate pianissimo notes carry to the furthers corners of the theatre). Until recently, that was the only idea a manager or a theatre or a company would consider; do the voices have the necessary "squillo", and energy to make the music move forward dramatically. Sadly, no one thinks of that anymore, and now that more and more people who have never seen live opera, or even heard the real human voice in its natural state unaided by microphones, are learning to enjoy opera, they are learning to enjoy something that is simply fake. One is not hearing the real voice at all, but a manufactured one created by recording engineers.		Recording engineers love weak non-descript voices because they are a dream to record, and you can do all sorts of mixing and stuff to create a sound that simply doesn't exist. Real voices that contain all the squillo, all the upper and lower overtones (the ones needed for works like this) don't record well, and are an engineer's nightmare. The equipment simply can't handle the sound.		As a result, more and more recordings that are simply horribly sung by completely the wrong voices for the music are being released. This is one of those. It isn't that each and every singer is all that horrible (though they are not great), it is simply we are not hearing the truth. I really care less if someone who loves Bocelli (and I am a really big fan of his, when he is singing the correct music for his voice) or the more "popular false recording creations" singing this music comments that they like the opera better now it resembles the popular stuff they are used to listening to. Good for you, but for those of us who know what this music is about, well, all we can say to you is, it is time to learn something about the music now you have opened your mind enough to even listen to it.		Now to the meat of the review. Firstly, let us start with Bocelli. His voice is completely wrong in this role, and in the closing of the first act it is reduced to chirps here and there when singing with the other singers. It does improve as the opera progresses, but the STRAIN is so evident in all he is singing, and as with all his opera recordings, there is virtually no character development at all. He has no clue whatever about the personality he is trying to recreate. Some of the music is sloppy and not always in time with his accompaniment or the other singers, but for the most part, it is a more successful interpretation than anything he has previously done, though it has nothing to offer someone who understands the play and characters.		Veronica Villarroel was a complete bore, for the most part. Her introductory aria reminded me of Tebaldi when singing the last phrases of Mimi in La Boheme just before she dies! And just think, Leonore has three more acts to sing before she dies. This was about the most lifeless and directionless performances of this role I have ever heard. She did improve in other parts of the opera, and of course, her last act has much to recommend it. Her voice sounded super pushed at times, but something tells me that was more the fault of engineering than of her singing. I must say, I really did enjoy her scenes much more than when Bocelli sang, for she did feel them a bit more, one was certain some type of emotion was being expressed, even though it was hard at times to figure out what it was.		Elena Zaremba really disappointed me. She came alive later in the opera, but her voice is far too pushed and she sings with a very heavy delivery. Her introductory "stride le vampa" was more a lesson in how to gargle with mouthwash than a real presentation of the music. Her trill was simply horrible and sounded nothing like a trill at all, but rather some strange bumping of her glottis. She does not sing the high C in her duet with Manrico, which was sad, for her A was quite good, and one thought that the C would not be beyond her. However, she was very good in act three, and her ending phrases of Act four were wonderful.		Carlo Guelfi sang well, but was simply forgettable. Now this is sad, he was one singer who actually had a good techique, and seemed to have some idea what his part was all about, but he had no ability to make his voice and interpretation even memorable.		Basically, this opera was sung by "non-descript stock singers."		The conductor's interpretation was more than dull.		The packaging, however, was very beautiful, only one was instantly aware that Decca saw this completely as a "Bocelli recording." His picture is all over the place, and the conductor gets a shot, but no other principle is seen at all. The booklet contains the necessary but uselessly uniformative history of the work (something so well knows it is a waste of paper to write it each and every time the work is recorded), and nothing whatever about the singers (most of whom you have never heard of, or not much of). Recording companies are getting super stupid that way, they record something and hope we don't care who is singing, when in reality, the singers are the ones that make or break a recording (or even a performance; not even super creative strange and new stagings do a thing if the singing is horrible, and if the staging is simply terrible good singing can save an otherwise failure of a performance and concept of a work). I happen to be one who wants to knew about the singers and what their experience is. I think it adds to understanding the recording one is listening to. It also helps to know if the singer has experience with the work, or if they are coming to it new. Experience adds a lot. Anyway, we have some really good up and coming singers, but if we are never told much about them, how can we know who to watch out for? And there are some pretty terrible ones that are forced on to us, and don't we have the right to know who to avoid? I do feel insulted, and most people who love opera do as well, by the endless retelling of the plot (those who buy the opera for the most part know that), or the boring history around the writing of the opera. I would rather read the explanations of the singers/conductor of what they are trying to present, or how they envision the work, than all that boring stuff that has been printed and reprinted ad nauseum in every issuing and reissuing of a given work, especially the super well known ones (it is different if one is finding a work really quite unknown, then background information is a must; but even then, so is learning about the singers who are recreating the music for us to enjoy).		Horrible as the recording is, there is still a great deal of pleasure to be enjoyed listening to it. If you like Bocelli, buy it for him; if you are well versed in good singing, buy it anyway so you can see just how well Verdi's genius stands up to abuse, and truly great music will each and every time survive bad performances.
1,I highly anticipated hearing original, new work from Cyndi Lauper as she is truly a fascinating artist -- one-of-a-kind.  This is not the typical Cyndi most of us know, however.  BYTTB is entirely a club album, and you're not going to hear much of this music on the radio.  If you want Cyndi of the past, this ain't it.  If you didn't know for certain, for most of this record, you wouldn't realize it's Cyndi Lauper.  The music is very techno-beat, repetitive, and is not as good as Madonna's "Confessions."  If you want a different Cyndi, try her outstanding "Hat Full of Stars."  (Superb!)  How many times can you stand hearing the same line over and over, song after song?  And what's with the artwork?  Trailer park, white-trash Cyndi?  Low class.  Donna Summer has made a similar return to the music scene after a lengthy absence, just like Cyndi, but Donna's record is far more listenable and 'musical' (though a different Donna in some ways).  Cyndi's record is not even close.  Sorry, folks.  I'm giving this record away.
1,I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.	However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here.  Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed.  If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only.  Disappointing.  I already own the videos on DVD - so I haven't taken that into consideration in this review.
1,Juelz santana's "what the game's been missing"  is horrible. Production wise, lirical wise and over all just plain wack. Okay i give these weak rappers chances but they are truly wack! Juelz santana's rhymes does not make any sense and he proved that on his "santana town" song if you payed any close attetion to that song ?  You'll hear bunch of nothing. I quess  the mainstream mtv audience will get buy anything as along as its "pop" and "cool" what a shame. Dipset, gay unit, and these mtv2 rappers are whats killing the real hip hop and rap music nowdayz. By the way Juelz santana if your reading this ? Remenber "chu chu train" thats one of  your lines ni gga! How can you call yourself a rapper? Well i quess even if lil john is a consider a rapper & a real producer anything is possible right ? Krs one  would destroy your none sense rhymes in a second dude. Just my opinion. Peace out!
1,Udo has a rock & roll voice, and I saw him when he was the front man for "ACCEPT".  He's a rock & roller and can belt out those songs like a professional.  And the 2 guitarist are truly great guitarist, as good as Randy Rhodes in my book.
1,Hey guys please stop doing reissues over and over and over.  We are sick of this. Gilmour and Waters  just put your differences away and make a new album with a new wolrd tour.  Your faithfull fans all over the world deserve that.  It is time to treat us with a little respect.	Nothing new in this box set!!!	Two stars because is Floyd.
1,What is one to say of a performance of the Requiem that is actually more dead than the poor bugger in the box?		By all means bring out the grandeur of the score - it warrants it - but why transform K 626 into an elegy for the Nineteenth Century?		This is Obesity Central; everything about this recording is bloated and coarsely so. I would not be surprised to hear that the Huddersfield Choral Society, circa 1910, was somehow involved in this venture. Worse still, Uncle Karl makes Erich Honecker seem like Jim Morrison. He's uber-slow, mechanical and more funereal than an undertaker. Listen to the Rex Tremendae: Uncle Karl might as well be driving a tractor on his potato farm. Nor is he helped by the thousand-strong choir (if Lenny was in town at the time, they should have tackled the Mahler 8th in the same session). Again, listen to the Rex Tremendae and their first entry: how crude it is - and the opacity of the recording means that there is little or no differentiation between the SATB. The shrieks of the Damned are to be heard in the Confutatis but it has nothing to do with Hell.  The Agnus Dei is almost unlistenable - it sounds like a Brahms Requiem on steroids but that is doing a disservice to Johannes. The Vienna Philharmonic play well enough  - for Bruckner. Edith Mathis, normally one of my favourite singers, sounds as if she is trying to emulate Joan Baez in her over-use of vibrato; Ridderdbusch lacks `sepulchral resonance' in his lower register. The tenor and alto are OK but nothing special.		Ever so thoughtfully, DG has bolted together the Requiem Aeternam with the Kyrie (there is no separate track listening for the latter). There are synergies here with Dr Who's Tardis whose physical dimensions were belied by its interior. Here, the clock says it lasts 9'39" (which is frightful in itself), but in actual fact it is your chance to be Methuselah. And indeed, who does not feel penitential after hearing this Kyrie . . .		Speaking of which, it is time for a . . . . . . . `Soup Off'. Yes, Uncle Karl versus Herbie the Chef (re his 1963 recording&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mozart-Requiem-KV-626/dp/B00005MJ17/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mozart: Requiem KV 626</a>). Who is the Soup-Meister? Mister Minestrone or Maestro Chick-Pea Broth? It is not easy to answer this question. Both of them are marmoreal, lugubrious and afflicted with a terrible recording.  There is a suavity to the Herbie performance which predicates control even if it is noxious to the listener. Uncle Karl should win this on points: his choir is clearly off the leash.		Bohm was a fine Mozartian but this travesty does little to keep his memory evergreen. Say what you like about Period Practice - and I have said plenty - nowadays monstrosities of this mettle are unthinkable and for that we should offer up a Te Deum.

1,I do not know if I like it or not. I still do not have it.  I orederd before xmas ... Just waiting :(
1,I'm not sure what made me buy this, and when I played it I thought I had made a big mistake. It just tries too hard to be cool and unmoved. But then I got to track 8 - "Waiting". This is a seriously creative piece on music making. And here Juliet connects emotionally as well.		I strongly advise purchase of the mp3 of this track because you will hear so much more than the sample gives you. The arrangement is innovative perfection (two words that rarely sit well together).		If you are considering buying the cd, let me warn you that the artwork is a complete mess. The lyrics are hard to read and some are virtually illegible. Just like the music, the artwork tries to keep you at a distance.		And as other reviewers have noted, the copy protection is bad enough to make you angry. Unless I agree to the licence agreement and subsequent digital invasion by the record company (I didn't, so I have no idea what the added content is) none of my computer's media players will recognise the cd and play it. So the artist suffers. And I'm not even trying to copy anything. I just wanted to listen to the cd while I wrote the review.
1,These tracks are hardly "overlooked gems"; they have been constantly re-issued (at least annually) by Columbia/Sony since Aretha hit the big time after her move to Atlantic in 1967. There is not one new track. From Aretha's eight excellent original Columbia lps the label has continuously milked her catalog to death, under dozens of new titles and concepts, all the while releasing precious few unrelased tracks from ths vaults. Any Aretha fan already has every track on this cd 5 times over.	Buy the original 8 Columbia albums (all available on cd, including 2 for 1 offers) becuase every Aretha fan needs each one! Skip all these shoddy compilations.
1,Call it Freak Out, call it the 60's Live sessions, call it Nobody Likes Me, call it blood on my chopper, call it the freak out song, call it Nobody Likes Alice, call it simply Alice Cooper, and now just add LIVE onto the end of it and here is this same live performance from 1968 that often gets classified as some kind of RARE performance that will be lucky if it gets a second listen from anyone who hears it the first time.		1. Ain't That Just Like A Woman	2. Painting A Picture	3. For Alice	4. I've Written Home to Mother	5. Freak Out Song	6. Goin' To The River	7. Nobody Likes Me	8. Science Fiction	9. "Medley-Ain't That Just Like A Woman,Goin' To The River"		If you wanna hear one of those boring albums that sound like someone tripping on acid trying to find new psychedelic sounds to wow the minds of the hippies back in the 60's, then you will love this album, other wise, skip this and go to when Alice Cooper discovered who they where and got it right.
1,I bought this CD based on the hype and Bobby's work on Layla. However, one quick listen reveals why he was a side man for a fairly narrow genre of blues/rock. The songs are weak and the arrangements amateurish. Whitlock's vocals are overly earnest...evoking a "poor, poor pitiful me" tone rather than a solid blues delivery. The musicianship from everyone on these CDs (it's a 2 CD set) is lack-luster and uninspiring. I was looking for something that would be a take off from his Layla work, but that's really as far as he got.
1,Justin Bieber is proof that pop music has sunk to it's lowest level EVER!  This is 'dumbed down' music for the musically stunted.  How sad indeed.
1,Her voice is really wrecked here. I guess that's what hard living does to a person. She really should have treasured and cultivated her talent instead of destroying it with drugs. Such a shame, at her peak she really was unparallelled. I won't be listening to this again any time soon.
1,All the songs on this album are mediocre and you can enjoy the same type of music on other albums from other better bands. The songs are just not that catchy and the singer's voice is whiny. On top of that, they wasted a whole lot of my time in concert because they sucked and i did not enjoy any of it. If u have the money to buy this, buy sumthing else instead.
1,another one trick pony group.no talent at all.they do run of the mill music and it is really bad.you can put all the boy bands together and you might get one good song? no you won't.
1,I loved Tupac and the Outlawz were dope on Tupac's records. But I have to say this CD wasn't all that. I only liked four songs out of the 17 tracks, "This is the Life", "Ya'll Cant Do", "Boxspring Boogie" and "Loyalty". As you will tell when you listen, these are the better uptempo fire tracks. Most of the others are slow tracks and try to talk about social issues, but the Outlawz just don't pull that off like Tupac could, which is what the Lawz are trying to do. But I can only feel them when they do tracks that are uptempo, loud and angry. The Lawz are at their BEST when they are coming with HEAT. Leave the slow stuff to someone else to do. When they come aggressive they sound like how Tupac wanted them to, like Thug Life West Side Outlaw Riders!!
1,I guess you either get this guy or you don't. Thought I would, but I haven't been able to.
1,lately the missus has been missing. the music is not flowing, song to song. there is no connection in feeling. i am not talking themes I am talking flow and feel. a sense that the songs make some step by step direction to one place. The last couple do not . this one, an earlier one does not. Children Running yeah that did. i love her singing always but edit girl. just because you like it well, i'll just say filler and filler aint good.
1,i've seen this band live a couple of times. only because they were touring with machine head. and another time i don't remember who else, maybe in flames. they start drawing you in with cool riffs then they start to wimp out with their wanna be hetfield vocals. then their songs just turn to the same old cookie cutter unoriginal riffs. i did start to listen to most of the album but could not get through it. the intro was cool then got long and uneventful, in waves starts out awesome then he starts to sing and the guitars puss out, inception of the end is messy and boring, dusk dismantled is just there nothing cool really happens, watch the world burn - embarrassing, black- sounds like a million other songs except for the bridge was cool, a skyline's severance- very forgettable, ensnare the sun- sounds like something form the game prince of persia, built to fall - 80's sounding fist pumping let down, caustic...-very metallica like, chorus is lame, forsake not the dream- very melodic but his singing oh my god please some producer tell him to stop, the rest of the album sounds like the rest. my favorite song on this album is slave new world. and they did not write it. thank you sepultura.
1,I want to be as Objective as possible in this review. I will say that My Own Prison was an incredible piece of work and I never thought that this little band with this cool hard sound would ever become as popular as they are now. I find that many people hate on them simply because they are so popular, and these rock-demi-god fans swear they know what IS and ISN'T rock music. I find that between the incredible and lame bands, somewhere in the middle lies Creed.	Human Clay was definetly a weird place for Creed and I was hoping they would go a completly different direction with Weathered. Well they did and they didn't. Its safe to say that I was pleasantly surprised to hear alot of the OLD Creed sound in this record, songs like "Freedom fighter" and "Signs" remind me of "Unforgiven" and "In America" from My Own Prison. Other new tracks are completly new territory for the Band, as the highly acclaimed song "Bullets" and the 8 minute "Who's got my back" are really great songs, and its nice to hear Creed attempt to sound different.	Now granted the Human Clay creed is still around and in full throttle but the lame tracks such as "Faceless Man" and "Never Die" are replaced with better song writing like in "One last breathe" and "weathered". "Don't stop dancing" is the next "With arms wide open," which was the "Whats this Life For" of human clay. Its a great song but be prepared to be sick of it once its played out on the radio.	It ends with Lullaby, a sweet but completely unoriginal song. While stapps lyrics seem to be getting more hopeful but do hum on the edge of cornball at times. As the record ends with "Just give love to all.." we wonder if Stapp has lost his edge, and how the bands claim to being "un-christian" simply isn't backed up by the package. Stapp has to face it sometime, I don't believe he's left his faith behind as he claims.	Its a worth while record that shows that Creed still can Rock hard and even surprise their fans. It backs up the Hype, but if you hated them before you won't love them now. This record is for the fans and it shows.	PS. This is the worst CD Cover I have ever seen, and pretty prideful if u ask me. They are being CARVED into wood by uhh God or sumthing? With graphics that look like a low budget 80's metal CD. Guys give it up, go with photography like on MY OWN Prison. The inside pages have more horrible CG pics.	Added Note: After a few weeks, I haven't played this CD much, but can enjoy it on occasion. So I would say its a CD you will like, but eventually forget about after a few months. (Like Human Clay)
1,Think about it.  Who's going to buy this?  Thank God it's limited--at least they admit they'll try to get a quick buck and run.  If you're really into rare live Doors material, chances are you'll go out and get the full double-disc sets from Bright Midnight that this single disc is culled from.	BUT, of course, this disc has tracks appearing nowhere else.  So now you can kindly pay the Doors once again for material you already have (if you get the other sets.)	The Doors will pretty much never miss a chance to sell you something you already have.  I love this band, but the treatment of the live and recorded output by both band and record company has been shameless.  At least they got Bright Midnight going.  (After claiming that the tapes they're releasing now didn't exist.)  But hey, they already got fans to buy a box set that had yet another greatest hits in it as well as another box set of studio albums remastered yet again...and didn't even both releasing the non-Morrison Doors albums.	If you can find this used somehow, get it to hear the stuff that hasn't been released on other Bright Midnight discs.  Otherwise, go and get the full shows.  The Doors are rich enough already.
1,I took a chance and ordered the Japanese import of Jon Anderson's Animation after I heard how awful the Opio Media/Voiceprint release sounds.  Don't waste your money and don't believe any reviews you read claiming it sounds better.  The Arcangel disc is actually the same Opio Media/Voiceprint disc repackaged in a mini-LP cover.  Seriously, it is THE SAME DISC -- all the way down to still saying Opio Media and even showing Voiceprint's catalog number right on the disc.  Only the cover is different.  Also, regarding what some others have posted, I do NOT believe this disc is remastered from an LP.  Only the two bonus tracks have pops indicating they come from vinyl.  The actual album tracks sound like they were taken from a cassette tape played on a deck with the tape head slightly out of line.  Misaligned tape heads typically produce the muffled, muddy, dead mid-tone sound that appears on this remaster.  I am now listening to my 26 year old copy of Animation on LP and it sounds light years better than the "remastered" CD release.  Please contact Voiceprint Records (via their website contact info).  Urge them to remaster this CD and make it sound as good as the LP still does.
1,Prior to this album, Rick Ross use to just put out mixtapes. Back then he was alright but he had some potential. On here he just sounds lazy as hell. The most annoying thing about this album is Rick Ross's using adlibs to finish his rhymes ALL OVER THE ALBUM! If that doesnt scream laziness, I don't know what does. Push It and Hustlin were okay singles even though the latter song is highly overrated. Blow and Cross That Line(feat Akon) are also good singles too. Unfortunately thats where it stops. Im Bad is boring. Boss, For Da Low, White House and It Aint A Problem have some dope beats but Rick Ross's elementary rhymes schemes makes listening to those tracks a chore. The super-cheesy Get Away feat Mario Winans sounds like bad 80s music and we will leave it at that. That's not the only song for the ladies that fails miserably. Hit U From The Back is another lame cut that would get you slapped senseless by that significant other. Pots And Pans is a joke. Lyfe Jennings makes a bad decision by showing up on the tepid Its My Time. Lloyd shows up on the forgettable Street Life and Lil Wayne busts the worst verse of his respective rap career on Im A G. Hustlin Remix feat Jay-z and Young Jeezy was a terrible collabo and all Jay-z did was reword Rick Ross's verse from the original. Where My Money sounds exactly like a cross between Hustlin and Money On My Mind. Bottom Line: Rick Ross's Port Of Miami is one of the worst releases to come out of Miami. Instead of putting some effort into his songs, he just spits lazily over some dope beats. In the long one don't even bother picking up this album. Just let catch dust on the store shelves and bargain bins like it should. Standout Tracks: PUSH IT, BLOW, HUSTLIN and CROSS THAT LINE.		PS: Is anybody the least surprised that we have a top 500 reviewer giving this dookie LP 4 stars? Of course not. Now you have a reason not to take these whackos seriously.
1,Please, Ruben! Don't waste your voice on trashy lyrics and join the throng of disgusting rappers. Oh, too late.
1,I put this CD in my iTunes library because the buzz was that it's really good, and because I had free access to it. Thus I thought, what the hell, even though Rap-Rock has repeatedly proven itself to be a reprehensible b^st^rd, I'll still load it up and give it a fair listen. And currently this CD has over 1100 five star reviews, so it must be pretty darn good, right? WRONG! It's just plain awful. Seriously. However, I am not so closed-minded that I don't have the capacity to understand how this CD might be appealing to someone who is simply too young to have a base of musical experience broad enough to be reasonably perspicacious. But if you are any older than 30, you should certainly be able to recognize this CD for what it is; a steaming puddle of butt mud. If you are over 30, have this CD, and find that you enjoy any aspect of it, you in the simplest of terms are an idiot. But that's alright, with hundreds of reviewers giving this CD a five star rating, idiots aren't exactly a rarity. And besides, I'm pretty sure you know that you are an exception, you're the intelligent person that enjoys this CD, no question.		Now, unlike most, I am not going to simply say that 'Hybrid Theory' suck#, and then not give reasons why I believe it does. Anyone with an uncommon viewpoint should at least be willing to give a reason or two why they think what they do.		Well, I listened to this CD with an open mind, and with no expectations, and even though I tried, I just could not find a redeeming quality. The musicianship is feeble (With no guitar work that extends beyond a few seconds.), the lyrics are truly vacuous, and the dual vocals are banal and monotonous. With this CD Linkin Park demonstrate only minimal instrumental and lyrical ability, and clearly reveal themselves to be nothing more than a glorified Rap-Rock boy band. But what's even worse is that I've actually seen these tools appear to take themselves seriously, and have the effrontery to act as if they are a significant band worthy of serious consideration. Their pretentiousness was appalling and revolting. Yeah, I know they've sold millions of albums, but so what, so did 'N Sync. And yes, that is a reasonable comparison, as LP is just as close to being a 'hybrid' boy band as they are to being a 'hybrid' nu metal band.		While most will describe Linkin Park and their songs as "angry and aggressive", in actuality this particular CD proves to be nothing more than a 40 minute lyrical moanathon. In fact, if you read the lyrics you will see that from start to finish they are just plain whiny. Now, even though the incessant whining becomes really annoying, it is tolerable. However, what's not tolerable is the fact that in addition to the whining there is nearly zero optimism to be found. As a whole the lyrical message this CD conveys is; I'm really down, I'm still sinking, and I don't know what to do. As opposed to; I'm really down, but back the f *** up, because I'm going to get up and kick some as$. Kickin' as$ is what Rock is all about; it's not about being down and conceding defeat. Lamenting inexorable downtroddenness is what Blues is about and for. However, I've heard Blues with more buoyancy than this twaddle. Linkin Park's pathetic lyrical approach to these obviously contrived angst ridden songs is laughable at best. But just in case you didn't know, this "angry" LP crew are in reality middle-class white boys straight outta Agoura Hills. You know, Agoura Hills, CA; a well-known hotbed for uber-p! s$ed youths, where sadly the median family income is only a mere $100K. As one very astute professional reviewer put it; "It might be easier to believe in all this angst if the group members didn't take such pains to thank their families in the lengthy acknowledgments in the CD booklet, followed by an extensive list of product endorsements. But even without the fine print to undermine its sincerity, Linkin Park sounds like a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style."		While Linkin Park's ridiculous posturing is obviously fooling countless fools, don't fall prey, and don't buy into the carefully manufactured hype. There is quite simply nothing substantive here to justify it. If you want to hear some angry Rap-Rock that's genuine get a Rage Against The Machine CD. RATM is a pioneer of the Rap-Rock genre, and the pioneer of angry Rap-Rock. But unlike Linkin Park, RATM has proficient musicianship and respectable non-contrived lyrics. Furthermore, RATM's angry lyrics are proactive, and are primarily aimed at political and social injustice. There is no woe-wallowing or unjustifiable despair stemming from what amounts to little more than having a bad day.		In conclusion, please don't make the same mistake I did; avoid this CD at any cost. And even if you can get it for free like I did, when it's all over, just the fact that you spent your time listening to this CD will make you feel like you've been f###ed over, and aurally befouled.		What you have just read is my honest (and what I am sure will be unpopular) opinion. And even though I believe that I've given valid reasons why I think this CD is nearly unlistenable, I am certainly under no delusion that my review will change the views of any LP fans. So the only thing left to say is; bring on the unhelpful votes d! p$h!+$.
1,Definitely not worth purchasing.  I fell for it yet again, I was expecting this to make up for BRAVA, but was suckered into even more RECYCLED TRASH.		Que perdida de tiempo. Volvi a caer!! Crei que Bravisima seria mejor y no fue asi. Solamente fue mas basura recyclada, que pena.
1,I'd like to be clear that the lower score has nothing to do with Stevie and the guy's five star quality playing.  The lower score is the product it's self.		I eagerly waited to get my hands on it when it first arrived.  It has great packaging, and outstanding little booklet, and even a DVD!  It looked promising!		Sadly, upon further review, after the nifty packaging it's really down hill from there.  As a hardcore SRV fan, I was sooo disappointed in this box set.  Actually, more confusion than disappointment.  Who is the target audience?  Hardcore or casual fans?		There are some great hidden gems and obscure cuts that will please the hardcore fan, and there are some bits and pieces of studio work from Stevie's published library that will help the casual fan.  But mixing the two is downright annoying.		This really could have been a great double disc by doing two things:		1. Drop the studio cuts that can be found elsewhere in Stevie's collection and		2. Cut the DVD.  You can get more in depth live stuff on other DVDs		That would theoretically drop the box set price to please hardcore fans with the hidden gems.  With the extra savings, causal fans would have enough $$ left over to pursue any number of options such as any combination of Stevie's records, greatest hits or Austin City Limit or El Mocambo DVD's.		My guess, like so many other artists no longer with us, the big record label machine took over and had it's sticky paws over the construction of this mess.
1,I'll start by explaining that I'm not a huge fan of Death Cab for Cutie and that this was the first CD I've purchased from them. So take that into account when you read this. Judging by the fairly positive response this CD's gotten here so far I'll assume this CD's par for the course for this band, but I found it incredibly boring. One low to mid-tempo track follows another for the entire CD...they all sound the same, they all lack any sort of hook, and all lack any excitement whatsoever. It's the type of CD where after listening for a while you'll forget you even had it on.		Soul Meets Body was easily one of the best songs I'd ever heard, and yet still I didn't buy Plans, the CD that was on. Determined not to make that mistake again, I checked out this CD, Narrow Stairs, after LIKING (but not loving) the single I Will Possess Your Heart (the long intro's really the only thing that makes the song stand out)...unfortunately, even that "good" song isn't matched by anything else on this CD.		The only tolerable songs on it were, of course, the 1st single I Will Possess Your Heart (what a surprise that it's much faster and more melodic than...anything else on the CD) Bixby Canyon Bridge (incredibly annoying outro aside,) and Your New Twin Sized Bed. That's it. After several listens those are the only songs that stood out in any way for me, those are the only ones that seem to do anything but drone on and on.		Obviously if you're a fan of this band you should know what to expect. New listeners who haven't owned one of Death Cab's CD's before should be warned, however. Personally, I'm getting tired of bands creating very misleading 1st singles that sound nothing like the rest of the CD...it's CD's like Narrow Stairs that explain why so many people today illegally download music.
1,N'Sync are pure examples of what music shouldn't be. They are a typical manufactured boy band who, unlike their album title have "many strings attached". They have no musical independence. The don't write their  own songs, they are told what to sing, how to dance (if you can call that  dancing), what to wear and what to say to the media. They are in no sense  of the  word musicians. Their voices are all synthesised and most  importantly, the actual songs are abysmal. I am not suprised that they've  sold millions in only a month..its a sad testament to the commercial nature  of the music industry. All i can say to N'Sync is: "bye bye bye".
1,I bought this for CopaCabana,,,the 2005 Mix is decent....paid 2 cents for it,,wouldn't pay more than that,,,
1,As many cd's that I have ordered this is the only one that does not play. All it says is cd error, and because of that I will have to return it and would love to get another Rare Earth cd back.
1,It shouldn't have ended this way. Jeff Lynne always was an unashamed Beatlemaniac, so why didn't he finish the ELO project with an album people could look back on with warmth like "Abbey Road" (Note to Beatle  stalkers - I *know* "Let It Be" was released *after* "Abbey  Rd." but the latter was recorded last, ok?), instead of the frequently  dismal "Balance Of Power" ? One look at the tragically dated  "80's-hip-graphics" sleeve reveals the album's contents without  listening to a note : Jeff has done his old trick again, and followed  fashion by mutating his sound into ghastly 80's synth-rock ... as a  perceptive reviewer further down points out : er, where's the orchestra  gone ? By 1986, the game was clearly up for the once mighty ELO and the  balance of power (hardee-ha-ha) had shifted away from them. Reduced to a  mere three members (check out the hilarious sleeve photo of Jeff, Bev Bevan  and Richard Tandy in their "Crockett & Tubbs" suits !) the  band sound like they are going through the motions for the vast majority of  this album. It is hard to believe that the producer, Mack, had worked on  some of their more grandiose earlier efforts. The production is so thin on  some tracks that you could almost think you were listening to a demo of an  album, not a finished product. The whole CD sounds rushed and tired, as if  they couldn't be really bothered with the whole thing anymore ... perhaps  it would have been better if this album had never seen the light of day and  ELO had ended with the criminally underated, and almost forgotten  "Secret Messages" album three years previously. Instead, we get  treated to ten tracks of sequencers and drum machines plodding out fairly  standard then-new Lynne compostions plus a leftover from the truncated  "Secert Messages" (it was originally supposed to be a double  album) ... I have given this album two stars because some of the songs *do*  show promise, "Without Someone" for example, but have been let  down so badly by poor production, that they fail to shine. Only the very  beginning of the minor hit "Calling America" (complete with dumb,  dumb lyrics) echos the glory days of ELO ... a real wasted opportunity. For  sadists or completists only, I'm afraid.
1,Take the lamest Nine Inch Nails album and splice it with the best Linkin Park album,(or I guess any Linkin Park album will do since they all sound the same) and what do you have? Korn. Enough of these substanceless, mainstream, sell-out high school rock bands like Korn, Linkin Biscuit and Hootie Blew my Fish already! Bands like Razed in Black, Psychopomps, and Biopsy all make Korn look like N'Sync singing a Shania Twain song.
1,This was an album for only their core fanbase to like--the kids who were too young to even want to pay attention to content.  Absolutely horrible album.  Their first one was the only good album that they have put together.  They have shown maturity on this album but didn't show with their skills.		Notable Tracks:		Da Bomb		Alright (Extended Version)
1,Lucky to give 1 star...Many Classic Rock bands circa 70s can perform, live , with passion and devotion to their music. This IS NOT one of them.	How much longer will they continue to shamelessly release the same boring renditions of the same stuff....OVER and OVEr and OVer and Over.	Instead of wasting your money, go see a Yes cover band. That is sorrily what they have become.
1,Virtual Insanity was the jam here.cosmic girl was cool but this disc is downhill after that. Jamiroquai has moments here&there with the Stevie Wonder Influences but it doesn't hold up.
1,The album cover is damaged
1,How did this get 4.5 stars? I have every record that Dave have ever been on. He's one of my favorite guitar players and a huge influence on my own playing. This record is just awful, worse than "On an Island." Sadly, Gilmour only sounds good within the chemistry of Floyd and the words and music of Roger Waters.
1,I am not in particular a Radiohead fan. I bought this album largely because of my friends' glowing recommendations. So, I'd never before heard any of the songs on here, so I was unsure what to expect, but sure it would be good. Well...  My first impression of the album was less than auspicious. I couldn't understand the vocals, none of the songs seemed good, not to mention they all seemed to blend together. I couldn't tell where one ended and the next began. But, that was okay. That was my usual reaction upon hearing a CD for the first time. Some of my favorite artists, I've hated upon first hearing them. So I figured I'd wait a day or so, then listen to the CD again. Well, I listened to it again...same problems. Unintelligible vocals, repetetive songs, etc... After a few more times listening to it, I was ready to shoot the CD player to make the music go away. While I understand that Radiohead is considered progressive or experimental rock, that is no excuse for "music" such as this. Those groups survive only as long as their music is both experimental and GOOD.  Some have said that Kid A is only the tip of the iceberg, they're going to bring about a new wave of music. Please...no. This was one heck of an effort by Radiohead, but it didn't come off quite right. I'm sure their next effort will be better.
1,How can you people say that ac/dc is good?How can you say they are legends?No,they aren't,they suck. Every single ac/dc song has the same sound to it. The difference between all their songs?The lyrics. Thats it,just the lyrics. Hells Bells sounds strangely familiar to Back in Black and wait! Haven;t I already heard you shook me all night long???I thought that was the first track on this cd!!!If no one sang on this cd I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between all the songs.ac/dc +overrated=sucky cd
1,It's sad when such a mediocre work comes out of a bank of talent and richness that was the Beatles and McCartney's solo career.  Paul, it's time to relax and retire before you damage the good work you did in the past by mocking it with this watered down 'new' material based on what's now a formula.	Yah, I know, we'd all like more of the nourishing stuff he used to create...but this is tripe
1,I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with this album. Several places "Triangle" has been referred to as a classic album and as the best album by the band. It does feature several fine strings-arrangements by Van Dyke Park, but the overall lack of real good songs, makes the album a pretty dull experience.		Actually the first song that really stirred my attention was Randy Newman's "My Old Kentucky Home" and by the end of that song, the album was over. A few more songs like "Magic Hollow" and and the title track lift themselves above average, but not enough to make the album really interesting.
1,Obviously the producers have it figured that they can put in any music that touches on the John Williams theme from the first three movies and it will pass muster and save them money. How sad for us the listeners. This album, as the one before it, show that the way to keep the series with some consistency that also holds them together is to keep the same composer which is not happening any more. All the star wars movies; most of the james bond films; the rocky films; back to the future films; the first two batman films; rambo movies; first few die hard movies, all got this key thing and their sequels were terrifically enhanced. Williams did all three Indiana Jones movies and each was a better soundtrack than the one before; he did the first two Superman films and his score was used in the third too. The fourth Superman movie fell off the wagon and died in the box office. The fifth, Superman Returns, used some unknown composer for most of the score and it was lousy and forgettable.	This new Harry Potter film is great but the soundtrack is a waste almost entirely and won't hold up by itself the way Potters 1-3 all do/did. Save your money on this one and tell the producers by not buying it that the consumers are not so easily conned and maybe they will pay Williams to do the next movie.
1,Can't be heard because it's damaged on the best tracks.	We don't buy records to end up having this feeling.
1,OK, better start scrolling down to the "unhelpful" link if you are a die-hard Snow Patrol fan.  But I do feel the need to be contrarian here.		I got into these guys after hearing "Chasing Cars" and picking up the Eyes Open cd.  That cd has an edge to it, and some passion, which is solely lacking from A Hundred Million Suns.  So I was actually looking forward to listening to this one.  Unfortunately, it's a disappointment.		Take "Take Back the City" for example.  I fully agree with the previous reviewer who stated this has a shelf life of about a month, max.  Sorry, when the best you can do in a chorus is "woah woah woah" then you know you've had creative problems.  And this is supposed to the "hit song" off this album?  It's actually one of the worst songs I've ever heard from Snow Patrol.		So many of these songs are plodding, as well, or repetitious.  Either no inflection in the singer's voice, or the same guitar loop over and over.		The band's label is marketing this as their big breakthrough to stardom, but alas, they didn't do it.  I predict that longstanding fans of the group will enjoy this album for the most part, but it certainly won't win over any new converts.
1,Let's face it. She has no talent, she can not sing (How else could you explain when she says 'Me' it sounds 'Mai'?), she can dance a bit but that's because of how many dance lessons she takes, unless she's stupid that she can't get it straight. Musically she's terrible (Song titled 'Not a girl, not yet a woman'? Geez!) altho she doesn't write her own tunes or atleast most of them, which would of been worst,  so how come she sells that much? Simple: Read my topic title!		Why do you think there's artists (if you can call them that) try to wear less clothe and more make up on each video? Let alone talk about sex or insinuate it by her body movement? That's all she can do and that is why she will still sell out shows aswell with merchandise. Do you really think she gets aired because shes talented? Kids love her music, just like they digged Barney's couple of years ago but still not to actually consider her a diva.		Another thing that really grabbed my attention was that after releasing 4 albums she decided to make a greatest hits. Most bands release their greatest work after 5 or more albums, succesfull or not, or if they retire soon they will release a 'best of'. Spears releasing this clearly shows how she wants to keep selling, and people are dumb enough to buy it. Has she ran out of ideas? Is she too pregnant? My answer is, her record company makes her decisions. After all she's just another puppet, making big bucks.		I will say one thing which is sure, Brintey Spears got beauty. She will be better off modeling, not acting (God forbid, no more) but really, leave the music industry. It's not doin any good, maybe for now since she's selling but in 10 years of time she will go down the drain and prolly be the prank of the joke, like most teeny poppers did after their short but millionare musical career.
1,The title of this CD should have been "David Crosby meets Big Mama Thornton".	The "gruff" vocal techinque (for lack of a better term) that David Crosby employs in this recording completely ruins what could have been some fine live interpretations of some of his greatest music.	For those of you who love the sweetness and subtlety of David Crosby's voice, you're not going to find it here. I was deeply disappointed upon listening to this recording.	Crosby's work on his 1971 masterpiece "If I Could Only Remember My Name" will forever remain the pinnacle of his solo output, much like Ian McDonald & Michael Giles' "McDonald & Giles" and Chris Squire's "Fish Out Of Water".	It is very difficult, if not impossible, to surpass perfection. And "If I Could Only Remember My Name" was exactly that - perfection.
1,What's up wit "Vol. 3".  "Vol. 2" was OK but I love "Vol. 1", "The Dynasty", and "Reasonable Doubt" but this record was below Jay-Z's level.  He's a great rapper but this was definately not a great album.	The "Hova Song" intro was good and I liked "So Ghetto" and "Do It Again" but "Dope Man" was just a filler track.  I like "Things That You Do" with Mariah Carey but "It's Hot", "Snoopy Track", "S. Carter", "Pop 4 Roc", and "Watch Me" were more filler tracks.  "Big Pimpin" with UGK was great and so was "There's Been A Murder" but "Come And Get Me", "Nymp", and the "Hova Song" outro were more fillers.  The bonus tracks "Anything" and "Jigga My Nigga" were great though.	I would buy the other Jay-Z albums but leave "Vol. 3" alone.
1,Coming after his career rejuvenation trioligy, expectatons were high. Unfortunately, the lyrics, music and tonal quality are fall short of Dylan's Olympian standards. Dylan should fire himself (there's something going on here and you don't know what it is, do you Mr. Frost?) as producer.
1,Sanitised, bland, repetitive - you know the drill.		I wrote this for _Shel "chelie1"_ Don't worry, I know the mainstream music is full of vulgarities and gangsta rappers and poor music. For all you people out there, listen up - you may learn a thing or two. I, after all, have treaded on this path once before		Albums you should experience at least once -		1 Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon		2 Pain of Salvation - Remedy Lane (Don't be scared by the band name, Pain of Salvation are one of the best bands around creatively, musically and philosophically, if not the best)		3 Meshuggah - I (For those of you who have heavier tastes)		4 Tangerine Dream - Zeit		5 Dream Theater - Images & Words		Just a few bands for you to ponder over.		Also, listen to a few Amazon reviewers who have truly been around the block (there's absolutely no shame in standing on the shoulders of giants).		Lord Chimp		http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADJXL0W0RJ7VV/ref=cm_cr_auth/102-9369466-2328103		Wheelchair Assassin		http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0/ref=cm_cr_auth/102-9369466-2328103		are just two of the many people I respect for their taste in music
1,I had this when it first came out on LP so I decided to get it as a 5.1 surround version. Nowhere in the ad says its PAL region 2. Don't buy this version if your player is REGION 1.
1,Queensryche's Dedicated to Chaos is not a record for those seeking a return to the band's signature guitar-driven hard rock and heavy metal roots. Frontman Geoff Tate has the album's music writers -- mostly non-band members Kelly Gray, Randy Gane and Jason Slater -- create a slate of music that has more in common with the pop genre.		And while poppier music can be good if executed well, it isn't on this album. The lyrics on Dedicated to Chaos are full of tired cliches and metaphors mostly about Geoff's love interests and commentary on issues that make him sound like a grumpy old man. Frankly, in this reviewer's opinion, the lyrics are likely the worst to have ever made it onto a record with the Queensryche name.		Musically, Dedicated to Chaos does have its moments, there are bits and pieces of music that Queensryche fans would appreciate here. "At the Edge" has some good qualities as does "Big Noize" (the 1980s teenager spelling aside) and "The Lie." In addition, the drumming of Scott Rockenfield is top notch, likely his most inspired drumming performance since 1994's Promised Land. Tate also breaks out his sax in a few spots, which is always a treat for QR fans that enjoy that.		What's shocking, however, is the lack of guitar-driven music. Most of Dedicated to Chaos is focused on the rhythm section and keyboards. And while it's always good to mix things up now and then, when your musical style and sound are predicated on a writing style of guitar-driven songs, the change to a rhythm-oriented pop sound is noticeably jarring and could lead to many fans jumping ship.		If you're a fan of Geoff Tate's 2002 solo album, and Queensryche's Q2k (1999) and Hear in the Now Frontier (1997), you'll get some enjoyment out of Dedicated to Chaos. The album is essentially a pop-based hybrid of those three records, but based more around the rhythm section than the guitar.		But if you're wanting something akin to the heavy and aggressive rock roots of Queensryche, or even the dark progressive undertones and lyrics of 1994's Promised Land and 2009's American Soldier, you won't find it here.
1,First off I am a huge Tori fan, seen her live ,got all her stuff.. This Cd lacks all the catch you off guard screaming, breathing and squeaky voice stuff that I love.. Looks like Sony exec's are trying to make her into something more predicitable and tame.. I only like a couple on this one, boring and uneventful,on a positive note ,like all her stuff it's a well recorded Quaility CD... It must be the work of Aliens .....Ok who are you ? and what did you do with the real Tori?.. Chris
1,The only thing I wanted to hear on here was the Bat Out Of Hell album songs which are not well done at all on this set.  I'm astonished that reviews claim this to be Meat Loaf at his best when it clearly is far from it to anyone without talent deafness.  If you watch the BOH/BOH II tours and even the welcome to the neighbour tours meat is anything but on top of his game here.  His voice shines in very few places on bats live and is mostly terrible.  Not a good live performance.
1,At the risk of getting NO helpful votes, let me give you my background. I am a Casting Crowns fan. Their first album is what got me into Contemporary Christian Music. Every song on that album was quite strong and most were very challenging to get up and do something for God. Their remaining releases, in my opinion, started to decrease in quality. About the time Until The Whole World Hears came around, I started to lose interest. While there wasn't inherently something wrong with what they were singing about, the presentation and passion seemed gone. It was like almost anyone could sing these songs.		THRIVE is no different. The music seems to be meandering in the same kind of sound with the last three releases. While the lyrics are somewhat bland and clichd, they do talk about our Savior and how he impacts our lives. But it doesn't lead to a catchy melody nor does it attempt to pull you in. Megan Garrett has a pretty voice but when she attempts to layer a song, it sounds more like interjections and over singing Mark Hall and it becomes annoying. Turn Melodee DeVevo loose on the fiddle. Crank up the guitars a little more often. Something needs to jazz their albums up.		This review wasn't intended to trash the group but to perhaps challenge them to shake it up some. What they sing about is important and it will undeniably touch many people. And perhaps this is their comfort zone and target audience. And I own all their CD's, a few DVD's and I will be on the front row to see them in concert. But since waiting for Casting Crowns latest release, I've been listening to groups like All Son's and Daughters, Ghost Ship, Rend Collective Experiment, Crowder, Bethel Music and Jesus Culture. Putting on THRIVE seems like a step in the wrong direction.
1,walking around the Thousand Oaks Mall last night looking to be recognized. You kids are funny...  Aaron, i'll never forget when i was working at your high school and you were a 16 year old vegan punker screaming in Insurgence. I'm not really into this stuff you're doing but best of luck to you..
1,Exactly, you only hear what you want from this CD only 2 songs You say and I do her 2 hottest singles from the 90's that's it the rest of it it's not that WOOW!!! That we say but is OK
1,It must get boring singing standards, even when you've built a career doing so.  Krall's attempt to do something different here is admirable in theory but tedious in execution.  When I want to hear Diana Krall I'll play something else from her numerous CD's but this one will be filed with "The Girl In The Other Room" and won't likely be played again. Hopefully this is simply a diversion and not a harbinger of the rest of her career.
1,As it is universally recognized this one was done by the BOC when they were pretty tired of all of this - music, touring, industry, life, necessity to get up in the morning etc. And it shows! Basically, "Take Me Away" and "Shooting Shark" are indeed the two worthy tracks here... "Feel The Thunder" is somewhat decent but derivative. But again, as I emphasized in some other BOC reviews here, this is such an uneven record... not surprising with these guys being in the twelfth year of their psychedelic-metal trip. What absolutely kills me here is the fact that this is the studio album directly following the "Fire of Unknown Origin", the absolute highlight of their career. It seems as if they put all the good stuff into FOUO and were left only with some leftover junk which failed to develop into anything decent in two years. Also with Albert Bouchard leaving the band they decided to change producer and the result is so mediocre and unoriginal that I certainly am not going to recommend buying this CD unless again you are a completist at heart.. or simply have too much money in your pocket. Send me a couple of Franklins then, would ya buddy?
1,I saw the video for this song, and hated it. Paris Hilton is a horrible actress, rich as hell, and now she has a singing ckarrer? Gimme a break. Plus, what's with all the remixes? Stupid!		Really, the song's worst crime is that it's a RIPOFF- It rips off a lot of Bob Marley's songs, and yet, Paris had to "sing" over her voice 5 times for true effect.		Horrible, don't buy.
1,This product I could not find uses of for the need.
1,Mediocre songs, sung with a whining voice, full of self-pity, mediocre guitar work. A waste of money.
1,Well, I don't know what else the other reviewers listen to, maybe I should check out their profiles to see where they are coming from. But I am certainly not on board with them when it comes to Get On Board.	I first became aware of Eric Bibb several years back through a John Mayall cover of one of his songs. Wanting to hear the original, I bought the Bibb album on which it was featured. That CD was good enough to make me want to hear more and I have acquired several others but Get On Board sadly is the least of them.	Get On Board starts promisingly enough with a stirringly spiritual Spirit I Am. That is followed by the fine bluesy Promised Land but then it is all downhill from there. Mellow and folksy it is, but the songwriting is often jivey, corny, hackneyed, and on Conversation, wince-inducing. My least favorites are If Our Hearts Ain't In It, Pockets, the aforementioned Conversation, God's Kingdom, and Stayed On Freedom.	After the positive press reviews and all the hosannahs sung highly here of Get On Board, I was hoping for much better. I guess Eric can only go where his muse leads him, but I'm jumping off his train right here.		Postscript: I just did as I suggested I should have done in the first sentence and find that I am not even on the same musical planet with any of them. If you are primarily a music person, check what they have reviewed against what I've reviewed before you make your decision on whether or not to buy.
1,Didn't catch this was a tribute band and not the actual Beatles
1,How anyone can blather on about MMM being "art" or "musical" is borderline perverse. Lou wasn't even in the room when the thing was recorded ! I wonder what else is considered worthy of 5 stars ...The Shaggs ? The Chipmunks ?
1,In this album Helloween tried something new, but without a clear direction the album turned out to be a loser, confusing his hard-core fans and gaining almost none new ones.
1,Sad...this is obviously EC's swan song CD and on to retirement ...? Save your money...wish I had !
1,i really can't believe i bought this album after hearing the catchy but rubbish single "in the shadow" with it's catchy immature chorus their will be teenyboppers round the world thinking their goths and dark just because their singing a chorus about being in the shadows...there was one song i like from this album but i gave it to a charity shop so i can't remember anymore and don't care		this band is good if you like sweet innocent pop music		but if you want real gothic music buy the cult, NIN, midnight oil, etc...		the rasmus are posers for a world who has no taste
1,I will always enjoy Kanye for his artistry, but unfortunately this album just falls short. The songs have no replay value and his beats & lyricism are becoming predictable. Hopefully his fourth release will be much more enjoyable.
1,I usually like Jackson but find it really offensive that an individual whose personal relationships with women have resulted in violence has the audacity to protest violence on the international scene. IF you can't get along with the one you love,don't tell us how to get along. Maybe you should listen to the words of another insightful songwriter who said "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE" Unless "In the Shape of a Heart " is his admission of his own faults!!!!!!!!!
1,Was supposed to be "greatest hits" but the songs I wanted were not on this.  Quite disappointed.
1,Hazy, scratchy, bizarre, with vocals nestled in there somewhere. Difficult to completely appreciate as melody and theme seem to be missing. I suppose this is what you discover by mistake when, say, looking up albums by Ringo Starr and you get misdirected.
1,After seeing all the reviews here and then listening to this CD vs. the Beeb Birtles, Gleen Shoorock, Graham Goble CD & Live DVD "Full Circle"......THIS BAND IS IMPOSTERS, A COVER BAND, and NOT THE ORIGINAL LITTLE RIVER BAND at all!!  This is my opinion on the matter.  It'd be like saying there is a new Beatles Recording because Rigno Starr perfomed on it, and Ringo went and called his fake new band The Bealtes. And actually, another reviewer is 100% correct. This band contains NO ORIGINAL LRB memebrs from the heyday of all their hits.  I think it is a shame that this cover band of imposters gets away legally somehow with keeping the name of the band when there is no original members in this line up.  Especially because they kept the other original Little River Band memebers (Birtles, Shoorock & Goble) from touring and basically dissed all the orginal LRB fans.  This band might be ok musically, but no where near as talented as the original members that played on the REAL Little RIver Band Live recording "Backsatge Pass" or the 2003 Birtles, Shoorock & Goble's "FUll Circle" CD & DVD. Ths fake cover band couldn't dream of performing live the orignal band's song "Light Of Day".
1,There is a Special Place in Our Heart's for Oldies and Possibly this Discovered Series. However, If No Artist is Connected to These Songs, Its Like Bread W/O Butter, Potatoes W/O Gravy, Coffee W/O. a Cup, Tea W/O the Bag, Cars W/O Wheels, Ice Cream W/O the Cone, A Shower W/O Water, & MP3s W/O Anything. Get The Point? Its the Un-Finished Symphony.......(All Worth-Less!)	Many of these Songs Were Recorded By More Than One Artist! I For One, Will Not Buy a Cd Without The Artist Listed to the Song!	If you Want to sell this Product, Give the Buyer the Full Description, Or Just Leave it On The Shelf! I Do Not Want to Waste My Time Trying to Guess, If The Song Titles You List, Are by The Artists I Remember, Sorry!		No Sale On This One!
1,Ac/Dc had released a great CD called 'Fly On The Wall' filled with memorable sing along hits and some darn fine videos,the follow-up 'Blow Up Your Video' had a couple real strong songs and the rest filler...this was followed by the  huge comeback release 'The Razors Edge' which showed that this band was still capable of great things and then came this one,'Ballbreaker'		I bought this the week it came out and was very encouraged by the first single 'Hard As A Rock' which rocks as hard as any Ac/Dc song,it was fantastic,the next song 'Cover You In Oil' was absolutely everything an Ac/Dc song should be,great catchy melody,great Angus solo,Brian's screaming vocals,extremely sexually charged lyrics and best of all a beat that would make any woman in a ten mile radius want to get up and shake what she's got on the dance floor (the hallmark of any great Ac/Dc song)		but what happens after that? Did they lose steam or just not care? 'The Furor' is boring and seems very repetitive,'Boogie Man' has some cool lyrics and atmosphere but it feels like we've heard it before,'Burnin' Alive','Hail Caesar','Love Bomb','Caught With Your Pants Down' and 'Ballbreaker' almost leave me yawning,the music is so repetitive,the songs lack the sing a long charm of most of their past albums,and in fact the majority of this release sound as if it was songs from 'Blow Up Your Video' I will say this,'The Honey Roll' and 'Whiskey On The Rocks' are great songs that have the same feel as songs from their breakthrough 'Back In Black' but it's too little too late to save this album,I will cut them some slack because it's very hard to be writing new music since the mid 70's with the same feel and the same style,and sure,it's bound to get a little repetitive but I think this one is one of their worst		The Upside - 'Cover You In Oil' alone is worth buying this CD,'Whiskey On The Rocks','Hard As A Rock' and 'The Honey Roll' are all great classic Ac/Dc tunes...Angus' solos are still top notch throughout,Brian Johnson can still scream right up there with anyone,and the rhythm section is as tight as can be...the production is very good,much warmer then 'The Razors Edge'		The Downside - Weighed down by far too much filler material,I find myself grabbing the CD cover several times to see when it'll be over,the songs all kind of melt into one another (not a good thing) to the point where you wonder where one ends and another begins		The Bottom Line - All true Ac/Dc fans should buy this,there are enough great songs on here to make it worth your time,but if you are not a huge fan I would pass this one by,definitely not a CD to play for someone new to the band,if you are new to Ac/Dc I would recommend starting with 'Back In Black' 'Highway To Hell' and Dirty Deeds,then move on to the rest of the catalog...it's not a horrible CD but it's certainly not nearly their best...Donutman says so!!!
1,If you want to "witness" the assassination of Laura's melody, just get this CD. Hawkins had a lot of brawn, but very little brain. Jazz musicians are supposed to improvise but not like that.
1,Barely a pulse from either Lani or Herb. Even the well known songs come off as funeral dirges. Drags so much, it's depressing.
1,Peter is a gifted musician. However, he also is "gifted" with long distance mind reading. To become a fan of his is to open yourself up to the possibility of him reading your thoughts and spying on you in the spirit as he is one of the most spiritual people on the planet and is very sensitive. I experienced this and it was one of the most horrible things I've ever experienced in all my born-again-christian days. He was watching me 24/7 and he let me know it. I had a difficult time getting rid of him. It was quite unpleasant and made me wish I'd never heard his music. I used to be a huge fan. He started reading my thoughts after I began following him on Twitter. I quit his Twitter as soon as I realized that he was in my spiritual space but quitting his Twitter did not help the problem.  I felt like a mangled bug trapped in a spider's web.  All this evidentally had to do with a sin committed pertaining to him-a sin that I wasn't even aware I had committed!!  Now, anytime I have any thought about the Newsboys, even if it's a nice thought, Pete hears the thought and comes through the spirit into my face and starts tormenting me.  I had a nice thought about Pete's wife today and there he was in the spirit making comments and it was making me mad.  Be careful!  I care about his fans and I'm sharing this so it doesn't happen to anyone else.  I haven't even shared everything that was so horrible here that has happened but these are the basics.
1,Can't stand her voice or music.
1,Four songs from "American Life" get make-overs here.  While they might be called radical, I wouldn't call them improvements, for different reasons.  "American Life" is a bad song lyrically and stylistically - remixing it won't hide that.  "Hollywood" isn't much better.  "Love Profusion," on the other hand, is a well-crafted song in its original laid-back, acoustic-rock-dance incarnation.  The edgier rock treatment here neither detracts nor adds - it just provides another take on it, one worth a spin (in fact, I think if L. P. had been the first single, the album might have seen greater success).  The rest is collector fare, nothing hit-worthy.  Even her recap of "Into The Groove" ("Into The Hollywood Groove") is a cheap re-do, thanks to a lazy dubbing of the original chorus with too much effects processing.
1,When I first heard "Heartless" on the radio, I had high hopes for Kanye's new album. I love it when artists experiment (and this is definitely an experimental album); Electric Circus and The New Danger were great albums in my opinion, even though they performed poorly commercially. Unfortunately, Mr. West seems to have missed his mark.		808s opens with "Say You Will", which was unfortunate because I'd already heard "Heartless", and finding out that there were two songs on the album that sounded eerily similar was disheartening. Especially considering that one of Kanye's greatest virtues was that, prior to this album, every track had a distinct, original sound with special something that let you know who produced that song. Not that either of these are especially bad songs, but as the album progresses and one boring, distortion filled sing-along flows into the next, the concept quickly looses its originality, and the listener looses interest.		The bright side? Lil Wayne on "See you in my Nightmares". I've never liked Lil Wayne's music; the term "nauseating" comes to mind. But he really changed my opinion of him as an artist with this track. Excellent production, one of a kind sound, and poignant lyrics easily make this the best song on the album, and one of Kanye's overall best as well. Too bad this wasn't there weren't more like this one, 808s could have actually been enjoyable.		Another reviewer called this album Emo-Pop, and after 5 listens, I have to say that I agree. Not sure if I've ever heard a grown man whine this much, let alone in public. I'd like to think that maybe he's humbling himself as an exercise in self-discovery, but it actually feels as though he's reached a whole new level of arrogance/insecurity. Kanye, come on man, do you expect us to actually like this album? How insulting.		Overall, I wouldn't call any of the songs bad, just mostly mundane and droll. This could be a tough one for KW to recover from, maybe even tougher than Linkin Park recovering from the Minutes to Midnight debacle. Stranger things have happened though, and I'll buy his next album despite this one. I think I'll make a bet with myself that I'll hate it, so that no matter whether it's love or hate, I win!		My advice? Just buy the "See you in my Nightmares" single, and forget the rest of the album. At least we've got the new Common and Mos Def albums to look forward to. And don't forget to give Q-Tip's new release a listen as well, especially for all the Tribe fans out there!
1,Not one of the best collections of her material, really only purchased to add to my collection.
1,I have been a fan of surrealistic Marillion music for more than 20 years. I especially enjoyed the early releases. However it puzzles me why any fan would rate this compilation "Misplaced Childhood" by more than one star, if any. I purchased it without looking at its track titles, only to discover repeated tracks in a two-disc, pricey CD set. Out of 20 songs in the set, 15 are repeatitions, two of them are recorded three times!!! This is  unacceptable and I would say, shows lack of respect for fans who buy the CDs.		Yes I love Marillion music, but I'd rather use my stereo player to replay my favorite tracks as many times as I want. The repeated tracks in this CD set are slightly different but this is not a good justification and there is no value for money here, especially at a price of $19.99 plus shipping. I do not recommend this CD set. You're better off buying the original releases, or pay $0.99 to download each individual song.
1,Unlistenable after 2 or 3 tries. This album came with incredibly high praise from many sources, but I don't agree at all. Every track ranges from mildly to extremely pretentious and cutesy, loaded with oh-so-ironic hipster pseudo-nostalgia.
1,The variety of songs on the CD sounded great.  However, when the first CD was received, the songs listed on the CD cover list were NOT those on the CD.  There were two (2) differences.  Didn't care for the other songs and confusion between the CD and listing.
1,Okay I did not really pay attention to what I was buying. I was looking for a greatest hits collection of Donna Summer so I saw all the hits listed on the tracks and thus bought it. It is all remixes. Personally these songs were so good why remix them. I was very disappointed with a lot of them. They try to update the music but in my opinion they took away a lot of the soul of the music.
1,America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums.
1,With The Clash and London Calling these musicians were on top of the Empire State Building, but with this album they fell all the way to the sidewalk below.
1,can i rate any lower?  this band is horrible.  they try to sound cool but the sound sucks.  spiders voice is pathetic.  i cannot believe he is actually related to the amazing rob zombie.  id rather listen to limp bizkit.  and that is saying a lot about this band.  don't even bother.
1,Not a quality product. Didn't play well and was less than described.
1,These discs have spots where they stop playing. I'm disappointed. I am hoping, have not tried it yet, that there is a downloadable version that isn't missing or skipping as the discs do.
1,I am an old Midge Ure era Ultravox fan and was excited to get this cd. Pretty dull. If you need an 80's new wave band fix, try the Fixx's "Beautiful Friction". Friction= 4.5 stars out of 5. Brilliant= 2.5 out of 5.		Dave S
1,I really wanted this to be good. But I was disappointed again by the Wu. There are three problems with this album: the beats, the lyrics and the vocal delivery. In other words, there's not much I can praise about it. The  beats are mostly repetitive samples from old soul tunes. The soundscapes  are at their best dull, and at worst irritating. The lyrics are too  esoteric - Ghostface Killah's jargon is often unpenetrable. The lyrical  content becomes unintelligible and is reduced to background noise - which  is great if you're looking for wallpaper music. The vocal delivery is flat  and monotone - there are no interesting changes in rythmn, tone or accent.  Very little to please me here. As a fan of the Wu's early work, I'm  disappointed again.
1,Another great band gone over the hill.	What possessed them to do something like this?	The whole thing is in French, PLEASE!	The female vocals are nothing but annoying.	Where is the METAL?	Save your money and hope they come to their senses.
1,alrite... enimen.. u r a white boy from a trailor park... u sing about crap... u may b musically talented but u shud stop making some damn rap crap homie!!! please, do urself a favor
1,I want to be clear up front: the 2-star review is not for the album's contents (we'll get to that), it's for a manufacturing issue with the 2015 CD format. I regret that this will effect the aggregate rating for the album but there is not a very good way to separate the two (product and album contents) and I feel it's justified. We're not professional critics here, either, so I take some solace that these customer reviews reflect real life first-hand experiences, and all that contributes to them. No one's going to say, "well, it's only a 3.5 on Amazon!"		Here's the issue: originally, The Hill was one long 35-minute track made up of many songs that flow together and/or slam right into one another. Merge, a label I dearly love, erred on the side of giving fans too much when they elected to divide the CD's songs into discreet tracks.		The result is that in many playback situations there is a noticeable audio gap that profoundly mars the listening experience. In my mom's Pacifica, in my own car's player, in my Philips home CD player, in our DVD player, and in iTunes the album's continuity is repeatedly interrupted. I think having it be one long track was an aesthetic decision on Buckner's part. Merge no doubt had the listener's convenience in mind when they indexed the tracks instead, but something happened either in the mastering or manufacturing that resulted in the audible gaps.		The reissued CD I bought was taken back as defective by the small bookstore I bought it from. I sent Merge a couple e-mails over the last month to let them know of the issue, but haven't heard a reply as of publishing this review. In the interim, I tracked down a copy of the original 2000 CD on Overcoat Records. Easy to find, ~$5 on alibris or secondspin.		On the plus side: Merge did an outstanding job replicating the packaging. I know, I've held them both side by side. I have no doubt the vinyl is wonderful, and the album is a gem in Buckner's discography from a songwriting standpoint. The 4-tracked recordings and textures hail to other lo-fi masterpieces like Springsteen's Nebraska or early Guided By Voices acoustic numbers. The transitions (grrrr) are masterful and subtle in the unaltered, original form.		I hope this problem can be addressed on future pressing of the CD. I remain a devoted follower of Merge.
1,I had both of Leonard Nimoy's albums when I was a kid, and even then it was apparent that Nimoy can't carry a tune any more than he could carry William Shatner over Niagara Falls while balanced on a strand of dental floss! There are times when I wince, it's so bad. But if you're a fan, it doesn't matter how bad Nimoy is. You'd probably buy it just as a collector's item.		The CD is probably just mastered from the vinyl press. That shouldn't affect the quality (and I use the term loosely), though. Buying it would be...highly illogical.
1,What am I missing? I gave it 4 solid listens in different moods (none angry) just spread it over a span of a week... I personally feel he is narrating the entire album, I get it- nothing like he's displayed before and "different" direction is usually accept. However,I'll take 'EMDM' over this which at least displayed his classic demeanor in the voice and effort. I tried, and very rarely do I dislike any album- I have a huge collection but this one tanked!		I've never ranked any album on Amazon or personally on a rating of 1 star aka poor.		And for some of you, I'm 31 years old, seen almost every rock band (metal,death,grunge,modern, etc) from A to Z... and own a ridiculous amount of albums i.e. 500 plus.		I'm still open-minded to giving it another spin but I don't see it happening which may or may not be my loss. Kudos to ones who really enjoy it.
1,As a reviewer, I've gotten used harsh criticism. When you dish it out, you've gotta be prepared to take it. As someone who's kicked the legacies of hip-hop's darling martyr, 2Pac, to the curb quite a few times, I've gotten used to internet death threats and 'u dun no hipop' claims, so whatever negative comments and reviews I get from this album will do little to change my mind; save the hating ahead of time, as a rating is my opinion and nothing more.		My opinion is that this album is very poor. It's come to my attention that in hip-hop circles, KRS-1 can do no wrong because of his legacy alone. This is sad, and unfortunate, as the people who praise KRS on helping build the foundation for hip-hop alone are as bad as the people who think Lil' Wayne's the best rapper alive, and do the Pop, Lock, and Drop It dance. I can understand that not every Kris fan is like this; but at the same time, it's rather hard to believe that any 15 year old can throw on a Kris album and vibe along to it for the music alone.		It's also hard for me to believe that anyone is feeling this release as much as they say. KRS-1 has become such a disgruntled, conceited old dude that his lyrics have disminished to nothing more than "I am the human embodiment of hip-hop." Nearly every track follows this "Hip-Hop IS KRS-1" formula, and the few tracks that don't still try to put over KRS' status as a "God emcee." Now, I admit, I maybe biased against KRS; I've never really felt him. When I think of God emcees, I think of Rakim, Kane, G. Rap, Jigga, Andre 3000, and Ghostface; not some dude with an ego trip longer than Weezy's dreads and the paper Birdman so frequently measures.		Marley Marl's production is obviously dated; it'd sound much better in the 90s, or the 80s. Now, don't get me, wrong, I loved golden-era rap as much as the next dude; when it actually came FROM the golden-era. Here in 2007, this album simply doesn't click, and it would've been seen as inferior even in the golden-era, simply due to its unauthentic feel. Instead of bring the old school to the new, it feels like Marley is trying way to hard to recreate the old.		Nothing on this album is really all that original; I know the same can be said about 99% of hip-hop releases mainstream AND underground, but people are praising this album for creativity when it's not much more than what other dudes have been saying for the last decade. Over 30? 30's The New 20 without the hot Dre beat, or Jigga's flawless flow. Kill A Rapper? Just an extended idea of what comedians and rappers have been saying since 2Pac and B.I.G. were shot up in the third quarter of the 90's.		I'm not saying Kris sucks; I'm not even really saying this album sucks. In fact, I rated it a two for the fact that at least KRS-1 still has decent breath control and similes at this stage in the game; however, this album is nothing more than the average underground hip-hop releases that picks on commercial music and tries to make the artist seem larger than the genre itself. KRS-1 is hip-hop; hip-hop is NOT KRS-1. Anyone who identifies the culture is hip-hop, though; you are, I am, and all the rappers most of ya'll probably diss daily are, too. Yes, Hip Hop does Live; and it'll still be breathin even when Kris is no longer with us. It had potential, but too many tracks like The Teacha's Back will have most heads pounding their head against a desk instead of nodding with the music.
1,This set seems to be missing something. Apart from the rather flat mix, and the too loud drums, the band just doesn't entirely gel, making for a few interesting variations (Brain of J., Nothing As It Seems, Last Kiss, RVM) but overall completely eclipsed by the better shows of the series (Hamburg, Poland, Milan). Why Eddie occasional flubs the lyrics this far into the tour is anybody's guess, all but completely destroying `Soon Forget,' but it could have been the band were not entirely comfortable in this tiny offshoot of Yugoslavia, as Eddie's closing comment ("Be safe. Have good lives. Goodbye.") seems to indicate they have no intention of returning any time soon. The single stand out is a big one, the rarely performed `Indifference,' and the last song of the set, haunting and ethereal, but not good enough to balance the mediocrity of the rest. This one is for completists only - and even then I doubt it will get much play in view of the competition.
1,I seen this on "That Metal Show" they recommended it and I bought it! It is very boring and dull , and lacking in hooks! Music is dull and vocals are tired!
1,This is such a disappointing album.  It sounds more like Enya's Christmas album, which is essentially a copy of all of her other songs.  They all sound they same and they are not at all Christmas like.  Do yourself a favor and save some money... if you like this artist then I'm sure you already have other songs that sound just the same.
1,Jingle jingle, jangle jangle, jingle jingle chord changes and some filtered trust fund moppy stickboy on the mic.  Take it away please, heard it all before.  Pass on this ridiculously hyped band and proceed to the source, namely the Velvets, who in their own way are also still riding the crest of a wave not so high or grand as reported.  The strumming is all Lou.  The Wedding Present, pushed along by a far more compelling singer, filtered this style with more charge, more urgency.  When that rich boy starts whining on "Barely Legal", you're looking to pull the plug.  Yes, a few catchy tunes -- and all ripped off. Female equivalent late night poseurs Elastica engaged in similar larceny.  Find some real rock n' roll somewhere else.
1,The music's too slow.
1,Been a Who fan since around the time they lost Keith. Seen them in concert 13 or so times, met them, love them. Enjoyed later albums like Face Dances and It's Hard more than most. I wish I could agree with those Who fans on here who have really turned on to this album. It hasn't happened for me yet. Yes I know they're not really The Who anymore, they're the Who's Left, and Daltrey's voice is so hoarse Springsteen's laughing at him. But I'd still think Townshend could craft something sufficiently reminiscent of their older stuff to make this album decent. Care to try again, guys?
1,The performer that greatly influenced The Beatles, a band which always did a better job on his cuts than Perkins himself did.
1,Ricky Fante has some decent range but is at best a Modern era version of Dobie Gray. He is vocally right to do a Cover of "Drift Away" but that would give Him away far to soon.alot of Hype but not much depth here. not bad vocally but nothing to get excited just yet.time will tell.
1,there just isn't anything memorable here in terms of tunesmithery.  anyone who says otherwise is just wishing.  Warpaint set up an interesting (at times) groove--the drummer is inventive enough to put me in mind of the chick in Autolux (high praise), and the bassist is doing a nice Jah Wobble imitation sometimes.  were I sitting round the old hearth having a cuppa with someone and he or she tried to defend this release as something that SHOULD have BEEN released?--well, i would ask that person to HUM or SING me something.  not possible.  kids!  there are some bands out there called the Beatles, the Kinks, the Cure, Cocteau Twins.  have a wee listen!!  ONE Cocteau Twins DEMO is worth both LPs of this lot's tripe.  just pointless.  meander, pad, pad, pad, stop.  wistful fairydust, ephemeral labyrinth of zilch.  there:  use that for a lyric, warpaint.  (all embellishment, no substantial bellicosity!!! ha!).  warPUNT!  (not a good band--what did i expect.  i bought the first one as well.  how utterly silly of me.)
1,.....the US-version of this Rihanna latest outing doesn't have the song "Cry"(UK exclusive bonus track...WTF? How about her fans in the US and also from around the globe?). Another evil marketing ploy played by the people in the music industry who are milking her success while she's on heavy rotation around the world.	 "Reloaded", "Special Extended Version", etc. It seems useless buying the first pressed cds. Because after a very SHORT while, the greedy music company will released...ooops, re-released the cd as a spanky new cd with 1 or 2 worthless track. No wonder the music industry is dying. No offence,	but i am truly tired of repackaged cd, tour-version cd and all these rubbish. Sighs.
1,This cycle of Beethoven's Symphonies is slow. Really slow. As I listened to each symphony I kept notes based on Amazon's subjective scale: 5 stars = I love it! to 1 star = I hate it!		First Symphony - baseline, it's OK, 3 stars	Second Symphony - I don't like it, 2 stars	Third Symphony - 2 stars		At this point I was getting disheartened, because other reviewers had praised these performances so highly.		Fourth Symphony - the overall concept holds together well, I like it, 4 stars	Fifth Symphony - starts OK, then bogs down in the last two movements, 2 stars	Sixth Symphony - starts stately, but loses steam in the fourth movement, 3 stars		Actually, my notes start to turn hostile here. I don't think Amazon would allow me to publish my original thoughts on the Sixth.		Seventh Symphony - sludge, 2 stars	Eighth Symphony - doesn't mess it up, 4 stars	Ninth Symphony - joyless, 2 stars		The second movement of the Ninth was particularly hard to bear. In loose terms, Klemperer falls into the now discredited trap of accelerating to half tempo instead of double time. More Moderato than Presto.		So the highpoints of the cycle for me were the Fourth and Eighth. That's a poor recommendation. I was simultaneously listening to the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/David-Zinman-Tonhalle/dp/B00000IFP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">David Zinman/Tonhalle</a>&nbsp;cycle, which sounds overcaffeinated in comparison. My preference of tempos seems to fall somewhere in the middle. I have the Josef Krips/LSO cycle on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bescol/dp/B000001RR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bescol</a>&nbsp;CDs. The digital transfer is horrible; the treble is so brittle that it sounds as if the clarinets will snap. But the underlying performances have an engaging humor and charm, and I love the reverb of the hall.		I had the sudden thought that I might like Klemperer's recordings if I could play them faster. I downloaded a demo version of the Amazing Slow Downer (which also is a Speed Upper) to give it a try. A 20% increase of speed gave the symphonies a new life; the Second showed buoyancy and delicateness; the Eroica started with a snap and stayed driven. Was this how Klemperer heard them in his head? What would Oliver Sacks have to say about brain injury and temporal perception?		A 20% increase proved too much for the Ninth Symphony, but +10% made a noticeable difference. The first movement now simmered with anticipation of unleashed potential energy. The second movement now bounced, and I was able to "fix" the acceleration to the Presto by bumping it to +35%.		Am I destroying Klemperer's artistic concept by speeding up his tempos? Not really. Classical music collections around the world remain untouched by my actions. But just as listeners (and indeed remasterers) can adjust the equalization of a recording for more pleasing sound, I have a new playback tool that increases my enjoyment of a performance. The net gain is at least 2 stars for me.
1,I doubted for a whole year whether to buy or not this "All The Hits"		double CD because I already owned other Jan & Dean CD's rating their		"The Original" one with 5 stars. My doubts were confirmed after listening		to this package. Most of the "original" versions are not the real		originals because they are different from the ones we used to listen to		on singles, EP's or LP's or on other CD compilations. Don't buy this:		besides not being original, on CD 1 there's a lot of talking nonsense		displayed on tracks 26 till 45 and on CD 2 some songs I was looking		for are not original. This "costful" CD is a true rip-off!
1,I wasn't going to do a review on Dude Ranch, because I don't like giving bad reviews. Truthfully, this CD is TERRIBLE. I have owned Dude Ranch since day one and I was very disappointed with it and it collects alot of dust.  BUT, I have since purchased Enema of the State and completely LOVED it.  They have grown as artists...definitely! I am a re-newed fan for Blink and  am completely IMPRESSED with Enema of the State, but I DON'T suggest Dude  Ranch AT ALL!
1,I don't like this album. I don't like anything that screams more than it sings. The guitar work is OKAY, the drumming sux, the bass sux, the sung vocals are sub par and the screaming is hard to understand. The production is crappy, the lyrics were slopped together in 2 weeks, the sound is total sell-out material from their first record and to top it all off, dallas has gained weight since their last video. Dont buy. PEaCe EaSy
1,Hilary Duff's latest tribute to self-absorption (AKA a "greatest hits" album with a couple of new tracks thrown in) offers one bad song after another, performed with so much electronic ambiance slapped on the vocals that it's impossible to hear what the Disney mega-star's real voice sounds like. The clich-laden lyrics seem innocuous at first, but the message is, in some ways, as scary as the most explicit gangsta rap, because MOST WANTED is nothing more than a celebration of Hilary herself.		Repetitive lyrics alternate between lovesick and preachy. Vocals are processed within an inch of their thin whiney life and mixed way above lackluster instrumental tracks. The songs are downright awful; most are remixes of past hits. The cleverest thing about MOST WANTED is its title, but it's not clever enough to carry the day. And the "Me - Me - Me" message becomes quite irritating. The one bright spot - a cover of the Go-Gos' "Our Lips Are Sealed" seems perfectly suited to Duff's vocal stylings. The rest of the songs, boring as they are, stretch her limited range to the max. Hilary Duff, who can be charming one track at a time on a compilation, has trouble holding the listener's interest for the length of a whole album
1,I saw these guys open up for Lenny Kravitz at Saratoga, NY, like 5 years ago.  I thought that Buckcherry did pretty good, so I got their debut self-titled album.  I hate to say this, but this is the type of album with only one good song(Lit Up) on it and the rest is just filler.  Nonetheless, I think it's a great band to catch live.
1,Had to change my star rating becasue 1 star only had 7 and 2 star had 8 and I felt bad for 1 star but now I feel great. Like Dylans Street legal this gets last in more popular masterpieces, but this might be the best, I fyou don't buy it I'll let you  eride my bike if you like- Its got a bell and some whistles- its so nice that I stole it. Out of the big 4 floyd cds- this is the only one I still listen to often, I cant deny the greatness of DSOTM,wish you were here or the wall, but over the years I ve heard them so often that they don't really spark any awe or wonder- although Ive heard animals as much it just seems like there still something mysterious about it I can still listen to it nad be amazed- I hope they put it out on SACD- but thats why I think its the best of P.F. I consider all 4 to be masterpieces not to be missed. Oh eye its great to here this Album almost total ly live on In the flesh- amen.
1,LP is just a shadow of it's former self.  I liked the first 3 discs they had.  The last one was pretty good, but this is just horrendous.  don't waste your money on it.
1,i think she is a very interesting person and she does okay for others but her stuff is wack.she has no feeling in her music. Timberland is very bland and a one trick pony.very dinky and boring.nothing ever changes with her  work.
1,ok this CD is mostly junk. [i think] It has many weird and unusual songs. I like about two songs on here. "Brass Monkey" and "Fight for your right to party." Thats it. All of their other songs are so.... different. My oponion on this album is "Don't buy it." I am personally saying that because I am a BIG rock fan and a big fan of some rap. [like outkast] If you're into the Beastie Boys A LOT then go and buy this album. But i'm warning you, this is definately not like their newer stuff like "hello nastie." I personally think that the anthology is A LOT better than this album. If anybody wants this album and you're a rock fan, DON'T BUY IT!
1,This Ain't A Game is about doing to people with drugs with poison in them- Ray J gave poisoned cocaine to Whitney Houston=murder. Help stop black people music by buying Ray J's music. Murder is Ray J's game.
1,...just to give it 1 star to lower the 3 star average. I don't need to explain why this piece of $hit sucks. This is not music.
1,poor
1,Dying is Your Latest Fashion is one of my favorite albums of all times, and Ronnie is what makes it special. This theory was made fact when The Drug in Me is You first came out providing a little touch of the old Escape the Fate along with a little something else. Unfortunately, this "something else" has grown, and that's not a good thing. The something I'm referring to is Ronnie's ego which plagued The Drug in Me is You, especially in Tragic Magic. But enough about the past, let's talk present. Slap on this album and I think "huh, this isn't that bad... Yeah I could get into this!" And then he starts rapping and my heart drops. To make matters worse, he'll say something stupid in his god awful "rhymes" and my heart falls. (in reverse lol) And unfortunately, that's how it is every song (except for bad girl's club, I practically hunched over crying when I heard that one) Always starts strong, ends distasteful. Naturally, they're not all like this. Love Fashionably Late and Born to Lead is ok, other then that they're just as I said, good until the breakdown. Really don't care if the style is different, I just can't stand Ronnie's terrible rapping; it's so basic. Find it fitting to end this review on a sole point: I miss the old Ronnie.
1,Horrible ...it sounds like a FAKE Floyd Cramer...i want my money back.
1,Eh!
1,FILE UNDER: TTL. SH.T.		Having already demolished universally high expectations for the synth-reggae style with his previous opus, Killer an da Rampage, Eddy Grant sought to break hearts and butcher puppies with his doctorate in musical funkiness, the globally-reviled "Going for Broke".  With one hand dipped in his questionable Jamaican heritage and the other up his dreadlocked arse, Eddy managed to effectively kill off both his career and set Reggae back 10 years.  To add to the humiliation, his song "Romancing the Stone" was prominently displayed at the end of the dreadful Kathleen Turner when she was edible star vehicle "Jewel of the Nile."  Since JOTN was a sequel to RTS, everyone thought that Eddy was on crack for mistitling the "hit song" that played over the credits the name of the last film and not the one that they'd just seen.  No matter, within 6 months everyone had forgotten that any of this treacle had ever come to pass.		Yes, going for broke didn't pay off for Daddy CBS very well at all.  Now the CD is out of print, too, and you'll have to pay a lot to deserve hearing this masterpiece because the rest of the civilized world has deemed it utter garbage.		And Eddy Grant?  He's probably still playing Jamaican free fairs and hosting the local Kingston area version of "Ag-Day".		See also:		Puff Daddy, Shalamar, Rockwell, Johnny Gill, Big Mountain, etc.
1,Not one of Neil's better Crazy Horse projects.
1,Honestly, none of the songs are very memorable but it sounds slick and well-produced and ready for summertime playing. It's not going to sustain me through the whole summer though.
1,I don't like any songs on the album. I find track 11 quite 'shocking'. Stupid and ignorant. It is about prejudice against other people's cultures and religions and bombing countries. Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks who criticised his 'Angry American' Song was right when she said it made Country music sound ignorant. With his Taliban Song, TK definitely makes Country music sound ignorant and helps reinforce the idea that it is conservative and narrow-minded in many people's minds.
1,This is advertised as a Traffic reunion album.  It was released in 1994, 20 years after Traffic's last album.  There are 10 tracks that range in length from 4 minutes to 8 minutes.  It is 62 minutes long.  Sound quality is OK but muted (one of the problems with this album).		This CD is mostly a Steve Winwood solo project, and much of the CD sounds like it.  Jim Capaldi is here, playing drums, doing some singing and getting co-author credit on most of the tracks.  There are two guest musicians, one playing guitar and the other playing some kind of high pitched pipe on one of the tracks.  The rest is all Steve Winwood.  He actually edits in some flute and sax work from the deceased Chris Wood, but they are barely audible.		The music reminds me of some of Steve Winwood's solo albums, and Traffic's Where the Eagle Flies (which sounds more like a Winwood album than a Traffic album).  Steve Winwood's latest solo album sounds a lot like this album, only better.		There are only three really good tracks on this album, Some Kind Of Woman, Mozambique and Far From Home.  There are a number of mediocre tracks, like Every Day, Every Night and Riding High.		Some are just bad and are unpleasant to sit through.  These songs highlight what is generally wrong with this album.  The music is very muted.  Except for Capaldi's consistent drum beat, you can't really make out the instruments.  There is no dymanic range.  There are little bits of flute and sax that are barely audible.		You end up with just hearing Winwoods vocals.  While Winwood does have a great and unique soulful vocal style, it is difficult to sit through 60 minutes of just that.  On songs like Holy Ground, State Of Grace or This Train Won't Stop, what you hear is Winwood repeating the song title over and over again for minutes at a time, with subdued music in the background.  Holy Ground and State of Grace just drone on and on for 7 minutes each.		THE ISSUE ISN'T WHETHER THIS IS REALLY A TRAFFIC ALBUM OR A WINWOOD ALBUM.  BOTH TRAFFIC AND WINWOOD, BY HIMSELF, HAVE PUT OUT SOME GREAT MUSIC.  IT JUST THAT THIS ALBUM DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO THE BEST OF TRAFFIC OR WINWOOD.		After this album was released, Traffic went on tour.  Capaldi broke his arm and all he did was sing back up vocals.  Capaldi died last year.
1,I was very excited to pick up this CD when it first hit the shelves in '91-'92. I'm a huge fan of Asia, but I wasn't aware of a new disc being released. I was sure that there were new band members, but no listing of musicians on the back of the disc..., hmmm. There's only Geoff Downes name listed as a producer. That was enough for me at the time. I opened the CD to find the list of musicians, and see Carl Palmer pictured (Very poorly) as drums/percussion, Steve Howe on guitars, as well as Downes on keyboards. I believe that is where my disappointment started. No John Wetton. I listened to all the tracks, and wondered, "Where is Carl Palmer"?	A closer look revealed two other session drummers were playing, and I could tell Carl was playing on one, maybe two tracks (I'm a die hard CP fan). Disappointing.	Steve Howe makes an appearance on two tracks, oddly enough, the title "Aqua" (instrumentals, I&II). Good tracks, none the less, but only two, I did however like the mood the songs set very much.	Geoff Downes plays on all tracks here, but at this point, I didn't really care. I felt a little betrayed by the marketing and lack of information on the back of the disc. It would of been one thing to be proud of the work they did, but instead, I got smoke and mirrors.	This is not an Asia lineup I care to listen to. You can replace all musicians, in my opinion, except the lead singer, and still call yourself Asia. Geoff Downes must own the rights to the name (in fact, I learned much later after this review, John Payne does, he and Geoff no longer speak to each other). This is truly not an Asia effort, but should classify a Geoff Downes/John Payne effort, doing Asia songs on their live shows.	To lighten up a little, they are very big in Japan and Europe (Shall I pun, and say, "With Asia" too?). There are many people in America who prefer this lineup, which has been somewhat steady for over 18 years, that's six times longer than the tenure of the original Asia, less their all too brief 1990-1991 comeback and tour. (Update, the original Asia lineup is currently touring in 2007, and coming to a city near you, Yea!!)	Another bright spot is the track "Who Will Stop The Rain". It mostly reminds me of a top 40 sound (as a matter of fact, I seem to remember it was).	I don't fault all who played on this disc, but the way it was marketed and presented. Even the cover art leads a person to believe it's a Roger Dean Painting, who up until this disc had done all their cover art (It's not, but a well done Rodney Mathews painting with the Roger Dean "Asia" logo).	This disc, for me, is not worth a listen, other than the 2 Steve Howe songs, and you need to be a die-hard fan of his to collect this one.
1,cd was so scratched up will not play!
1,I was glad to see this release come out, particularly since I missed out on the excessively expensive Japanese SACD (@ $60), so I jumped on this upon first seeing it. I have a few other Pure Audio discs & they do sound stellar (and yes I do think they're better than SACD or vinyl), however this disc is a big disappointment. For starters, it is poorly manufactured.....it makes a huge racket in my player (Panasonic) since it is not evenly balanced in the tray, more than any other disc I own (and I own thousands of cd's dvd's & blu rays), so much so that it drowns out the music entirely (on about 33% volume). To add to that, this release contains nothing more than the original stereo album (3 different formats which don't sound terribly different). A Blu-ray can contain 50GB of information (over 50x a regular CD),  it is absurd to fill up the remainder of the disc (that doesn't have a 5.1 remix) with 2 identical copies in a different format (and paying Dolby licensing fees) rather than filling it up with the extra material (mono version of the album, demos, extra takes, b-sides etc.) that is on the 2xCD or the 4xCD box sets that have been previously released in a remastered/high-bit format (ie. the PCM track would be best) with the rest of the album. At such a high price point for just the album (not too mention having to then shell out for the separate releases to get the bonus material), I don't see this format becoming successful like blu-ray did for movies. As far as how good the remastering is, I can't tell with the loud racket of the disc spinning in my player.
1,lyrics about sex, drugs, and getting "crunk" catered to a young teenage crowd. Great. Screams and goofy hair to appeal to the scene crowd. fantastic. I use to find this stuff hilarious, although a white kid should never drop the "N bomb".... ever, but the joke is old.
1,Actually, The sound is not that great for a modern recording. The Isolde is very disappointing though so many say she is committed the the music. PLease, Shirley Verrett gave a much better performance of the Liebestod with	Mehta at Avery Fisher Hall around the same time and she was no Wagnerian. The orchestra is wonderful. Can't wait to get rid of it!
1,ReLoad is both the same album as, and the opposite of Load. The new sound of the band will be instantly recognizable from the opening riff of Fuel - but wait. Fuel goes along at a rapid clip that fans of Metallica's older, speedier works will appreciate way more than anything on Load. It's this first impression that made a lot of people hail ReLoad as a return to form after the disappointing Load.	Unfortunately, that's where the speed metal stops. The rest of ReLoad is the same mid-tempo country grooves in the heavy parts. Again, these grooves become tedious - but this time, there's no redemptive uber-ballads like there were on Load, except for Fixxxer. As a result, ReLoad drags on much more than it should.	The bright spots come in the aforementioned Fuel and Fixxxer, but The Memory Remains is another good track here. The lyrics are sadly ironic in the post-Napster and post-St. Anger period of Metallica's development, as in a sense they seem to be foretelling their own demise. It's probably the most tragic track Metallica has ever written - but nobody ever said that was a bad thing in metal.	At the end of the day, though, ReLoad is a rehash of the much-maligned Load with fewer bright spots. Buy with extreme caution.
1,Lenny Kravitz is perhaps the most mediocre, unoriginal and uninteresting musician of our generation. Emphasis on UNORIGINAL. He's a kitschy, commercialized, Diet Caffeine Free rip-off of Jimi Hendrix, minus everything good.
1,I can't believe that some people actually consider this to be a good album, let alone one of AC/DC's best.  Give me a break!  Is there a worse song in their entire catalog than Hail Caesar?  I certainly don't think so.  The Furor?  C'mon!  I've been a fan since '78 and I recall when I saw them  on this tour, that I sat behind some teenagers who stood up for the  Ballbreaker songs, but sat down for classics like The Jack.  What a society  we live in.  I don't know where I was going with that, but anyway, DON'T  BUY THIS CD!  Is that subtle enough?
1,The audio for this was completely remastered. and some will think that remastered is a good thing. it. is. NOT.	the Sound was so digital and the guitars were way to our in front. Compared to the original recording it is.. THERE IS NO COMPARISON.	there should be clearly stated that this is remastered and there should be a poll taken. Remastered or original recording... I would have to guess that most people would vote ORIGINAL!!!!
1,This is definitelly not a good compilation....Only got 10 songs....And only 1 song from FACELIFT, and 3 from the TRIPOD????If you really only want the mega hits MAN IN THE BOX and WOULD, they are here....but there's lots of great songs missing...SEA OF SORROW, WE DIE YOUNG, BLEED THE FREAK, RAIN WHEN I DIE, DOWN IN A HOLE, NUTSHELL....The truth is, buy FACELIFT, DIRT and JAR OF FLIES...3 masterpieces...and than buy the TRIPOD...ALICE IN CHAINS got way too much good stuff to be in a mediocre compilation with only 10 songs.
1,ANVIL was always s silly band, the kind of band that is responsible for giving heavy metal such a bad reputation. Their music is souless, noisy, ridiculous. IT has some energy, but asotutely no memorable moment. (and htis is their best album!! Imagine the others!!)
1,What's with the grunge/Disturbed/GWAR-type sound?  There's a couple of songs that are well written & played, but the rest sound like an old guy trying to fit in with the new.  Stick to playing bass.
1,God, another European power / melodic metal band !!! THis one had a good start, possessing Kai Hansen along their ranks. So I went for it !! What a deception!!! It's so repetitive, boring, dumb. If you like real metal, I can say these guy tried to do it, but failed miserably !!
1,this is my favorite Taylor Dayne album& i was looking forward to the remastered sound&unreleased bonus tracks from 2014 version which sounds like it would be a great inprovement on already great cd .but unfortunately i ended up getting a copy of the old origanal cd from 1989. i hope that the seller resolves this for me by returning my$$+ shipping since it was there mistake when i get the product i thought i was getting i will give a proper review of it
1,I realize there are millions of people out there who will purchase the great Paul McCartney's material, even if it was 45 minutes of the man's recorded snoring.  After all, it's Paul---greatest living songwriter, former Beatle.  But please---come on.  We should hold the man to a higher standard than this.  This stuff is just awful.  Virtually unlistenable, at least in my opinion.  Of course Paul is laughing all the way to the bank.		Want a decent, recent release by a former Beatle that is pretty good?  Get Ringo's "Liverpool 8".  At least Mr. Starkey is having fun, and releasing music you can actually listen to and sing along with.		And that's my Electric Argument.
1,Well I'm not sure where to start so I'm going to cut to the chase.  The singer can't sing. The drummer is ok.  Guitar riffs are so-so.  The lyrics aren't very good either.  There false stop is overused. Happens in every song from what I remember.  I only listened to this once or twice.  I Only Want You is the only good song on this cd.  I felt that on most of this album the band was going for catchy driving riffs but since they aren't very good, I heard gargled guitars with the same drum beat.  Avoid this please.  If you want catchy rythms with great lyrics, try Hot Water Music.
1,After the glorious series of thrash genre-defining classics of the 80s, Slayer moved over to less appealing simpler yet straight and violent music in the 90s with heavy influence of punk and hardcore.	Personally, I thought that this theme has got old even on this record's predecessor. Mostly because you can't provide much of a variety to songs, if you stick to this style.	This album generally continues what was done on "Diabolus in Musica", and so, it's absolutely secondary and fails to move me.	And the lyrics... Oh, man... I thought 40 years old people have something better to express with their lyrics than the stupid and childish "god hates us all" stuff. Araya used to write good lyrics, where's all that gone now?	Lyrics led me to believe that this record is aimed primarilly not on old fans of the band, but rather on a teenage nu-metal audience with a desire to "shock parents with real heavy music". I'm not one of those.	The only question that arises in my head is, why so many great bands fail to exit in style, when their time comes?
1,Buyer beware. This is a bootleg. This is not an official Apple or Beatles release. Proceed with caution & be sure to research before you purchase.
1,It's been eleven years since the last Aerosmith studio album, 2001's Just Push Play (and there's also been the 2004 covers album Honkin' On Bobo) which was really a product of its time with the band collaborating with producers that gave them a clean modern pop sound. This time around they brought back producer Jack Douglas who worked on some of the band's best albums in the 1970's. With the inner problems in the band and the near breakup, Steven Tyler doing American Idol fans were beginning to wonder if there was any recording going. It took a long time but Aerosmith's 15th studio album, Music From Another Dimension is here. Initially the band said it would be a throwback to Toys in the Attics (1975) and Rocks (1976) and there are glimpses of that, but there's also glimpses of the 80's and 90's Aerosmith too and a LOT of ballads. It's as if all eras of the band are blended in one album and that's their sound in 2012.  I got to hand it to them, for a band of men in their 60's there's some pretty rocking material here, and I find that the band does vocals harmonies quite a lot this time around(actually they sound like they wouldn't be out of place on a Def Leppard album). There's some good but to me it's an overall underwhelming Aerosmith album.		The ups with MFAD are the strong rock track. In fact the album starts off rather with a string of three solid rock songs. "LUV XXX" starts out with a spoken intro before kicking it into high gear, I wish the entire album was like this, it's genuinely one of the best Aerosmith songs that's been done since the 1970's. It has that vibe from Toys/Rock era and it's fantastic. "Beautiful" is commercial Aerosmith at its best, it's catchy, the vocal harmonies are excellent and the songs is very likeable as a whole. " Legendary Cild"  is a Grip a Grip era song that never saw the light of day. I was intrigued at first and when I listened to it I thought to myself "this could work", and it does it rocks and it's catchy enough I really like this one. "Can't Stop Loving You" with Carrie Underwood is puzzling, having her on an Aerosmith album is obviously not going to well with some of the fans and it's just not that good of a duet. "This Could Have Been Love" was chosen as the single and no surprise, it's a ballad.  I actually like this one, even if it's a 1990's Aero ballad rehash sounding or cheesy or sappy, I can acknowledge all of this but it still works for what is. "Street Jesus" has more of a classic rock edge to it, with even some jamming parts and the result is a longer, more vintage sounding track that works fairly well, it's one of those the hardcore fans will enjoy the most. The Joe Perry sung track "Freedom Fighter" is one of the best songs on this album for me, it's got a good Perry riff and even thought his voice isn't particularly great the song manages to rocks. "Another Last Goodbye" is a fitting ballad to end the album, it's a good one but it's overshadowed by the fact that there are too many ballads on MFAD to truly stand out.		The first half of the album, I have generally good things to say about and it sounds promising and it makes you think that yes, maybe Aerosmith has some of the old rock sound we love back and it's going to be an entire album like this. Then there's the second side, filled with ballads and it really breaks the album's flow. A big part of the problem is that the album suffers from the too much ballads syndrome that was present on albums like Get A Grip, and they sound mostly like 1990's Aerosmith ballads. Six/seven (depending on who you ask) ballads on an album is just too much, and I like ballads but these are for the most part just sappy and rehashed songs that they've already done, except not as good or passionate. There's just no overlooking that many ballads is overkill. The worst part is a duet with Carrie Underwood, no offense but what's she doing on an Aerosmith album? Especially one which was reported as "back to their roots".  I found some of the lyrics here to be the band's most juvenile yet, which is rather humorous coming from men in their sixties. Then again the album has 15 tracks, maybe a little too much and if they removed some of the ballads and Diane Warren songs (still using outside writers it seems) it would have come across as a tighter effort, it comes across as a modern version of Get A Grip (some good rock songs, plenty of ballads and it has over 14 songs and an outtake from that album as well) . Most of those ballads sound like they're trying to be part II of "Amazing", "Crying" or "Don't Wanna Miss A Thing". 15 songs may just be a little too much, if they cut some of it down it would have made for a shorter, tighter more Rock album, that's my take on it.		Like many fans, it's hard for me to hide my disappointment. Still better than Just Push Play that's for sure, but I expected more from the hype Aerosmith had around this release. There are things to like but there's some that bring down the experience ultimately. I listened to it a few times by now and I can honestly say my rating is a 2  out of 5. Some of the Rock tracks are reminiscent of classic Aerosmith and energy charged tunes but overall it comes off as an album that didn't know what direction it wanted to take. There have been some great releases by Classic bands this year, but sadly Aerosmith's is not one of them I'm afraid.
1,NOT IMPRESS
1,No real metal band would even consider playing with a SYMPATHY ORCHESTRA even if it was offered to them for FREE.This proves Metallica have hit an all time low.
1,I'm a Randy Newman junkie.  Can't get enough.  I love his wit, I love his pain, I love his soundtracks and I even loved these songs.  .  .  the first time.  Every one of them sounds like something he's done before.  From such an original and unique artist this was a complete disappointment.		That said, I still love ya Randy.
1,I knew that this album was an older lo-fi set of recordings.  However, it is a little too much for my liking.  It sounds like a teenager singing poems in a make-shift studio in her basement.  You also get the pleasure of hearing Karen say "um...1,2,3,4" before every song.  It's just really, really sleepy music without any of the good stuff to make it more bearable.
1,After the Grammy-winning success of her previous set FALLING INTO YOU, Celine Dion was under the typical pressure one gets when following up a massively huge album.  Too bad she didn't take a little longer to seek out better material, because LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE not only fails to live up to the stunning promise of FALLING INTO YOU, but stands as her worst album in an already uneven catalog of work.  First off, she pads the album with big-name guest stars, and only the Bee Gees come off with any dignity in tact.  The duet with idol Barbra Streisand on 'Tell Him'comes across more like a who-can-outsing-who marathon rather than a great record, and the Pavarotti duet is just idiotic--the two artists are too different vocally to ever gel into a melodically pleasing duet track.  She also attempts a channeling of Toni Braxton on 'Why Oh Why', and the results are mediocre--sorry, but nuance isn't exactly a staple of Dion's vocal work.  Other snoozers include both Corey Hart-produced tracks('Miles To Go' and Where's The Love'), as well as the awful remake of an already bad song, 'When I Need You'.  On the very small plus side, the Bee Gees track 'Immortality' is very pretty, and she steps up the tempo to great effect on the reggae-styled 'Treat Her Like A Lady' and the club thumper 'Just A Little Bit Of Love'.  She also provides career high vocal work on both 'To Love You More' and the ubiquitous TITANIC hit 'My Heart Will Go On'.  Unfortunately, these few bright spots can't make up for what on the whole is a totally mediocre display of Dion's considerable vocal talents.
1,I was really excited about this album, so I went out the day it came out and bought it. When I played the first track for the first time, I was disgusted. I figured maybe the next song would be better. It wasn't. I don't think the album gets good until around the 6th track, "Saved," and the 7th track "Mirror Remains" is good too. The first 5 songs are just terrible. Track 9 "the Dog's a vapor" is also good- dark and moody, But the last track isn't the song that should have ended the album. I HIGHLY recommend listening to all the sound clips to make sure you want to buy this. Not many of the songs are catchy or worth listening to more than once.		I gave this disc several spins before I decided to review it. I really tried to give it a chance, but the first 5 songs are really unimpressive. The 3 songs I like, I really like. The other 7 songs make me wish they had cut out the filler and spent more time writing something worth paying money for. Make sure this is NOT the first Bauhaus record you buy, because you will be disappointed.
1,The first thing I noticed when I started listening to this recording was how closely the solo violin was recorded (and both soloists in the double concerto). The violin is given no breathing room by the microphones. Consequently, I never listen to this recording. It is one of the worse sounding recordings I own. What a shame, because it's my favorite performance of these pieces.
1,Just one song was ok
1,This my opinion. They suck. I love rock music. But I don't like Nirvana.
1,i didn't like this cd. it wasn't that great.
1,"Oooga booga, florga, dead SMASH! Ooga booga, Kill!!!!,  oooo CHOP UP BODY PARTS!!! Orrnniaaweerff!!!  Monga Dooga!  Derka derka!!!!  Kill!! Virgins!!! GRRRRRRRR!!!!!! I WILL KILL!!!

The Most Overrated and Pathetic Death Metal band in history.  For real stuff, listen to Vader, Malevolent Creation, Possessed, Morbid Angel (even bad Morbid Angel is better then this), etc.  This is stuff that Serial Killers jack off to.  Speaking of Serial Killers, Macabre is good too.  Good Death Metal has lyrics that aren't thought up in 5 minutes, aren't the exact same album repeated over and over, has great guitar solos (these guys suck), and a better drummer (this guy is average at best, check out Vader), and better yet, has a vocalist that has range, volume and can actually annunciate words.  Hope this helped or ticked you off.  Pressing the helpful or not helpful button, either way makes me happy.
1,Maybe I'll be drawn and quartered for this, but this is their weakest effort. Just because it had the "best" producer, biggest budget, and they had a cookie cutter three and a half minute song with a chorus sung 8,000 times on MTV doesn't mean this is an album of the decade. Honestly it took me three times before I could even get through the first half of this record. I found it that unimpressive. And still do. Its slightly above generic alt rock or whatever the hell MTV would label this as. If you're going to get any ATDI, please do yourself a favor and get Vaya and In/Casino/Out, then Acrobatic Tenements third. Actually, don't even bother with this one at all.
1,Oh...oh my god....when I listened to those samples I just had to say something. I was shocked at the number of people who thought this album 'rocked' or whatever. It's so bad...it's good. I laughed for over 3 hours listening to 'It's Halloween'....what the hell is this? Drums being played at random while the guitarist (i feel bad giving her this name) played worse then maybe my dog, while the bloody vocalist is drunk and on drugs or something! I mean come on people, what's with this stupid [stuff]?	Never in my life have I heard something as bad. Never.	Stay away....
1,Concert from the new material, according to the sources was filmed using multiple cameras of HD, my question that if I'm not mistaken mine is a DVD-5 with one audio only, and BTW very poor in quality in comparison to the video quality, and why compressing a HD source to a DVD-5 for an 1-1/2 hour concert with a single audio...???
1,Well after my last scathing review of this album, someone had Amazon.com pull it because it was "offensive."  It wasn't.  If it was anything, my review was honest.  So to paraphrase what I said before: I am not a fan of John Lennon or the Beatles, so maybe my opinion is biased, but I did not enjoy listening to this album in my friend's car.  While the Beatles did rock at times, and while "rocking" is not the only good thing in music, I feel with this album someone is trying to make some extra $$$ off the work of a long since deceased man, and has therefore not cared about the quality of the album whatsoever.  It is not well done, and I believe it to sound rather poor considering what they could have made it sound like.
1,This isn't one that my husband cared much for, The Rocky Mountain High CD is better. Doubt we will buy more John Denver.
1,Once again, I was in Pembroke Lakes Mall in one of the stores, "Tilly's," when I first heard this song.  It's pretty fast for such heavy beats.  It can be compared to MGMT's "Kids."  This song just debuted so I know I purchased it from this site.  I don't have my laptop with me right now, where I know exactly all my Amazon.com purchases.  Loving it!
1,Guess who's back? 50 Cent. And so am I so I can tell the people of America the worst album of 2005. Last year Ashlee Simpson's "Autobiography" took home honors, and now 50 Cent's "The Massacre" is our new award winner. And for all the gangster suburban teenyboppers who are going to give me a bunch of negative votes when this review will save your life, or at least your music life, unless you commit suicide after spending your hard, earned cash on trash from 50 Cent.		I like music. I listen to music acts like Metallica, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, The Who and The Beatles. Also as for modern performers, I like listening to rappers like Nas, Jay-Z, Kanye West and nu-metal acts like System of a Down. Old rap like Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and the fathers of gangsta rap, N.W.A. and Ice Cube. So, this is talented performers. And then along comes this whole little commercial bubble-gum pop-rap like 50 Cent, G-Unit and Twista and all that other garbage. They release albums, get played out on MTV and the radio and become multi-billionaires with bodyguards, cooks and drivers.		50 Cent's "The Massacre" is torture. ALl the beats suck. Especially on the hit "Just A Lil Bit", which is quite possibly the worst song written in the last 15 years. "Disco Inferno" is a carbon-copy of "On Fire" from Lloyd Banks. And then "Candy Shop"... 50 Cent dissed Ja-Rule for making queer, wimpie songs with Ashanti. So he makes a bubble-gum pop song like "Candy Shop" with Olivia who has half the talent of Ashanti. The biggest disgrace ever is that 50 Cent ruined Ja-Rule, yet he is copying his exact style which would lead to Ja-Rule's downfall, which now its 50 Cent's downfall. Everything else wouldn't cut it on any other album, and are just filler.		Since 2003's "Get  Rich or Die Tryin'", 50 Cent has completely been hypocritical acting like he is all hard and he is really not because he ain't shooting or killing anyone lately. Get lost buddy, because maybe a great 2Pac type rapper will come along and show the rap long and put an end to 50 Cent. That will be the day... as for now, your mission is to show everyone who listens to this some great rap, like Public Enemy or the Beastie Boys. ANd then get them into good rock. So white kids, give me all negative votes, cause you know that this sucks!
1,Based on other reviews I had much greater expectations on this CD.  I guess I should have reviewed the lyrics, but the predominant theme on most songs is death--suicide, dying, and killing.  This is definitely not something I want to repetitively have piped into my brain.  I wish there were a way to "return" it.
1,I've been a fan of Destiny's Child since they came out -- since I was a KID. I'm 16 now, I own all their albums and I've never been so disappointed! I'm not their biggest fan, but in the past I have loved their entire albums. This one...doesn't fit that description at all.		My first thought was "11 tracks? really?". That seemed surprisingly short in comparision to the their previous LP's. Then I heard "Lose My Breath". And WOW it was a hot track. Then "Soldier". So already, I'm like "This album is going to be off the hook, two awesome tracks already!"		I get it, listen to it...and....yeah, not what I was expecting. "Lose My Breath" and "Soldier" are the only good songs, and "Cater 2 U" is a nice song too. But other then that, the album is just full of cheesy songs about...LOVE. Love is nice, yes, BUT NOT AN ENTIRE ALBUM FULL OF IT! I'm not one to love "slow" songs, sometimes, but not these one's. Overall, the album is very boring. I don't understand, they say they want to show their vocal range, but I can hear a good, no excellent range on a song like "Soldier".		I'm hesitant to even give this album 3 stars, overall it deserves a 1 or 2. Also, I'm not going to review each track, it's not really worth it, considering I can't even get through the entire song after track 3.		This album was recorded in 3 weeks I hear and it shows. It was clearly made of material that didn't make Beyonce's album (gosh, that album had alot of filler, but it had about 7 good songs, not 2!). I felt that DC3's return to the game was really rushed. Beyonce was still winning awards for her solo effort when the "Destiny Fulfilled" was releasd. I think they should have waited till the summer and taken time to re-think the material on this album.		I am giving it 2 stars. One for each of the hot tracks on the album!
1,Somewhere along the line I realized that Weezer was actually part of the radio that I hate, instead of how they were once one of the few shining spots in the desolate wasteland otherwise known as today's FM radio stations.  The other day I was listening to the radio and a My Chemical Romance song came on and I actually suffered through it and kept it on but when Beverly Hills came on their was no such luck, I turned that radio knob to off.  Maybe it is just nostalgia for the Weezer of old that makes me find Weezer's new stuff better than some of the dregs of modern rock radio today, but seriously Weezer are pretty damn bad now.  For a long time I was in denial and looking for excuses for why Weezer turned into what they are.  In a sense I am still in denial, I pretty firmly believe that this level of suckitude displayed on Maladroit and now Make Believe is due to his decision to be celibate.  Once Rivers was a hip nerd, sexually frustrated, occassionally sad and angry, just like the majority of youth and young adults.  Now he's turned into some present day mainstream rock Gandhi, instead of not eating to save and free the people of a repressed country, Rivers chooses to give up sex in the name of something.....probably just for a few more articles in the music magazines every year.  Anyway, River's indifference towards intimate acts is not the problem, but his apparent indifference towards two mainstays of good music, decent lyrics and catchy melodies.  It's as if his attitude towards romance has carried on through the rest of his life.  That, or Rivers finally stopped being turned down by asian girls due to his overwhelming popularity and his now just ready to coast on his reputation.  Weezer have finally probably achieved what they've always wanted to, popularity and acclaim, and they've done absolutely nothing with it.  Since no obstacles exist anymore, no effort is put in and here we have the result, Make Believe.  Make Believe hints at Rivers Cuomo being very self-aware and hopes that the great deal of Weezer apologists currently circling around dozens of message boards today will just `make believe' that this isn't a big pile of.....really bland and cliched music.  There really anything of any positive value on this album.  One plus I can say is that none of this sounds like rehashed Cheap Trick like on Maladroit, but then again a few of these songs sound like rehased Cars.  One would wonder how Rivers ever gets through Harvard U with some of the insipid poetry thrown across Make Believe, the chief violator being the single Beverly Hills, which sounds a bit like a b-side of a b-side of Pinkerton that has been thoroughly ravaged through a cover by a local band consisting of thirteen year old girls.  Yep, this album is pretty terrible.  Maybe it's a good idea Cuomo chooses not to reproduce.
1,Hick hop?  Give me a break.  LOL.....this is nothing more than recycled, tired rap/hip hop.
1,Perhaps six is an unlucky number. Prior five Motown Definitive Collection purchases were wholly satisfying. This CD's fidelity is atrocious. Worse, record skipped twice. Sadly, had to return disc.
1,First off id like to say ive been a disturbed fan since the beginning. I own Sickness, believe, and 10k fists.		this album disappoints. I popped in the cd. i went through each song. over half the songs on the CD start off with the Drums banging and beating, sometimes slow sometimes fast. then the guitars kick in. then the unemotional vocals kick in.		Seriously, if u actually listen to how boring the vocals are, youll be like, WOW, hes just going through the motions. just reading the lyrics off a paper.		Indestructible was ok. i liked the verse, the chorus was boring.		Inside the fire, best song on the cd, hands down. definately best choice for the single.		Deceiver has a catchy chorus, besides that the song is bland.		the night is overall an average song.		perfect insanity has a good guitar solo. other than that the song is useless.		haunted, enough, the curse, torn, and criminal are all the same old stuff. nothing new or original. no innovation.		divide has the potential to be an amazing song. they were going in the right direction when making it, but then the chorus...just really disappointing.		facade is a horrible way to go out. another bland song.		theres 2 bonus songs, Run and Parasite. they are on special edition cds or sumthing.		run is actually an average song. too bad it wasn't on the real album.		parasite sounds like indestructible on the verse, but the chorus is ok.		OVERALL-	bland, unoriginal, boring, no innovation. disturbed is on thier 4th album and hasn't evolved anywhere. this album seriously should be called 'ten thousand fists 2.0'
1,Now we have some choke artist like Guerilla Black trying to be a Big impersonator. Biggie is from NY, not Cali. And its funny how people are mad that we are saying hes a Biggie wannabe. If you want to hear some Biggie, go buy and listen to Ready To Die, Life After Death and Born Again. You know its true so admit it and get off this mans nads.
1,No comments
1,porno videos, crappy music.  If you want a good A-ha buy foot of the mountain, this one sucks all around.
1,Heed the editorial reviewer's warning about lack of heart.  The playing on this disc is a stunning technical achievement to be sure, and any guitarist listening will end up with a bruised jaw from hitting the floor so many  times.  But it is also a disc that only a guitarist can appreciate; most  non-guitarists will find it to be a virtuostic blend of white-noise, and  ultimately too much of a good thing.  From the first five minutes, the  players present everything they can do, and the mystery is lost for the  rest of the listening time.  There is no sense of pacing, and no climax  (unless you consider the entire recording a perrenial climax).  Bottom  line:  a must-listen for guitarists, if only so they can know what the  human hand is capable of doing on the instrument.  Even then, I said  "must-listen" - check it out before shelling out any money,  because you may find that it grows tired quickly (as I did).  Everyone else  should avoid it.  Incidentally, all three players are essential listening  individually, and should be checked out on other must-own recordings,  guitarists and non-guitarists alike.  This just happens to be the least  essential in any of their repetoires.
1,I love progressive rock but not from Opeth.  The key gripe here is that I liked Opeth because it WAS progressive METAL.  There are so many bands that already sound like this release...and dare I say better?  I get that not all artists want to do metal all their career, and even understand they may want to experiment with sound. But to me without Opeth's signature sound they sound  like Riverside, Anathema, or Katatonia.		I really wanted to like this but this feeling of disappoint won't go away.  Thus, though I would be open to the music that I normally listen to, what I liked about Opeth is gone and that sucks for this fan.
1,Hey, the reason I listen to Bette is BETTE!  The remix is slammin', but then I realized, where are the vocals? Sure, she makes an appearance here and there, but JEEZ. And it's not just this remix. This has become a trend  in remixing lately, and I, for one, don't like it. Keep on giving us those  hot beats, guys and girls, but PLEASE keep the vocals in! The I'm Beautiful  remixes are for Bette completists ONLY! Anyone know of any remixes of I'm  Beautiful out there that KEPT the vocals?
1,This is so bad that it brings a whole new level of meaning to trailer trash!
1,THis whiny emo/power pop, And compairing to the beatles is just silly. the beatles wrote good music
1,Having seen&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/5-Classic-Albums-1970-1973/dp/B00857S822/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">5 Classic Albums 1970-1973</a>&nbsp;from 2012 unboxed, with its decent looking gatefold sleeves and sturdy box, this new reissue was a huge disappointment. They've changed all 5 sleeves into singles now, losing the gatefolds means the already lacking liner notes are now completely gone as well as inner-fold  pictures. To make matters worse, two of mine were poorly glued, out of alignment.		Luckily the CDs themselves arrived free of scratches and scuffs (which are common to these card sleeve releases which record companies won't spend 2 cents to protect with inner sleeves unless you buy from Japan). All 5 discs are the 1995 remasters and 4 of them contain bonus tracks. Sound quality seems to be excellent though I haven't played all 5 discs through yet. A total of 59 Elton John tracks. With the crappy packaging, you're basically upgrading from digital versions only in terms of getting CD sound quality.		I HIGHLY recommend getting the 2012 version before it's gone, and as I write this it's even cheaper than this version!
1,I'll give Britney  Spears  dap for a 2-3 cuts that I have liked by Her. but let me tell you it ain't because of Her Voice it has all to do with the Production of the cut. She is the Modern Day Era of what a Studio can generate&what a Label can put out here. I ain't madd at her at all. I respect Her Hustle,but lets be real there ain't much there in terms of Music vibe.every era has a Britney type of Artist that catches on&oh well they have a few decent cuts but that doesn't make a Greatest hits.
1,Please ignore the title.		Green Day had two good albums:		"1039 / Smoothed Out Slappy Hours"		and "Kerplunk."		The others were decent, but not something I would really ever listen to. This is complete trash. Billy Joe spouts off about how much he hates corporate America, and then I turn on MTV and there he is, either being interviewed or playing on a video. The album, supposedly, is an attack on the state of America, yet, from what I see, the ones listening are the rich teeny boppers who used mommy and daddy's money to buy this trash.		The lyrics on "American Idiot" are vague and uninteresting, especially on the hit single "Blvd. of Broken Dreams." The music itself is the same Green Day music we've been hearing for ten years. Come on, boys, do something new.		If this is political punk than Celine Dion is early DC hardcore. Listen to Bad Brains, Agnostic Front, or Fugazi.
1,This is England is an inspired song which taps into a lot of the social unrest that was still present in Thatcher's Britain - "Ive got my motorcycle jacket but I'm walking all the time." The rest of the song seem like a disappointing football game, they just glide along, without making any real impression on you at all. Generally, this album is only for completists. There is so much better material in the Clash's back catalogue that is worthwhile and you may as well go back to The Clash / The Clash, or London's Calling or Give 'em Enough Rope.
1,this cd is doooodoooo poooopoooo! wayne can barely hold your attention rappin so what was he thinking when he was doin this? you can say what you want and it don't matter if you are a die hard rap fan or rock fan THIS CD IS FARTHEAD MATERIAL ONLY FARTHEADS LISTEN TO THIS! wayne aint talkin bout NOTHIN as usual but to make it worse its over rock and roll beats which would be good if he had a real songwriter or something but it doesnt work here at all!. don't buy this people download it and listen to it and laugh at the attempt this guy made to crossover! ice t, cypress hill, and even outkast made an interesting effort crossing over from hip hop to other genres but this is not one of them, this is almost as worse as the black eyed peas trying to be pop singers now!
1,Not much to say other than I only really care for one song on this album.  Good work, just not my taste.
1,I loved the balance in the first album but Chris's song writing and gratingly high pitched voice on the majority of this album was hugely disappointing to me. No real duets with Sara, only one instrumental track...basically a solo Chris album. He drowns out the great background instrumentals which are the key to Nickel Creek's success! And, frankly, I prefer Sara's soft voice (ala Alison) to his as she subtly accentuates the music. Anyway, I haven't listened much, but I can guarantee you there will be many tracks I'll skip (Green and Gray is awful)every time I listen.
1,Poor
1,YAWN! I think the folks in Dream Theater need to stop trying so hard. They'll NEVER be as good as Slipknot or Staind. Just give up, guys! You suck. All of the songs sound the same. To write a Dream Theater song, it needs to have	1.) a 13:00+ running time	2.) 4/4 drumming	3.) inaudible bass	4.) whiny vocals (seriously, LaBrie can't sing for his life!)	5.) lame, three-chord guitar playing.	You guys suck, and so do your dorky fans! Everyone listen to St. Anger by Metallica if you want a real sense of metal.
1,can't tell because no track list.
1,Very talented band, great music, but the lyrics are crap.  Almost like they worship the devil or something.  Not necessary.  Probably ruined their career.  This is probably on of the most musical and hard driving cd's I have heard, but i can't listen to it because of the stupidity of the lyrics.
1,As in the awful "BJS" album, the singer tries to find out what all the fuss is about in the youth market. The result sounds like a parody album. On some tracks, it sounds like a bad Karaoke performance.	  In particular, "Free the People" is painful, especially when compared with the Delaney and Bonnie original. Bonnie Bramlett, as idiosyncratic a singer as she is, still shows much better range than the famous Barbara.	 Likewise, the Randy Newman covers are vapidly done, with none of the menace or energy that Randy brings to his songs.	  This album is basically a form of Muzak. Live high energy music filtered and sanitized for the housefrau set.	  Barbra sounds much better when she sticks to corn and schmaltz.	  Fer cryin out loud, this piece of crap was in stores RIGHT NEXT TO THE ORIGINALS!		 Do yourself a favor and listen to the originals. If you can stand her versions, you might find something new to enjoy as well!
1,The album was well-reviewed and sold better in its first week than anything Paul has done in a long time.  That just shows you how pathetic	the music business has become.  People were probably just thinking, "Please, save us, Paul.  Write something GOOD."		Well... this album is kind of "out there."  Put together the weirdest tracks from The Beatles' White Album, and parts of Paul's early "Ram" album, and that's what this is.  Too much of it just isn't very... "musical".	It's kind of noisy and unpleasant at times.		Even the introspective slower songs have dull lifeless melodies with no hook that just don't go anywhere.  You could listen to this CD 10 times, and with the exception of  "Dance Tonight" (getting exposure in the iPod TV commercials) you won't remember a single song on it.  Does anybody remember anything from "Ram" except "Maybe I'm Amazed"??? My point exactly.		The White Album was great because it had songs like Back in The USSR, Glass Onion, and Dear Prudence on it, not because of "Why Don't We Do It In The Road".  Well, this CD has too much "weird", and not enough basic well-written rock and roll on it.		As far as I'm concerned, Paul hasn't done a good album since 1997's Flaming Pie (and 1989's Flowers In The Dirt before that).  And that include Chaos And Creation (another one for the dumpster.)  He puts out some gems, but since his days with The Beatles, his good efforts are few and far between.
1,Let me begin this review by saying that God Ween Satan, as an album, gets an easy five stars from me. It's fun, rockin', and funny--one of the staples of my high school days. However, this particular vinyl re-issue by Plain Records is woefully disappointing. Plain Records is quickly earning a nasty reputation from vinyl enthusiasts due to its track record of lackluster LP reissues, and this one is sadly no exception. The music is muddy and lifeless with no definition to the mix, and the volume is oddly low. This is the third edition of this album I've bought (following the original 1990 Twin Tone CD and the 2001 Restless CD remaster), and this is the worst by a mile. I'm seriously starting to wonder what sources these guys are cutting their records from because they have absolutely no dynamics, depth, or warmth to them. Don't let the 180-gram vinyl fool you either. It may be 180 grams, but that doesn't matter when the mastering is so pitiful. It's really a shame Plain hasn't figured out what they're doing because they're releasing tons of great albums that deserve much better treatment. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Stick with the CD.
1,It's About Time was a decent album...but...		this is total rubbish.		Anyone who says this is the best CD they've ever bought, you need to dump out your music collection and start over.		Milian just does an urban-like effort. But it's weak as ever. No good singing, and have you heard HOT BOY? She would like to cook a steak up and sit in the passenger side?		Skip this one. There was a REASON Jay-Z booted her off Island.
1,By the simple expedient of butchering the Stones' UK albums, the band's American record company managed to churn out about twice as many LPs as the Brits did. Needless to say, quality control was not concern number one. Flowers collects 12 tracks without rhyme or reason; half of these had already appeared on the US versions of Between The Buttons and Aftermath, and as for the other half ... My Girl may be the single worst thing the band ever recorded; Jagger sounds like he was reading the financial pages of The Times when he did the vocal. As a monument to record company greed and mismanagement, Flowers is of interest; otherwise avoid unless you really, really need everything the band ever did.
1,This collection of songs isn't even close to her last effort of this type which was titled Timeless.  Timeless was a great CD that highlighted the skill of one of the best vocalists of our time.  No aspect of Everlasting meets the same standard as Timeless.
1,Disturbed's last two albums both demonstrated more musical range and sincere ability. Granted, this album may be considered a better  real metal album, it is certainly lacking in diversity. To begin with, 8 or 9 of the songs sound very similar to one another.		Also, there are only 2 or 3 really good rock tracks on here; in their prior albums, I would occasionally listen from start to finish but with this cd, there is no chance of that.		If you are somehow new to disturbed, don't be tricked by this lame offering, go pick up believe and the sickness.
1,I wonder with, 2 Mill sold does my word count ???		I trully hope so because they "cant stop me even if they stopped me" the real smart words of Wayne himself.		There are 3 reasons for why this album is selling -		3. Marketing, Marketing and Marketing . .  The music industries new face for sales as 50 is out and now Wayne is in .		2. All of the hype from the MixTapes being with his great lyrics and people are finally thinking HipHop could run thru the vains of a new rapper ? But actually that was the lie . . . . . Its just the smoke and mirrors, Mixtapes where CRAZY and flow was a little weak (id thought since the beats wernt his but don't worri . . . still good) . . but his album came . . . still same.		1. XXL - Most anticpated album for 07 . . . Also XXL one of the worst magazines ever made (only made big due to 50, Eminem and Dre all dissing THE SOURCE magazine)		XXL somehow gave the power aaaaaaaaall to Wayne single handlely with that ?		Then wayne said his whole! album was Leaked on the net so he would put that album out as a sale regardless calling it 'The Leak' ??		When it came to sell . . . ? only 4 songs for sale ??		Then took another year for his album to be realesed ? Listening to this album, it was because he still not have a BANGIN song yet produced AKA:Lollipop .		The final being is that i wouldve given this album at least 3 stars . . . but he has NO! rythm . . . and he's comparing himself Big and Pac ??		Then he makes funny noises like 'Haaa Haaaaaa' - A milli .		Then in a concert he walks around a screaming fan just staring - Check London Wayne Concert on youtube.		Wayne honestly thinks he's thug . . . thats the problem .  But too many NON hiphopers (whiteboys who like too much of FloRida) will defend this crap album .		What ever happend to that hip hop made for bobbing your head in car ? This album does not have that material, it has the typical 'pass' album tracks .		Funky and New Trend song (new hiphop is always bout making a trend of somesort) - Lollipop		Song with one of the most powerful hiphop artists and mainly! praise him so you can be praised - Mr. Carter		Always at least a reeeeeal sad song so you can pass thru every genre of people instead of all 'club hits' - Tie My Hands		And still no head bobbing shhh but there is one Mrs. Officer (but as usual in new hip hop) they try an make it a 'Trend' by doing the 'WEEEEE O WEEEEEEE O WEEEE' . . .		Its like NaS explained, people ARE laughing at the blacks of today as they are turning into slaves again, slaves of whiteboys and just please the whiteboys an done deal .		3 Stars due to its a oooook album, but 2 due to how HUGE this album (all to marketing) has blown and when NaS's album is 10!!! times better.		Summarise: New Face, New Selling Tool and New Whiteboy Hip Hop
1,When I heard "Heaven" I rushed to purchase this CD. Take "Heaven" as a prelude to what this CD is; a bad cover tunes album. "California Dreamin'" is so bad I could not get through half of it. And the original stuff is predictable and boring. Besides, who needs the "Bonus" slow version or "Heaven" anyway. Save your money. Download "Heaven" for a mere 99 cents.
1,I listened to this four times before writing this review.  I actually WANTED to like it.  Dream Theater is always listed as one of the top Heavy Metal bands and  I've read MANY reviews comparing them to Metallica. I've also read that this is generally considered their best album and a great introduction to the band.  All I can say folks is...this isn't at all what I would consider Metal.  Not even close.  It isn't that they use keyboards (I love Dio and he used them often), it isn't that their complex (so are Megadeth and Metallica)...it's not even that they're not HEAVY (love me some Van Halen).  What I don't like about it is that they have all of the passion and power of Styx...which in my opinion is awful.  It's weak.  They are literally a modern day version of Styx.  Metal IS power and passion, imo, and I get none of that in this music.  I feel like I'm listening to elevator music.		I don't doubt that these guys are fantastic musicians and know what they're doing, but I just don't feel it.  Further, how anyone can classify them heavy metal or compare them musically to Metallica is beyond me.  A huge disappointment.
1,Everybody likes '5 o'clock World'  and it is a a great track with a deserving following but there really isn't another track on this album that is anywhere near the awesomeness of that track.
1,The Southern Death Cult was one of the old British post-punk/goth bands of the late '70s and early '80s, these days best remembered for being the launching pad for the Cult.  And honestly, that's probably the way they're best remembered.		The band was a quartet led by vocalist Ian Astbury.  Even at this early stage, Astbury's aggressive and powerful vocals were quite apparent, he dominates every moment he's at the microphone, but unlike the Cult with Billy Duffy's guitar to offer foil for Astbury, there's nothing in the Southern Death Cult to match him.  Instead, Astbury sits on top of a background reminiscent of early work by the Cure and Joy Division.  The band's total released output was one 12" single, this is presented along with some radio sessions, a few live tracks and some unreleased studio material.		Taking on the 12" first-- the three tracks all feature pretty much the same pattern, goth-styled cleantone guitars are the order of the day, with Astbury's undeniable presence on top of it all.  But at its best, the music is somewhat dull even if Astbury is inspired ("The Fatman") and at its worse, Astbury seems unsure of himself and doesn't really know where to go (the other two tracks).		The two radio show pieces are pretty much more of the same-- ranging between dull goth ("Flowers in the Forest") or totally lacking whenever Astbury doesn't sing ("All Glory").  The exception is "Apache", which is somewhat more driven and excitable and while musically it doesn't rise much above the band's cleantone-guitar-goth formula, it's among the better of the pieces in that sound and Astbury's vocal is superb (it also points towards the future).  The additional studio sessions are a bit of a mixed bag-- "The Crypt" is a total disaster-- a bizarre shouted backing vocal totally mangles the piece, but both "Moya" and the other recording of "The Fatman" are vast improvements-- setting up atmosphere and mood far better then anything else on the record does, but Astbury's vocals, while definitely the highlight of the pieces, still lack confidence.		In direct opposition to all of this is the three live tracks-- they've got a more punk edge to them, overdriven, feedback soaked guitars dominate the pieces (well, as much as any guitar performance dominates these tracks) and Astbury seems to feed off the live energy, his trademark shouts and quips find their way in ("Faith").		Invariably, it's really more a curiosity than anything else-- the performances aren't horrible, it's all just a bit boring compared to both what would rise from the band's ashes and its contemporaries.
1,Much as I love Pat Metheny's music, I have to damn this recording, and firmly:  DON'T SPEND ANY MONEY ON **THIS**!!!  The only reason this dud has received any five-star reviews is because Metheny's music is so transparently wonderful that it shines when even the worst performers attempt it -- as is the case here with Metheny's Polish collaborator.  Unfortunately, her rather unremarkable voice takes away greatly from what would otherwise be a pure pleasure.		For a clue as to how Metheny's and Mays's music should be handled, listen instead to that Chicago marvel, Kurt Elling on his 2003 CD Man In The Air.  Elling has a clear facility with lyrics, as his take on Minuano amply demonstrates:  both the song and the singer simply soar.  As well they should!  I could listen to that take endlessly, just as I could the original on Still Life (Talking).  I doubt anyone would feel that way about anything on Upojenie, given a choice:  this was simply an experiment that should never have been recorded.  Experiments are well and good, and useful -- but the ones that fail should be culled immediately in favor of better work.  Nobody would miss **this** disaster if it fell off the discography ...		Seriously, check out the Kurt Elling version of Minuano.  Breathtaking!!  One can only hope that he performs and writes lyrics for more Pat Metheny tunes (perhaps Metheny will notice and propose a jam session).  In fact, THAT would be a collaboration truly *worth* hearing.
1,I purchased this CD as a gift for a friend and, long story short, I ended up with a second copy. Knowing it would be a waste of time to try to return it, I popped it open, slid it into the CD player and immediately went to track 2, "There is no Arizona", a really well done bluesy country song.	Problem, for me anyway, is that this is the only song that comes even close to my taste in country music. The rest of the CD sounds like tunes that singers with better taste (or with handlers with better taste) passed on when listening to demos.	I can only hope that the CD grows on me with repeated listenings or it will just join of pile of CDs that I should have waited for more singles to be released before I purchased them.
1,I thought this would be a lot better than it is.  Nothing even remotely resembling the Monkees music.  Don't know what else to say but it's not very good.
1,I'm a big fan of Rene Jacobs and I agree with his comments in the booklet, but this is dreadful. I listened to it 3 times but finally threw in the trash chute. None of the singers is good and the Leoporello is even worse than that, as is the Zerlina. And the recorded sound is weird to my ears. It all sounds like the singers dubbed their voices. Sorry, but having first heard Siepi as Don at the Old Met, and many others since, can't dig this. BTW I have this Naples dvd with Petri as Don and Bruscantini, Alva and Ligabue. Great fun.. 1958. Best of all, the cardboard sets are by one Franco Zeferreli!
1,From the first beat of this recording, it was not good news - the awlful sound of a drum machine, which is used on all tunes. Makes me cringe. Tells me they were too cheap to hire a live drummer, and that spells unimaginative to me. Yes, she can still sing well, and the arrangements are a little different. Then, after a few tracks in, the dreaded rap vocal effect is brought out, were her voice sounds like a computer talking (i don't know what it's called) but it's terrible to cloud such a great voice with this effect. The producer of this recording should be embarrassed.	It was a good idea, but spoiled. Maybe it will sell to those who don't mind listening to drum machines, synths, and vocal effects. I like real instruments played by pros. Like Ms. Flack's first few albums.
1,Were David Gilmour not a member of Pink Floyd, there's no way this album would still be in print after 22 years.  Gilmour's an excellent guitarist and a fine singer, but he has none of the songwriting vision of his former bandmate, Roger Waters.  It was Waters warped worldview that gave classic Pink Floyd its edge.  Gilmour's undeniable talent may have added to Floyd's sound, but on his own he has nothing much to say.  The songs on his debut album are mostly interchangeable.  They are also pleasent enough, but dissipate before they can make an impression on your frontal lobe.  That Gilmour could release an album of lumbering dinosuar rock in the midst of the punk explosion and not be ridiculed is some kind of testament.  But its no reason to indulge him these many years later.
1,nothing artistic here.		plays like a student.		pass it up...
1,Is this Dokken? I know the CD cover says it is. But, maybe it's a mistake. Because it sure doesn't sound like Dokken. This is a hairband's weak attempt at grunge. "Puppet On A String" and "Bitter Regret" are the only good tunes here. Avoid this CD like the plague.
1,I need to think before I buy another Styx album. They are not the same any more. This isn't the Styx we all love. This album was horrible. There wasn't one song that I will ever listen to again. What a waste of money,
1,Having bought into the DTS mystique, I was ready for a sonic treat when I bought this concert DVD. So many DTS DVD's were so outstanding, James Taylor's Live at the Beacon, the Eagles amazing reunion concert, Hell Freezes Over, to name just two. But this one was a disaster. First, the video production was not quite up to high school standards, but what was really appalling was the concert mix. The horns and drums drowned out the hapless Gaye who in the beginning could barely be heard. As the concert progressed, the balance got better as they gave Marvin progressively more volume, but the concert engineers obviously never heard of EQ. His voice sounded so tinny and thin, even during the best part of the concert. There seemed to be nothing wrong with his performance - he did indeed give it his all, and the band sounded pretty awesome, but the engineering was so bad that it was almost hard to listen to, especially if one is used to the quality of the BET Jazz series. It seemed to me that the DVD gave us an accurate account of the actual concert experience - the crowd was treated to amateurish sound engineering. As a historical document, for academic purposes and for the truly die-hard fans, this DVD is an OK document. But for the rest of us, already spoiled by the magic of surround-sound, DTS, and some pretty terrific titles, this will one will not impress.
1,I grew up listening to black music.  I think black music is some of the very best music ever recorded.  However, in an age when blacks and whites are learning to love and respect each other, I find this to be disturbing.
1,As you probably know, Pierre and Chuck along with 2 talented musicians founded the great Quebecer punk band Reset. Great lyrics, original guitar work (really original...not a lot of punk guitarists use tapping in their solos, plugged on a Boss Metal Zone disto pedal) and innovative melodies. Go check for everything you can find on Reset, you won't regret it.		But then...ouch, still hurts me...the ashes from Reset resulted in a one-man studio trip album called Radioactive (which is sooooo bad...Phil should have put this cd under his name, without raping the name of Reset) and this...yuk...Simple Plan band. Empty of intelligent lyrics, empty of originality...but full of superficiality...still empty of sense. Especially Pierre...dude, come on!!! You once wrote awesome lyrics about those fat industries that keep on destroying our mother Earth...pretty sad to see it all turned out to be songs about broken hearts, wanting to be perfect to you daddy's eyes...boohoo...WAKE UP!!! YOU'RE 25!!!! You should have stopped caring about it for a long time now. Ok that's it, I'm done.
1,I have always adored Rene Fleming but this album is a disgrace.  Perhaps Ms. Fleming was ill or tired when she made these recordings or maybe she was just understandably disinterested in the project but, in every selection, she sounds like a child singing in a high school play.  The pseudo-singers that accompany her are even worse.  Finally, the inept arrangements, which seem to be a demented combination of country/western and bad jazz are positively painful to hear.		My copy is already part of a landfill.
1,Every album sounds the same. The same beats and almost the same lyrics. I can sing any song over every song he has. He's not a genius. He never challenge himself. I saw the In the Closet video. Looks like an old standard Chi-town building. EVERY player in Chicago knows about the law that there has to be 2 exits out of every apartment. He wouldn't be stuck in the closet if he just went out the back door. Jeez.
1,Even the most diehard fan has to be rolling his eyes and clutching his wallet. What is the record company trying to prove?		How much they can bilk the public?		Don't walk past this cd...run!!!!!!!!
1,As happens sometimes with BGO releases, the sound quality isn't great on this set. It sounds flat when compared to the original Capricorn CD pressings from the late 90s. Fortunately, the Capricorn ones can still be found at a decent price on Amazon, at least for now. Bought this BGO pressing with thoughts of saving money. Ended up getting rid of it and buying the Capricorn ones instead. Should have done that to start with.
1,I admit, after hearing 'From A Motel 6' (on the Painful album)and 'Madeline' from this one, I was seriously anticipating getting aCD from this band.  Needless to say, since I was somewhat unfamiliar with this band (...)..I hoped that this was not one of those bands where that 'one' song would be the best one on the CD. Well unfortunately, it was.	However, I do not think that this band does not have promise. They do. I have a sense that with this band when they are hot..Ouch! when they are cold..Brrr! I would also like to say that it is quite possible that Yo La Tengo is the type of band where one album wouldn't agree with you and that another one of their's would. Hit or Miss. Geez, they have like eleven to chose from anyways, right?	So if I ever find myself with (enough money) again (She says with "bunny-ears" from her pockets), then I will take another chance on this group. Possibly with 'Painful' because it seems to have a sort of direction and mood that this album lacks.
1,There are reasons why this album never made it to the top echelon of Neil Young albums. He didn't exactly come roaring out of the gates into the 21st Century.		It's turgid, it's sluggish, it's...oh, I don't know, get out your thesaurus and come up with your own descriptor.		Even a song like "Goin' Home"...which echoes prime Neil & Crazy Horse...isn't as good as prime Neil & Crazy Horse. It makes you want to put on "Zuma" or "Ragged Glory."		The post-9/11 song "Let's Roll" is a sign of the times. "Are You Passionate" was released on April 9, 2002, almost 7 months after everything changed. It's definitely no "Ohio," but it's Neil's take on the events of 9/11.		Backing is from Booker T. Jones (organ, vibes, vocal), Duck Dunn (bass), Steve Potts (drums), Frank Sampedro (guitar and vocal), Tom Bray (trumpet), Neil's wife Pegi (vocals), and his sister Astrid (vocals).
1,This is a very strange situation for a young jazz star such as Spalding. However, the arranging and orchestration choice is poor, and there's actually not too much of jazz to listen to here.  I was very disappointed.
1,I have boycotted nashville country music now for the past 10 years. Probably  around the time mark chestnut and sammy kershaw started to fade away. I don't know what happened to country music, but it seems that Pat, who I thought was going to bring country music back, has really started to go all rascal flatts on us. If you think this album is good, try his older stuff back before nashville could get they're badonk adonk, toby keith lovin money snatchin pop genre lotion soaked hands on it. I only hope cory morrow doesn't fall into this landfill. Check these real texas singers out like randy rogers, steve earl, robert earl keen, kevin fowler, roger crager, towns van zandt, stevie ray vaughn,jack ingram, jerry jeff walker, gary p. nunn,rodney crowell, chris knight, derryl dodd, charlie robison, to name a few. I guarantee you'll like any these bands
1,I emailed a friend who was travelling in England, and she brought "Speaking..." back for me.  What a disappointment!  This collection of new songs is right down the middle of the Adult Contemporary  road, neither interesting nor groundbreaking.  Gone are the traditional  Irish tunes for which Mary Black has no equal; also missing are the  "new classics" like "Ellis Island" that have  occasionally cropped up on some of her CDs.  Save for "Turning  Away", this is a collection of rocks, not gems.  It seems as if Mary  Black is tired of being pidgeonholed as an Irish singer, so she's trying to  break into America by releasing a CD of boring music that showcases neither  her voice nor her early talents for selecting worthy material.  I can't  believe, after listening to her older CDs, that this collection of tunes is  anything more that a contractual obligation.  The Crowded House tune  "Fall At Your Feet" is almost embarrassing, and Sting's  "Fields of Gold" is nice, but not suited for her voice.  "Broken Wings" is pretty, nothing more.  If you have to have  everything Mary Black records, you might like this more than I did.  But if  your looking to hear that glorious voice, you'll tire quickly of this CD.  Mary, call me when you're in Maryland and I'll help you pick songs for the  next one!
1,Dear Frank Wildhorn:	STOP WRITING MUSIC FOR THEATRE. If I wanted to hear your music performed, I would go see a Celine Dion show. Unfortunately for her, I wouldn't pay to see her, either. Why do you insist on writing 90's power ballads and trying to slam them into a show set in another century? I highly doubt Robert Louis Stevenson was singing power ballads while he was writing this. Hunter Foster poops out better songs than you write.
1,There was a reason why they were a good 80's hair band. There's none of that here. I hate to say it but whatever it was that made them good back then - it's gone. Maybe it's the actual hair - I dunno. Even the singer doesn't really sound the same. I mean - it sounds like they got someone who sounds a lot like him and went on without him (like so many are doing these days: Journey, Styx, Foreigner - You get the idea.). If it was an unknown band and this was their first album it would be in the .99 cent bin.
1,I hate to pile on but this album was extremely disappointing. The others on here have articulated perfectly how I feel about this release. The only thing I can add is that David VIncent is bringing forth his work in Genitorturers and that is NOT a good thing. Please...go back to your roots.
1,yes, heavy and aggressive, pretty much a big "F-U" to whatever lout they've got in their sights, but it's an "F-U" from chicks you probably wouldn't worry too much about getting the kiss off from. They sound Leather Tuscadero tough, and, baby, that's not tough; it's just annoying. Jack Off Jill can shred a bit, and they at times fire up the guitars, find their hooks and almost . . . almost . . . reach something better, but Joan Jett was more fun and Courtney Love and Hole were not only more fun but much smarter than these gals. Instead of getting disappointed and pissed off at people and then writing songs about them, Jack Off Jill would be wise to just find a better class of friend. You've got to wonder, after awhile, why you keep picking losers. Attitude, ladies, can only carry you so far when you really don't stand for anything.
1,So sad that a label as promising as "neo-prog" seems capable of simply conjuring just about thirty shades of Genesis derivations instead of, I don't know, progressing structurally. Of course the only warmth I'm finding here lies in about 1/5 of a typically overlong runtime found via instrumental interludes, surrounded by a sea of progressive pop exuding that tired British geezer-martyr energy.
1,I admit I was curious what all the fuss was about, so I purchased a copy of this CD. I regret spending my hard-earned cash on it. To all the folks who love this band: Go ahead and start zinging this review with your negative votes. That's OK. I'm writing this review to warn other unsuspecting listeners who might be mislead by the praise nearly everyone else heaps on this CD.	Here is why I really dislike this CD. The music falls into two pretty distinct categories: most tracks ramble around and Mark Kozalek plays some pretty mean six-string and drones on and on about "issues" that reflect a degree of self-absorption just this side of Counting Crows. Consequently, most songs are indistinguishable from one another. (I read somewhere that this CD is largely a solo effort from Kozalek-maybe that explains some things about it.)	Whether it's Have You Forgotten or I Feel the Rain Fall, it's pretty much all the same sparse acoustic guitar, pained vocals, and angst. While I liked the track Song for a Blue Guitar, I kept thinking how much I would rather be listening to Cowboy Junkies.	Make Like Paper pulls the CD up a full star by itself and might make its way on a compilation CD. Kozalek lets loose with some guitar work that reminds me a bit of Tom Verlaine or even Chris Spedding at times. I can almost appreciate the irony of including Silly Love Songs and turning it into a dirge, but even this reworking does not inspire repeated listenings. I had hope that Kozalek might do something clever with Yes' Long Distance Runaround, but he pretty much runs it aground. The band also covers All Mixed Up from the Cars. I think that would have been a better title for this CD.	Caveat emptor.
1,Another lookalike, soundalike rapper!!  Show the muscles (coz he don't got brains) and the HUGE jewelry and grab your crotch....blah blah blah. Same ol' rap, which is short for CRAP!!		(...)
1,JUDAS came back after 7 years. The new singer is amazing: he can sing like Halford when he wants, he can be himself when he wants, he has total voice control. Guitarrist Glenn TIpton assumed control of all lyrics, and they  are good too. The trouble is: the songs just aren't good enough. The only  exception is "Cathedral Expires", which I consider a classic.
1,Hot Chocolate and who? This is about the [worst] cd I bought to date. The only song I like on this cd is "my way", but I didn't wanna spend 14 bucks for it. Fred or Freddy D whatever, performs his worst lyrics all on this one cd. And he tries to dis Trent Reznor, please, he was making music before you and he'll be here after the end of your disgraced music carrer. Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory" is 100 times better than all 3 of Limped Bizkit's cds. And at least Mike can actually rap without the ghost writers. Fred, I advise you not to rap anymore, because you Can't. No More Bizkit's Please.
1,I had such high hopes for this CD since I was unable to catch the show live at 54 Below in NYC. However, I did read the reviews and not only were there cast members from the revival, there were also cast members from the original production who performed, which would make a live recording of this event quite a collector's item and a must-have. Well, I have to say it's only a collector's item for the die hard Side Show fans (since there are only two other recordings of this wonderful show out there). At just a little over 30 minutes, I found this single CD lacking. Granted there were a few tracks that didn't make it onto the 2014 cast recording but those tracks were essentially incidental music and transitional scenes. There was another recording of "All in the Mind," which, while lovely, did not need to be recorded again as it is included in the cast recording. All in all, a really big disappointment that could have been quite amazing.
1,A total ugly piece of crap, though to be fair Dylan has done worse, and it's at least a marginal improvement over Knocked Out Loaded. The good news is that the album opens up with a decent, acceptable rocker ("Let's Stick Together"), and contains a decent Grateful Dead collaboration with nice backup vocals and crappy lead vocals ("Silvio"). The bad news is that, besides those two, there's nothing The rest is either the two trite, boring ballads ("Death is Not the End"; "When Did You Leave Heaven"; "Ninety Miles Per Hour (Down a Dead End Street)"), overproduced rock that's supposed to be loads of fun but isn't ("Sally Sue Brown", "Had a Dream About You, Baby", the unfunny goof track "Ugliest Girl in the World", with an indeed ugly riff), or two bad folk covers with gospel backup singers and lead vocals from Dylan that sound like he's a dying elephant ("Shenandoah"; "Rank Strangers to Me"). So while it totally sucks, it's not quite the bottom of Dylan's barrel, which had already happened an album beforehand. Of course, saying an album isn't as bad as Knocked Out Loaded is a pretty small compliment, especially for an artist of Dylan's stature.
1,over-hyped, little enjoyable video; already had the CD.
1,The item sold here is the unapproved 1990s-era Outlet CD, not the band-remastered version that I review which came out on Edsel in 2000. The earlier versions of Horslips on CD suffer enormously from poor sound and shoddy packaging.		That said, I rate this 2 out of 5 only by comparison with the band's finest albums, Tain, Book of Invasions, and Happy to Meet--5 stars; Tracks from the Vaults: 4; Dance Hall Sweethearts: 3; and the closest equivalent not in sound but in effect to SS/TT: the Unfortunate Cup of Tea. I am a Horslips fan, but to be honest, this album is a letdown.		Fans of Aliens and Man Who Built America would like this most. Those eager for more of a progressive folk style should stick to the earlier triumphs, for they will find almost no trace of the band's best songs and stirring concepts on SS/TT. For a band that long had suffered under Tull comparisons, this does, true, mirror the stage reached by the early 80s with Tull. But, fans of both bands generally would have to admit that this period was not the peak for either the Irish band or their English peers.		Followers of the fab five tend to mark this low; the reviews on Amazon rate it overall higher than other critics have. Yes, it does have a sparkly keyboard and sprightly guitar combo. The guitars are the most recognizable feature, the one instrument that despite genre changes by the band, still has a distinctively identifiable Horslips sound. You'd never guess if you had not been told, however, that the final studio track by Horslips here, "Soap Opera," with its synth hiss fadeout, is by the same band that began their first album with a cough and tin whistle and wheezy concertina.		So, this is the end of the line. The concept of matching lyrics to short stories, evident still from the title, seems to have been (as was the Carolan comparison for "Dance Hall") jettisoned. Two F. O'Connor stories do survive as titles and their storylines can be dimly discerned in Flannery O'C's "The Life You Save May Be Your Own" in the lyrics here, and a bit less allusively in Frank O'C's considerably grimmer than the song here's attitude, "Guests of the Nation." Guests is the standout tune on the LP; "Rescue Me," with its tender folk return to the band's roots, shines as well and stands here as a poignant reminder of the spirit that infused the band at its peak.		The other songs? Well, none reach the nadir of the opening track on Dance Hall, "This Is What You Want," although even that celtic disco fusion from '75 at least tried to be different enough to stick in your memory a bit--for better or worse. The same problems the band had mid-70s when they veered into mainstream hard rock repeat at the end of the decade. On SS/TT, the other eight songs shuffle along into MOR rock circa 1980. This final phase of the band has been labelled "new wave," but this is in the same league as when Dire Straits and Huey Lewis were marketed with that same musical category, after bar bands had cut their hair and jumped on the post-pub rock bandwagon.		None of the eight songs sink totally, and this is to the credit of the consistent vocals that had always distinguished the band's accomplished singers. The guitars do chug along with echoes of an Irish trad influence however faint, and the drums can be as thunderous as they were on previous LPs. But, the energy has dissipated. It's a brief ten songs, barely over 35 minutes, as if the effort to come up with five-a-side did the band in. Added up, the total lacks dynamics. If the band had kept at it, had taken their time to write stronger songs, and had sustained their earlier innovation, perhaps the promise of "Rescue Me" and the force of "Guests" could have sparked other and stronger songs for the rest of the LP. But, sadly, the creative flame burns low and here eight times out of ten only flickers barely above the nondescript embers.
1,........... H8ed it!!!!!!!!!!!
1,As a simple listen proves, the Airplane was at its best in the 60s, when San Francisco and psychedelia merged with the local music scene to make one momentous impact.  The Airplane was easily the most popular of several fine local bands, with a great mixture of talent among its members.  That homogeneity lasted about as long as Love Street, and when Marty Balin was ridiculed and shoved off the plane by Kantnerslick, the flight was essentially over.  Sociopolitical elements, once interwoven in the fabric of the music, now began to grow increasingly strident, and the hijackers' egos grew to alien proportions.  On the Starship, laughing at oneself was frowned upon.	It's not a worthless album - not with the likes of Kaukonen, Casady, Garcia, Crosby, etc. contributing signature licks - but it isn't a great one.  This indeed marks the end of the great albums.  Some might call it a noble failure, but there's not much noble about it.  This is, if you simply listen, just another propaganda grab at a new world order.  Kantnerslick failed here, and their subsequent efforts grew increasingly trite and irrelevant.	Check it out.  Play their albums from the beginning, and give yourself credit for recognizing the end of a great band and a great era.
1,Ok, before you click on the button that says my review was not helpful, hear me out. I like Clay. I was rooting for him every single week on American Idol. And this CD really isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. I can be a Clay fanatic and say it's wonderful and perfect but technically there's really nothing there. Every song sounds exactly the same. As I listened to the album I grew extremely bored because I felt like I was listening to one very looooooooong song. Clay is great when you listen to him in doses but song after song of the same melodies with his detached and emotionless voice just gets dull. And I hate what they did to his voice in most of the songs. You can easily tell they ran his vocals through a computer. He has a great voice. They should leave it alone. Maybe in the future when he has more control over his career, if he has a career, he can do things his way.	The weakest song on the album is "Measure of a Man." That's pure dribble.
1,I got the vibe that this album, of her pre A NEW DAY HAS COME period albums, is the safest possible corporate easy listening/adult contemporary, meaning it was packaged as the absolutely blandest and therefore widest possible/safest taste.  Which makes it very bad.  Not Nimoyian or Shatnerian BAD, just VERY bad.  To use a term from Joseph Lanza's book, ELEVATOR MUSIC (very informative and a good introduction to easy listening music), this album for the most part is aural wallpaper.  It's expertly crafted, but that, I find, is it's greatest weakness, though I want to use stronger words.  The hits, which play on a somewhat depressing or schmaltzy sentimentality, work the best on this album, hence my two stars.  I actually very much enjoy "My Heart Will Go On," but it and this whole album allude strongly to an updated take on Debby Boone's YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE album (I have no problem with Ms. Boone, and she's not what I would file as one of my legitimate joke albums, a la David Hasselhoff's "straight" rockers).  "My Heart Will Go On" is one of those bordering on terrible easy listening songs, like "You Light Up My Life," "The Impossible Dream," "My Way" (oh, PLEASE, CELINE, DO NOT COVER THAT SONG!  PEW!), "What a Wonderful World," "Wind Beneath My Wings," and "All By Myself," which are adequate to decently listenable, but ONLY by the signature artist and no. one. else.  period.  Any other version is a joke, at best camp, cover tune and should not be done.  (Oh, oh, "All By Myself" ....)  The songs for the most part run the ...and the kitchen sink gauntlet of styles, with one awful, glaring contrived accent exception, "Treat Her Like a Lady," which reaches out and strangles the listener with something strongly suggesting a pedigree going back to Robert Mitchum's Capitol CALYPSO IS LIKE SO album.
1,The first hint that this guy has little talent can be found in the enormous amount of material that he releases. Thsi guy turns out music like Jimmy Dean turns out sausages. This is hokey, bombastic, hack music. Medicine Woman? Let's pander to the goofiest New Agers, eh? I doubt that any of the reviewers who praised this album would trust their health to some backwards medicine woman instead of modern health care givers - especially when they hear that the average Native American Indian looked like an old crone by age 30 and was usually dead by 35. This junk is what gives New Age a bad name.
1,This is probably one of the most overrated albums of modern times. Tool are not bad musicians but they tend to make a mess of albums - and this is their biggest mess of their career. Of the 15 tracks only 8 are songs while the rest is senseless filler segments sandwiched in between songs.	Aenima actually starts well and the first songs show some progression from their debut. However the first filler starts on track 4 and here the album turns into an extremely difficult and frustrating experience. The other songs aren't as strong as you again struggle with more filler. Things pickup with "jimmy" and the title track before the entire album drowns in endless filler and noise.	Had Tool stuck to the no-nonsence format of their debut we may have had a good album.	Critics and fans will equate this to genious but these people are the first to be fooled by gimicks and concepts that often mask musical blandness. Many of them have a fairly limited exposure to  metal outside of the US mainstream. It may be of surprise to them that many European underground bands easily beat Tool musicaly and emotionaly. If you are interested then here is a short list:	Opeth	Paradise Lost	The Gathering	Amorphis	Anathema	Tiamat
1,As much as I bashed Knocked Out Loaded, at least it had Brownsville Girl. There's NOTHING I like about Down in the Groove. literally. I usually leave the room when the best song (Silvio) plays. To say nothing of the worst... more of thoes banal love songs (Let's Stick Together; Sally Sue Brown; When Did You Leave Heaven; Had a Dream About You, Baby) and more awful covers (most of the aforementioned plus Let's Stick Together; 90 Miles Per Hour; Shenandoah and Rank Strangers To Me) and awful attempts at humor (Ugliest Girl in the World) and philosophy (Death is Not the End). Bob's successes are spectacular, sure, but his failures are equally so. Case in point: this one.
1,Annie Lennox is a good singer, but she yells too much. And all the tracks sound the same because she over sings all of them. Most of these tracks demand a quiet approach, so songs like Strange Fruit, completely miss the mark.
1,when i heard this Album I expected more. Heather Headley can sing/Sang,but this Material here is kinda corny. this Album got Her sounding like a Lounge Oleta Adams. it's missing that snap&that One track that truly highlights her fully to me. I enjoyed hearing her vocal range,but not the dime a dozen music that kicks in for the most part of this album.there are Artists on Labels that are tax write offs,but Heather Headley ain't one of them,She deserves better.
1,Ashlee Simpson just plains sucks.		Its not that we hate her, we hate bad music and she definitely doesnt make GOOD music nor anything in the medium.		F*** an Ashlee Simpson. Shes ugly and talentless and has to lip synch like a little b!+ch
1,love nora, this is not her best selection
1,There are two types of Steve Winwood music, and individual taste will dictate whether you will like this cd or not.  If you are the Winwood fan who perfers his R&B pop sound,["Valarie", "Higher Love", "Roll With It", "Gimmie Some Lovin" etc], you are going to more than likely find this cd a total bore.  If you perfer his soothing layed back jazzy traffic feel to his music, you are probably going to find this cd enjoyable.  Having said that, after listening to this cd a few times, I find the cd to be somewhat uneventful.  Well played and sung, but nothing that is going to be memorable, or even ear catching for that matter.  Most of the music comes across as bland.  I found the best song on the cd to be "At Times We Forget", which at least grabs the listeners ear, and is the most listenable track on this collection.  "Dirty City", is another fine song, and features Eric Clapton, and predictably sounds as if it came right out of the Blind Faith era.  The rest of the songs  basically sound the same, with that jazzy slow uninspired sound.  Steve Winwood is a great talent, but sometimes I feel he goes overboard with this smooth jazz sound that I also feel takes the fire out of many of his live shows.  I do not want to sound negative, but this cd is nothing near his best work and is average at best.
1,this album has quite no musical continuity to Moodies's classical albums from late sixties and early seventies ! no song here could find its place there ...
1,I really like Trans Siberian Orchestra. I've been to a few concerts. This album never hit the mark of excellence I expect.
1,When I heared the first single "Why R U" I was full of hope. Then Amerie released all the album and... Damn, what is it?! "In Love & War" is one of the poorest r&b CD in 2009. Don't waste your time, money and especially nerves! Completely misunderstanding and decline of r&b.
1,This is the worst song... Sounds like a 7-11 ad. I can't beleive she actually put this out. Come on she can do better than this. She needs someone else to write her lyrics. Whoever's doing it now doesn't know what their doing.
1,Some of the songs listed on the ad were not on the actual CD!!!	I was cheated!!!
1,I cringed watching this. Having been to their shows in the 80's and even early 90's this is simply not the same band. Trying to pose as an alternative band while playing Motorbreath does not work, and having this gagging relationship with the crowd like some U2 concert was utterly embarrassing to watch. (I'm a fan of U2 as well but this is Metallica we're talking about. In other words Heavy Metal\thrash etc).		Some would say leave them be, they were different in the 90's they have a right to and I also have a right to not like it and personally feel they made fools of themselves way too much in those days. I have to give a tip of the hat to Jason for not putting up with this nonsense and finally doing the right thing and ditching them but that was mainly for trying to do his own thing.		They really needed the wake up call but in my opinion it's too late. They died in 1989, Cliff was the glue that kept them focused. Lars' drugs and James' drinking didn't help the production quality of Justice and after that album they (Lars) were consumed by being rockstars. To put it simply: Pretty much all downhill after Mustaine and Cliff were gone.
1,DJ Icey returns to the scene mixing his second compilation in the Essential Series.  Other DJ's releasing Essential Mixes have ranged from UK's Radio 1 Pete Tong to former Culture Club front man Boy George.  MTV's DJ Skribble has even gotten in on the act.  Icey, arguably the U.S.'s best known breakbeat DJ, lays down 20 tracks in just over 75 minutes.  This provides the listener with a wide range of music, which on the surface would appear to be a delight, but unfortunately, ends up to be the demise of the album.  The mix overall had some great cuts that got my head shaking (Orbital's Funny Break, and Meat Katie's Rotten Dot Com were my favorites), but the mix seemed too hurried.  Icey's first mix in the Essential series released last year was in my opinion, his finest work, but could have also led to my high expectations for this mix.  Having seen Icey live many times, this album does the man and his legend no justice.  Don't worry Icey, we all have our days.
1,I am firmly convinced that if all students from the first grade (even kindergarten) through their last year in  college were exposed to simple ear training exercises that allowed them the opportunity to  identify what  they were hearing on the radio, TV, CDs, jazz,  opera, orchestra, chorus, band, etc..our music scene in  general  would be much different! If simple ear training exercises, coupled with  simple music theory, were  carried out in public school, the  public would demand music of much higher calibre than they are presently  consuming. Why would they demand better music? Because they would  HEAR that the music they are  being fed is too repititious,  trite, banal to warrant our attention, much less our money on the sales of  records or concert attendance. The average person today doesn't  want to think about music, they just want  to enjoy it. They  usually will settle for the same thing day after day. They feel life is too  difficult to have to  think about the music they are listening  to. Hence the gap between the performer and the listener in the  world today. Jazz music takes a great amount of thinking. This is one of  reasons why it doesn't have a huge  following, and is why Kenny  G. should not be called a Jazz musician.
1,It seems every month metal listeners are subjected to press releases claiming that each new release is the "heaviest outing yet". It has been said for St. Anger, The System Has Failed, Christ Illusion, and even In Flames's last outing, Come Clarity. That effort while not a complete comeback was at the very least a step in the right direction. Most people would have figured that their follow-up would continue on with this sound. A Sense of Purpose was met with no press releases, no claims of past glory, not even a whisper of promotion. When a majority of the band's fans bickered more about the album artwork than anything the band could release musically. Maybe that is because the artwork is the only thing worth arguing about...		A Sense of Purpose is exactly what In Flames is missing. I have been one of the devout that has backed up the band even in the darkest of times. I kept pushing the line back when it came to defending this band.  I'm afraid "A Sense of Purpose" is where I draw the line. This album isn't a sellout. The band didn't write a St. Anger. The band just frankly sounds tired. Songs like "Alias" and "Disconnected" are a jumbled mess with sloppy riffs and sloppy drumming. Anders has never sounded worse. His lyrics have hit an all time low with songs like Disconnected boasting, "I feel like sh** but at least I feel something." The band doesn't have to write about astronomy anymore, but they could at least write something that isn't cringeworthy. The opening five tracks sound identical from one another (excluding Alias).  I always appreciated the band's sense of writing catchy songs. Even if people hated Reroute to Remain and Soundtrack..., one has to admit that there are truly catchy and memorable hooks. Here, there is nothing to grasp onto. It is only after the horribly arranged "The Chosen Pessimist", the band starts to revive itself with some of the album's better songs.		"Sober and Irrelevent" kicks the latter half *and better!* of the album. If you own the Japanese edition, you are even treated with b-sides that outclass the opening five tracks on the album. There really isn't much else that can be said for these Swedes. They've had a great run with a wide variety of sounds and styles. I will always listen to In Flames for their great sense of melody and catchy songwriting. Unfortunately, there are simply bands that do it better now. Age has nothing to do with desire. Look at Dark Tranquility, they continue to perservere and release quality metal albums.
1,Most acts will price such a box set at roughly half of the price of what Sting is asking for here.  This will severely limit who buy this item, strictly the wealthly/upper end will buy this.  If this was priced more reasonably than the sales would have been lot better for it.
1,Nelly shows us his magic on this release: write absolute jibberish, organize it with horrible computerized beats, sell out and make cash by the truckload...	I'm still yet to understand as to why hiphop has gone in such a pathetic direction lately.  MCs used to rap for respect and love and in the early 90s a branch broke off forming rap about "topicless subjects" , "drugs" , "gangsta / thug" , "money flashing / jewerly" , and "jiggy/ mainstream"...Nelly showcases mostly in the topicless subject/ jiggy mainstream area...	Even worse Nelly had the nerve to diss Common during an interview.  He stated something like "oh i don't need to rhyme about topics in my songs, i don't have to go on a level and put extra thought into something that has nothing to deal with rap music like Common or someone" he stated harshly...  and to make matters even worse Country Grammar is nominated for best rap album grammy while Like Water For Chocolate (Common) isn't and Com's CD is actually of 6-7 star rating for amazon...	with lyrics like "eehh ahh  uh oh..shimmy ya"  it seems Nelly is a crossbreed of illiterate and teletubby MC... "Country Grammar", "EI" , practically the whole entire release showcase that...however on "Luven Me" Nelly actually has LYRICS sorta except he gets lost in his own barage of words after the first verse...	So all in all -- this cd doesn't deserve even 1 star -- Nelly shows us his preschool IQ -- and for those who are lost in hiphop and are on the quest to hear talented artists : check out Common, The Roots, Talib Kweli, Pharoahe Monch, Gangstarr, Hieroglyphics, etc... those are the cats who still and always will keep it real and they contribute a braincell to their work...
1,First off, let me just say it could have been anyone, but no, it was me who bought this, this chingy s**t, and wasted 13 bucks on a generic nelly wannabe with half the talent and twice the filler. kids, don't let this happen to you, just say no to whack MC's like chingy.
1,Todays mainstream pop is the absolute worst type of music avaible. I don't even know why I said its the worst type of music since I really don't consider it music. What I DO consider it though is garbage and overrated trash. I mean, these songs are not even deep or anything! This cd is for the idiots who buy every cd they hear on the radio. I hate you people who support this type of garbage. I mean, music is supposed to be an art form. How are these lame songs supposed to be considered art? They are killing the music industry for crying out loud! Not only are their lame pop songs on here, but more mainstream garbage from two other genres, rock and rap. These are the absolute worst rock and rap songs avaible. And all the stupid new rappers now a days are dumb mainstream idiots with cds that have lyrics as deep as 'Chillin' at tha holidae inn'. Yet every idiot who bought this cd probably buys that kinda garbage too. I wish you idiots would hear Del The Funky Homosapien. He is a good rapper whos cds will unfortuantly not sell better than a idiot named CHINGY. I hate him! This might be the worst cd of the year. I hate pop and mainstream rap and rock. Buy this if you like bad music. And buy Britney's new album to go along with it, you idiot!
1,Couldn't bear listening to much on this disc, and I felt like stopping the CD near the beginning of Mantra #3 (which is track #3 out of 15 tracks), but forced myself to listen to the end.  What I hear 90% of the time is tawdry and uninspired.  A previous reviewer is, in my view, correct about the chanting (in Mantra #2):  It seems to go on and on and completely fails to move this listener.  The same can be said of the concerto for soprano and orchestra;  one yearns for Gliere's greater mastery in his handling of this medium.		The music improves with the last two items.  The Apotheosis, essentally a violin concerto, has some nice moments.  And the Mirage, a symphonic poem,  aims high, in the manner of Bantock or Bax, but ultimately fails to maintain any consistency of worthy musical ideas, or inspiration.  Again, ultimately disappointing.		As mentioned by several previous reviewers, the appearance of experimental compositional techniques in several of these works is certainly admirable, but needs to be couched in music that inspires.  Unfortunately, most of the time this doesn't.  After this first hearing, it now doesn't surprise me here at least that Foulds' music has not taken hold with either public or performers.  In my view, it doesn't stand comparison to British contemporaries such as Cyril Scott, York Bowen, Bax, Bantock, and even Sorabji, where the music at least moves the listener.  I love discovering the music of composers unknown to me, but I'm sad to say that Foulds is not one I will be adding to my CD acquistion library.		I had read all of the previous reviews here, and was struck by the wide divergence of opinion, either hating it or loving it, no middle ground.  I was hoping to be optimistic, wanting to add another neglected master composer to my already large CD library.  But I have to say, I hated the Mantras and the concerto for voice, and found the last two items second rate musically but at least pleasant to listen to.		My advice:  Don't waste your money on this CD.		Buy up all the Bax Chandos CDs instead, plus the Cyril Scott Dutton and Chandos CDs, and (when it comes out in 2007) the Bantock "Omar Khayyam" on Chandos together with the other Bantock CDs on the Hyperion, Chandos and Dutton labels.
1,Oh please, 5 stars???? People wake up! This is not music; in fact I don't know what the heck it is! Janet could have and should have done better...She probably would have done better had she LISTENED to her "Rhythm Nation" and "Control" albums again for some musical inspiration. It's evident by "Damita Jo" that Janet has run out of fresh, generative ideas when it comes to music and instead resorts to shock value to sell cds. The lyrics here are disguisting, not sexy at all...not by a long shot. I don't know how she made it through the recording sessions without falling asleep; where are the innovative beats, the funky grooves that made Janet so unique in the early days? Perhaps the only redemptive song is "R&B Junkie", but that's messed up by Janet's wanting "to get her freak on"...does every song need to reference sex? Mmmm...not really. I am terribly disappointed b/c Janet is supposed to be the Queen of pop, but she has resorted to trying to "fit in".	To all of the people who gave this album 5 stars, you should have nothing to say about Britney Spears' raunchiness or Christina Aguilera's obvious dislike of clothes without throwing Janet's name in as well; this is not musical expression, it's garbage.	Pick up Tamia's latest, "More". You won't be disappointed. Make the wise decision as a consumer to support artists who have true talent and the common sense to display it in a tasteful manner.	Oh yeah, Janet, please GIVE UP THE BALLADS. Your voice is just not strong enough...It's tough enough to listen to one, but a whole album full of them? Get real. Stick to what you do best, or better yet, what you did the best back in the day...and that was bringing the funk to pop music in a unique way. To whom much is given, much is required. It can not be argued that Janet has natural talent, but she's channeling it in the wrong way. This cd falls way short of her potential and it's pretty sad to watch someone as great as Janet sell herself short. Janet, give up the raunchy act, you're so much better than that. If this is the "real" Janet Damita Jo Jackson, I'll pass and you should too.
1,I'm an open minded music listener, but I just can't stand listening to this sh*t. It makes me feel like I'm going to die every time I listen to them. The music is awful and annoying. The vocalist sounds like he has got his balls cut and the rest of the band just don't got any talent at all. My friends and ppl around me always play this crappy music and claimed that, Simple Plan is what punk rock is and "Welcome To My Life" is punk rock masterpiece (holy sh*t!!!). These guys are just a bunch of posers who had poluted the music world with their whinny music. They don't deserve the word 'punk' and isn't a rock band at all. Simple Plan sucks!!!
1,Entwine-diEversity		1		By: Clifford Newsted		Seems like since Century Media began to sell a few records with Lacuna Coil all sorts of bands that mesh their goth and metal influences have been popping up in record bins in North America. You've seen this happen in all the genres in the last 20 years, most of the better or higher quality bands have surfaced and are the blue print for the c company versions.		Entwine is just such a band, they are recycling all that has come before them. They should have listed in the liners the band that they haven't ripped off from the last 4-5 years. It's amazing, I hear stuff on diEversity that I have heard on HIM, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and Therion records! And what's up with the title of the record? Looks like something Prince would have come up with?! 1988 called and it wants that title back!!! Whether or not Prince had a hand in helping with the title, his career is done just like Entiwne's.
1,This record has the foundation of good music, but lacks good hooks, melodies, transitions and quality production.  The tracks sound like demos and are intentionally minimalist with cacophonous guitar solos.  The musicianship is quite limited on this record.  On 3 or 4 tracks, it seems like the band made a wager as to whether they could write a song with just 2 chords and get away with it.  Ga, Ga, Ga, the follow-up to this record, on the other hand, is great.  There are several songs on Gimme Fiction that are analogous to songs on Ga Ga Ga, but there is nothing to compare to the writing, musicianship, melodies, hooks and production quality that the latter record has.  There is nothing on Gimme Fiction that matches the quality of tracks like "Cherry Bomb", "Don't You Evah", or any other track on that record.		I, for one, cannot understand why so many people on this site rave about Gimme Fiction.  There are much better records out there.		After the reading the liner notes to Gimme Fiction, I understand why I was underwhelmed.  Most of the music on Gimme Fiction was performed by Britt Michaels whereas Ga Ga Ga has a full band behind it.  That alone explains much of the difference between the two records.
1,Only 1 track truly ministers to me but Pastor Winans is a true worshipper - it just didn't work for me this time. God bless you on the next project.
1,Im a huge fan of take this to your grave so when I was in the record store I figured this is probably pretty decent too. Not so, its like listening to an entirely different band. Its like nails on chalkboard to the ears when you compare it to take this to your grave, unbearable. Check out their newest EP if you want to add a fall out boy cd to your collection.
1,These remixes are absolutely horrible!!! They do no justice to the original song.  They don't even deserve one star but you have to give one or the review won't go through.  Zero stars.
1,I love the songs, except that the first 2 tracks skip and can't hear songs.
1,While this album has a few really strong songs (i.e. "I Know You," "Wishing Well," "Murder for the Money") the majority of the songs on this record are not so great.  I am a huge Morphine fan and probably saw them play live at least 20 times.  My biggest beef with "Like Swimming" is that it contains many songs that they had played live for YEARS and which never made it onto their previous albums.  Mark Sandman even made fun of a few of these songs ("11 O'Clock," "Empty Box," "French Fries With Pepper") in his onstage intros...perhaps because of their painfully bad lyrics.  The overwrought production SCREAMS "We are on a 'Major Label' now" and seems to strongly contradict the "lo-fi" sound they so carefully cultivated on their first three albums.  Drum loops and samples, long meandering intros, badly-chorused backing vocals, really cheezy synths...All these studio tricks seem to be an attempt to cover up a bunch of half-songs.		While I don't loathe this album the way many of my fellow Morphine fans do (trust me...they are out there...they just don't post reviews on Amazon), "Like Swimming" is the staggering disappointment in their catalog simply because there is plenty of evidence that Morphine were capable of so much more with every other album they released.
1,In my Anton Bruckner Memorial Aviary, there is a lustrous bird which parades its plumage to the wonderment of all - let's call it Georg. It is full of drama. Its birdsong registers loud and clear. Few doubt its nobility.  Other birds come and go and some of them end up in my soup but Georg is relatively safe and stays on his perch. Why so?		All feathers - no meat.		Other than a crass Third and a porridge-like Sixth, Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra have much to offer at first glance: drama is on tap; the recording is excellent; the CSO may not be as idiomatic as the Berlin or Vienna Philharmonic but they play superlatively; only Bruckner could pen a Symphony No. Zero and it is thrillingly played here (and much the same could be said of the unproblematic First); Solti is neither a fusspot nor impatient in this domain and commendably so. So what is there not to like?		The Hotspur Principle states that anyone can stand on the edge of the deep and summon the spirits - but will they come? Their presence is mandatory in Bruckner.		Solti was no shaman. This set is devoid of metaphysics. There is nothing inexplicable to it. For all its dramaturgy, the Ninth does not cross the River Styx into the Underworld; the holy aspiration that lies at the heart of the Eighth: "O to be delivered from the rational into the realm of pure song / My face on fire, close to the points of a star," is unconsummated here - and one can only marvel at the orchestral response for so long until tedium sets in. Consider the coda of first movement of the Seventh. It is a touchstone in any Bruckner cycle. When played cosmically, it echoes Roethke: "To what more vast permission have I come?" There is no sense here of a hull-breach in the ordinances that govern the universe - it's merely an auditable array of well-shaped quavers, crotchets and minims. That's the epitaph for the wider cycle.		Solti has more surface tension than Maazel in his recent survey but it's an open question as to which cycle is more earthbound on the tarmac (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bruckner-10-Symphonies/dp/B00475E136/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bruckner: 10 Symphonies</a>). My money is on Lorin, the kisser of concrete. Herbie is still sovereign&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bruckner-9-Symphonies-Box-Set/dp/B001DCQI8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bruckner: 9 Symphonies [Box Set</a>].		Rumour has it that Patrick Henry was a Brucknerian before his time. In an address to the Virginia Convention, he thundered:		"Give me mysticism or give me feathers!"		Here, the latter is forthcoming.
1,A couple killer mid-80's singles and a whole lotta crap...		When I was a 9 and 10 year old kid, in 1985 and 1986, I remember the first two singles from this album ("We Built This City" and "Sara") being all over radio and MTV. In my opinion, both of those songs are still killer mid-80's pop songs. The third single, "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter Tonight" (which is also the third song on the album) is also a pretty good mid-80's pop song.		Basically, that is what this album is - pre-fabricated radio-friendly mid-80's pop.  If you like 80's pop music, and if (like me) you are nostalgic for a time in your life when things were sooooo much simpler, and if that time happened to be 1985-1986, then you are probably going to like the first three songs on this album.		However, there is no coincidence that the first three songs on this album were the three singles pulled from it, because this thing goes downhill (fast) starting with track 4 ("Rock Myself to Sleep" which is an odd ditty, annoying and headache-inducing). "Rock Myself" is also Grace Slick's time to shine on this album, and she takes herself about as far away from "White Rabbit" as that kid from "A Christmas Story" did when he made a porno.		Truth be told, you can get the three singles on this album elsewhere on one of the many Starship "hits" compilations (which is sure to include Starship's other #1 80's schlock-fest - "Nothing Gonna's Stop Us Now" from the even less-memorable 1987 effort "No Protection").		The long and short is, I actually own this CD (and a vinyl copy as well), and I like the first three songs on this CD (esp. "Sara") and even I can't think of a reason to recommend that you buy this CD.  There just isn't any reason outside of 1985/1986 to buy this thing. There are no lyrics, the cover sucks and the mastering job is typical mid-80's low bass high treble tinny-sounding fare.		If you are so inclined, get a Starship "Hits" compilation instead....
1,I suppose the proper way to start this review, is disclosing my status with PT. I first learned of Steve Wilson through my love for Opeth. When I learned that he was some of the brains behind a few great Opeth albums... I figured I would give PT a chance. At first I thought they had a pretty silly name, and didn't expect much. In-Absentia was where I started, and I though it was okay. I really didn't fully jump on board until FOABP. I thought FOABP was a much more focused effort. I would say it is still the only PT album, that I can listen from start to finish. I recently got a hold of Nil Recurring. Right away the songs grabbed me. Needless to say, I was pretty excited when I heard The Incident was coming out.		I didn't waste any time in getting a copy to see what genius Mr. Steve Wilson would grace us with. I was immediatly excited when I listened to "the blind house". Very nice! "I am in for a treat with this new one" is what I thought. And then I listened to "great expectations" which was ironic, because that is how "the blind house" left me feeling. Unfortunately my great expectations were being crushed slowly with that very dull track. I soon found myself wanting to skip to the next song. Unfortunatly the rest of the album, I followed that same trend. I was greatly disappointed to say the least. I then told myself, "just keep listening, it will click eventually, maybe it's a grower". Well, a dozen spins in my stereo, and I am still not enjoying too much about this record. Honestly it's boring! The heavier, more exciting parts mostly do not work. Is Steve Wilson rapping in one of these tracks? Ok, then... I can respect trying something different, but some of this comes accross as trying too hard.		In the end, this release has some good moments. Who would expect anything less? I really feel like this album is too scattered. The short little filler songs seem un-inspired, and break up the bigger picture of things. I am still trying to figure out how all of the first disc is supposed to be one long song? It doesn't seem to flow that well. Maybe im missing something. Im sure a good amount of PT fanboys will like this regardless... especially after reading some of these reviews. Unfortunately I am going to hold my breath for a better follow-up.		*UPDATE: After reading some comments, I thought I should clarify... This album is great! It's my taste in music thats lacking. lol!
1,Saying this is the best Savoy Brown release in a number of years is not really saying a whole heck of a lot.  True Simmonds can play a mean guitar, but so can dozens of other blues artists.  What really bothers me about this disc is the weak vocals from Simmonds; and the musicians for hire approach.  Just call this a Kim Simmonds solo album and I'll maybe add another star.  This is just straight ahead, workmanlike, "whiteboy" blues in the tradition (or re-tread-ition) of John Mayall;  however Simmonds is no Clapton, Green, or Taylor.  I've listened to the disc a few times  and the repeated listenings have done nothing to change my opinion.  Now it's headed for auction on eBay.	Unlike my vinyl copies of "Blue Matter" & "Raw Sienna" which I sleep with under my pillow.  "Lonesome Dave" rest in peace.
1,I only listened to the 30 seconds for review, and thanks heavens I did not purchase this item. It's time for Eric to close shop, and find a new hobby to pass the time.
1,One would hope that Chick on his trio tracks would incorporate more melody into his performances. Instead he plays them just as vaguely as Bud did, only hinting at the melodies contained in The Bud Powell Real Book e.g. Dusk in Sandi and couple of others. The trumpet and alto player play like school kids just warming up on the combo pieces. Josh Redman gives a go at  I'll Keep Loving You but I would call for a retake. This best tribute paid to Bud was not to include Time Waits among the performances.
1,The lyrics are a typical whine whine whine that is enhanced by the singer acting like he has something beyond a superficial knowledge of the world.  The result is a young person who watches blurbs of news clips and has listened to his crazy aunt about how bad and terrible America is.  Don't profess to know about war unless you have served, and the same goes with politics.  The singer has done neither, now of course he has the freedom to express his opinion because he is free, yet when all he does is smack talk about how we are not free and the flag means nothing then it is rather hypocritical.  Do you even know how young this country is young man?  The rest of the world that you speak of that is in a shystorm was there long before this country was founded.  If you hate this country so much, you can leave at any time.  Feel solace knowing that, because people in other parts of the world like Africa or the Soviet Union, do not have it so easy and would give anything to have the freedoms you have...the freedoms you so obviously misunderstand as you stoop over the zombies on your little soapbox.  Musically this band is very, very good and I can take a couple of tripe songs, but when the entire album seems to be this singer jumping on the pain train to moan and wail a hyperbole of emotional nonsense, it gets old.  I am throwing my copy in the garbage.		When you write a song, write about something you know because when you don't, you come off as nothing more than a cartoon of smokey wisps and buzzing sounds.
1,I'm a huge Tom Petty fan.  I have every one of his CD's and have seen him LIVE at least 10 times.  However, this is the first DVD-Audio (actually Blu-ray audio) that I've bought of his and only my second DVD-A period, as I mostly have SACD's for HQ sound to play in my Oppo disc player.  I was not that impressed, truly.  I listened to the whole DVD on the DTS 5.1 setting and it definitely played through all 6 speakers.  So it's a unique take on the album and is definitely in surround sound (which I usually dig).  Yes it was kind of cool hearing some of the piano behind me, yes it was cool hearing some other instruments in surround sound, but it really did NOT blow me away like so many other 5.1 multi-channel surround sound SACD's have in the past.  I have buyer's remorse and believe listening to a regular CD of Damn the Torpedoes or a high quality feed (like MOG) is basically just as good sound quality.  I returned this to Amazon (opened) and they only gave me $12 back.  I won't be doing that again...  could've easily sold it on E B A Y for $20+.
1,I do like Destiny's Child, but this album is soooooo bad. There is not a single feeling here that evokes anything from the Holiday times. Instead we have Beyonce taking over everything (as usual) lame modernizations of old,simple classics. Their harmonies are also very poor. I'm sorry, bur aren't good harmonies key for making a Christmas album mesh. If you want a good Christmas cd, get Christna Aguilera's "My Kind Of Christmas".
1,I don't like it I rarely listen to it waste of money don't buy unelse you are a die hard nicki fan
1,There are two very good reasons not to bother with this CD:		1. The outstanding performances of Handel's Italian (Arcadian, pastoral, etc.) cantatas by the ensemble La Risonanza, currently being released and up to volume 4, which obviate the need for a CD of excerpted duets.		2. The singing, which ranges from okay to hideous. Emmanuelle Haim seems to be on her own voyage of discovery, or rather rediscovery, of how to sing Baroque music in the "Can Bellow" style of the 1950s! Some of the singers on this CD simply shouldn't venture earlier than Donizetti. Some of them - in fact the majority - should know better than to cooperate with such nonsense - wide and constant vibratos, forced tempi, strained voices, ham-handed keyboard accompaniment. Haim is a total mystery, unless we assume some special affliction of musical bi-polarity.
1,Japan gets this cd a half year ago.  The United States ( the country Paul was born and raised in)  gets the cd 6 months later.  One killer song (I Can Destroy)  and the rest are mediocre.  No wonder no record companies wanted to release this in the USA. I hope Paul isn't washed up now.  Theres 2 other guitarists on these songs too,  has it gotten to that point where Paul has to have other guys play?
1,SST never paid royalties to any members ever. Odd for an iconic punk label, with Black Flag that they would never turn a "profit." Gregg owes all members a lot of cash that they'll never see.
1,I am no newcomer to Elton John. I have been a fan since 1973. I own all of Elton's music and consider myself a loyal fan. Elton is the only artist whose music I will buy without hearing it first.		Having said this, I have to say Peachtree Road is a major disappointment. Elton's previous album, Songs From the West Coast, quickly became one of my favorite albums after only a few listens. Peachtree has only one song, "Too Many Tears," that really stands out. There are some truly bad songs like "They Call Her the Cat" and "Freaks in Love." The lyrics don't rhyme in many cases (e.g. night/life, life/price, eyes/cried, car/heart, be/believe, cat/fact) and many of the lyrics are just dumb or inscrutable ("dumb as a wall"). I know Bernie Taupin bears responsibility for the lyrics, but I'm sure Elton holds veto power.		None of the tunes are particularly catchy or memorable. Elton has said on his website that he wrote the music in a span of two weeks. He should have taken longer. In many cases the background vocals are overblown ("I Stop and I Breath"), burying what many Elton John fans want to hear, the piano.		As much as Elton wants to be a gospel singer, he just doesn't have the voice for it. It doesn't matter if he's backed by a full gospel choir, he usually can't pull off gospel and this album has a couple of examples ("Answer in the Sky" and "Porch Swing in Tupelo"). If you want good Elton gospel, "If the River Can Bend" from The Big Picture is about his best recent effort.		Elton has been able to pull off country songs in the past ("Take Me Back" from 21 at 33, "Texan Love Song" from Don't Shoot Me, and all of Tumbleweed Connection) but his heart and the songwriting aren't in the country efforts on Peachtree Road.		The cover photo is as uninspired as the music.		My main problem with this album is that Elton and Bernie don't seem to have anything new to say/sing. After 42 albums, that's understandable. But Elton shouldn't feel the "Weight of the World" to put out new material if there's nothing new to give his fans. We have a great catalog to draw from. If Elton never recorded another song, he would still remain a favorite of millions. I'm sorry Elton and Bernie didn't learn from all the accolades that Songs From the West Coast received: fans want stripped down production with lots of piano and memorable songs/lyrics. If we wanted overproduced pap we'd be Britney Spears and Celine Dion fans.		So, I do not recommend Peachtree Road to casual Elton John fans, or even to faithful EJ fans. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Honky Chateau, Too Low For Zero, Songs From the West Coast, Sleeping With Past, Blue Moves, Captain Fantastic, Don't Shoot Me . . , Made in England, The Fox, and Tumbleweed Connection are all better bets.
1,God, Nirvana have to be the most overrated band in existence. People obsess over Nirvana, but stop yourselves and think, aside from alright songwriting skills, what talent did Kurt Cobain really have? he couldn't play guitar, my friend has played guitar for 6 months and can play almost every Nirvana song flawlessly. The riffs are simple and extremely repetitive, along with most of his lyrics, and he sounds like a dying camel when he sings. As for the other members- Dave Grohl is not a terrible drummer, but hes not great either, hes average at best. As for Novoselic, his bass lines are inaudible until Kurt starts whacking his guitar and screaming, and the song settles down again when hes done.		The only reason Nirvana was revolutionary was because they were different. Metal and pop dominated the Tv and radio, which Kurt, unlike anybody else at the time, actively disliked. So, he formed a talentless band and practically revolutionized, if not created, grunge. The only reason so many people like Nirvana is because they haven't heard of any of the other Seattle grunge bands, almost all of which are more talented than Nirvana. So Nirvana comes along, and all of a sudden it sucks to be a teenager and we need to throw away our hairspray and spandex and wear crappy flannel shirts and be depressed.		In my opinion, Kurt killed himself because he soon realized what he had done. After Nirvana started a revolution in crappy music, hundreds of other bands were able to get record deals because they knew thats what the public wanted now, hence the birth of Green Day and pop punk. Green Day released Dookie, and soon hundreds of kids got interested in "punk" because they believed that was what punk was- catchy hooks and simple guitar riffs. Once Green Day got going, music was never the same again. The only metal still alive is classic metal bands making comebacks (Megadeth, Iron Maiden) and new underground VERY talented foreign metal bands (Children of Bodom, In Flames). I believe if Kurt was still alive, even he would be crying because of what he had done to music. no longer do we have fun metal around, we have rap and terrible pop. thanks Nirvana. thanks alot.		If you're debating whether to get this album, dont. by doing this you support a talentless revolution and instead of rebelling against todays music, you are simply buying right into what started it. Its a sad world in music right now, but at least we can live off the underground bands.		As for the album itself: Smells Like Teen Spirit is the only alright song, as it has an infectius guitar riff, but Kurts crappy vocals muddle it. the rest of the songs have crappy simple and repetitive guitar riffs and sound like complete sh*t. not worth a dollar, but i was dumb enough to buy it.
1,I bought this cd at Best Buy today out of impulse. I love Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, Surfacing, Afterglow, etc... so I thought some awesome club mixes of some of her songs would be awesome... Well... not exactly.		There is not one standout track on this compilation.		Save your money and just buy her studio and live albums. A great artist but these remixes are far from enjoyable.
1,How many other words can describe this album, and in fact, every Iron Maiden album since 1995, with the possible exception of Brave New World?  Iron Maiden has now made the same album five times in a row, a dense, plodding 70+ minute record of "songs" that chug on mindlessly for eight minutes.  There is no cohesion to the songs, no real purpose in mind, other than to fill the album up with noise.  The album almost entirely lacks memorable riffs, solos, and lyrics. This may actually be the first Maiden album to date that lacks even one truly great song; even Virtual XI had The Clansman.  This album has nada, yet will undoubtedly get an average 4 or 5-star rating on here from the undiscriminating, tasteless Iron Maiden sheep, of which there are many.		With the exception of the first two tracks and The Alchemist, which sounds like a remake of Public Enema Number One and one of the band's worst songs in recent memory, nearly every song on The Final Frontier starts off with a one to two-minute soft opening with Bruce mumbling.  It then goes into the chugging verse, a chorus, and a long instrumental section.  It then goes back into a verse and a chorus, and ends with a repeat of the soft intro.  Completely predictable and routine, just like A Matter of Life and Death.  The album's best song is The Talisman, which at least has a good chorus and decent rhthym, even though it's a rehash of Lord of Light.  Most of the other songs aren't worth getting into, although the title track is at least halfway acceptable.		Doesn't Steve Harris realize that if a record isn't properly mixed and mastered that it makes the music tough to listen to and get into?  Thank God he didn't have as much control over the 80s Maiden albums, which were produced by Martin Birch.  Iron Maiden today is in serious need of a producer who will direct them and hone their skills and make albums that are memorable and fun to listen to.  For a band with three guitarists to create an album this bland and uninspired is inexcusable.  When 75% of the album sounds exactly alike you know there's a serious lack of direction in the band.  Iron Maiden needs to do what Judas Priest did in 1990 and make its own Painkiller, an album of fast, catchy, powerful rockers.  Ater fifteen years of the same boring rubbish it's time for a return to what originally worked.
1,To be clear, I am a huge Supremes fan and collector.  Their legacy in American pop music is unmatched.  However, in the canon of their work, the collection of music here--except for the hits and half a handful of other nice tunes--is a low point.  For one thing, the group concept had been shattered at least 3 years prior; thus, there is no notable contribution from the other 2 group members [founding member Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard's replacement, Cindy Birdsong].  Sorry, but, in a vocal group, even one where the "star" has been singled out, I still expect the "other" group members to have the opportunity to contribute something of value.  By this point, in many, many cases, the remaining Supremes were replaced by Motown session singers on recordings.  Insulting to the group talent, and unfair to the consumer, and especially the fan.  Next, Diana's voice sounds thin and tired on some of the non-hit Motown tunes, and uninspired on most of the covers.  Thirdly, the group no longer had the attention of one ace songwriting and production team like Holland-Dozier- Holland.  Additionally, there is no concept to tie these albums together.		Since you can find the hits on various compilations, you could easily skip this set unless you are a completist.  Overall, not very satisfying.
1,I have a theory about this album, the first bad disc U2 ever put out. With The Joshua Tree, U2 suddenly had the ear of the world. So what did they do? They pushed their political agenda. And while I agree with Bono's points about poverty in Africa (which needs to be fixed), televangelism, and how amazing Martin Luther King, Jr. was, Bono makes a total fool out of himself on this album by presenting his opinion in the most didactic, in-your-face way. What's the dumbest quote on the live portion of the album? Well, there are several, including the infamous "Am I buggin' ya? I don't mean to bug ya. Edge, play the blues!", from the uninteresting protest "Silver and Gold", which is followed by a guitar solo that has as much to do with the blues as Beethoven's Ninth, to that laughable switched lyric from "All Along the Watchtower", "All I've got is a red guitar, three chords, and the truth". Yeah. It's far too obvious to beat up on the live tracks, which also contain a poor cover of "Helter Skelter" ("This is a song that Charles Manson stole from the Beatles... AND NOW WE'RE STEALING IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"), so I just won't. Suffice it to say that they're all, without a single exception, really, really bad.	But hey, all that's all right, because the studio tracks are gonna save the day, right? WRONG! Okay, not entirely wrong. There are some really good songs on the studio side. Five, to be exact. First off, maybe it's because I like B.B. King more than most U2 fans, but I see nothing wrong with "When Love Comes to Town", other than the weirdness of the B.B.-Bono matchup. There are a few others, too: "Desire" is a blast, with a fun Bo Diddley beat and a horn section. "All I Want Is You" and "Angel of Harlem" are good songs too, and I love "Hawkmoon 269". And... that's it for the good stuff.	Now, onto... well, the rest. "God, pt. 2" is one of U2's most embarrassing songs. It's a trip-hop continuation of John Lennon's fantastic "God", but here it's just Bono ripping on the most trivial people he could pull out of the hat Edge wore on the cover of The Joshua Tree. Much as I like Dylan, he doesn't sound all that good on "Love Rescue Me", which he features on. They make the mistake of letting the Edge "Van Dieman's Land", and it turns out he's not a good singer at all.  And "Heartland" is a bland Joshua Tree outtake.	This, right here, is a classic example of what fame can do to a good band. I don't really like the direction U2 shifted towards in the '90s, so I see this as kind of the beginning of the end (at least until they were reborn with All That You Can't Leave Behind) for U2. A very bad, very unfocused, very confusing album.
1,It was TP-2.com where R. Kelly eagerly tried to revive the "12 Play" days. The outcome: A cheap remake of his classic 93' release and his double-effort "R.".		4 years later Kelly again (in my opinion) goes too far by producing an entire album dedicated to various remake-versions of "Step in the name of love" off his chocolate factory release. Don't get me wrong, I like R. (and "Step in the name of love" is a bangin song), but this goes too far. If you want to listen to R. at his prime check out "12 Play", "R.Kelly (his best)" "R." and then maybe "The Chocolate Factory", but avoid this.
1,My title sums up my opinion.  If you already know and love this album and you have the standard, US domestic cd, you should really seek out the version made in Europe.  I don't know how Elektra ruined the master but the US cd sounds like an MP3 with a  heavy compression ratio when compared with the sound of the European version.  (Other US WEA pop cd's from European acts from around this period were similarly poorly mastered in the US.)	However, I can't much recommend this album to anyone but the biggest HoJo fan, and maybe even not to some of them.  How a man who just a few years earlier was singing about not being brought down by the "doom crew" could end up writing such a thoroughly depressing album is beyond me.  Some of these sad songs are enjoyable and some are embarrassing ("The Voices Are Back" has to be one of HoJo's worst ever) but taken as a whole this album just wears on the listener.	I don't know whether HoJo lost his major label affiliation or he decided he no longer wanted to be involved in big, corporate music.  Either way, this album clearly signaled the change in Howard toward targeting a smaller audience.
1,What should have been Ms. Lynns finest recording is instead, a sonic disaster.  Beautiful music and stunning, heart felt vocals are grossly overwhelmed by loud, annoying, non-musical rumblings of BOOM...THUMP THUMP... BOOM, not unlike the noise you'll hear from motor vehicles driven by youngsters. Except for the final track, How Can I Be Sure, I find this recording mostly unlistenable.
1,The Bad Plus has been lavished with so much praise that's it's near impossible to point out the considerable flaws of "Suspicious Activity?" without looking like a jerk. Perhaps I've been spoiled by being exposed to such stalwarts like Art Blakey, Hank Mobley, Thelonious Monk, and Freddie Hubbard, but I just don't think this trio of relative upstarts can ultimately measure up to the genius of their jazz elders. Don't get me wrong: I liked "These Are the Vistas" and even the slightly underwhelming "Give." But the 2005 followup makes me wonder if the band's hype is totally justified. Throughout this copy-protected, not-iTunes-friendly CD, you'll find lots of posturing but little in the way of substance, clarity, or vision. A few of the performances lack cohesion and frankly sound a bit cluttered; it's as if Reid Anderson (bass), Ethan Iverson (piano), and David Kling (drums) are playing three different compositions at the same time. What's more, many of the tracks clock in at over 6 minutes, which isn't uncommon for a jazz album, but it's a problem when they sound as if they plod on forever. "Knows the Difference" and "Lost of Love" hit the ground running but never take off. There are a couple of interesting moments, such as the tightly-played "Anthem for the Earnest" and an interesting re-working of "(Theme From) Chariots of Fire," but they're too little too late to balance out the rest of the sluggish tracks on "Suspicious Activity?"
1,The record company reproduced the miracle of the 5 loaves of bread and 2 fishes to expand it to 16 tracks of mostly remixed filler material and price it at top Dollar.  Quite a feat indeed for a 2nd rate UK pop group from the 80s.	I loved a couple of their songs from their earlier era, but by their 3rd album, they went from being Duran Duran to being Air Supply: slow and boring .  The CD is not worth a second listen after track #4.
1,well where to start. this is not a good release. the rapping sounds too much like fred durst. the music is not as primitive as the one limp bizkit does, still it has no great complexity or talent. the lyrics are meaningless, and the vocals aren't really good. overall a bad debut, from a faceless nu metal band. if you like this i'd recommend limp bizkit, newer korn and primer 55
1,Two things stand out as glaring errors and you won't know it until you hear the music on this CD.  The first and most atrocious is the fact that the majority are not originals but are studio tracks which were never used as the final marketed recording! The second mistake was that they chose "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" as the first track...no song is more obviously a studio cut than this iconic song! Couple that with the fact that many people you remember as singing these songs are not those who sing them here. There were far more memorable songs than this that were popular back in the years of WW II and they are nowhere to be found on this collection.  The CD is totally overpriced for what you are getting!
1,Growing up, I loved Helmet and was able to see them during the Meantime years with Primus and Rage Against the Machine. We were a bunch of young hardcore kids and had mad respect for Helmet until that joke of an album Betty came out. After that, I didn't even know Helmet had put out more albums. Then I found out about this album and had very high hopes. I love Page Hamilton and it pains me to say anything negative, but the vocals are hard on the ears. It's just not there. And music-wise, this sounds like a really band trying to imitate Clutch or some kind of garbled Stone Temple Pilots. We all grow up and you can't keep pumping out "Meantime" albums when you're in your 40's, that's a fact. But I'm not a fan of this at all. If you handed me a blank disc with this music, I'd never have guessed it was Helmet.
1,For the songs, yes.  (No, pun, proggies.)  But the remixes from the Gabriel era?  Hideous and sacrilegious:  an appalling messing with pop history.  I'm spluttering thinking how to put the damage done to those tracks by Nick Davis.  I mean, they're not "unrecognizable" or anything, just trumped-up/jumped up "modern" overloud and emphasizing buried parts willy-nilly, with neither rhyme nor the other thing.  This disc LANGUISHES in MY collection on account of Davis's meddlesome codswallop.  Look the stuff up on youtube before you buy this--if you know what i'm on about.  if you don't, caveat emptor or whatever.  OW!!!  Hate it.  Yet, as a lover of both the first three post PG LPs and of course all the REAL stuff, Rael, I can't give this cack one star.  Hence:  a deuce.
1,I am an avid Gospel listener, and a fan of Gladys Knight.  But this is a terrible CD.  When I saw this on the site, I ran out to the store and purchased it...  I couldn't wait for it to come in the mail.  And imagine my surprise when I opened it a played it.  ...  I wish I could git my money back.  This is the first negative CD review that I've every written.  But I think the buyer should beware...  THIS IS NOT A GLADYS KNIGHT CD...  it is a LDS Choir CD directed by Gladys (and not a good choir).  It's not even one song that I would put on my MP3 player.
1,I did not have this original album.  I remember when it first came out. Right after Elvis died.  The original single From Graceland To The Promised Land was the hit.  And the best song on the cd.  I did buy the cd when it came out in 1996.  The thing is that these are Elvis Songs.  I know it would be hard to do a Elvis tribute without Elvis songs.  But even an artist of Merle Haggard's stature can not make you not think that they are Elvis songs.	I guess it depends on how much you're into Elvis to begin with.  How much you'll like this cd.  It has Jailhouse Rock, Love Me Tender, Heartbreak Hotel, Are You Lonesome Tonight and even Blue Christmas.  Plus some other Elvis songs.  And ends with a 17 second spoken tribute.  Like I said I guess it probably depends on how you feel about this kind of stuff.  But I would rather hear Merle doing Merle,.
1,When I first heard Tipsy, for the first few seconds I thought it was hot and it was BUT the whole song is a HOOK. Sure its perfect for the clubs but for everyday listening NO.	And did you hear his 3rd single, he's got the worst voice ever. He's singing the whole damn song when he has an RNB artist singing on the same track.	IF YOU WANT REAL MUSIC GET THE LATEST FROM JADAKISS AND LIL WAYNE
1," Patriotism is indeed the last refuge of a scoundrel. "  Samuel Johnson	Lets be perfectly frank here...the only thing thats truly " shock'n " is that this clown still has a recording contract. Toby Keith simply represents the worst of what this country has to offer to the rest of the world and indeed gives the country music genre a perennial black-eye by parading his ignorance for all to see.	Its bad enough to parlay the "angry American" role into what has become a rather lucrative recording career but its simply beyond the pale when he obtains his rich lifestyle while young Americans are overseas dying for beliefs that he can only sing about. Toby Keith has sacrificed absolutely nothing to obtain his status in life and to pretend to understand the American soldier is almost laughable..if it all wasn't so sad that is! It seems as though Mr. Keith is so busy wrapping himself in the American flag that he simply fails to notice how atrocious and inflammatory his tired " I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore " role has become. Perhaps its time for Mr. Keith to take his "I'm poor but proud" mentality and give the rest of us a break.	Ultimately I cannot fathom how this "artist" ( I'm being facetious here ) sleeps at night by acquiring his wealth on the backs of our soldiers who are too busy risking their lives each and every day.  In the end, while God may forgive Toby Keith for his rank opportunism many of us here at home surely will not!
1,This album is so bad and this band is truly dreadful, and this album goes on my list of the worst albums of the year, I Thought every single song is terrible and to compare this piece of junk to Nine inch nails is ridiculous.		There's nothing even good about this album, just nothing.		and fred durst is just like 50 Cent a big fat joke.		Give It up Limp Bizkit and the rest of the whole entire nu metal/rap metal/rap rock scene, you'll time is over.		Limp Bizkit and this album is so bad, they make bon jovi look like shakespeare		A Big Thumbs Down for me on this album.
1,Decades ago, Leopold Stokowski popularized opera for the general public through "symphonic syntheses." These included Wagner's Ring, Triastan, and Boris Godunov, to mention those I've heard and enjoyed. I was prepared to enjoy Maazel's modern update and expected a fun ride through the gorgeous sonorities of Wagner's score.		Not much enjoyment resulted, however. Maazel is superficial, often ponderous, and much too roughshod with this pastische. It can't all be crash and bang. So I threw the CD away and hope a few others won't make the mistake I did.
1,Great White clearly is the best for a Led Zeppelin quality cover record,no one comes close. That CD is worth getting.
1,I've listened to the album. I do like more songs then I dislike, which is why I gave the album a 3 star instead of a 2 star. Actually I just picked up the CD because of the current single Only Girl. I thought it was part of an older CD, I didn't realize it was a new album.		First off, I HATE the album pictures, when I lifted the CD out and saw Rhianna's VAGINA covered by a flower, I was like, WTF. Which is the reason why I changed the rating back to a 2 star.		Now about the content of album. I definitely wouldn't return the CD-mainly because I can't, but I won't listen to it with my grandmother in the car again.		I like What's My Name, Cheers, Only Girl, Man Down-but after her experience with Chris Brown you think she be done with men like that?, Raining Men, Complicated.		I don't like S & M-It's creepy, Fading, Skin, Love the Way You Lie-I really dislike this song, why would you hook up with a mentally unstable person???		The rest of the album is okay.		I agree the album name doesn't fit. The album seems to be about sex, etc. I would think Only Girl would be better fitting.
1,Save your money!
1,I'm having a tough time writing anything negative about the lovely Carly Simon...it's a bit like criticizing a sacred national treasure.  I'll just say this:  Unless you want to spoil your memories of a very talented and insightful singer, DON'T BUY THIS DISK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Details:  Boring arrangements coupled with a husky-sounding Carly who recorded this like she's under sedation.  Enough said.
1,C'mon everybody! I know that scarce are the days when prog-rock fans are jubilant and that a superstar lineup like LTE always guarantees four star reviews before you've even heard the music, but c'mon! Instead of listening  to it once and being wowed by the virtuosity, take a few deep breaths and  LISTEN to it a few times BEFORE you write your reviews!	With my lecture  complete, let's turn our attention to the album itself. LTE 2 is, of  course, the follow-up to the highly successful LTE 1. However successful  that album might have been, it apparently did not dawn on any member of the  band that they were also very LUCKY to end up with the arrangements they  did. Somehow, all the inspiration was there that week when they recorded  the album. Terrific stuff, but also highly fortuitous.	Unsurprisingly,  LTE 2 follows the same pattern of the debut. The album is evenly divided  between arranged songs and improvised jams. Dealing with the jams first,  unlike the inspired lunacy of "Three Minute Warning" all of the  jams on this album, with the exception of "Liquid Dreams" fall  flat on their respective faces. Chewbacca and 914 are particularly  frustrating - they simply don't go anywhere! Chewbacca drags on for a  excruciating 13 minutes and I seriously wonder if the band included the  track just to pad out the album to 74 minutes. Fortunately, "Liquid  Dreams" saves the album from being a complete embarrassment, and  that's only because Tony Levin steps in at the last minute with a great,  subterranean riff. Alas, such inspired moments are few and far  between.	As for the "composed" material, much of it is  haphazard and dull. "When the Water Breaks" could have certainly  done with a good editor. 17 minutes of the music chasing its tail had me  howling with rage. The band fails to develop a single solid idea, or follow  on from an earlier riff. The song is directionless in the best sense of the  term.	"Acid Rain" recalls the hyper-virtuosity of the debut,  but without any of the playful humour that characterised such passages on  the debut. I appreciate virtuosity just as much as any other prog-rock fan,  but DYNAMICS is a word that should have been foremost in the minds of the  band during the writing process.	The "hybrid nature" of  "Another Dimension" is interesting, but poor writing once again  lets down the track. The flamenco guitar, accordion and the many time  changes would have gelled better had the band put more thought into their  writing. The band try to cover their compositional shortcomings with  furious soloing. It doesn't work.	Only "Biaxident" saves the  day. On this track, everything falls into place. Obviously, the band took  their time with this one, and it certainly shows. The virtuosity is  balanced with great songwriting and dynamics. Every major idea within the  piece is returned to and developed - this is how progressive rock should  be.	So what lets this album down? Too much virtuosity and not enough  solid ideas. Mike Portnoy's drumming especially, is not exactly subtle.  With all that mindless bashing, there's little room for bassist Tony Levin.  In fact, if Portnoy hadn't been ill and downed some "big f...ing  Q" as he calls it, Levin would not have found the space to lay down  that great bass groove on "Liquid Dreams." Subtlety is an art  that Portnoy has yet to master. But if that's what it takes, then maybe he  should develop an addiction to the "big f...ing Q" by the time  Dream Theater records its next album.	For fanatical Dream Theater fans  only.
1,Yesterdays is a compilation of songs made up from the band's first two albums, Yes and Time & A Word.  Those first two albums went virtually unnoticed in the US before the band hit the mainstream with their third release, The Yes Album.  One of the reasons the first two albums failed is that they are not very good.  The band is still trying to find its footing and the lineup wasn't set.  The band was in between albums when they released the album in 1974 and most people were unaware of their first two releases.  The only real bright spot is their version of Simon & Garfunkel's "America" which was recorded in 1972 with the classic Yes lineup.  It is a fabulous interpretation of the song and a highlight from the band.
1,The score to Cast Away is one of my favorites - right up there with Ennio Morricone's underrated instrumentals for "Once Upon a Time in America" - and it's a real shame that, apparently, the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which doesn't even feature the full soundtrack. Luckily I got my hands on an Academy Awards advance album preview for Cast Away - the CD that Universal sent to the Academy Awards crew for Oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks. But I know there are more out there and I think it's time the full soundtrack was released.
1,Her album sucks. The ballads are long and boring. With the exception of "Crazy In Love" and "Baby Boy" the fast songs sucks, or are good and then just get boring. There are only four good songs on this CD. If you are going by the singles, save your money. The only thing good, is that I borrowed the album from my cousin, so I didn't waste my money. And too many of the songs sound alike.. it's just a boring, repetitive, put-you-to-sleep kind of album. It could be a lullaby, it's so boring.
1,This is the last CD I buy that has the "Playlist" logo on it.  This SRV disc, in particular, sounds pretty bad.  The only redeeming quality to it is the song selection; if you only want his hits then this one is for you, especially considering the cheap price.		I've purchased several other CD's under the "Playlist" (from Sony/Epic/Legacy label) name and they ALL sound medicore.  The remastering is amateurish to lousy, especially with the Romantics and Santana releases.
1,Thomas Dolby standout songs on this compilation are "Hyperactive" and of course the song that will always stand the test of time the Top 5 smash "She Blinded Me With  Science".	Otherwise this selection just falls flat.  With repetitive  bore compositions of "The Flat Earth", "Europa" etc.  In my opinion Dolby tries to hard to be a composer et al...Beethoven while  discovering a pop hook.  It doesn't mix nor did it with the buying  public.	To this day Dolbys only hit was "She Blinded Me With  Science".	Not recommended unless you are a fanatic of Dolbys.
1,because THE DEATHSQUAD'S HWANG BLACK SAYS THIS JUST ANOTHER MUSICAL FAD CREATED BY SOME TOP RECORD EXECUTIVES TRYING TO CASH IN ON A PERIOD PIECE WHERE MAMBO-LATIN-DANCE MUSIC IS SELLING MORE THAN EVER. IT'S LOU BEGA  THAT'S THE PROBLEM, IT'S JUST REPETITIVE AND AT TIMES NAUESATING DELIVERY  ABOUT HIS WOMAN. YEAH, IT CAN BE FUN TO DANCE TO, BUT IF IT'S JUST YOU AND  YOUR STEREO, YOU PROBABLY WON'T FIND IT AS FUN. THERE'S A FORMULA FOR THE  LOU BEGA'S OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY: 1 BIG HIT, 2 BIG YEARS, AND BYE. BUT, ON  A NICER POINT, "MAMBO MAMBO" AND "CAN I TICO TICO YOU"  ARE LOADS OF FUN ON THE DANCEFLOOR WITH YOUR RITA AND ERICA, BUT EVERYTHING  ELSE IS "MAMBO NO. 5" WITH A DIFFERENT TITLE. PLEASE SEND  DEATHSQUAD FEEDBACK TO tommyfresh@webtv.net.
1,An absolute train wreck. I didn't even recognize Meat Loaf's voice. And all throughout the album, his poor vocals are bolstered by female singers. But to no avail. Even if his singing had been up to par, the songwriting here is just awful. I continued listening thinking there might be at least one decent track, but no, the entire album is just a mess.
1,I love the old Leon Russell albums. I also really liked the "Union" album with Elton John. This album shows a tired Leon backed up with an orchestra, which lends nothing to Leon's music. This album has only one decent song, and the rest is a bore. Not sure why producer Elton John didn't help him  make a better album. It seems he just isn't in to it. Don't bother with this junk, and look up his older work. I'm a Leon fan, but not of this album. It's just an empty shell.
1,Amazon really needs to do something with these slicksters. Why when I order the album that clearly says legacy edition I recieved the 30 year old beat up original from the early 1980s!!!!They knew this wasn't the legacy edition, and this is beginning to become a common thing for me. Ordering one thing and getting something completely different. If you want the legacy edition please don't buy from a third party, I don't understand why some people feel the need to rip people off with old outdated junk
1,You've heard one song, you've heard them all, for the most part. Nothing to write home about. Disappointing.
1,What do you get when you combine crunchy guitars, screaming and rapping, and lots of anger? Right! The exact same thing I've heard over and over again from faceless new metal bands that will be on where are they now by 2004. This CD is no exception. Nonpoint are not unique in any way. Everything they have done has been done infinitely better by Linin Park and RATM.
1,I don't actually hate or dislike the music on this CD, but rather the 1 star rating is for the fact that this particular CD has a defect that apparently is on every copy.  Unsurprisingly, yet another record company SCREW-UP!  I started out buying an inexpensive domestic copy (latest/most recent CD version based on what I could tell), and it had a defect approximately 1:30 into song no. 4 (Time Out), sort of sounds like a clipping sound/noise.  It's very brief, but noticeable enough to really stand out.  I didn't bother with an exchange as I figured the defect would be on every copy from that manufactured batch.  So I decided to try a high priced Japanese import CD, and guess what - it has the same defect.  So apparently the same original source tapes must be used for every CD version of the release.  It's just amazing how many record companies have never heard of "quality control" or just don't care about.  I guess I'll check out the tune on iTunes to see if they have a clean copy of the song.  Bottom line - for this particular CD do NOT waste your money on any of the high priced imports.		iTune Update - just listened to a portion of the song on iTunes and it appears to have the same defect - so also don't bother with wasting a $1.00 on an iTunes download.
1,though i felt predisposed to dislike this before listening to it, i thought i'd be a good ol' sport and give it a spin.  i did in earnest try to suspend my hatred of their first single, the wholly abrasive and stupidly infectious "light and day," but i was confronted inevitably with the same big, lumbering problem.		the problem is this: tim delaughter (head spree, possible candidate for cult figure like jim jones or marshall applewhite), obviously admires the flaming lips.  in fact, it's all too obvious that he has based his entire lacklustre career around the whims and musical activities of one wayne coyne.  his first disposable little musical outfit was tripping daisy, who did their best to replicate the psychedelic/white noise freak out music of the flaming lips during their early warner bros years, only doing so by supplanting the ingenuity and inventiveness of the lips with cold, gushing banality.  this new musical project is no different.  to be blunt, it sounds like the flaming lips album the soft bulletin were it completely devoid of coyne's brilliance and undertaken by a band that is familiar with only one elo tune: mr. blue sky.  i swear to christ they use that same damned beat in every song.		anyway, i really did try to subsume my immense lip-o-philia while listening to this album, but it's nearly impossible to do so when being constantly bombarded with an inferior product.  the concussive overuse of orchestral flourishes is unabashedly unrestrained.  the lips recorded the soft bulletin (which this is so obviously spurned from) with three people.  three singular and uniquely talented individuals who could craft interesting arrangements and interpretations of songs using everything at their disposal.  the polyphonic spree has - what, like 20 some members? - and they can't conjure up one worthwhile idea?  none of them?  jesus.  now THAT is the kind of depressing realization that paralyzes you.  save for one song which is moderately okay if i had a few drinks in me ("hold me now" - though the chorus is mushy and cringe-inducing) there isn't anything on here particularly catchy.  what's the point of having all of these disparate instruments teeming together when they are without direction?  together we're heavy?  no, i'm afraid together you compose a potent repellent to consciousness.  every song is unfocused and ineluctably collapses inwardly on itself under the immense weight of all the f'ing harps and glockenspiels.		this is an uninspired and lamentably lame effort from a languorous little band, an exemplary piece of sappy saccharine garbage that if consumed in large amounts could lead to eventual amputation from diabetes.  the sentiments expressed here are harmless, yes, but they are as gimmicky and forced as any song from those champions of mediocrity they might be giants.		i give it two stars because the packaging is misleading and very impressive.  so impressive i actually restrained my usual derma of practiced cynicism to give it a listen.  it was a traumatic and irreputable experience, yes, but the packaging comes with a dvd!  which is indubitably of some use to those of you who haven't heard the soft bulletin, yes' fragile, or elo's mr. blue sky.		my friend peter has a band consisting of 14 people called exploding foetus.  one of the band member's obligations is to set fire to things.  the discrepency between them and the polyphonic spree is simple: his band at least has some vague idea as to what to do with its superfluous members.  then again, i suppose mr. delaughter is trying to ornament and disguise his blandness with having the trans-siberian orchestra as his backing band, though to my ears there's no avail.
1,This disc lasted no time before it was scratched. Seems to have been cheaply made. I would enjoy it if it played well!
1,As a big fan of the film I was confident I would like this.  I was disapointed.  Just wasen't like the music in the movie.  I'll stick with the original soundtrack.
1,If this is the stuff TS wants to put out there with their name, so be it, but its wack don't waste your money....only 2 good songs..not anywhere near good enough. The man spent who knows how long hyping this pos...no more respect for him. Miami lookin terrible if this mia finest.....lol
1,I guess I don't get it. This music is very boring and drab. People think that this band is genius, but I think that it is a bunch of whiny garbage. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because everyone in the world seems to love this band. Oh and I seem to see a few people (Amazon editor included)comparing Radiohead to Pink Floyd??? This is Blasphemy! Roger Waters has more talent and creativity in his stool sample than Thom York could ever even dream. I hate to say it but their only good song was "Creep".
1,Lenny must need some quick Christmas cash to have a greatest hits album out this time of year. He's only had 6 mediocre songs played on the radio,and the only one I ever enjoyed was "Are you going to go my way."  He copies every Artist,from the Beatles to Hendricks on all his records. His two biggest hits,"Fly away," and "Its ain't over till its over," are the same cords and words repeated over and over again. I have no idea how this artist gets airplay.
1,Do not waste your money.
1,Even for the most die hard of Byrds fans, there is really no reason to buy  this album.  There are a few decent songs - Glory, Glory, I Trust,  Kathleen's Song, which are available elsewhere (like the box set, or the  Unissued disc).  The album truly lags in the middle, with the trio of  novelty songs.  Skip Battin & Kim Fowley's wretched Tunnel of Love and  Citizen Kane (I can't decide which one qualifies as THE worst Byrds song  ever), and McGuinn's worst Gene Tryp song: I Want to Grow Up To Be A  Politician.  Can anyone say "scraping the bottom of the  barrel"?	As everyone knows by now, this album got the "Let It  Be" treatment after it ws in the can, and it's a shame, because the  unadulterated tracks, such as Pale Blue or Kathleen's Song, are quite  beautiful.  It's too bad that the Byrds made such a creative misstep after  the great album that is (untitled).  Clarence White was tremendiously  underused on this album, and his magnificant playing is sorely missed, an  ability that lifted Dr Byrds & Mr Hyde out of the realm of the truly  bad, and salvaged a couple of cool tracks there.	The bottom line is, if  you're thinking about buying this, skip it and pick up a copy of Farther  Along instead.
1,First off, let me say I love Nick Cave's music. However, this release left me as cold as a polar bear. Everything on this album moves at a snails pace and Nick's voice is mixed way too loud. It's like Nick is standing right behind you singing at full volume. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with Nick Cave singing really loudly behind me. Also, Nick's lyrics and gimmicks are wearing thin. It's called progression Nick! Please do it! PS The Birthday Party are really cool!
1,garble mess
1,The album is decent - some good tunes.  But some of the songs that are longer get boring because there is no new music introduced - they just keep repeating the basic tune.  Also, I am not exactly sure why this is considered prog.  It certainly doesn't come close to the masters of prog like Genesis, Marillion, Flower Kings, IQ, etc.  I wouldn't buy any more of their CD's based on this one.
1,This is what we get ?? Mostly Garbage & it's too bad as some of these songs sound like they could have been cool if Gillette would stay out of them ! I am buying a Lita ford album not a jim & Lita album .	  That said , i have been buying lita's solo album since "out for blood" hit stores , i was hoping for a good rock n roll album & that is not what it is ,lita needs to get into a studio , Leave Jim at home & get a producer on the job .	  This cd is average at best , what a bummer after such a long wait .
1,This looks like a mix of Politics of Dancing with his lame pink blondee whining Reflections type album...Nothing new, I was hoping to see a new direction. Paul, re-listen to: Out there and Back, first Politics of Dancing and drop the trendy, crappy Amsterdam trance, be yourself!
1,I got this from my local library and glad I didn't pay for it.		Most of the DVD side is already found on Arch Allies, the rest is the same old stuff done again, and again...........		Save your $$$$$
1,I always like Toby's music but with only 8 albums out and one GH disc already where are all of the hits on this short CD.  There are at least three songs off of his most current album which was released before this that are not on the GH disc.  At least make it complete especially when you have room on the disc.
1,I don't need to say much about this album. I threw Issues from Korn away because of the deathly ridiculous lyrics. Nobody deserves to be hurt. Don't waste your time and get this album. Suicide prevention.
1,I see that Rammstein peformed on this tour, but where are the songs by them? OK, so they have Du Hast, but common, they have like 20 great songs! Korn and Bizkit suck, let us all understand that who aren't 12 year olds. Orgy and Rammstein need more tracks on this album! What is wrong with the people that made this???
1,I've read the other reviews speaking of Mr John's intent on this album, and he definitely succeeded; it is an up-tempo, "jingly-jangly" joyous sounding album, it's just not that interesting. Any of these songs could be dubbed over any animated movies "the character is having a great day" montage.	Is it bad? As a piece of work, no. But, for me, it just doesn't have anything I care to hear more than once. It generally sounds all the same; one long song with various musical breaks. I am a fan of Elton John, several of his songs are my go-to for practice on my piano, and a week doesn't go by that I don't hear several of his songs from days long past. Songs that are moving, that have statements - this album hopefully appeals to the casual listener, or just someone not me.
1,This was a major disappointment. Only a couple songs worth even listening to. Not at all what I was hoping for
1,How boring is this?  Is this all a band needs to do these days, record songs in the style of really good bands?  Not that I have a problem with that but at least those band injects a little of their personality into the music they make.  Remy Zero fails to do that to the "music" they make. This is CD is poorly written and it sounds like different artists that we all know and love.  I would compare this to a deodorant that has a sticker on it that says if you like Right Guard then you will love Special Squeeze!  Remy Zero is nothing more than overblown hype.  Avoid at all costs.
1,My mother had Johnny Rivers Live at the Whiskey A Go Go on album back in the mid sixties. It was completely different than what is offered here. I distinctly remember several songs that aren't on this collection. He did his own version of Suzy-Q. Also had Stop in the name of love, and Land of 1000 dances. If I thought about it long enough I'm sure I could think of others that aren't there as well. I was only 12 or 13 back then. I loved that album and wore it out completely. So where did these songs go? This being a two album set that's currently offered I have no way of knowing which songs are supposedly from which album? But I do know that this isn't right. I really wanted to buy that album again but this is so completely different and wrong!
1,So who keeps convincing 70's pop/rock icons that "getting back to  their roots" means weak melodies and ultra-sparse arrangements that were never reflective of their early music???		This doesn't sound anything like the Elton John we've all grown to love and admire over the past 40+ years.  Nothing on this album even remotely resembles Elton's career-best "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" or more recent triumphs like "Captain & The Kid," or jaw-dropping beautiful "Original Sin."		Nope. What you get here are SHOCKINGLY weak melodies that lack the kind of arrangements that may have resuscitated some of these songs.  (Elton, we know you can play piano, but someone needs to tell you that, well, no one cares!  We just want infectious, fun, and emotive melodies and your wonderful voice.)		And even when the album gets it right with "Home Again" (a truly nice song), the second half of the arrangement has some strange kind of cat purring or snoring sound in the background that puts a damper even on this.		I was so excited for a new Elton John album, this was truly disappointing from such a talented songwriter/singer.
1,Why is there no growling and deep yells?  Why is there a whiny punk voice that seems to always overthrow one of the most interesting voices in music today?  Why does one of my favorite bands build you up so much then kind of let you down?  This album would have 5 out of 5 except that i all i hear half the time is a punk voice.  Serj has one of the most captivating voices i have heard in along time.  I don't even like this genre of music at all but system has always hooked me with it's raw sound, and a voice that just pulls you in, i hate punk music and that's what i think of when i hear whiny darron, it just makes me mad that such a great band has to whine so much.  But i can't help not to love this cd.  It just is a let down.
1,Sometimes I wish I could go back and get my money back. Necro made one good album but got money from me for everyone he did. That's why artists get paid.
1,I am fan of Mr. Jarreau and, as such,  have most of his recordings and attended his concerts.  This recording, however, is one that I listened once and once only then, put it on the rack.  The material is important to those that followed Mr. Duke's music, which I am sure will find it entertaining.	Saludos,	Rolando
1,Do not buy this version! Parts have been re-recorded! This is not the original album as it's supposed to be! Ozzy Osbourne did this same offense not too long ago and now he's being sued. Stay away! Do not endorse this criminal activity of changing recordings. Buy the original instead!
1,This VERBAL PENETRATION features Jesse doing his guitar thang in a bluesy mood and R&B vibes unlike any of the A&M recordings in the late 80's, but he's still on Prince's you-know-what. Jesse showed the world his identity, finally on BARE MY NAKED SOUL in 1996, he rocks out and abandoned the Minneapolis sound that he's know since joining The Time, but it fell on deaf ears.
1,This is one of the worst songs I have heard. It made me sick after hearing it. This single is a turd. DONT EVEN THINK OF BUYING IT.YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY.AVOID THIS CRAP and get FOOL FOR THE CITY from FOGHAT instead.
1,Smashing your head repeatedly with a shovel and then shredding your face with the claw end of a hammer would be more pleasurable than listening to this.  The "musical" equivalent of a steaming turd on a hot August day.
1,O.K. alright I get it, I think. Then again, maybe not. At any rate, to be totally honest I must confess I am absolutely 100% confused! Although I came to realize at some point in my musical developement that Ms. Mitchell was a gifted songwriter, I discovered her rather late in the game. When I was listening to rock music, she didn't really appeal to me because she was a folk musician and her stuff was kind of dreary and depressing. Later in her career, there was all these references to Jazz (Mingus, Jaco, etc. etc.) I really didn't understand why people were referring to her as a "Jazz artist". I still don't know, but I think I am beginning to be clear as to why some folks misconstrued the obvious and various affectations that surfaced in her work.		Look people, this is not a Jazz LP from a Jazz Artist by any stretch of the imagination. This is a beautifully orchestrated and arranged Pop album of standards with a few brilliant Jazz musicians thown in and a whole boatload of masterful classical musicians who make up this massive orchestra. Vince Mendoza's orchestrations are nearly flawless. Heavy and extremely grandiose and sweeping in scope, they are quite magnificent and erudite in their execution. The harmonics in various places are quite adventurous and clearly influenced by the presence of the iconic Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter. The broad dynamics and extensive tapestries these charts create are astonishing in their lushness. Vince Mendoza is truly gifted and well versed to say the least, but is this his album or Joni's?		Larry Klein as the producer unfortunately overshot his intended goal of showcasing Ms. Mitchell as one of Billie Holiday's long lost children returning home to the "Lady In Satin" mansion from which she ran away as a child. As a result of the hugeness of the orchestra and the overblown crescendos and triple forte dynamics, Joni is massacred in the process. The outcome was rather similar to the effect the exquisite charts of the genius and peerless Maestro Gerald Wilson wrote for the talented Miss Julie London. Joni like Julie's voice is not strong enough to carry all of this massive weight. On top of this she is poorly miked and mixed rendering her completely inaudible in the process.		It's obvious there was a missed opportunity here. A lean tight sextet, fronted by Mr. Hancock and Mr. Shorter, would have been a far better environment for Ms. Mitchell. That is if the intent was to present her in a bona-fide Jazz context. She has enough respect for the artform and probably enough qualities and experience in her voice to pull it off. Her attempts to capture and display the correct phrasing, nuances and emotion in her readings are not overlooked. While she lacks the stylings or sophistication of a Jerri Winters, Claudia Thompson, or Julie London or the colorful tapestries of an early Pinky Winters, she at least thank heavens is not awash in the affectations of a Chris Connor or Anita O'day. Anyway, next time maybe they may get it right.
1,I'm gonna just make this plain and simple,this album is way too long and most of it has that west coast feel too it(which isn't bad if you like it).  Not that many guest appearnces which make it good but again, this album suffers from way too many of the same formulas on some of the songs. Tales of  drugs, sex, and violence. If this album could have been cut to 15 tracks and had some songs of sex, some songs of violence and some songs of  bling bling, street tales, and etc., this album could have been a classic in a way, beacuase Master P can rhyme and can make hits, but this album is more of a publicity stunt to try to get people to buy his last album which really isn't his last album( Master P is rich and is a better money maker than music maker). '' Da Last Don'', can be past on as of many other Master P albums after Ghetto D. If you are a hardcore No limit fan or a Master P fan you can pick this one up but if not, I suggest you past on this mediocore effort.
1,I wish I hadn't wasted my money and time on this.  Why did Green Day have to sell themselves out?  I mean, I'm still a fan of all their past albums, but this is by far the worst ablum I've heard in years (well, second to anything by 50 Cent).		This would have been great if: 1. they didn't go with a mainstream alternative/rock sound.  2. it wasn't heavily laden with politics.  See, I want to listen to music, not hear somebody's political viewpoint.		And, please, everybody stop calling Green Day punk.  They are not punk.  Take it from a fan of the band, they are not punk.  They are alt/rock/pop.  "They're punk because they rebel against the system".  That would actually make them hippies.  Punks rebel against society and they don't care what people think of them.  Green Day does care and they're not rebelling against the system.  They're not punk.		Anyways, if this is the direction this band is going, I'm just going to have to turn my back on them.
1,I had to edit this review 8 times before Amazon would post it, sheesh...	Hmmm, guess I'm too late to explain everything that's wrong with this album. Didn't this have less than a two star average? Anyways, where to begin...		-Paris Hilton released this; I guess that's our 2358516th sign of the apocalypse.	-There are people in the world that like this, and her,...that's another common sign of humanity's decline.	-They are going to play one of tracks on my High School retreat at the dance, which shows my sorry generation's stupidity and what future generations will be looking up to...		People, there is nothing good about this h o e. She's an ugly b**** who only thinks about getting hammered and has never achieved anything in her life worth being proud of. She has boyfriends for about the exact time as 15 minutes of fame and is dumb enough to lose things and know that it'll become a publicity stunt and she has enough money to waste to buy a billion of what she lost. Instead of actually doing something with the money that someone was dumb enough to soon die and leave for her, she spends it on useless, piss poor material that she'll forget ever existed the next day, or until the next party is over. Paris, although rich as h e l l (Amazon strictly wrote to me they don't want me to write h e l l), is nothing more than a lousy two-bit sk ank worth less than a real sk ank. To her, life is a serious joke that can only be enjoyed with money. There are people all around the world dying and living lives where they don't have anything that we have. They live off of what they can to survive and make a living out of whatever they can. Those people are the ones who are great individuals who live day by day without material wealth and can say that there could be a better hope for them. This is one of the reasons I hate mainstream and popularity; it's complete bulls***. Money is wasted everyday on material, fakes, cover-ups, and stories that no one would give a f*** about if they had a brain that thought for itself.		Listen, just...just forget this ever existed...please. Forget that garbage like this was ever recorded and ended up in your face. Go back and listen to whatever you listen to, because I know it would be a foot better or light years ahead of this in all aspects.
1,straight up Ga Ga has musical chops, she can play, can sing and understands melody and Groove, however alot of this album as with some of her other material at times comes off as Karoke style Madonna leftovers and feels contrived and when her imagery takes center stage you are stuck with a well skilled artist who is polished in the manipulation of selling a image,which leaves the music at hand cold and calculated.  she has real talent,however the gimmicks at times tend override and if she keeps putting out half baked songs which just are rethreads of madonna and countless other acts then she will be done before she has a chance to truly shine. she got a chance to really be something as a artist if she works on real songs.
1,I had heard for years what an underground pop classic this was; forget it. The hooks and melodies don't stick. You'll rarely return to it. I hope he remains close to Jack White--he'll need it.
1,Okay, I'm writing this review to tell errors of the song "Come Clean."	Okay, first off, we'll start with the lyrics. She said "Trying to fit a square into circle was no lie."Give me a break, you can't do that! She also said "I'm shedding/Shedding every color/Trying to find a pigment of truth beanith my skin. Ewwwww! Doesn't make sense!	Second off, the voice. She sounded like a cow mooing when she said "I'm coming clean."She tried to sing high notes here. She can't. My 5 year old sister can sing this song better than Hilary and she doesn't even know how to speak the proper english.	Third off, the music. The music is okay. But, Hilary ruined it and so did the lyrics.	In all, DON'T BUY THIS SINGLE, I'M BEGGING YOU, PLEASE!!
1,Sounds like it is being played on an Edisson phonograph, without the scratches! Do I need to type this? Obviously there are much better P.I. on Amazon, so... stay away from this one!
1,When one first looks at the track selection of Led Zeppelin's first official "Best Of..." album, it appears that the songs included were chosen by a record executive, eager to flaunt the band's most easily recognizable tunes for a quick profit. But what's this? After flipping through the CD booklet (which does contain some rare band photos and beautiful shots of the heavens), we see that this obligatory compilation was in fact produced by Zeppelin's own guitarist, Jimmy Page. Well, I guess Page knows what he's doing, but as a self-proclaimed critic, it's my job to think I know better.	"Early Days: The Best of Led Zeppelin, Volume One" is an unimaginative look at the band's first handful of years, its disappointing quality made more depressing by the fact that Zep were (and still are) such rock-n-roll giants. Some of these tracks are only "hits" and not really their best. The run-down of "Early Days" is as follows; although it is fortunate that a lot of these more recognizable tracks are not as drab as many of their other "classics," this meager compilation yields nothing fresh. The first four tracks are taken straight from Zeppelin's debut, and their arranged order here can easily be obtained by using the original album and the program button on your compact disc player (though 'Communication Breakdown' comes with an enhanced-CD video that's nice for your computer). The case is the same with the last five tracks, all taken from the "IV" album, leaving only three songs from that particular record that weren't used. In between are some sparse songs (in quantity) from the albums "II" and "III."	Overall, "Early Days: The Best of Led Zeppelin, Volume One" is something anyone can cook up using the original albums they already have, and their own CD-cassette recorder (as most "best- of" packages are). But, if you're a die-hard collector, or just dying to see the enhanced video for 'Communication Breakdown,' then this is obviously something for you.
1,'Rage Against the Machine' should now change their name to 'Part of the Machine' since their record label, Sony, is one of the biggest corporate 'machines' on the planet.	As far as I'm concerned, their 'rage' is just a big marketing ploy by Sony and MTV to get the little teen or twenty-something headbangers to go out and buy their CDs.  I wouldn't give these liars and posers a dime....	If I could give them a minus 10, I'd do so.
1,Beginning in 1983 I started buying cds.  Over time, I have accumulated well over a thousand.  So, I have come to encounter some great and some not-so-great sounding cds.	I already have the Kingston Trio Collector's Choice and Capitol Double Play series.  Each are different but excellent in their own way. The double play series was except for debut and hungry I (mono) remixed from the original 3 track master tapes, not run through Capitol's famous echo chambers. The collectors choice are from the original Capitol album masters as released.	However, the Real Gone nine album collection startled me.  The first cd, which is the Trio's first two albums, is OK.  The majority of the other discs are mediocre, taken from vinyl and lack ambiance.	But........the mastering of "The Last Month Of The Year" is by far the worst-sounding, atrocious, bizarre, unlistenable, excruciating  piece of music I have heard, including vinyl, 8-track, cassette or any other recording media. It requires listening to it just to comprehend how bad it is. The only way I can describe it-- taking a well-worn lp, transferring it to cassette, , putting it in a cheap boombox, dropping it down a well, then hanging a cheap microphone at the edge of the top of the well, recording it onto another cheap boombox.	There is absolutely no excuse for this.  How reviewers give it 3, 4, or five stars is beyond me.
1,I got this CD because I thought it would be something different. Well, it definitely is. The music was exotic, and, in some cases, just plain weird. I was hoping that "Hidden Melodies Revealed" would be different, and exciting with a twist to the arrangements and the instruments used.  It wasn't.  It was very difficult to listen to.  For me, it was extremely inconsistent musicaly.  It had no blend...no flow at all.  Just didn't seem to fit at all.  All in all, this album, with its random monkey screeches and poetry tracks, was not something that I enjoyed. I suppose I would recommend it for people who enjoy completely unique sounds, but not for someone looking for accessible music with a slight twist.
1,When GAmma RAy began to replace musicians at will as somekind of modern BLACK SABBATH, I realized that thing would never be the same again. This album is clearly inferior to LAND OF THE FREE.
1,Hey. I know this has been out for quite a while. Don't waste your money. I listen to all types of rock and this was painful to listen to. I expected more from GNR. Tried to listen to it multiple times to see if it would grow on me. Unfortunately  it did not. I want my money back.
1,I could have weeded. I could have painted the downpipes and guttering. The bathroom needed to be cleaned but it was serenely ignored. Prodigally, I sat down with this set and trifled away a few hours.		One could almost indict Sir Simon on a charge of plagiarism. He has clearly set out to imitate the likes of Zinman and Harnoncourt  - such as they are - with no ideas of his own. After all, he has never displayed any sort of affinity with Beethoven, as evidenced by his ho-hum survey of the piano concertos. And this cycle is indubitably the VPO's blandest excursion in Beethoven - how they must have slunk away afterwards.		Here, the sleek, homogenised, emasculated performances of Symphonies One to Four could almost be labeled a 'Salute to Maestro Zinman', albeit with less inner conviction or insight. Five is devoid of genuine grunt for all the blare of the brass. The Sixth is the most cadaverous rendition in the market; it is actually the set's claim to fame: what other Pastoral brings to mind Death Valley? Seven and Eight are the equivalent of low-fat yoghurt and equally as memorable. Nine is less worse - at least it has a sense of occasion - but it does not trouble the front-runners in this domain. Sir Simon's incessant point-making is ruinous.		This endeavour begs a wider question: what was EMI trying to achieve here in squandering its resources, meagre as they are nowadays, on an endeavour of this scale? It was never going to challenge the frontrunners. At best it was a cynical marketing exercise.		Sir Simon should cloister his tendancies to record Beethoven for a decade or so; he should ruminate, reflect and perhaps fall to his knees. Self-flagellations and pious ejaculations might be in order. Perhaps then, and only then, will he have something worthwhile to say, Beethoven-wise, to the world.		Until then, behold the Flight of the Uber-Turkeys.
1,Please note: I listened to the sacd/cd hybrid version, but just on a regular cd player. I do not own any surround sound equipment.		It gives me absolutely no joy to be so negative about this release. I was hoping for this to be an improvement over Haitink's CSO Mahler 3rd, which ain't bad (not great, either), but this is even more disappointing. It makes me wish now that I had never said anything nasty about his recent French one for the Naive label (L'Orchestre National de France). That one was positively thrilling compared to this snooze-fest. For starters, this is among the very slowest versions of the Mahler 6th symphony ever recorded (Sinopoli has the slowest one on record). But it possess none of the sleezy decadence that made the Sinopoli M6 sort of interesting (way too slow in the andante movement, though), much less the steely resolve and grim determination of the old John Barbirolli one. Haitink is just grim . . . and dour. Surely the CSO could have held off for some fresh blood to offer a few new or interesting insights. I just don't find anything new or interesting here at all. Let's begin on the gruesome details.		I have no problem with any conductor starting M6 with such a slow march, especially when you have low strings that are as strong as those in Chicago. But that also means that you have to conjure up some degree of contrast when you reach the sweeping second subject; the so-called "Alma theme". Haitink boldly fails to go where a few men have, indeed, gone. He's just slow and trudgy from start to finish - well over 25 minutes worth! I could have forgiven all that if he had simply whipped up some genuine excitement at the close of the movement. But just as with several spots in his recent CSO M3, he gets a lot of loudness from the famous Chicago brass, but with insufficient forward motion or sense of enthusiasm to go along with it. All this makes me think that Barbirolli made the right call by leaving out the exposition repeat. If you think that tragic means dark, heavy, and slow - from start to finish, mind you - your ship has arrived.		Scherzo: why bother? I think this performance is a good argument for dropping the scherzo altogether - thus ending the never ending debate over movement order, once and for all - and turning Mahler 6 into the greatest three movement symphony every written. Seriously, this is about as dull and poker-faced as you'll ever hear this oh-so-spooky scherzo. It's very well played, and little more. If you want to hear what this scherzo can - and should - contribute to the overall narrative of the symphony, try Rattle (either one); Gergiev/LSO (just came out too); Neumann/Czech Phil. (Canyon Classics), or Macal/Czech Phil. (Exton). Even Sinopoli provided some interesting contrast with his Mahler 6 sludge-fest, just by taking the scherzo at a relatively quick tempo.		Andante Moderato: Haitink isn't ridiculously slow with this - well less than 17 minutes, actually. But it might as well have been 19 minutes. Again, the playing is there but not much else. For example, there's absolutely nothing graphic or outdoors-y about the brief "Alpine" passage, located about six minutes in, under Haitink's dreary direction (rising, unsion horns; on-stage cowbells; naive sounding solo trumpet; swirling violin trills) - how could it all have fallen so flat? On the plus side, the Chicago strings do themselves proud over the movement's climactic passage. But it's all too little, too late. What's all the romantic fuss about?		Finale: from bad to worse. For example, let's just take the slow introductory section. There's a brief, funeral dirge for low woodwinds, followed by the low brass, that's located no more than 90 seconds into the movement. Haitink takes this at an extremely slow tempo, but then fails to make a ritard at the one spot where he could have inserted a huge one to great effect: the last A-major to A-minor chord meltdown, just before the movement begins its first allegro (fast) episode.		Haitink also fails to build up the tempo while traversing the chromatic (half step) harmonies leading up to the first hammer blow - which, by the way, is rather underwhelming in comparison to all the loud brass surrounding it - or approach the second one with much sense of trepidation, for that matter. Both Gergiev and Tennstedt (1991) are far better at objectifying the differences between the two hammer-strokes, just by the way that they approach them. As for the hammer-strokes themselves, I'm more bothered by the balances at those critical junctures, than by the slightly underwhelming sound of the hammer itself (the second one gets reinforced by the optional, additional percussion).		The famous Chicago brass dominate at those big junctures, just as they should, but to the extent that the brass sound as though they're sitting in the front row along with everyone else. No doubt, that kind of effect is a byproduct of Mr. Mallison's recording technique (very wide sounding), along with the relatively shallow depth of Chicago's Orchestra Hall. As so often happens, the strong Chicago trumpets make little or no distinction across the various gradations of forte - it's all just equally loud. Again, that's probably more an issue of logistics and acoustics, than any negligence on their part. I just don't like it when the trumpets sound front and center - literally! Perhaps a better solution would have been to put the horns where the trumpets normally are (front and center, but along the back), and put the trumpets more off to the side.		Well, why go on? I could point out that Haitink interestingly makes a huge ritard for the brief "false victory parade" passage, located before the spot where the third hammer-stroke originally existed (and sometimes gets reinserted) - and gets his horns to blast a true fortissimo there too - but then fails to bring out the all-important percussion underneath the horns and sweeping violins. But what would be the point? The battle is over, and so am I.		If you want the big guns of an American orchestra in Mahler 6, I would strongly recommend sticking to the recent Eschenbach/Philly one on Ondine. While Eschenbach may not be perfect either, he's vastly more varied and interesting with his conducting than Haitink. The balances are also far, far better than here. And while I'm not a huge fan of Tilson-Thomas' Mahler in general (his 8th should be great), his sixth is much better too. It's also a shame that DG never remastered and reissued their Abbado/CSO M6 on to their fine "Originals" series, because it's really pretty good - much better than this. As for Haitink, his best Mahler 6 is still the very first one he made with the Concertgebouw. His Berlin remake was pretty dull in the first two movements, but the slow movement and finale were darn near excellent - much, much, much better than this. Even his French one had its moments.		Perhaps these would have appeared to have been great performances in a "live" situation (albeit loud), but something simply isn't translating on to disc. Instead, I wish that the well meaning folks at the CSO had waited for someone new to get a crack at it. In my opinion, this is a wasted effort for the CSO. And I take no pleasure in saying that.
1,FREAK! 7 A$$HOLES THE SUCK ASS AND BECUZ OF RAYANA AND DEZ WHERE FIGHTING AND THEN THE WRITE A SONG ABOUT DEZ ON THERE NEW CD THE SUCK! AND SO DOZ THERE NEW SONG ENEMY!!!!!!**** 7B***HES DO DEVILDRIVER AND COALCHAMBER!!!!!!!1
1,I understand nowadays that metal bands are doing the whole "we didn't want to write the same album twice" thing, which is something I 100% agree with. Prime example of a band that writes the same album every time is Senses Fail.		Impending Doom is a deathcore band that I've always been fond of. Something I've always admired is their dedication to their faith, and incorporation of the music that they play. Nailed Dead Risen was a great album and was very innovative in the deathcore genre. The Serpent Servant in comparison sounds 1000% more professional, but also 1000% more generic. They did away with the death growls/squeals, threw in a million blastbeats, a million guitar chugs, and topped it off with a few seconds of horribly placed guest vocals. The only songs that have any depth on the album are More Than Conquerors, and Anything Goes. One track that sounds out to me on the album (in a bad way) is Revival: America... lyrically, the song is about as pointless as almost anything you can think of.		From a professional, serious standpoint, this was a great effort for the band. But that's not why people buy albums. If people bought albums for the production sound factor alone, Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album would be the worst selling album of all time. But people buy albums for their musical appeal and hooks, and The Serpent Servant just doesn't cut it.		Do yourself a favor and go buy the new album from Oceano. As far as this new album from Impending Doom, it's just another space filler in my CD holder. 2 good songs out of 11? Huge disappointment from this once innovative band.
1,darius rucker  has always  been able to ride the wave be it with Hootie and the blowfish from pop to country. he has a build in formula.his voice  stays in good form,however the material doesn't challenge or take him anywhere  however he has been able to bridge the gap from his chracter as a artist to his successful career now in country though will he ever get the material to balance all the styles and truly bring him full circle.
1,It all boils down to this: The original Queensryche that made albums such as the original Operation: Mindcrime, Rage for Order, and Empire is gone - and has been for some time. That band was killed off by ego, vanity, and members simply losing touch with reality (far too many artists seem afflicted by this fate. Maybe they should move back into a $*** apartment in the city again to see if they can recapture the magic?). The current band gives us albums like this one - that really don't say anything to anyone, even though they contain a novel's worth of words. This album commits a further sin in that it tries to rewrite the events in the original Operation: Mindcrime.		In terms of the actual songs, they're all pretty bad and lacking genius. The Chase, which has Ronnie James Dio as the voice of Dr. X, sounds like a parody of the heaviest parts of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. Speed of Light seems to borrow a lot from Zeppelin, but doesn't really connect. The Hands is one of the best songs on the album, but it borrows heavily from Mindcrime. The worst part of each of these songs, however, is that they all just seem like Nikki whining - or, in truth, lead singer Tate complaining, since  he pens most of the lyrics on this album.		Do yourself a favor and buy the remastered original Mindcrime or the impressive Livecrime instead of wasting your money on this album.		Side note: There has been some question about how this album has been able to garner so many five-star reviews. Try this: check out the reviewers and their other writings. While there are a few high-star reviews from valid accounts, most appear to be spammed posts from dummy accounts. These accounts are controlled either by 1) a few over-zealous fans with hotmail access or 2) a marketing team. Take care with any review you read (even this one). :)
1,Two things: I don't really care if these girls are young. If you're good when you're young, you can be a progidy(however that's spelled). if your bad young, you're bad, and that's all there is to it. This "band"(it pains me to even call them that) has one record out, for one reason. They're rich. Fun fact: If you own the record company, you can produce yourself quite easily. Yes, it's not hard to say that Smoosh is bad; That doesn't mean that they're not. It really doesn't matter to me if they're "enthusiastic" or "corageous." It does matter to me if they suck. It's strikingly obvious that in one year, two years tops, they will still only have one album, and be completely forgotten about. Why? Because they're old enough to at least act like a real band, not a privately owned kids bop, but they're young enough so they can still be cute, and at least have a partial excuse for why they sound like a dying cow attached to a breathing machine.
1,Blu Cantrell first sang back for Faith Evans and the song "Hit 'Em Up Style" is smooth and catchy so I decided to get the album. Too bad I didn't like any of her other songs and "Hit 'Em Up Style" got boring real fast. Don't get me wrong, she's got a good start but I'd like to see a little more work in some of the songs. Half the songs you don't know if their a dance song or ballad which is bad at dances cause you don't know whether to slow dance or get your groove on. Borrow this from a friend and decided if you like it before you buy.
1,I had gotten Annie Lennox's Christmas Cornucopia and almost died of ecstatic enraptured wonder, and rather than assigning all the credit to the artistry and vision of Annie Lennox, I supposed that maybe I was just a sucker for Christmas Music.  So I got all the Christmas Music I could find, and much of it was not bad.  For Rank Badness only one CD shone out.  Aimee Mann's "Just Another Drifter in the Snow", so cynical and bitter that one fears that Ms. Mann has come to thoroughly believe all her own Market-niche balderdash - that disgusted, disgruntled, sarcastic and sardonic People would simply love to have their own taste in Christmas Music, making it an odd curio for what must be a new low for our collapsing Civilization. She has obviously given up on any `Rescue'. Oh, don't get me wrong! I love Aimee Mann... or I guess I used to. It is true her other CDs are beginning to pile up dust - since the horrible taste of her Christmas Album hasn't really gotten out of my mouth yet, I really haven't had the hankering to play any of her other `stuff'.
1,Cash MOney, if BG and Juvenile left, WTF u still hav their tracks on ur thang?????
1,I did not like some of the songs on hear sorry eminent but I enjoyed other records that he made that to me we're better
1,I relish every Daniel Harding performance except this one.  Some of it is the over-reverberant ambience that makes Beethoven sound more distant and grandiose than intimate.  The orchestra sounds more romantic than classical.  The tempos are too slow, and the phrasing is not sharp and to the point.  Beethoven is never languid.	Feh.
1,The replacement CD came with the same problem. It skips track 1. Its no good. Manufacturing quality problem.
1,Korn has already officially released one greatest hits album and that is it.  Do not purchase this album as the songs are edited (no cuss words) and we have already heard this playlist a countless number of times.  Any Korn fan will have already purchased their albums and have these songs.  If anything, go back and purchase Greatest Hits Vol. 1 as it comes with two cover songs and a remix of Freak On A Leash.  Don't support Sony trying to make even more money off of Korn's music and don't support selling edited music only.
1,Nelly you are a disgrace, I keep hearing comments like "Oh this album is original" or "His flow is smooth", why? because his voice is unique? So what? His lyrics are crap pure and simple no meaning behind them except for the usual mainstream "bling bling" and ... attitude.  This proves that if you have a unique voice and some good beats you can get all the little supposed hip hop fans to follow you and buy you're album (Cash Money, Master P and about 80% of the rappers in public eye today).... because this is nothing but garbage and fillers.
1,Unfortunately 80s were not good times for Yes at all and this record is the beginning of te downfall period... In this album there are only two good things: the cover by Roger Dean and the first song Machine Messiah... this is it, the rest is just the average rock music, where such great musicians as Chris Squire and Steve Howe played (didn't help a lot either). The absence of Jon Anderson was a great blow of course, so it is not a surprise that the album was not successful... the songs are boring and too long, a very great dissapointment after Going for the One and Tormato...	P.S. I forgot the bonuses, which are rather good... it s interesting to listen to the last tracks what may have come out of Yes if Anderson and Wakeman stayed...
1,When I first heard lead single "Crowded", I was hella excited (or at least somewhate excited) about Jeannie Ortega's debut NO PLACE LIKE BKLYN. Unfortunately, upon the opportunity to hear the album before purchasing it, I can't help but to say not only was I extremely disappointed, I also have to say this is one of the worst albums I have heard so far this year.  I don't like to trash any artist unfairly, but this debut should've been so much better and it falls into the cliche where the lead single is not only the best track on the entire album but also the only truly competent performance.		Usually, even an album that has bad tracks can stand on its own to an extent where production is concerned.  That again is not the case on NO PLACE LIKE BRKLYN.  Sure, "Crowded" is a production standout as well as the standout track and even the overproduced "Pay It" has an irresistable synth line, but otherwise, everything seems to fall into the "overproduced" territory. Also the genre that this album seeks to attack is unclear. You get the feeling that Hollywood Records (the wrong label for R&B, period) is trying to aim Ortega as a crossover artist.  Unfortunately, that never comes off with NO PLACE LIKE BKLYN. Sure, there is a mesh of R&B, "reggaeton", pop, adult alt. pop/rock (via. "So Done"), but it never as a whole gels.  The worst tracks have to be the "reggaeton" ones which not only sound the same but are the most overproduced of any tracks here.		What else flaws this album is that Ortega for the most part doesn't have an impressive voice.  After the exceptional opening track and lead single "Crowded" (which Ortega sounds very good on, harking on great), along with the overproduction Ortega's coarse vocals fall off as well. She manages on the somewhat fun "Pay It" and even carries herself on track "So Done", but otherwise Ortega never achieves vocal perfection.  Many times, you feel that Ortega is going to give more and she falls short;  in other words, there is a "remnant" of a memorable, well rounded R&B performance. Also, for R&B to be Ortega's overall genre for the album, she doesn't emote the raw emotion or essence of R&B music.  Even pop (which has an urban aspect as well) calls for certain vocal aerobics and nuances that color the performance.  Ortega stretches out a bit at times, but not enough to impress.		I mention "Crowded" often because "Crowded" is the blueprint for what all of NO PLACE LIKE BKLYN should've been.  Papoose proves that he could be a devastating artist in the rap world with his killer verse.  Ortega sounds on "Crowded" the best that she will sound on the entire album, which is very unfortunate and disappointing.  "Pay It" isn't a bad, bad track, but it is overproduced with too many synthesizer loops and overall uninspired songwriting.  The chorus is catchy of course, and Ortega sounds OK here.  "Green I'z" is one of the first uninspired attempts at reggae/reggaeton.  It fails miserably and leaves you the listener with a feeling of "so what?" "Can U", track 4 brings the third rap collaboration of the album, too many only 4 tracks into the album.  Also, with the exception of the standout performance of Papoose on "Crowded", the rap cameos just don't enhance already bland performances.  "Can U" does tend to be average compared to more mediocre tracks with very cool brass falls contained within the production. Within the first half of the album, "So Done" is the last track that has at least some potential to be a great track.  While it is average, it is also out of place because you don't expect an adult-alt pop/rock song on an R&B based album or even a pop based album.  It probably is in the long run the second or third strongest track on BKLYN.		The second half of the album sinks the already sunken ship. There is truly nothing that stands out.  Production continues to sink with reggae/reggaeton disasters "Let It Go" and the extremely long (5 minutes) and painfully repetitive "It's R Time".  "It's R Time" is clearly the worst track on the album.  "What I Need", "Bling", and "Hear Me" are also floptastic, though not nearly as bad as "It's R Time".  The last track, "Don't Stop" isn't good, but it is better than everything else in the second half of the album and Ortega even sounds a bit better here.		Overall, there are a ton of things wrong with not only NO PLACE LIKE BKLYN and Ortega herself.  First of all, Hollywood is not the choice record company for R&B influence/pop albums;  Hollywood is best for marketing adult-alt pop, teen-pop like standouts Jesse McCartney and Hilary Duff.  In other words, Ortega may have been better served at another label. Next, Ortega  herself needs to work vocally to mature as an artist; she isn't quite ready to be a recording artist as NO PLACE LIKE BKLYN evidences.  Third, next time around if there is a next time, Ortega needs better more competent producers because the production work here seems very generic and below par.  Therefore, I cannot give this album a satisfactory rating.  Better luck next time Jeannie.  1.5 stars.
1,OK...So i admit that even though Hoobastank is really poppy and NOT a rock band that i actually kinda liked their first CD.  Then i heard "The Reason" about a million times on the radio and saw it on MTV about the same.  And I want to know "WHAT"S THE CATCH?"  The other songs are just as bad - thank God they weren't played as much as "The Reason."  The lyrics are whiny and lame, and the riffs and chorus's aren't catchy in the least.  Whoever gave this CD a plus rating doesn't understand music or is deff because this CD sucks, and I'm upset that lamos sell millions of records because of people that can't appresiate the art of music.  Do me a favor and don't give these sellouts your money by supporting their wannabe pop lyrics.  As an aspiring musician I know that it is extremely difficult to please people to get big.  But they were already big before they made a sorry sophomore effort.  I have lost a lot of respect for this band.  Good luck on try #3 guys.  PEACE!
1,I played this for the first (and probably last) time today and found it a very lugubrious experience. I have 18 recordings of MESSIAH, and this one, unfortunately ranks at the bottom. The conducting is lifeless, and the soloists and Taverner Choir all seem to be just going through the motions. MESSIAH should be a powerful, stirring experience, but that is completely lacking here. There is no emotion, passion, or drama--just a few (barely) smoldering embers, as no one here ever catches fire. I've heard Emma Kirkby, David Thomas and James Bowman in much better form on other recordings. The voices here are all "pretty" and the sound quality is good, but that's about it. I don't see how anyone could be satisfied with this recording of MESSIAH. The soloists and chorus here couldn't sound any more bored and detached if they were singing the phone book. Even at the low price, I definitely would not recommend this recording except to Handel fanatics like myself who have nearly 20 recordings of MESSIAH.
1,Relative late-comers to the Thrash Metal elite, Testament dropped a vicious, thundering classic of a debut before gradually spiralling into a vortex of mediocrity over their next few records.  Objectively, 'The New Order' is a pretty decent follow-up.  The production is clearer and crunchier and the song-writing and performances are almost as strong.  Nevertheless, this record has none of the intensity and youthful enthusiasm that makes 'The Legacy' special.		'Disciples of the Watch' is the only truly classic moment here - a Thrash masterpiece and one of the band's finest ever moments.  Most of the rest of the album sounds self-conscious and contrived, the only time the band sound like they're having any fun is on the decent Aerosmith cover.  If you judge this type of music on riffs and solos then it is probably worth purchasing, look elsewhere if you crave urgency and spark.  Either way, get 'The Legacy' first.
1,I heard "Chances" on the Blind Side soundtrack and knew immediately that is was just another Colplay ripoff with dumb cliche lyrics.  The way he sings up high?  Come on.	It has no poignancy at all.  The best it can hope for is a little schlocky catchiness.
1,Huge fan of Dear, particularly more with his 'dance' stuff, but have loved all the solo releases nonetheless. Have come to expect nothing but great solid production.		This album was UNLISTENABLE! Could not sit through one single full track! Yuck!!!
1,Vocals: GAAAAAAAAHHHWAGAGOGAAAAAAAGAWAGAAAHHH!!!DAAAAABADASOSADABABA!!! That's how the vocals sound like. Hope you enjoy this album...		Lyrics: Fu**ing hilarious, in a bad way! The lyrics consist of, "This is gay! You suck! You own a store! You're a c***!" Stupidity at its finist!		Guitar: The guitarist just strums random chords and luckily he doesn't solo.		Bass: No bass heard at all.		Drums: The drummer just beats the sh** out of the drums and has no sense of rhythem at all!		Conclusion: THIS BAND SUCKS!!!
1,Sorry, that title is cheesy. I bought this cd thinking that these songs might be alright, but only two of them are decent. And the DVD doesn't seem to be over 80 minutes to me. More like thirty or forty. HUGE letdown to me. And I buy everything Psychopathic. This shouldn't have been released in my opinion.
1,With this out of the way maybe a best of album of the Soul Asylum that actually changed people's lives can be made so those who think this second rate placebo is good can finally hear the real deal.	I suggest something like:	Freeway	Cocaine BLues	Nowhere to go	Goin' Down	Sexual Healing	One Tin Soldier	Freaks	Carry On	No Man's Land	Crashing Down	Judge	Sun Don't Shine	Closer to the Stars	Never Too Soon	Miracle Mile	Lap of Luxury	Passing Sad Daydream	Draggin Me Down	Voodoo Doll	Stranger	Do You Know	Sick Of That Song	Religiavision	Broken Glass	Masquerade	Happy	Tied To The Tracks	Ship Of Fools	Can't Go Back	Another World, Another Day	Made To Be Broken	Never Really Been	Whoa!	New Feelings	Growing Pain	Long Way Home	Lone Rider	Ain't That Tough	Don't It (make your troubles seem small)	Just Plain Evil	Chains	Secret no More	Artificial Heart	P-9	Take it to the Root	Down on up to Me	Little Too Clean	Sometime to Return	Beggars and Choosers	Endless Farewell	Standing in the Doorway	Marionette	Ode	Jack of All Trades	Twiddly Dee	Heavy Rotation	Spinnin'	Bitter Pill	Veil of Tears	Nice Guys (Don't Get Paid)	Something Out of Nothing	Grounded	Be on Your Way	All the King's Friends	Basically, what people need to hear is a boxed set that begins with Time's Incinerator up until Hang time (with about half of the Horse they rode in on thrown in)and a handful of the best covers they did along the way.	Ultimately the downfall may be summed up by "the harder that it sparkles the more it can corrupt."	If that line means nothing to you...you may not want to bother since you have been sold a string of pearls.
1,Maybe it was voted in by the 'Grannies'.  You would really, really, really, really have to like midtempo faux 70's disco music to like this album.  And really except for a few tracks, it's pretty bland.  I originally heard this album a few months ago.  Should the Grammy's really be about a 70's disco imitation band anyhow?  I suppose the thing is, a couple albums get 'nominated' wink wink, and then the voters can only choose from those 'nominated' albums.  Quite a shock!
1,I don't Like it. This album is too slow and Mellow for me. As I always say I need it pumpin', jumpin', Bossa Nova or Smooth Jazz the rest I'll let it Pazz me hasta La bye Bye.
1,Not really sure what Weezy was thinkin when he did this, but please stick with rapping, and get rid of thaat darn auto tune, please stay with rapping cause you are the best rapper and let the rock stars do the rock music
1,2 1/2		The kind of heavy alternative pop that is modestly ambitious in its limited compositions, eventually coming across more contrived than catchy or compelling for the discerning listener despite winning moments.
1,Stratovarius is one of those rare bands that not only deserve ridicule, but invite it. In this review, I will carefully catalogue their shortcomings as musicians and artists. Hence I present ten reasons why Stratovarius is a band more horrible than you can imagine.	(But first, a bit of background for the uninitiated. Stratovarius is a power metal band from Europe. Uh, yeah.)	(1) Timo Tolkki, the band's guitarist, is unoriginal to the point where his solos sound like the worst, most pointlessly masturbatory moments of Yngwie Malmsteen. What makes him even less original is that he actually seems to recycle the same riffs from song to song, album to album.	(2) The keyboards and guitar solos are fast fast fast, but with nothing in the way of melody or emotion. Guitarists who can spit out 16 measures of 128th notes played flawlessly at breakneck speed are a dime a dozen these days. So, sorry Tolkki, but if you can't do anything _but_ play fast, you aren't so hot, really.	(3) Vocalist Timo Koltipelto, despite being a technically skilled singer, has real problems with English. He winds up placing the accent on the wrong syllable, making already bad lyrics sound worse.	(4) Singing at very high notes, Koltipelto sounds terrible.	(5) The lyrics are insultingly bad. The songs all feature alien grammar and fatuous rhyming that must be Tolkki's idea of poetry. Check out these lines from "4000 Rainy Nights": "These empty days are filling me with pain | After I left it seems my life is only rain [!!] | My heart is longing to the better times | When everything was still so fine [!?!]." Oh, how emotional! Such striking diction, such stirring poetry! My heart is breaking! In all seriousness, I'd rank the lyrics at about the same writing quality as the script for an Italian x-rated movie.	(6) With lyrics that are worse than bad, you are further reminded that Koltipelto is an annoying singer.	(7)The band seems to adhere the exact same drum track to every song. That is, each speedy metal cut is characterized by obnoxious abuse of double-bass drum and senseless whacking of the snare. Combined with reused riffs, fast Stratovarius songs are basically indistinguishable from one another.	(8) The drumming, which is detestable enough as is, is set so loud and overproduced in the mix that it becomes unbearable.	(9) Stratovarius' sense of melody and songwriting sounds suspiciously like bulk-rate AOR or hair metal (a genre that died for a reason).	(10) Sometimes Stratovarius is called "progressive metal." This is just false. Being progressive supplicates a certain degree of originality, which Stratovarius does not possess. They have shown zilch in terms of artistic growth over the course of their careers (which, as of this writing, covers eight studio albums). Okay, so they have a pair of 10-minute songs, but writing long songs is not a progressive quality in and of itself. Anyone considering the purchase of this album because it's been touted as "first-rate progressive metal" should NOT buy this album.	All right, I'll be fair. "Anthem of the World" is a great song...at first. A string section plays a killer riff, which is picked up by the guitar. It's intense, and it sounds killer. But when those pounding, overproduced drums settle in, and Koltipelto starts singing some vile notes, it's finished. I also admire (such a strong word, but I'll use it anyway) the band's sense of optimism and the fact that they certainly enjoy the music they're making. That's really what it's about, isn't it?	Stratovarius, ... You are abject
1,I remember when this first came out and it was lauded as the greatest thing since sliced bread. From a historical standpoint, it came out during the early 1990's "alernative music" rage and critics were looking for artists to champion this new genre.		While there are some interesting ideas and quality melodies, this cd is hurt by the poor production and too short length of the songs. "I am a Scientist", "Hot Freaks" and "Smothered Freaks" could have been so much better with higher quality production.		In defense of GBV, they were truly a indie band and, for all I know, this was the epitome of a do-it-yourself work that was picked up by a label and then distributed.		This was all the rage 20 years ago but there's a reason why you don't hear anything about it today. Perhaps this was a group that could have benefited from the feared commercial	up-grade?
1,Very disappointed not what I thought it was going to be!!!!
1,This band sucks, i bought the album because a magazine i read said they were the next big thing from Napalm records.  WHAT A JOKE!  THIS BAND SUCKS (DROP) D!
1,After buying and listening to And Then There Was X, I quickly decided to  never buy another DMX album again!! This release is a slap in the face to  the entire culture of Hip Hop. It purely exemplifies why Hip Hop is in the  decaying and stagnant state it's in now. The only reason I was able to rate  this album with one star is because of the only two good songs contained on  it, What's My Name and What These B**ches Want. Other than those two songs,  the listener will be in for a disappointing journey over X's preaching and  singing. His best work came clearly on his initial release, It's Dark and  Hell Is Hot. Since then, he has grown substantially worse from album to  album. This is, without a doubt, his worst offering to date. And Then There  Was X can not compete with satisfying Hip Hop releases such as The Life and  Times of S. Carter. The production on this album was lukewarm at it's  height, but basically terrible. Swizz Beats is displaying that his work is  also declining in substance. The best track, as far as production is  concerned, is What These B**ches Want, which was produced by Nokio from the  R&B group Dru Hill. With the release of And Then There Was X and The  Opposite of H2O by Drag-On, the Ruff Ryder camp is proving that it can not  live up to it's early-life hype. I would not recommend this album to  anyone.

1,Sure, the musical stylings may be varied, but the variety on this album can never make up for the fact that the Offspring became soft on this release, and failed to regain their edge seen during their "Smash" days and before.	...Pity
1,The sounds are sugary ear candy for any Sixties addict (nice cover art, as well), but this is not the work of plucky youngsters with a Beatles bent.  These studio hacks have crafted an album that might better be titled "Hey, I just bought a Rickenbacker 12-string; let's try it out."  The melodies and harmonies that we all love are there, but I've heard more heart in a single Oneders b-side (studio musicians all) than the entirety of this disc. There are references aplenty to some wonderful music by the Beatles and XTC, to name but two, but instead of a sly homage, several snippets can be found tone for tone on those artists' songs. And who is this "she" that plays such a large role in the lyrics throughout?  All we know about her is that she is female and elicits a reaction that we also learn nothing about. Pleasant listening, but it's been done better.
1,This recording annoyed and surprised me.  I don't understand how anyone could think these sweet pretty piano pieces need big orchestrations.  The lovely melodies get lost. No more need be said.
1,If there is one thing that I don't understand, its Metallica fans. I don't understand why a band who people couldn't stand in the 1980's, suddenly became everyones favorite band. Let me explain my theroy on this album and why I think that everyone's excuse of changing direction is a bunch of crap. Metallica actually began to change direction somewhat in 1988. When they released "And Justice for All" it would be Jason Newsteads first full length album with the band, and I am sure the pressure was on because he has some big shoes to fill with Cliff Burton passing away just a few yrs before. When And Justice came out, you could hear that there was a bit of difference from the other three albums. It wasn't that much slower then the other 3, but a bit more polished (for the time) and the songs seemed a bit more complex. It actually took me awhile to really appricate the album, as it just didn't really hit a nerve when I picked it up in 1988, Yet, after many listens, it grew on me, and I realized that the band was maturing and they were going to go in a bit of a diffrent musicaly direction. When the Black album came out in 1991, I really wasn't thrilled at all, and to this day, its not one of my favorites, yet...I would take it over the LOAD and RELOAD period any day of the week. Even though the Black album seemed more radio friendly, and the songs really slowed down, it still was Metal. And yes I like all music types, but you are what you are. Metallica was a great Metal band, when they decided to sell out for Load and REload, I lost all respect. This album is terrible. I love all music, it doesnt have to be thrash metal for me to enjoy it, yet when you want to go in a different direction, it doesnt mean changing your entire style of music to sell more albums...I mean lets take the Band Bolt Thrower for example..For those that aren't familer with them, they are a death/doom Metal band out of England. The first two releases were lightning fast, I mean fast...Yet the newer material, (they have been around since 1988) has slowed down tremediously..YET, it is still heavy and it is still Metal. I don't understand LOAD, and maybe if it wasn't Metallica that did it, it might be a better album (it would have been much better if a band like Pearl Jam or Creed would have put something out like Load) Anyway, one more point I would like to make is that why do some many hate the new album. Everyone who said that they were experimenting with a new musical concept said it was alright during the Load period..YET when it comes to ST. Anger everyone is sooo disappointed with it...Its to noisy, Lousy production, Lars drums soound like Tin Cans...COMe on..First offf, I think St. ANger is a really good album. Its got some really crunchy riffs, and it seems like they are going back to their metal roots. Is it as good as RIde the Lightning..Hell no...but it shows that they cared more about the music then the money (hey the CD barley got any airplay) Think about what you say when you review....Do you really really like the old Metallica, do you really like Metal, or where you just infactuated with a sub-par rock album from a bunch of sellouts
1,To quote him se said:		"Wow...I mean, WOW...everyone's complaining about how horrible pop music is...and I mean EVERYONE...so why is it burning up the pop charts? I mean, I turned off my radio and have been avoiding MTV for at least three years now, but one day I heard this song at a school function, and everyone was dancing to it so me and a few buddies started retard dancing as well. So after the dance some girl, a friend of mine, but a very musically ignorant girl, approached me, looked at my Dark Tranquillity shirt and asks, "why do you listen to that scary music?" This was a girl who started squealing when they played this song at the gym. So I'll tell you all what the answer is: because Dark Tranquillity is a band who can play their instruments, who don't play other people's songs, who don't rely on dance moves to cover up for shoddy musicianship, who write songs with meaning and power; the Pussycat Dolls...well, the band name really says it all. They're disposabl. Is anyone gonna remember this song when the next big MTV smash comes out? Probably not. Pop is disposable, but those who know nil of music eat it up anyway. Now, Simple Plan has more talent than this, ahem, "band". At least they ATTEMPT to play and write quality songs (though they fail miserably). Bands that have real talent, that build a fan base by constant touring, making barely enough money to eat off of, living in a van while on tour, all for the love of music, and nothing but the pure, honest dedication to music are listed below:		Mastodon, In Flames, Childen of Bodom, Shadows Fall, Lamb of God, Meshuggah, Novembers Doom, Avenged Sevenfold, CKY, Susperia, The Gathering, Kovenant, and so many more. Support true talent."		You're 101% right, keep up the good work comrad. For good maninstream music, listen to Velvet Revolver. for good music in general, just listen to any band watty wrote down.		Death to Kitten Wh**e Dolls!
1,intended to be annoying, it is said. it is rather hostile.
1,LOVE KRIS AND HAVE ALWAYS  LOVED HIS TALENT, ESPECIALY HIS SONG WRITING AND ACTING.  BUT HE DOESN'T SING AS WELL AS HE DID IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS.

1,Nick Colionne has worked his guitar fingers to a spot where he is a major player in the smooth jazz game.	This project sounds like he went back to the beginning. I listened to this project twice and only one song " Some Funky" is the best song on this project. I don't think I can listen to this a third time all the way through.	Just cause you feel the urge to sing don't mean you should. Don't know why guitar players now want to step into George Benson's area and start singing. There is only one that has them kind of chops, George Benson.	Now don't get me wrong I have everyone of Nick's cds but this is one of his most disappointing cd he has put out. Sounds of a cow in pain is not what I call quality singing. Nick stick to playing and leave the singing to someone that can.	As for the the rest of the project the songs have no pop to them, not like "Flyin' High" or any other songs he has done over the years. Not cool man, not cool at all.
1,Given the current configuration of Jimi Hendrix's catalog, I am not sure why this album was reissued.  Besides the obvious reason.	The first two songs are the same two songs that begin the fairly recent Wild Blue Angel live album, which I love. Most of the remaining tracks, including such highlights as Blue Suede Shoes and Johnny B. Goode, can be found on the Jimi Hendrix Experience box set.  The Hendrix family prepared that box set and it is still in print. Well I guess that the live version of Fire is not on the box set, anyways.  Some people are grousing about the lack of the Royal Albert Hall live songs on this reissue.  But those versions are on the box set.		My venn diagram of Hendrix fans reveals that 60% of the people who care about such details already own the box set.  You can make your own Live in the West from the box set.  Of course, the songs on this album are great and the remastering sounds good.  But the only excuse for the existence of this CD, besides money or nostalgia for the posthumous releases of the early 70s, is to serve as a collection of greatest live moments.  However, I would not advise noobies to start here.  While the material is all good, its not necessarily a collection of the greatest moments.  Second, contrary to other reviewers, I don't think the album sounds like a show or even a series of shows at one venue.  It sounds somewhat disjointed.  If you don't own any live Hendrix, I would start with the single disc Winterland or Fillmore (or Wild Blue Angel) (for the later period). With each of those releases, you get a better sense of each band, the flow of a Hendrix live set, where Hendrix was at as an artist at the time and the atmosphere of being there.  If you already own those albums, then just go ahead and get the box set - you are a big Hendrix fan after all.		If they reissued this grab bag, I am sure that Cry of Love, War Heroes, and Crash Landing won't be far behind...........and the circle will be completed with the Hendrix family now supervising the reissuing of the albums they previously deemed unworthy.
1,STRIP DOWN TO YOUR PANTIES & IT'S CONSIDERED  CUTTING EDGE.  TEST OF A GOOD "ARTIST" (singer, comedian, actor)  IS, CAN YOU PERFORM WITHOUT RESORTING TO BEING DIRTY.  MOST MODERN ARTISTS CANNOT.  JUST LOOK AT RAP MUSIC, THAT'S AN EXAMPLE.  CYRUS IS NO EXCEPTION.
1,Great smooth jazz with a saxophone melodic tone.
1,Seller was very professional, item came quickly. -- However, DO NOT BUY THIS- It has been "edited", in other words, censored. I failed to read the entire description, so I literally paid the price. -- I wouldn't want a painting that's got a black box over half of it and I don't want a Rap album with tons of words cut out by someone. Another shiny coaster...
1,Most inexperienced listeners will say they like deftones, simply because they've heard the tracks from "The Crow" and "The Matrix" sound tracks.  That's where I used to be: among the many.  Now  I'm part of the universe that has actually spent money on a real deftones  cd.  The shove it and fly away songs rock, but the rest just EATS IT.  I  could seriously make music that's just as good, although I'd have to work  on my voice for about 2 seconds.  Ha!  For those of you who have already  bought this cd, do what I did:  Ask a friend who hasn't heard very much  deftones to "temporarily" trade this cd for one of his/hers.  Then never give the good cd of their's back!  Mwahaha!  Just have patience,  and your time will come.
1,Only buy this compact disc if you really want the songs and the collection makes sense to you after reading the list of titles. There is nothing special here. The masters are litereally "off-the-shelf" and all  but a very few are repeats from other compilations including the mistakes!  Como fans will have virtually all of these songs and for new Como fans, the  suggestion that these are his "Greatest Hits" is clearly a  misrepresentation having only three songs here from the last 40 years! Even  as an early collection of Perry's first 15 years with RCA Victor, the set  is certainly not definitive. These new kids at BMG should take time out to  meet Perry Como and then, perhaps, they would treat his recorded legacy  with a little more respect!
1,There is only one decent song on this album.  The same one that will hook 90% of us that buy this CD.  After a couple of listens to the rest of the disc all I can say is that Mr. Jules has a great ear for interpretating others work, but he will soon be stuck on the coffee house circuit once again.
1,If you know early My Bloody Valentine, you'll do the recordshop equivalent to the walk of shame (i.e. to the "sell back" counter) after you've heard this dreck just the once.		There just aren't any truly memorable songs here--they may be "catchy," but you won't, I don't think, be caught up in what The Pains do.		Try these instead:  THE BLACK WATCH, "icing the snow queen"; THE CHURCH, "untitled #23"; or any of the latest stuff WIRE has put out...		Ecstacy and wine, Hillary.
1,Not even producer Terry Manning's Bahamas- based Compass Point Studios could salvage this "train-wreck" of a CD. Eight of "E2A"'s selections are forgetable songs the band performed on their 2005 Tour. Second Skin( 24 times), Goodpeople(23 times), Solid Rock-a Dylan cover-(16 times), Time Zones(16 times), When the C(l)ow(n)s Come Home(17 times), Ribs and Whiskey(37 times)- which was first performed way back on 11/90, You Should Be Glad(24 times) and May Your Glass Be Fiiled(15 times). So their loyal fan based- "spreadheads"- have already heard this material. Creativity and originaltiy are tossed out the window. If this is the best the band has to offer, maybe they should to talk to their financial consultants- retirement is straight ahead.
1,Performance: businesslike and direct - expect no subtlety or depth and you will be satisfied. Gramophone called it "fresh": is that a code?		Orchestra: when will the VPO raise its game and play like one of the great orchestras of the world? After all that is what we are consistently told and I fail to hear with their lazy stilted playing. Here they sound nothing like world class.		Sound and recording: the non-digital recordings of Symphonies 3 and 5 sound boomy with artificial synthetic strings - a Moorfoot tendency that could be effectively tamed on vinyl, but is ever-present on this CD re-mastering. The early digital recordings are just dreadful. Digital in 1979: are you joking? It is like booking a steam train from London to Vienna!  Incredibly inferior and dated. God knows what the LPs sounded like.		From the early 1970s Decca recordings went downhill - the glory days of that label were definitely in the 1960s - conversely, recordings from EMI steadily improved during the 1970s from a poor start in the 1960s.		Try: Chandos / Weller for performance and digital sound as it should sound or, if you want to be guided by the "critics" Abbado on DG, but to my ears it sounds just as bad as this Decca disc. Another option is to back track in the catalogue to Kurt Masur's acclaimed recordings for Eterna and Philips from the heart: the Leipzig Gewandhaus.		No grudges: Dohnanyi can conduct great Mendelssohn live, as I have witnessed with the Philharmonia in London - one of the reasons I bought this. Hence my disappointment. Perhaps he will do the whole cycle again with them, but this time - - - - PROPERLY!
1,This CD was a popular alternative to Bowie's thinly-mixed version of Raw Power for many years, but now that Iggy's superior sounding re-mixed Raw Power is out there really is no need to buy this CD unless you are a  diehard collector. The first seven songs (same sequence as the Raw Power CD  minus Shake Appeal) sound good, but the numerous alternate takes are  horrible sounding. Buy the re-mixed Raw Power instead, and if you're  curious about the alternate takes, check out the Studio Sessions CD - three  of the alternate takes appear here as well as other outtakes from the Raw  Power recording sessions - it's a much more interesting CD.
1,This solo effort by Walter Becker showcases alot of what he brought to Steel Dan's music.  The rhythms from the guitars and drums are quite funky in a slightly unusual way.  The special effects particularly on Hard Up  Case, Lucky Henry, and Hat Too Flat are quite interesting.  However, most  of the songs are very identical in song structure and style.  Most of the  songs consist of a few chords usually with the same progression repeated  over and over again.  Pretty annoying after a while.  In addition, Walter  seems to sing each song in the same manner.  Furthermore, most if not all  the songs seems to have a sleazy overtone to it.  Just read the titles.  After a while, this can really drain on any listener.  There are a few  worthwhile cuts(Down At The Bottom, Junkie Girl, Hat Too Flat, Book Of  Liars) and a few good moments here and there among the remaining eight  tracks.  However, when compared to any of Steely Dan or Donald Fagen  recordings, it rates as its title suggests.
1,DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS MUSIC ONLY
1,Since 1998, VH-1 has made it a very huge event for its annual Divas Live concerts. Sincerely, the televised concerts make it an absolute joy and rapture to watch them every single time. Surprisingly, I wish I could say the exact same thing for the live albums that are released the exact same way. Since 1998, the channel VH-1 has flawed the live records for themselves. Ironically, this is just the third Divas Live album that was released to the public. It had remained absent from the public for a few years, with taped tributes to Diana Ross and Aretha Franklin. Still, the experience is still something or other.	The 2002 edition of Divas Live was shot in Las Vegas, for the very first time, instead of New York City, where the Divas Live concerts were previously held. On this show, the divas come out, but with much fewer tracks this time than the other Divas concerts. Still, there were some very good performances including Celine Dion's wonderful song, A New Day Has Come, Cher's Song For The Lonely and Believe. Ironically, Cher performed it at the Divas Live '99 edition, but it wasn't released on the 1999 Divas Live concert album. There was also another newcomer that knocked down the house, Anastacia. Her song One Day In Your Life took off overseas first, than nearly took about a year to make it into the American shores.	Still, when I said there were some flaws, I can absolutely tell when a diva's performance in general was shut out. The case in point is from Mary J. Blige, who performed a couple of her hit songs at the Divas concert from her album No More Drama, the title track, No More Drama, and Rainy Dayz. That was a knockout performance within itself, but how could they release an album like that and shut down a divas perofrmance. Make that 2 divas together. Whitney Houston made a surprise appearance during Rainy Dayz, which made the crowd go absolutely crazy.	When VH-1 makes the concerts a joy live, it is quite alright. Sadly, they really need to try harder to really make better live albums. This time, the Divas Live was taken to a big blow. Instead, I suggest you buy the original Divas Live and Divas Live '99 concerts on CD. They were much better the first two times around.
1,Pearl Jam even more than Nirvana was te difinative rock band from the eraly 90s. Every thing from the look, to the quasi social messages many of their songs contained define the eraly 90s. The biggest irony, is that with Ten and even Vs., they were by far the most conventional sounding of the "grunge" bands. Ten was a brillant hard rock album, one of the best hard rock recordings ever. And the music on Ten is timeless, it could have come out in 75,85 or even in 2001. Vs. is somwhat rougher edged, less refined than Ten, but still a excellent effort. Then comes Vitology, when Vedder starts to take further control, and when the politics, such as Pearl Jams fights againts commercialisim and ticket master take a toll on their music. Also, the timlessness of their material started to fade. Ever since Vs. Pearl Jams sound and image has been stuck in the early 90s. The band ceased being a and in the true sense, and become a Vedder solo band. Vitalogy,No Code, Yeild and BinAural all sound like they were recorded in the 93-94 time period.	  No Code, to put it bluntly, is trash. Yes, the consideriable talent is still there, but sadly Vedder runs the whole show. Not even new drummer Jack Irons considerable talent shines on this album, while Ament, Gossard and McCready are held back. The somng writing on No Code is a sloppy mess, meandering from Neil Young style electric folk rock to neo punk to sloppy Zep style hard rock to their laughable attempt at world beat. All and all, a complete failure to execute any of these styles.		If one is a Vedder fanatic, No Code is the album for them, but if one is simpily a fan of rock music, avoid No Code. No I am obviously am not a fan of Pearl Jam, and other people who write reviews will throw the "you don't understand" line out. But I am a fan of rock music, and to people who are simpily fans of good rock music, who read these reviews trying to get a idea of what to buy and not to buy, sadly you won't find it here with this album.
1,OK... I don't get it. I always thought that I'd adore Mott. Quite honestly, all I'd heard was All The Young Dudes, but I'm a complete Bowie fanatic and have been for a good 20 years. Being that I was only 3, though, when Mott had their heyday, all I'd known was All The Young Dudes. Still, they had everything right going for them, and their reputation was excellent. Plus the majority of the Bowie-produced All The Young Dudes album is here, plus nearly all of their other acclaimed albums, Mott and The Hoople.		Wow. What a disappointment. Maybe you had to be there when this was big, but I would say upwards of 80 percent of this is just horrible. Bad Dylany impersonations, dumb lyrics (they've milked the words "ballad/hymn" and "dudes" for all they are worth) and (because of Mick Ralphs involvement) -- worst of all -- too much macho Bad Co.-inspired boring rock.		No spark here, aside from All The Way to Memphis, ATYD, Sea Diver, their version of Sweet Jane and maybe Whizz Kidd.		REVISION: I like this. It's not fantastic, but it's good. I just had to spend some time w/ it. I'd rate it three and a half stars at this point. I Wish I Was Your Mother and Ballad of Mott are amazing songs. In fact, pretty much everything from the Mott album is fantastic (except Violence). There's definitely a good single CD here -- two CDs is a bit much, but I Wish I Was Your Mother isn't on the single greatest hits CD, so you'd have to buy that plus the Mott album. Or this and shave off what you don't like.
1,I'm not feeling it..he not saying nothing new and the beats sound wacky and bubbagum like (POP)If you like simple lyrics and you just like the club music vibe, well this CD is just for you....
1,I liked Crazy Heart and I think Jeff Bridges did a nice job on that soundtrack but that disc had help from others like Townes Van Zandt, Waylon Jennings, and Buck Owens. This cd featueres just Bridges with some backup vocalists and while the music isn't awful, it is lackluster. The opening track "What A Little Bit of Love Can do" and the closing track "The Quest" are the best on the CD.  "Maybe I missed the point" is pretty good. The others are just ok.  The problem is that this cd is filled with very slow ballads sung by a baritone and unless a baritone is a great one, music by a baritone is prone to be melancholy and boring.  There's no life to most of the songs. This does beg the question "can almost anyone who can carry a tune can sing country music".  Maybe but not necessarily good country music.  If I want to hear good country male artists, why listen to Jeff Bridges when there are singers like Brad Paisley, Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw or even new comers like Justin Moore.  I pulled the 3 good songs off of this cd and mixed them with the Crazy Heart Soundtrack and now that cd is really good.
1,This is a Kansas album that should never have happened. Drastic Measures, released in 1983, was not a good effort by Kansas. Kerry Livgren, one of the main songwriters for Kansas, had lost interest and contributed very little to this album. Robby Steinhardt, the band's violinist, was gone. And, with the exception of the final two tracks, it just didn't sound like Kansas. John Elefante, who replaced Steve Walsh on vocals after Audio Visions, was leading the band now and he made them sound like a cross between Journey, Loverboy and Foreigner. Now if this was a new band or a solo project by Elefante, that wouldn't have been bad. As a Kansas album, though, it only took away from this idea of what Kansas music was.	Fight Fire With Fire is actually a great power rock song. It doesn't sound like Kansas in the least, but, really, neither did Dust in the Wind or Hold On when they came out. This is the best song on the record.	The second track, Everybody's My Friend, is not very good. It's best to skip.	Next, Mainstream, the first song penned by Livgren, is pretty good, although it also doesn't sound much like Kansas. It has some very small "prog" moments, like the middle interlude, but is more or less a straight-forward rock song.	Andi is aweful, both lyrically and musically. I thought if I forced it down my ears long enough it would grow on me, but it hasn't. Skip this one, too.	Going Through the Motions, by Elefante and his brother, is one of the best Elefante songs on any Kansas album. It's my second favorite song on this album (behind Fight Fire With Fire), but, once again, just doesn't have that Kansas sound.	The next song, Get Rich, is ho-hum. It doesn't stand out but it doesn't distract too much either. I think Elefante was trying to make a prog-rock song, but it just isn't that good. I won't judge it too harshly, though, because there are some prog-rock attempts on the early Kansas records that didn't turn out well, either.	Don't Take Your Love Away is an alright rock song. It's straight-forward and doesn't have that traditional Kansas sound I keep referring to. In some ways it reminds me of a cross between A Glimpse of Home from Monolith and Relentless from Audio Visions.	Next is End of The Age, the second Livgren-penned song. The keyboard intro reminds me of a sumo wrestler. It's a good song that could have been on Monolith or Audio Visions. By the time Drastic Measures comes around in 1983 it sounds a little dated. Even so, it's good to hear a little of that "Kansas" sound we all love so much.	Finally, Incident on a Bridge, another Livgren song, closes the album. It also has a more traditional Kansas sound and would have sounded great on Monolith. Like the previous track, it sounds a bit dated in 1983, but, compared to much of the record, it sounds like a glass of cool water on a hot day.	If this had been John Elefante's solo record or perhaps the first Mastedon (Elefante's next band) project, it would've been pretty good, for the most part. As a Kansas album, well, it just doesn't sound much like Kansas and the little that does sound like Kansas is somewhat behind the times, not forward thinking like their earlier work.	Those of us who can't get enough Kansas will purchase this for a few songs that will get played every once in a while. Those Elefante fans out there (you know who you are) will play it over and over again. Those who love 80's rock will find it interesting, but won't think it's any better than what Journey and Foreigner were doing at that time.	It's too bad the name Kansas is on the front cover.
1,I am not feeling the album all like that, I like a few tracks off of it, but it just does not grasp me! I have bought all of Kanye's albums and my favorites were Graduation and Late Registration. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is weak too me, my favorite track on the album is "SO APPALLED!" I just think that Kanye gets a lot of exposure and it is all a HYPE! This album is a flop just like Nikki Minaj new album, don't waste yall money for those who haven't listened to it yet, I would suggest burning it from someone or getting a bootleg of it! I have been listening to HIP-HOP for a long time, this album is not HOT!
1,Had this latest piece of garbage show up as ad's in youtube video's of was watching of real artists and the pieces of each song I heard sound the same as every other piece of garbage this poser hack has relesed or had written for him.  Why the hell is his metal saluting the ocean on the cover?  Hopefully lightning struck him seconds after he did some that stupid.....take back the horns from these polished, shat out manufacutred turds.
1,It's my opinion that these girls, who have an awesome sound, should have spent more time writing new, fresh songs instead of butchering the traditional songs through their misinterpretation.  To me, this compilation came across as being a quick opportunity to earn some bucks instead of really trying to showcase the talent this group has.  In a lot of cases, you can't even tell that this is supposed to be a CD made to celebrate Christmas.  A few even sound a little like a trip to Hades.  I love their SheBang CD and looked forward to their harmonies in this one. I was sorely disappointed.
1,paranoid android and creep are both awesome songs, but i didn't like any of the other songs on here.  i always heard karma police was cool, but i didn't really like it.
1,Stu Block is a good replacement, but the songs just aren't there. It's pretty mediocre. The lyrics are horrible. Go back to writing about Set Abominae, that seems to make this band more inspired.
1,I just don't get this record. I picked it up used two days ago for $3.95 so I knew I wasn't risking much. Someone had a copy of it at work when it came out in 2004 and I heard it just one time. I didn't like it then and on hearing it all the way through again yesterday I still don't like it. It's either: A. Too symphonic and orchestrated or B. Just plain silly..........a song about vegetables? That must have been written in one of Wilson's dark periods, and of course there have been many.		In fairness to Wilson, as far as I'm concerned, he's made a very stunning and tremendous comeback. I just saw him last week and was just completely knocked out by the show. But I just don't see that his later writing compares to anything he did in the 60's or early 70's. FYI they did very little from Smile last week. Granted, there are a few good tunes on Smile: Heroes and Villains, Surf's Up, Good Vibrations. The version here of Good Vibrations, however, pales in comparison to the original single released circa 1967. There's a LOT of music on Smile and other than those three tunes it just bores me to tears. All the hoopla about Wilson finally completing his follow-up to Pet Sounds? The hoopla was not justified, at least not to this listener, and this record in no way even comes close to Pet Sounds.
1,I loved the original Sabbath line-up of Osbourne, Iommi, Butler and Ward. I have heard every studio album countless times. I consider each to be recommended listening for anyone even remotely interested in hard rock/heavy metal.	How does "Past Lives" fit in with rest of the Sabbath pantheon? My answer would be to consider "Past Lives" after you have exhausted all of their studio work. Basically, you have to be a dyed-in-the-wool Sabbath freak to get any value from this set. If you are anything less than that, you may come away somewhat disappointed. For everyone else, I would consider the album to be a curiousity in the Sabs discography, but hardly an essential purchase.	A lot of "Past Lives" is tinny, trashy, and bootleg-sounding. If you're expecting a pristine sounding live document, be forewarned: the sound and production values aren't exactly major-label quality. (This is probably why it's being put out by Divine Records, Ozzy and Sharon's vanity label.) If you can get past that and also the fact that Disc One is "Live at Last" rehashed in its entirety, it's not too bad of a set. My personal highlights would include the extended jam on Disc One's "Wicked World," "Tomorow's Dream" and "Megalomania" from Disc Two.	The packaging, particularly in the deluxe edition, is very well done. I don't quite understand all the emphasis given to the Cal-Jam photos, given that none of this set is culled from Sabbath's Cal Jam appearance! No matter, at the very least there are lots of cool pictures to look at why you're listening to the studio albums!
1,This is the worst piece of crap I have ever heard. It goes right up there with William Hung "She Bangs" and Oh, I don't know nails on a chalk board. Mountain Man is a great character on Duck Dynasty and seems like a wonderful fella, but he couldn't carry a tune in a bull frog bucket. I have three words that describes this effort, and I quote "Stink , Stank , Stunk"... If you want to waste $10.00 go ahead, but you have been warned and with hope Mountain Man saves his $$ from this cause I don't think anyone will ever offer him another record contract.
1,Do the powers that be really think Green Day fans are going to buy this subpar soundtrack of an embarrassing movie for just one song?! The answer is a resounding NO! Another example of major labels breeding contempt for the music industry as a whole!!
1,I recently bought this Cinema Special Edition CD-DVD combo as a present , this one only came the cd ; I gave it to my mother , so we are going to keep it but was NOT a Combo .
1,Apparently everyone is quite enamored with Norah Jones, as both of her albums are huge sellers - this must mean that she is a talent of monumental proportions, right?  Wrong.  That kind of thinking will only set you up for disappointment.	Critics have spilled so much ink and even find themselves at a loss for words when describing Jones, but the truth of the matter is that her music is just so painfully average and mundane.  They have you believing that Jones is the Second Coming, but hearing this album makes you wonder why - it's so lifeless, glossy, and dull that its only discernable purpose is as safe "listen at work" music, or perhaps background music at a soiree or something.	Jones's style supposedly draws from jazz, country, blues, etc., but there's none of the virtuosity and raw passion that we've comes to associate with these genres of music.  The end result is really just incredibly milquetoast and bland, and the fact that it's so inoffensive is the reason why radio and VH1 are playing it incessantly.  Did I mention that this music was bland?  These are the kind of songs that you forget five minutes after they were played.	Some have complemented Jones by saying that her phrasing and tone sound so familiar.  And that is because it's all been done before!  There's no question that she scores a zero in the originality department - Jones is kind of like Diana Krall, only even less daring.  We haven't even mentioned the cliche-ridden lyrics which drag this recording down even further - "Come away with me and we'll kiss on a mountain top", "I wished that I could fly away ... Catching teardrops in my hand", etc.  Certainly not the material we would expect from such a highly-touted artist.  So she won a few Grammy Awards - so what?  Nowadays the Grammies are nothing more than a popularity contest, with awards presented to the highest selling acts out there.	In summary: Come Away With Me is not the watermark that the media has proclaimed it to be - it's an unspectacular collection of piano-based adult contemporary music.  Norah Jones has been coasting along on her good looks and having a highly accessible sound, but it's also a sound that's lacking in substance.  Maybe one of these days Jones will live up to the hype, but I would recommend that you pass on this album.
1,OK, so Into Eternity are Canadian (lol)... with that in mind, they're good (I guess), but they are so negative. I listen to a lot of metal, and most of it (if not all of it) is negative, but Into Eternity are just trying to fit into the genre, and they are kind of fake. I think that this release would've been awesome without the annoying sing-along style of singing that they embrace to the fullest. The sad part is that on their self titled release, their lead singer sings higher than the chick that is featured in the song... just keep that in mind if you are thinking about buying this CD. I would highly recommend Night in Gales - Nailwork instead of this CD if you want to listen to catchy metal.
1,The Great (although re-packaged!) music saves it from the dreaded one star.	For Casual fans, the two Greatest Hits volumes are all you need, Die-Hards would already own this stuff, possibly a few times over considering the Vinyl/Cassette and 8 Track formats and re-purchasing on CD.	Box Sets are supposed to contain the right mix of Rarities, Songs that appeared as B-Sides of singles (unreleased on album), and a few demos or alternate takes. Instead we get quite a few live tracks, good, but far from fresh, as it's just a rehashed concept from Hell Freezes over.	Simply put, Selected Works just doesn't merit shelling out more bucks for familiar material, this is true with all Box Sets actually. I've made a conscious effort to avoid 'em. They REEK of Record Company greed, and shows a sign of laziness on the band's part.
1,Dammit I give up. Christ, at least change the band name so people aren't embarrassed to say they like STP. I know the awesomeness of Core and Purple are forever gone, but what's the point of a bunch of aging 90s grunge rockers trying to recreate the 70s? There's so much decent 70s derivative music out there, this ain't it. Even the simple bossa nova ending track was ruined. FAIL
1,Gotta say this album was a huge disappointment listened to all of her records and this album just lacks and flat out blows.
1,Disappointed.  Wanted good, audible recording of You Hold Me Now and what I got was a live concert.
1,Ever since the 1970's,Aerosmith has been one of the most popular rock groups of all time. Are Steven Tyler,Joe Perry,Tom Hamilton,Brad Whitford,and Joey Kramer musical geniuses? Are there too many Aerosmith compilations out there? The answer to the first question is yes they are,and the answer to the second question is yes there is. And is Aerosmith's most recent compilation,GOLD,any good? Read on for my review of this:		This compilation wasn't needed,and even though some compilations from some bands aren't needed doesn't mean that they aren't any good(KISS' GOLD compilation wasn't needed either,but that was actually pretty good). Remember when YOUNG LUST:THE ULTIMATE AEROSMITH ANTHOLOGY was released about two or three years ago,right when the O YEAH! compilation was released? What you have here is a repackage of YOUNG LUST with the original disc one as disc two and the original disc two as disc one--DOES SOMEONE MIND TELLING ME WHY THAT IS???!!! When Geffen Records was getting ready for this compilation to be released,they could have taken Aerosmith's best songs from the 70's,80's,90's,and '00's and used them all for this compilation(I would have preferred a three disc set here,but a two disc set could do a decent job at doing what I already mentioned),and they could have also taken some Aerosmith's classics from both the 70's and 80's that were NOT on O YEAH! and allowed for them to be on this compilation. This compilation only has Aerosmith's material from 1985-1997,so the idiot who was lucky enough to assemble a compilation from one of America's greatest rock bands must have thought it would be funny to irritate loyal Aerosmith fans and leave out Aerosmith's classic 70's material(I like their material from the 80's,90's,and '00s,but I like Aerosmith's 70's material better than their post 70's material,and I am sure most other Aerosmith fans would say the same thing)and just take live versions--not the original studio versions of their classic 70's material--and replace Aerosmith's 70's material with the live versions of a few of their 70's songs from the 90's--and just give recognition to Aerosmith's 70's material that way a few times,leaving out everything else Aerosmith wrote and recorded in the 70's. The music here certainly deserves five stars(without question)but the effort Geffen Records and the compilation producer of this greatest hits package put into it is only worthy of two stars.		Overall,a weak compilation that could have been totally better. If you've been a loyal Aerosmith fan for several years now and you still don't have YOUNG LUST and want to get it,and/or you are an Aerosmith completist and feel the need to have evrything that has the name Aerosmith on it,then I'd say buy this compilation,but otherwise,this compilation is recommended to nobody else. Not even new or casual Aerosmith fans. If you are a new or casual fan of Aerosmith,then get BIG ONES and O! YEAH instead,along with all of their studio albums and their live records,and that should do you just fine. As for me--I already have all of Aerosmith's albums.
1,...Gavin's brilliant, creative, astonishing drumming just couldn't save this album. Ric's vocals made me cringe all throughout the album. It's not just his voice; it's the vocal melodies and harmonies he chooses that do not augment the songs at all, rather, they detract from the song and distract the listener from the inventive music going on beneath - at least they did for this listener. I'm a huge fan of Gavin's drum work, and I actually greatly enjoy Ric's compositions, but I think the duo would be MUCH better off putting out instrumental albums.		I have Circles - this album's predecessor - and the music is great. The vocals on that album are tolerable: nothing more. I knew going into the Man Who Sold Himself that I would have to deal with Ric's vocals, but they're far more annoying, incessantly so, than on Circles, which, as I noted, are tolerable to me. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this album, even to all you Gavin fans out there. If you want to hear a good recent release that Gavin appears on, check out OSI's Fire Make Thunder. It's pretty darn good, although not as good as its predecessor, Blood, on which Gavin also plays.
1,It's interesting how styles change in classical music. Today, everything is played at a fast tempo. The faster the better. In the 1940s and '50s, conductors such as Bruno Walter and Otto Klemperer played everything at a lethargic pace.		I tend to favor the more sedate tempi, but this recording is insane. One awaits the next note to sound with the same dread as when your car has a dying battery. It's no longer music, but it resembles that experiment -- Nine Beet Stretch, by Leif Inge -- where Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is digitally stretched out to 24 hours in duration (with no pitch change). That actually sounds more musical than this mess, because the musicians here don't seem to know how to play the Maestoso tempo at Largissississississimo without inducing many awkward moments.		I'm flabbergasted at the number of positive reviews here. No doubt the fans are all devoted votaries of Gould, and he could've played it backwards, and they'd hail it as a masterpiece.  For me, Bernstein's disclaimer says it all.		Glen Gould is said to have admired the tune&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Downtown/dp/B006J1FDD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Downtown</a>&nbsp;by Petula Clark, too.	What's that? You already have several recordings of it?  Of course you do.
1,I must admit that I don't care for "contemporary" gospel.  It sounds too much like hip/hop to me.  Same beat, same soul-less singing.  I have to also confess that I was brought up with traditional gospel and attended many concerts where the legends of this music "showed up" and "showed out."		I saw one concert that opened with the Kansas City Melodyaires, who almost closed the show! They were followed by Detroit's Meditation Singers (the screamingest women in gospel), the Mighty Clouds of Joy and then the sterling Staple Singers (with Mavis Staples having to sing among the "ruins" left by a most explosive performance by Willie Joe Ligon).  She literally had to step over bodies lying in the aisles. The Apollo Theatre looked like it had been hit by a bomb.		Today, with Kelly Price (singing what she sang on THIS album) and other "contemporary" singers...they couldn't compete with the legends like The Caravans, Dorothy Love Coates and the Gospel Harmonettes, James Cleveland, Alex Bradford, or even New York's Clara Walker and the Gospel Redeamers.		Why have we allowed the SOUL to be taken out of SOUL MUSIC?  The mediocrity of the hip/hop age has all but murdered what the pioneers worked so hard to achieve: THE BLUES, GOSPEL, R & B, SOUL MUSIC.  Hopefully, young artist like Jennifer Hudson, Fantasia Barrino and a few others will not be talked into participating in this "mediocrity" and sing in a style that will carry on the great tradition that was created by the MASTER SINGERS like Aretha Franklin, David Ruffin, Bettye LaVette, etc. in SOUL; Dorothy Love Coates, James Cleveland, Shirley Caesar, Albertina Walker, Alex Bradford, etc. in GOSPEL; Bobby "Blue" Bland, Dinah Washington, Etta James in BLUES, etc.  Great black music MUST be respected and kept alive.
1,"Lady Marmalade: The Best of Patti and Labelle" is a 1995 chronological collection of 16 Epic recordings, 8 by Labelle (tracks 1-8, 1974-1976) and 8 from Patti LaBelle's early solo career (tracks 9-16, 1977-1980).		The songs included here are good, but the legacy of the group Labelle deserves better. For a real collection of Labelle hits, see "Something Silver" a collection of songs taken from their first three albums, released 1971-1973 on Warner Bros. and RCA.		Labelle is Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash.
1,It's Tommy so you know there's gonna be killer acoustic athletics. Most of the time I hear only one guitar.  The bass lines at times are overbearing and annoying.  I really get sick of Tommy's grunts and giggles.  'Happy Hour''s my limit there. I always thought he really sucked at skatting and here it quickly becomes extremely distracting.  After several listenings, I can't believe I actually own  a Tommy Emmanuel album I can't stand.
1,this sucks more than the 2 of them together they should make girls gone wild along with pisstina aguilera, pink, and every other lame azz pop icon.
1,When this release first became available, I fell for the hype. After purchasing it, and a huge disappointment listening..., I know why the only part of it that was previously included was the intro/tune that wound up on the Forgotten Trail release (with "George, the backbone of the group").  The sound quality is horribly lacking, and the performance does not mirror the DeLIVEr'in  album - which changed my life!!!  I had never heard pedal steel played "quite like that" before..., and have since bought the entire Poco catalog - relishing every moment!  The pedal on this Columbia Studios release is only "so-so"..., nothing like any of the other recordings of this material.  After all this time (and hype) - I'm left running for the true Poco stuff!  The liner notes of DeLIVEr'in album ringing in my head....
1,I have to say I am disappointed.  As a long time fan of Rihanna, it seems that she rushed to put a new album out in the height of her career instead of taking time to put forth a solid piece of work like its predessor.
1,Remember when Meat Beat Manifesto used to write actual songs?  You know, with structure, a sense of progression from beginning to end, occasionally with lyrics, choruses, and the like.  It seems as if that approach has gone out the window in recent years, with releases like RUOK, In Dub, At the Centre, and now Autoimmune largely ignoring any kind of focused songwriting.  Instead these albums are collections of repetitive, monotonous drum and bass loops overlaid with a lot of unpleasant squelchy sounds, chunky arrhythmic percussion, and predictable samples from international radio stations.		I think Autoimmune represents a low point in MBM's sound.  It embodies all the weakest elements of his recent releases and takes the songcraft to new levels of laziness.  These tracks simply don't go anywhere; they are defined by their utter lack of direction or energy, making this the first truly boring MBM album.  Even the CD cover lacks originality, as the grid concept echoes the cover of RUOK.		To be fair, it does have a couple bright moments.  "I Hold the Mic!" is a truly excellent Meat Beat track that shows he can still pull off a tight, trippy and well-mixed song with a devastating bassline if he puts his mind to it.  And "Return to Bass" is held together by a fun vocal sample and isn't as meandering as the rest of the album (although it would've benefitted from a more propulsive beat IMHO).  The rest is pretty forgettable when compared to such classics as "It's the Music," or anything off "Actual Sounds & Voices."		I don't want to be too negative as MBM has produced more than its fair share of great electronic music over the years.  This disc, however, is not the best example of their sound.
1,I remember when I first got his album (cd), I put it on and cranked it up.  I was totaly blown away by the opening track, Witch Wolf, JY had created an awesome rocker.  But things didn't stay that way for long.	  The Grove of Eglantine, by Dennis falls flat.  But JY, again saves the cd with the third track, Young Man.  This track has a meaning behind it and kicks butt.	  JC, enters the game with a good As Bad As This, but by the time the track is over, a non listed song pops up, Plexiglass Toliet.  This has to be the worst Styx song in history.  Its a embarresment to listen to, when I play the cd now, I have to turn it off at this point. It's hard to keep listening to the cd after hearing this song, most of the time, I'm able to hit skip, to move on to the next song.  But since its a "hidden" song its tacked onto the end of As Bad As This, and you can't program your player to skip without skipping the first.	  The next song is Winner Takes All, a good message, but Jy voice is whiny, and the cd never really recovers with the following tracks.	  The cd really tries to rock, and at points it really does.  Witch Wolf, and Young Man are two of JY's finest.  Dennis writes three songs and sings vocals on two, one of witch is a duet with JC.  As a concept cd, which it tries to be, it comes up short with its dark message.
1,Ruben says it all in track #1. SORRY. Yes I am sorry he made fans wait so long for his CD. SOrry that only 5 of the songs are worth listening to. Sorry that stores do not take back CDS that have been opened. Sorry that I did not take the hint from Amazon.com, . Ruben SHOULD be sorry, because he has lost a dedicated fan. Also I will watch the next American Idol- though it is doubtful that I will take the time to rush out to the stores, and stand in line, and pay TOP DOLLAR to buy the next winner's CD.  SORRY
1,It insults me that a manufactured boy band can top the charts, when the good music modestly takes the heatseekers positions. I can't respect a band when the majority of the songs have been written by somebody other than the band. Therefore, they cannot sing the songs with real emotions. What Makes You Beautiful is honestly a terrible song, and like another reviewer, their careers are not based upon their musical abilities, but, rather, their looks. And seriously, they don't even look that amazing...	But, in conclusion, if this is what today's world thinks of music, so be it, because in five years, nobody will remember their names.	You're better off spending your money on a good Regina Spektor, Fiona Apple, or maybe Eva Cassidy CD. THEY can SING. And if you're really feeling daring, then go out on a limb and go for stuff nobody's ever heard of before: Gregory and the Hawk or maybe Sharon Van Etten! Perhaps listing my own musical tastes (which are far better than yours if you plan on giving this CD 5 stars -_-) is s little self-absorbed, but children, you need yourself some real music!
1,I'll make it clear right now that these guys are good singers.  However, it takes a little more than good singing and good looks to make a great album.  The songs are overplayed, and probably will not stand the test of  time.  People do not like The Backstreet Boys for their music, but rather  their appearance.  Who knows, maybe one day these guys will surprise us all  with a masterpeice.  However, this album shows they are still first and  foremost, bubblegum teenyboppers.
1,I really agree with the previous reviewer.  No Oli.  No Liliana Chachian.  And very little Nina Miranda.  What do you get?  Braziliance running out the door faster than Ronaldo chasing a loose ball.  This is the outfits 3rd release, second full if you discount their remix project, and boy did they go in another direction.  Sometimes I really hate it when that happens.  I mean, I can't say it enough - what happened?  Why?  Songs From the Tin was a terrific cd.  Liliana's voice was very rich and spirited, Patrick Forge's mixing was on point and getting stronger and Christian Franck - what can I say?  He's a terrific musician and guitarist.	But here they seemed to have dropped the whole Brazilian vibe and have gone in a more African sounding direction.  Then they go towards a more electronic sound instead of having live musicians.  The sound seems forced and this just isn't as original.  Which is okay if you're into that sort of sound.  But it's a bit of a disappointment if you're a fan of the Smoke City and old Da Lata tracks... expecting to hear Franck on the guitar, pinpoint mixing and breathtaking vocals.  I honestly picked this up the day it came out, pumped that it was coming out however couldn't review it - I too listened to it a few times trying to find something fantastic about it but... it's just not there.  The song I enjoyed was "If U Don't Know", but that was the second shortest.  I only hope they take a step back and return to their other sound.	I'd have to recommend against this if you're a "Songs From the Tin" fan or into Smoke City's "Flying Away".  Da Lata does have a remix project but even there be warned, the sound is a bit different from Songs From the Tin (but still much much better than this).  It features some pretty sweet cuts and original Da Lata remakes and takes like Ponteio, Golden and a remix to KV:5's (Marc Brown of Smoke City's other project) Lies & Untruths.  On the flip side if you do enjoy this, you'd probably also enjoy the newest from Mo Horizons (think Foto Viva) cd titled "Mo' Horizons and the New Bohemiam Freedom".
1,When I see albums like this I am led to believe that the only motive for releasing them is GREED! Sorry Alan, I know you're a great country talent, but after numerous collection of mainly the same songs, what else is one to think, especially since this has come out so soon after your Number 1's release not so long ago. With albums like this, the artists & their recording companies are laughing all the way to the bank, & will continue to do so, as long as gullible fans lay down good money for albums like this. How awesome it would be for an artist with integrity, to come along & tell these money-grabbing executives, that their contract should include just one greatest hits edition - or for an artist with as many hits as Jackson, for each of those hits to appear only once on a greatest hits album. That would do away with the "Best of ....", "The Very Best of....", "The Greatest Hits of ....", "The Golden Hits of ....", "The number 1's", "The Ultimate.... Collection", & of course, let's not forget "The Anthology" releases, all of which basically contain the same songs. These releases have no additional artistic merit whatsoever, they are there only to screw the fans out of more money, and make the artists and record companies richer! Having said that let me add that I have absolutely no objection to compilations of hits by artists (e.g., Greatest Hits Volume 1,2,3, etc.,), providing they don't duplicate the same songs on them, & they don't re-release them later on, under a different title. C'mon fans & buyers alike, make a stand against this kind of profiteering. If you already have a greatest hits album, you don't need to buy another with the same tracks on it. Have a look around & see what else is on offer. You will be surprised to see how many new artists are out there, & they need your support for a chance at the big time. And maybe, just maybe, especially if sales in rip-offs like this fall, the message just might get through to artists & recording companies alike, that we're not as gullible as they think we are. Sadly, in order to write my revue, I had to give this album one star, which I believe is one star too many.
1,Just  started it.
1,Another offering from those kidz that seem to annoy us mature folks.  Another album parents should give to the mail man to send overseas after the children grow into mature music.  Once again the songa and audio quality are sung way better by origional artists.  You can probably find a real oldies compilation with thes songs on it at an even better price than this tarnished gold garbage.
1,When the folks at EMI reissued Pink Floyd's Relics on CD they missed a great opportunity to make the definitive Pink Floyd obscurities release. Had they included such gems as Point Me At The Sky, It Would Be So Nice, Apples & Oranges, Nick's Boogie, and Candy And A Currant Bun, this collection would have been as essential as Dark Side or The Wall. This CD is another example of record companies trying to milk as much money out of fans as possible by releasing a few rare songs alongside album tracks.		[DW]
1,Its a hilarious album by one of the worst rappers(next to Vanilla Ice) at that time. After being bashed by a lot of big names in hip hop, Mc Hammer strikes back with some of the lamest diss records you'll ever hear. I find it amusing that Hammer resorted to dissing rappers that were more superior to him with the exception of Mc Lurch of Turd Bass(how is the worst wegro rap group since Young Black Teenagers talking s***? These audacious wannabedowners are something else!). Even though I understood him responding back to them calling him a sellout(which he is), he should have just continued doing being a sellout instead of trying to be G. The only two decent tracks were Dont Stop and the reprise version of Pumps And A Bump(I love that sample of George Clinton's Atomic Dog). Weak diss records like Break Em Off Somethin Proper, Its All Good and The Funky Headhunter are comical at best. Sleepin On A Master Plan(feat the Dogg Pound) is the worst song on here. Next in line would be Dont Fight the Feelin(worst chick record ever), Clap Yo Hands(CORNY!), One Mo Time(more cornier than Clap Yo Hands), Somethin Bout The Goldie In Me(something bout the cheesy in him) etc. Hip Hop Laughables from Hammer: /You talkin that mess on your records/ but face to face your just a punk/ when I see you / Kriss Kross couldn't make you jump/ naw they don't want funk/(LOL!)		/Black Sheep you're weak, your meek/ you're trying to go street/Dres I'll make him lick heads/ but first Im a hit your teeth/(OUCH! SIKE! LOL!)		/See I understand, you're bout as manly as Rupaul/ I'll step on your block and move you out like a U-haul/ so step right up and be the next contestant/ A Tribe Called Quest is a bad investment/(LOL!)		/Smash it trash it/ Serch couldn't pass it/ the trick's last album didn't even go plastic/(I'll admit that one was kind of funny LOL!)		/Im a high school bank boy, nuff said/ the funky headhunter/ so I cant get enough head/(LOL!)		Bottom Line: This Mc Hammer's worst album but its the best comedy album of the year. Hammer wastes too much time dissing rappers who weren't even worth his time. Im glad he went christian and never came back. I don't think the world can take anymore corniness from him.
1,My interest in Beethoven waxes and wanes but theres one composition that never fails to astound me: the Waldstein Sonata and in particular, the messianic moment that occurs some two thirds of the way into the finale (Gilels 1972 at 624 and Backhaus 1969 at 620). Above all, one needs to gazette expectancy.		Of late, as budgets shrink, new up-and-coming artists must be photogenic in order to secure a contract. I cannot recall the last fugginator to be heralded by a major label. This is bad news for those aspirants within the Australian Knappertsbusch Association, all of whom would scare the devil on a stormy night. No company better exemplifies this trend than Deutsche Grammophon  and exhibit one is Alica Sara Ott.		What is her metier? Does anyone know?		With Ingrid Haebler on the phone  shes refusing to surrender her tiara - this is the most lady-like Waldstein on the market. I urge you to read SFLs take on this disc: in cricketing terms, thats a six. Its lack of heroism is so acute as to be memorable. Come the Great Moment above, Pollyanna as Pantocrator makes an appearance. This is a Beethoven who drives around in a carbon-neutral hybrid, who never parks in a disabled spot and whose bathroom features the cleanest of bidets.		Of late, DG has entrusted a recital of Grieg to Ms Alice. Thats the equivalent of being sent to Coventry on a one way ticket  where Aunty Ingrid the Ripper awaits with a vengeance.
1,starts out like Nickelback, ends wheezing.	not sure what these guys were thinking and i'm willing to bet they don't know either.	3 great records in a row before the sonically generic Handwritten and i was really hoping they would bounce back.	didn't happen.	record should be called Get Worse.	the nu-metal heard on this record expired 10 years ago and it didn't taste good then.	i don't begrudge bands that evolve, i really don't, but that's not what we have here.	we've got a band that's looking backwards towards other band's sounds and it's an absolute mess.	i honestly feel, this band is too good to stay in this rut, and look forward to the next record after they realize this turkey just doesn't fly.	kills me to give this band a bad review, but i certainly don't want to enable 'em either.	c'mon Fallon. you're better than Kroeger. why sink to his level?
1,Hardly even sounds like Tammy Wynette.  Pretty squeekie sounding.
1,THE LONDON SYNPHONY PLAY WELL,BUT DORATI IS TO COLD AND MECHANICAL.WHY SO MANY MUSIC CRITICS AND CLASSICAL MUSIC PEOPLE LIKE DORATI WITH TCHAIKOVSKYS MUSIC I CAN NOT FIGURE OUT.
1,Only 1 good song on this cd that I like. The next perso may like the entire cd but for me its a...mehhhhh.
1,I listened to the new album a few times on my computer and than once in my car.  I don't know what it is, but this is the most monotonous album U2 has ever released.  It's predictable, boring, has that sameness running through it, bland, and lacking any originality whatsoever. These guys need to forget EVERYTHING they have done in the past and make a fresh sounding album. Some of the songs sound like they were taken from older songs and sound EXACTLY the same in certain parts. I could swear for a few seconds I was hearing an old U2 song. They clearly are trying to draw upon old musical experiences and albums they made in the past. The great thing about Achtung Baby for example is how fresh and different it was. What a marvelous progression. Than later when they seemed to be losing some originality they stripped it all down and came out with the simple yet pure sounding lovely album All That You Can't Leave Behind. Of course I also loved Joshua Tree and even Rattle and Hum a very different kind of live album. U2 has had it's high points. But I don't see this album as much of an improvement over No Line On The Horizon, just bad for different reasons. One thing I have to admit I do like though is the take on all the songs on the Deluxe Edition during "The Acoustic Sessions".  But even still, the familiar hooks, melodies, harmonies, it's just too much of the same.  However, had the album been made this way in the first place, I would increase my rating to 3 stars. I like this style of music making compared to the full production on these boring songs. Next time I hope they dare to do something different, sound different, just make a new album and explore some unpredictable territory.  They certainly proved in the past they could sound different and explore new terrains, it's that time again. Look how bold and daring Pop was, love it or hate it? But at least they had the balls to make it. This latest album they had no intention of being daring in any way, shape, or form. And that's why I don't like it!
1,Garbage do not waiste your money starts off with a guitar then turns into opera
1,A.C. is George Alan Rekers favorite band, because so many of their ideas are shared concerning you-know-who.	But "Picnic of Love" is his absolute *favorite*  '  '	This album is a departure from most of A.C's output. Gone are the melodic elements, the superb engineering ("look out Steely Dan"), for this is their "unplugged" version.	Lovely acoustic guitar accompanies deeply felt lyrics that inspire warm hugs all around. The vocals remind one of a mixture of Jonathan Richman and Karen Carpenter!	My biggest disappointment was that Bostonian Seth Putnam chose to make fun of himself with this release. Shame on you Seth Putnam! You are so naughty!	Can't wait for the MUSAK release of these classics for my elevator.
1,This disappointing CD has very few of Dottie's greatest hits, and a lot of her doing covers of hit songs from other artists in overproduced versions that are not as good as the originals.  If you want a better collection, I recommend "The Essential Dottie West."  At this writing, it's out of print, so get a used copy.
1,What can I say that hasn't been said already... Poor sound quality, noisy pressings, distortion... etc.. The music is fantastic, The remasters themselves are top notch, but the vinyl quality is another story. Who did Capitol think they were selling to? People who buy vinyl LISTEN TO IT! We are not collectors, we are AUDIOPHILES and want the music to sound the best it can. If you cut corners, we will HEAR IT! I can't help but feel this is a big F. U. from capitol. Now I am back to buying the OLDER pressings that SOUND BETTER! Avoid this set...
1,I bought this CD on the recommendation of my good friend and fellow longtime music-lover John Austin (see his review below), and after listening to it carefully twice, I'm left scratching my head wondering what he found to like about it.  In fact, his assessment of this CD and mine are about as far apart as those of two listeners could be (if you read both of our reviews, you will wonder if we were both listening to the same recording).  I love the baroque and have a healthy appetite for good baroque instrumental music, but to my ears the music here is second-rate:  unimaginative, predictable, and repetitious (I don't think you will mistake it for Handel or Bach).  Based on what we hear here, I would speculate that Veracini, a famous virtuoso violinist, had a limited ability to create interesting musical ideas, and an even more limited capacity for developing them.  Furthermore, the performances don't rise above the level of well-drilled routine competence.  This is music, and these are performances, that don't get off the ground.	Similarly undistinguished is the quality of the engineering.  Many Naxos releases have excellent sound; this is not one of them.  You will want to turn down the volume, because the sound is glassy and hard; if you turn it up, the violin tone is revealed as unpleasantly edgy and steely.  Moreover, the sound is congested, with poor resolution of detail and of the differentiation of the instruments in the ensemble, which seem clotted together into one homogenized, centralized mass; there is a closed-in, boxy, "canned" quality, with no sense of ambience, of openness, of separation, of the players spread out on a left-to-right soundstage.  Instead this 1995 CD resembles a dated monaural recording.  (And let me add that I am listening on a first-class, highly revealing system on which well-engineered recordings sound wonderful.)  Naxos wisely changed the engineer for volume two (1998) in this series, which although recorded in the same hall in Verona sounds much better.  In fact, volume two is preferable on all counts except length:  the music is more interesting and varied, the performances more lively.	To sum up, then, apart from uninspired, monotonous music, routine performances, and mediocre sound, this is a terrific recording.  Seriously, I wanted to like this CD, but I'm sorry to report that I can't find anything to recommend here; in this recording one's fears of a "budget-priced" CD are realized, for everything is on the bargain-basement level.  For me this is one of the disappointments of the bountiful, inviting, and often very rewarding Naxos catalog.  Caveat emptor.  If you want to sample Veracini on Naxos, I suggest you skip this lackluster entry and move on to volume two.
1,After reading reviews I was weary of buying CD.  NOW! you have listed samples to listen to in advance.  I formed my opinion from sample list.  I WILL NOT BUY CD!  Did not like any of the songs.  Love Ruben on AI2.... but, this is not the Ruben I remember.  The voice that sounded like Luther is what sold america on Ruben...........What happened to that voice?  Maybe next time.
1,Aimless.  Synthetic.  All the tracks sound pretty much alike.		Sounds like a pseudo-world-music IMAX soundtrack.  Come back, U2!  What happened after _Achtung Baby_??
1,The fact that there are already 71 used CDs available for sale on Amazon--fairly soon after its release--should be a pretty good indication of the quality of this CD.  I never thought Fantasia could sing well.  Yes, she CAN carry a tune.  The problem is, she sounds like she is singing through her nose.  Every time I hear a song by her, I feel like sending her some Kleenex to clear out those nasal passages.  I could not imagine listening to an entire CD of that voice.		The fact that I have not heard ANYTHING on the radio by Fantasia (thank God)--yet Kelly Clarkson is ALL OVER the radio, is another indication of who has truly earned the title of American Idol.  When Fantasia won--as with Ruben--I predicted that they would have (maybe) one hit and then fade to black.  Thus far, the post-Kelly AI winners have done just that.
1,One time a decent talent but now he shames his heritage. Too many pills, too much booze and a life of living on his name. Since his music is nonsense he presumes to feed his habits by feeding of other peoples prejudices.
1,I liked Bo, Carrie, and Lindsey Cardinelli as favorites. Great song choice of Bo's - "I Don't Wanna Be" to do and put on this album. Everything else is deeply un-CD worthy. Well, no matter what Carrie sings it's amazing, but I didn't like any of her song choices (she should have went with a Leann Rimes song!) so I'm biased there. Congrats to her on winning though and hope for a crossover album so she doesn't just disappear. Every other song on here is old and terrible. Singers take old songs and make great covers all the time, but there was none of that here. I would have picked a different Vonzell song, and Lindsey Cardinelli did an AMAZING job with the Aerosmith song. Who picked these selections?? Don't buy this unless you didn't record Bo's song this season. Better than Gavin Degraw 200%!
1,Please NOTE The Following:	1. They have gone into secular country type of music.	2. They do not hold the line on modesty anymore	3. there are no solid Gospel lyrics in their songs either!		This CD will be a downer for any POG fans that loved the original Quartet group ( Denise, Heather, Shelly and Terry ).		From the moment that Heather Payne left the group, it has NOT been the same. The group has gone down hill and anymore, they don't hold the line when it comes to modesty. I've seen some shocking *Official POG photos* of Denise Jones in a Skimpy dress! I am No Longer A fan of this group... whatever they had has been lost.
1,OK, having been a fan of Doug Pinnick (as a member of King's X) for 12 years I was looking forward to this. But I like only a handful of songs here. The bass is great, but do you really want to listen to Doug's moaning about life? Pass.
1,2 1/2		I suppose LF is as an agreeable entry into the group's distinctive brand of tortured indie-pop as any, though what little gripping power the music once had from under-produced proddings and whispered eccentricities have all but faded over time for me.
1,I know I am calling der Zorn Gottes down upon me, but this is not the greatest performance ever. The tempi are very idiosyncratic and overblown; I imagine a highly emotive teenager might pick these extremes to conduct. In the deathly Adagio, rubato becomes rubatosis.		On the plus side, the BPO is less than perfect, which I find endearing compared to the sometimes sterile and antiseptic levels it reached under Karajan in the 70s and 80s.  The choral work and solo singing are quite good; these save this extreme interpretation from wallowing in complete eccentricity.		Too much is made of the historical context of this performance. A lot of folks pretend to know what Furtwaengler was thinking that made him conduct this way. For all I know, he slowed the Adagio movement to a 20-minute dirge because of the death of Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, the 20th President of Argentina, the day of the performance.  Perhaps he was dreaming about seeing Maureen O'Hara at the opening of  "The Shores of Tripoli." It's all irrelevant twaddle. Most likely of all, Furtwaengler forgot he was conducting Beethoven's 9th and thought it was Bruckner's last symphony.		I don't care why the performance is so melodramatic, slow, and overly Romantic. It just is. This isn't "a laser beam down a dark mineshaft"  (what the heck is that supposed to mean, anyway?).  It's very slow Death By Chocolate, that is, not something your doctor would recommend you indulge in more than once a year. If you like your Beethoven too slow, go for Klemperer and the Philharmonia (although the soloists are more enjoyable in Furtwaengler). Klemperer's  "Molto Vivace" is four minutes longer than Furtwaengler's!  There are times when you have to appreciate Toscanini's approach:  speed it all up to fit in a 60-minute live broadcast, as in 1939.  Seventy-four minutes is too long.		To be fair, there are lots of ways to interpret this work.  The buyer should be aware that Furtwaengler 1942 is at one, far extreme.  If you like the Daily Stormer or Breitbart, you might enjoy Furtwaengler. If you prefer Mother Jones or the Weekly Worker, Toscanini might be more your taste.  But most of us are somewhere in between.  For (either) Times or WaPo readers, I suggest Tennstedt and the LPO at a reasonable 68 minutes.  It is a less histrionic--and therefore more seriously stirring--reading.  Tennstedt's recording stands firmly at the gateway between Classical and Romantic--no dark mine shafts or laser beams there.
1,As much as I'd love to give this EP a 5 star review, I can't. Jurassic 5 is an extremely talented group of emcee's, but I can't help but feel cheated by this EP. Out of the 8 tracks, only 4 are actually real songs.  The other four tracks are brief, rather pointless interludes. When I paid  $10 for an EP, I expect to get 8 actual songs, which is standard EP length.  It's bad enough when an album is full of interludes, but it's ludicrious to  put them on an EP. Still, I'll be looking forward to Jurassic 5's new, full  length release this fall, which will hopefully contain more actual music  from these entertaining emcees. NOTE: (I noticed that the amazon.com's  track listing said that there was a 9th track called Blacktop Beat, however  my CD doesn't contain that track).
1,I don't know quite what to make of this album, or how to determine what part of it is her, what part is people she has known, and what part is people she has seen at a distance. But one thing is certain, it is all filtered through a suppressed anger which transforms the stories in these songs into dirges with very little color or light.		Her vocal method of delivery here is a closed-throat, closed-mouth drone that is unnecessary. She has a good voice but won't let it shine because she doesn't trust her lyrics alone to reach the listener and leave their mark. She is the real loser in Bittertown because she hasn't accepted and moved on.
1,Even without Peter Gabriel, Trick of the Tail and Wind and Wuthering were rock solid. Even without Gabriel and Steve Hackett, And Then There Were Three and Duke had more than their share of redeeming moments. But with Abacab, the band finally hit bottom, although later albums would show the bottom was further still.		Most of the songs here would have fit in on a Phil Collins solo album ("No Reply At All," "Man On The Corner.") Only the title song and "Dodo" show any real contribution from the entire band. After the success of Collins' Face Value, it was inevitable that Banks and Rutherford would take a back seat to Collins, and that remained the case until Collins departure from the band.
1,This is so bad-taste, I can't understand why some people like a band like that, with no good songs at all. Even in death metal genre, there are hundreds of better bands.
1,before you buy this poor cd you have to buy cathedral-"forest of equilibrium" and winter -"into darkness" which are what this band is trying to be .be wise .smoke a lot.know what good music is.
1,There are some great tracks on this disc including "Please", "Last Night On Earth". Overall though there are more than a few forgetable moments that make this one of the band's most uneven recordings.	Another in the line of 90's studio wizardry experiments which included "Zooropa", this collection disappointed more than a few fans at its release. The problem is it sounds like U2 is trying so hard to cut tracks in the vein of the master craftsmen of electronica. You can't blame them for trying, it's important for any band to branch out and expore their art.	Yet U2 is a rock band, one of the greatest ever. Their most satisfying collections yield powerful recordings when they get back to basics and do what they do best. As the slower and more serious songs that comprise most of the CD are the stand outs here, the CD moves slowly and is difficult to listen to all the way through. A shame as the last three songs are all very good. Some of the more notable recordings here might prove better eventually on a compilation disc mixed in with more upbeat material.
1,It is a load of weak beats, naive lyrics and cannot hold up. The farther in you go, the weaker this gets. I threw away 18 gazeto's on this album, expecting hot tracks. Aight, thre were some hot tracks, but also some serious bull.
1,This may have been well recieved and critically acclaimed, but it just hasn't reached out and grabbed me. The remaster is great, terrific sound quality, but the music itself just wasn't for me.
1,The first Glass Hammer CD I got was On to Evermore, which is pretty good.  Then I got Perelandra.  The keyboards are very good and so are a few of the tunes.  But the vocals are a bit weak in places, and whoever or whatever is doing the drumming needs big-time improvement. Also, the tunes are not strong across the whole album. This album lacks fire/pizzazz/excitement, unless you are excited solely by fast keyboard runs.
1,If you don't have a good original, eh...., then get it, I guess. But practically any CD or even MP3 will sound just as good or better. This vinyl version sounds dead, dry, worse than any vinyl that I have, and, being a crazy collector, I have probably 6 or 7.
1,It's never easy being the President of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association. There's an AKA Chapter in Helsinki. It went "offline" for a year or so. There were reports of riotous behaviour, if not an outright bacchanalia. As per the Constitution of the AKA, if there's any boozing or shagging going on, I wanna know about it! Accompanied by JK (the Chief Procurement Officer of the AKA), I flew in my private jet to Finland. Flight attendants from Cathay Pacific - broadminded and affable to the last - made our flight a pleasant one. Shortly after landing in Helsinki, we attended an "all gods are dead" party and squared things up with the local AKA Chief - Malverns. Knackered and somewhat zinc-depleted, we spent a few days in the Finnish capital before departing. We ran into bad weather. Against my better judgement, we made an emergency landing at Vozrozhdeniya Island in what's left of the Aral Sea. It's the former bioweapons facility of the Soviet Union. As we alighted at the aerodrome, we were greeted by Corporal Oblomov - the only guy left on the island. He was shabbily dressed and drunk as a skunk. Stupidly, I asked after his welfare. He replied		"When you don't know what you're living for, you don't care how you live from one day to the next. You're happy the day has passed and the night has come, and in your sleep you bury the tedious question of what you lived for that day and what you're going to live for tomorrow."		I was about to respond back in kind when I noticed a stench in the air. What could it be? There were two heaps nearby. They were mountainous and clearly toxic. The first consisted of copies, new and used, of Harnoncourt's first recording of Figaro from the mid-Nineties with the Concertgebouw whereas the second featured his later recording of the same opera with the Vienna Philharmonic on DG. Nausea overcame me.		"That's all well and good," I replied irately at Oblomov, "but why have you left these around in the open air! Don't you have a wider responsibility to mankind? Why didn't you bury them with the anthrax?"		The vodka in him replied back in gibberish. JL was disgusted as I was. Oblomov hobbled away. As much as we dared, we wandered over to scrutinise the two near-pyramids.		"Good lord!" JL exclaimed! "Everything has to land somewhere in the world - and look where these nasties have ended up!"		"I've often wondered about their fate," I muttered. "Harnoncourt has plenty of hits and misses to his name, the latter usually occurring when he channels the Wild-Man-of-Borneo-within. But in both instances of K 492, it's a misfire. He does not have it in him! He's congenitally unable to conduct Figaro!"		I was asked to explain myself.		"First, listen to the Overture in both recordings. It should be fool-proof. Against all odds, he stuffs it up with a `Dawn of the Dead' approach. Mark my words: when Maximianno Cobra takes up the challenge of Figaro and makes it into an all-day job, blame Harnoncourt! Sure, there are good singers in both casts but it doesn't matter in the least - not at all! Harnoncourt never settles into a rhythm. There's no inevitability to the flow of the music. One can never predict his tempos. Goaded by the Devil, no less, Harnoncourt is slow when he needs to be fast; he's fast when he needs to breathe; he's jumpy, aggressive and direct, particularly in the earlier recording, when grace is required; he's lethargic when evanescence is demanded. And there is something particularly dead - or more dead, as I should say, to the DG performance! It's Figaro as Bluebeard's Castle! No matter! Mention must also be made of Anna Netrebko's Susannah-as-Marcellina and Bo Skovhus-as-Theo-Adam (circa 1980) in the DG recording and Anton Sharinger's asthmatic-like Figaro on Teldec." I gritted my teeth. "You get my drift. Why elaborate any further? There's nothing else to be said!"		We left it at that. Melbourne awaited us. If you come across a copy of either performance in the biosphere, do the world a favour! Send it to Vozrozhdeniya Island and count yourself blessed!
1,Im sorry if this pisses off rabid KsE fans but these guys just lost it after they lost Jesse Leach. In many ways this sounds exactly the same as the previous disc. I think they reached a pinnacle with Alive or Just Breathing and have not surpassed it since. Although there are some hints of progression and maturity I must say overall the disc fails to hold my interest,probably because in spite of itself the "metalcore" scene finds itself oversaturated with bands that all sound the same. Ive seen some defenite and dramatic changes with certain bands as they released newer material,Dry Kill Logic and Chimaera immediately come to mind. But unfortunately,this one just doesnt do it for me. Dont get me wrong,it doesnt suck,but Ive been a metalhead now since the 80's and its going to take a bit more than a few subtle time changes and some more mature chord progressions to impress me. Check out the new In Flames,The Haunted,Children of Bodom.
1,After hearing Follow the Leader and comparing it to the first two, I really can't appreciate it and it kind of told me where this band was going. Another once great band hitting the nu-metal slump. And, obviously I was right because now we have this. On this and FTL, Jon Davis no longer has any substance to his lyrics. He just whines about nothing. This album has at least 4 or 5 stupid one minute fillers as well which get really annoying after awhile. REALLY annoying. The vocals and lyrics are the true reason why this album is so terrible. And the drums as well. I don't know why he went from doing hard, intricate drumbeats with cool fills (first two albums) to doing this easy simple ... (these last two albums). However, there may be hope for KoRn. Everything I've heard from the Untouchables so far, I've liked. It seems they are experimenting with some new sounds and stuff (Thoughtless) and he's actually picking new topics to sing about it seems like. Maybe I'll pick it up despite how much this album ...
1,when you see another Box Set with Elvis your'e thinking you might be getting something new.but this is just another slick attempt at Cashing in on the Elvis Well. Outtakes&things are all Subjective but the Problem here is that aside from the Up to date Sound Quality you are truly not messing anything if you don't get this set.the Live Concert is pretty average at best.in other words save your money there are better Sets of His Stuff around.it has some Moments but it's not worthy of more than a Couple Discs tops&even then you could get even more with just One Disc if you are going this Route with Elvis.
1,disappointed in the cd, thought there were more hits
1,I'll have to second Mr. Harding's comments. There are some good songs on here, but the singing isn't the finest I've ever heard in the gospel realm and the musicianship is competent but not overwhelming. The live recording also tends to make the piano sound distant at times in the mix.		I can only imagine people like this because of the feeling they get from the sheer enthusiasm of those involved. You definitely do pick up on the "Spirit" for lack of a better term when these punchy numbers hit an acappella break and the soloist is testifyin' over the choir's loud clapping.		Note: This release adds three bonus tracks to the original 1960 lineup. "Restore Unto Me (The Joy of Thy Salvation)","The Lord's Prayer" and "The Lord Will Make a Way (Somehow)" are the additional tracks. (I can't say any of them are outstanding, however.)		HIGHLIGHTS:	"Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody" gets over on its spitfire call and response between soloists Calvin White and Margaret Sampson and the choir at large. White shines on "Sweet Jesus", a lovely ballad that goes into near orbit during a sumptuous acappella break.		LOWS:	"He Stays in my Room" is PAINFUL to listen to thanks to a dissonant vocal. Faytha Drayton sounds fairly nasal on her solo in "You Can't me Doubt Him". Bessie Lewis seems to struggle to maintain the key in "He is Such an Understanding God".		BOTTOM LINE:	If you're a gospel devotee, you'll probably like this well enough. If you, like me, listen to Christian music but you're selective about WHO you listen to, you may not find this compelling enough to want a copy for your collection.
1,This album is naff, it's a real stinker from beginning to end. It's self indulgent, pompous and boring. 4 Overlong tracks of symphonic sludge. Gone is Bill Bruford's crisp but enigmatic drum technique. Gone is Chris Squire  crunchy bass riffs. In comes synthesisers galore, temples bells ,  stampeding elephants, you name it everything was thrown on this album. The  album was a huge disappointment as the 3 previous studio recordings had the  best Yes line up.	So why am I commenting on it?.	The album is a bench  mark. It has become a point of reference of where rock music went wrong. It  was a major that ignited the New Wave.	Considering all the rubbish that  is around now, we need something as horrible as this to trigger off  something completely different! .
1,Albums are meant as a total experience. Stefani's album is merely a collection of songs. Not very good songs too, I may add.		My main grouse with this is 'Where's the heart?' The album just doesn't have a soul to it at all, it's just mass produced garbage. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to mainstream music. It's the fact that soulless and pointless works like these hog the limelight away from music that truly touches lives.		Let's see. If you concur with me, click yes. If not, click no.
1,Jackson Browne is a relic of the past. His first few albums are classics while most if his material for the past 10-15 years completely misses the mark. Time to retire from the music biz while you still can Mr Browne and take up painting but please not writing as your socialist point of few fails to impress those who truly love capitalist America.
1,The music is dated and reeks of early 90's.  Linda Perry, an obvious untalented has-been, wrote all the songs in this horrible CD. There is no inspiration, the songs are simply terrible, the drums are boring; Perry is a disaster.  Kelly should have known the songs were garbage, I find it hard to believe anyone would like them.  A couple of high points are that she actually sings pretty well and is aware of her voice limitations. She keeps within her voice range.  The first two songs could have been awesome had the teeny bopper bells been deleted and the overkill flanger effect minimized.  The second song has a 70's disco drumbeat that just doesn't work - it weakened the song.  Song three and four are latrine filler. The rest of the songs are low average.  Ok to buy the CD if you like early 90's music and Kelly's voice.
1,This album sucks!!!  Two maybe three good songs on it!!  Thats B.S.  I guess your just paying for the cool artwork!!!
1,Now, I'm not saying that LL Cool J's eleventh album The DEFinition is bad because L is too old. There are some rappers in their mid `30s that can still bring the heat (Raekwon, Jay-Z, Guru). The problem I have with the album is that its further proof that his glory days are long behind him. In fact, he's been in a downward spiral since Mr. Smith, and after he released 10, which only appealed to the ladies, I wondered if he would be able to resurrect his career.		With this album, the answer is no. Basically, editorial reviewer Dalton Higgins really hit the nail on the head with this one. This is one of those albums where the only good songs are the singles: "Hush" and the essential club-banger, "Headsprung". The latter was produced by Timbaland, and Tim also shows up elsewhere on the album, but sometimes his beats can't even save the songs, like the filler track "Every Sip" and the terrible "Rub My Back". And the beat to "Apple Cobbler" isn't even that great, not to mention that the song makes no kind of sense.		Another filler track is when R. Kelly shows up for "I'm About to Get Her". You can tell Kells produced it because it sounds like the same music he used for Twista's "So Sexy". By the way, that song is where L starts his lyrical faux pas ("that's why I'm still a teen idol like Hanson"). And then it's on to the bizarre "Shake It Baby" (which isn't even what you'd think it would be about). At the end of the third verse he says to a foe: "You burnin' me? Two words: impossible." That's one word, L.		"Feel the Beat" is fine but then it suffers from a chorus that sounds like it came from 1986: "Yes yes y'all/Feel the beat y'all/Break break y'all/You don't stop". You can even tell he's going to say that by listening to the beat. And "Can't Explain It" is the only other song for the ladies that comes close to working, but when you listen to the song you can't help but say, "It's okay, but it's no `Hey Lover.'"		It's not that LL can't rap any more, but the things he's saying on here makes the album, well, embarrassing. In fact, it's so embarrassing that I'd almost rather listen to 14 Shots to the Dome. It's good that he's had a nice, long career, but it'd be better if most of the albums in it were above-average. As you probably suspected by now, The DEFinition is only good for completing your LL Cool J collection.		Anthony Rupert
1,I'm sorry, but that's the only word I can use to describe this stuff. Oh, wait..."mediocre" is another. And, for the reviwer below who put King Crimson in the same paragraph with this band should be ashamed of themselves. I'm headed to the record store now to see if I can get a buck or two by selling it!
1,Since some french dance acts started appearing in the late nineties, a new dance scene began to emmerge as well, mixing disco beats with electronica and generating a retro-futuristic sound. Daft Punk were one of the more challenging and inventive bands, even if their albums are flawed and uneven. Air offered laid-back, dreamy and smooth atmospheres. Cassius, however, failed to engage, as one can prove with "1999".	Yes, this record has a couple of interesting dance songs like "Crazy Legs" or "Interlude", still as a whole it`s a repetitive, uninspired, endless and at parts irritating album. Some of this material is ok for a nightclub, but as a record it doesn't really get off the ground. It brings nothing new, it`s basically a waste of time, and ends up being another flat, monotonous and overrated record.	A collection of fillers.
1,I'm not a big fan of dvd tutorials to begin with but this was like learning math after taking acid.
1,No, not every supergroup fails. Look at Fugazi. And as far as grunge bands go, look at Mad Season, although they were not perfect. Many other bands as well were decent enough. Sometimes making two great sounds can make a bombastic album. However, Audioslave manage to be something that neither Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden ever were: Bland corporate rock. These songs are not all dreadful, but you get the feeling after awhile that all of these songs are too similar and while it's really good the first time, you eventually realize that these songs are all by-the-numbers. The musicianship of each member is just as good as it was before but with Audioslave you get underwhelming results.		Except for the exceptional "Shadow on the Sun", there isn't really anything worthy of note as far as good songs go. Some of those were already singles. I guess I was expecting a lot more from them. In spite of this corporate rock sound I actually do have respect for Audioslave. I just can't get why I can never get into them, as I have honestly tried.		For a better supergroup album, try the one from Velvet Revolver. For albums of the artists, try Soundgarden's 'Badmotorfinger' and 'Superunknown' (then complete from there) and Rage's self-titled and 'Battle of Los Angeles' albums. I honestly haven't heard their new album but I think I'm not shelling any money out on that unless it's used or strongly discounted.
1,As a whole, this album really REALLY sucks, but.  BUT, it just may be worth the buy for some New Jack Enthusiasts.  Three tracks save this album from hitting the trash cans:  "Something in your eyes", "lost in the momment" and "Above the rim."  "Something in your eyes" is perhaps one of the best R&B New Jack swings songs that never was.  It never got the recognition it deserved, but has always stuck with me over the years.  "Above The Rim" actually kinda sucks, but Michael Bivens verse always gets me going and is the only reason I mentioned this song.  The ryhmes he spits are off the hook folks in "Above The Rim."  The song "lost in the momment" is a little too simple for my taste, but it still manages to drift the listener away like any good R&B track from '95 can.  BOTTOM LINE, if you are down with New Jack Swing and mid 90's R&B, this album is a MUST, otherwise, PASS.
1,My opinion is based on seeing ten(10) live performances on the stage of Verdi ' Aida , with the following singers: Caterina Mancini, Zinka Milanov, Birgit Nilsoon, (2) Maria Curtis-Verna(2) Apprile Millo, Leontyne Price (2) and Herva Nelli, and hearing every studio recording starting with	Dusolina Gianini and Aureliano Pertile, La Scala, cond. by Carlo Sabajno , 1928.to the present performance with Antonio Pappano.	This recording is a disaster , with almost every singer being miscast. I don't know who is responsible for this selection of singers? It would be much better if this recording had been canceled! Let's start with the most famous singer , Jonas Kaufmann: he is excellent as Siegmunt in	Wagner's Die Walkurein the recording at the Metropolitan Opera, outstanding as Cavaradosi in Puccini's Tosca, good as Don Jose in Bizet's Carmen but as Radames in Verdi's Aida? He not only doesn't have the right voice, but also his voice is to low for the high tessitura the role requires and he is uncomfortable and should stop singing this role immediately before it will,ruined his voice. Baritone Ludovic Tezier, an	Excellent Marcelo in Puccini's La Boheme is also wrongly castin the role that requires not only power but plenty of suavity . Just listen to the	Recording of Amonasro with Leonard Warren and you will know what I mean!.  Soprano Anja Harteros as Aida : Her singing is a complete disaster. Poor legato , shortage of breath , lack of suavity is terribly manifested throughout the recording . Her voice perhaps good in less demanding roles is poorly equiped for this most difficult roles , which requires perfect legato ,complete control of the high tessitura ,in short thrue	bel- Canto singing. The Russian mezzo- sop. Ekaterina Semenchuk has a good voice and her future sounds good, but she lacks the stage	Experience . Her singing pales when compared with the great Fedora Barbieri. All other supporting singers are acceptable . Good Orchestra	And chorus is conducted by Sir Antonio Pappano and the sound is not always well balanced is excellent. This recording dosen't deserve my recommendation and repeated hearing.
1,I hate to write negative reviewes, but I feel like I must warn art-rock fans of purchasing this "masterpiece". I`ve never heard their other CDs, but this one irritates me with its boredom. Stick with KING  CRIMSON or GENTLE GIANT, they have no matches...
1,Let me say that Ms. Roberts' debut album is one of my favorite CDs of all time and I listen to it over and over. On THAT CD, her voice is very clear and pure and the songs are just great! But when I played THIS CD, it was immediately apparent that her voice has changed drastically. It's somehow deeper and raspy, not nearly as pretty. The worst part, however, was the song selections. These songs just aren't very good, not matter who is singing them. After a few listens, I'm giving the CD away.
1,When you are one of the most loved pop musicians in history and yet your twenty-songs greatest hits album contains quite a lot of filler, something is definitely wrong.		And it's not hard to figure it out. Lennon was a polarizing character, a perennial maker of front page news, and a wannabe revolutionary (to his credit, he had the courage to admit he hadn't change anything) but most of all he was a mediocre musician. He did write some beautiful songs, quite a few forgettable ones, and a whole lot of utter trash. This is accurately reflected in his Greatest Hits. Even some who gave this album rave reviews admit they skipped over some of the songs because they don't remember them -they are fillers in a top hits compilation.		Old coots like me who lived through the Beatles and post Beatles period remember too well that, after 1975's Rock and Roll (just a covers album), he was pretty much forgotten. No records, no tours, nobody wanted to play with him, while the much reviled Sir Paul nailed hit after hit, although the critics labeled him "commercial candy". Many years after, Paul's post Beatles career includes a boatload of amazing songs, and new generations still love them. Now ask any contemporary (or old, for that matter) listener how many Lennon songs he/she knows and loves other than Imagine.
1,Total bootleg. Skips a while bunch on Jessica and dear Sergio. Bough cause it was cheap and a heat ska album. Don't buy if you want a poorly made bootleg.
1,Thanks, Sony, for the rip-off low-quality remaster with "Bonus" tracks. Hellbent for Leather is one of my favorite Priest albums but this remaster sounds just as shallow and tinny as the original release. The bonus track is musically identical to "Rock Hard, Ride Free" except for different lyrics in the chorus. "Riding on the Wind" is fine, I suppose, if you enjoy live recordings.  This is the worst sounding so far of the 8 Priest CD's Sony has remastered.	If you're thinking of buying this particular remaster for richer sound and better bass then skip it. If you're buying it for the bonus tracks then you'll probably be happier putting on the "Defenders" CD.	If you're a hard core fan and just HAVE to have it, prepare for disappointment.  All of the jewel-case spines in your collection will match though...  Oh, except for the first two recordings which are still owned by some nut-job label: be careful not to be fooled into buying the latest re-issues of "Rocka-Rolla", "Sad Wings...," or "Best Of"!!!
1,This CD is profoundly disappointing.  Gone are the wonderful, wacky, chill-out tunes like "Donkeys in Heaven," or that song where the cat meows through it.  Fully half the tracks here sound like Oasis outtakes, with a lead singer who'd be booed off a karaoke stage.  Banal lyrics are repeated over and over again until you run screaming for the "off" button.  Maybe three tracks are reminiscent of the Bent we know and love, but they're not worth wandering through the dross.		I don't know what happened -- if, like with Wham!, the talented part of the group left -- but this is a major disappointment from a wonderful group.
1,2 stars for the 2 half decent songs on this one. I try to be fair in any review I decide to leave, but AFI is plainly washed up. I'm a fan of everything they've done from Black Sails to Decemberunderground. Tried to acquire all the BSides and live covers etc, etc through the years. Everything prior to BSITS and post DU are garbage. They followed DU with Crash Love which almost lost me but I kind of considered that one a 'sophomore jinx' because of the ridiculous commercial success of DU so looked forward as a fan to their next one. We're all allowed our opinions but Davey in particular lost his edge and no screaming on this one? Lost me fellas. It's pretty much Crash Love, part deux.
1,Quite frankly, in my opinion, there is only one good song in		this album, and actually the only song I was interested in to		begin with when I purchased this CD.The song is: "Hush My Baby"		The rest of the CD is boring!
1,Considering it's been three years plus since they released a studio album, you'd think this album would be filled with many good songs. You're lucky if you can find one. With the huge selection of bands out there why would you  blow your money on this one? If this review sounds harsh...well the truth hurts. Don't bother.
1,Considering how much of a perfectionist and realist Michael Mann supposedly is, I was quite surprised in the first 5 minutes of the film when (a) the volume as Numb/Encore immediately hits you doesn't make you jump out of your seat; (b) the DJ in the club does an absolutely awful job of mixing one song to the next (I'm a mobile/party DJ in my spare time).		Now it turns out that the Linkin Park/Jay Z tune, the one ALL OVER the trailers and ads, isn't even ON the soundtrack (of course, those taglines about being afraid of violence and foreboding and badness happening right now didn't make the flick either).		Jan Hammer wasn't asked to provide any music for the movie, but composer Murphy attempts (feebly) to acknowledge the 80's icon's legacy (one piece lifts a couple of chords from "Crockett's Theme").		Mann abandons the success he had in marrying familiar songs to dialog-free vistas in the TV show (and in his movies - remember In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida), instead choosing fairly anonymous/generic (c)rap metal that adds little to the atmosphere of the film.  This is summed up less by the inclusion of a bludgeoned cover of the series' most famous accompaniment ("In The Air Tonight") than by the name of the hack band performing it.  Was there a POINT to the choice of this music?  NON!
1,Their self titled debut is steeped in period arrangements, and doesn't really hit the mark. Reminiscent of Little River Band, album contains too few bright spots and relies mainly on the repetitive beat of disco. This album is for Toto coniseurs only, and is a stepping stone to Hydra, which is by far their most brilliant work.
1,All of these tracks are hopelessly brickwalled.  And it's a pity because some of them sound like they might sound awesome with some headroom.		So all-in-all, it's a wasted effort.		EDIT:  Please go to youtube and type in "loudness wars". There's a 1:52 video that will explain what I mean.
1,this does not have the full and free sound of the bagpipes that we all love. the performers were so intent on impressing that the rich sound of the pipes was left behind.
1,Good.
1,YOU KNOW SOMETIME HIS MUSIC ALL SOUNDS THE SAME .DON'T GET ME WRONG HE IS VERY VERY TALENTED BUT THIS CD JUST REALLY DOES NOTHING 4 ME IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMTHING THAT HE HAS DO BEFORE HE JUST REMASTERD IT .TRY AGAIN KELLY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PULL THE SHEETS OVER MY HEAD WITH THIS ONE.
1,This CD is not up to par with Celtic Thunder.  It is good, but I was expecting more.
1,First of all, let me just say that I love many Casting Crowns songs and I'm not just here to bash all of the hard work they've put into this cd. I count "Who am I", "Voice of truth", "Praise you in this storm", "Stained glass masquerade", "Slow fade", and "East to west" as my some of my favorite songs. But therein lies the main problem I have with Casting Crowns. On each of their cds I've liked no more than 4 songs (their debut) and the rest just aren't up to par for me. They seem like a two song per cd radio hit kind of band. This cd is no exception. I rate "Until the whole world hears" and "If we've ever needed you" both at 4 star songs but the rest of the album is 0 stars. It feels like filler that is blah and forgettable. The band falls into the trap of only concentrating on the lyrics to the detriment of the music. When I look to buy a cd these days it has to first capture my attention with the sound, it needs to be different or done so well that I'm not distracted and can take in the lyrics, "Until the whole world hears" as a cd doesn't do that for me. There were few times when I said, "boy that piano riff sounds like it was ripped from such and such song" and "that guitar part reminds me too much of this song" etc. I'll just say I was hoping for more...
1,There is nothing that stands out on this cd.  The music never varies from the opening refrains, the lyrics are pretty bog standard, the singer's voice is ok, but not strong or powerful enough to carry the tune, and he is rather nasally and flat at times.  The best tracks, "city", "tonight" and "keep"  have potential, but never develop into anything more than passably noticeable.		In one word:  forgettable.
1,This album is considered a minor classic. Can someone explain why?	The riffs are excellent, the drumming intense, the vocals brutal. Problem is, Pantera forgot to write any songs. Most of this album is just a few riffs thrown together at random, the odd sub-Death Metal growl over things, continue for four or five minutes, then do it again. Most of this album is "brutal for brutal's sake", and forget playing music.	Case in point, "Becoming". There is just no flow to the song whatsoever, sounding like someone with Attention Deficit Disorder put it together. Vinnie Paul has the strangest kickdrum sound this side of an old Dismember album. Dimebag's riffs do not run into each other. Phil Anselmo growls monotonously. Rex's bass is there somewhere, and it just gets frustrating, because it should be better.	Dimebag Darrell's guitars are the high point of the album, and also a disappointment. He's a one of a kind player, but seemed intent in showing off. The guitar sound has a killer, crunching tone to it, but almost every song featured a clipped, almost staccato riff in it somewhere.	Phil Anselmo must be one of the worst singers in metal. He has the vocal range of a rutting stag. His vocals are one dimensional, and many of the lyrics incredibly juvenile. `Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills' has to be a contender for one of the worst songs to ever make it to record, so inane are the lyrics.	There are none of the classic headbangers on this album, like "F***ing Hostile" or "Primal Concrete Sledge" or "Domination". `Vulgar Display Of Power' suffered a little of the disjointed song writing too, yet the other albums either side of this pair are excellent.	Pantera seemed to be doing everything they could to distance themselves their early career `Glamtera' days by being as brutal as possible. They were also trying to distance themselves from the days when they were compared to Metallica. So they copied Exhorder's sound instead, note perfect but without the songs to back it up. Exhorder's albums sell second hand for many times the original price. `Far Beyond Driven' turns up in the bargain bin.	This is simply just not good music.
1,listened to it 3 times, and each time i think its boring, and not catchy. I think G N' R and STP are both better bands by themselves
1,As in the title to this review, that says it all.  It is a heavy album, no dispute about that and I know it is death metal, so the vocals are going to be cookie monster like.  But, these vocals by "Lord Worm" are just atrocious. If the vocals were better, I would have liked the album more probably.  I don't see the big deal about this vocalist "Lord Worm."  I prefered Mike Disalvo since he was freakin HEAVY and more understandable.  BUT, I even have a gripe about Disalvo because of the boring factor, nothing about his voice changed at all in Whisper Supremacy, no tempo changes in his voice, nothing.  And the same goes for "Lord Worm" in None So Vile as far as I could hear.  Both Vocalists while heavy just didn't make the albums fun and enjoyable.  And I like heavy metal, just not this heavy metal band.  I hope to like an album they put out in the future, I didn't just hear one song from these guys and dismiss them.  I bought none so vile and whisper supremacy twice. And no matter how much I listened to the albums and tried to get into them, I couldn't.
1,get drunk and laid and stop your completely horrendous whining. and grow some hair before your 50th birthday (itll creep up on ya)
1,I can see why the Lox don't like to talk about this debut. This sounds as if Puffy did the whole album.  Puffy and his Bad Boy production team produced most of the songs and it sounds like complete rejects from his No Way Out album instead of a Jadakiss/Sheek Louch/Styles project.  Money, Power, Respect with DMX and Lil' Kim is the only strong song on the album. And what was the point of having the Mad Rapper on this album? Even the Hitmen's offerings come off as lame.  The Ron Lawrence/Deric Angelettie song come off as lousy.  And the ones from Nashiem Myrick, Stevie J and Carlos Broady come off as mediocre. But the low point is the pop-driven sound of If You Think I'm Jiggy, which Puffy produced and what worked for Mase doesn't work for the Lox. The song blatantly interpolates Rod Stewart's 1978 disco-driven hit Do Ya Think I'm Sexy. It's got a catchy beat a la Puffy, but the song's pretty bad and overly commercial. Out of 40 to 60 songs that Puffy produced in 1997 for artists, that's his worst!  The lyrics on the album come off as materialistic and don't tell me too much about the group's background. Jadakiss had harder-edged rhymes and lyrics on the Lox' 2000 album and his solo stuff, but there's nothing he really offers here. The album's commercial sheen comes off as creatively empty. They should have let Puffy rap on this album instead and called it The Four Beats to Shake to.
1,Pathetic, meaningless songs. I could give  a crayon to 2 year olds and get better lyrics. This is not metal, this is barely rap-core. Void of melody or talent. Stay as far away as possible from this CD. Want quality metal? Try In Flames or Children of BOdom, just stay as far away as possible from this CD.	"Adidas, rapping, angsty lyrics, samples, funky grooves, screaming, ad nauseum. Stand in line, you know the drill. More spokes off the hub that Korn have wrought, and to a lesser extent, the Deftones, whose utter superiority to this cack is so obvious I just have to laugh. And laugh I will. You see, rap music is that airheaded kid that sat at back of your classroom, popular, but vacant, and damn difficult to ignore because he was so obnoxious. Lyrical analysis is futile though, sorta like perusing mattress tags for an iambic sonnet. But don't mind me, 'cause this will sell like justice for the rich. If you like your Korn-metal with an odious rap husk, well, there it is."
1,These songs are re-recorded and are not the ORIGINALS!!!--the original Drifter CD's are everywhere- Clyde, Ben E. King, etc.- The are Excellent Comp's; original LP's; two-fer's, Box Set's-Please seek them out- if you like these-you will be blown away by the real deal
1,Not the same songs like it used to be. There are a bunch of great oldies removed or replaced with other songs that are not all that great. If i knew what it sounds like now I would have no\t spent my moneyplus  on this collection.  Only original thing is the photos on the covers.  EAST SIDE RECORDS  you took a good thing and  and messed it up..  I feel cheated  for buying this collection that is not original like it was at first. I don't like most of the songs on here.  except for a few .  If you want the real east side albums  don't waste yor money  it really is not a good song selection at all but for a few. in my opinion they ruined what used to be  a realy good thing  and calling it original. Im from the old school. Whoever redid this collection is a moron.
1,How could anyone possibly enjoy this?! It's horrible. Don't buy this even if you're Faith Hill's #1 fan. It SUCKS so hard.
1,Someone must not be dealing with a full deck!  Whaddoyamean by "Extended Long Play Club Versions"?  Do you call You Keep Me Hangin' On by Kim Wilde clocking in at 4:12 an "Extended Long Play Club Version"? Let me let you in on a secret: that song in it's "Extended Long Play Club Version" form clocked in at over 9 MINUTES!!!  Ok, now for Lovergirl by Teena Marie coming in at 4:45 Close but no dice! That song clocks in at over 5 minutes.  This is probally the Album version which I liked better but THAT is not the point!  How about You Dropped a Bomb on Me by The Gap Band? While 5:13 may be long this ain't the "Extended Long Play Club Version".  No surree-bob!  "The Extended Long Play Club Version" clocks in at...get this; 13 MINUTES AND 5 SECONDS.  I used to own the 12" record.  Not only that it has sirens, airplanes and machine guns in it.  I called this version The War-Time version while I called the 5 minute album version The Peace-Time version!  Ok now Word Up by Cameo - unfortunately - IS  the 12" version!  I oughtta give this review ONE STAR over that!  Everybody Dance by Tamara and the Scene NEVER had an "Extended Long Play Club Version" this is the LP version!  Ok, I see that In My House by the Mary Jane Girls is the 12" version.  Now as for the Glamorous Life by Shelia E, technically this is not an "Extended Long Play Club Version" but is WAS the 12" version which was a Club-Edit of the album version.  By "Club-Edit" it is meant that this version was edited not so much as for shortening the song but "re-arranging" it's structure to make it more "Club appealing".  So in all truth, this, being the 12" version, appears is it's full lenght!  As for C'mon Get my Love by Cathy Dennis with DMob, this is NOT the full version which clocks in over 7 minutes!  The David Morales mix would have been great to have on here...I'm dreamin'!		Oh, and as for Grace Jones' Pull Up To the Bumber.  There is a reviewer who cites that the 12" version is on this compilation.  Well I hate to bust your bubble but that is not so.  There were 3 different 12" mixes.  The two that came out in 1982 do not sound like the snippet you hear here on Amazon!  One of those mixes was  an instrumental dub mix!  Ok now the popular 12" mix that was out stated out with just the beat. Then Jones comes in with "Walking down those city streets..." At this point it is only here vocal and the beat. As she progresses into the first verse the bass comes up and a and maybe another instrument but the music is still minimal, not fully up as you hear on the snippet.  Ok, so what was the third 12" mix?  That version came out in 1985 and it had a different overall mix quality to it.  The version on this compilation is in fact the LP version.		All in all, however; this is a great collection of dance songs that were popular in the 80's but if you're looking for the remixed 12" versions of most of what is on here, you won't find them here except for songs 7, 8 and 10
1,I admit I surrendered to curiosity and bought this album, even knowing that an album written and released under such conditions would inevitable be bad.	I don't follow much closely the rivalry between Axl and his past friends from the real Guns N' Roses so, if this was a good album, it would be enough for me, howerer wrote or played in it.	But miracles don't happen anytime... The album is simply the sum of its parts: a lot of musicians, studio gimmick, producers, engineers... It simply does not sound like a band. The song lascks sctructure, they seem patched together like a Frankestein.	Also, in this case, the 16-year waiting was a negative marketing device, not a positive one, because people expected so much.		Anyway, I don't think the album is a complete throwaway. It has its (few) moments, but nothing to make an impression at all, absolutely nothing to even como close to the old Guns N' Roses catalogue.
1,After two amazing albums and a lenghty hiatus Lily Allen returns with her third album "Sheezus", after the wonderful lead single "Hard Out Here" my expectations for the album here high. Then came the album's opening and title track and I am like ok cool little song intil she started going on and on about her period and than the song went downhill. Then the was the next track "L8r Commer" when you listening to just the backing track its sounds cool and intil you start listening to the listening which are just awful, so by track three you have already lost interest in her album and somehow have gone back to listening "Alright, Still" or "It's Not Me, It's You". Just do yourself a favor just stick to those two great albums and forget that she released this one and wait ever patiencely for her fourth.
1,I have this DVD and, as others have said, aside from the "bonus" feature featuring David Ruffin sound-alike Garfield Fleming backing William "Poogie" Hart, this is a clear waste of money. The problem is not Poogie Hart - it is the poor choice in backing singers he made to replace Garfield Fleming and the just-as-talented Johnny Johnson featured on the majority of this disc. Aside from the 3 members who backed him during their heyday (his brother Wilbert, Randy Cain and Major Harris), Garfield Fleming and Johnny Johnson were the best singers he ever had backing him. Save your money and buy "The Big Show" and the 3 part "70's Soul Jam", both of which feature the two of them and give you the kind of quality show the Delfonics were famous for. And you will love Garfield's cover of "My Girl" as well as Poogie's rap and reggae ad libs on "The Big Show"! (Also, noteworthy are current Stylistics member Eban Brown's performances when he was part of William's brother Wilbert's group).
1,As momma used to say:	You can dress a pig up in beautiful clothes, but it does not make her a lady.		(I've given it one star, because there is no option for zero stars)
1,There are many Floyd fans who will give 5 stars to, and genuinely love, any band member's solo release. If you are a Floyd fan but also a discerning and critical listener, you'll probably want to check out this album. Just don't expect it to last long on your turntable/playlist.		Now, personally, I love Wright's contributions to Floyd, circa 1969-1977. And when I have the itch to listen to the music I wish Wright could have made as a solo artist, I turn, not to Wright's solo albums, but to Brian Eno. Typical of reviews in the 1970s, one critic wrote in a review of one of Eno's albums: "What a wonderland of a zoo, a cross between steaming smoke, atonal mystery and hanging, frothy ditties... This is another typically awesome, stunning, numbing Brian Eno album -- the record Pink Floyd could make if they set their collective mind to it."		Not sure why more Floyd fans aren't Eno fans. Check out "Another Green World," "Apollo," "Here Come the Warm Jets," "Taking Tiger Mountain," "Discreet Music," "Music for Airports," "Music for Films," "Before and After Science," and especially (after "Another Green World") David Bowie's "Low," made with Eno. Sorry, fans, but this is the music Wright should've made.		Now a disclaimer. Eno's music began to change in the late 70s, during the period when he began collaborating with the Talking Heads (and Devo, and later, U2). The music was typically awesome, but less and less "Floydian."
1,Did not like it, I expect Loretta singing.
1,Yes is one of those bands that doesn't age very well.  Pompous and arty, with not much of a beat.  Jon Anderson's voice is pretty annoying too. Even the pop songs like Sweet Dreams are pretty much unlistenable.  If you are into exploring the relationship of man and the universe or fathers and sons with dimestore philosophy and dramatic organ music, or need something to listen to while you are playing dungeons and dragons by all means get this record.  Otherwise stay away from it!
1,This is without a doubt KISS'S WOOORRST album(cringe!)I cannot	not even begin how Cheezy and forgetful this album can be.	It's not even good when you compare it to the music it is like	Barry Manilow,and The Carpenters! Kiss was so into themselves	at this point that there was no turning back! And they really	did not care as long as they had the GIRLS and the DOUGH! Who	cares what the fans want!!!Well lucky for us KISS was always there	and WOKE UP! to are screams(the classic 82 CREATURES..though where's	my ACE?)Please if you are buying this do not! I repeat DO NOT!!!	OPEN THIS DRIVEL! just put on your shelf right between DYNASTY	and Music from the Elder and yes your coll.is complete for that is the	only reason to own this! Seriously this makes CRAZY NIGHTS sound like	HOTTER THAN HELL(did I just write that?)Remember this is for completis	only you have been WARNED! UNMASKED!!MORE LIKE UNOPEN! This-this-this	is POO-POO!
1,I receive this compact Discs for Christmas from a Co-worker. I did appreciate it but this compact disc is very boring and slow for the music of the who and put you to sleep fast. I'm glade that I receive it as a gift and I don't have the gluts to tell the person that gave it to that the disc sucks at all cost. Please don't 24 years again put out trash Peter for this is You better you bet a Bad CD and a sleeping pill from you
1,I have to admit I didn't like this CD at all. It only had a few song that I knew and all the rest I'd say came from the B side. I love music, all music but this just didn't satisfy me at all..
1,Another band that used to kick a**. This album is filled with mediocre riffs and horrible vocal melodies. Pick up Legacy of Kings or Chapter IV instead.
1,When 11-17-70 was originally released in April 1971, it was significant for showing those who were buying Elton's records but hadn't yet seen him live that he was just as incredible a performer as he was a songwriter! This album may not have succeeded in its mission, but only because its sales paled in comparison to the slew of other Elton albums released in 1971-- Tumbleweed Connection, the Friends soundtrack and Madman Across the Water. 11-17-70 also had vinyl bootlegs to contend with, many of which included the entire radio concert from which the album was culled, as opposed to the mere six songs on the official release.	Until this album was remastered by Elton's (mainly) 70s producer, Gus Dudgeon, it was Elton's greatest live album and one of his best albums overall. In April 1971, people could clearly hear the mania in his singing and playing; indeed, every piano note came to the surface with aggressive abandon. Elton's non-verbal exclamations were also in abundance, as were multitudinous audience screams and clapping. Until Gus remastered it, 11-17-70 had a quality that increased one's heart rate and level of exhilaration before the first song was over! But Gus has erased the excitement by lowering the brightness of Elton's piano, muffling many of his non-verbal exclamations as well as those of the audience and erasing much of the clapping. What a horrible disappointment!	I would advise anyone interested in hearing this album who owns a functioning turntable to seek out the vinyl. If all you've got is a CD player, try the Polydor CD. Forget about this remaster!
1,Speaking as a pre-<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Play/dp/B00000J6AG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Play</a>&nbsp;fan, I was happy to hear that Moby was getting "back to his roots", and was really looking forward to this album.

Although not completely awful (I Love to Move In Here, Everyday It's 1989, and The Stars are fairly redeeming), the album sounds like someone else's idea of what a Moby album should sound like.
1,Goes in one ear and straight out the other. Close to unlistenable...if this is the best of Waters on its own, I shudder to think how bad the others must be. This is nakedly derivative. Songs about the corruption of the soul by money and war...hm. I think we've heard this before, Roger. It bears repeating perhaps, but this showcase is poor. Melodies, if you can call them that, cop from previous Floyd works. The lyrics don't save the day either, they seem facile and contrived for the most part. Waters' voice can't reach the manic levels of the decade preceding this release either, robbing the content of urgency.		I agree with every sentiment in this album. I think we monkeys are amusing ourselves to death, but one will not find much of that amusement here. Granted, that's not Waters' goal, but what I'm saying is the style/execution doesn't connect to the listener. Throw that on top of recycled thematic content and it's plain to see that Roger might want to look into a painting career instead of tarnishing his musical legacy with mediocre songwriting.
1,This is some depressing music that make me wanna commit suicide. Nirvana, one of the most self loved and overrated bands ever. How ROLLING STONE ranked them higher than the WHO in their 100 best artists list is a mystery to me. AVOID PLEASE AND KEEP YOUR BRAIN CELLS FRESH.
1,Decent album.
1,god you people who actually enjoy this album are lame. i wouldn't even enjoy the album if it was released by another artist. but the fact that i know this is atreyu, and i know they were once a pretty good hardcore/metalcore band makes me even more pissed. Why would you wanna let down your loyal fans like that?? i can see if they were slowly progressing with each album, and eventually ended up sounding like this, but to just completely do a 180 from your last record is too much. it was just like BANG!! "hello, we're atreyu and we all of the sudden decided that we wanna be wussies now. sorry", i mean dang, there is hardly any screaming on this album, and at one point they even use a steel guitar! Listen to the last track. i laughed my butt off in disbelief. you wanna know what caused this band to go down the tubes?? THE THEFT! that song ruined this band. that happens to too many bands. they get that taste of success from a hit single, and they completely change there sound to appeal to the mainstream. its not about the money guys. its about the music. oh, and atreyu, if by some odd chance you happen to read this -"F**K YOU!! You money craving pussies!"
1,I'm sorry, but how does this garbage sell??I guess sales prove nothing, because after listening to this, I couldn't believe there were people, adults, who actually loved this. I don't mind the idea of some light-hearted music, and I didn't expect no Joni Mitchell, but this is just ridiculous. I mean cmon, I admit this cd is catchy at times, but the cheap,80's production, and the absolutely atrocious lyrics ruin it for me completely. Ka Ching?Nah?Waiter, bring me water?Honestly did you ever think you'd live to the day when songs had titles like the ones above. And with all the money, and all the contacts, they're not able to make it sound like it was even produced in a professional studio. The production is some of the worst I've ever heard in my life. Shania's voice is fairly decent, but has no depth, or range, and isn't capable of taking on a different lilt, and we all know that if it wasn't for her husband, that Shania would still be stuck in some Northern Ontario Bar. Now, even though I'm no country fan, I was intrigued by the idea of the same songs, just in country versions. Let me tell you somethin' sweetheart:throwing a little fiddle into the mix does not make music country. It was obviously just a marketing ploy to appeal to her long and forgotten country fans, and to other people like me who were simply curious. This is a tacky,tasteless piece of junk with zero effort or imagination.
1,First of all - I need to make something clear. I own dozens of DCC & AF remastered CDs (the same company, basically) and I think most of them are superb, far better than their original counterparts. Examples? Elton John Greatest Hits, Hotel California, The Cars, The Original Soundtrack; I love them all.		Lately, though, the company has been producing pretty bad products. From the terrible sounding "The Pretenders", to the gaps that never existed on "Heartbeat City" (and the defective HDCD encoding, too!), to the defective Doors CDs - Audio Fidelity is not what it used to be at all. Plus, the fact that they don't even use master tapes anymore (they had to remove the slogan "From the original master tapes" after it was demonstrated they weren't using them, anyway) while the big labels use them all the time, and competition from the original producer of 24K CDs, Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs,  has made AF irrelevant nowadays.		Nevertheless, I gave Rebel Yell a try, since I only own the older "24 bit" remaster, which sounds pretty dull and no-noised. Surprise, surprise. The AF Rebel Yell sounds as dull as the remaster, and it definitely has exaggerated, muddy bass. Which is interesting, since the head engineer for DCC always accuses other labels in his forum of using a "Smiley face" EQ - I guess he uses a Sylvester Stallone sneer on his products nowadays.		No detail whatsoever - to use "audiophile" terms, there's no "air", no "sparkle" on the recording. It's dull and lifeless, and the bass makes you think you are listening to a boombox (and yes, my equipment is "resolving" enough, although I'm not listing it here! Trust me on this one). The only thing that sounds just about right is the midrange, but who cares when there are no highs to speak of, and the bass takes your attention away from anything else, anyway? Any compilation CD with Idol's songs sounds better than this CD.		I know that an "audiophile rock recording" is an oxymoron, but there was a time when you could expect any DCC / AF CD to sound better than its original counterpart. Not anymore. I guess someone's hearing has gone to the toilet, because things aren't what they used to be. Definitely not recommended.
1,My only reason to add a review of this disc is that I don't understand all the praise lavished on it by others. At least four recordings of this piece (Previn, Davis, Dutoit and Shaw, in ascending order of preference) are so much better than this one on so many counts as to render it totally uncompetitive as far as I'm concerned. Of course the playing and singing are excellent, what else would you expect, and as this is a concert registration I'm not too bothered by an occasional lapse in ensemble. But it's all so POLITE, so clean and so bland that it just kills the music. It may be pleasing to the ear, but it has very little to do with Berlioz! The Tuba Mirum is reduced to a mere interesting sound effect, while the quieter passages drag on monotonously, Ozawa failing to grasp opportunities to bring out Berlioz's magical scoring at every turn; -  and that anybody would be able to deliver such a flaccid reading of that juggernaut of a Lacrymosa seemed inconceivable, and yet here it is: drained of energy, grey and unexciting. The recording registers the coughs from the audience rather clearer than much of the instrumental detail. It sounds congested and distant. All in all, eminently forgettable - this piece deserves much better!
1,This album was disappointing to me.  The only good songs are the ones on the radio - the others to me are just filler.  Instead of buying the album, just download your favorites.  My pics:		S&M	Whats My Name	Only Girl In The World	Love the Way You Lie
1,Anyway, this CD is overrated.  Avoid this, and avoid any reviewer who names himself after dead rock stars.  They can't be trusted.
1,I'm glad I'm not the only one who isn't afraid of telling it like it is...this just isn't an exciting CD. The songs are actually good...I'll give them that. They're original and fresh sounding. However, I wanted to hear more upbeat, harder edged material...there's just too many slow and soft songs on this CD...BORING. Come on, Trucks/Tedeschi...let's hear you guys tear it up! And I agree about the huge band being wasted...it's just not used enough. The brass hardly makes a real showing, and Mike Mattison is not featured enough on vocals, IMO.		Trucks and Tedeschi seem to have settled into a happy little rut here. I think it's great that they're enjoying playing with each other in the same band, but they need to start fighting so that the music can get more exciting!--lol. ROCK IT UP next time, guys!
1,Creed's break-up was so predictable after this CD was released.  This sounds nothing like the old Creed.  When "My Own Prison" was released, Creed was known as hard rock/alternitave/grunge.  Then when Human Clay was released, they started going the opposite direction with radio-friendly slow songs like "Higher" and "With Arms Wide Open".  Now on this album, Creed has completely sold-out by turning almost every song into the same sound that got played on the radio.  Instead of a few slow songs and the rest hard, Creed has now made a whole CD full of "Higher" and "With Arms Wide Open".  Every song on this CD sounds almost the same.  When I bought this CD like 3 years ago, I said to myself "This is it for Creed."  And I was 100% right.	The only other topic I would like to address is that, despite what people tell themselves and what MTV and the news tell people, Creed IS NOT--and I repeat--IS NOT a "Christian-Rock" band.  Did anyone ever see or pay attention to them whenever they were being interviewed and the topic was brought up?  Scott Stapp's almost exact words were "I don't know what people have been saying, but we are certainly not a Christian-Rock band. The messages in our songs can be looked at differently in a certain point-of-view that could be related to religion, but we are not a Christian-Rock band. Our songs are about finding your true self and talk about the search for "the right path" in life."	--Now, those were not the exact words, but they were on the same lines as that.  So why everyone just completely ignores what the actual creator of the songs tells people is beyond me.  But anyone with half a brain and doesn't think that they are right and know the asnwers to everything--you should know that Creed is NOT a "Christian-Rock Band" and do not pay any attention to retards who think or tell you that they are because they are dead wrong.	Over-all, "Weathered" was a weak album.  "Human Clay" was weak as well, but better than "Weathered".  "My Own Prison" was the only good album that Creed was able to put out.  For any new-comers to Creed, Ignore "Human Clay" and "Weathered" and just go for "My Own Prison".  It's for your own good.	--Any comments, feel free to e-mail me at rambobodes14@hotmail.com--
1,The biggest problem with this Thrice album is that the songwriting is pretty weak. Actually, an even BIGGER problem is how the songs try to attach themselves emotionally to the listener, but that's a pretty tough task when all the songs have vocal melodies similar to Radiohead and, more importantly, old U2 albums. We can just listen to those bands instead. Sometimes I think U2 deserves to be mentioned as an even bigger influence than someone like the Beatles, because it seems like EVERYONE nowadays wants to sound like U2.		Anyway, yeah, the singer wants you to feel what he's feeling, and he wants your emotions to get caught up in the music he's making, but truthfully, the music's just not good enough for that to happen.		The opening song sounds like a typical commercial alternative rock song that those supposed "heavy metal" stations play on the radio nowadays. "The Sky is Falling" tries to rock out, but has a boring and predictable vocal melody that just plods along, preventing any kind of rocking out from ever happening. "A Song For Milly Michaelson" sounds like a Red Hot Chili Peppers ballad.  "Daedalus" is downright awful.  By the four minute mark, the vocal melody is almost complete noise and just terrible.		The lyrics are above average though, so the album gets two stars instead of one.		This stuff is certainly not anything special to me, but hey, if you're someone who likes U2, you might be interested in this band.
1,The playing aside guess I just don't like the music.
1,Similar to some of the songs she songs with the Velvet Underground, but didn't hold my attention long term like the classic VU stuff.
1,This cd sucks, the music all sounds the same, the vocals sound just as bad live as they do in studio, the riffs are generic, the lyrics are dumb and the sound over all sucks.
1,Hovhaness is good at his best.  But the loon lake symphony is a great disappointment because nothing on the recording sounds the least bit like a loon despite the commissioning society's request to have that sound evoked for the listener.  If what I heard on track 7 is supposed to represent the cry of a loon, the composer should have refreshed his memory in the woods.
1,This is lowbrow electronica at its worst!  There is not a single innovative or interesting thing on this album.  Poor production and overall cheesiness reign supreme on this waste of perfectly good plastic.  If you are a serious fan of good electronic music, save your time and money - don't buy this!	 In case anyone is interested, I took this CD to three music stores to trade it in and no one would even take it.
1,Didn't like this cd at all. Not typical Lisa Stansfield, a fine blue-eyed soul singer.
1,I bought this without hearing any clips.  Relying on glowing reviews, with this line up of killer musicians, surely this would be an exciting album, right?  On my first listen I felt ill.  This sounded nothing like anything these musicians have done previously.  I didn't want a Dregs-Theater-Trans-Beard sounding album.  I wanted something different, creative, and inspiring.  It is different... this is a bland pop/rock album, not the type of music I would label as creative and inspiring.  If you like Coldplay or Muse this could be worth a listen.		So then I tried to listen to this as though it was a new band that I had no previous experience with.  That didn't help.  This is not the type of music I enjoy.  The playing is good but the music is weak and the hooks are cheesy.  The instrumental section of "Infinite Fire" is awesome, but when the vocals come back in the tune sinks.  I hear very little influence from Steve or Dave and think they were just doing what Mike and the producer told them to play.  What a shame and a wasted opportunity.  To me this project feels rushed, even the final mix sounds harsh.		There have been some great supergroup projects - UK, The Aristocrats, Frost*, and Transatlantic.  This project could have been better if it wasn't the MP solo album and more color was input from the other musicians.
1,It is with great regret that I am writing a review stating that "Haunted Cities" continues the pattern of Rancid and company's decline.  This new Transplants record is another chapter among the 2003's de-volving "Indestructible" and the ego-a-thon that is Frederiksen's 2004 "Viking" (my least favorite record of 2004 hands down).		This record is suffering greatly in the lyrics department.  Along the lines of "Viking," this album's lyrics are just a tad above because they touch on politics (Apocalypse Now and American Guns).  But, rest assured, you will find that nearly every other song is talking about bad-ass they are, how hard their life has been, etc.  Where is the storytelling style that Tim Armstrong used to incorporate into songs so well?  Not here.		Remember how "Skinhead" Rob was a cool addition on the first Transplants album, and not a crucial member?  Well, that has changed on this record.  In fact, the record ought to be called "Rob Austin and the Transplants - Haunted Cities." You'll find Rob's raspy, smokes-too-much vocals singing the main parts of most of the songs, and coving about 70% of the lyrics in total.  I could deal with this if there was some content to his lyrics, but nearly every line he says has to do with him being tough, a drug dealer, or using some random cuss word.  This "we're so hard" thing has really gone to their heads.		If you'll recall on the first Transplants album the guest stars fit on the songs very well.  From Lars, to Brody, and even Davey Havok, these guests were long time friends and they fit their parts perfectly.  This is not the case on "Haunted Cities," you'll find every guest is now some "gangster" from the LA rap scene rapping about how hard he is, and it just seems ridicules-I can't take it seriously.  Where is the honesty? B Real's part on "What I Can't Describe," as well as the whole song, is beyond laughable.		There are a few highlights worth mentioning.  "Crash and Burn" has a great Latin dance beat and is incredibly catchy, "Apocalypse Now" has a good hard chorus worth hearing, "Madness" has a great hook in the chorus which is probably one of Tim's best, and the politically charged (sounds like a Clash song on many levels) "American Guns" is worth hearing.		2 Stars because four songs worth listening to, but this is overall a non creative, ego boasting, repetitive record.  Get the songs I recommend off I-Tunes and save your $15.
1,Ravin should stop compiling buddha-bar cds !! his best remains vol 3, there is no more inspiration, making the last two buddha-bar less than average.	Visan or Popat or even a new DJ should make the next one. i hope this gets read by the georges V people .
1,I wasn't too big of a Katy Perry fan until she released California Girls w/ Snoop Dog. I felt like that was a hot track, and it was different for her to be pared with a legendary rap artist such as snoop dog. It's weird with this album, most the commercial singles are really good but the rest of the album falls extremely flat compared to her first release. I felt like she really sold out, which can be good in some ways, bad in others. When I listened to the whole release through, I felt like a lot of lyrics and dance beats were really immature. In fact, I feel that Kesha has at least better beats in her music. I will say that I really like the vocals on Teenage Dream and Firework. It took a while for me to catch onto Firework, but it actually works well. It's nice to her good singing and dance beats like Blake Lewis's Binary Love. It reminds me of a lot of the old school R n B that I like. Peacock just sounded awful and that one song about partying on Friday Night was garbadge compared to some her other radio hits. I would only suggest buying on the singles on this album. It really didn't desearve to have 3 No. 1 hits, but Katy Perry's not that bad of a singer.
1,Hey, that just goes without being said. All of their live albums suck because they suck. Go Creed! I can't wait for Scott Stapp's solo album! Awesome, baby!
1,Yeah, you read that right, Nu Metal terror. To me, The Cure have always been an emotional band that envolks emotions within the listener, a band with meaningful lyrics and well-though-out songs. This new, self-titled album by the Cure was one of the worst albums by an older band I have ever heard. Disintegration was, obviously, the high point of The Cure's career, and ever since then the band has either been trying to sway as far away from the Disintegration sound as possible, or has tried to resurrect the Disintegration song-writing talent. Either way, The Cure have failed miserably with each and every attempt (although Wish was a good album, with such greats as Letter To Elise and Friday I'm In Love, and Bloodflowers has its moments, though few and far inbetween).		  Anyway, this album only has 3 or 4 songs that are tolerable. Lost is decent, though repetitive, End of The World is okay a few times, but that too gets extremely repetitive. There are a few other tracks which are decent, but their names elude me. To be honest, I haven't listened to this album for a while, and don't plan to any time soon. All of the songs are pretty basic and plain, and use Nu Metal riffs. The lyrics aren't really meaningful, just plain old angst. Sure, angst has worked for the Cure with older albums, but it's time for these guys to get their act together. They don't have anything to be depressed about, they have had their hay days. To me, the Cure is almost at the same level now as Papa Roach or Linkin Park or any other lame angsty band. I am not a big fan of "come-back" albums by old bands, mainly because they usually suck, but I had hope for this one. After hearing "End of The World" I thought it might be allright, but I was left extremely disappointed and let-down by one of, if not my favorite band. Get Ready by New Order was pretty good, and so was Brave New World by Iron Maiden, but this album just plain reaks failure. I would complain about blowing 20 bucks on this cd, but then again in life you have to take chances, and I guess I lost this time.
1,'Member the days when the cats were Mad Fer It, mates?  Those days are long over, it seems.  Liam's croaky voice has been busted up by too much booze and too many cigarettes, while his flat-faced brother, poor Noel, couldn't write a decent guitar lick these days if John Lennon's ghost appeared in his bedroom with hand-written instructions.		Poor Oasis.  They were once so great.  This new record sounds straight outta 1965, for old fogies only.  That's too bad.  I remember when these guys were armed (with guitars) and dangerous (with attitude).  Now they are just middle-aged millionaires who make British compatriots Def Leppard look young and edgy.		What happened, guys??  Let's bring it back to what it was.  Maybe one day soon the cats'll be Mad Fer It once again.		P.S. IS BLUR REUNITING??????????????
1,I'm having a hard time understanding why everyone is raving about this CD. I played this CD at least ten times and still couldn't comprehend it. I'm a HUGE Yes fan, so for me I'll have to stick with their more innovative and rewarding works such as "Fragile", "Close to the Edge", "The Yes Album", "90125" and even "Talk" for that matter. My advice is to take a pass on this one.
1,Wheel Blues. While I absolutely love their last release Lost In The Dream, I can't say the same about Wagonwheel Blues. I didn't like anything on it. But I hope this won't deter anyone from buying Lost In The Dream. I can't stop listening to it. Addictive!!!!
1,Here we are again. I wanted to review this disk again and give it another chance due to all negative feedback from my first review. The second time around is still not the charm for me. While I really like the new album (Harnessing Ruin) and Unholy Cult, this album is just boring.  I saw Immolation live in Sac Town and they can produce a lot of noise on stage. They are a band you really have to pay attention too while listening to their music. I will give 2 stars and leave it at that. That's 1 more star than last time because I found at least 1 track that was memorable. This is by no means Immolation's best work.
1,I miss the Floyd as they used to be;an introspective, experimental, phycadelic group who were not afraid to venture slightly beyond the realms of normal human understanding and experience. I just can't feel that much sympathy for Waters here, and the lyrics, while beautiful and poetic at times, do not convey subtle or layered messages, as his lyrics used to. Personally, I'd much rather listen to "Take up Thy Stethascope and Walk", which is an insanely dark song compared to this material. It seems like pretty much the only tradgity Waters has to go on is the death of his father when he was three months old. While that is certainly tragic, hey, my friend lost her dad when she was 11, which I think would be alot harder. Finally, I have a guestion to ask. After hearing this album for the first time, did anyone here say to themeselves "God Syd, I wish you were here".?
1,Unfortunately prob. the worst album from this pioneering band.
1,Jesus, how incredibly boring can a band get? Well, self loathing, pretentious metalheads Anathema have no competition here. This album can put you to sleep in under 15 minutes with its repetitive, stoic, cardboard tunes.
1,May have to give another listen or two but first impression, not great.  Obviously talented band, but they tend to go overboard with symphonic arrangements. Songs tend to lose focus and go off track.
1,The best Sammy CD?  Are you kidding?  I just spent $30 to hear a truncated (albeit totally swinging) "Come back to me".  And "The Witch is dead?"  You'd need to be a complete ding-dong if you can't find a better way to honour this man's legend.  A waste o' time and money.	Invest, instead, in "Live at the Cocoanut Grove" and truly experience just what Sam is all about.  This cat swings with the best of them and, when he's loose, he's better than you can possibly imagine.
1,I'm a huge Ak fan. After his first album though... he kinda fell off lyrically. This ep has a couple of songs on it where Ak is doing Ak, but he just went to much with the stupid sex raps and club jams. It's hard to really show off your talent when you make music that requires none. "In the world" and "Robbery song" are dope. The other three songs are probably what you bought it for. Good but not great. Just, don't put it in your mouth. 2 1/2 stars
1,poor quality
1,Having been a big fan of the Clash, I was excited to finally see a documentary about the Great Joe Strummer. However, this documentary is NOT it. This documentary is filled with nonsense video imagery that has nothing to do with Joe Strummer. It's like watching an old episode of the classic ABC Saturday morning TV show, "Make a Wish", where they talk about a subject and show lots of cutting room visuals that meander in and out to follow the narration. This documentary consists of Joe's friends sitting in front of a cmmpfire and talking about Joe, while scrap film from the cutting room floor is used to "illustrate" their comments. If they talk about Joe being born in Turkey, the film shows some old footage of Turkey; they mention one of Joes friends named Woody, and then they show footage of Woody Guthrie. WTF??? Absolutely one of worst documentaries ever made. This is not a documentary on Joe Sturmmer; it's some bloke's art film project. If you want to see a great documentary about Joe and the Clash, see Westway to the World, not this P.O.S.!
1,What went wrong?		As an avid listener of Enya since 1988 (when I first saw "Orinoco Flow" on the UK Show Top of the Pops), it disappoints me that she could release something this sub-standard and mediocre. Where is the beauty of "Watermark" and "Shepherd Moons"? We all know that Enya likes to stick to her formulaic music, which is a good thing because she can do it well, and has created some beautiful songs in the process.		Remember "Ebudae", "On My Way Home" and "Storms in Africa"? Those were byproducts of the genius that is Enya and her dream team of Roma and Nicky Ryan. On this new album, even though the same team is in place, things go awfully wrong. I would put this down to Enya's inability to move with the times. Now, an artist need NOT move with the times, but when you're making World Music, instrumentation is key, and the problem is, the last five years have seen some amazing world music and Celtic Music releases, that makes this album feel like a footnote in Enya's career, rather than a standout release.		I seriously think that Enya's real-life sister Maire Brennan's last album was infinitely better than this. First of all, Enya's voice has never sounded more vocoded or `computerized' than here. The lush melodies wash over it, and though its possibly as beautiful as ever, I have to wonder why they did this to her voice. Secondly, its as if the producers took the same songs from her last album "A Day Without Rain", and rehashed the SAME melodies for this record. Which is fine, but some of these songs sound exactly the same as the last album. Come on Enya, is this the best you can do?		Apparently it is, because lead single `Amarantine' is dead upon arrival. Just listen to it. Its silly, nonsensical, dentist waiting-room muzak, and its not even dressed up passably. The worst part of it is that if you thought Enya's lyrics were meaningless and `filler', you have no idea how pointless the lyrics on this album are. I hate to rain on Enya's parade, but this simply won't do. At one point I thought that this album was probably one of those albums that artists HAVE to record simply to fulfill a record contract obligation (much like Tori Amos' "Strange Little Girls" - an abomination in its' own right).		At the end of it, the whole album comes off as a curious piece that has no business being released in this day and age. The last year has been especially miserable for lovers of true world music, as this tepid CD was followed by the even more misguided `An Ancient Muse' by Loreena McKennitt. Now, Enya and Loreena both have their core audiences, but they seem to have left their true musical roots and genius back in the 1990s (Enya had her masterwork "Shepherd Moons", while Loreena had her "The Mask and Mirror"). Now, these two artists sound like has-beens from a bygone era, and they most certainly seem to have `lost it'. I would say that you can skip this mind-numbingly pointless album, and check out Enya's back-catalog - most of her `90s albums are fantastic.		On this CD, Enya comes across as bored and lethargic, and the play-by-numbers approach certainly lends nothing special to the music. If that sort of thing is your bag, you might want to check this out (be warned though, that even severe Enya addicts have quit her after the release of this monstrosity).		Two Stars. Not Recommended. A huge letdown for World Music.
1,I consider this album a transitional one for DM...one where they began to leave behind the cute, juvenile light synth-pop of their first two albums and move towards a more evolving, mature sound.  Unfortunately, as with any transitional album, it is very hit and miss.	First, the good.  "Everything Counts", though not having aged particularly well, remains a Depeche classic, especially with its memorable, singalong chorus.  The lyrics were somewhat naive, but Martin was at least moving beyond "See You" and songs of that nature.  "And Then...", the album closer, is probably the best song on the album.  Well-written, thoughtful lyrics, and a nifty 12 string guitar part to boot, it's definitely one of the most listenable tracks from the early days.  "Love, In Itself" is acceptable, but contains one of the most annoying synth horn lines ever recorded.	The rest of the album, however, falls short of the apparent goals DM were trying to reach.  "Pipeline", a song noted amongst the electronic world as a revolutionary song because of it's liberal use of samples, is unfortunately also one of the most plodding, dreadful numbers DM have ever produced.  Samples or not, I find it extremely difficult to get through the first minute of this track.  Likewise, the dated synths and beats on songs such as "Told You So" and "More than a Party" (the latter having some of the worst lyrics ever penned by Mr. Gore) show a band that was making attempts to evolve musically, but had not yet found their feet.	Overall, this is not a "terrible" album, certainly an improvement over the embarassments that are their first two albums.  However, Depeche still had quite a ways to go before they could be considered a truly outsanding, and musically talented, band, a title which they would not earn until 1986's Black Celebration.
1,Patty has a naturally minor key sad voice, and uses it effectively on this album, but the lyrics are really downbeat and I just don't like her voice on a lot of them. I miss the Patty of "Flaming Red."
1,When the supporting cast from such b-movie inspired bands as Rob Zombie and Powerman 5000 get together, the end result would expectedly land somewhere around Troma funded quality. With their debut effort "Blah...Blah...Blah... Love Songs For The New Millennium", Scum Of The Earth don't even hit that relatively low mark. Assembling a collection of what could easily be mistaken as Rob Zombie/White Zombie b-sides, this album revels in a highly dated electro-metal sound that lacks the magnetism of the prime days of either band.		From the onset the listener is hit with displaced samples, chunky riffing and electronically augmented beats that revel in a futuristic sense of evil. Hooky choruses and driving rhythms are constantly attempted, yet without the charisma of one of the brothers Zombie at the helm they are quickly driven into the ground and hastily buried. Sure there are moments where this group deviate from the formula of their previous outfits, taking the time to develop an ominous soundscape or two. They even try their hand at a shaky ballad. But with such a derivative nature and little more creativity than that of a cover band being exercised (or does their gimmick call for exorcised?), not even the dead would be interested by what is offered up here, let alone the undead.		It's sad to see that these musicians are so adamant to stick to a sound that has more or less now run its course. Sure some of them were there to help perfect it, but you'd at least think they would try to continue to evolve it. This album is proof that they haven't and thus the listener is left with the same old skeletons in a barely renovated closet. From their flat pseudo-covers and borrowing of vocal patterns from groups like Queen ("Pornstarchampion") and INXS ("Murder Song") to the uninspired electro-industrial tinged dirges they dredge up on their own, this album is one of the blandest affairs to hit stores in recent memory. In fact, it's title should have been shortened to just "Blah...Blah...Blah...", because that sums up the material featured on it perfectly.
