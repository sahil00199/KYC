0,nice product
0,These were great! No problems. Kids love 'em.
0,Arrived timely. Easy to put together. So far working as described.  Will have to see if they are just as good in a year.
0,I was very impressed by the quality of this stamp. It is way nicer than anything you can find in craft stores and a fraction of the price of anything online. The stamps for our wedding invites came out great!
0,Really nice, good quality. They left out a few of the basic tools like "Vise Grips" etc. It does however come with blank labels so you can make your own.
0,Best Dot Matrix Printer Available!
0,great cards and I was very pleased but wish the envelopes were self sealing instead of the kind you had to lick
0,Old one (Brothers) stopped abruptly, even after the usual shaking and sliding at a bad time.  I had no time but quickly pulled the old one out, removed the orange cover, gave the slide a few rips and installed as instructed.  Maybe took a minute!  Wow, the printer took off and printed the page I needed!
0,Very sturdy and safe.  Have on the desk of a seven year old who frequently uses and has held up to heavy hands after now several months of use.  Good product for the money
0,Lovely but floppy/flexible thinner than expected.
0,As advertised.
0,I like to buy in "bulk for back to school if it's on their list we will need it at home best price available!
0,Nice size very convenient and multiple strands may be strung together if a longer key keeper.
0,Great colors, as always from Prismacolor.....however my head wasn't working when I bought this because if you own the whole set of Prismacolors, you already have these...nonetheless, it has given me spares so I am happy. Comes in a nice tin which is handy to have. I recommend this to people looking for skin tones if you don't already own all the Prismacolors.
0,Gelly Roll Stardust pens are so fun to use to accent over color or anything else.  I use them regularly in my coloring books and Project Life albums, as well as my art journal.  Gelly Roll are hands-down my favorite gel pens. I don't even bother trying other gel pens at this point.  I know I will just be disappointed after being spoiled by this brand
0,Great pen.
0,Great pencil set. You get to customize the color. You can coordinate your pencil with your outfit each day. The pieces move easily and the pencil works great. I think most students would like this as they like to make things match. Love it.
0,I like my new Canon wireless printer, but it was a little more difficult and time consuming to connect than other brand name printers I've had in the past.  Hence the 4-star rating.  However, I LOVE the wireless connection, because it works flawlessly and the printing quality is great.  It's so easy to print from my Mac, iPhone or iPad without the need of wires.  I can also copy and scan documents, and with "My Image Garden," I can create collages, cards, calendars and many other projects.  I am thoroughly enjoying my new printer.
0,I sew and needed a marking pencil.  When I saw this one I know it would be good, no more sharpening of pencils..whooray	This company's price was the best price I found.  It was delivered earlier than promised.  Could not ask for more.
0,Just what I was looking for which is provided in bulk quantities!
0,I purchased this presenter to replace an aging Logitech. The Logitech is longer and narrower, which fits better in my (small) hands. The Kensington has excellent range, the laser is bright and easy to see, and it's really nice that the buttons are illuminated -- they weren't on the Logitech. I also like the low battery warning -- also missing on the Logitech. I have been using this unit now for 3 months, and I would buy it again. Recommended.		** update 11/08/2014 **	I do like this presenter -- but, as another review mentioned, the battery life for the laser is terrible. I was going through batteries every 2 - 3 weeks, only using the laser some of the time! Back to the Logitech...
0,This pad does the job well. I've seen some reviews that complain about having too much ink. I've not had that problem, but it may have to do with having put too much ink onto the pad. Impressions are crisp and clean, even with a small, very finely detailed stamp.
0,Good buy for a basic school supply.
0,This is a great calculator once I figured out how to use it... .-. I'm smart....
0,Just like photo.
0,There's nothing like a brand new dry eraser marker with a nice tip. These markers have tons of ink and work well. The cleaner works nicely too.
0,It's a nice Pen.  The Jinhao 250 is the "Baby" of the Jinhao range, with a Metal but well ribbed and easy to hold onto. This NIb is probably a #5 nib and could be replaced with another if wanted, but o the whole it's not bad.  It's a wide Medium Nib Width, although the varying quality of Chinese Nibs makes this a guess.  Converter included, as is normal with these Chinese Pens.  The Pen barrel is made of Brass, or metal, which is well built.  Well worth the money!
0,As expected.
0,With the rapid pace of life these days and different schedules the only way we seem to be able to communicate these days is on the white board mounted on the kitchen cabinet door.  These great little markers make it so much fun to leave pictures and notes to each other. It adds an element of romance otherwise missing in our hectic lives. Try it you'll like it!
0,Great item
0,These are just right. I love the fact that you can just peel off your customers copy and the other copy stays attached for your records. Great product!!
0,Nice set!!
0,Great price
0,Great staple
0,Works great and will definitely be placing another order soon.
0,This well-rated machine fully lived up to expectations. Color copies are high-quality, the 33.3 kbps modem is faster than most (28.8) so faxes move along briskly. Document and graphics scanning is more than adequate, and included software lets you do basic touchups. The included OCR software accurately places editable text in a word processor for further editing [haven't challenged capabilies with more complex layouts such as newspapers or magazines, however]. After 3 months of moderate use, I'm still printing with the original cartridges [the two-way 'HP Director' shows how much ink remains in each cartridge--neat].	My one problem has been the flimsy plastic automatic document feeder (ADF) guide that inserts into the ADF with two little tabs. I never achieved a solid fit, so that each time the scanner lid was lifted, the ADF guide slid out. Eventually, one of the supporting feet broke off after yet another drop, so that the guide is even more unstable...this is a fine and solid machine, well-suited for a home office with useful software included. Do note this is an USB (not parallel) cable connection, so make sure your computer has USB.
0,JUST WHAT I NEEDED. FAIR PRICE FOR 2 CUBE PACKS. NICE VARIETY OF COLORS. FAST SHIPPING. PAPER IS LIGHTWEIGHT.
0,I agree with the reviewers who said it is hard to roll around on it, but it works fine for my purposes, I just use it to protect the carpet in front of my desk and so I just sit down and move the chair towards the desk. However, if you have a setup where you move your chair around alot, rolling back and forth from the desk to another work surface or printer then the rolling will be difficult and you may be better off buying a thicker mat. I also agree with the reviewers who said there was a strong smell, but it dissipates after a few days. The product comes rolled up but I had no difficulty getting it to lay flat on the carpet. For comparison purposes, the carpet I have is a low pile carpet similar to industrial office carpeting.
0,Love these! Good weight and stick. Would be nice if they pulled off a bit more cleanly but the colors are good and the tab makes them easy to find on the multiple pages of my planner.
0,Excellent quality prints, it's fast, easy to set up, the wireless is very responsive and the quality of the photos is fantastic!
0,I am glad I got this.
0,This is a great little shredder.  Its fast, quieter than most and its has separate slots for CD's.
0,great item, just as described, exactly what i needed at the cheapest price available A+++++++++++++
0,I've been wearing this product for 20 years; 8 hours every biz day. Bullet proof.
0,The printer has worked great.  The toner cartridges are very expensive, but I found re-manufactured replacement toner at Techno Gadget Geeks that are very affordable and work great.	Hank
0,I had wrist surgery on my dominant hand. I remembered I use these pencils to help kids learn to write and thought I'd try them for learning to write with my other hand. Works well!
0,Very nice quality. The split backer is very easy to remove, just as advertised.
0,ok
0,Great when you lay down pictures and want them to stick up on the page.  I like to layer paper and pictures and this gives a nice 3d effect.
0,Great for storing flat  documents and similar items on book shelves, especially if you don't have a lot of drawer space. Easy to put together and they pack up again when you don't need them.
0,Great laynards. Shared two with my coworkers. Sturdy material. Love the retractable laynard for office fob.
0,Works great with standard chalk. No more messy hands.
0,Awesome whiteboard erasers! Very practical and easy for my kids to use. I use them too for my work.
0,This is great, will keep me busy and out of trouble. Nicely done, thank you
0,I've used only the black and red to this point, but they loaded fine and don't appear to be leaking, like others. Clear, good coverage.
0,A++++++++++++
0,cheap - works great in my dell printer - would not know it's non branded. will purchase again when needed.
0,Great
0,They are just as good as the expensive ones at the trailer rental places.  They did the job for us.
0,does the job
0,The feed is now working properly. The suggested replacement cycle for the pick roller is 100,000 sheets and 50,000 sheets for the  pad assembly. Unfortunately, one or both of the original of these parts only made it to 24,000 sheets. If this happens again, the review will reflect.
0,The Palm m100 PDA has revolutionized the way I keep track of my appointments.  I can't imagine life without it! Using a stylus, you can easily enter appointments, phone numbers, to-do lists, etc. by writing in the small screen.  The handwriting recognition is less than perfect, but it has come a long way since PDA's were first introduced.  Most letters of the alphabet are straightforward to write, but a few (such as K, Q, and T) require specialized, although easily remembered, strokes. Numbers are intuitive, but punctuation requires a little more study.	You won't find tons of features on this model, but I find that I rarely use everything it DOES offer.  Its simple gray and black screen is easy to read in both bright and dim conditions.  Have an appointment next year?  A standing one every Tuesday?  No problem.  Navigating the calendar, from daily to monthly to yearly displays, is a breeze.  I frequently use the alarm feature to remind me of obligations I'm likely to forget - it can be set to go off a minute or several hours beforehand. With a push of a button, you can go to your address book, to-do list, appointment calendar, and a Palm stroke tutorial.  Icons on the screen itself take you to the overall menu, calculator, and search features.	You can synch the information entered on the Palm to your PC, so you'll have two updated copies of all your information.  (The Mac requires a little more finagling than does a PC, but is compatible.)	I highly recommend this for people who have not yet tried a PDA.  You won't be overwhelmed with bells and whistles, and yet you'll have more than enough features to suit your needs.  Its reasonable price also makes it attractive for students and people hesitant to carry expensive items around with them.
0,These are my favorite pens. In the store I've only seen a few colors together so when I saw this pack, I went crazy. Smooth, easy to hold, brilliant color, perfect.
0,This is an excellent stapler best suited for heavy-duty work, or daily office work. It can (apparently) staple up to 60 pages, which I haven't tried but I have tried around 40 and it was no obstacle. This stapler is a bit on the heavy side, so it is better suited to sit flat on the desk, rather than constantly holding it. You do need to purchase the longer staples for this to work as advertised and so far, I've had no jamming issues. I received the black with red version and I like the color combo, though that's not very important to me. This is one of the better staplers I've used, though it is on the pricier side. But like I said, depending on your needs, it may be ideal.
0,I have bought this ink several times over the years and never had a problem.
0,A+
0,Great product at a great price.  Good assortment of colors if you are looking to expand past the usual colors.
0,Works
0,Great product!!!
0,I had a blast smelling all the markers! Brings back childhood memories, but if course I couldn't keep them as per my kids.
0,Avery Translucent Durable Write-On Dividers, 5 Tabs are so helpful for quick and easy customization and organization.  Writing with a ballpoint pen or pencil is easy on this wonderful plastic surface. Write directly on the tabs. You can erase and reuse. The larger surface area of the tab design provides ample room for labeling. Durable plastic withstands frequent use. So much easier than trying to write on those tiny papers and then folding them in half and trying to squeeze into the old-fashioned tabs. (Later they would often fall out.) These nice, modern tabs will delight all students, teachers, record keepers, office managers, homemakers, collectors, crafters, cooks, anyone who likes to organize materials. They are three-hole punched ready for the binder.
0,Great value and good quality. I ordered about 7 of these. Nice and large for lots of paperwork.
0,Clean, functional.  Holds multiple cards
0,Great product
0,Comfy! No shin or bum soreness as sometimes happens with this kind of chair.
0,As expected
0,Product is great with speedy Shipping, Thank you!
0,My son needed a scientific calculator for his math class. This worked perfectly.
0,okay
0,This two sided pocket unit helps hold the TV control, the automatic lamp switch and cell phone for a handicap recliner in a family room setting.
0,works amazing I use prismacolor pencils and they are very soft the lead always use to break, since I purchased this pencil sharpener haven't broke one lead.... Love love this works wonderful
0,I wanted a way to organize my pencils, pens, scissors, etc. This is a good way to do that. The little drawer is good, I guess, but mostly I use the taller slots. It's sturdy and stays in place -- plastic versions of this product tend to skitter around the desk when you try to put things in or take them out. This mesh metal version stays in place.
0,Pretty simple to refill the cartridge, though getting the plug out was a bit more work to not damage than I expected.  It is pretty solidly in there.  So I pried slowly with a screwdriver until it lifted enough that I could grab it with pliers.  Re-setting the indicator is easy, but is also easy to have the parts pop off, so going slow makes sense as well.  Not impossible to figure out how things go back on, from available videos that show how to reset it, but better to be careful in the first place so it just takes rotating the indicator and putting the cover back on.		The toner works just fine, with the only difference I notice is there's a different smell than with OEM toner from the printouts.  But the printouts are just like OEM toner, which is what counts.  I don't know how many times the cartridge can be refilled until things start wearing out, but I'm definitely going to keep doing refills until I get performance issues.  It is so much cheaper than buying a new cartridge.
0,The quality and thickness of this paper is excellent and reasonably priced.  It is heavy enough to use for crafts such as card making.
0,Great box for my gel pens.
0,Excellent product.
0,Even though we use computers and related technology, coping with diverse bundles of paper is an unavoidable aspect of personal and professional life for many of us. In the past, I have struggled with corralling myriad documents using logic, structure, hanging files, a Sharpie and a large rubbish can.		About a year ago, a friend who seems to maintain organization painlessly suggested that I think of ways to make my trove of papers and related materials look appealing. I thought the advice deceptively simple, but tried it anyway. In came new thinking and colored hanging folders and plastic file folders and a label-maker; out went Post-its on which I scribbled labels. I was surprised at how much less arduous it has become to keep up with paperwork.		Aside from the ongoing challenge of setting aside time to maintain my system, my recent issue had been irritation with those snap-in hanging-file tabs -- bent corners, chewed-up insertion points (I can be impatient). These Pendaflex Ready Tab folders with their ingenious lift tabs let me reposition tabs on the fly, and better yet give me the option of double-tabbing, which means that the first folder of a section can serve double-duty, which conserves folders and saves space.		The design of these folders is streamlined to remove the fussiness of removable pieces, which can be more time-consuming to use and more prone to wear or loss. These folders are sturdy and have stood up to several months of near-daily access/use thus far. The colors are pleasant and bright, as indicated in the product image.
0,Ordered for work; no problems with printer.  We're a newspaper and lots of paper goes through our printer--proofs, etc.
0,We have been Epson printers for many years. Our all-time favorite is the Epson 3540 - it is a real work horse with tons of options.  The Epson 4550 is an awesome concept - a printer with nearly limitless ink!  How great is that? Even though we love the Epson 3540 it always seems like it is running out of ink... and the ink is expensive.  We thought the 4550 was a dream control... essentially a 3540 but with easily refillable ink cartridges! There was one problem... the 4550 is only half the printer of the 3540.		Notes-		  - While it has a smaller footprint - it really has a limited paper capacity. The 4550 probably holds a maximum of about 50 sheets of paper.		 - The 4550 does not have a separate SD card or USB slot. This kinda stinks because it requires that you to scan and save over the network.		- Print Speed - Not bad... not bad at all - it runs at about the speed of the 3540. The only issue that I have had is that it seems to have limited ram and takes a bit for the image to load into the memory off of the network.		- Image quality - very solid... for my untrained eye it looks about the same as the 3540. This is huge since because I was worried that the reusable ink.		- Screen/Controls- Not great... comparable to a low end economy printer.		- Fax- yeah you can send faxes... i have never used it though		- Copying - Probably the best use of the 4550. It is a great way and inexpensive way to make copies.		Final Verdict -  We love the fact that you can use ink bottle for refilling the cartridges, but the actual guts of the printer are about the same as low level entry level printer.		3 1/2 Stars
0,prints well
0,These pens are great. I really like that the tips are so fine. They write very smooth, and the colors are really pretty. I would like a few more blues or purples though.
0,Love the color.
0,I ordered 4 different brands of memory foam cushions recently to compare them:		1.  Dr. Frederick's.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dr-Frederick-s-Original-BreatheTEC-Memory-Foam-Post-Partum-Perineal-and-Prostate-Cushion-For-Men-and-Women/dp/B01D1QLGHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dr. Frederick's Original BreatheTEC Memory Foam Post-Partum, Perineal, and Prostate Cushion - For Men and Women</a>Expensive, most comfortable of all the ones I tested, on the soft side. Sitting down on it feels amazing, makes the hard folding chair feel like it is hugging the buttom! I bought 3 as gifts for husband to give to his siblings. Husband recently went on a family reunion, 5 hour drive. Half way there, his buttom was sore from sitting, so he pulled out a cushion and sat on it, buttom was fine after that. All three siblings loved the cushions, so I ordered another one for husband. 5 stars	2. Perfect Posture.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PERFECT-POSTURE-Memory-Foam-Seat-Cushion-One-Size-Fits-All-NeverFlat-memory-foam-CoolTec-side-mesh-1-Count-Package/dp/B014U9X4EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PERFECT POSTURE - Memory Foam Seat Cushion: One Size Fits All, NeverFlat memory foam, CoolTec side mesh, (1-Count Package)</a>&nbsp;Expenisive, looks similar to Dr. Frederick's, but much harder. Husband and sons don't like it because they prefer softer, but I like it. It fits the bottom nicely and feels good. 5 stars.	3. (This cushion) ComfiLife Coccyx. Medium priced. This is a different style seat cushion with extra coccyx support which my husband hates, but my sons and I like it! It's quite a bit cheaper than the first 2 cushions, but basically just as good. You have to be open minded about the coccyx (tailbone) support, though, and my husband finds it weird. It really pokes into the tailbone, seriously. 5 stars. Makes sitting on the floor while playing with baby a comfortable experience.	4. Cheap generic cushion with no name&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Seat-Cushion-Car-Seat-Cushion-Chair-Cushion-Sciatica-Cushion-Prostate-Cushion-Hemorrhoid-Cushion-Low-Back-Pain-Cushion-Tailbone-Cushion-Coccyx-Cushion-Patent-Pending/dp/B01AHMCQVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Seat Cushion - Car Seat Cushion - Chair Cushion - Sciatica Cushion - Prostate Cushion - Hemorrhoid Cushion- Low Back Pain Cushion - Tailbone Cushion - Coccyx Cushion - Patent Pending</a>&nbsp;I ordered it because it looks just like the first 2 expensive cushions in the picture but costs less than half, so I figured it should be almost as good. Well, it isn't! The whole family hate it! Super uncomfortable, the design is bad, like a really bad copy. Smaller than the expensive cushions and doesn't fit the bottom at all. 1 star. Returned to Amazon. I don't normally return stuff as long as I can use it, but there's no use for that thing unless you like being uncomfortable.

0,Great Deal!	I've seen a dozen count of sharpies go for $10-$15, especially in art stores.		Grab this item.	The ink in all 12 have been tested, and all seem fresh.		Thanks	Bucky Wilson	[...]
0,Glad I switched fro HP and Lexmark to all Epson printers and faxes. This cartridge has went thru about 700pages with varying degress of print. Always sharp and no drying out in a week of no use
0,I love this ink, I originally place a big order of different sample ink with the Goulet Pen Company as starting out I wanted to make sure I absolutely loved the inks Ive purchased as the bottles are huge, so its a big ink comitment. This is my second bottle form Noodler's I find you get a lot for your bucks, he has an amazing color variation, he is one guy so basically a small company and its made in the USA. All things that I like to support when I have the chase. Out of all of my sample purchase this was the only bottle I need to have, its such a different color, theres hidden notes of green with in the blue and black its gorgeous. It does really well with fine nibs in cheap paper, no bleeding or looking fuzzy, its formal enough I can use it at work or hand in a paper in collage yet not your everyday boring blue and blacks. I really have nothing bad to say about this ink. Just a word of advise usually all Noodler's ink are filled to the very top sooo be extra careful when opening any of his bottle not to spill it. I attach some photo using mead ruled paper with my grandpas old Parker 45 that has an extra fine nib. I tend not to fin a lot of reviews using this kind of paper thats its more used here in schools.
0,A very comfortable mouse pad for my office desk.
0,i am so happy that they offer refills. I use these refills in my tri pen and they are great for everyday use. I bring one with me in my purse and a few in my backpack for school. there are no other erasable brand that satisfies me the way pilot does.
0,no compaint
0,good
0,Love these.  Bought one and then bought another.  Perfect for my small office.  Can lock if need be.  Sturdy and well built.  Can roll it wherever you wish them to be.
0,I've been using the Safari for about a month and a half now and I have been very pleased with it.  The pen is made of solid, durable plastic that feels good in the hand.  The grip is comfortable and allows one to hold the pen at a natural angle.  The size of the tip is ideal for me, although others have said it is too big for a fine.  It writes a little thicker than a standard ballpoint, which I prefer.  I like my writing to have a little weight to it.  I have been using the pen with the converter that so many others have recommended purchasing.  I will also make that recommendation.  I have not had any problems with leakage and only minor flow problems that did not persist after I refilled the converter.  On a final piece of information that may be valuable is that this pen is made in Germany and not China like so many other products.
0,can't wait to use
0,I couldn't quite put my finger on it ... but something about this card was terribly familiar. Then, it hit me. Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoniette! The aesthetic is similar to that film's classic-meets-punk/pop-culture vibe. The card is hip, tactile, and sweet. Moreover, the odd size makes it really stand out. I dig it!!
0,This is a great pen for the price. Looks great, and writes pretty well. Under five dollars it is unbeatable deal. I have used it for a few months, and I am happy with it. The only downside is that the gold-plating on the body will rub off if you keep it in you pocket, and it rubs against other pens. Still have gotten worse pens for ten times as much, so this is a good deal, and a perfectly serviceable pen.
0,This works very well on my colored pencils.
0,So cute and so handy!  Works great!
0,Rated it well as is a good product, but needed the super heavyweight; This is only as thick as maybe contact paper, not durable enough for what I needed.;
0,Tight seal and sure beats the price of disposable cartridges.
0,Excellent lead. The price was reasonable and the performance is superb. I would recommend this to anyone using 2mm lead holder.
0,I enjoy the little quotes in this pack of 365 stickers. They went nicely in my planner.
0,I just have a small comment for every single person that said the INK WAS TOO LIGHT.  The package VERY clearly says SOFT color.  That's not to be mixed up with light SHADES.  Lilac or Lavendar are a "milky" shade of purple.  If you take this not as bright color, Lilac, and you soften it, you will have a very subtle color.  It would be like looking through very sheer liner curtains.		I have used them in my adult coloring books as markers.  The very subtle colors are perfect for butterfly or fairy wings,, or wind blowing, or .......?		I hope you can see in my photo that I've used the blue, pink, and green highlighters.  (The blue flowers ruffly petals, the thin petals of the pink flower, and the background.)  My tablet doesn't take the best photos.		This picture is from the "Color With Music"-Botanical book.	 Thanx

0,These file folders are exactly what I expected.  Good quality material and will last as long as I need them to last.  Would buy them again and recommend to a friend.		How I review:	When I review a product said product automatically starts with four stars as I rarely will purchase anything below four stars.  I then add and/subtract stars based on certain criteria as listed below.	1. If an item is exactly what I expected and nothing more it will receive a four star rating	2. If an item surpasses my expectations it will gain a star	3. If an item goes slightly below my expectations it will lose a star	4. If the instructions for the product (if needed) are poorly written (hard to understand due to language issues or grammar) or just too hard to follow it will lose a star no matter if the product meets or exceed my expectations	5. If a product is significantly below my expectations I will deduct two stars	6. It will be rare that I would give a product one star since I buy mostly items that have a 4+ rating but in rare instances there may be a good reason that even a four star product gets a one star rating from me.  It could be because of customer service issues from the company but whatever the case is I will clearly explain my reason for giving a product only one star
0,Very good product.  I am totally satisfied with the product, the price and the prompt shipping.  Of course, I am a Prime member, as well.  The pictures come out beautiful and the paper is sturdy, not flimsy.  Very decent price.
0,Thinner than I expected.
0,This is probably the best and most sturdy chair mat I have ever had. I spend at least 8-10 hours a day, 7 days a week at my desk. I received this shipped in a flat box but still let it sit for a day or so before putting it down and beginning to use it, it was the middle of January so I wanted to be sure it was at full room temperature.		I've now been using this mat for 8 months and it is still holding up well, there are absolutely no cracks and the surface is not marred. I have read a few negative comments about the edges, either curling up or causing the chair to not roll properly back on if it rolled off, but I have not experienced either one, Being in my chair and at my desk for those long periods I do frequently get up and at other  times I do roll the chair off the mat but the chair always rolls back on to the mat from the carpet without any problem. There is also no curls to any of the edges after all this time. I have also had no movement in the mat, the spines on the bottom have held this in the same spot I put it down on 8 months ago.		I have absolutely no negative comments about this mat. It is durable, sturdy, well performing and my desk chair rolls on it with ease.
0,Love it , works  perfect.  Arrived on time  with  free  2 day shipping with Prime.
0,This Swingline punch is the easiest hole punch that I have ever used.  Right away, I grabbed 20 sheets of paper and tried it out.  With almost no effort, it punched neat, clean holes in every sheet!		Although there isn't an instruction sheet, the outside of the box identified the parts and the punch directions are written on the body.  Lock and unlock directions are clearly indicated at the base of the handle.		The punch comes with three cutters that can be moved to eight other holes, with measurements written by the holes.  Hopefully, you don't have to move the cutters often, because you have to unscrew them from the base to change the spacing.		The punch has a soft, plastic base that won't scratch a desktop.  There is a tray on the bottom to catch the punched holes.  It slides out for easy emptying.		The box states that the punch has a limited lifetime warranty  but provides no details.  The Swingline website adds that the punch has a 100% performance guarantee, but also has no specifics.  Guess if it breaks, you can ask Swingline to send you another, since there are no conditions on these claims.  Right?		For the price, this is a handy tool that appears to work well.
0,This little machine does what I expected it to do: that is talk in one of the 12 different native languages/phrases that are commonly used as a tourist.  Not looking for one that you can type in words/phrases free forms then translate to a native language.  Those would be much more expensive and perhaps weight more.  Also not sure how accurate the translation will be in ALL instance.  Since I already spoke fluently one of the 12 languages I listened to that language and found the pronunciation and translation very accurate.  So I assume the rest of 11 languages should have the same consistency.	I am basically using this very portable but seemed to be solidly built machine whenever I am driving or doing my walking/exercise to learn enough since I am embarking on foreign trips soon.  I know I am not going to be fluent for everyday conversation with any native speaker even if I mastered all the phrases in the machine.  But to me my purpose of knowing a few phrases is a courtesy to the countries I am visiting that I am making an effort to learn their language and from my experience in foreign travel the native people appreciate it.	So I recommend this little gadget for its price (under $40) and portability and sturdiness.
0,Useful item, no issues.
0,Definitely better than bare wood. However, I wish they offered darker colors.
0,My friend Ellen got me excited about scrapbooking when she invited me and some other members of the Gift Bearers Collectors Club over to her home for a project.  We made a scrapbook that illustrated our club activities at Amy's Hallmark in Chesapeake, Virginia.  Now I keep all of my scrapbooking notes and ideas inside a purple Wilson Jones 1" binder&nbsp;].  The Amazon Vine Program sent me a set of Wilson Jones Recycled Bliss Dividers.  I easily inserted them into the binder and use these to separate my paperwork.		  The dividers appear to be made of a durable hard cardboard with a coating that makes it slick like plastic.  The designs are gorgeous.  Once, when I was in Atlanta, I toured a mansion that was built in the 1920's.  The walls were decorated with paper that had designs very similar to those on my new binders.  That was a fun trip.  Each time I look at the dividers, I'm reminded of that house and the great time I had touring it.  The designs are nostalgic and remind me of muted, psychedelic pop art that is jazzy.		  The dividers can be used as scrapbooking paper.  When one is finished using these dividers, instead of throwing them away, they can be cut using various scrapbooking dies.  Beautiful designs can be created.  Believe me, I have seen numerous types of fabrics and materials (everything from lace doilies to panty hose) used in scrapbooking in order to give projects a special 3D effect.  Ellen's favorite scrapbooking saying is "Add this to make it go pop!"  These Wilson Jones Recycled Bliss Dividers will make any binder go pop!		Joseph B. Hoyos
0,These are staples, they go in a stapler. Just in case someone didn't know. Standard staples. The length barely fits into staplers so you have to break them if you aren't completely out.
0,I love the panasonic headsets. Unfortunately this does get very staticy sometimes. The main box is in the basement ( my office ) and the rest of the house it's not perfect but it's fine.
0,MY FAVORITE PEN FOR THE PAST 15+ YEARS!! Easily clip it onto the button flap of a golf-type shirt and no worries about it being so long that it pushes out to look like you have a deformed breast
0,I don't regret buying these. They are currently serving the purpose they are intended for. However... I've noticed the names are smudging a little. It isn't the worst thing that could happen because we can still read the names. But I'd prefer they didn't. Just for aesthetic purposes. You know, like when I'm folding sweet Mary's uniform shirt and I want to see her name neatly written on the inside. It's blurry. And I know it isn't my eyes because I need glasses for distance, not reading. They aren't horrible, but they could be better.		Pro tip - Definitely use a sharpie marker instead of a pen, or highlighter, or dry erase marker!
0,Love It !!!  Makes working/typing much easier
0,Great Product!
0,Works very well, solid and easy on the hands. Purchased as a replacement for a lead holder that went airborne and crash landed, that one's internal plastics didn't survive the terminal velocity.  I switched it out to good old #2B vs. the graphite inserts provided, they were harder than I liked.  There IS a sharpener in the "eraser" end.  However, I do not plan to "test" the flying dynamics of this one.
0,As good as Moleskine or any other "brand name".  Also priced perfectly for what is it, a kids [cardboard cover marbleized] for adults.  The only thing its missing is the Moleskine name and the high price.
0,Good quality OEM

0,Credit card blocking sleeves are pretty much an essential in today's world. With all the ways of stealing your information, these Mead sleeves are just one good method to help prevent this type of theft. Many banks and credit unions now offer these free of charge, so you can certainly try that route if you're not willing to spring for these.		Included in the package are 10 sleeves for credit cards, with an added bonus of two passport protectors. I use these for not only my credit cards, but my flex spending cards, which also have a magnetic strip on the back. The thin design doesn't add too much bulk to the wallet.		You can test the effectiveness of these on a wireless device that has an antenna. Other reviewers have done so and it proves that the sleeves work.		For peace of mind, especially when travelling, I recommend these.
0,work great. a little smaller than you may think by the photo but are great marking pins.
0,As advertised.
0,Love these, they were easy to affix to the wall.
0,Item came as described.
0,These things come through all the time and they run out a little earlier than they used to , but the value is there, so I just buy these cases and keep it going.
0,Now my blue space pen can write...BLUE!!! Perfect!
0,Now the printer willl work longer hours wthout shutting down as often. The ink cartridge is easy to install inside the printer.
0,Paper mate always makes some great pens. They write so smooth and perfectly. I love fine point pens because of the sharp tip of the pen and the delicate writing they make on the paper. These are great pens that will last a long while.
0,I bought these gel pens to write on black envelopes for my baby shower and they worked wonderfully! I also used them for white envelopes and the ink also showed up very well.		I DO recommend this product!
0,No detectable flex, and not overly slick so as to present a hazard. I just wish I had bought a larger one.		!!!Update(8/31/16): After observation and extensive use it has been determined that you guys are all really fat!!!!		5 stars
0,smooth and dense, perfect for our fuel log sheets
0,Hard to find in stores.  Worked exactly as anticipated.
0,The envelopes are great, and they came in 2 days.  All this at a great value.
0,This is Perfect for QuickBooks Invoices
0,Vibrant colors and long lasting.
0,I bought 2, one to stack on top of the other. The configuration provides a safe place for the warm cable box and a top shelf for the  small 19 inch TV.
0,works great
0,Best thing ever made	Use it on my whiteboard
0,I love the scotch tape brand and I had misplaced my dispenser a few years ago. I saw this package on sale and I had to get it. I keep loosing my individual ones but having the dispenser because I can always find it.  This package will last me long time but it is well worth the price I paid. The dispenser is weighted so it doesn't slide around while I'm using it.it stays in one please. It makes it so much easier if your wrapping a package or something like that, I can get the piece I need with just one hand.
0,I was skeptical of the quality of the chair because of the prices of the others that are like it. Upon putting the chair together, I love this chair. I have a bad back and i have yet to complain about it when sitting in this chair. I cannot say that about many others that i have had in the past.
0,Great value
0,Very good product at a great price.
0,This is the best paper you can buy for a Canon inkjet printer.  Your prints will look better and last much longer.
0,First and foremost it arrived on time and the assembly was easy, looks quite solid and better quality then anticipated so I am pleased with this purchase. Now as far the long term use that remains to be determined. I will write a follow up review in a  few months.
0,exactly what I needed
0,I do a lot of craft work, so I go through boxes of these.
0,I love them.. All of them awesome..
0,Good markers.

0,GOOD PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING, THANK YOU
0,Good product.
0,Great Product and prices and great service
0,I like that this cutter is a little weightier than other similar priced cutters.  It has a metal base and feels sturdy without paying over $100.  The arm locks securely in place and would be hard for a child to figure out.  I like the added automatic paper clamp.
0,Good
0,solid product
0,This is a wonderful organizer and seems well made. It's helping keep my messenger bag in good order.
0,Holds my stamp sheets perfectly. Stores great
0,Bought this in 2011 and it still functions without chips. My wife uses it daily under her office rolling chair. Very, very nice.
0,Easy set-up, most of it was pre-programmed. I got this for my 80 year old father, who finds it easy to use.
0,Work great, perfect size!
0,Doesn't work in the  Brother printer
0,Arrived quickly and what a good price.  I thought about getting cheaper off brand inks but people reported so many problems with off brands - like terrible print quality so I just went with HP ink.  Better off in the long run I think.  It's cheaper if you buy the combo pack too.
0,Great product
0,Good value... very strong!
0,Perfect Quality for my shipping purposes! A+++Seller!
0,The hardest task is data management after files are transferred to computer.  The scanning process is easy.
0,color smoothly ... love the metallic and glitter pens for sure.
0,great pens
0,This holds most of my rulers except for a really wide one I have.  I have this sitting up on a shelf and it's very stable.  I love having a place to keep my rulers organized!
0,I need to start out by talking about their AMAZING customer service.... okay so get this... I've been using v4ink cartridges for years now for my Samsung ML-2010 laser printer ... I popped a laser printer in that I'd had in my closet for over two years (didn't know that the v4ink toner cartridge I had in my printer would last so long - a very pleasant surprise - so that's why the "new" toner cartridge was over 2 years old)... the toner cartridge is making great print-outs as it normally does but ... it makes a squeaking sound when it prints ... no big deal, I can ignore the squeaking but I got worried and sent v4ink an email asking about it... v4ink immediately replied and issued me a FULL REFUND on the toner cartridge through amazon even though I purchased it 2 years ago and they didn't even ask me to send back the cartridge !  I should point out too that this must be some sort of anomaly, I've been using v4ink cartridges for years now with no problems... so, props to v4ink  :) .. seriously, if you have problems of any sort reach out to them on their website (google v4ink to find it  :)  ) and they'll take care of you :)  ... cannot get over just how nice these guys were to me, TWO FULL YEARS and they still gave me a refund !  :)  ...
0,So far so good (couple of months) even with bigger stacks
0,I bought this as a gift for a teenage girl who is an artist that like to draw anime.  She likes it a lot.
0,Using this to make a Teacher Binder. Feels very sturdy and it's the perfect size.
0,I swapped out the casters that came with my new office chair from Costco. These are much quieter on laminate flooring, and they tend to grip better. I was constantly pulling myself forward with the old casters. These help prevent the chair moving back while typing..
0,Its beautiful! And not too small. Im praying it will last a good while, its the sweat that usually gets to these mouse pads
0,Nive sharpies.
0,Used in Canon Copier. Works great! Much less than the Cartridge Chain Ink refiller.
0,Decided to try these to protect credit cards from skimmers. Sleeves are sturdy and cards fit snug so they still fit in wallet slots. Will be ordering more for other family members.
0,This has got to be the best ink I have ever purchased for my Epson 2540 Workforce Printer. It produces crisp clear prints with color that is just beautiful. It is vibrant when needed and pale and vintage when the digital calls for that. I love it and this will be my go to ink from now on. I have used this ink for quite some time before giving a review and have purchased twice from this company. The ink has held true to what I wrote above in both orders and still is producing beautiful prints of all my digital paper. Go for this ink if it will work in your printer as I have tried many and this one is truly TOP OF THE LINE in re-manufactured ink cartridges. LOVE IT AND WILL NOW ALWAYS BUY FROM THIS COMPANY! Thanks at EZ ink for great printer ink!!! Will be making a third purchase soon!
0,These were high quality dividers. There are so many cheap versions out there that won't last a full school year. I especially liked these because they have a pocket for more organization.
0,I love it!
0,Very nice and stylish
0,great item for half the price of similar items. Save your money and get this one, it does the same and has all the same features for 1/2 the price.
0,These are great to hold my coloring pencils.  It makes it very easy to keep the pencils in order and easy to find.
0,Best gel pens there are!  These are a smooth metallic and look great when you want something in your picture to have a little shine to them.  Sakura makes the BEST gel pens.
0,These are my favorite pens to have in my purse or reading, love the fact that I have a pen and highlighter in one, along with the tabs.  This is my second set.
0,To me, these are hands down the best pens I've ever used. I'd rather buy 50 of these packs than one Montblanc (which I have -received as a gift- and hasn't left the drawer since I tested it).		They just feel comfortable and glide on the paper.		The only bad thing about them is that I never seem to be able to use them all up because people like them so much that they steal them from me!		I've bought dozens and will continue to buy them.
0,I have to remember to measure using the bottom of this tool. The inch marks are on the dark gray top and then at the bottom. When cutting small card pieces of 2x1 or similar it is hard to make sure you are plumb because the inch markings are so far apart with metric measures in the top portion of the info bed. CUTS GREAT
0,good value.
0,Works great
0,Good for the price.
0,Great Product, we have been purchasing over 5 years for our clients. Thank You LD!!!!!
0,I was looking basically for a double-sided sticker/tape - a solid. This is not it. This is goo on a roll. I create flat-back rhinestone stickers. I stick the stones on one side, then peel and stick the created design onto another object. Not possible with this, it falls apart. Just FYI.
0,good product
0,Works just fine!
0,I liked these labels, and they were in fact repositionable.  Just keep in mind that they can be repositioned once or twice and don't stick well after that.  I think that is good for this product.  Just wanting others to know the extent of repositionability.		They also printed nice on the computer.  I would recommend this product.
0,These are wonderful exactly what I needed
0,This is one of the products thats really hard to review,I have used this for a very short time,haven't had a blocked call get through yet,I will	upgrade to five stars if this stays true,You can't prove a negative. So far (fingers crossed) this will continue--upgrade later	For the manufacturer  (political season is already here) can I daisy chain these units(1200 might not be enough)
0,Buy these every year
0,I like Majestic tabs.
0,Using these to save my favorite recipes!
0,Worked as good as original cartridges! I would definitely buy again!

0,Pilot G-2 pens are my go to favorites for writing, so I wasn't surprised that they would be good for coloring. These metallic inks are the best. They go on the page smoothly and the inks are sophisticated in their appearance. Worth every penny. The white ink isn't particularly opaque.
0,Inexpensive binders. Worth the money.. Claps very good, opens and closes easily. Actually very nice binder for the price.
0,Nice pens.
0,This is great. $35 for 1 year. Can't beat that. It took about 5 days to transfer my phone number, but thats not so bad. The bad part is that it cost $19 to transfer the number. Oh well.
0,Great for portable use.
0,They work well
0,as advertised, cost to much
0,The Inkjet cartridge arrived quickly, in good shape and is working just fine in my printer.  Can't beat the price!!
0,This is a cute donut pin holder.  It is made out of firm rubber with pink on the top to look like frosting.  The pins have colored ends to look like sprinkles and are about 1/2 long.  You can add longer pins or needles if you want to.  This pin holder can be used for push pins for an office or for sewing.  It also makes a great gift.
0,This is a good safe to keep items in.  Not Fireproof, Must secure to a wall.. But still a good inexpensive safe.
0,Perfect calculator for on my desk.  Like it very much
0,My wrists used to hurt before I got this pad and after a week of using it my wrist doesn't hurt as much.
0,Great quality paper that I used to be able to get locally in our office supply store, but they no longer stock it. This has little bits of sparkle that add an extra dimension to cards and flyers.
0,my pen
0,Very nice calendar.tks!
0,I like using these Christmas cards when I am writing to someone outside of Florida.  It's a nice diversion from the average Christmas card featuring a winter scene.
0,Pens arrived in a timely manner! Luv the variety of colors!
0,as expected
0,I have never been more satisfied with a phone as I have with this one.  I would highly recommend this phone.
0,Excellent price and fast service.
0,Very pleased
0,Good stuff.
0,We use whiteboards for notices, budgeting, scheduling and just plain old notes. These markers work well with the boards and are low cost.
0,If you have an optical mouse that doesn't track properly [ jumps around the screen ] this mouse pad is for you. The simple version is it just works. My wireless Logitech 1100 mouse had trouble tracking on black and even gray mouse pads this pad fixed that problem because it's designed specifically for optical mice. It also has a nice high tech look to it. The adhesive keeps it in position but it is easily moved. I also bought the 3M wrist rest to go with it. The mouse pad and separate wrist rest work very well together.
0,Nice & sharp and takes your pencil to a nice point. I'm glad I bought these
0,Thank you very much. Great product.
0,I write in bed in a laying down position on my back. With gravity the enemy of ink flow after about 8 seconds, I was writing my notes pretty fast and sometimes couldn't figure out what I had written when looking at it later. Not so with these pens. I can now write whole songs and poems (nice relaxing hobby) and do it at a speed where the final product is legible. I prefer a bold line from my pens but I can handle the finer line these pens leave because I am just grateful to have a pen that works upside down. Will always buy these.
0,For the 5x7 size this paper works great.  Typically I use the platinum paper for all my printing, but for the small sizes I use Photo Paper Plus and can't really tell the difference.
0,shipped fast, great printer
0,This size is perfect for so many things. The bags are extra strong and can withstand a lot of postal abuse.
0,Just want I needed
0,Great envelopes
0,it is ok
0,I have tried compatible (or so they are called) brands have had issues with all of the other compatible brands, yes the price is higher for genuine brother products but in the long wrong you will save your self some grief, I spent over 30 minutes one time with support reviewing EVERY SINGLE S/N OF EVERY CONSUMER REPLACEABLE PART only after she confirmed that all were the real deal did she proceed to try and help me.  What the inferred lesson was that if she had found even 1 non brother S/N on and of the consumables  likely she would have not helped me at all
0,its paper
0,I love these markers. I have a lot of different brands of markers from really expensive to really cheap, but in terms of handling and quality of the end result, these are my favourite. They are moderately priced, not cheap, not too expensive, but the value is totally worth it. The one thing I hate the most about markers is the streaks, how no matter how much you saturate an area on paper, it still leaves streaks. Not so with these markers. They blend on the paper really well, and the result is very professional-looking and perfectly blended. The markers are thick, with a large and thick TRUE brush tip. This means that the tip is flexible like the tip of an actual brush, and you can draw thick or thin lines depending on how much you bend the tip, and at what angle you hold it. The ink is alcohol-based (propanol, butanol, and diacetone alcohols) and has a strong smell (the typical Sharpie permanent marker smell), but it goes on so smoothly with hardly any pressure and so evenly blended that the smell becomes just a minor inconvenience. Keep in mind that because they are alcohol-based they bleed a lot, so don't use them in colouring books with back to back designs or you'll ruin the design on the back, and the one on the following page. I recommend placing a plain white cardstock page under the design you are working on, or between your page and the table you're working on.  They are a joy to work with, the brush is exquisite, you feel like you are actually painting. You can cover large areas because the brush tip itself is big, but it also works well with smaller, more intricate designs because the very tip of the brush tip is thin, sharp, and easy to control.  I wish Sharpie made larger sets with more colours, like their Ultra Fine Tip or Fine Tip markers that come in sets of 24 pens.
0,I purchased a Swingline Heavy Duty Stapler, 160 Sheets, Black/Gray (S7039005) stapler back about a year ago and use it once or twice a month at work.		Look and feel:	Just looking at the pictures, you can see that the Swingline is more utilitarian in looks--the Rapesco has a more "trendy" sort of look and even allows you to remove the back piece of plastic so you can write your name, or put a picture or something inside to personalize it.  Whether that's worth anything or not is a matter of opinion.  The Swingline's handle feels smaller in your hand compared to the Rapesco.  I could see some people preferring the handle one way and other people preferring it the other, so again--matter of opinion.  I will point out, though, that if you are frequently stapling very thick wads of paper, the greater surface area on the Rapesco COULD be a plus.  On the other hand, while both take up about the same footprint, the Rapesco feels a bit bulkier which makes the Swingline give a general impression of taking up less space.  I think this is a result of the fact that the Swingline is mostly metal whereas the Rapesco has a lot of plastic.  Again--opinion, but that could be a win for you.		If you look at the picture, you'll see on the front of the Rapesco is a purple plastic... thing.  This is meant to help hold your paper flat while you staple it.  I suppose it could come in handy with large pieces of paper, but for 8.5 x 11, I really don't think it's necessary and the end result is that it just adds a bit of bulk to the stapler.  HOWEVER, it is easily removable and splits into 2 pieces, so it isn't hard to store in a desk drawer or whatever.  Swingline does not give you such an option, so I count this a (minor) plus.		Winner --> ?  depends on your opinions		Capacity:	The Swingline claims the ability to punch through 160 sheets of paper.  I've never had a need to approach that limit, so I can't say how well it does it, but the Rapesco "only" claims 115 sheets		Winner --> Swingline		Performance:	I've had the opportunity to staple more with the Swingline than with the Rapesco, but so far, I have had no bad staples with the Rapesco--all have done exactly what they were supposed to do.  The Swingline doesn't bend staples often, but I have had it happen.  As stated, though--this isn't really fair since the Swingline USUALLY does just fine and it could just be a matter of time before the Rapesco does the same thing, so maybe we should leave this one out...	Both are easy to punch through large wads of paper due to the large amount of leverage they provide, but if I had to pick one, I might go with the Rapesco as being ever so slightly easier.  Also, as noted above, I think the Rapesco's wider surface area may make it a slightly more comfortable experience for frequent stapling of extra thick wads.  It's hard to say. I'm going to call this one a draw		Winner --> Draw		Price:	At the time of this review, the price of the Rapesco is only $1.64 less than the Swingline, so I'm inclined to call it a draw, although I suppose that *technically*, the Rapesco is SLIGHTLY cheaper		Winner --> Rapesco, but only by about 6%		Loading staples:	Here's where the Rapesco has a clear win over the Swingline.  Not that the Swingline is hard to load, per se, but the Rapesco is a piece of cake.  With a simple press of a button, the tray pops out and you can then just drop the staples in and close the door again. Ta da!  The Swingline requires you to press a button down, slide the holder out, slide some staples in and then push the holder back in and up.  Like I said-not hard, but it took me a minute to figure it out the first time and any way you cut it, the Rapesco is easier.		Winner --> Rapesco		So there you have it--2 very well matched staplers.  I think you would be perfectly happy with either model and I would recommend either one to anyone.  Which *YOU* should choose will depend on your opinions, but me, personally, if *I* had to have just one or the other, I think I'd go with the Rapesco.		OTHER NOTES:	I got a box of the "923" size staples which are meant for 40-70 sheets of paper.  You CAN do less, if you want (I tried 7) but if you do, the staples folds back in and pops back out the front of the paper, which looks unprofessional.  You couldn't do more, though--I stapled through 70 sheets of paper a few times (and it was very easy, by the way) and the staples DID make it all the way through and ARE holding together, but only just barely--if I tried to add any more sheets, I really don't think the staples legs would be long enough to make it through and still have room to bend enough to actually hold them.  On both the Swingline and the Rapesco, you can zoom in on the picture (of the staplers themselves) and clearly see the various staple sizes and capacities they are rated for.		RECOMMENDED
0,This mechanical pencil is one of the best in the market.  The pull-back-spring needs a damper (or smoother/softer spring) to make this item ideal.
0,nice ink, good flow, rich color
0,I am a watercolorist, and I use these pens in my art pieces.  They also are great for marking fabrics and some other surfaces.  The fine point pens are amazingly smooth and make very precise lines.
0,This is a must have. Has 3 different size sharpeners built into one. I love how the shaving department doesnt come loose.
0,These are loud phones, great for communication with the hearing impaired. In our field anyways. Great caller Id and easy to install.
0,Great!
0,Awesome product and price
0,Texasman is obsessed with his gas mileage in his muscle cars (he's having a second teenage-hood!) and everything we were out and got gas, he wanted my calculator to check the MPH.		Tiring of this, I bought 4 calculators for him to keep in each car, and he leaves mine alone. This works great.
0,This calculator is faster and more elegant than the other calculators that I have owned. It is pretty slim too. I recommend this.
0,There's not much to say about spiral notebooks.  The paper is sturdy and thick enough to not bleed through. The pages tear out easily. The cover is sturdy.
0,Very nice!
0,very good to have around
0,I'm in love with this! I travel from school to school and keep my most time sensitive documents in here.
0,This is a good safe for the money - easy to use and it is a decent size for home use.  You would definitely need to use the mounting bolts for additional security; otherwise, it is possible for a thief to pick it up and walk off with it.  Several reviewers did complain about the label on the front not coming off easily; they are correct.  It's not a big deal, just a nuisance; one reviewer recommended using a hair dryer - that works well, along with some Goo Gone.	I have no complaints about this safe and would recommend it to anyone looking to protect valuables.  If it were also fireproof, that would add the 5th star.
0,love them - they sharpen well
0,LOVE IT
0,inexpensive--but nice--fountain pen.
0,Best disposable pen you can buy in my opinion. Love the bold tip as well, writes very smoothly.
0,Same great quality from back in the day. When I think "mechanical pencil" this is what pops into my head first. I grew up on these things. Did away with those top-click boring gray ones that grandma and grandpa used to keep in the old Yahtzee box since the 1940's.		You can't go wrong with this style. It's time to wake up and start living.

0,My second one and my go to scanner. Feeds lots of papers and user friendly control center software. Very durable
0,Great ink. Fast shipping. WIN!!
0,I love stretching these rubber bands. And when I gave some to my niece, she bundled them tightly into a ball. . .  They bounced very nicely.		Oh. And P.S. . . They are great for bundling files and other stuff.
0,Nice pens, use them for my coloring books, I would recommend these.
0,These pens write nicely.  I got this box for my husband but he complains they are too skinny for him.  He doesn't like them very well.  I myself prefer the Paper Mate Liquid Flair x-fine but he doesn't like them either.  Fortunately, I don't mind using  either type.  Oh, well, what else can I say about pens?  I like both of them.
0,Been using this format for years...perfect for me
0,I bought these for a business were we go through pens like water.  I didn't want to spend a fortune on pens and when I found these several years back, I continue to order them.  For the price they are a decent pen, one that doesn't break the bank to purchase.
0,OK, the printer is here.
0,Love them
0,Smooth and handles well on red lines and not over bright
0,Have used this paper for a long time.  Good prints always.
0,GOOD
0,Nice labels work well chop works well as expected good deal for the
0,First I just have to say that Laser printers are so much nicer than ink jet printers in quality and speed.		This Brother DCP-L5600DN laser printer is no exception. It is a BEAST: It stands 18" tell, and it is 14" wide and 15" deep at the base. It is quick, efficient and, moreover (with one proviso noted below) easy to setup.		It comes with a CD Rom with Utilities and Drivers or you can download them if your computer doesn't have a disk drive. There is a fairly useful User's Guide that also comes, printed out, with the printer, which I highly recommend users read before trying to figure out how to do any of the more complicated functions of the printer like faxing or scanning.		One proviso: Just installing the software isn't as intuitive as I thought. I had to hunt around for the right piece of software to do the scanning, but the User's Guide actually explains that it is the ControlCenter4 software that runs all those features. Once that was figured out, everything else was very intuitive and straight forward.		I love the fact that the document feeder holds such a large capacity and that the glass is legal size and not just letter size, so you can scan and print larger documents if you need to (just use the extended paper tray to feed in the legal size paper instead of the drawer.)		I do wish it had wifi capability - it has to be hooked up to an Ethernet cable - but that literally is the only thing that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Otherwise it works really great. It's even sleek and lovely to look at. It isn't as large as the box it comes in makes it seem, which is good because it fits on our existing printer stand without any trouble. It's not overly heavy either, even though once again the box it comes in is mighty hefty.		I would completely recommend this black and white laser printer to friends who have in-home offices, small offices or workgroups that need printers that are fast and low maintenance. The toner cartridges aren't even that more expensive than buying a full set of black and color cartridges for an ink jet and the laser toner cartridges last longer (around 3,000 pages).		Update: After moving and having the printer in storage for 7 weeks, the re-setup was quick, simple and easy. It requires a network cable but I plugged it into a WiFi Range Extender so it hooked up to my wireless network. It took only moments for the computers to recognize the printer and the printer to recognize the network. Everything prints as expected even from stand-by mode. This printer is fast and efficient. Just keep in mind it is only Black & White.
0,I love that I don't have to hurt my wrist to use this. The only thing I don't care for on any of these models is that they can pinch your hand when you release it. Nothing crazy. I know it isn't rated for it, but it does more than 15 pages for me.
0,Good deal to refill the factory starter cartridge	and make it an extended use item. Took 4-5 mins	to convert and works great!
0,Exceeded my expectation...
0,This paper is only 22 lbs but feels heavier. Use this paper primarily in our HP laserprinter. It has performed well.	.
0,Great quality and great price.
0,Nice desk but I wish it was larger.  My error in judgment
0,very satisfied
0,Such a beautiful colour, it's classy rather than bright, a vintage red, I love it so much
0,I lost one just like this. So I went shopping.  In the office supply store, the trend is for all the staplers to be unnecessarily wide.  So I bought this one again.  Its nice and small. I keep it in my top desk drawer laying on it's side.		It's not wimpy.  Will staple a bunch of papers.  Body is 4.5" long, plastic part is 1" wide max.		If I loose it again, I will buy another just like this.
0,Great quality, best bang for the buck I could find.  I'm using them to send out customer birthday cards along with product samples.  Perfect for my purposes!  Would also love to use personally.
0,This shredder works great.  The only problem is that it doesn't quite handle the number of sheets as advertised.  Ten to twelve sheets are no problem which takes care of 95% of our work.  It works great with credit cards and dvd's as well.  If budget had permitted, we would have gone with a more powerful shredder, but we would definitely purchase this one again.
0,just fine.
0,Nice phone for the money. Just needed a cheap one for the garage, and this fits the bill. Might put a longer cordset on it tho.
0,We use this all the time for shipping items.  It is a good size and seems to have good performance.
0,Have had this a couple of months. Enjoying it in my kitchen.
0,Holds papers and looks good.
0,Love it. I always buy these calendars. They fit my calendar frame and are the prettiest pictures with plenty of room to enter the daily apps, etc
0,I print my own planner stickers and was looking for some transparent options for some designs - these did the trick. Purchase through amazon was much cheaper than buying in the store so saved some money there.  These worked perfectly for what I needed them for.		All opinions expressed in this review are honest and my own.
0,I use a clear flexible plastic desk cover on top of an antique wooden desk.  The desk cover is great, except that it's buckled quite a bit where I use my laser mouse, and the mouse won't track over the buckled plastic.		This mouse pad is a great solution.  It's very thin, it adheres to the plastic, and although I can still feel the "buckle" in the plastic under the mouse pad, it tracks perfectly now.		It's a very low-friction surface, so the mouse tracks quickly -- I had to adjust the mouse speed down.		I wouldn't recommend this as a portable mouse pad -- the adhesive will collect dust and stuff when it's moved around, and will become ineffective pretty quickly, I'm guessing.		Overall, a very good product.
0,great product
0,Works great for our needs!
0,Love these. Arrived on time. Perfect for card crafting.
0,I bought this for work and it's been great. Very adjustable and love that I can rock my feet back and forth.
0,For a short person, this foot rest is perfect.
0,Every now and again I get a cheap store brand of tape and I regret it.  I always go back to scotch.  Nothing sticks better or is as sturdy.  And when using over the labels it leaves the label readable...cheap store/generic brands are fuzzy and hard to read thru.  One name brand I will never leave.
0,Exactly what I was looking for!
0,hello,	  these note pads are an excellent purchase.  there are 60 sheets, far more than the ones at the local stores, if you can find them...they obviously last longer and look very cool.  there are so many varieties that the choices are almost endless.  great for anu lists, planning events, everyday notes for the old school people out there...things you do not want to put on your ipad or galaxy note pads...plus, carrying those electronic devices in stores is a little overboard... a great product and delivery...
0,For an inexpensive pen this one sure looks, feels and performs like one costing a lot more.  If you enjoy a good pen then this line, the Uni Jetstream, is for you.  I like them so much that I have the orange, silver, gun metal grey and a blue.  One to fit any mood.
0,I was a little leery of switching out my manufacturer-supplied casters, but they were too low and as a result, the center cylinder of the Aeron chair was damaging my brand new extra-thick carpet. I considered getting a plastic mat, but then heard about these, and now I am delighted. They were super easy to put onto the char, raised the height but nearly 2", and now I am in heaven. No more damage to the expensive carpet, I sit higher at my desk, AND, they roll like butter. I am very pleased.
0,I am a professional graphic designer, and photographer, and I love this paper. I use it exclusively for when I need an archival, or gallery, quality print. It has performed consistently flawlessly as long as I use the correct profile in one of my printers. It is intended specifically for a select few of the professional HP printers, however I have had no trouble at all (via custom profiles) using it in my Canon printers as well. It should be noted that it also takes well to both pigment, and dye, based inkjet inks.
0,This is a great binder, especially for the price. You can tell that it is very strong and will hold quite a bit.
0,Marimon sells these for a lot more . . . I now have a new provider! and with the Prime Shipping I get a great product cheaper and faster . . . which leads to more productivity and a huge annual savings!
0,I had an older shredder that just did strips. It had a propensity to plug up, and putting it in reverse often did not solve the problem, so had to unplug it and try to clean out the jammed little pieces of paper. With tweezers, needle-nosed pliers and a lot of patience, I could usually get all the paper out, but it was a chore. It finally just quit working after a couple of years.		Also, it only took one sheet at a time, did not have an auto setting, and was extremely noisy.		This Royal shredder is a vast improvement. It is far less noisy, and the auto setting makes it extremely easy. I limit the number of sheets to eight, and it eats them up easily with no jams. I have tried envelopes and 4x6 cards, and they all are taken quickly.		As one other reviewer wrote, the removable basket is a bit flimsy, but it will fit in OK if I push it gently. Also, wish it were a bit larger, but all in all, I am very pleased with this unit.		Now I'm glad the old one quit working. :)		3/19/2018 Update::  Wow, after more than seven years, this shredder is still working perfectly.. I give it daily home use and never have had a problem.		I shred documents, old bills, envelopes etc. daily and even credit cards now and then. It eats everything without complaint.		I do use the reverse after each use to clear the mechanism, and empty it before it is full.		A great machine and well worth the price
0,They do exactly what binder clips are designed to do.
0,just as good as avery, only a lot less expensive.
0,I was very surprised when I saw the cabinet	I thought it would be metal, but I am very happy with this cabinet, it's light & easy to move around
0,As expected
0,This was a birthday present from my husband, to go along with my Wand Scanner (which I love), and I have to say: this is the Best Thing Ever. The pages auto-feed, so there's almost no chance of error. It's quicker than a flatbed scanner, and more flexible (since I can remove the wand), and WAY more compact. I can feed anything through, from 8.5x11 sheets of paper to skinny little receipts. Two words: Get This.
0,Excellent product!  Great price!
0,Great paper cutter.  Had to get this to do a lot of cutting for my son's 3rd grade science fair project.  This cut them cleanly every time.  No issues I can forsee to come in the future.  Used this to cut a lot of thicker colored paper.
0,Smooth writing, no bleeding of the ink, quick drying, and great for use in a bullet journal. I prefer a clickable pen over a cap, because you can't lose the top, which happens often for me. The grip on the bottom of the pen is surprisingly effective, I used this to color in an adult color book and after an hour, I could tell that my fingers were appreciative of the extra padding.
0,Love, love, love this mouse pad.  Finally found one I like.  It's thin, doesn't slip around, doesn't attract dirt or get dirty easy and the large is a perfect size.  Buy it.
0,These are excellent! The pen is easy to refill (just untwist and pop the refill in). I really like it's more environmentally friend than having to throw out a whole plastic pen. I gave it 4 stars because the ink goes quickly! (I am also a teacher, though, and I write a lot.)
0,Just as advertised. Original ink with a good expiration date.
0,I love these, I have so many thumb drives that its its easy to mistake one for the other and some have barely any room for labels so i color coded them with these. Not to mention the colors are vibrant and the cloth has a sheen so your eyes spot whatever they are attached to fairly quickly in case you are rummaging through your bag.
0,Washable glue sticks for back to school supplies for shelter kids.
0,In the arena of bold and cheap ballpoint pens, this is a very good purchase.		I am a big fan of large diameter ballpoint pens (when they work). Many bold ballpoint pens clump with ink and become very messy. The Paper Mate Profile seems to have kept this in check. The ink goes on the page and that is where it stays.		This pen may not be a great choice for cursive, but block letter writers should find this pen a joy.
0,Good.
0,I bought these to make glossy planner stickers, but they're a little thin IMO. I've used them with both laser & inkjet printers and was always happy with the prints. I use HP Envy 4500 and HP Laserjet 200 printers. I use the "glossy photo paper" setting for both printers.		I gave it four stars because the sticker paper is not a bright white, it's more bone white. Because I use these for planner stickers w white outlines on the stickers, the color difference is noticeable.
0,Bought it for our many computer site passwords.  Funny buying an address book for this reason.  Couldn't find a "password book."		The alpha indexes work fine for this purpose.
0,This basket was exactly as advertised.  Very pleased and would recommend to anyone that needs a shopping cart
0,WORKS GREAT	EASY TO SET UP
0,It is just brand name for my printer.  I find that it works the best and finished color prints seem better.
0,works well for confrence table
0,fast shipping works great thanks
0,Just what I needed as a working file on my desk. Much easier to manipulate file folders than the standard square holders.
0,We buy these to scan mostly old photos.. honestly you really don't have that many or you do, but once you scan into a computer your done with this, so the idea is to scan the photos as quick and as good as possible.. and what your doing is archiving the photos, because honestly who wants to see your wedding photos anymore, that happened 20 years ago, maybe one or two of the folks there would love to see themselves in your old photos,, the kids, maybe when they get older they may take a look.. but honestly since today the technology is digital so photos are no big deal anymore and you will never need to scan them in the future.. so ok this product is a good price,, it scans good, not great but that also has to do with the quality of your old photos.. sometimes it sticks you have to turn it off and start again..the reason this happens,, you shoved another photo into it before it finished registering the previous one.. I don't like that the scanner puts steaks in the photos, not all but sometimes a lot of photos I had to redo, also if you put the photo in one way try putting it in sideways.. some photos will not go through without the photo holder that comes with the scanner... all in all.. its was a good deal..
0,Great product for a great price
0,Great tool for teaching the little ones how to write and count! There are small dry erase boards with capital letters, lower case letters, numbers, shapes, some basic arithmetic and a mostly blank board for free styling. The boards wipe easily with an eraser or any cloth or paper towel. I am a fan of these activity boards because it will allow the kids to keep practicing without you having to constantly buy new worksheets.		This set comes with 1 small black marker and that's my one (very small) con - I wish it came with at least a few colors and an eraser of some sort. Otherwise, it's a great tool to get the kids reading and counting!
0,Really sticky and great sound isolators for my speakers
0,as described
0,I have tried the inexpensive paper and the results reflected in the quality of the output.  We  have a dedicated photo printer of extremely high print quality and cheap paper does not do justice.  Want good results, buy good paper and ink.
0,Item seems to be as described but I won't be using them for a few months so cannot respond on quality yet.
0,Works great and I've organized my office like crazy ever since I got this. You must order and it. Awesome.
0,Very good purchased 2 of these and couldn't get them to feed in my dymo lable manager 160 so exchanged them after reading more reviews I found out that to get these to work you have to pull the label through a bit to loosen up the real I wasted about 2-3 inches before it started to work, considering how much more you get for your money I don't mind wasting 3 inches
0,Great
0,Nice item and works as expected.
0,Very good quality, great format and features.  Just the right size.
0,Clock works great. Easy to use. I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to buy a replacement clock, because the first one I purchased only lasted about 3 years.
0,Does what you expect and mouse works well.
0,Hi there.		All right, if you have ever used any of the Sharpie products you will know that they make high quality products.  These brush tip pens are no different.  They have exactly the same ink formula as the Sharpie fine and ultra-fine tipped markers.  So, that makes having the same colors in a brush tip even better.  This tip is soft and will bend according to the amount of pressure you put on it.  It can make nice thin likes and larger thick lines in the same stroke.  This is an excellent marker for anyone who likes to do lettering or calligraphy.		I have included a few photos, so that you can see a bit more about the brush tip marker.  The first photo is a page that I colored using only the Sharpie Brush Tip markers.  The 2nd photo simply shows them in a little container.  The 3rd photo is showing you the size of the brush tip marker in comparison to other markers.  I've included a couple of ultra-fine markers at the bottom, 3 brush tip markers, and also 1 Prismacolor Premiere double tipped marker.  This was merely for a physical size comparison.  The last photo shows the actual tip sizes of the brush tip, ultra-fine, fine, and the Prismacolor markers.		I hope the information I've provided to you here in my review has given you a clear picture of the Sharpie Brush Tip Markers 12-piece set.		Let me know if you have found my review helpful in your decision to purchase the Sharpie Brush Tip Markers 12-piece set.	Thanx,  Mindy
0,So far, we love the phone. Easy to use and set up. Display is easy to read
0,This item was expired but work just like they were brand new.  I will buy this again. And recommend this to my friends
0,Great quality! Sharp colors, softly and easily colors on the paper. Huge variety of colors, and 2 each of black and white. Includes gold and silver too! Great buy!
0,Bought this to go with dry erase board.  They do wear out in time so it is a good idea to have several on hand.
0,Purchased this unit after having already bought the Safco 9424MO (36 slots, no drawers).  This makes a great companion unit, fastening under the 36 slot unit.  Took about 45 minutes to put together.		The Safco models are superior to the Fellowes models, which use cardboard for dividers.  We're using them as mail slots for church leaders and fellowships.
0,Great item, should have been packed with my Sailor Fountain pen, but was not.  Luckily, got it in a couple days, and am now happily sketching!
0,I CAN NOT KEEP THESE PENS, AS EVERYONE LOVES	WRITING WITH THEM AND TEND TO KEEP THEM.	MAKES MY SNAIL MAIL EASIER TO DO...
0,What you see is what I wanted. I wanted these in staples and couldn't find. only the clicker version. so I found here for cheaper and they work fine.
0,Very sturdy business card holder. The only thing I don't like is that it's a very wide, so the cards can look sloppy after a few people take one so you're constantly straightening it. With my horizontal holders the fit is perfect for a card. I think if they made it more uniform I would gladly have given a 5.
0,great
0,Wow it's smooth! The nib is smaller than I thought though. The body of the pen is long enough for holding and writing with it unposted. And that's me talking, having large hands and holding my pens up high. Still no problem with this one. Mind you, if you're buying this pen from a Japanese reseller on Amazon, your pen will NOT come with a converter. So buy a Con-70 converter -- this is the largest converter Pilot makes and it fits this pen perfectly.		The writing is smooth. I got the SM nib and the Soft part is evident -- with slightest pressure you can get GREAT line variation.		Medium point in this pen is real European medium, NOT Japanese medium. So keep that in mind.
0,Great seal at edges and body of material.
0,I think this is a must for Harry Potter fans with limited space and unwilling to spend the bucks for the larger wands.  We purchased this one for my son for Christmas then I had to have one because I couldn't play with his.  The idea that I can have it on my desk and cast a quick spell before signing a check is just extra fun.  The one thing that is not necessarily clear is that the pen is actually inside the base of the wand (much like a pen cap), so it is really only 2 items, but still it is good fun.
0,My desk has a deep top middle drawer with no dividers. Bought this and it fits and works great!! Very durable and thick dividers between pockets!
0,I love these repositionable mini ultra tabs. The size is perfect for flagging areas. The colors are easily seen and the tabs have a matt texture to the colored tabs so that writing on them is easy and they feel good to your fingers. I will always keep a stash of these so that I can mark areas in my textbooks, calendar, and writing tablets.
0,Great product. A favorite Zentangle tool. Hard to find. Thanks Amazon!
0,love it just right
0,I really like the size of these. I do design work so I ship daily in smaller boxes. These are larger than standard air pillows, allowing me to use just 1 in a USPS 7X7X6 Priority Mail box. Also, seller communication was great and the item shipped fast. Thanks!
0,Just what I orders, shipped quickly good quality.  Thank you.
0,I would recommend Sakura pens to anyone. I can write small and they don't bleed through the page. I use them for other projects as well and absolutely love them!
0,These are the neatest most convenient boxes!  Fold together, sturdy, no tape needed.  I'll be saving them.  I ordered them twice for my upcoming move.
0,Very nice quality. Much smaller in size than expected. It came on time and in good condition. So far it weights accurately.
0,Love these for storage. Sturdy and a manageable size. Great price too.
0,These are fine!
0,Arrived quickly and great price.
0,Works perfect for my A5 Filofax.
0,I highly recommend this item. It keeps all my important site at my finger tips. Never have to remember my passwords for any of my on line sites!
0,Good quality paper.  I love the assorted colors!
0,I use a lot of orange highlighter. It's nice you can order 1 color. Thank You
0,Works great, no streaks and the marker comes off completely. I definitely recommend!
0,quick shipping - great quality
0,I bought this as a mail holder to put by my front door and also to hang my keys on. It comes with screws and is very easy to hand up. It's so cute and is really handy!!
0,I got a horrific case of poison ivy a couple months ago, and after recovering I bought this.		Now I use this product AND I also now wear long pants, a long sleeve shirt, and gloves, and I'm very careful to not wipe my face while working.  As soon as I'm done working I take a hot shower and scrub like crazy, and I wash all my clothes in very hot water.  Before I wasn't nearly as careful.		I haven't gotten poison ivy since doing all of this.  I do think a large part of the protection is from fully covering myself and washing right afterward, but I do think the Ivy Block does really help.  I put it all over my hands and arms, and on my legs below the knee.  My hands do feel a bit odd after putting it on--remember doing pottery at summer camp and afterward you'd sort of wash your hands but after they dried you'd still have clay residue on them?  It's a lot like that.		But like I say, I think the stuff works.  And considering that it's $15 for two bottles and a bottle will last for a year of occasional yard work, and considering that a case of poison ivy hurts like holy #@%(*@ and you're going to pay $20 to see a doctor and $20 for the prednisone to cure it, the Ivy Block is a great deal.  I recommend it.
0,Expo is the only brand of dry erase markers we use at home. They are low odor and make very well. Dark ink and they do not dry up quickly.
0,I gave this a five star because it solved my problem with little fuss. One roll lasts a long time and it's so easy to use.  I have sloping shoulders and my bra straps are always slipping off my shoulders, very uncomfortable.  Problem solved!
0,I bought these on a whim and I have to say, I actually love these pens. I will be buying more to stock up as I still seem to lose them regularly.... They write great, on many surfaces, and I like the texture and feel. I'm not sure that a pen can make office work feel like rainbows and sunshine, but these are as comfy as it gets.
0,I have just started a large archive scanning project using the Epson Perfection V700.  So far I am impressed.  It was easy and quick to set up and get scanning (Windows 8 host).  Even with the basic Epson Scan software, the scanner does an excellent job and gives me a fair amount of control over the output.  I have done a test in which I scanned some prints and had the scans printed at a local store.  My wife could not tell a difference between the originals and the new prints from the scanned images.  In fact, she had a slight preference for the new prints.  Larger prints also came out well.  I have only tried slides in a test case so far, but the results were very good.  I do think it helps to read some good scanning tip style web sites since you can easily have a negative impact on the quality and speed if you don't try to optimize the scans for what you really need. All in all I think the v700 is a very good solution.
0,This is a good deal for the amount of bright paper. They are all very eye-catching. The purple, however, is too dark to print on.
0,really pretty and unusual.
0,Very handy for Clip-N-Ship for home pick up of packages
0,loved it.
0,Gorgeous set of glitters in a variety of slightly different sizes (some standard, some skinny). The colors are spectacular - will make for a fun craft session with the kids!
0,Great value and made very well.
0,PERFECT FOR SCHOOL
0,I bought this as something to play with since it looked pretty cool and I am always looking for the next neat little widget for my toolbox. After playing with it for a day or so, I was bonding all sorts of stuff just for the heck of it. All-in-all it works well for its intended purpose. However, I may have found its real purpose at least for me. I was spooling my reels with braid for the new year and when I went to put the leaders on I normally use rubber cement to help the knots go through the guides. With this sitting on my work bench I decided to see what it could do. Wow does it work extremely well for smoothing out a knot. Unlike other products it also seems to add some strength to the knot.
0,No Problem
0,Lovely opaque white gel pen! So versatile for both crafters and fine artists!
0,Thanks!
0,Good alternative for a land line
0,Works great and allow my office supplies to stay intact.
0,Great product. Does its job. Will buy this brand again. Hasnt jammed up like my Barsika safe has. Easy to operate.
0,I bought these for Bible journaling. I like them very much. They remind me of softer see thru crayons. They glide on very easily and do not bleed thru the page. I will reorder these when I need to.  I hope they come out with even more colors.
0,I absolutely love this pencil.  I love the 1.3mm lead and the pencil itself is very comfortable to use.  The eraser is a little on the small side for me but not worth taking a star off for.
0,Attached one to my Mother's hearing aides by tying a ribbon between them and using a safety pin to attach to the back of her collar.  She has dementia and hides them from her caretakers.  Now, problem solved.
0,Love these. Perfect for my needs.
0,Well made dry erase eraser...
0,good price. happy with purchase
0,I had to buy a gift and saw this. I bought one for the gift and got myself one too. I am so pleased with this item and don't know how they can sell it for such a low price. They give you erasers and lead, divide the price in four and it make each item cost about $1.00. It can't be beat. This Pencil is amazing, my friends don't get why i get so excited over a pencil. But its not just any pencil. The only reason i throw away my pencils is because i erase a lot, so my pencil is useless, when the erasers gone within less than a week. I love this pencil. Amazing. I seriously recommend this to anyone and everyone! I Mean its more money than a normal pencil, but how often do you find a find with about a 3 times bigger eraser than an average eraser? Totally worth it though, i'm very happy with my purchase, and i'm hoping you will be to. :)
0,This is exactly the one I use at my federal government job. I put my ID on one side and a credit card on the other. It was a little difficult to pull out the credit card the first couple of tries; but it loosened enough over 2 weeks to be just right--not too loose, not too tight. I was so excited to find this, because the one I was issued looked yellowed and dirty.
0,Even though we haven't had it long, I like it.  It seems easy to work, and set up.  I can read everything easily.  It has good sound and lights up when using. I would recommend this so far.  Also called once to ask a question and got to talk to a live technician without any trouble.  This is important to me.
0,These thank you cards are great to keep on hand because they will work for any situation or occasion for which you want to express your appreciation.  The set includes 36 heavy card stock note cards which fold to measure 4.75" x 3.5" and 38 envelopes made in the USA.  As pictured, six colors with a textural design are included making the cards appropriate for a male or female recipient.  Having these cards on hand has allowed me to send thank you cards when I have it on my mind and I never forget to express my thanks!  Considering their high quality and versatility, I would definitely recommend these thank you cards.
0,Consistently writes very smoothly! I love roller ball pens.
0,This is an OEM cartridge that is as advertised. Lasts reasonably well and the price is right. I avoid replacements and refills - not worth the few pennies saved.
0,Thank you
0,Just the size I needed. No issues whatsoever.
0,Just received this printer and I have to say the print quality is excellent, the printing speed typical of inkjets, and the fact that I don't have to buy another cartridge - OUTSTANDING!!! Care should be taken when filling the tanks for the first time, wear gloves and make sure you have a paper towel handy for drips but otherwise this is a simple foolproof process. Tanks are clearly labeled with the color as well as ink number, there are rubber caps and a spot to hold the caps for each tank while filling. The ink that is supplied fills the tanks to capacity, I'll let you know in about 2 years if they last as they say they will. The supplied ink is supposed to be good for 6500 prints, so that may be awhile. Once powered up the device takes about 20 minutes or so to prep itself for the first time then it is ready to print. My first print was a photograph and the resulting print was excellent quality. I used some pretty cheap thin stock, but the image was vivid and the color looked perfect. I had expected a few bad prints to warm the device up but it's prepping cycle was sufficient to feed the ink to the empty print heads and get it all warmed up and completely ready to print on demand. This multi-function device replaces a HP 7900 series that was huge and bulky in comparison. This printer takes a little over half the space of the HP, a quality not easily overlooked on my very cluttered desk.  Scanning was perfect as well as the 1 touch copy. I gave these features a quick test with a high resolution image. Without a microscope the original and copy are indistinguishable from one another. I highly recommend that if your shopping for a inkjet you invest in this product, it does not disappoint.

0,One thing I've always appreciated about 5-star is the quality and durability you can expect. This 5 subject delivers. It holds up in a backpack or brief case. It even comes with a guarantee but I've never had to exercise that. It's hefty enough that you're okay writing on your lap or without a hard surface underneath.	I only wish there would've been more total pages..200 spread out over 5 subjects doesn't leave a lot for each.
0,These work perfectly in our HP all in one printer (photosmart D110a) and produce excellent prints for a reasonable price. The cart lasts quite a long time.
0,Bright neon colors with fun scents. What's not to like. Like others have mentioned, these are actually more like highlighters than markers, which are perfect for me. They smell good, and I used them in my calendar and to-do list to highlight reminders that I want to stand out. They smell good too. Fun markers, great colors, fun scents. I think most kids would get a kick out of these.
0,Works great.
0,Just right for my wall and I'm very please
0,fine

0,Great Product!!!
0,works as it should
0,A lot of these colors are too dark to use when highlighting. Slightly disappointed with this purchase.
0,I watched my paper thin aluminum trash bin disintegrate in front of my eyes.  Then when I went to purchase a replacement, all I could find was polished chrome finish for an unseemly price!  Figured might as well spent the few extra $$ on something a but more substantial that was NOT polished chrome but white like I wanted (to match my kitchen appliances).  This bin is amazing.  It's heavy, solid construction. And I love it.
0,Loved the expanding file folders! Fast delivery, we'll packaged, item just as described. A+
0,Nice colors and just the right hardness of the lead.
0,Great product for many years. Make me remember high school.
0,These are so great for our security/access badges.  it keeps the dust out and can accommodate multiple cards.
0,I've become quite a fan of Parker inks.  I used to be a bit of a snob and have purchased all sorts of expensive inks from around the world but after all that waste of money I find I really like just the plain old Quink inks the best.  They don't gum up my fountain pens and the ink dries fast so there is a minimum of smudging.  On the down side, you need to know what the limitations are.  This is of course not permanent (the bottle says washable) and it does bleed through cheap paper a bit although not as bad as most blue inks I have used (like Waterman).  My experience has been that all blue inks bleed through cheap paper.  I've never found one that didn't but this one is one of the better ones on that score.  I also really like the color which is more of a blue-blue rather than a blue-black.  If you need something permanent and which will not bleed through any paper no matter how cheap - try Noodler's Bulletproof Black Ink.  It's awesome.
0,Pros	----	- Extremely Sturdy	Once locked in place, the legs provide rock solid support and stability for the table. The lengthy horizontal bars at the end of the legs and the wide cross-legged support is so steady I'm confident that it cannot possibly be tipped over accidentally.		- Resilient Paint Coating	The coating of textured paint is resilient to corrosion and chipping		Cons	----	- Lack of a lock to lock the folded table in place once collapsed. It has to be leaned against the wall to keep it in the vertical collapsed position - which is just fine if that's where it's staying put and you don't plan on moving it around		Overall	-------	The Lifetime table is extremely stable. It can be easily folded up and put away when you don't needed it. My only complaint is that once folded, the legs cannot be locked in place. Otherwise, the Lifetime table is a quality piece of furniture that comes in real handy when you need an extra table.
0,I love the tiny little point - makes light, sharp lines. A great little gel pen.
0,I would not order this excellent brand of ink from MyOfficeInnovations again.  The packaging, a plastic bag, was of low quality and as a result the box that held the ink cartridge was smashed.  Luckily, the ink cartridge did not sustain any damage.
0,So pro!
0,The writing surface measures 8 inches wide by 9 1/2 inches high. The frame adds an average of half inch all around for an overall measurement of 9" x 11". The frame is a light, white plastic with a rounded top and bottom. I don't know why the top and bottom frames are curved in this way. Perhaps esthetics? For me, it makes the board just the tiniest bit less useful when I use it at the computer because I can't easily lean it against a non-magnetic surface and have it stand. But most of the time, I hang it by its magnetic backing to a metal panel or a refrigerator or I use it like a piece of paper at my desk. The size makes it perfect for quick calculations and making notes as I do research. The included Quartet dry erase black pen writes smoothly, erases easily with the brush of a finger, tissue, or cloth. Even after making lots of notes, the white surface is still erasing cleanly without a ghosting of previous marker. I especially like the little foam squares that are used for mounting. You can use the little white squares with their sticky backing to hang the board somewhat permanently on a surface or you can attach the flat magnets to the little white squares and make it more portable. I have chosen to do the latter and it works great. My only complaint is the curved edge on the bottom frame. Not much of a complaint at all!
0,As a book lover, I am always looking for ways to keep my collection organized. I also want to keep my beloved older books, perhaps those with some financial as well as emotional value, in as close to heirloom condition as possible. Yes, my family reads books and,yes,we don't treat them with kid gloves.		However, we also know that pasting anything into a book reduces it's value- with rare exceptions. At the very least....before using this kit, check out the value of your books before permanently attaching anything to it.		Simply do a search online to see how books are priced according to condition. or use a reference book&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ABC-for-Book-Collectors/dp/1584561122/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ABC for Book Collectors</a>&nbsp;on book collecting, one includes resources for appraisal  ( many are free). The book listed above - and it's link- is there only as one example of resources.		Have a valuable book? Pick up an inexpensive edition and use the library kit to keep track of it. But keep the collectible copy as pristine as possible.		Why? Because  a valuable - pr potentially valuable - book which is described as "new" or " like new" is NOT a book which has library cards in it. Think your books will never increase greatly in value? So have other book buyers who later discover that a true  first edition of Harry Potter soared in value ( haven't checked recent prices on those). So while this library kit is definitely appealing and attractive, just be sure to "vet" or check prices on your books,especially those which are older or out of print - before using The Personal Library Kit.		Otherwise,you could end up with books which go from valuable to being worth mere pennies. Just some cautions here.
0,ok
0,beautiful and functional.
0,good
0,I always like Scotch brand tape
0,When I got this I wasn't sure I would like it.  I use this in my home office with my primary workstation after using it now for several months, I have grown to like it.  It doesn't move, is very thin so that the keyboard can overlap it and just works well.
0,Stickers are a good size and the red is bright and clear. Press firmly or they can peel.
0,Nice reliable phone
0,Good, deep color. Finer point. Takes a couple sentences of writing for ink to flow deeply sometimes. Nib takes a bit to fully soak up ink. This can be annoying. One other thing is that the cap is secure when covering pen but when using the pen and placing cap on back end, cap doesn't feel as secure. So while you're writing it seems prone to slide off a little. I find myself pressing on it a lot to make sure it doesn't come off and roll off table. Wish they had more dozen packs in other colors like purple...not pink or red.
0,Dries up quick if you don't use daily
0,The marketing gimich on these are the scented markers-all of them smelled great except the nacho cheese. That one I don't know what happened there but that was a miss. But the other ones were great my favorite being the root beer one. Strong scents which I love. My sons favorite is the popcorn one. Also makes the pictures smell for quite awhile after being put on paper.		Would still recommend- 5 out of 6 is not bad at all!
0,I only recently discovered these and found them convenient to use even with my arthritic hands.  They are very fine tips--I confused them with the larger tips on my order but like them. Don't forget to click-em shut when you're finished--they dry out quickly.  I will use them for Stocking Stuffers. Good buy as an ADD ON purchase for 3.99 right now in Tri Color only!  (12/9/14).
0,This is my daughter's favorite scientific calculator. She specifically sought out this particular one on Amazon because her peers have them as well and she stated it is the most user friendly.
0,works good  and very easy to use Thanks
0,I wish it did color as well, but so far it has far exceeded  my needs, love it
0,After over 15 hears of dealing with back pain and trying various products for support and relief, I honestly can say that if my back could speak, it would thank you for being pain free when sitting for any length of time for the first time in years.		Thank you
0,Works great!
0,I like everything about this product besides the eraser. When you try to erase things, the eraser just goes back in the slot so it's impossible to erase. I have the same kind of pencil that is a different brand and don't have this problem.
0,I purchased this lead pencil for my son. He loves sketching and uses this pencil quite a bit.
0,My second favorite set of coloring pencils. They tend to get a wax build up if you layer too much and sometimes when you sharpen them, the tip breaks during the sharpening process and you must sharpen again.... So wasteful! Also, you must sharpen them much more frequently than my favorite pencils.... polychromes by farber. Still worth buying though because they're great and there are so many colors!!
0,Good Product.
0,Student was able to hit the ground running. Nice display. Nice sized buttons and high quality screen. Great price, and if it gets lost, we would reorder.
0,I use these only for writing on sheet music. I've tried many different pencils out there - Magic Writer, Ticonderoga, Mirado Black Warrior, even the other Blackwings. This one is the darkest and writes like butter. You can see the writing in lowlight situations and the pencil never tears through the paper as I sometimes find with mechanical pencils. The eraser erases well for a pencil top eraser, but I use a separate Japanese eraser that completely gets rid of the dark pencil marks. The Blackwing 602 is my next favorite after this one.
0,Love these sharpies!!!!
0,ITS TAPE. IT WORKED
0,Great
0,Exactly what she wanted.
0,Love this cart.  I use it to haul stuff in and out of meetings.  It holds everything and folds away until I need it again.  Ordered this because I needed good wheels to run on gravel areas.  This has good wheels.
0,I had trouble using this item at first but one of our school district "tech people" came and figured out that I needed to use the back laptop usb plug in.  Really great slim design.  Perfect for a side pocket.  Wonderful for use in the classroom!  You can be at any point to redirect attention and walk among the students for better explanations.  The best part is...the company is WONDERFUL!  Great customer service! Very personable and responsive!
0,You have to put the thing together and the directions aren't the most helpful. However, after 10 minutes of fiddling with it I figured it out and now it works fantastic. Exactly what I needed. I have about 100 total borders stored in it so far, and it's not even 1/4 full. And, it fits perfectly under my shelves in my classroom closet.
0,Good fountains pens for the price.	These took a while to get to me (lost package) but I was happy when they arrived.		I've flushed and filled the converters in each of the pens.	6 of the 8 of these pens write smoothly. The orange and black demonstrators don't. Unfortunately those are the ones I was looking forward to the most. The nibs on those two are scratchy as of now. The ink flow on the orange one is mediocre unless pressure is applied while writing. I'm going to try smoothing out the nibs and separating the tines on the orange one.	The other 6 have smooth nibs with good ink flow.		These Jinhao pens have "medium" nibs. I've measured and compared lines. These nibs produce a little under 1mm lines, comparable to a 0.9 pencil.	Convertors seem a little fragile, but none have leaked so far.		I actually prefer these pens over Lamy Safaris. These Jinhaos are light and easy to hold. Lamys are heavier and too top heavy when caps are posted. For the price of 8 of these, you could only get one Lamy.		These pens would be good for students and everybody looking for a low cost pen.		Overall, Ive had a good experience with these pens. Will update as needed.
0,Thank you.
0,Great digital scale. Better than other 5 stars scales.
0,Its tape and it works well.
0,colorful and erasable with smooth writing
0,Thanks
0,Great phone system for our large three-level  home.  Saves us running to answer incoming calls and enables us to talk in comfortable locations of our choosing.  Still learning how to use all the useful features and probably won't use all of the more advanced and exotic ones.  But am  looking forward to learning how to use the intercom capability.  Also, it was remarkably easy for me -- who is not the least bit techie -- to set up.
0,These pens follow the typical path most erasable ink pens follow IMO...		They erase fine...but the ink isn't very fluid, and it writes average.		Overall a solid erasable ink pen.
0,This is a large printer, at least by home use standards.  For work standards it's probably on the small side.  It only holds 250 sheets of paper (this is pretty normal, although smaller for work standards where generally the larger printers hold an entire ream -- You can buy additional paper trays as well if needed -- although it will make it taller).		It includes a scanner, and also an ADF (Automatic Document Feeder -- which lets you easily copy/scan multiple things).  The output (where the printed paper comes out) can store lots of sheets of paper, and is nicely inset so you don't have to have a large tray pulled out.  It can also do duplex printing.		One small downside is that you either need to plug it into USB or you need to hard wire it via ethernet, this does not include WiFi built in.  The good news is once it is hooked up to the network it can do AirPrint, Google Cloud Print among others.		This also supposedly has Amazon Dash replacement service built in, which will automatically order new toner for you, which for a small business would be amazing, although for a home user it might be a bit scary getting hit with a $100 plus charge.  (It comes with a 3000 page toner cartridge, the full version will do 8000 pages, so by volume it's still incredibly cheap).		For home use the downside is it doesn't print color, but it prints great black and white, and it does it so fast, love this for general printing.
0,innovative product!
0,Works well for what it is. No issues.
0,Beautiful note cards.  Elegant .  It took me a long time and many places to find these cards.  Great for any occasion.  Just love them.
0,Really great buy! I initially purchased to hold my craft vinyl but then I found a more permanent solution for my craft room. I decided to take this to my classroom and it.is.perfect!	I was able to put this under my sink cabinet where I keep all the construction paper. This is a GREAT size because I purchase the large packs and the smaller packs of construction paper. it has bowed or buckled with the weight of the paper.  I probably wouldn't use this as student work cubbies just because the compartments are so deep their work would get lost. But this would be great for the art teacher's classroom to have art dry or to store supplies.
0,A good support.
0,great
0,I love these tabs.  A hint is not to take off both sides at the same time.  Take one side off -- secure it to the paper... then pull the cover off of the back side and secure it to the back side.  Less waste and it works better!
0,I am very pleased with the way the shredder functions.  It is very powerful and fast.  The only negative is that the top of the shredder is very heavy to lift when you have to empty the bin.  Also, since this machine has to be oiled periodically, it would have been nice if some oil was included.
0,I would give it a 5 if it had a few more common words. My son get frustrated when he wants to make certain sentences and the word isn't there. I wish the words were singular and had a few S tiles instead of the word being plural. We made some small paper tiles and it solved these minor issues. Overall, would recommend and buy again.
0,This was just what I was looking for. I wanted something that would hold many different color marker and an eraser.		Pros:	-Big enough for 15 markers.	-Adhesive tape sticks extremely well(make sure you clean the area you stick it to with alcohol first)(it doesn't tell you to do that, but common sense)		Cons:	-There is no way for the markers to stand up.. they all fit laying down, but then you can't see all the colors. It needs dividers and it does not come with any. I added a divider made from card board and tape and that solved the problem. Now the markers stand, and the eraser has its own area.
0,Great stocking stuffer!  Great gift for any occasion.  Very Durable hinge closure.  Refill paper pads are available, as are the pens.  The pens run out of ink quickly, but kind of expected for a small pen.  Great to fit in your pocket or your purse.  There are masculine designs available too, for men.
0,This is some of THE BEST tape. Maybe a little more expensive than some. But it is QUALITY =)
0,Love them. They hold a lot. I bought some for my daughter, then ordered more for myself. I will definitely be ordering more.
0,Exactly what we needed.  Thank you

0,Great product and a great price.  Very good quality.  Thanks.
0,I really like the Wilson Jones binder, especially the ones with the cover page on the front and the spine. That makes it so much easier to identify the notebook and what it holds. The Wilson Jones binders have the 1.5 inch binders which can hold up to 330 sheets. They are perfect for my financial papers.
0,Like the bright colors
0,Perfect!
0,The best pencils, I already threw out my mechanical ones.
0,I love these envelopes and I am still using them weekly!  They are perfect for shipping my small ebay items with and the protection provided is ideal!!  Highly recommend these!
0,I love fountain pens, and now prefer them over ball point or gel pens. I own two pilot fountain pens that work well. They were cheap pens, and now after using this pen I know why people spend a little bit more for a better quality of pen. This pen writes so smooth and is perfectly balanced.	This pen comes with an awesome ink converter that will suck up ink from a well if you want to use it. I however, being clumsy, use the ink cartridges. The cartridges that I use can be found at https://amzn.com/B00CQF69SO.	I bought this product without the box and it came in a bubble raped envelope. it arrived sooner than expected and works perfectly.		*I purchased this using a discount, however this does not reflect in my review of the product.
0,I bought these colored pencils to use with some adult coloring books that couldn't hold up to markers.  These pencils seem to be working well for me, they arrive sharpened.  I did put them into a cigar box so I can sift through them more easily than the box when I am coloring.  I have not had any break and the colors go on evenly.  I found if you want a darker color it is best to go over that area 2-3 times rather than trying to push down and get a dark color without layering.  I use a manual little pencil sharpener with these.
0,GREAT
0,They work well!  Better than some of the more expensive ones and as well as the name brand I have used for years.  I find them very satisfying, and will certainly buy them again.!
0,Works great with the thermal laminator I bought
0,I got these as a present wouldn't have even chose these myself because I knew nothing about them boy am I glad I got a chance to use these they are not as soft as prismacolor (in my case that's a plus) but a firmer texture but I believe have better color saturation nice soft lay down as well not a lot white spots like other pencils the greens and reds purples are rich. Really an overall great pencil to either start with or to add to your collection would definitely buy again.
0,I just set this up last night with three 23.6" monitors. It is a VERY tight fit with minimal angle on the far left and right monitors. to get a better overall angle, I ended up rotating one of the monitors to use it in portrait mode (great for reading webpages) and angling the central monitor slightly towards the other monitor.
0,Very good !
0,Priced right and arrived quickly.  Just what I needed.
0,I gave these to my sons teacher for their class. I haven't heard any complaints so seems all is well.
0,Wilson Recycled Bliss, 5 pack binders have a nice retro look.  They are pretty and have a good thick feel to them.  They are supposed to be made with some recycled content which is always a plus but the majority of recycled content in these folders is pre-consumer (manufactures scraps, trimmings, ends, etc.). The divider holes do not appear to be reinforced.		The designs are colourful.  Truthfully, I think they would be a hit with teen girls as the designs and colours are mostly feminine.  I am using them in a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wilson-Jones-Ultra-Duty-Round-Ring-View-Binder-with-Extra-Durable-Hinge-1-Inch-Black-W87900PP2/dp/B00FX5Z9C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 1-Inch, Black (W87900PP2)</a>&nbsp;and they look elegant against the black binder.
0,Okay, I didn't buy this for its printing capabilities (and I'm sure it's great for that).		I bought it because it is by far the most affordable 11x17 scanner on the market.  And it absolutely does the job.		I had some very old material that size (printed on newsprint, so it was kind of rough and hard to handle) and this machine fed a total of about 250 11x17 pages (in small batches twice, once for each side) through its automatic document feeder VERY reliably.  It was the kind of paper you couldn't easily thumb through to count them even with damp fingers.  I had a couple of jams (no surprise), but I finally figured out it happened because I was overloading the feeder.		One thing to know about these models: even if you just want to scan, this machine will NOT boot up until you install the supplied starter ink cartridges.  No biggie, as that's very easy to do.		One thing more: this does not do duplex scanning; it does one side at a time if you use the feeder.  However, if you use a moderately clever automatic numbering system for your scans (with great scanning software like Vuescan -- Google it), you'll have no problem.  For example, scan all the odd-numbered sides of your pages first and have the software automatically number them 001, 002, 003, etc.  Then, reset the scan counter in your software and scan the even-numbered sides as 001a, 002a, etc. again using the document feeder.  When you later dump all these files into a single folder on either Windows or a Mac, they will automatically sort themselves properly:  001, 001a, 002, 002a, etc. which puts them in the order of the original document.  Then, it's easy to convert all the scans to a single .PDF.		Anyway, just wanted to sing the praises of yet another great Brother value.  Happy scanning.
0,Great product
0,My daughter loves this agenda.  Great for students
0,These are colorful and work well.
0,What's to say about business card stock? It just prints nicely although I have to be careful to let ink dry before touching. The cards snap apart better than some I've used.
0,I love this paper
0,I love these mousepads, they're the only kind we use. Only buy Innovera brand though, the generics are terrible and leak.
0,The mouse pad works as a mouse pad should.  The wrist support supports the wrist.  I wore my last one out after 10 years, so I replaced it with this one. Case closed.
0,AAA
0,This printer fits my needs perfectly. Nothing fancy here, just a simple to use printer. Fast, high quality printing while taking up little space. Excellent bang for the buck!		Easy to install. I had to install drivers (CD included) for my laptop (Windows 7) before I could start printing, but the effort/wait was worth it.		FYI - No USB cable included, sold separately.
0,Accurate, heavy duty, and connects to PC to use with bundled software and to calculate shipping costs with multiple carriers. Love it
0,I've tried about 8 of these in the last 5 years and this has been the best. The ones with motor fans all broke in less than 10 months, often faster.		This one is lightweight and soft, and keep my legs from getting red marks from the laptop. The laptop still kicks out a lot of heat, yet when I put my hand on the bottom to the lapinator, there is no heat there. I have 2 laptops and got 1 for each.		One thing I do for my own use is a take a box cutter knife and I slice open 1 of the 2 foam feet on the bottom. That way the stand and my keyboard are lower where my wrists come onto it. It easy to take the foam out, you just slice a line along the bottom of the fabric, lift it up and pull the piece of foam out. I did it 14 months ago and the fabric has not frayed even a bit where I cut the opening.		Probably only 1 in 6 would find added benefit bit cutting 1 piece of foam out, but I mention it so you have the option after you get it.		I think 99% of people will like the lapinator as is. The price is also good.
0,Bought a box of these to write spells into a Grimoire.  Perfect!  The size of the pen is perfect, and the black color is ok!

0,A+++
0,What can anyone really say about a bankers box?		Sturdy? Check.	Easy to set up? Check.	Holds a lot? Not this size, but it holds just enough so it is not too hard to lift the box.	Ample space for writing? Yes.	Color? Kraft.
0,Perfect, extactly what we needed.
0,I have a tape gun that annoys the heck out of me.  I saw our school librarian using one of these and thought it was genius - and it is!  First, it's super heavy so it stays put as you're tearing.  Second, it's very sharp and I can easily cut off the length of tape that I need.  3rd - the tape end doesn't get stuck to the roll.
0,Contact points weak - they tend to deform and slip out of the casing. Cannot put them back in. Fixed with a not-so-great bending of the contacts. Connectivity for communications is great.
0,I like Epson ink cartridges. They last a while in my printer before I have to replace them again. They produce rich colors that I am printing. I come out with sharp images. The prints are as good  if not better then what I would get at a photo store.
0,Received on time and worked as advertised.
0,Good, but too "plasticy".
0,I've used Prismacolor colored pencils for years. The price on this was too good to pass by. A nice addition to my art supplies.
0,Really capable safe...bolt it to a floor or wall!
0,This is not what you would get for extension cords. It is fantastic for a docking station or organizing light weight cords in your car.  Worked out great for all of my charging cords (phone,  iPad, kindle, headset, mp3......etc)
0,we will see what my co-workers think.

The gold accents on the converter complement the large nib and gold accents on the pen nicely and can even be faintly seen throught the pen, which is just slightly translucent. While hard to explain it gives the pen an very nice look. The tip of the converter friction fits into the nib section of the 3776 and stays in place. Of my 9 pens this is the only that fits this way and I have to say I like it the most.
0,Great price.  Saved a bundle!

0,Good heavy paper.

0,The XL cartridges for Canon are amazing in how long they last. They're also a lot less expensive than some of the XL-type cartridges I've purchased for other printers. Not only is the black ink great, but so is the color ink.
0,I love it! Getting things straight is so easy now!
0,Fantastic
0,They do just fine.

0,Who does not like a 3 pack of tape? It's pretty much a basic of life.

0,Same as what you get from a financial institution.  This is much easier to order a bunch of registers than get one or two from a bank.
0,Great buy !!!

0,I received these four pens quickly after ordering them.  They came securely packaged in bubble wrap with each pen in its own protective sleeve.		The pens I received are all the fine nib models with the piston fill feature.  These are nice features for such inexpensive pens.		I have inked and written with two of the four pens so far and both have written smoothly with little to no scratchiness depending on the paper used.  The pen colors are nice soft pastels matching the item picture quite closely.  These pens are a great choice for those looking for budget piston filling pens.  I would highly recommend them!
0,Perfect - great product!
0,My favorite company for inkjet cartridges!.  Their ink is always compatible with my printers.  And you get a FULL cartridge, not one that is almost full.  Easy to install.  And these people are very supportive with their products.  They emailed me to make sure that I was pleased with their ink, and offered assistance if I had problems.  Not many companies will go that far.		I will continue using their ink every time I can get it. A++
0,love it
0,I love the XL canon cartridges they seem to last so much longer than the regular ones.
0,What can you say, post its, they work
0,I already have a bottle of Apache Sunset but I found that the red-yellow was a bit to bright for me to use frequently.  The brown-yellow in this one looks great and seems a bit more professional to me.  I'd highly recommend it.
0,I've used a variety of CD/DVD/Blu-ray markers over the years, and the one unifying factor is that they all stink. The watery, mushy pens quickly dry out and become unusable. Often they are bad out of the box.		Based on the positive reviews, I ordered a set of the Staedtler Lumocolor CD/DVD markers. Good move! The ink is dense and readable, the points sharp and the ink dries instantly. Also, the pens come in a clever hard plastic case with a folding lid that allows the pen case to sit upright on a desk or closed and protected in a drawer.		I've been using this product for 1-1/2 years and only the green pen has dried out. This is a solid five star product!
0,Perfect gel pens for coloring. The colors are bright and flow easily onto paper. I do a lot of coloring and enjoy using Lolliz gel pens. I have purchased these pens tseveral times and certainly will purchase them again.
0,Works great for filling up fountain pen cartridges.
0,Excellent product!!  Excellent seller!!
0,This is an amazing pen...best one I have ever used.		It is 'heavy' in the way a good pen should be, good balance, very well made, and the ink lasts for a very long time.  Solid brass construction. The finger grips are solid without being to deep as to cause discomfort after long periods of writing.		Vs. some of the high end $200-$300 pens this one is clearly better for writing, much better made, and far less costly.
0,I know people would prefer a sturdier pencil.  But don't drop it otherwise the tip will bent and lead can never come out without breaking into itself.  I prefer this width, cause I right tiny notes, and prefer the small width.		I studied Architecture, have 0.3, 0.5 , 0.7 and I think I have 0.9 or 1 mm, I can't recall.
0,I've tested several printers over the years, many of them Epsons, and the Epson WorkForce WF-2660 continues the manufacturer's tradition of offering high-quality all-in-one printers that are affordable and relatively well-made.		I have always used a wooden folding TV tray to hold my printer, which I keep next to my desk in my home office. This same tray table  has served this purpose for more than 10 years! With past printers of various makers, both sides would hang off a bit. However, with its compact size, the WorkForce WF-2660 fits completely - with 1.5 inches to spare on each side. Depth-wise it also completely fits atop the tray table. Due to the Epson WorkForce WF-2660's speed of printing, there is a little wobble when printing but it has not effected print quality (no blurs).		One feature I really like is "Epson Connect," a Web-based interface accessible by computer, tablet of smartphone. With Epson Connect you can:	 - Print remotely from anywhere	 - Manage settings: paper size, enable/disable photo paper printing, and more	 - Scan to PC, email or "the cloud" (Evernote, Google Drive, Dropbox, Box,	 - View print log		I like the option of 2-sided printing, however, for me it's only available when making copies, NOT printing documents. I've attempted to rule out user-error because I've checked and double checked every possible setting and connection. I have tried it with all 3 Macs in our house (we don't have a PC to test with the printer). I also checked with support and I'll edit this review with a fix (even if it was due to "user error" on my end) when I get that sorted out. Again, not sure if this is a general issue or a local one. :-)		2-sided printing is excellent for making color copies of brochures and also for printing short stories I write on occasion that I like to put into a binder and mail (snail mail) out to friends and family.		The Epson WorkForce WF-2660, in a nutshell:		Pros:	* Prints text and images fast - very fast!	* Text is very close to laser-printer quality	* Wireless connectively (wi-fi) = no wires and enables remote accessibility features.	* Touch-screen LED interface on printer	* Compact - smaller footprint then its Epson all-in-one predecessors.	* Scan documents/photos directly to your PC, an email address or cloud service.	* Prints excellent photos using photo paper and appropriate photo printing setting.	* Epson Connect: Web-based interface accessible by computer, tablet of smartphone. With Epson Connect you can:	 - Print remotely from anywhere	 - Manage settings: paper size, enable/disable photo paper printing, and more	 - Scan to PC, email or "the cloud" (Evernote, Google Drive, Dropbox, Box,	 - View print log		Cons:	* 2-sided printing only available when making copies, not printing documents. At least for this Mac user. Again, I'll update if I can enable it.	* Image printing is very good but not laser-printer quality on regular documents (reports, etc.) BUT printing photos with photo paper is another story A+ there for the high quality. Just wanted to point out that if printing reports, the images are not quite (close though) the caliber of glossy brochures.		In summary, the Epson WorkForce WF-2660 is an well-designed and economical all-in-one printer that's compact, fast and full of convenient cloud-sharing features.
0,They work great.
0,Like this glue because it goes on clear and dries clear.  Regular white glue is good for paper crafting, but I like clear so I can see where to glue things.  Also, paper doesn't seem to wrinkle as much as with white glue.  Doesn't stick well to photo images, so if you are gluing photos or slick prints, there might be better adhesive products for that. I don't know if it is archival, acid free, or UV resistant (not on the label).  It does like to bubble when drying so you have to watch that.  The product is made in China and is listed as nontoxic.  Cost a little more than Elmers white glue but other than that, it works for my paper crafts.
0,It needed some helps. I wasn't "fat" enough and since my kindle and iPad are in cases, couldn't fit in the slot. So I jury rigged it to work. Velcored a pillow I made to the bottom and added a small shelf to the top. It works better now. At least for me.
0,In my opinion, these are the best journals ... some have line spacing too wide, but this one is just right for me as a serious journal keeper.  Well constructed, excellent quality paper used throughout and quite durable.  Have not boiled down my journal choices to these in various colors after keeping journals for 41 years and counting.
0,I was so tired of my old shredder jamming up with just a few papers so I upgraded to this model.  It is the best shredder I have ever owned.  It is quiet and has never jammed on me, so far.  I use regular 13 gallon kitchen bags instead of specialty bags, and they work very well.  I also bought the container of oil and just oil it when I change trash bags.
0,This safe is nice. Can be keyless with a code or it comes with two keys as well. I like it that way. It's big enough to fit important papers and my wedding ring and a few other belongings. Good size for us.
0,I am not quite sure what the leatherette means, but these are strong nice yellow folders.  They are PAPER, that has a textured feel on them by Oxford.  You would probably find them at your local Office Supply store, but these seem more solid and better put together than any paper folder I have found in the past.
0,These are AMAZING - they actually conform to my wrists instead of being hard plastic filled with gel.  Highly recommend for those of you on computers alot and sore wrists.
0,I love these pens, they write well and so many cool colors!
0,I like this calendar - it's handy to keep in our kitchen.  Easy to hang on a simple nail. Its construction makes it easy to take off the wall when making plans and easy to put back.  Nice quality.  I'm picky about calendars, so I'm glad to have this one.

0,it's just like the picture - I was hoping though that it was a little thicker, so I could keep more things in it
0,Good
0,cheap, and works...	on some rings, when putting on a wide key, sometimes the ring does not recover (ie. doesn't lay flat...)... fortunately it's cheap so when the first ring didn't work, the next one did...
0,Among other things I am a public speaking coach and trainer.  One of the things that I emphasize is the need for speakers to take their equipment seriously.  Find the best, learn how to use it, then master it and then buy another one as a back up (and pack it separately from your primary remote if you are traveling).		There are a couple of requirements that I have for a remote control presentation device:		*  It should work by RF and not IR - I have been frustrated too many times by the line-of-sight limitations of infrared controllers. Radio frequency controllers are the only ones that I will use or recommend.		*  It should have a "blank screen" button.  The presenter should be able to turn the screen black when necessary so that the audience pays attention to the speaker, not the screen.		*  Mouse-control can really help you when using Power Point programs.		*  Volume-control keeps the presenter from having to walk over to the computer and adjust the sound.		*  A strong laser pointer.		This controller has all of that plus more.  I strongly recommend it to all of my clients, it's really that good.
0,Works great to package things that we don't want people using scissors on.
0,Great deal.
0,great ink
0,They are very good on whiteboards.
0,Definitely a Valentines day card.... But the focus is on the sex, not the romance.  I think my husband will love this card, but you have to think about what your partner would like.  The jumbo size makes a great impression!
0,the pages are kind of slipery when your just trying to put them in but thats nothing and once you get them in they work great i love them though i should have picked prettier colors hehe personal preference there.
0,A great pen. If you are a beginner this or Jinhao pens are your best way to get into it.
0,Exactly as described by seller.. So fa I'm pleased! Will definitely reorder..
0,Product Just as Described! Great Colors and Great Bargain!
0,Very good paper for the price.
0,Updated review, 7 Feb 14.		This printer has been superseded by other Brother models--that's why it's so expensive. I paid less than one hundred fifty bucks for another one just about a year ago when they were being phased out. Get a newer model. There's nothing about this printer that makes it worth more than 4 times what it cost when it was in production.		The 5340 has quit working after I tried the defeat on the "replace cartridge" message. Nothing I do will fix it.		_____________________________________		Original Review:		I own both the HL-5340D and 5370DW model (same printer but the 70 has wireless networking). Solid, bulletproof workhorse printers for small office.		Do yourself a favor and read the reviews about how to defeat Brother's "replace cartridge" messages. By defeating the warning messages, I've gotten more than 1500 additional sheets from the cartridge--long after Brother says it's empty and needs to be replaced. You have to clean the corona wire more frequently as the cartridge truly gets down toward empty, but it's worth the 30 seconds to do it on occasion.
0,I love that fact pens are sold at a low price also there are 60 in the box. I purchase a box at the beginning of the school for my daughter and it lasts us throughout the school year. The pens wright smoothly with nice clear lines no skipping or too much ink in one place. We have never had an issue with any of the pens running out of ink. Most of the time the pens are lost before running out of ink. Hands are never covered in ink from smudging , never a worry about allowing the-ink to dry before doing anything else with the paper

0,I teach middle school math.  I give out these pencils as a reward in my classes.  I give students a choice between this pencil and the rainbow silver with black wood Ticonderoga pencil.  this soft comfortable pencil is by far the more popular.  I gave four stars only because sharpening wis a bit of an issue.  This is probably not the fault of Ticonderoga, but there is no good sharpener that I can find for this larger pencil.  For my use I prefer the triangular yellow  pencils that get awesome points with my KUM Automatic sharpener.
0,I just got back into using fountain pens. A lot has changed since I last used them and it is all for the better! These pens come with a squeeze converter that means you can use a bottle of ink with great ease. The refills are also very easy to insert and use, no mess. I had forgotten how much I used to love using fountain pens and I'm so glad I gave it a try again.
0,this pen is better than your $50 cross pen, plated in gold and given at graduation. make a note of the ball point or the gold nib on some other pens and see if the process of pen-revolution hasn't begun with our friend Sharpie. inexpensive, well made. sold everywhere. runs a light or thick dark line good for letters and artistic drawings. travels well without exploding on airplanes or losing ink in embarrassing ways. i use Sharpies for writing notes, sketching everything from fine art to Surgical Drawings i sell to make a living. ink runs out consistently in an even flow. enough said.
0,These pens were very good. However, I wish there weren't two oranges very similar in color and a light green pen instead. Other then that; it's great. They came in a plastic case. Mine was really scratched if you put it at a certain angle, but I don't think I care that much, because I won't be keeping them in the case. My blue pen was the only one that had an issue. The pen kind of skipped, but after using it for a while, it stopped. I took out the ink barrels and wow they were really full. These will probably last me a while! The colors are very pretty and vibrant, and I kind of wish there were more colors! I'm kind of glad I bought the 0.4mm one instead of the 0.3mm because it is very fine. But I might still buy the 0.3mm one because these pens are the bomb (dot) com.
0,Just what it's supposed to be. No problems.

0,I have 4 of these in my office and they are such a fantastic way to promote sales, specials and information
0,These are very sturdy, which was just what my son needed and the extra built in pockets are a huge plus!
0,Absolutely a wonderful well made quality pencil wrap. The material, thickness and the print is sooooooo pretty. I absolutely loved it.  I got the 72 hole one and it holds my color pencils very nicely.  They are very easy to slip in and out when you want to use it. The price was excellent and this will make a wonderful gift for your coloring buddy.  I highly recommend this product.		I received this product at a discount to provide my honest opinion.

0,I did my research to try to get the best board for the best price.... and this seems to be the best.		The most popular board on amazon is around $10, so i gave that a shot. BAD IDEA. That board was garbage. The packaging was terrible. Absolutely no protection. Luckily, the package was destroyed when it got to my house. (obviously.... there was no packaging).....so i ended up returning it. I decided to check out the board before i returned it though and this is what i found.....		The cork quality was horrible too. The board only had like a paper-thin layer of cork....then the inside was hollow. the back was made of cheap cardboard and the pins would easily pierce through. The border was made of cheap wood too.		THIS BOARD:	Very sleek design with high quality cork! The cork is solid and the back is made of some nice plastic-like material. The aluminum boarder also makes it very pleasing to the eye!	The instructions given with this board are MAGNIFICENT!! It gives you an outline of the board so you can easily mount the board using the screws given to you. No measurements are really needed! it's done for you.		In conclusion.... the more money you spend, the better quality board you get. don't try to get an inexpensive board and expect a superior one. sure there are better boards out there, but this board seems to be the best priced one for the quality on amazon. ($22 + free shipping: the price i got it for)
0,As usual HP builds fantastic stuff and leaves the user to hack through the functionality with little instruction doc. Hang in there dudes/dudettes you'll figure it out eventually :-).
0,Good price & quality.
0,What Mom wouldn't love this with a new kindergartener in the house?  I label all my son't stuff and love that I can use different colors.  He loves it too and Sharpie is and will always be the best!
0,I have used many reams of this paper.  Never a jam, never an issue. About 1 penny a sheet is a good price.
0,March 13, 2016 :	I am concerned about the implications of enclosed guidance provided by this compatible toner cartridge manufacturer to avoid printer updates as they may 'interfere' with proper cartridge function. It is my opinion HP should capitalize on their considerable strengths, one being premier designers and producers of great printers, and ponder the effects of promoting (should they actually be doing so) cartridge lock-in schemes. Some consumers understand there's an inflated revenue stream from HP cartridge sales incorporated in the HP printer proforma. HP may not adequately appreciate the follow-on consumer calculation to first, buy their great loss-leader discounted printers then second, to look to the work-around innovation of compatible cartridge manufacturers for the supply of higher value cartridges. I think it would be good business to enable consumers to directly view remaining toner rather than black-box the cartridge status via microcontrollers as is the case today which obviously creates a significant so called moral hazard. The Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components Inc. case suggests HP's invention of alternative, less conspicuous consumer damaging options intended to replace an immediate printer microcontroller rejection of compatible cartridges may emerge in the future.

0,These work great for calendars! The variety is good, but didn't have everything I was looking for.
0,They work very well and last a long time.
0,Good for medium sized business.
0,Gel or ball point are my favorites. It's not an attractive looking pen, but a great one to keep in a desk or have as backup. i like the grip.
0,Perfect!
0,These feel a bit thinner than the polymailers I usually purchase, but since I sell clothing, hairbows, and other soft items, it probably won't be a problem for me. If you're mailing books, heavy or pointy objects, I would spring for a little better quality to ensure safe arrival.
0,This is not my first of these. The first was a gift from my daughter and I LOVE IT! I keep it daily for my grandchildren to know something of what was going on in the world on these days and to know a bit more of "MoMo" the person.
0,This would be my 2nd Lamy.  Ive never been disappointed.  They make a great everyday pen thats not so expensive that I cant afford to loose one.
0,This board is the same standard 3/16" board found in any craft store, only costing about two-thirds as much. It arrived quickly in good shape. It is hard to find ten sheet packs in stores consequently this is an even better value especially when you purchase enough not to have to pay shipping.
0,Ever since I was in elementary school, I have been a huge fan of gel pens.  This goes for the glittery ones, pastel colored ones, or just the plain black ones for taking notes.  As a 30 year old, I was just as ecstatic to get this HUGE pack of gel pens.  Usually in stores I only see smaller packs of gel pens, and they have limited palettes, so boy oh boy was I bouncing all over the place when I saw this pack!	There are 70 gels pens in this massive collection, and each one is different.  The set includes 17 metallic pens, 19 glitter pens, 15 neon pens, 15 pastel pens, and 4 standard ones.  Each pen is plastic, and the cap represents the color of the ink inside.  The ink flows onto paper smoothly with normal pen pressure, and stays consistent.  These gel pens are fantastic for adding some flair to notes taken in class, writing letters, doodling, or fully coloring a picture.	I really like the case that these pens came in.  There is a slot for each pen, so they stay put and don't roll around.  It's very easy to keep the colors organized this way.  Overall, I think this is a great set of gel pens.  Kids and adults alike can enjoy them.	I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I am always very honest and fair when reviewing an item, so please be assured that the product has earned the rating I have given it. I always read other customers' reviews before deciding on purchasing an item, so I take writing reviews seriously.
0,Love it because it works absolutely terrific! I will keep you apprised as to the durability of this shredder because I have bought about 10 different brands of shredder in the past years and it seems they last about a year and then die.  This is probably the best but its very loud.  I wear earplugs while using it for more than one page.  The biggest difference I have noticed between it and others is that it hasn't overheated.  I just went through about 3 feet high pile of papers and it didn't overheat.  ALL of the other shredders I have used in the past would have overheated and I would have had to wait a good bit of time for it to cool down.  No problem here!  Now the shreds are a little wider than some other shredders, but honestly, do you have neighbors who are waiting to tape back together all your strips?  I hope not!  Good luck to them on that anyway, cuz these aren't fat strips by any means.  Just a little wider.
0,What can I say?  It's quick versatile, but the image quality is not as good as what I get at work (on the "BIG" machines), so I don't print out masters on this machine at home to print at work, I wait until I get to work to print out important pages.	Buuuut, it does a great job of printing out drafts and regular pages (like grade printouts for students or individual assignments).
0,These are great for my day to day work life.  I have to keep lots of notes and this is better than a school composition book and cheaper than a journal.
0,Finally, a printer I really like to use. Easy and many functions. I have owned lots of printers and typically purchase Brothers. I stayed away from HP for a long time, but this one it working well and meets my needs.
0,Great vlaue.
0,Very well made and large. Works great for behavior charts and chore charts for my kids. I really like them and find them useful. I would buy again if needed.

0,Everything was ok
0,I really like this product, though it seems a bit overpriced to me. It works for those with techy inclinations. The instructions are clear. I consider the smooth separations between cards practically a miracle. The quality of the paper is nice. Sturdy enough to hold their shape nicely.		For those not-so tech minded, these could easily be hand printed or be great showoffs for calligraphy. I welcome the ease of printing a few at a time or many. I also like that one needn't  measure and cut. .
0,THANK YOU
0,Summary: Much more durable option than the standard 1" tape flags, but about 4 times more more expensive.		I use 1" tape flags at my job and use a thin Sharpie to mark the item.  This is the same but with rounded corners (so they curl less) and a dedicated white area that you can use a ballpoint to write on.  They are also much thicker, so they don't get bent.  If you buy the standard tape flags they are about 8 cents each, but the edges do curl after time.  These are about 30 cents each so if you really need something durable, this *might* be worth it.

0,What do you need me to explain? It's ink for certain brother printers. Works fine, packaged well and cost less then the big retailers. Why drive around or do several web searches for ink on several retailer sites? Just go to amazon.com type in cartridge number and presto, up pops the best ink selection you'll ever find. Forget trying the really cheap remanufactured inks you see everywhere, or the really cheap imported inks9usually in clear cartridge housing), been there my self. What a nightmare trying off brand cheap inks. One leak and the money you saved is wiped out as well as you printer. Genuine Brother inks can't be beat for quality printing at an affordable price. Thanks Brother fro a quality product and Amazon for quality service
0,My favorite pencil
0,Great product and prices and great service, and would buy again
0,Great for my needs! Is wonderful adhesive also!
0,Arrived quickly in a reinforced package.  These name badges are very professional-looking and very durable.  I order them for our large photo club and get many compliments from our members.  Names are easy to read and the tough but clear plastic cover keeps the badges clean and crisp.  Amazon is so much cheaper than local office supply stores. What's not to love???
0,Easy to use and a perfect size for purse or small area.  Plenty of space for all information.  I am vision impaired and can write large enough in it.
0,Works great and great piece of mind with a toddler running around. We purchased this in Dec 2012 and put new batteries in right away. The batteries are still working today (September 2014).		As others may have mentioned in the reviews, it is pretty easy to break into, but with a child so young in the house, there is no concern in the next 8 - 10 years that he will be able to get into it. It serves its purpose for now.
0,Good product. Just wish there were more long labels. Most of them are short.
0,Best. Pens. Ever.	As a nurse working in a facility with no EMR we do all the charting my hand. These are the only pens that i buy in bulk and try hard not to lose them. (If you're a nurse you know how quickly pens dissappear ) these are definitely my favorite.  Wish they lasted a little longer but im not complaining, the are great. Thinking about  just getting the refills.
0,I liked the original colors so much I had to order these too.
0,These mousepads are great for preventing carpal tunnel syndrome.  I like them so much that I bought them for all my employees over the years.  Now that I'm retired I'm still using them at home.
0,This fits fine in my standard office style tape dispenser and is plenty sticky.  I docked it a star because it's a bit yellow tinted which I don't care for but its pretty minor.  For the price, I'd consider buying again.
0,We replaced an older shredded with this model and are very pleased with the result.  The heavy duty power of this unit and the slide out bin are a real plus.  In addition, this is the quietest shredder I have ever been around.  You do need to be aware that they are serious about the 12 minutes of continuous run time.  When it approaches this time it can get hot and go into a cool down cycle that takes a while (20 minutes or so).  (Of course, if you are having to do a lot of that level of shredding you are likely getting ready to leave the country under an alias with only one small suitcase and you do not time to wait the 20 minutes.  In that case you might want to consider burning rather than shredding.
0,Reasonably fast and quiet. Toner for this printer is pretty cheap. Overall has a set of really useful features: laser, double sided printing, wireless.
0,Very satisfied with my order
0,My husband is a racquetball player and loves this Adhesive.  He sprays it on his handle and glove, and he says it greatly increases the control of his swing.
0,GREAT - LOVE THEM
0,Ever get tired of cheap pencils which mostly end up in the refuse end of the pencil sharper? These are a good price and great quality. The lead doesn't keep breaking off when young fingers push hard.
0,Just what I wanted, well made, holds a diameter like a compass should.  Shipping was fast, too.
0,Mind you, no one will use this white board to map out a project, draw a calendar of the next two months, or draw a map of the lower 48 states. But you WILL use this board for listing your grocery store items, hardware pickups and other random thoughts you need to capture. It is a great size and even includes a couple of magnets you can use to hold paper notes to.		The quality of the writing surface is good - it erases nicely without leaving a shadow (white board users know what I mean by this.) The hanging options are somewhat limited, but this means you can hold the board while moving it around the house and writing down your to-do list. Nice size, comes with a cool little dry erase pen which clips to the top of the board, and perfectly sized for daily use.
0,Knowing it is O. E. M. means that I know it will work perfectly in my printer.  I just don't trust reloaded cartridges.
0,I received these and they have done a good job
0,Love using these with flash cards for studying
0,I bought this to hold my work laptop (Lenovo T450, with docking station), and it works quite well. It's very sturdy, and doesn't move around on the desk. I'm using it at the tallest configuration.
0,So far I have had no issues with packages arriving damaged while using these, however they are see through.  If I enclose anything with writing that faces toward the envelope, you can see it through the envelope.  That was a little disappointing.
0,I use these every day.  Good product.
0,easy to use and only kind that fit my printer
0,Good quality - works well with my label maker.

0,I have been an HP for so long, its not even funny how much of a step up it has been. Everything that kodak sells as being its claim to fame is great(eg cheap ink, good photos) but i am so impressed with the kodak software, printer controls and drivers that came with this printer.
0,Extremely comfortable! I can sit at my desk for hours without my body getting stiff. I love this chair.
0,Very nice for the price.  I use this minimally at home for crafty things, and so far, it works very well.  I like the "self sharpening" feature.
0,Good pens.
0,I bought this primarily for the price!  It is a great buy for 100 sheets of photo paper.  I was hoping to print some large photos for framing and hanging on the wall, and needed large photo paper.  I like the 8.5x11 since it is easy to work with and fits the printer perfectly, it is hard to find a frame (other than document frame) for this paper, but I found a nice document one at Walmart that looks really nice (most photo frames are 8x10.  I put these in the printer (HP OfficeJet 8600), and printed my photos from iPhoto on my Mac, when I printed I selected HP Photo Paper for the paper type and hit print.  It took the printer about 2 minutes to print the entire page of full color (borderless), and for a test I ran my finger across the page, nothing came off and the paper was dry when it came out of the printer and there was no smearing (make sure you use proper settings or you might get smearing or wetness).  The print looked amazing and after framing it and hanging it, I am very happy!  Every printer is different, so be sure to make sure your printer supports photo paper and that you choose the right settings for photo paper when you print your document or image.  I highly recommend this and you can not find a better buy for Full size Photo Paper anywhere!!!
0,I purchased this to use with the white board calendar I purchased on here too.		These are great! Just slightly dampen with water and they erase everything!  I didn't have any ghosting. I use these anytime I need to erase the Expo dry erase markers.		Great product!
0,Very good . My mouse does not work good that has designs .this one is nice and smooth . Works great .
0,I agree with those who say this ink is better than that used for HP printers. It lasts much longer with no malfunction. For those who think these cartridges don't last very long, DON'T EVEN THINK about switching to HP. You'll have a stroke.
0,Had a smaller version for last few years and I am so glad I up scaled.  This is a nice unit and works great.
0,love it
0,GREAT PRODUCT. CHEAPEST ONLINE
0,Its ink.  Its Cyan colored and goes with the printer i am using so I am a victim.  I always buy the original because it just plain lasts longer.
0,This is a great alternative to the expensive toners put out by the manufacturers. I am on my second set and have had no issues.
0,I purchased this stand to replace the wobbly stand on my inexpensive, high resolution 27 inch monitor.		This stand comes with a lot of hardware for different installations and was easy to mount.		Now I'm able to rotate to portrait and of course the monitor no longer wobbles.		I'm happy that I got the discount price on this....Yet I think that I would have been happier if I purchased it 6 months ago at a higher price.		It works well for me.
0,work great, have used them for so many items already. Plus-a little bit of a brain teaser on how to fold together.
0,I read some of the reviews before picking up this item and honestly did not expect too much before I had a chance to use it. But now that I have and learned a couple of things I couldn't be more pleased with how it works. It feeds fast, is small and super easy to use. The XTRAVEL-SCAN150 delivers sharp, clear scans without much effort.		I went to the Xerox scanner website to download the latest drivers and get the One Touch software. Definitely need both to get the most out of the unit. Just go to the support page there, select the 150 and get the very latest for it. I installed on to a Windows 8.1 laptop with zero issues. You launch the driver install first. Then it will prompt you to plug in the scanner and finish that install. It will also prompt you to feed an alignment sheet into the scanner. I did that but after installing One Touch and doing a scan, it didn't look right so I aligned the scanner again. After that, perfect every time. So I would suggest definitely aligning the scanner a second time after you get your software ready.		At the default settings this scanner will do everything to PDF. But once you install One Touch, you can press the button on the scanner and bring up all the options you want to scan into any format that suits you. There is even a setting on it to kick the document back out if the slew on it is too far out of whack.		I scanned a variety of items. Drivers license, user manuals, photos. Each time the scanner performed flawlessly delivering razor sharp scans. Very surprising as I didn't expect the device to work anywhere close to how well it ended up. Just a couple more pieces of information before I close: The scanner needs to be aligned every so often to keep it going in top shape and they provide two calibration sheets to do that. It also should be cleaned every 30 or so scans. A piece of slightly thick, slightly rough paper is provided for that purpose.		Overall an excellent experience in a truly portable scanner. Sample for fair review.
0,perfect
0,everything was excellent
0,It's lead, um, good.
0,Perfect for my needs.  Needed for our business to keep receipts and job info for each job separate and hold all different types and sizes of receipts.  This makes the book keepers job easier and my job less of a hassle.  My only complaint would be they stick out of a regular size binder.
0,These are such cute notebooks! My almost 10yo daughter is into everything 'Paris,' after last years' American Girl Doll of the Year, Grace, and is always asking for paper and notebooks in which to contain all of her thoughts and ideas. The gold foiled accents and cute food themed drawings add whimsy and charm to the front of these journals. Each girl depicted on the front has a slightly different style and dog -- and did I mention these notebooks are CUTE?! It is hard to pick a favorite!		The covers of the journal are a heavier cardboard to resist bending. And, it is listed in the description, but in case you didn't read it: the title page is in SPANISH and PORTUGEUSE. This isn't a big deal -- you can figure out where to put your name, address, etc. The actual writing pages are free of any prompts or titles -- so no foreign language there.		Because they come in a 4-pack, my daughter wanted to share them with her 2 friends. The only problem was...she had a hard time picking which two to share and which two to keep!		Perfect for a girly girl to use as a diary or special school use. As the lining is college ruled, it may not be acceptable for some elementary work, but as a journal, they are really cute and exceeded my expectations!
0,I find the protracter a little hard to use.
0,I stuck this to the side of my refrigerator, and it is very handy. I would recommend it to anyone.
0,just what I need to  organize my frozen foods.
0,I am not new to fountain pens, although I would not consider myself an expert. I have restored a few Parker and Esterbrook pens and I would describe myself as someone who has discerning taste and high expectations from products, but do not really like the pretentious ones. Some of my pens are the Lamy 2000, the Pelikan M200, Lamy Safari, Parker 51, Parker Vacumatic, and more.		I say all this because this pen just blew me away, and not "for the money." When I buy a pen I try to forget how much it costs and judge it on it's own merits, although the price always tends to linger somewhere in the back of the mind. This pen is seriously amazing  a wet writer, whose nib is fabulously smooth and precise and ultimately one that I simply cannot put down. What's even more exciting to me is that it is $15 dollars. I would have happily paid twice if not 3 times more for a pen of this quality (and it writes that well) but somehow knowing that it cost $15 makes me so happy; I can throw it around, let it dry up, not feel self conscious about writing with an expensive pen and having to tell people how much it is worth the writing experience, blah blah blah.		I don't really have the time or the patience to write a full review on this pen and go into all the details but I will just say I felt incredibly compelled to share my excitement with everyone else about this jewel. My christmas shopping, it seems, will be very easy this year.		**Update**		It's been almost a year since I bought this pen and ever since I have used it almost exclusively. I think I may have put close to 3oz through it, filling it up everyday (I write a lot). I'm a little angry actually because I have a couple of hundred dollars worth of pens sitting in a case not really being used much. I'm even thinking about selling a few and simply buying 3 or 4 more of these so I can have a number of colors at hand. Now, writing with this pen and switching to another that costs $100 more will expose some of the nuances of a higher quality nib but I cannot stress enough how wonderfully this pen has been performing for me.
0,Use it for school and has been useful. Expands a bit do can fit more documents.
0,works perfect as they said
0,I have used these chemistry notebooks as everyday notebooks since being introduced to them many years ago in my chem lab at university.		Unfortunately, over the years this item has been more difficult to find (even my old university no longer sells them) and, when found, the pricing is outrageous.  It took some odd searching and multiple clicks to find it on Amazon.		Happy days again as I was on my last one!		Things I like:		- Rigid cover.	- Numbered, bound pages.	- Page size.		If you have a need for a notebook or journal, I highly recommend this product.
0,I use them to make My own Cards
0,Good for hiding medications so my loved one won't take too much.
0,Well made product and just what I wanted.
0,Great product, fast shipping.
0,I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local library, and I've tried all sorts of different organizers to store my cardstock, including two different brands of plastic tiers and a set of wire mesh baskets.  This 10-drawer cart with organizer top is by far the best of the lot.  The plastic drawers slide easily open and can hold half-a-ream (250 sheets) of cover stock (92 lb).  I no longer have to grope around under my computer to locate a particular color by touch.  See customer image for my fully-loaded cart (for some reason the photo is sideways).  The top of the cart has a set of shallow 'pockets' to hold miscellaneous craft items.		The cart came assembled except for the wheels, and they were easy to insert under the cart in pre-drilled holes.
0,Great product, worked as expected.
0,Great,
0,The thing about Avery labels is that they are THE BEST.		Besides being a great physical product, I love that I can use their online templates to print from my computers that don't have Microsoft Office. So slick!		These are great little ID labels that you can use as bookplates, for small marketing, or whatever else!
0,Great value for the amount u get.
0,On time. Meets expectation and needs.
0,Work great for mailing or covering small boxed items.
0,Does a nice job... I use it in all of my Jinhao pens.
0,Good quality for the money and less expensive than you'll find at office supply stores. I wish they had rubber on the bottoms to prevent scratching my shelves, but they're still fine.
0,Works as promised.  Thanks so much!
0,I used this for reports and term papers. This cartridge lasted MUCH longer than I expected it to with me printing so many sheets each day. good price too!
0,I love these pencils, would definitely recommend.
0,I am in love with these rings!  These are the perfect size for storing 3-4 washi tape, I now have mine organized by color, what I want to use for the month, and my favorites.  I have magnets on the side of my metal cart and I can easily grab them.
0,Most of the pens are really bright and beautiful, there were only a couple of them that came dried out. Even still you get a lot of good pens for the price.
0,Great item.  They last a long time and the colors are nice and bright.  The eraser on the cap is a nice perk!
0,And these are usually out of stock at hobby stores, so thought I'd order here and save myself the drive and frustration.
0,The price was right and there is enough space in each day section to actually put a more detailed description and phone number.
0,Great colors
0,This ink is such a beautiful color. It is deep and pigmented. It is thin and easily usable in a fountain pen. (Pilot fine nib) The color is reddish orangish brown. Very beautiful and unique. Additionally, the jar is huge. 3 oz. of ink is a lot of ink!
0,as described
0,A little goes a long way with this product. It will last you forever. It has a great smell and left my hair feeling silky. Reduced the amount of frizz and looked great after flat ironing it.
0,These are the best gel markers I have ever used..They do not bleed thru the pages...
0,Love these highlighters, but they run out of ink very quickly compared not only to other sharpie highlighters, but other highlighter brands as well.
0,nice
0,Two months into ownership and it has been trouble free. Still on the included ink, a good sign. Took longer for setup than I had anticipated. Good print quality in color and b&w. This Officejet was a replacement for another printer that was always troublesome, consumed ink cartridges rapidly, and lasted only for one month past warranty.
0,This works perfect for planning out my weekly meals.  I use it generally just for supper, as this seems to be the most challenging meal in our house to try and figure out.  After a long day at work/school/daycare, it seems nobody in our family can decide on what to eat.  I sit down and figure it out a couple weeks ahead at a time.  It takes the stress out of figuring out supper meals!  And I love the detachable shopping list on the side.  As I'm figuring out the menu for a particular week, I can quickly jot down the items needed for meals.
0,Great product, great price!
0,exactly as described and arrived shortly
0,The stapler works very easily, with just a single finger push. I use heavy duty staples, so it goes through 20 pages effortlessly.
0,I find it hard to read without this. Also helps with finding me way back
0,Great price and OEM labels.
0,I got it on a whim because I figured that I do garage sale enough and sometimes fundraising (once in a great moon) that it would be useful to have. And so far I found that it is. It's also useful when you are teaching kids about money (not to be harsh about kid toys made for that reason), but it seems to help kids out--in my opinion--better than the those fake cash registers do...but then again that might be because I don't use fake money when teaching a kid about it. You'd be surprised how much a kid learns with only 1 of each bill ranging from $1-$20 and a whole bunch of change. Anyway, it serves it's purpose and is pretty durable. I would definitely recommend this product for use.
0,Good stuff...Lamy is a german company who make GREAT products!
0,Exactly what I needed. The mat came well packed and it was less expensive than at the nearby office supply store.		Interestingly, it came with instructions on how to unroll it and flatten it; particularly useful when the package had been sitting out in the cold and practically frozen. The only drawback is the requirement to keep it at 72 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours (72+) to unroll it an flatten it. We don't keep our home that warm in February. I managed to get it (almost) flat at a much lower temperature without cracking it; there is only one curve that remains near the back edge; I trust it will disappear when the weather warms up.
0,great pens.  I love BIC products and I use all their pens.  I never tried these.  They have a nice smooth stroke to them.  They feel great in the hand.  These are fine point, which I like to use for writing checks, letters etc.  There no skipping or blobs of ink, just a nice pen.
0,Convenient and easy to use
0,I use this to stand and work off of my MacBook Pro.  Height is adjustable.  Very sturdy.  I love it!
0,I was looking for a paper I had put away somewhere and was surprised and happy when I found it neatly tucked into the divider. These are quite nice and work if you use them!
0,The perfect weight paper.  GREAT PRICE!
0,Arrived well packaged and looked like a real company sent it, not one of those weird, nondescript, blank boxes that looked packaged by a 5 year old. Popped it right in and had no problems. That was a few weeks ago and everything is working fine. I'm using it in a light office environment. It's a good buy, definitely saved some money with this.
0,I splurged a little in my moving boxes this year and bought these instead of going through the process of saving ALL my boxes and stealing boxes and having mismatched-sized boxes, and I'm glad I did.		These are very easy to put together, which makes me happy because it seems that it will be easy to store them unfolded in a closet for future use. The handles in the boxes are with two pieces of cardboard (because of how you fold it) so the boxes are extremely sturdy. The lids are easy to put together and fit on great.		I appreciate that there is plenty of space for me to write exactly whats in the box. I have been doing this with a brown marker and its been working great. I have about 8 of them packed already and just appreciate that I can stack them all simply on top of each other because they are all the same size.		One box I have is completely filled with textbooks. It hasn't messed with the integrity of the box at all and because its the small size, I can still lift the box easily.		I love this product. The only reason I won't be buying it again is because, while it says Prime, they won't ship for 2-4 weeks (I'm assuming because they are out of stock) and I need them in the next week and a half. That said, I just moved up to the medium in the same brand because I liked these boxes so much.
0,Great product and service
0,Got them for my daughter for school - they look and work great like a pencil should!
0,kinda small but they work so far
0,Works well.  I am interested to see how long it last.... Am happy wth it!
0,Quick background:		A local "big box store" ran a special on the Samsung M2830DW printer at a price that was simply too good to pass up.  I've recently acquired a Samsung Chromebook to play with and have set up two printers on Google Print - a Kodak Hero 7.1 inkjet and an ancient HP 4050N laser printer.  The Kodak is a bit expensive to print to and the HP requires a local computer (on the same LAN) be powered up to direct Cloud print jobs.  I wanted a relatively cheap-per-page laser printer that would not require an attending computer.  The Samsung fills the bill nicely.		Setup was quite simple - although I did have to use a USB cable (included in the box) to set up the initial wireless connection.  Oddly there is a "no cable" option on the setup DVD menu but it was grayed out.  Rather than fuss with it I simply used the USB cable to set things up and then removed the cable when the wireless connection was completed.  Setup took less than 15 minutes, much of which was spent removing all of the packing tape and materials and getting the cartridge ready.  The pull-tape on the cartridge did, as noted by other reviewers, generate a small puff of toner when removed from the cartridge.  However since I had been forewarned (thanks, gang!) I pulled the tape over a waste basket and things were fine.		My home network has several computers attached to it and I've set the printer up on a PowerSpec desktop (Windows 8.1), an Asus laptop (Windows 8.1), and a Dell tablet (Windows 8.1) along with the aforementioned Samsung Chromebook.  I only used the install DVD on the desktop to set up the printer; all others were set up by simply scanning the network using Windows Control Panel / Devices and Printers / Add New Printer.  Drivers were no issue - they were found in Windows 8.1 without resorting to a "Windows Update" search.		The printer has worked flawlessly (I concede that it's been in operation for less than 48 hours but of course having a new toy requires a thorough workout).  It is faster than either the Kodak or the HP and the print quality just barely edges out the heavy duty HP.  Duplex printing is an absolute snap.  Cloud printing works quite well and the Chromebook prints to it as readily as it did the HP or the Kodak.  (Caveat - I have not yet tested envelopes; I print perhaps 2 envelopes a month at present and won't need Cloud Printing to do that so it's not a priority for me).		Image printing is quite nice - I printed out some network diagrams and the various bits and pieces of the network came out crisp and clear, using standard "inkjet/laser/copier" no brand paper.  I also printed out some screen shots of various info boxes, web pages, etc., and I've been quite pleased with the results.		Of course the cost-per-page will be less than the Kodak (even though Kodak ink isn't terribly dear, it's still an inkjet and the cartridges don't last too very long).  The HP, being designed as an office workhorse, might be less per page - but requires more electricity to operate and also requires that the attending computer be powered up constantly in order to Cloud print.  From what I have gathered there is at least one suitable non-OEM cartridge available for the Samsung that gets excellent reviews.		The Samsung seems to be a nice compromise.		Pros:		Easy setup (unbox, untape, load the toner (don't forget to shake it!!!), plug it in, wait for it to cycle, put the setup DVD in your computer and Bob's-Yer_Uncle.  You may need, as noted, to also connect via the (included) USB cable for setup.		Google Print works quite well.		(In my case - purchase price.  It was on a limited special ("door buster") and we literally paid more for the no-name crockpot sitting on our kitchen counter).		Cons:		The power cord seems quite short, shorter than the ones going to my other printers or computers.  It is a standard power cord, however, and so a longer one is easily purchased should one find oneself in that predicament.		Although it's "early days" yet so far the Samsung works as advertised and I'm more than a little pleased.		Regards,		Jim

0,Neat little gift for my son. It's kinda flimsy and super lightweight but he gets a kick out of it anyway.

0,The monitor lift seems to be very sturdy, and stands like a rock. My 19" monitor stands on it nicely, and I can see it much better now it is higher. A note to those with progressive glasses like me - I needed a couple of days to adjust to the monitor height because of the limited viewing area on the glasses for each particular distance. After that I didn't have any problems seeing and really like the new monitor position.
0,didn't realize I had so many cards, but majority, sear could be 50 cards fit.  Doesn't take up much room.  I think I will order another one.
0,Very good results with product received.
0,Great for arts and crafts, scrapbooking and school projects. I love these because it's not messy and if you keep the cap on tightly these do not dry out. This glue bonds very well and its simple to use.		These glue sticks are usually super cheap in the stores around back to school time, so I make sure I stock up on them!
0,I did not have any issues with the scale. It was very accurate and agreed with the scale at my local Post Office. You can use either batteries or the plug in adapter to power the unit. Because I use it in several locations I chose batteries. I especially like the back-lit readout and the fact that it has a very large bed on which to place the package to be weighed.
0,as expected
0,these gel pens are my favorite. the sparkle has such an awesome effect.
0,Ink cartridges arrived broken and unusable.		After working with GPC, replacement cartridges were sent that arrived in working order.  Cartridges installed a nd working flawlessly.  Thank you GPC.
0,If you are an adult, or have larger hands, then this pencil may not be for you. (hence the "Kid's" in the product name). The 1.3mm sized lead takes getting used to if you are used to 0.5 or 0.7mm lead sizes. The pencil itself is fairly basic. Made in China and easy for kids to use. An ideal pencil for young writers. Recommended for kid's. Comes with extra lead and some stickers. Typical BIC no-frills quality. Recommended.
0,great color, very happy with the service.
0,Technology is awesome, but also can be used for nefarious purposes.  One of the scariest tactics identity thieves are now using is obtaining an RFID reader and stealing your credit card information ... without even having to taking your wallet or purse and removing the card.  Many of us may have heard of this technology and simply don't know how to protect ourselves.  It's really quite easy.  Take each one of your credit cards or passport and wrap them up in aluminum foil.  Easy peasey, but quite impractical.		Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is being transmitted continually through our credit cards, gas cards, and the like.  I don't care if someone knows all about my habits at Subway, but I do care if they are overly interested in my credit cards.  I know only one person who had her identity stolen and according to her, she was still dealing with the problem years later.		I put each one of my credit cards in these RFID blocking envelopes.  They went in easily, but also came out easily.  They were easy to remove, but didn't fall out.  I have more than my share of cards so the added bulk wasn't problematic.  I  watched an electronic pickpocking demonstration video from Fox News online and everyone who was targeted was shocked when their information was put in front of them.  No thanks, I'd rather be proactive and keep my identity and my credit cards intact.		Sample provided for review.
0,Just wish I had a better printer to make up nice name tags.
0,Set it up with my android and I print off my phone, how cool is that?
0,What a neat product for "lefties"!  Bought this for a left-handed relative as a gift.  She said she really appreciated us thinking of her, and that she's loving it - good product and service.
0,I got his one for myself in time for Christmas this year as a gift to upgrade my existing older cordless set at work. It is very clear with 2 lines and a corded handset. I will update once its setup but it love the color scheme and it feels important.
0,I received these markers a couple days ago, and tried them out on Creative Haven's In Full Bloom (coloring book).  The range colors is the best I have found in marker sets. The ink flows easily from each color I used, and they do not spread the way some Sharpie colors do.  The fold-out packaging is nifty, allowing the markers to be spread out in front of me, each in their own little "garage".  I like the small bin in the center to keep the colors in use together.		My new favorite markers!
0,I love this mouse pad. The image on the front is beautiful, and the pad is very nice and just the right thickness. Altogether it is the perfect combination of form and function. I would definitely recommend this product.
0,I bought this pencil sharpener for a very unusual reason.  Three times a year I send school supplies to a young Ugandan orphan man who distributes them to the orphans in the government schools over there.  The government schools do not supply pencils and pens and school supplies.  By sharpening the pencils they are no longer new and can be sent for less.  They are also ready to use when they arrive making that dilemma simpler for the student receiving them.  So I grind away on this and sharpen all the pencils before they are mailed. I tried an electric and found it not as good although it was faster and not so labor intensive.  Guess what?  The batteries run out.  The leads get stuck and you have to empty it more often.  My vote goes for the X-Acto for practicality and length of use.
0,Great set of colored pencils. Prismacolor makes the best pencils I've ever used, and this is a nice set, has good variety of colors without having to break the bank to get the full set.
0,good product, fast shipping
0,Just what we needed to tackle Algebra and Geometry this school year.
0,Amazon sent me a note saying that I have to explain what Sharpies are, in order to post a review. So here you go: Sharpies are permanent markers that work great on all kinds of things from boxes to writing on plastic. They are the best markers.		Now that's out of the way: what was great here is that they were $0.60 each in this pack when I ordered it, and arrived in 2 days with Prime shipping. That is a great value, about 1/3 of the cost in my local office supply store. Perfect! Note that the price appears to fluctuate and is more now than when I ordered. But it's still a bargain for Sharpies.
0,Great pen
0,Very pleased with product
0,Love my sharpies
0,This is a good planner that was inexpensive.
0,Nice colors and high quality pens that make a nice neat line. My daughter loves drawing with these! She's been using them regularly for 3 weeks now and they are still going strong.
0,Kicks butt! Great product.
0,This works fine. Its been hard to get my nephew to use it. His mother dident get him very interested in reading and hes to spoiled with game boys to want to read. Some of the books seem cool and I don't mind buying them despite the price but he dosent seem that into it. So Ill keep trying other things.
0,These erasers are great! They're very thick and durable so they get a lot of use. I've bought other erasers that tear almost immediately.	These erase really well and don't leave marks behind. They're also a great value for how many you get per box
0,I bought two of these binders along with the Avery Mini Heavyweight Sheet Protectors. The first one I use to store programs from plays/musicals that I have collected over the years. They fit perfectly in the sheet protectors and this binder can hold a lot. I also bought one to store my craft dies and stamps. Works very well for both. I will definitely buy another if these run out of space.
0,Why the inflated cost? It's much less expensive to just buy the packs of actual mechanical pencils. Depending on the amount of mechanical pencils you purchase in a pack, each pencil comes with 3 pieces of lead, and they come with a refill container with 12 extra pieces of lead AND 5 erasers for free! Almost 1/3 less expensive. My question is-why is it more affordable to continue buying and polluting the world with pencils you might not need, instead of just the lead and eraser refills?
0,Great
0,This box will last you a long time. Great for packing dishes or other flat glassware!
0,I like them.
0,Yes you can buy a bic 4-color pen for under $3. I did and it ended up costing me more money.  Why I didn't just take the first hint from bic I don't know.  My first bic pen leaked, all of a sudden the green ink blotted up.  When I grabbed it out of my pants pocket it got all over my hands.  The replacement bic I wasn't so lucky as it leaked inside my white shirt pocket.  This time the blue leaked and it wasn't pretty.  This time I thought there has to be something better.  I bought the pentel rolly 4 color.  I received it broken.  I still kept it I really didn't care if it had a clip or not.  Well, the pen wrote horrible.  You had to work it just to write.  Colors were not vivid, wrote scratchy.  I looked again and that is when I saw it, the Uni-ball Jetsream 4&1.  $16.50 I thought was  more than I wanted to spend but hey I was out of choices and look how much I spent on the cheap ones.  I even ended up ruining a good shirt.  I received it in good condition, colors are vivid, the ink just glides across the paper, the color mechanisms are nice and easy to use, nice feel to the pen, and a great balance.  I am very happy with this purchase.  I am going to buy a couple more to use around the house and in my office.  Do yourself a favor spend a little more.
0,I got this piece as an addition to my exhibit of 20th century gadgets no longer in use. To display for my nieces and nephew's who want to know what a cord on the phone is used for.
0,Excellent paper for the $.
0,I've been using the plain off-white clips and they've served their purpose but for my birthday when I hung my birthday cards, I loved the added color!
0,Great tape for a good price. Came on time.
0,One thing I like about Paper Mate pens is that they have sleek lines and are not only a pleasure to write with, but they look good. Even though this pen has a slightly wider bottom, it is still very comfortable to write with. I am not a fan of the rubberized and extra padded grip so many pens have now, as if they are kindergarten crayons for kids who are not quite comfortable with their fine motor skills yet. I was so sad when Paper Mate stopped making the ball point that had the same form as the Flair markers. Those were the best. These InkJoy 550RTs are not at all bad -- the fine point version leaves a smooth and easy to read line. I like retractables but have given up on refilling pens -- that really is old school, so disposable is the way to go and these are an excellent choice for anyone needing to write a lot.
0,Works well with the Canon printers for a fraction of the cost. Printer ink should not cost a fortune, hence I will continue to buy this brand.
0,good
0,Works Great!
0,The best watercolor pencils I have ever used! I love these so much! They are bright and vivid and absolutely stunning to work with. The color payoff is unlike any other in the watercolor category.
0,Good ink for my Epson printer.
0,The easiest to use, it removes color as well as anything else I have tried
0,as advertised
0,used them on both my cars. nice!
0,Distinctive design that collapses well and writes well.  It's a great addition to the collection of a pen freak, like me.
0,Great paper for my dissertation!  I was pleased with the quick delivery since I was working on a deadline.  It printed perfectly on my lazer printer--no problems at all.
0,use all the time.
0,Paper quality is good. It prints up nicely in my HP desktop printer. No streaking or smearing after printing. We ordered two of these so we'd have a back up. Great price too....cheaper then target! Will re-order when we run out again.
0,Good quality. 10x13 is right size for my office use. The quality is not cheap. It  is the one that I need.
0,I love these dividers! They are of excellent quality! While the package doesn't mention how thick they are (in terms of mil), they are very strong and durable. I'm using them for writing up a family trust, and I have confidence that they will keep my papers very safe and protected while they make the rounds of notaries, attorneys and family members. The size is nice and big, which makes the end tabs very readable. I will not be using a binder, I'll put brass brads in the holes instead since our documents have to fit inside a small safe deposit box. You really can't go wrong with these dividers and they would be ideal for school or work projects as well. I intend to get more for my taxes, so my accountant will have an easier time going through our business papers. Highly recommended!
0,very snug in my wallet not sure these work but what the heck
0,Great product for an on-the-go sales person. Excellent quality printing... documents and photos.
0,Beautiful colors and easy to use with my Canon MG7520 printer!...Thanks much!!
0,This paper cutter replaced an old cheap plastic one. It is so much better! It worked very well for making coupons for my business.	If you need absolutely perfect cuts and alignment buy a more expensive cutter. I think this one would meet most peoples needs.	I have noticed some people comment about the alignment guide angling when tightened. I found that if I tightened it very lightly it stayed straight and did not move in use. If you tighten it all the way it does angle.
0,OK
0,My favorite pens! I use them every day!
0,Great price for the bulk amount. Served my needs for my job.
0,Love the different colors and they work and last very well!
0,It seems more and more like we need color inkjet printers, and the more and more we need them, the more we also need those cartridges too. The HP color inkjet cartridge #22 is a essential key for people who are into the HP deskjet 3900 series. The cartridges are very convient, and easy to setup into your inkjet printer. It not just prints well in color, it also prints nicely in black and white, for those who've run out of ink in their black and white inkjet cartridge. I like this a whole lot because it is convient and affordable.		Price: B		Overall: B
0,Great product - with the best price you can find (these folders are EXPENSIVE).
0,I am a planner junky.  I spend a significant amount of time looking for the perfect planner for the school year (I'm a teacher).  This one is one of the best I've come across.  A planner has to be functional and allow me to use whatever kind of pen I want.  This one does.  The problem with most planners on the market is that the paper is very thin.  Many times ballpoint pens can be seen through the pages.  This one has pretty heavy duty paper.  I am using the Staedtler pens and also the Pilot G-2 gel pens and neither has bled through the page or is remotely visible on the next page.  This is a big win for me.  This planner is thick as it is 18 months.  My only complaint is the cover.  I have already developed several air bubbles from the laminating.  I did purchase replacement covers from Hobby Lobby.  This bugs me quite a bit.  I wish there was some sort of "poly" cover available as that would solve this problem.
0,This shredder is great. I bought this a while ago and am very pleased with it. I haven't had any problems and it shreds perfectly. The one thing I don't like about it is that you can't shred more than a few sheets at a time but if you don't have a lot of paper to shred this is perfect. It is not too noisy and shreds paper into micro-cuts which I like for identity theft purposes. At first it was a little difficult to put the papers in the slot but once I got the right angle I had no problem. I recommend  this Amazon shredder highly.
0,We've Been Using these for about 8 years and they are excellent. There are no printier jams with them nd they're easy to handle.
0,This lasted a long time in my school.
0,just what we needed
0,Originally started using Super Quink when I was studying calligraphy back in 1975.  It was then and remains today to be one of the more superior inks available.  Spreads smoothly, doesn't gum up pens or nibs and has an excellent opaque quality.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
0,Thank you from Vast Array Corporation!
0,as advertised works well
0,Absolutely the best pencil  sharpener I have ever owned. Does a fantastic job with colored pencils, perfect point. Would give it 6 stars if I could!
0,I'm a leather crafter and these are a MUST have for holding glued pieces together.
0,Just as described, works well and was bought at good value! Thanks.
0,This product is worth the small but extra cost when compared to traditional ruled paper. The quality of the paper is better than the regular stuff you can purchase where most people buy their back to school supplies. This is especially helpful for students in middle and high school, as they should learn to keep all assignments until grades are finalized. The reinforced holes keep papers from falling out of the binder and keep things neat and tidy. This works for me and my 13 year old nephew who used to have a binder that looked like all his papers were trying to escape (seriously 2/3rds had broken holes).		I know prices fluctuate on Amazon, but I should mention that when I purchased it as an add-on item, it was cheaper than all the local stores during back-to-school sales in August.
0,Nice reliable ink. The tip permits ease of application on stamp pads.
0,Can be written on with pen, Sharpie, or with the ink from the printer. The surface of the labels themselves is an off-white textured feeling surface, and looks very pretty. I was able to get the sticky part to adhere to old spice jars that had paper labels on them. I haven't been able to do that with other brands of stickers, so this is very good for me to know. Now I can re-use the spice jars with labels on them, and know what it is I'm reaching for in the spice cabinet.		The paper itself is of a sturdier material than the typical labels that you use for mailing labels and the like. My printer complained a little at having more than one of these fed through the tray at one time. Your printer may have different results. However, as labels go overall, these are excellent little things to have around.
0,Nice quality and excellent price for regular home use. Probably not great if doing lots of photos or large graphics requiring lots of ink.
0,Good Product, I Will Buy It Again Soon.
0,It's hard to review paper but this came quickly.  It's not cheaply made and it does not get stuck in the copier.
0,Bought as a gift for someone who loves pink (she loved it).  It has a strong clasp which can be locked if wanted.  Seems sturdy enough for keeping the larger file cards in.
0,All these cheap phones today have nothing in their base so when you grab the phone you pull the base off the desk or table.  This is the classic ATT phone with a nice heavy base and a design that still looks great today.  The black is perfect for the home office and the white for a nighstand or kitchen.
0,Excellent rubber bands for the MTN!
0,Very high quality, looks great and comes with all the hardware you need to hang it or fasten it to a wall. I was impressed for the price. It's in my classroom and is holding up well. Terrific space saver.
0,rec'd as advertised
0,This was my first time buying this brand so I was nervous. I was completely out of my normal brand (Tombow Extreme) and the price for replacing is was insanely high here so I decided to take a risk. Im very pleased with this super strong tape runner. Its definitely my new favorite. It glides right out and it never jams up. No quick flicking required. I love that! Im happy to have found a new favorite at a much lower price. Its a win, WIN!
0,very economical quality paper
0,A+++
0,These are the best!  I use these for homeschooling on our laminated sheets.  These don't smudge when the kids use them and we love them!  Great color options too.
0,like them
0,Gave this as a gift for my son for Christmas.  He loved it!
0,Comparabloe price - love this brand
0,This binder is very durable.
0,Nice quality.
0,Great trimmer - when use it to cut labels - so far we have used to cut 6 sheets at a time.  Saves time
0,Always useful and attractive, keeps my binder organized.
0,perfect - not too big, not too small.  JUST RIGHT
0,Very solid, heavy. No stapling issues to date, I buy swingline staples....
0,Its big enough for all the things I need to put on it. It is highly visible so my coworkers know what I am doing when I am not in the office. And my favorite part is when I am stuck on the phone with a chatterbox, I can color in flowers and paisley between my "uh-huh" and "okay".
0,Excellent value!
0,These are my favorite pens to write with. Classic.
0,I used this to transfer a design to a skateboard before painting it. Worked out great. And I get the idea it would do well on most surfaces...
0,Purchased as a gift for son's new gaming computer. Really nice quality, thick, and seems durable. Great that it covers such a huge area. The red trim goes with the lights on his computer.  He really likes it. Highly recommended.
0,AS DESCRIBED!!!!!!!!!
0,A great classic, but needs to include business card holders for lazy people.
0,I like this Scanner because not only does it look good it works great!
0,These are my new favorite pens.		They're cheap, comfortable, refillable, retractable...  And they're purple.  Well, "violet".		I like to use a distinctive ink color in my notes and paperwork so that it's easy to tell mine from others.  I've had a habit of using purple ink for years now.  The problem is that purple ink isn't widely available, which means I've had to make-do with some unimpressive pens.		I'm very happy with these though.  The grip is very comfortable.  The pens seem well-constructed.  They're readily available both here on Amazon as well as at my local Staples.  And they're refillable.		The ink is a bright, vibrant violet.  Somewhere between purple and pink.  They write very smoothly, and I've seen absolutely no indication of fading.
0,keeps my important documents clean and wrinkle free. also keeps them from oxidizing over time.
0,This is great smooth writing/drawing lead, one of my favorites. It does seem to be a touch softer than most HB.
0,Seriously my favorite notebook! I love the inserts it comes with and I get one for each class. It has a little pocket for index cards and I usually write the name of the class on that. I have used these notebooks since high school and now in college. I love that I can rearrange, add, and remove papers. Along with a hole puncher, these are a school staple for me.
0,exactly what I was looking for
0,Works great, I order these every time someone in my department needs one.
0,I did not receive a discount.  I have only inserted one yellow cartridge and printed a test page.  Cartridge was immediately accepted with no error message and ink level immediately showed full.  Print quality test page looked good.  Cartridge is transparent so you can see the ink in the tank.  You do have to push with much more force to insert cartridge because FUZOO uses a plastic film over the ink nozzle whereas Brother uses a removeable clip.  I removed the yellow tag that said to remove it but did not remove the ink nozzle film since there are no indications that it should be removed.  If problems occur later, I will update this review.	3-13-17  Still no problems.  No ink nozzle clogs.  Good print quality.		TIPS:  Do not remove the plastic film from the cartridge nozzle.  Do not turn the Brother printer off EVER!  Just let it go to sleep.  Then it will automatically wake up and clean nozzles as needed.
0,good
0,Great idea - Sturdy and rigid		Great for moving and packing light fragile items like: dishes, glasses, and linens.		They can be used after the move for continuous storage or seasonal items.		They are large and heavy, be warned do not fill them up with heavier items.		They arrived flat, upon unfolding them the ends didn't align; they were off by an inch.
0,I wish I would have bought more of these terrific notebooks when they were in stock.  I've used many different premium brands, and frankly, these are as good if not better in some cases.  I haven't been able to find a better value in such a well constructed journal.  They take ink well and I haven't noticed bleed through or feathering, but I'm also not using heavy pressure or overly wet inks.  There is slight ghosting, but it's not terrible.  The cover is durable, vibrant and constructed nicely.  The back pocket is roomy and sturdy.  The pages are smooth and a medium weight that's a little heavier than copy paper.  The dots are even and line up across pages.  The pages are sewn and lay flat.  The ribbon marker is adequate in length and the elastic closure feels secure.  I was surprised I liked it better than a similarly sized Rhodiarama that was more than twice the price.  I would NOT be embarrassed to gift this item and would be happy to receive more in different colors.  Great for journaling, recipes, jottings, doodles or whatever else your heart desires.  The PU cover can be personalized with paints, stickers or ???, but are beautiful just the way they are.
0,I read the measurements before purchasing this pack but was still shocked when it arrived. These rolls are huge! We have a dispenser and needed refills for packing and moving and just figure these were the most reasonably priced that would fit our specific tape gun (Duck brand standard tape gun). These rolls are HUGE and it's a pack of 6 so....I'm pretty sure it'll get us through our next three moves.
0,What a fabulous laser-jet for personal or small business use.  It's everything I wanted it to be: compact, the toner lasts and the copies are sharp.  Won't smudge when you highlight.
0,Great for price
0,Recommend you only use genuine ink!
0,Now this is fun...good objects - you can really make some "classy" art (coloring projects)
0,24 of these highlighter should help students of all ages for years. The colors are bright but you can easily read through them, having six colors allows you to also organize information by color category which I recall doing many times through High School and College. There is no scent to these at all that I could find and that has been a problem with highlighter pens in the past. You can use highlighters for coloring as well as marking text so those out there who do adult coloring, these might be a useful option for you, too.		However you should be able to use these pens for fine lines and for thick ones but I found that the finer edge didn't have as much ink and didn't make the same quality of marks as when I used the flat head. That was disappointing because sometimes what you want to highlight is narrow not wide.
0,This caddy comes with 24 scissors. The scissors would fall into the 3 - 6 year old category. They aren't a completely blunt tip, but won't do heavy duty cutting.	They fit nicely in the caddy and don't fall out when being spun. It was a little disappointing that there were no left handed scissors - you would think they could throw in a couple pair. Unfortunately, left handed scissors are hard to come by.	But, to get a good lot of scissors for an entire class or coop - this is a good deal.	The caddy is sturdy and can handle kids curiosity to see it spin around. I actually took out some of the scissors and put pencils and colored pencils in a couple of the cups allowing it to fit in the center of our table and be multipurpose.	Overall a good product.
0,I have been using these daily now for my normal use. Had originally planned to color with them,  but I really like how they flow for writing purposes.  Thin enough to allow me to write small font size and keep writing neat, but not scritchy or skippy how some finer point pens can be to write with.
0,Love Love Love!  this little super helper!!  What a great product.  Especially with holiday cards.  But I use it all year round.  I keep it upside down & tightly closed in one of those desk organizers right within reach.  And the one I have now, I've had for quite some time.  They last a long time as long as you close the lid tightly.  And I like to keep mine upside down.  Great value for your money.
0,Works great.  Matched the one I was replacing on my RCA phone.  Thanks a lot!
0,I really love these scissors, so I just want to get the reason it's 4 stars out of the way right now. When I ordered them it said free shipping, but once I put in my Alaskan address the shipping was nearly $30.00 which is completely outrageous. Nevertheless, I needed them and purchased them. Aside from the fact they were very expensive, I am very happy with them. They are very durable and very kid-friendly. The blunt ends are great for young 'uns. And the light-weight plastic handles are perfect for even the smallest hands. I love that they can be used for either right or left handed children. And I adore that they come with a little plastic container that keeps them all neatly aligned. I use it and have taught the kids how to nicely put their scissors back in place. I love it and would highly suggest it for teachers, camp counselors, and parents of large families.		Tips:	These scissors are great for paper, string, yarn, and some fabrics. They don't work well on cardboard, fleece material, or plastic packages.	The plastic handles are great because they are so easy to clean. Just wipe them off with a wet papertowel and virtually all marks disappear.
0,Seems to be working fine with printer.
0,The retractable highlighters are phenomenal. They don't bleed through the paper and they haven't dried out.
0,EXCELLENT FOR THE PRICE.
0,Self adhesive makes these easy to use and lick free.
0,usefull
0,Very clear with good gripping power and good thickness.
0,Fit printer, works well
0,Keeps the mouse clean.
0,I love this binder. The easy-open tab is so awesome. It actually saves so much time believe it or not! It has this nice rubbery feel and the binder is strong and sturdy. Buy it!
0,good quality and good product
0,These envelopes exceed my basic standards for secured envelopes, but not enough to give them 5 stars simply because when held up against daylight, the internal writing and typing can be deciphered with modest needs.  Otherwise, the paper is strong enough to withstand most postal handling.  Best of all the glue or adhesive is about as good as I have used.  Many brands of envelopes use insufficient glue to seal the envelope completely and sooner or later that will create a problem.
0,These are good mailers and come at a good value.  I use alot of these for my business so glad to find a product that doesn't break the bank.
0,OK
0,I wanted a slim case to put in one of the pockets of my coupon organizer, it works great.  Perfect for my needs.
0,I use my print head every day for my daily copies that I make. The quality of the copies are great and easy to use. I sometimes will use re-manufactured ink cartridges, but prefer the name brand print heads for my personal use.
0,They're binders. Not much to expect. Very durable and they do what I need them to do. The rings are easy to open and close and they aren't loose. I've had binders in the past that weren't put together well and the ring mechanism would start to get loose. My box came with blue, pink, green, and purple in it. The colors were very vibrant and pretty. If I'm going to suffer in college, I want to do it colorfully.
0,For my boyfriend -- he loves the G2 pens and I am so happy we can get the refills!
0,BEST DEAL!!!
0,Sweet, but not too cutesy. Well-made and sturdy. Quality card.
0,I love this phone.  Since I don't need a 2-line phone any longer I bought this while they were on sale.  Setup went smoothly and pairing with 2 cell phones and a headset worked great.  One thing I was happy they put in was a mute button.  Another big plus is they are using standard AAA batteries instead of those stupid battery packs.  They take up less footprint than the older system I have. Haven't really checked out the answering system since I paired this with an OOMA.  Panasonic got it right on this phone.
0,Great product would purchase again
0,My new toner choice. No issues with toner spots or lines. All I want is clean, dependable toner. I hope the quality remains consistent from purchase to purchase.
0,Love the weight and the large tabs.  Excellent
0,We are satisfied with these mini binders.
0,For a basic laser printer this is great. We have even gotten used to not having color. Love the fact that you can change to 2 sided printing under preferences if you need to when you print something. We do not print alot so this compact little unit is great for our needs. Envelopes and labels require extra effort with having to open both the front and the back unlike the HP Photosmart. We got this since our HP Photosmart stopped printing black. We still need to keep it for the scanning, though.
0,Great deal, excellent product, valued Seller, highly recommended A++
0,thanks - good product - durable and strong
0,great product
0,This is still going strong.  I won't be ordering the name brand again.
0,Love the variety of color ink and pen feels really good and balanced. Will have to buy a couple more for gifts or just for me.
0,Exactly what I needed!
0,This is a nice product. It performs perfectly and prevents you from making a mess! I wish I had one of these years ago!
0,They're red pens! No complaints! I don't know what else to say except their only flaw is they don't write by themselves.
0,good
0,I use these all the time and they are great. The weight is not too heavy nor too light.
0,I bought this as a gift. My feedback has been wonderful. She loves it, loves being able to just pull one off with one hand and start writing. And it's incredibly cute. It's weighted so it doesn't lift off of the table. It's just fantastic!
0,I have been well pleased with the compatible HP 49A toner cartridges.  This was no exception.  This cartridge fits the HP LaserJet 1160Le which is an great desk top printer.
0,THANK YOU
0,OK
0,Came already together minus having to put on the wheels, great item for the price.
0,Good, exactly as described
0,Quite solid, joints firm and screw appear well fixed.  Can position many ways.  Survived accidental dropping without damage. Have not yet plugged in fans however
0,Nice product.  Would prefer wrist rest to be a tad higher.	Does not have the residual smell of the gel version I replace.
0,I bought this for a friend he is well satisfied with the quality of the pen.
0,This is how I keep track of my smaller USB drives. Perfect for clipping to anything especially a key ring.

0,i use them everyday. love them
0,Picked up a Dr. Who Coloring book for my daughter over the weekend since her birthday is coming up soon and though this would be a great addition to the gift. She loved them and was thrilled with the color. They were a little difficult to get out of the shopping box. I literally had to cut the box apart, but once that was done it wasn't an issue. She ended up putting them in her canvas rolling pencil case anyway. Note that the pencils themselves are metallic in color, but the colors from the pencils do not have a metallic sheen.		I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This review ABSOLUTELY represents my true and honest opinion about this product. If it was crap I would absolutely say so. Check out my other reviews if you doubt :)
0,Terrible; slips easily on wooden floor; appears flimsy.. would rather throw away than take the hassle of sending back..		Update: The customer service is amazing. They took ownership and sent me a new mat at no cost to me, even though I offered them payment for it. The new mat is thicker, not slippery and hence safer in my office where fall prevention is desired.	I am happy with the new product and ordered 4 more.. !  (Hence changing  the rating to 4.5 stars from current 2 star)
0,This is a basic, effective art portfolio.  It will keep papers protected flat, secure, and protected from light.  Unless you prefer to use large format papers for your art, this portfolio works well.  An elastic cord holds the portfolio closed.		My 5th grader is a gifted artist.  He tends to use standard sizes of paper for his drawings, so this portfolio is perfect for him to store the drawings he wants to keep.  Sturdier than a simple folder, this portfolio keeps his drawings tidy and in great shape.  I'm sure at some point he will decide he needs a larger portfolio to hold bigger sheets of paper; in the meantime, this one will do the job well.
0,as advertised. works great.
0,HAVE BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY IN MY OFFICE AND WORKS LIKE NEW. VERY STURDY AND NO JAMS LIKE OTHER STAPLERS. MAGNIFICIENT PIECE OF ITEM.
0,I wasn't going to review these weights since all they have to do is be reasonably accurate, and they are.  I decided to review them because I wanted to point out that these weights are made out of an alloy that can be magnetized.  If using with a scale with ferrous material in the wrong location and if the weights become magnetized, they will not work well.  They should have been made out of a non-magnetic material, but this won't be a problem for most people.		On a scale with 0.1 gram resolution (not the same as accuracy) these are the results I got:	500.6 for the 500 gram calibration weight	200.2 ------> 200	100.1 ------> 100	50.0 --------> 50	This is close enough so I don't know if the scale or the weights are off.	When put on a scale with 1.0 gram resolution the results were right on.
0,Works great and looks professional
0,WOW, this thing rocks.  Very easy to set up to the network.  Booo Booo - not enough in the toner cartridge it came with.  On the other hand this is the Best vs inkjets if all you do is print black/white.  I was able to go with an off brand toner cartridge for $24 instead of $78.  And wouldn't you know it, I could not tell the difference from the original print vs the the third party's.  The fax machine works exceptionally well and so does the scanner.  This also does a decent job of printing (not the best), but with a few tweaks later I'll take it.  Unlike inkjets, toner has not dried out after long periods of non use.  If I ever need color, I will have to look at an alternative to ink....or just go over my INLAWS ;)	Best printer I have owned over the HP 940C, or a Canon inkjets, the inkjet cartridge's just are so expensive!  Every time I would turn around I was paying $20 for black inkjet or $46 for color inkjet cartridges.  Within a year I could be paying over $100 for the ink. The worst is when the ink would dry up after non use, frustrating.  So we decided on laser, so fast, well worth the money.	The only problem I had after almost 3 years the ip address kept resetting and I had to reestablish connection to all the devices.  The problem this kept happening, I finally had to pull out the manually and give this printer a permanent ip address.  Whew, that did the trick.  It has been going strong for 3 months now.
0,Great price, wouldn't buy it any place else
0,best pencil - writes so smoothly, lead doesn't break, and nice size for a comfortable grip - loved to find it in a color other than the standard blue!
0,Actually I haven't had to use these yet, the ones that came with the printer are still going strong!!
0,Works Perfect. Bought it for my son for this computer so he could print his homework. The WiFi printing works great. In can print from my Note Edge phone and Note Pro 12.2 Tablet.
0,I understand they don't make this anymore.  Buy it before it sells out.  I love it.
0,These markers are the perfect way to fulfill your children's "school supply" list. Every year we ask my son what they need whiteboard markers for and he says "nothing... only teachers use them" and frankly, whiteboard markers that are decent can be quite expensive when you already have a required $200.00 list to send per child. I use whiteboards at home, so I have a good idea of which work well for me personally.... but for school there's no need for big Expo markers and buying a separate eraser. I was thrilled to find this set because of the more compact size, built in erasers, and bright variety of 8 colors packed into only 4 slim markers.		The writing is very smooth and is a medium tip that's good for any use. There is little or no detectable odor compared to other brands. Thus far, he's had no issues with leaking, breaking, or dry-outs and apparently the built in erasers work well compared to the type with the "cheap foam cube" on the generic types. These are ergonomic for writing in cursive or print and the double ends don't get in the way of what you're doing. These are a great purchase whether at home or office and definitely for the dreaded school supply list. I'd highly recommend the set based on performance, quality, and price.
0,Good
0,The skeptic here about remans. I WILL order more or this brand, excellent photo colors! And a chip!
0,Oh. My. Goodness! This is the best shopping cart EVER! The cover is perfect for protecting my purchases during inclement weather. I love that the bag can be removed for easy carrying. This is perfect for fairs and flea markets.
0,Nice print quality.
0,Just what I needed.
0,good stuff
0,The cartridges shipped did not fit my printer.  The return time has expired.  Inkers phoned within an hour after I sent them e-mail and promised to send new cartridges, since the wrong ones had shipped.  What a great company!
1,Very upset. Whenever I print everything print orange color and fairly unreadable. Disappointed, would probably make more sense to buy ink cartridge from hp. Waste of money... its not my printer because 1 its new 2 I tried another ink solution and it worked. Very dissatisfied. Wouldn't buy ever again. Hopefully the seller see this and figures something out.
1,I got this same model and brand at a big box store and it broke on the first use.  The motor just quit working.  During that first use it had 3 jams.  This seems to be a faulty product and I am wondering if only super expensive models worked.  I took this back but only got a store credit.		Buyer Beware.
1,Repeat smudges when trying to print.
1,Now they got you paying over $100 for tiny ink cartridges. My PCS-1610 has lasted over 5 years. That's a record for an HP printer.		Nada
1,These kind of items are a necessity, AND when I saw 1 cent I thought "wow how's possible?" WELL I'll tell you how...the postage and handling is $5 lol.  I got more of the same type at $1.69 (5 Tabs) with FREE shipping.  You decide!  I did.
1,they are ink gel not rolling ball. must write with light touch
1,I don't like to use this magnifier because the handle is difficult and irritating to hold.		To have the rectangular viewing area horizontal (to get the widest horizontal view), I'll have to twist my wrist at an awkward angle. See my uploaded photo.		If the wrist is straight and at a comfortable angle, the rectangular viewing area would slanted diagonally at about a 30 degrees angle.		This would be simple for Bosch to solve. Just make the handle more horizontal so we don't have to bend our wrists to hold the magnifier such that the rectangular viewing area is horizontal. I wish designers would be more conscious of ergonomics & comfort.		In the meantime, I now hold it by the edges of the rectangular frame, or to hold the handle near to the mini 6x viewing area with my forefinger and thumb.
1,Very disappointed.  I have purchased several space pens for myself and as gifts.  This pen is great for writing with.  But it didn't store well.  The cap doesn't fit the pen.  It holds snug on the back side for writing.  But while in your pocket, the pen slides out of the cap.  Leaving you with a casio clipped to your pocket abd a pen that skids across the floor the first time you bend over.
1,Beware. You may get hit with a $10 premium service fee in order to get the software updated to continue to work. I had not used my device in a few months, now decided to try to use it again, and it no longer works with Google Voice. Since warranty is over, now I have to pay to get an update to the software so it can use Google Voice.
1,Let me start by saying, I'm obsessed with these pens. As a teacher, they're my very favorite. However this pack has me so disappointed =( So far, 3 pens have been dried out straight out of the package! This has never happened before, and I haven't even tried them all yet. Such a bummer
1,I suggested to my ex-fiancee that having a desk for a laptop and/or tablet would be nice. Instead, she got me this thing. Seeing the price now, I can't believe how expensive it must have been, yet it was so uncomfortable and awkward to actually use. It was heavy, bulky, and impractical for a laptop. The desk part on which the laptop sits actually swings open; for what, I have no idea. I wasn't really sure what the latticed "pockets" on the sides were for, except perhaps books or magazines, but certainly not for any computer accessories. It was impossible to use in a chair, and too wide to really use on a reclining chair or bed, unless you were the only person in that bed.		The point of a lap desk is comfort and convenience, but this was anything but. No padding or cushioning, easy to scratch, limitations on where it could actually be used, and practically impossible to store. Horrible item. It's only saving grace was that it looked nice, until it got all scratched up, because I couldn't find a place to store it safely. I can't believe how many positive reviews this thing has. I'm not one to just bash an item on the Internet, but this was one of the worst items I'd ever owned. I finally donated it to Goodwill. Soon, it will be someone else's problem, just like the Jumanji game.
1,It's not often I would give something so pricey a 1 star review, but this has earned it in every way. There is nothing I like about this locker.		First off, it's 100% plastic. Absolutely nowhere in the product description does it say this. From the pictures it actually looks metal, so I was unpleasantly surprised when I opened the box.		This is an absolute nightmare to assemble. The directions are terrible - I recommend not following them. My pieces were labeled appropriately (someone else's was not). They are supposed to 'snap' together. Good luck with this - I nearly broke it in half trying to snap these in place. You can use a hammer, but are far more likely to break the plastic. I literally was sweating trying to assemble this thing.		It has all these cheap, plastic push-nails to put in to hold everything together. Some don't line up correctly, so they don't actually go in. Then the side falls down, and you have to start over. I literally felt like I was being punked trying to assemble this.		Once it's all in place, you can awe in how cheap it is. My brother-in-law walked in the house once I was done and said "I hope you didn't pay much for this". My 4 year old daughter opened the door and then it wouldn't shut tight because IT'S MADE OF PLASTIC.		This is a useless toy. The included stickers are straight out of the 80s and were too ugly to put on. I wholeheartedly recommend against buying this.
1,I purchased two of these and they do not work well at all. After just a few pages they tell me they are low in toner and will not print regardless of what I do. Total waste of money.
1,Scratched easily
1,TOO EXPENSIVE - BETTER DEALS ON EBAY!
1,Returned
1,On some many levels this product is five stars, but the rollers are so noisy. An old wise man once said, "a little lube goes along way" The noise is so bad I struggled to give it 2 stars. I did that because if I lube the rollers it would be 5 stars. I looked to see where I could lube it up and there is no way to do it simply.
1,This landline phone was recommended by Consumer Reports but we were totally dissatisfied with it. The combination of numbers/letters/symbols needed to program anything was ridiculous. And we could not retrieve test voice messages using their instructions - even without changing the password code.
1,bubble wrap is bubble wrap - can mess that part up much. but 12 inch perforations do not work so it is really really tough to break apart.  if you are buying this to take advantage of the per perforated line, i would recommend another bubble wrap. if you have some scissors and cut what you need, this will do the job fine
1,Even though it is Kate Spade I was disappointed in this.  I guess I was expecting better quality for that price.
1,The tips were just blah after only a few uses. Will save for actual work and not just practicing.
1,The 2 stars are for the pretty colors that match my kitchen  The lack of more stars is for the fact that it says 12 pads but neglects to let you know there are only 25 sheets to a pad. Most post it note pads have 100 sheets.  The price is rediculous for what you get.
1,I bought two packages and NONE of them were sealed properly at the top, I had to replace all of them within one week of use.  Very disappointed as I had used these a few years ago and they lasted much longer.
1,I wanted to like this ink.  I really like Waterman black.  This one however always fades, when dry, to a more turquoise color.  A color I do not really like.  I tried it in several pens, including a new one and while the results do vary, I was always disappointed.  Regrettable purchase.
1,exchanged it for a better one
1,Didn't last very long.  The usual goes for this one.  You get what you pay for.
1,Very poor quality. One of the drawers was cut off so that you could not fasten it to the other pieces. Obviously a company (or employees) that cares little about quality. Just get 'em out the door I guess regardless of whether or not they are right.
1,If I could reverse time and buy another printer, I would. While looks fancy on the outside, this printer just breaks down and starts giving out multitudes of errors after use.		1) Print heads clog requiring frequent cleanings and lots of waste of ink	2) Print heads constantly require re-alignment	3) The dreaded hardware errors others mentioned here.	4) Unresponsive customer support. All they do is offer you another Cannon printer to buy	I wasted endless hours messing with us until one day I threw in the towel and just bought another brand. I recommend you do the same!
1,Do not look like the ones shown in the picture. Giving it one star bc at least it arrived
1,I love the pen EXCEPT it leaks. I flush and clean my pens regularly. I'll use it for a week, flush it and let it dry out while using another pen. After doing this 2-3 times it now leaks. Not good...
1,When I installed the color cartridge, my Dell printer displayed an error to the effect that the cartridge is not approved for the printer. The error disappears but the color printing is beyond awful (a checkerboard effect of mottled colors). AVOID.
1,The good: Great flow, fantastic color		The bad: Not nearly as permanent as other Noodler's inks		After being astounded by the quality (and permanence) of Noodler's Bulletproof Black, I was looking for a similar permanent blue ink to complement it, and decided to try Bad Belted Kingfisher. It's a good ink with amazing color, but lacks the staying power I was looking for. In water, a good amount of it runs and washes away. Other reviews claim that this smearing behavior is a "security feature", but Noodler's Black doesn't smear at all after it dries. When exposed to bleach or peroxide, Kingfisher fades a great deal. The remaining marks are still legible, but leave much to be desired.		I returned Kingfisher and replaced it with Bad Blue Heron, with which I am much more impressed.
1,Nexus 7, kindle, Casio commando: stylus fails to register on all my devices.		Pen and pencil are Ok but nothing special.  Since I only purchased this item for its supposed stylus functionality I give it low marks.
1,Purchased from Open Box/Warehouse dept. The roll of whiteboard had been "bent" and was difficult to put on the wall.  I was not able to use it for the project I purchased it for.  We did use it as an emergency in a meeting that had to be held out in the plant.  It had an inspection sticker on it.  I do not know where the failure was; the lack of quality inspection or the packaging of the product for shipment.  The quality of the product it's self was as expected.
1,staples that  come loaded in stapler are junk(kept jamming on single sheet of paper) almost sent unit back.happened to have some Stanley staples they work great
1,+ kind of cute		- magnets are very weak. I tested them on my fridge and they kept falling off when I opened/closed the doors using normal strength.	- fraying threads everywhere. EVERYWHERE. Even when I remove them, there are frayed threads all over the place when I return.		Would recommend getting&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/4-Refrigerator-Magnets-Farm-Animals-Sheep-Cow-Pig-And-Donkey-Plush-Animal-Magnet-For-Refrigerator-Dry-Erase-Board-Or-Any-Metal-Surface-Fridge-Magnets-Dry-Erase-Board-Magnets/dp/B06XC3Z8SL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">4 Refrigerator Magnets- Farm Animals (Sheep, Cow, Pig And Donkey), Plush Animal Magnet For Refrigerator, Dry Erase Board Or Any Metal Surface, Fridge Magnets, Dry Erase Board Magnets</a>&nbsp;instead.
1,OMG I laughed when I opened this up.. for the price I was so disappointed .... this is super small
1,These pens are great if you need to do drawing or sketching with a very fine tip. I liked the quality of most of the pens, except I had one pen no# 2 which was almost dry (and I just got the package yesterday).		These pens were not lasting ones. Many of them dried up pretty fast, and after 3 months all are dried. Otherwise, I think these are very good pens.
1,Most of the inside packages were torn when we received them.
1,These cartridges don't print clean. I got them for the price and after having a great experience with another generic cartridges. I shouldn't have ordered a spare package. I am going back to the previous cartridges. Had to take in to a printer repair shop to get my printer cleaned. I will need another cleaning, and by then I would have spent the same amount as the OEM cartridges. Not worth the time and energy.
1,This thing is a joke. Don't even waste your money on it. I used the tape roll that came with the gun and never could get it to print out right. the ink was sputtery and it never would line up. I didn't even buy the replacement stickers because it worked so badly. I should have returned it but ended up getting so frustrated with it I just threw it away. :(
1,Very flimsy boxes.  The humidity in the air caused them to become weak and unstable when stacked.
1,=====UPDATE======12/19/13	We don't use this often at all, this is for home use for one person, and we have a host of mechanical pencils, so we HARDLY EVER USE THIS THING. It's now broken.		So, after sharpening probably 50 pencils, it works no more. Just a large piece of worthless plastic. Total JUNK! We're back to our old scholastic pencil sharpener that probably cost 50 cents.		=====OLD REVIEW=======	Pros: Sharpens a pencil BEAUTIFULLY! It's picture perfect with a true point and no straggly pieces of wood dangling.		Cons: You need to use both hands to operate this thing. One hand to hold it firmly down, the other to push the pencil in. If you don't hold it down hard, it will spin over onto it's side.	Also, I'm not entirely sure when it's done sharpening. Other sharpeners can make a different noise or slow the grind but I can't tell with this X-ACTO model.		So, it works well, but I'm not sure I'd buy it again.
1,Don't buy it.  I had about 150.00 in change to count and roll.  Took a few days because I had to stop so often.  When it says it only can manage 1 to 10 coins , its not kidding.  It jams up ALOT.  I said it will be good to keep by my night stand so when I empty my change it won't be much so I ll use it like that.  Still jams, you have to stop remove tubes and shake it upside down to get coins out.  It's disappointing but when you only pay about 20 bucks, you get what you pay for.  On the up side, it's better than nothing.
1,Will never buy HP again. After having the printer failing, then reloading the software and then the printer works....hmmm. Seems to me hp is sabotaging their own product so you will buy a new one. So I did, but not another HP.
1,Comes with a warning note that states "warning: This product contains chemical known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm." I wish they would have said that in the description or told you what chemicals are in this product because I'm pregnant and would never have purchased the product.
1,The pencils themselves are OK to use with coloring books that have a bit more paper tooth.	- The lead is very thin, probably in the .2mm range and seemed (to me) to have a harder lead vs. Crayola or Prisma Color Scholar.  If you are accustom to using those brands, you will be disappointed in the way these pencils preform.	- A thinner, harder lead pencil can be helpful when outlining, however it is difficult to fill larger areas of a drawing with color.	- Very difficult to blend colors because of the hardness of the lead	- Some of the colors appeared to be the same, or so close in color that I could not tell a difference on the color chart I created.	- The pencils are numbered but not named.	- Unfortunately, the pencil case has a terrible chemical smell.  I believe it contains a petroleum product. I immediately took the pencils out of the case and threw the case away.  I could not use the pencils for a least a month after they were removed from the case because they retained the chemical smell	- I personally do not use these but are fine for my children to use in their coloring books - AFTER the smell dissipated from the pencils
1,I initially purchased this calculator because I wanted a desktop size, medium priced for the slight daily usage it would get.  This product is a piece of junk!  I have gone through two with the warranty and I won't get another one.  This type of product is unacceptable, and I would say should be pulled from Canon's product line.  Both times, the same identical malfunctions occurred.  I would suggest trying a Sharp or Texas Instruments brand.
1,My Samsung did not even think it had a new cartridge
1,This cheap phone will not stand on its own. It is made very cheaply. More importantly it did not work. You get what you pay for.
1,The accordian expansion sides catch and hold the various manilla folders making it difficult to flip through the	manilla folders to find what I want. I also don't like the sliding hangers which slide in too easily making 1 or more fall off the hanging rails.
1,First, the good news.	The display is excellent.  The backlighting of the keys is excellent.	The batteries hold up very well.	Overall, the phone part is very good, although the range is a little short.	My old 2.4 GHz Panasonic phone would work 250 feet from my house.  The Uniden, at 5.8 GHz loses signal after about 100-150 feet.  So it is difficult to use in the yard.  Disappointing.		The charger base for the 2nd handset would benefit from being weighted.  It is very easy to knock off the bedside table when you grab the phone.		I already had a TRU9485-4WX and except for the short range, I really liked the phone.  So we bought the Uniden TRU9465-2 as a gift.  The picture looked 'just like' our phone, which does have an answering machine but this phone had only two phones.  Just what we were looking for!		But I missed the part where there is no answering machine on this phone.  It has 'voice mail' capability, where you can tie into your phone company's voice mail???	Yes ... I should have read the fine print.	But why in the world would a $79 phone not have an answering machine?		I felt this phone was a bit expensive when I thought it HAD an answering machine but I liked my existing phone.	Without an answering machine, this phone is WAY overpriced.
1,don't waste your money, this come off quickly and the paper quality is not too good!!! I won't buy this item ever!!!
1,The reason for the 1 star is that the HP 6100 printer is an ink hog. Not sure if the ink evaporates or uses a ton. Seriously thinking of round filing it.
1,Had to return
1,Just ran out and replaced with one I brought back probably a few month or 2 month ago. No black.  What do I do?
1,Okay, I purchased this printer to replace another Xerox I had for years that had finally went to its grave. Even a Xerox won't last forever. Right? Well this replacement started giving me problems in less than six months with very limited usage. It kept wanting me to replace the yellow toner cartridge, which I did twice with genuine Xerox toner, yet still would not function. At all! After doing some searching on the web I discovered my problem is a very common one with this series of printers. And the fix offered from Xerox? NONE! Replace it. Unbelievable. What a waste of time and money.
1,too slick for my mouse. too thin as well. nothing precise about this. in fact, i think my mouse works better on the bare table than it does with this. The sticky side is a terrible idea. It gets dirty very quickly, doesn't stick anymore, but you have that nasty glue backing on it and it's just not something you want to use. very cheaply made.
1,cheap product, did not fit well (should have been my first clue), then it actually blew up one night and got glass everywhere. would not buy or recommend. made it maybe 4 months on average use.
1,I received this pen on December 24. It worked fine, till last night on my drive home it was in my pocket. Cap tightly screwed on and the pen leaked all over my pants and everything underneath. I do not recommend this product.
1,I have this really thick eyeliner pencil (Tarte SmolderEYES).  None of my regular sharpeners were big enough to handle it, and I really like the color, but it was getting to the point where I couldn't use it any longer.  I didn't want to pay for shipping from Tarte so I bought this.		Well.  This mangled the end of my eyeliner pencil.  It didn't trim the wood part evenly and it completely crushed/smashed the eyeliner inside.  I lost probably a half inch of product trying to get this to work.  I held it in both hands, trying to see where I'd have better control of the pencil.  I held the pencil as straight as possible inside the hole.		I think part of the problem was the blade was not sharp enough for this particular pencil (for which the wood part is fairly hard, to be sure).  At any rate, the smashing of the eyeliner part of the product all over the inside made the blade hard to clean, too.		This *may* still work for pencils even larger than the Tarte SmolderEYES, where they can't wiggle around as much in the hole while you sharpen them.  It also may work for sharpening products that aren't as hard on the outside, and for products where the actual makeup part is firmer than with the Tarte product I was attempting to sharpen.  (I ended up buying the Tarte sharpener for two bucks.  Live and learn, I guess.)  I will save this because I may end up with a really thick cosmetic pencil one day, where this may come in handy.
1,I am disappointed in these. They do not stick well at all. I have used the Post-it brand for years and they used to stick very well. I guess I will buy some generic brand next time, I am sure they at least as good as these and they are way cheaper.
1,Does not hold up well at all in my wallet. Would not recommend.
1,Had my first couple of cartridge failures after half life on these after about 15 others without failure.  Unfortunately, 2 is too many and I will be considering a separate supplier.		EDIT - An additional 2 cartridges failed and I am in constant print head cleaning.  Do Not recommend
1,I don't really enjoy the ribbed condoms. I feel nothing but the condoms when "in use". If you care about pleasure then I suggest picking something else, like the thins.
1,edge cuts were jagged. Unable to use as a presentation board.
1,It does sharpen though I found that the "Sharp Sense" technology either doesn't work or doesn't work for me (or my other two family member who tried it after I couldn't "sense" it, even though my kid & I have hypersensitive systems & can "feel" a car idling in the lot a few floors down, behind closed doors & windows, at the other end of our modern masonry construction, three story, sound dampening apartment building so Sharp Sense seemed like it would work for us).  We tried a few different pencils and they were ground down to more than half their full, new, starting size and still, no indicator of sharpness other than taking the pencil out and visually examining it.  Other than that, we had pencils that are considered standard and fit in our old manual sharpener without issue, but they were not accepted by the iPoint. The sharpener is built well and plugs in, which are bonuses for us.
1,People like to brag about how they still use their HP calculator from the 80's: you apparently can't do that with the newly built models.		I bought this calculator in late 2013.  I don't use it frequently, mostly for doing TVM calculations when making big life decisions (house, car, etc.).  It was kind of an expensive purchase for occasional use, but my academic background is in engineering and I warship at the altar of RPNI have trouble using a "normal" algebraic calculatorplus, there's peace of mind in using an HP because their numerical algorithms are top-notch.  Today, I was going to do a little work on the tax return so of course I whipped out the trusty HP.  Oddly, it repeatedly gave me weird results for some TVM calculations while I was reviewing our mortgage.  Then, it froze.  That's never happened before!  Naturally, I pushed the "reset" button hidden under the battery cover: I got a Pr Error on the display (good sign, showing it reset), but nothing more.  Replacing the batteries with a fresh set did not clear the Pr Error on the display.  This calculator is infrequently used and there is no excuse for it completely failing.
1,WAY TOO small of rolls. Had to keep changing the roll.
1,My old cordless finally "passed away", so I had ordered this a while back and was anxious to get it going, as my old cordless was a VTECH also and had been very happy with it I felt I was getting about the same thing.  It appears in the picture that the screen lights up, it does not, the numbers do, but not the screen, so you cannot see who is calling, now I am stuck with it, so needless to say I do not recommend this item.
1,Neither of them worked!!!  They had to be returned. It was as if they were empty, however I could feel the weight from the ink. Thought I would give it a try, won't do that again.  Decided to buy Lexmark name brand they cost more but are reliable.
1,I like that pads themselves.  The quality is very good, and I appreciate that they are recycled.  Unfortunately, I think this product is way too expensive.  Right now, the price is over a dollar a pad, and they aren't even full-size pads.  The pads in this set only have 75 sheets, compared to typical post it notes with 100 sheets per pad.  The use of, most likely, chemical dyes offsets any environmental value.  I say most likely because the packaging doesn't mention the dying process, but I think it is fair to assume that if the dyes were environmentally friendly it would have been mentioned on the package.  So, ultimately, you are not really benefiting the environment by using these, which makes it a waste of money.
1,I don't think this is a good phone. The sound quality is not good. I guess the price for four phones seems good but I wish I didn't get it. One of the batteries seems dead after almost no use.		Other reviewers have stated the problems with this phone, yet some like it.		If one doesn't care about call blocking or using a headset, if one is ready to accept problematic batteries, and if it's important to get four phones fast without regard for long-term performance, then why not.
1,this is not good Im not happy :(
1,As an owner of over 20 drafting pencils I can say that this pencil is one of the worst I own. The nurling on this pencil is awful, as in many Pentel pencils. It may look as a beautiful pencil but that's it. I do not recommend this pencil. For this price buy instead a Uni Kuru Toga, a Tombow Monograph Zero or a Zebra Delguard.
1,Cheap. Way too thin. Would probably only get 1 to 3 uses from them. They crinkle very easily.
1,This is so small not sure what to do with it. My bad did not read the dimensions. Someone put together for me and threw away the box so I cannot send it back.
1,I've bought this product in the past and had good results but my latest purchase the black cartridge gave me an error message on my printer but when I install a generic cartridge it works fine and no error message. This tells me the black cartridge in this two pack is defective. I would return it but it has passed the 30 day Amazon return window.
1,What moronic crap.
1,I did not like these and would never buy again.
1,I don't why I keep thinking these design and print templates from Avery will work easily; they never do.		The first attempt to find the Microsoft word program template is a failure -- the way the instructions say to find it leads to nothing. Attempts to find and download the proper template onto my computer is also a failure. So I'm stuck with designing online.		Having used their online program before I can figure it out but it isn't particularly easy to do if you are trying for your first time. Sure you could live chat with a rep but in the past when I've tried that it wasn't much help at all. I set up the image I want to use for the magnet sheet and print out a test. That looks great so I want to save it to my computer so I can take it to a print shop to get full color.		However when I look at what saved it can't be opened by any applications I have on my computer... sigh.  Very disappointing.		I think they need to double check with Microsoft and make sure their programs are really on computers or offer a way to save a pdf of what you what you design in their online shops.
1,The product is well packaged but the stand itself did not work for me. This is my experience with the stand. I placed a brand new 15.6" laptop (HP Envy 360). The screw on the back of the stand would not stay fastened so the laptop kept shifting. I was concerned for the integrity of the stand and opted to remove my laptop and return it so that I do not damage my laptop. I even placed a rubber washer to help the grip, but that still did not help.
1,I would have rated this high except for one major issue. It is not what it says it is. The item is advertised as POSTCARDS and heavyweight. That is what I expected. However, the paper is thin and bends easily, unlike "postcard" material. I found it flimsy for mailing. The material is more like those magazine insert mailing forms; thin, bendable, easily rips, etc. It has a nice texture, might be good for artwork, receipe cards, cut well, prints nice, and states that it meets US Postal Regs. However, not at all what I wanted.
1,Only lasted less then a year and had tons of problems with the ink clogging in the heads. No easy way to replace the heads. Used to love Epson but this printer made me switch to HP.
1,One corner had a sharp cracked  chip on the edge of it before I even got the plastic off. It is sharp and the plastic cracked kinda like glass, so now it there is a sharp edge. Thought it would e a little thicker with a different type of non-chipping plastic.
1,Not pleased at all. I purchased them for coloring, but tear/roll up my cardstock.
1,I have a Plantronic headset that works well when connected to the Panasonic base or three other systems I have, including other cordless. Unfortunately the jack on these Panasonic handsets is defective and the other party can't hear you when using a headset (tried two headsets, one brand new). Panasonic suggested a replacement from Amazon, but this new ones have the same issues. Panasonic Support was unable to assist, asking to pull the batteries in hope the issue would magically go away... They're going back.
1,I normally love these pens.  They are very smooth and the ink is clear and dark.  But this batch was not consistent.  I bought a box, but unlike other boxes that I have purchased, this was just a plain white box with no printing on it.  The other boxes have printing on them identifying the manufacturer and type of pens (same packaging as you would find in an office supply store).  I didn't think much of this, but when I looked at the pens, half of them did not have the little red plastic drop on the tips of the pens.  A few of these seemed used (less ink).  It wasn't a lot less, but it was noticeable with about 3 or 4 mm less ink.  I also tried a few and they did not have a consistent feel or ink.  Some had darker blue ink than others.  Some were not as smooth and you can tell from the output that the ink was not full but was streaky.
1,Great price however the colors are not very good. I would not purchase again if looking for vibrant colors.
1,On arrival the lock was broken internally. There was not way to see the problem. The key went in, the lock turned, and it jammed shut permanently. If my important documents were in the box, they would have been locked in.		The locking mechanism is absolute junk. It's incredibly flimsy. Bicycle locks are much better made. This thing is a disgrace.		You're basically buying a piece of plastic with baby diaper gel inside and a lock that will fail at any moment and leave important items trapped inside.		I will be looking for other options, even if they cost a bit more. Securing critical papers is far more important than saving a few dollars.
1,Never worked.  I wanted to add highlights to watercolor but nothing comes out but clear liquid.  I carefully followed instructions with pressing tip and shaking, etc but it never worked.
1,Just received this pencil sharpener.  Right out of the box, it isn't seated properly and will not work unless I hold it together to sharpen a pencil.  Not happy will be returning it.  Sharpens ver good but won't stay closed.
1,Cheaply built.  Waste of time and money
1,This was ordered and delivered without a hitch, however, the ink cartridge was not in its original cardboard wrapper which concerned me.  The paper wrapper, however, appeared to be okay but certainly more vulnerable to damage in shipping.
1,I tried installing the last cyan ink cartridge in my printer and it was the wrong size. It wouldn't fit so I had to run to Best Buys and buy one.	Very frustrating to say the least.  They were all working OK up to this point and then this happened. Office World works.  Sophia Global doesn't work.
1,I baby my drawing pencils, yet this sharpener reduced them to stumps as point after point broke off in this sharpener. Did I get a defective unit or what? My opinion of Faber Castell has significantly diminished!
1,Not that great unless you like this type of binding.
1,The platform is way too sensitive, breathing or leaning skews the reading by several pounds.
1,Too flexible and lightweight.  The mat moves on my carpet, forcing me to reposition it constantly.
1,I always get bad toners. Just yesterday, I had one telling me the color was wrong?? Black is black..	Still cheaper than OEM.
1,junk don't work
1,Was not a smooth sharpener. It chopped up the wood around the lead so that it broke and fell out. I bought a different sharpener that works much better. This was a waste of money.
1,School Time and I'm am starting the supply gathering.  I just requested this FIVE STAR Pencil Pouch and I just purchased a generic UP&UP pencil pouch at Target.  Guess what?  Target one is far superior and about $4 plus tax.		Target Pouch - has 4 zippers which are all on the front side or top.  5Star has only 3 zippers, 2 on the front, 1 on the back.		Target Pouch is slightly larger and has constructed of a stiff material.  The 5Star is made of what looks like a stop-rip fabric but can't be 100 percent sure.		5Star Zippers on the front look similar but have nicer pulls.  Unfortunately they don't feel as solid as the cheaper product. The Zipper on the back is cheap and smaller.  No way it will last a whole year.		SUMMARY	I could have gone on at length but the cheaper Pencil Case I purchased is much superior. It has a netting on the front pockets which allow you to see what's inside. The 5Star Pouch does NOT.		The single back pocket with the flimsier zipper is also not desirable.		I LOVE many FIVE STAR products but not this pencil pouch.  The only things it has going for it is that you can order on Amazon, and it has a large pocket.
1,this is not what I wanted, tabs are big but quality is cheap, not sturdy.  I had to go th Staples and buy the one I wanted.  Made with stronger quality.
1,This is advertised and billed as card stock but it is only cover stock.  Paper is nice but not what I needed.  Packaging was not sufficient either.  It had 1 air pillow in the package and it was flat as a pancake.
1,It's a little flimsy and has the worst packaging! They shrink-wrap the clipboard, and then add the metal clip after that. So you have to peel the plastic off and it gets stuck under all the screws and the clip, and then it tears. So then you have these little bits of plastic sticking out from all the screws and the clip. So annoying.  Also the board has some weird discolorations. But whatever, it's just a clipboard, so I'm keeping it.
1,I really should have listened to everyone else.  I have a fitbit device, and I even lost it once and they replaced it for free.  I like that device, and the company was so responsive when I lost it, I figured I would try this scale despite all of the warnings about setting it up.  I figured, hey, this is a good, responsive company.  I've worked with computers for most of my professional life, and understand how to set up networks.  I'll bet i can make it work!  Big mistake.  The issue is the scale is only compatible with 802.11b, and does not play well with modern dual band routers like most people have these days.  After several hours of manipulating router settings, I finally gave up.  Only in killing my own network bandwidth down to 802.11b was it going to work.  What a waste of time and money.  It is ridiculous for a scale that costs this much money, and purports to be modern technology, be this screwed up.  For what it is worth, the Fitbit support folks were helpful and prompt.  The problem is not them, it is the crappy old technology they chose to use for this scale.  I'm returning mine.  Don't buy it unless you have an 8 year old router and don't care about network bandwidth.  What a disappointment.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.
1,This Belkin product is not what I expected, i.e., The cushion fails to supply enough support, and the mouse area is in need of more territory, so to speak. Overall, this item is 2nd class, and a poor value!
1,Read the description carefully as I did not. 1. Comes from China s o takes forever to get here. 2. Costs more to return than I paid.  I usually do not buy from the marketplace for this reason but I guess I really wasn't paying g attention when I ordered. My iPhone 6s doesnt come close to fitting in this bag so don't buy it for a phone bag as pictured.
1,i have bought 2, for our homeschool, and i am the only one who uses it. both have broken and they barely sharpen a pencil. i hate this sharpener.
1,Does NOT WORK on my PC Win 8.1	It installed, worked and printed 2 CD's then a bug grew which error message prevents the program from opening.	Without the ability to open the program, it dosn't work.	Save your money and buy a Genuine Avery product directly from Avery (not Amazon)	The CD labels do not fit the stomper as the hole in the labels is larger than the stomper. (I have to wiggle it around to sim-center it.)		DON'T BUY
1,I ended up returning this ink because i received the pens that go with it and I was able to sample one.  The ink ran all over the document i was using at the time. i tried a few other sheets but it continued to run and spread. I wasn't happy with it so i sent it back.
1,Great! This is the most useful planner I've always used but I've always wondered on the price! Why would you charge $10 of this?
1,I have consumed more than half a dozen of these Moleskine pocket hardcover notebooks over the past few years.  Overall I'm quite disappointed in their long-term performance, especially for the price and all the marketing hype.  I guess that's what these come down to - pure hype.  They tout names of famous writers like Hemingway and Chatwin almost as if they actually used their products.  I know for a fact that Ernest Hemingway died before the Moleskine Srl *brand* of notebooks came into being.  Sure, the old writers used to use "moleskine" or leather-bound notebooks, but they were handmade and undoubtedly of better quality.  These aren't even leather bound; they are bound with some kind of plastic simulated leather.		The paper is of decent quality, but bleeds through pretty easily and frays at the edges.		But the most irritating thing about the Moleskine Srl notebooks is the fact that the binding is as fragile as eggshells.  Every single one of the notebooks I've been through has required reinforcement by tape and/or glue before 1/3 of the pages had been written on.  They just cannot handle day-to-day repetitive use.  The threads come apart, the pages work loose from the threads, and the faux leather binding cracks at the "hinge" area.  Eventually the strip of paper in the spine that's holding together the mini booklets of paper inside eventually rips and the binding just falls apart from within.		I suppose the only reason I've used so many of them was because I just wanted to a good notebook and they sure *seem* like they'd be good when you pick one up in the store.  Like Mulder on the X-Files, I really wanted to believe in Moleskine.  And I wanted to give the product an honest chance before giving up on it.  But now I'm convinced they are not worthy of my good notes.  Maybe I'll use the ones I still have for mundane stuff like shopping lists or something.  They COULD be a good notebook if Moleskine could just build a durable binding.		For now, for my "good notes" that are worth keeping, I'm switching over to the Leuchtturm 1917 pocket notebooks.  I'll go through a few of those and then write a review on them.  So far, they seem much more promising even though the Leuchtturms have more of a "perfect" type binding and the pages do not lay flat like on the Moleskine.  I can live with that, though.
1,I want to like these field notes, which have decent paper, a cool design, and are unique, but there are quality control issues.		These notebooks feel like real wood on the outside, and thats because they are. The standard kraft cover is veneered with wood, which is left untreated so that you can feel the rough grain texture on the cover. They also smell like wood. I like the paper inside, which is thick and somewhat fountain pen friendly. The copper staples are also a nice plus. Mostly, these notebooks are unique because of the wood cover.		However, all three of my notebooks have delamination of the wood around the corners, which both looks awful and exposes risk of splinters. It shouldnt have to be said that a notebook shouldnt cause splinters.
1,I really had high expectations for these pens. I am new to handlettering- which is obvious in attached pic. I have been playing around with it for a while and had read that these pens are great for beginners. I got them today and busted them out and was frustrated right away. As you can see, the ink flow is that of a marker that is getting ready to run out of ink. It didn't improve much upon using a couple more times. I am not sure if I just got a dud set, or if this is standard, but I would say that there might be better options out there for you :)
1,A PAIN
1,Useless on magazine covers, shipping labels or anything readable.	Needs to be used a dozen times before the text can become almost unreadable.	This will not protect your address on magazine covers without cutting the cover.	Not the perfect solution, nor is this stamp even slightly effective.	The ink can easily be removed by scrapping it off with a coin or sharp object.	Not recommended for use of protecting sensitive information.
1,Not a god product.  Was not very sturdy.  I sent it back.
1,I've purchased 3 of these all from different sellers here on Amazon and none worked.  When I contacted HP they gave me the royal run around, requesting I take screws out etc to try and fix the issues.  That is not a good way to do business.  I figure they are pretty much out of business (or should be) with all the broken chinese stuff they got to try and sell.  First one worked for about 100 pages (document feeder) then just quit working.  Second one had a broken piece of plastic hanging down where the paper is fed after it leaves the document feeder (up near the top).  Third one was used filthy, scratched up, had broken plastic and the cd software was cracked in half.  It was obvious they are near the end of the run with this model and are selling the broken one's now trying to unload them.  That's why I feel HP is near the end of the line, business-wise.  I've owned many of their products and never had major issues like this before.  I've owned their computers both pc and laptop, 12 of their printers etc without issue to speak of until now with this model printer.  I'd avoid this model and maybe any others they are offering until they go through another upper management change and clean out all the junk they got in their warehouse.  I might add that all of these had factory seal on the boxes.  So they packed these this way.  There is no excuse other than really immoral practices.  I tried writing the headquarters to report these issues but never received a reply.  That speaks volumes.		When all else fails visit a va hospital and you'll feel a lot luckier.
1,I was very excited about getting a great deal, and I've used many generic toners, but this one is so far the worst. After just few pages, there was no more black... it was all grey and smudgy, and I could see lines here and there that didn't belong anywhere on the page. I shook it a bit and that somewhat helped, but it's been nearly 100 pages already and copies are bad, just bad. I'm going to need new toner already. I bought a two-pack, so now I'm stuck with two bad toners. Yay! What a deal, right? NOT
1,Stuck with no printer at a critical time, bought a yellow cartridge and it failed (printer thought it was empty) after about one week.  Do not know what say, I use used to like this printer, not anymore.  You have had failed cartridges or you will, simple as that, not a reliable product.
1,It worked fine for a year, under very light use.  I probably used it for 15 large prints.  Then one day after finishing a nice print, the next print looked totally weird, and my assessment was that the black ink wasn't printing.  After 1 1/2 hours on line with Epson I was referred to the local repair shop, and they concluded both of the black ink heads were toast.  The cost to fix the problem would have been $400 and of course all this happened a week after the warranty ran out, so rather than put $400 into a printer with a dubious track record, I junked it.  So I lost $600 which was my original cost (net of an Epson rebate at the time), plus over $100 in extra ink supplies that I will never use but hope to sell.  Interestingly, the factory authorized repair shop said that Epson printers make great prints but are very touchy and neurotic.
1,It's a piece of JUNK!  Do NOT buy.  I should have listened to the other bad reviews.  I was able to emboss one word straight out of the package and then suddenly it stopped working.  Now it only prints out dots instead of the letters. Tried changing the tape cartridge and it still prints out only dots.  Very upset.  Have to write to Amazon to return it along with the extra refill tapes I bought.
1,I really like this pan, previous one I had for many years, but I lost it so I decided to buy a new one. I was really happy at first but after about a month of writing, it almost doesn't write. And I'm not writing a lot. Disappointed.
1,The price was good, but the delivery was a bit slow. And, the product was not what I expected. The ink ran out way too fast, as though some had no ink at all.
1,Tabs dig into wrists
1,Cant get in because you can only replace the keys from inside. So I have stuff in there that I cant get. Been sitting for a couple years. Will cost me about $70 to get it cut open.
1,Puffy and soft but not the color pictured so I disappointed in it
1,We have several printers in our office and run through quite a bit of ink. I thought I could save some money with these remanufactured combo packs, but the secretaries asked me to please buy the original equipment next time, as these didn't work well.
1,Even on my best stationary, they feel like writing on concrete. How I got sold was I had one of these to use for a few minutes, it glided across paper with sublime ease,  so  I bought a pack here.  Meh, they write and feel horrible.
1,I loved this pen. Sure, the cap didn't stay posted well, but it was a cost effective pen that fit into my pocket without being to small to use comfortably. However, after two months of semi-regular use, the ink mysteriously started to skip so much that it rendered the pen unusable. The ink cartridge was full. I tried all the ball point pen tricks, scribbling until the ink was flowing (it would just immediately go back to skipping after I stopped,) holding a lighter flame close to the ball for a few seconds, changing the paper, nothing worked. Eventually I threw it away because it was essentially worthless. I mean it literally would not write. You would just get a few dots here and there, that's it.
1,Did not like this and returned it.  Too big and heavy to move
1,Well it came quick, great Amazon service, but the product didn't work for my file drawer.  Of course I didn't realize this until I had this mess assembled, its for short squatty drawers maybe standard type file cabinets.  This was a desk drawer so before you assemble read the return instructions now I'm flushed 21$ down the pipes.  Disappointed since it took about 30 minutes or so to assemble.
1,Ill only use Prime now.  This was a horrid, costly experience.  Ill take some of the blame but the Seller was a brat!
1,For a Cross pen, it is a disappointment. It is lightweight and comfortable. The nib writes so scratchy, if the ink even gets to it. It does not write fluidly. Also the cap comes off easily. This pen is a Cross disaster. The Cross brand always meant quality and perfection in writing materials. They chose the cheap path for this pen.
1,Not truly clear and crisp
1,Valuemailers advertised false item.  The measurement for this item is totally wrong.  It's wider (6.25") and shorter (9.25") and not standard Kraft #0 6 x 10.  Beware they will ask you to ship the item back on your expenses and refund less the shipping you paid.  The only true compatible Kraft #0 6 x 10 is made by CPI Packaging Value-lite mailer.  You can find it from theboxery.com.  Not many vendors carry the true 6x10 quality mailers.
1,Terrible--really flimsy and doubt they will hold up very long.  The colors are not very exciting either but I wouldn't complain if the over all quality was better.  Avery usually makes better products then this.  Look around for something better now or you will be doing so very soon as these are bad....
1,I installed this cartridge and a few minutes later I was informed I was out of ink. Tried to return-exchange but was told that was not possible; the cartridge was out of stock and these could only be exchanged not refunded.
1,This pen is beautiful, but functionality is not as good as the appearance,  I have only tried cartridges,  The don't start feeding ink without an effort.  After sitting for a couple of weeks, the ink disappears from the cartridge.  I assume it evaporated.  So I wonder if the pen is ok and the cartridge (or ink) is the problem.
1,I bought this about 5 months ago.  Haven't used any of the toner yet... I don't do much printing. However, part of the drum unit fell apart already. The metal bar that hangs on the bottom came loose and one of the plastic pieces that holds it on fell off into the printer. Now it has a loud clicking noise. Had to buy a replacement drum already. The first one from Brother lasted over 4 years. Like I said, I don't print too often.
1,is just a box made out of cardboard, and a few pieces of plastic to hold in place certain areas, I do not think I'm going ever going to buy another one, it was hard to assemble, I'm very good assembling things and working with my hands, but I had trouble assembling this, the instructions are not very clear to a certain extend for your regular users this would been impossible to assemble it, it took me about 25-30 minutes to assemble it cause I did not wanted to bend or break!		When I finally sort of assemble it, I start it to fill it with documents for everyone to grab in my office, well, it looks like it could not hold that much weight, I notice it is bending a little.		I feel like I had purchase something from the Dollar stores.
1,I bought these to make glasses for some custom Funko pops thinking they were clear like it says on the product. However not clear, not even frosty,  it's legit white. Very disappointed and misleading.
1,I was looking forward to using this tool as a guide to kick start my college semester and work. Just like the book, it's too confusing and jumbled to know what to do. Mainly only talks about her life and not much on helping the customer.
1,I'v e tried 3 of these now and none last longer than a couple months.  They jam up so bad, that you can't even unjam them.  Not sure what happened to Swingline, but I won't buy another product with their name on it.
1,It functions properly, but the buttons are pretty stiff.
1,Right out of the pack these labels curled fairly dramatically at the tops and the bottoms. The curl affects the top 1 inch or so, so it is not possible to do a "mass-reverse curl".  Each time I want to print labels i first have to carefully roll the curled top portion backwards, one page at a time, reversing the curl, taking care to roll it in a rounded manner, without crinkles or it won't feed properly in the printer.  What a hassle!	I can't wait til i use these up. A-a-a-a-a-a-g-h!
1,It's okay. Kind of tacky, plastic looking, once I put it next to the door. But it applies and stays put. I'll be replacing it very soon.
1,This came broken. I don't know if this is a Rolodex problem or a Price Bully problem.
1,these pencils don't come with very usable points for writing and yet they don't sharpen easily either. It's not their length but the cheap quality of the pencil that makes it a struggle.
1,Terrible, clumsy, have to turn yourself inside out to cut. Cheapy frames which come with tape work 10x better. Sorry I bought this and if not so cheap would definitely return it. Instead I'll just take the tape out and put it into one of the cheapy frames when that tape wear out.		The ergonomic aspect was very appealing. But it's heavy and does not work easily...and no, I don't have it upside down, or the tape put in the wrong way. I very carefully set it up before use.		Do not buy: too heavy, not ergonomic, clumsy, etc.
1,These are very inferior to their other medium duty storage boxes and not even much cheaper. I bought a bunch of them because the office supply didn't have the old standby 12773 boxes, now 12770 recycled I think. The 703's have perf attachments you need to separate and no matter how careful, you are likely to bend or rip the cardboard tearing them off. I finally resorted to pre-cutting the perfs with a razor knife. And in assembling the boxes it is easy to bend the sides, thus making them weaker in the future. I've used hundreds of the old 12773's without any problem or fuss assembling them. I would definitely not recommend these 703 boxes.
1,I have to keep the batteries out of this thing otherwise they will run down within days even if the unit is kept off.  That means I use it very infrequently. Had I known this, I wouldn't have bought it.
1,It's a good reasonably priced printer with excellent results. Good quality on printed sheets and it will duplex, It prints excellent photos without having to change cartridges.		On the down side, the driver doesn't retain your preferences. It defaults to 8.5x11 plain paper. You have to change the settings to print a 4x6 photo.  Come back 5 minutes later to print another 4x6 and the printer has defaulted to 8.5x11 again.		If the objective of the design was to consume ink and annoy customers, the MX922 checks all the boxes. It takes a very long time to print the first sheet it forces you to buy ink you don't need. It won't print black and white if any of the color tanks are low. That's ABSURD!		One other annoying thing. If you register your warranty Cannon will spam you non-stop to buy another printer or more cartridges. Total pain in the tail and they refuse to let you unsubscribe.		In short - Good Hardware, marginal software, truly EVIL marketing department.
1,This worked fine for a year, then started getting fast spots and no colors. After changing one suddenly blue worked for 3 pages the scattered. When through head cleaning, head soaking over and over again.  It work work fine half the page then get lines. I said the hack with it and ordered a new printer
1,This toner didn't last 8 months, and I hardly use a printer anymore! For the last 5 years, I've averaged about 14 months per toner. My printer usage has gone down a lot the last year, so I expect it to last even longer. This toner was very light and hard to read from day 1. It's now flashing the "toner very low" message. I'll try a different one next time.
1,Disappointing, the top broke off
1,Cork tiles are fine, but the adhesive squares are horrible
1,Was not what I expected.
1,I purchased this replacement lamp for my Sony 50" television . I was really excited when I received it and the I automatic threw away all the packaging(garbage day).  Here's the problem, after 15 minutes I heard a pop and the replacement lamp  literally exploded in the television. There was no damage to the television but I had to eat the replacement lamp; because I did not have the packaging to return it. :) Well! as they say you get what you pay for. I will have to reorder and get another one; maybe, a little more expensive.
1,it was damaged so I returned it.
1,This says its birthday cards, but only half were birthday cards. The other half were sympathy cards.  My fault for not open the packet until after the return date.
1,I'm a second grade teacher. Needless to say, I sharpen A LOT of pencils. I knew I shouldn't go cheap on a sharpener so I invested the money into purchase a solid sharpener. It worked fine the 1st year but I did have my students use the primary jumbo pencils to avoid not having so many broken pencils. Those pencils are hard to find so I had my students use regular size pencils the following year. I started having problems a few months into the 2nd year of having this. The pencils sharpened but very unevenly. But worse than that, it would sharpen and then break in the middle of the sharpening (weird). I've tried cleaning it out but didn't help. Very unhappy.
1,When I first got this scale I loved it.  But after using it for some time I've realized that it is extremely inconsistent.  I've had mornings where I weigh myself first thing, have a cup of coffee, and get back on the scale to find I've "gained" more than two pounds.  Unfortunately I don't trust it any longer.  Why go through the effort of wearing their FitBit thing and tracking your food if you can't reliably see if you're gaining or losing weight?
1,Maybe I just don't know how to match the correct amount of ground coffee beans or grind them the right size or press them in firmly enough, but it just was not producing the results that I wanted. The idea of saving money was great, but I just couldn't get the damn thing to work for me. I had small coffee grounds in my espresso, the taste was horrible and definitely not anywhere close to the original packets. But again, there are just way too many variables to make this work right. If you are a coffee bean pro and know your beans and are careful to measure and experiment with various techniques, go for it. If you just wanted to save money, but don't really have the skill set to make this work, save your money on this product and spend it on more Nespresso capsules!
1,This seller has officially smeared the German brand for me. Originally I was deciding between Pilot and Lamy. I bought two Pilot fountain pens at the same time which worked wonderfully. This Lamy was impossible. No matter how I tried it, it simply didn't work. Well, in this sense, I really owe the seller a big thank-you. Thanks to you, I don't think I will ever try buying Lamy again.
1,Admittedly we are doing some heavy shredding of old business records.  Machine is interesting in that it chugs along and pulls 12 sheets while sounding like a chugging old car barely making it up the hill.  After about 30 days it failed; motor runs freely, but it sounds like a stripped gear or bad drive belt.  Worst thing is when I contacted Amazon support, which is usually great, they abdicated all responsibility since it was slightly over 30 days.  Their response was they could find no warranty, and I should contact the manufacturer.  Luckily, I bought a Square Trade warranty which I haven't yet attempted to use.  I replaced this item with a heavier Staples brand unit which is the best I have used.  The basket actually catches the shredding and minimizes shreds on the floor.
1,Do not stick
1,The distance range on this phone set is pretty good, but I do have to say the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired  many times, there is a small hum in the background no matter which phone or where you may be using the phones, and many times the caller sounds like they are far away.  And before some of you comment, yes, I have checked other electronics  and unplugged and plugged away  to see if they were the ones interfering as well as moving the base unit to other areas of the house.  Ive also tried the phones in a different house as an experiment and had the same issues.		While the programming of the phones was as expected, and the weight / feel of the phones is fine, I would give this set a pass based upon the humming noise and sound problems mentioned above.
1,I was expecting a nice and soft memory foam.  However, this is very hard and kinda hurt my wrist.  I definitely would not recommend it or buy it again.
1,I'm going back to purchasing a proper toner cartridge for my HP laser printer after having a terrible experience with the re-manufactured one I bought.	I constantly received pages of black bars across many pages causing reprints and wasting reams of paper.	Also, the roller had a divot in it which caused marks 3 or 4 times per page, I assume because somehow a staple got caught in the roller.	I recommend not using this product. It was poor quality and a TOTAL waste of money.
1,This is a terrible product.  I was able to get the very first page to laminate correctly.  But the laminating paper was barely wide enough to cover the paper.  It left less than 0.1 inches of clearance on each side.  After the very first page, every subsequent page came out crooked and not entirely laminated.  I tried readjusting the paper guide and it did not help.  Even though the paper lined up between the guide, every page still came out crooked with part of the paper outside the laminated area.  If I had paid for this product I would return it immediately.  Since I didn't, I'm dumping it in the trash.
1,The size is deceiving. There really is not much room inside. Too heavy to return, so I have to keep it I guess.
1,Initially I felt that this was a fine product.  However, since that time I have had constant problems with it in that each time I stamp a check the stamp stays stuck in the deployed position and I have to whack it on the desk to get it to retract.
1,Incredibly overpriced!!!!  Don't order.  You can get the entire pen for cheaper!
1,I am a new purchaser.  my printer has an error message "Black cartridge low" on this new cartridge.  i will repost a follow up if this seller makes good on my purchase and replaces this cartridge.  In my business, an ink cartridge generally lasts me at least 4 months.  I make it a point to use dark blue on most of my printing in order to preserve the black ink.  There is no way this cartridge was full.  I have posted for a return/replacement
1,I really wanted to like this product. I even did until I had to reposition the pad. The adhesive stuck to part of the desk when I moved it...and I am having a hard time now removing it. The glue now is discolored because of lint being caught in it..on a white desk. My arm hair also catches in the glue making it annoying. The mousepad can most certainly be repositioned, but be wary that the glue will stay behind.
1,This did not do well fore me.the corner lock brake so easy
1,crap
1,THE WORST PRINTER I EVER BOUGHT.  WOULD NOT GO ON BOTH MY MACS.
1,Very misleading, the description says various colors and size. These are all SMALL. I need small, medium and large clips. Look elsewhere unless you want all small clips
1,I have used this product in my first grade classroom for 10 weeks and it is already falling apart. The slots are not constructed firmly enough and continue to fall into the slots below. Paper use only, nothing else can be kept in slots. I can't see myself being able to use this for another school year. It was easy to construct, but took some time to do it.
1,Too small.  Not worth the money.
1,Updated - 6 months in.		I ***ing hate this thing. It will work reliably for two weeks, then reliably fail you. Then it's back to the 3-hour routine of useless troubleshooters, useless documentation, useless utilities, useless downloads. I have put a fist-shaped hole in my desk because of this thing.		I don't change settings. I do the same thing with it every day. There is no reason that this thing should work so poorly. It's too late to return it.
1,I am totally disgusted with this Canon 3-in-1 monochrome printer.  I bought this 1 year ago, end of June, and it broke on me already!!  Please understand that I have used this rarely to print a copy.  I never once used the FAX machine, nor did I ever need to copy anything on the copier.  I haven't even finished using the starter cartridge that came installed with it, and less than 500 sheets of paper because half of the paper is still in the package!!  I purchased an extra cartridge/toner complete set just to be sure I'd have it on hand when the "starter cartridge" ran out someday.  I turned it on a few days ago and it lighted up, and about 2 minutes later, when I was ready to hit "print" I realized it had gone dark again.  Not unusual because it has an energy saver mode that shuts down when not in use.  So, I hit the start button again, to "wake it up" and nothing happened.  Zilch.  Nada.  Nothing.  Of course, the "window" to return it was apparently on August 1, 2014.  I guess Canon didn't expect it to last even a month.  I'm retired and can't afford to support corporations that cheat me.  NOT a happy customer with Canon printers. To be fair, in the short time it did work, it made excellent copies when printing coupons from my computer.	Additional notes:  I was able to return the never opened box of toner/drum to Amazon when I requested help on "chat" and was only charged a 15% restocking fee due to the window being closed for so long.  I had also purchased a Square Trade 2 year warranty and will be refunded for the full amount once they receive my broken one.  Definitely 5 stars for their customer service!
1,After a little use the pens dry up.
1,Price was excellent. Prompt Shipment. When it came time to replace a cartridge, my printer would not recognize it. I tried 3 different cartridges and then proceeded with a return to Amazon.	I have a Brother MFC-J450DW printer that uses LC101 or LC103 cartridges.
1,ty
1,This color doesn't last 500 pages (one ream of paper) and I print on quick print.  Too expensive for the product not lasting one ream of paper.  Unfortunately I am not going to purchase a new printer now, so I am forced to use the product.  It is too much of a pain to return the cartridge for the return program.
1,Most of these markers dried out within the first two weeks.  Not a good deal.
1,Out of four orders, 4 cartridges leaked all over my hands, 2 yellow and 1 magenta did not work at all and ruined dozens of sheets of 80lb. card stock trying, and I tossed them into the garbage rather than box and return them - for the price of the originals, it is not worth my time and effort.  The cost of the genuine HP 920XL is prohibitive, but in the long run is probably worth the expense.  I will simply try to find a less expensive means of creating my gifts and greetings.	R. Koenig
1,I don't know why, but these post-its are not as sticky as regular post-its, or even knock off brands.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the paper or what, but they are good for one or two stickings, then they won't stick again.  And they have a hard time sticking at all to a refrigerator with a textured surface.  I get these when I need a "filler item" to get to $25 free shipping, but I may have to find something else...they are not that good.
1,I am very disappointed with this printer.  I have had it for a year but after the first month it would only print one project at a time.  My projects are one page in length.  I need to reboot the desk top in order for a different project to be printed.  I called tech support and they were not able to correct the problem.  My PC has worked well with other printers.  I have used the scan and copy feature which works ok.  I would not buy another Lexmark. I should have sent it back.
1,A good idea on paper that became a poor design.  The heavy duty plastic support pieces are fine and easily adjustable from legal to letter.  Expect to draw blood using a pliers to snap off the support bar ends to make them shorter. I finally put them in my vise and snapping the metal was much easier without bending the arm in the process. Then came the part where you put the support bar ends into the plastic supports.  Tough and dangerous. Use a cloth on the opposite end to push them in and be sure they are in tight or the whole thing will fall apart on you.  Will look for something else before buying another set of these.
1,These were rejected by my HP printer
1,This is sort of a bitter sweet product. Its cheap so that makes it a fair buy, but the toner doesn't seem to last that long. I just put in new cartridges and it seems I get about 50 pages of color and then I get a low ink warning. I don't know if it this company or the HP printer that sucks up the ink. I think I need to invest in a new technology printer that gets more efficiency out of the ink but I just ordered two more so when they run out, I think I will be in the market for a new printer.		Update: 2.10.2016		I just put in two new cartridges and after 10 pages, the low ink indicator came on. Sorry, but you expect your ink to last longer than 10-20 pages. I would recommend going with a different re manufacturer if this is all you get out if it.
1,Before buying a set of Epson Inkjet printing several sheets of A4 paper already failed, after re-purchase a set just print two A4 paper: Black Inkjet already exhausted: To do this it had to add black Inkjet.
1,Didnt come with the pocket chart.  Had to later buy separately.
1,Not for those who press hard
1,I tried this cutter and found it to be extremely annoying to use.  First, the ruler at the top is useless to me as someone who measures in inches, not centimeters.  The bottom of the ruler is centimeters.  That part is closest to the paper.  The inch measurements are on the top of the ruler and when trying to use those, the centimeter markings are in your line of vision.  If you are trimming to a standard size, like 4x6, you can use the markings on the main cutting platform, but it won't be very precise because those markings are quite thick.		The guide piece on the left side doesn't slide very well.  It skips out of the groove and is generally annoying to use.  I ditched that right away.  Also, the top part where you would line up your paper to get it straight is a curved surface with a channel below, for the left guide mentioned.  The paper easily slides up onto the curve or down into the channel, making it impossible to use that to ensure straightness.		The protective plastic on the right that you slide the paper under is not positioned well.  It's an inch or so away from the blade.  So, if you want to trim a small strip of paper just a little, you have to put your fingers between the plastic guide and the blade, making it fairly unsafe.		I was also not impressed with the laser.  Perhaps it needed adjusting after shipping.  It didn't seem to produce the straight, exact cut that it was supposed to.		The one good thing I can say is that the blade is sharp.  I didn't try cutting multiple pages.  I need a trimmer for scrapbooking so mostly I'm cutting one page at a time.  This is not a good trimmer for scrapbooking and for precise cuts.  I'm returning it.
1,I don't print much at all, maybe few pages per year, thats it.	Yet this thing started to give me fade on one end of the drum.	I guess these things are not per USE rated but AGE rated.	Design to brake after about 4 years of hardly any use.
1,I like the Precise brand of pens.  But this particular pen isn't as smooth to write with as some of the other Precise brand pens I have bought in the past	They are fine, but I won't buy them again.		11/04/16:  I have wanted to re review this pens.  I ended up tossing the pens because, even though I hadn't used them much,  the ink just wouldn't flow.		I tossed them out.		Don't buy these pens.  A waste of money.
1,I ordered thsi product for our small office.  It arrived quickly, but we were unable to open it as we were remodeling the office and have limited space. we faced delays, and were unable to open and use the product until October, several weeks after the return deadline.  I was not concerned as I ordered a NEW product and never had a problem ordering through Amazon.  When we opened the box, the product was visably broken..a piece of the machine was broken off and there was shredded paper in the bin.  It si too late to return the product but I am extremely disappointed in Amazon.
1,I made a huighe mistake and bought this paper thinking it was white - it was clearly labeled but I did not read the "Tan"word - did not return it as it was my mistake.
1,These binders are poor quality and did not ship well.  Two of the binders were crushed on the binding.  You can get better quality binders at Costco.  Again, this is one of those products that is not worth going through the hassle of returning.
1,Ink smeared, so it was returned to the vendor.
1,MYSELF AND TWO OTHER MEN COULD NOT FIGURE HOW THIS PHONE WORKED!  NO PLACE TO CONNECT THER JACK AND OTHER PROBLEMS TOO.  DON'T BUY THIS--SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT!!!
1,Looking for relief for my tailbone - this seemed like a nicer approach / reasonably well made and upon initial appearance looks very good. Problem is the foam or actual cushioning material - not dense at all, collapses in no time. I would only recommend this for a child or person under 140lbs.
1,Was not packaged and arrived damages. I took too long to open it and discover that the toner ran out like water when it was tipped only a little.
1,Worked perfectly the first few times I used it. I then put it in storage for a few years. Went to try and laminate something and while it heats up, the roller doesn't turn making it useless.
1,We bought the original set of phones years ago. We needed to replace one of the hand sets. The replacement cost nearly as much as the entire set. Which is stupid and a rip off. But we needed the phone so once again corporate greed has the public right where it wants them, the public being the true citizens of the United states of America (despite what the Supreme Court says, Corporations are not citizens as far as I am concerned).  So buy this product if you will.
1,At three skins including shipping from the evil empire, the pen is priced just about right.  How this is any sort of "defensive tool" is beyond me.  The top has a pyramid shaped point which might (?) pop a car window should you be that one in a gajillion persons trapped in a car underwater, so maybe that's something.  The barrel of the pen seems to be sturdy metal, probably aluminum.  Alas, the knurling texture is only on the top half, so the part you actually hold while writing is rather slippery.  The twist retraction mechanism feels sloppy, and I foresee breakage before long.  The pocket clip is robust.  As some have observed, the very top point unscrews should you want to remove the clip.		A Parker-style ballpoint cartridge makes writing acceptably smooth.		For three beans, it's worth buying for a ballpoint (but who writes with ballpoints?  Anyone with taste uses a fountain pen with bottled ink.)  If the price goes to five or higher, just pass.  Also just pass if you want this for "defense" purposes.  That's a nonstarter.  Also pay attention to the seller's six week delivery estimate.  They're not kidding.  No tracking available, and shipping is evidently by pack mule.
1,They don't stay stuck.
1,Too bad it doesn't come in different sizes. This is designed for a petite person. I'm a 180 lb man and it was much too narrow. It has edges, like a bucked seat, that cut into my thighs. Had to return it, but got a prompt refund.
1,I write this review 10 months after purchase. Please note the headset audio became unstable, fading in and out and making the set useless. I ordered a replacement headset which remedied the situation. I find it incredibly irking that a premium priced product such as this would fail in less than one year of light usage (about two hours per day on weekdays only over the 10 months).		Next time I will look for an alternative supplier and hope they have a better product
1,Did not last very long.
1,Based on the pictures on amazon, this product appeared bigger than actual size.	When I got it, it was too small and useless.	Now its somewhere laying in my garage.	Wasnt any benefit to me
1,Doesn't print on a home printer. Gets distorted so images are in the wrong place.
1,All of the Monteverde rollerball refills I have bought in local stores worked poorly.		I suspected that maybe store stock refills might just be too old and dry to write well (Pink and purple are sure to be slow sellers).  I ordered a pack from Amazon, and those were bad too.		But maybe Amazon's stock was also old, so I sent them back, not to Amazon but directly to Monteverde.  They replaced the refills, and the new ones are just as bad.		Sadly, these horrid refills are wasting warehouse space in many retailers.  I hope Monteverde eventually goes under so someone competent can take their place.
1,Unfortunately this was not compatible with our pitney bowes meter it kept causing an error so once I ordered the original pitney bowes cartridge it worked just fine.
1,The color works but the black does not. This is the first time I've ever gotten ink when the orange plastic that protects the points was missing. They replaced it. so . . . .	I no longer own this printer.
1,I have a lower back bulging disc and everything makes my lower back hurt. I bought this hoping that it would make me be able to sit and not be in pain afterwards. My husband broke his back twice and also suffers with lower back pain. It didn't help either of us. As a matter of fact, it made us have more pain. Did not like it.
1,I've used these cartridges for the past couple of years. At first they worked great. The most recent ones I have received did not work well. They only print a small number of pages before the sensor says they are low on toner. I am able to get some more pages out of it, but not nearly the page yield they say they have and have had in the past.
1,I had purchased this product on 7 prior occassions. I was always the same package with the curly-haired boy on the front, and it was always a "100 sheet" package.		The price was good, but the shipping was outrageous. No "free shipping" as on other prior orders, but a mandatory price of over $20.00 .		I ordered 10 packages, from UNIQUE PHOTO, and immediately started using the paper when it arrived. After a few packages, I noticed that these packages were "50 sheets" per package, not "100 sheets".		I contacted UNIQUE PHOTO, who offered to refund the money for the unused packages, but I would again have to pay their outrageous shipping fee.		I countered with the offer of settlement for an additional 4 packages of the 50 sheet paper. They refused, stating that "Amazon" would not allow them to make such a compromise.		I don't like the, in my opinion "deceptive packaging", by Canon, and I don't like, in my opinion the deceptive handling of the problem by UNIQUE PHOTO.		I hope this critique keeps others from making my same mistake.
1,I returned it twice, thinking that it was just a lemon...but this brand is not good.  Find another brand instead.
1,Worked fine for a few days, now no longer prints on-line. Paper tray is loaded,but receive error message	That paper tray is in need of paper or must add paper to manual feed. I checked tray for fit and paper amount, but still receive error message. Did not see troubleshooting repair on Brother trouble shooting site.
1,No pockets inside.  So with this product can not carry around.  The design is very flawed!  I can see things falling out in the future.  It like the old fashion things I saw in school use for filing on counter top.  Sorry I would not recommend this for purchase.
1,Nice small stand for putting a small Display on top of a cable box, so the cable box can breath.	If it had come with the correct hardware, or correct bored holes that matched the screws, I would have given it 5 starts.	The screws were flat on top, and didn't have a V under the head, the screws were flat on the underside of the head.	The board had holes that were ready for normal countersink Flat head screws , screws that have a V on the underside of their flat heads.	Thankfully I have buckets of odds and ends of screws, so had to go digging for 4 of the right size / length screws that would fit the V countersink in the board.		They either have to get the right screws, or get their machining correct for the holes on the board to match the screws they are shipping
1,Returned it. One part was getting stuck and locked in unopened position. And it had huge hand prints all over it which means I probably got someone's returned item.
1,This may be good for holding a piece of paper to a wall, but nothing more than that. Very weak and a complete waste of money. The other reviews failed me.
1,Knockoff or ridiculously old.  The pad is hardly gel.  It crackles and crunches like cellophane stuffed into a fabric casing.  There is definitely no "gel" in that "gel-pad".  Don't buy it, save the money and buy something better. Too bad... it could be nice if it was the real deal.
1,I just took delivery of this box and none of the dimensions are correct.  It is much too small for the purposed I purchased it for.  It is advertised as a Vaultz Locking DVD and Video Game Lock Box, 9.25 x 7.25 x 9.75 Inches, Black (VZ01047).  In reality, it is 8.5 x 6.25 x 9.5.  What is even worse is that I now see that this product has been on Amazon for years with the same complaints and no one fixed the incorrect description.  Incompetence?  Maybe they don't care because most people will let it slide.  Trust me, this is NOT the product advertised.
1,These envelopes are perfect EXCEPT, the flap won't stick!  It's so irritating to pay more for self-adhesive envelopes and they don't even stick.  I just started using this box and am considering returning them!
1,Five Star is great!....just don't buy this one.		Mine was at least 10 years old or something. The sticker was glued on or something. You could tell it was really old!	This was my 10th Five Star Composition Book, so I would know.	The price is ridiculous too! Almost $10?!??... I can buy one at Target for $3!!.... and it's not a thousand years old!!		The only reason I bought my 10th one here was because I was in need of a green-colored one.
1,I had high hopes for this printer but I am about to return my 2nd one. Both printers have the same problem. My print jobs average about 75-200 pages. I have yet to have a larger print job where it does not misfeed a page, print about 20% of the text on the very top edge of one page, insert a blank page, and print the balance of the text on the next page. Not only does this look unprofessional, in a legal environment this is a deal breaker.		I now have to manually thumb through every page printed to make sure it doesn't have one of those misfeeds. Given both printers do the same thing with about the same frequency, I have to conclude it is a design flaw. My prior printer was a Brother DCP-9049CN which only had 2 misfeeds after tens of thousands of pages printed.		Another glaring flaw with this printer is that it does not have a paper or envelope bypass feed. In other words, if you want to print a FedEx adhesive label or an envelope you have to remove the paper cartridge and insert the paper in the cartridge. For a printer designed for office use, to me this is a big oversight. I could have lived with dealing with the missing paper feed slot, but not with the misfeed problem.		Another issue which may or may not bother some people is that the printed pages end up facing up so people walking by can read the top page sitting on the paper holder. This could result in a privacy issue for some businesses. It bothers me because I'm used to using printers that end up with the printed page face down. So now when I print multiple documents that are part of one print job I have to send to the printer the last document first, or else the job will be backwards and out of order. For me it made more sense to send what should be on top of the print job first, and what should be on the bottom of the stack last. Nothing you can't get used to quickly but something to also consider.		Now I'm back to the drawing board looking for an economical and fast printer. As soon as I find one my 2nd HP Pro 8630 is being returned.		Bottom line is that this printer is fine for small print jobs. But there are many less expensive printers that are good for small print jobs, so I can't recommend this one until HP addresses the paper feed problem.
1,The colors are not as beautiful as the pictures. Poor Quality
1,Shipped quickly, but it's ugly, bulky and doesn't perform its sole function very well. I practically have to put all of my weight on it to get it to punch a hole, it sticks and I have come very close to cutting myself on it a couple of times.
1,The sides of the paper fold up when exiting the laser printer. Drives me nuts!
1,just bought them and nothing prints.  very frustrating for the amount of money spent
1,Edit: I'm taking 2 stars off because after a year and a half of use, the cap of this pen refuses to stay on.  Ink stains on my clothing attest to the damage from this flaw.  Where the Al Star can apparently be repaired by removing part of the cap assembly, this one cannot, and I feel this is a serious engineering flaw.  The somewhat weak balance (too light) and lack of durability of the plastic barrel cost it another star.  Do not buy this pen, if you want a Lamy go for the better-made Al Star.		I love the Lamy nibs (especially the bolder medium sizes) for their silky smooth writing, durability, and solid ink flow.  The clips on these pens are quite solid too.  Unfortunately, the ABS plastic body feels cheap and flimsy (too light) versus the more solid aluminum bodies on Lamy's Al Star line. Yes, they've textured the plastic finish for good grip, but the balance is off.		In my opinion, the extra $10 for the Al Star is worth it (I can also vouch that in daily use they will survive a ridiculous amount of punishment, including multiple times where they fell out of my pocket onto concrete).
1,This product is terrible I thought I was rating the one I replaced it with. So if you see 5 stars I really meant -5
1,DIDN'T WORK. I TOSSED IT AFTER A COUPLE OF TRIES. CHEAP
1,I have arthritis in my hands, and was looking for a wide pen. I failed to scroll down the description paragraph to see that these pens are gigantic, nearly 7 inches tall. So not what I was expecting. They are too big to be comfortable for myself. I gave them out as gifts.
1,In grad school. Love flags. They came in a zillion colors! But don't stick well. :(
1,I thought this was for the small binder.  Well they weren't.
1,Had to return, defective phones, needed only 2 rings on in-coming calls to make my Bluetooth system work right...The answering machine rang 5-6 times when set on two-ring setting...had to return
1,Cheap.  Not as cute as I thought these would be.
1,Defective from the start. Installed new fresh batteries and tried to sharpen the first pencil. Nothing happened. Apparently, the mechanism is jammed up tightly. I can't even turn the cutter with my fingers. I suppose they don't test these at the factory. I returned it for a refund.
1,See www.canoninkjetprintersettlement.com. Although Canon denies the claim, there's no denying the numerous occurrences of this problem. I experienced this exact print head problem on my 1 1/2 year old Pixma MG712 this past June rendering it completely inoperable. A call to Canon resulted in the suggestion to send them the printer to be diagnosed and repaired, all at my expense, when they were already fully aware of this reoccurring problem.  To add insult to injury, they referred me to their "Loyalty Program" so I could purchase a new printer. Canon's refusal to accept any responsibility for problems with the print head would imply they will continue to use it in their printers. Good luck.
1,looks cheap
1,item received did not match item description want moisture resistant received plain old paper bubble mailers
1,Too thick.  will not buy again.
1,I would recommend you to look for another PANASONIC Cordless phone. It is OK, but not the best. Try the black ones...
1,These will scratch your shelf. Would be OK for say a college student with cement block and planks. Or anyone to whom messed up finish on the shelves is not an issue. The ones with felt/velour on the bottom costs only a little bit more.
1,Not recommended at all. Labels would not fit properly in Dymo 4xl, labels had bubbles in them, they wouldn't cut properly and even got all twisted up in my printer and stuck inside where it prints from. Ruined my Dymo 4xl because I tried saving money. Don't waste your time or money. Return process has been fairly simple so far which is nice though.
1,Wow, has H-P lost their mojo with advanced calculators. Main complaint is that this model, as with many of their graphing calculators, requires too many keystrokes to arrive at answers, especially units conversion. The cyan color legends are so faint they are almost illegible unless you have a 3X or greater magnifying glass.
1,didn't work for me, printer rejected them
1,Returned.
1,While the phone works and looks identical to what you would get from AT&T or Staples, it is not!  On the back it only has a phone jack port and is missing the data port.  I don't think I can blame this one on Amazon as the numbers and the box are identical and there are no pics of the back of the phone.  I went to a local store and had them open the box.  It was correct.
1,arrived with scratches on it (??)  and broke down pretty quickly.  it's also flimsy so you have to hold it with one hand while you're sharpening.  I've since ordered an x-acto one which is heavier so I can sharpen a pencil using only one hand.
1,Very tiny tags. Looks cheap. Not sure I would have ordered it if I had known it's going to be this small...
1,The Epson printer won't recognize it, so it doesn't print. It was disappointing.
1,Pro . They are a fine point pen.		Con . At times it is more trouble that they are worth to make ink flow. The pens ink stops a lot and most time is impossible to start.
1,This laptop desk might be ok but if you are counting on the description here, be prepared to be disappointed. There are things listed more than once and a design flaw you won't realize until you use this desk. The micro bead filled cushions are listed in 4 of the lines of description. It's really creative how they make these cushions seem like a different feature with each mention. The microbeads filling the cushions are listed in 2 lines without mentioning these beads will likely be the reason you'll have to throw the desk away eventually. The cushions of all these type desks will wear eventually and when yours does, you'll realize what a terrible idea it is to fill anything with these microbeads. When you least expect it, you'll start to see tiny white specks building up all around you. At some point it will dawn on you the white specks you can't quite get rid of or stop from coming back, are these microbeads. They make a mess and are a mess. So seeing them listed as a feature 4 times is gall if nothing else.	I'm not sure what these are: "2 built-in storage compartments for organizing accessories." The best guess is the molded indentations next to the "handle." If that is what this describes, then I can't find anything to be the "Deep organizer trays' listed at the end of the description. All of this said, this is not such a bad desk except for what it does not have. The missing part is a cushion or something to keep the computer from sliding down the front of the desk. I've never had a laptop desk without this. Although $17.99 is not expensive, the description seems to be much ado about nothing.
1,The blade in the mouth of the device is too small to do anything other than open an envelop.  It will not cut the plastic that your purchases are encased in.  The lower blade only sticks out a very short distance and is ok the cut the plastic on a package of meat, but nothing stronger than that.  A real disappointment.  I bought it to help cut through the plastics that everything seems to be encased in these days.  It won't cut the packing tape on boxes either.  A waste of money.
1,Did not provide quality printing.  Threw them away and went back to HP cartridges.
1,When I was younger I used to be a fine scale modeler so I am very familiar with the types of glue on the market.  Zap super glue is my favorite but when I saw this listed I decided to give it a whirl.  I tried this glue on a few simple repairs (being a father you learn the glue and duct tape are your best friends) with lackluster results.  One of my repairs was to glue a leather flap down on a pouch and after attaching a tension clamp for sixteen hours the bond did not hold.  Ditto on plastic and metal.  So if you need something to stick other than cardboard don't get stuck with this glue.
1,SIGNATURE BOX IS IN THE EDGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE MAKIN SO INCONVENIENCE FOR PEOPLE TO SIGN, FINGER PRINT BOX IS EVEN CONFUSION....I DONT BUY THIS DESIGN AGAIN.
1,Top of desk was scratched in several areas. Additionally, there were a few areas missing the fakey-wood sticker. The desk has these clunky feet that you are supposed to screw up and down to make the desk even, but why are the legs uneven in the first place? So annoyed that this must now be disassembled and packed up!
1,one star due to scam...
1,This is lovely paper with a perfect texture. Unfortunately, the ink on my brother laser printer does not adhere well to it, so my documents look absolutely awful. This is not a problem with the printer. Definitely the paper. I notice that another reviewer has had the same problem with it, so it isn't just me.
1,After purchase from a local store in late November 2007, I followed the written instructions for setup.  Software installation would stop at 96%; hit cancel and it all uninstalls.  Spent hours on phone with HP tech support (Philippines, I think).  At one point they took remote control of my computer for 3 1/2 hours, told me to reboot and call back if there still was a problem.  There was.		After repeated uninstalls and reinstalls was able to get printer to function, but not in duplex mode.  Tech support personnel were polite and patient, wait time was short, language and understanding was sometimes a problem.		Scanning would not work using their software, however, I could scan pictures using third party programs.  The tech support guy thought that I "should live with that".  OCR and text scanning never would work.		More phone calls and installs and uninstalls, got it to print; intermittently in duplex mode.  Then had numerous error messages that popped up at random times and often would not cancel.  I made numerous requests to replace the printer and/or speak to a supervisor or engineer.  All requests were refused.		Now I tried email tech support (online chat never worked).  Received copius pages of links and suggestions on various alternate methods to install and reinstall.  Spent hours detailing the problems and continued to receive duplicate suggestions to fix the problems, none of which worked.		Also went on internet and googled the various error messages and software and installation problems.  Found out that most of these problems with this series of HP printers was very common and that there were few solutions offered.		Fortunately the store had a 90 day return policy and I packed up everything and took it back for a full refund.		Remember, save your boxes and packing material until all your warranties expire!
1,Will never order "recycled" ink cartridges again!  Black ink made a mess of my Canon MX320!  At first I kept getting the 'low ink' notice within days of installing.  Now the ink has dripped out and is all over the inside of my printer!  What a mess!  I made the mistake of buying the two-pack because I WILL NOT be using the second cartridge.  I print less than 100 pages a year so there's no way I used it up already.  Plus...I had them 'on hand' for a couple months before using because we are 20+ miles from any store I could buy a replacement at.		Never again.	No freakin' way.
1,Too small. Smaller than what it looked on the picture. Had to return it
1,.I did love this printer but it is not one year old and the black ink will no longer print. I have used printers for 25 years so yes I have did all troubleshooting..NOT HAPPY
1,Received this last night & was really looking forward to trying oil paint on my painted stones, BUT, when trying this for the FIRST TIME on a previously painted stone, it basically exploded with paint.  (you can see what happened).		I will try other colors & hope it doesnt make a disastrous mess like this just did. :(	(Will update but right now I am not impressed)
1,Lock broke first time I used it. Does not lock.
1,Stamps grey. Even when I add more ink to it, it does not cover well.  I have to stamp about 5 times to cover up the info.
1,Poor quality the Magnetic Dry Ease Refrigerator Calendar it's of great quality.	This one come w/ bubble making difficult to used on the daily and Amazon did not want to send a replacement.  I am getting trying of having issues like this, so I am thinking on closing my account, so I won't buy anything here. Will buy may a few things before closing my account.
1,did not fit my stapeler
1,This tape is very thin.  I can hardly get it off the roll without it tearing and it tears easily even after it has been placed on whatever I am taping.  I thought it was a good deal but it actually isn't because you have to use 2-3 layers of tape to make sure the item is securely closed.  I wouldn't buy it again.
1,First of all, it took time, effort and research to get my new Brother to accept this cartridge.  It was a real problem.  Then, after all the time it took, it only produced 600 pages.  That's a huge difference in what this vendor stated it would do.  It arrived with ink 'dust' spilled all over the cartridge when I opened it and also left ink stains in different places on my pages.  Not well done at all.  I won't buy from them again.
1,I had a previous gel wrist rest that was much more comfortable than this one. This one is more like putting my wrists on hard rubber than a soft firm gel like substance. It does not have much give to it. It is actually to the left of my computer underneath some papers as I type! That should tell you how I think about it!
1,okay product	I don't recommended this thing	it is okay for as a mechanical percil but the advertised function of rotating the lead??? not working
1,I use a lot of these sheet protectors for filing away magazine articles and design photos, so I chose these because they are acid free and "archival safe".  I'm trying several types and brands.  These are not up to par.  They are being sold as heavyweight but they are very light and flimsy, and they are not even the thinnest ones they sell.  The equivalent made and sold by Staples is much better (except that the Staples Clear are really more frosted).  The sheets are clear and there is no fogging or spots, but overall they're just too flimsy.  I know Avery makes an even heavier version, but not sure if I want to buy from them again, after their marketing of these ones.  Why don't you just make one version and make them well.
1,I get error messages on the drum OFTEN, and they started almost right away. The toner cartridge leaked on the edges, spattering black spots on my printouts. Those went away as soon as I went back to a genuine Brother cartridge. Now I just need to get a new drum again. Genuine Brother next time!
1,I bought these to use with my Dymo label printer.  The labels print fine, but the adhesive on these labels is terrible.  It adheres only for a short time and then starts peeling away.  I don't know about other Dymo Letratag labels, but these are useless.
1,For some reason, unlike all the other Sharpies, these are not transparent and therefore of little use in coloring.
1,BUYER BEWARE.... THIS BUYING DECISION HAS COST ME a bucket of $$ and time. They are not keeping up with technology especially Apple. Horrible. Just spent 4 hours on the phone and a remote session over the last three days and it is still not working as it should. ALSO, now you are forced to use the cloud they provide for a monthly fee, no longer an option which is unfair.
1,Terrible they don't mention in the description of these are actually used pens some of them you can even tell the wear on the outside of the pen but most of them don't write at all they're completely useless. Out of the batch of 50 I'd say approximately 10 pens actually worked.  Total waste of time and money would be great if the pens actually worked like they're supposed to but their old dried-up use pens that they're sending you repackage in a bag.
1,Very cute but extremely hard to remove from the backing and they do not stick very well
1,I've had this printer for a few months now.  Been impressed with other Brother products but this one falls short.  I wanted a simple, compact laser printer that could do duplex (two-sided) printing.  The 5340D provides fine print quality reasonably fast and quiet, but take the warnings from the other reviewers seriously when they say it warps paper and crinkles envelopes - I thought they were just being fussy.  Nope.  This machine really does have those problems - big time.		The paper curling is significant.  And no, it's not the paper (I've tried different brands and weights).  This issue can be a real headache if you decide to manual feed a printed page (for example when you want two-sided printing but from two different documents or web sites).  The printed page is so warped that its difficult to insert into the manual feeder and it sometimes causes a jam.  I've had several lasers but I have never seen a printer cause such extreme curling.		And the the way it mangles envelopes is plain unacceptable.  They come out curled (of course) with major wrinkles.  The machine must put off too much heat because the envelopes are somewhat sealed and need to be opened quickly before the glue dries them permanently shut.  I know there is a back exit that may avoid this problem, but like most owners, my printer is placed close to a wall so its really not convenient or even feasible to open a back door periodically.  Simply put, Brother really shouldn't claim this printer can handle envelopes.		So now ya know.  My advice - if you want a duplex printer that can handle envelopes too, wait for Brother to fix these flaws with their next version.
1,I guess I should have read the reviews  before purchasing this color set. The yellow cartridge was empty and we were low on others so we bought this set, and when we put in the yellow cartridge in it would not recognize it. This prompted me to run down to Office Max and purchase a yellow cartridge. We did replace magenta, so it's not like we can return the set when we have used one. Lesson learned.
1,I own 2 other Canon printers and decided to add a wireless printer.  I have been so satisfied with Canon products that I decided to go Canon again.  From the descriptions of this printer I thought it was just what I needed.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.		PROS:	First it is very easy to set up, but the positive stops there.		CONS:	It is EXTREMELY slow.	Only one paper holder that holds few sheets so you are constantly replenishing paper supply.	Quality of print both color and B&W are only so-so.  Not up to Canon's usual quality.	The "extender" that holds the paper when it comes out from printing is so short that it barely holds the paper before it drops on the floor.		I can see why the price is dropping rather quickly on this model.  Don't waste your money.  I do like Canon so much however that I am thinking about buying one of their other wireless models in hopes of better performance.
1,I usually use the PaperMate Flair, but saw these for a lesser price, and I normally love everything sharpie, so I gave them a chance. They go right through every type of paper I have!
1,Product was not clear that is was from Jan 2016- seconds 2016. I assumed bc it was a planner and was listed with agendas, etc that it would be starting August-2016-sept 2017 or so.	Now I have the option to use it for 4 months and buy another one or return it...	The inside and outside are nice that's why I'm giving it a 2 star.
1,In these computer, tablet, smartphone times, a big reason for buying this journal is to bring back the flavor of a different time. A time when there were no machine tools cranking these things out. Hand tooled leather, parchment paper, hand bound, decorated with carefully applied foil.		You're not going to get this for less than $20. But from the pictures I expected a reasonable facsimile. It's not. The antique look leather-like cover, looks neither like leather or anything approaching antique. The smooth pages have a design to appear like parchment don't feel at all like anything other than modern machine made paper, too carefully cut and printed to look old. The lines on each page are solid black, clean and even (not like the lighter appearance they have in the picture, since what one really wants is just light guidelines to help write evenly).		Put that all together and you have a modern looking product that you can easily purchase for half the price. If that's OK with you, this is still a nicely made journal. It is neither what I wanted or expected.		I might have given it another star. But the only other review gave it five, in a review that isn't a review at all. So I'm lowering the average to a more appropriate rating. If you buy this product and disagree, please post your review. Mine is more intended for potential customers to know what to expect, and perhaps consider other options.
1,Scanning quality is fine for the negatives that aren't curling, but the workflow is miserable. I have to babysit the scanner and re-click the application for every new negative. If a batch of 35mm negatives will take 20 minutes to scan, I have to sit there the entire time.		Pair this with the fact that 35mm binder holders hold 5 horizontally and 6 vertical, while the scanner holds 8 horizontally and 3 vertically, means that one roll of film requires 3 batches of scanning. It takes over an hour to scan one roll of 35mm and I have to keep clicking the mouse the entire time.		Negative holders do not prevent curling, but do have a translucent back that requires maintenance between scans to remove floating dust or hair.		My recommendations to the company are 1: Fix the software to work without a babysitter and 2: remove the translucent back to the original design.		For the negatives that manage to get scanned relatively flat, they look good.
1,I bought this printer in April of '08. It died today Oct. 17, 2008. I'd be much more upset if it was my only printer. Have not been happy from beginning because of problems with paper handling. Must use rear feed for anything other than 20# paper. Rear feed hard to use and inadequate paper guide leads to many misfeeds. Gave up on using front tray after a month because it kept jamming with it's limited use. Today I got messages there was a paper jam when there wasn't. Mechanisms began to sound horrible and print awful, then my paper did jam and won't clear.	A shocker a month ago: ran out of ink in one color. the printer then refused to do any printing at all and wouldn't even let me scan or fax when my task didn't need to use any ink.	I'm done with it. I don't even want an exchange if they offered it. I'm going back to HP and Brother.
1,It broke at the hook after 2 days use! The badge holder is fine, and I like the ability to store money or a credit card in the pocket behind it, but I really liked the hook on the lanyard. Oh well, I got another lanyard and was able to attach the ID to that.		The lanyard is pretty long. I had to tie a knot in the back or else it went past my waist! Probably best for tall people!
1,The flimsy metal-on-plastic zipper is very difficult for a child (or elderly adult) to manipulate.  The geometry of the zipper in its fully open position is in an angle that "locks" it open unless one removes the pocket from the binder to correct the angle.  Overall, this product was a waste of space and fuel to carry in container carts from China for dumping in USA.
1,This was a free sample but I received one rather then the four listed.  What I was mailed would normally be considered a very basic bare bones economy binder.  There was a heavy duty sticker but nothing and I mean NOTHING about this binder was heavy duty.  I know because I work with scores of binders on a daily basis.  Until I saw the sticker I actually thought a shipping error had occurred.  On top of the quality issues this is one of the noisiest binders I have ever used.  I think you would be better buying an economy  binder and at least get what you pay for.
1,I mean if you put globs of it on, it will stick (maybe) but not any where nearly as strong as I would think it should be for "extra strength." Regular liquid glue is so many times stronger. Not expensive but I still wasted over $4 on a product is useless to my projects.
1,As Brother replacement toner, it cost ~$80 for full set, in comparison to $220 by Brother. It is good for TEXT printing only, it does not deliver more than 5%, needed to fill areas. As a result there are lines (different shades) through the printing. The problem shows especially with the black (but exist in all the other colors).	Run test page, look for the colored squares, none is uniform (they have vertical lines through them)
1,Really cute BUT very very light weight and unsteady. I purchased the post it note kitty holder and it is heavy and sturdy so I expected the same of this tape dispenser. WRONG. Tho is is adorable, I have had to attach some velcro to the bottom of the dispenser and the shelf it is on. Very very dissapointed. I am making it work because its so darn cute.
1,did not work well
1,Like many others, I just cannot recommend this printer or any other Brother product. This is the second product from this manufacturer that I have owned. The first gave me multiple problems, even the second and third replacement units. That was many years ago and I had mostly forgotten the bad taste BROTHER left in my mouth. So when I saw this on sale at a great price, I couldn't resist.		BIG MISTAKE!  This thing started wrinkling copies almost from the start. When I went to take it back, I was told I bought it during the store's "Bargains with NO RETURN" sale. True but I gave it a try. I'll also never shop there again, mostly because they're out of business. (Imagine that-a store with terrible customer service out of business!) I have not had the same luck as others who claim to have solved the "unable to print an envelope" issue. My HP printer, and everyone of my previous 6 HP printers, printed envelopes without a whimper.		My Advice? Steer clear from Brother printers. They just don't get it. I don't think they ever will. From other comments here, it looks like Brother has answered consumer complaints with what I call the single-finger response. In other words, "If you don't like our product, tough. Go somewhere else."
1,cord has no slot to go intu so phone sits on a loose cord??? not good , do not buy. had to use Scotch tape on cord to keep in place,
1,AFTER A COUPLE WEEKS, THE SIDES WERE PRINTING VERY LIGHT, HAD TO REPLACE THEM WAY TOO SOON.
1,If you just need something for the most basic of boxing functionality, and never need to cut shorter pieces for affixing labels or sealing small packages, etc, this product may suit you.  If you print out paper labels, are sealing small boxes, padded mailers or polymailers, I'd look elsewhere, as it's aggravating, if not near impossible to cut a piece of tape shorter than about eight inches with this gun.  There's a lot of wasted tape, not only due to it's near inability to cut small pieces, but even when tearing off on larger boxes, you'll find yourself repeatedly cutting off a few inches more than you need, due to the impractical design.  The gun itself is about as well made in terms of materials as probably any other tape gun I've seen and includes a neoprene cushioned handle, which will be very subjectively appreciated:  short term benefits for people with large hands and/or who use the gun continuously all day, every day; but it's just something that's going to break down with sweat and use, and may make the grip uncomfortably thick for some.		Unfortunately, Scotch decided to recess the cutting blade with this design, so you can only tear the tape in a very restrictive/limited movement, which even "using it properly" as one positive reviewer noted,  it's harder to tear than traditional guns.  The benefit is that it's almost impossible to cut yourself with this gun - a virtual non-issue I know, except possibly when cleaning, if you're really careless.  I can only assume that Scotch couldn't come up with a more significant way of improving this age-old design, so this is what we're stuck with, seeing as that it seems to have become the most commonly carried tape gun in retail stores.  I imagine it may also be less susceptible to tape buildup between the points of the blade over time, but that doesn't typically become a problem for years of use in my experience, only using such guns a few times per day, and I've only been using the product for six months or so.		We continue to use it for basic boxing where it's less impractical and doesn't waste as much tape, but we won't make the mistake of buying this model in the future and will likely steer clear of the Scotch brand because of it.
1,4 Markers were DOA !!! Did not write and were dried up already . Awful... Will never buy ultra fine point sharpies again...
1,poor color
1,My HP printer rejected this product.  Damn!  wastes my time and might have damaged my printer. This is not the first time this has happened. Should be genuine HP ink and every now and then I get this garbage.  I now have to return it (more time wasted) Be careful.	AMAZON:  Can you do your best to ensure we are getting GENUINE  HP ink?  thank you
1,The quality of the paper is so thin!  You could literally see through!  Would not recommended!
1,Quality very bad. It arrived damaged. I had to order another one. Unfortunately, could not use that one either because it was damaged as well.
1,display missing segments out of the box	lots of hysteresis, resulting in huge variations between measurements	flimsy design of battery compartment		what a waste of resources, to use raw materials to make such crap, ship it around the world, and then twice through the contry - for nothing	I wish someone would start offering a really good scale, at a fair - not cheap - price
1,Very pretty! A terrific addition to my coloring books. A beautifully carved book holder. However, unbelievable flimsy. I got it in December and the hinge broke off in April.
1,This pencil sharpener only worked for a short time
1,Did not work. printer did not detect it.
1,Just so so. One out of three worked okay. The other two wouldn't. The covers slid off without any friction whatsoever.
1,Purchased product from amazon.com. After it arrived the product was installed . There was an issue with the quality of reproduction . Contacted the manufacturer Epson to troubleshoot  the issue . Quality of product is suspect.
1,Our corporate office purchased several of these for our office. They are horrible.		This thing chugs ink like a thirsty water buffalo. We've tried to adjust settings, but the draft setting is too light, and it keeps adjusting off the text only setting. You can't really set it up on the printer itself (unless copying, which you have to choose the setting each time...). We're going through a cartridge per week... Switching immediately to a Canon with toner.		Also, printer randomly stops communicating with the printers on the network. You have to manually power down and restart the printer then it works.		The software installation is hell. Plug and play? More like install from cd for twenty minutes. And this is on a brand new Windows 10 desktop.		The software is glitchy. Scan to pc isn't very easy to set up...		Customer service non existent.		Construction very poor quality. Cheap, thin plastic.		Pretty much the only good thing it does is tell you when it needs ink by constantly popping up a window on your pc screen...  oh and the fax works okay.		My advice: get a Brother or Canon. Epson is junk.
1,Too small for the price
1,i orderd medicine box, clear
1,This stamp kit comes with basically no directions. There are some lame pictures and instructions on the back of the package and that's all you get.		Next, do you like black ink on your fingertips because trying to put one of these together is virtually impossible without getting ink on your fingers.		After you unwrap the ink pad you'll have ink on your fingers, it's impossible to open it without getting ink on you unless you wear latex gloves.		Text anywhere near the edges does not work very well or print evenly. Best was two lines located dead center, don't make them long either, anything over 15 characters is getting in to the uneven printing and inking realm.		On the good side the ink does print on to compact discs designed for on-disk printing (the all white disks that you can run through a printer). I successfully used this ink stamp to brand some CD's we were giving away. The crude printing from this stamp kit made the printing on the CD look kind of retro and stylized, just not in a great way.		I would not buy this again. So far I think the only good option is to go have a quality self inking stamp produced at the local store, at least those work consistently and don't get ink all over your fingers. Go ahead, call me a spaz or incompetent, it's ok. If you like this product then I totally get where you're coming from but it's not for me.		Good luck to all!
1,Terrible so dark you can not read the tabs you insert	Money should be refunded.......unusable
1,I have used 1/4 of the bottle on my printer and it has no result. Follow direction to the smallest grain over a two week span and it did nothing to unclog my blue nozzle head.
1,I've used the Royal Checkbook Calculator for over 20 years.  This CBC Royal 2000 (which is the same thing I always get) is the cheapest one I've ever receive.  The one that I have now is a really nice soft leather and the new one I bought from you not only looks like cheap leather, (more like plastic) it feels like it.  I have never in my life seen one of these Royal 2000 checkbook covers look this cheesy and cheap.  I didn't even had to touch it when it arrived in the mail as all you had to do was look at it and see that it was some kind of a cheap plastic - fake leather.  Thanks for nothing.
1,Awful. Hated it. So difficult to use. After less than 6 months it broke, & their "customer service" line said we had to pay $100 just to talk to technical service to discuss if it was under warranty and fixable. We paid less money, bought an iPad, & used an $8 time clock app & are beyond thrilled with it. Highly recommend you go that route & DO NOT buy this time clock.
1,leaked ink everywhere
1,I like the pen's material, clip and finish but the nib is garbage. Single worst nib I've ever had on a pen, period.		Scratchy, dry, inconsistent flow, skipping and very very stiff		Maybe the other nibs are better but the broad is complete garbage.
1,not worth $10!
1,This is a piece of junk. do not waste your time. smears all the time and keep geeting a messaage that ink is empty.
1,This review was rejected originally, though nothing in the review violated any of the review guidelines. Makes me suspect something fishy.		This is a review of the Belkin Standard Mouse Pad.		Pros:	Inexpensive and tracks mouse easily. Surface has a slight roughness, which is good as I don't like smooth mousepads.		Cons:	Top layer started separating after just a week of usage at the office. There's a slight adhesive under the top cloth cover so removing it entirely may make the mouespad unusable.  The attached image shows the top fabric starting to detach.
1,This shredder jams repeatedly. It's the second Fellows shredder that I have had over the years and they both jammed a lot.
1,I was quite pleased when I fired this up and was able to find Linux drivers for it and get it working easily with my Linux machines.		The print quality was horrible, and I assumed there were settings to adjust, so I set about looking for a manual. Well, there isn't any. I checked Canon's web site and searched the web, only to find I was not the only person annoyed by the lack of a reasonable manual.		There are Windows and Mac OS executable files for people using those operating systems, but no manual or PDF of a manual for people to actually read. I may be "old fashioned" but I expect a paper or PDF manual with equipment I buy, and having to search out a specific kind of computer just to find out how to operate a new piece of equipment is simply bad customer service, to put i it nicely. (I'll be using stronger language on my blog.)		I'm sorry, but that is just not right. What if I only wanted to use this as a stand alone copier or fax? Granted, Linux is a difficult OS to get printers working under, but why would anyone create such good Linux drivers, and then not have a manual for those people. That is just so silly (again fighting the temptation to use stronger language).		I know that many people think paper is outdated, but this is a printer, for goodness sake. No paper manual because you want to save trees? IT"S A PRINTER. The whole point is to use paper! Well, okay, so they want to save money and not do a printed manual. What is wrong with a PDF file for a manual? Canon has them for all of the other gear I get from them, so why the illogical change of course on this printer? Bad move, to say the least.		Without better info for managing settings, the output is really terrible and the printer unusable, except as a door stop or paper weight.		Oh, and the color cartridge is an all-in-one, so you will waste a lot of good ink and spend a lot of money needlessly, as opposed to separate color cartridges.		So, be forewarned, as long as you are a Windows or Mac user, you get some kind of help as long as you want to install yet one more program for every item you connect. Everybody else is just out of luck. Canon doesn't care about you and doesn't want your business.		I may break down and connect it to my one Windows machine some day when I feel like wasting more of my valuable time, and see if I can find out the information I need. This is the second time in recent history I have been burned on a Canon printer, and I seriously doubt there will be a third. (I will also tell a lot of people about this mess.)		I don't understand some vendors - I had a really great Canon S630 that printed like a champ for a decade. I only gave it up when it finally died. I was hoping Canon would continue to make good printers. If I'd known how bad printers were going to get, I would have gotten several S630s when I had the chance.		Hiding my manual in an executable file? That is so 80s. Come on Canon, you can do better than this - at least you used to be able to.
1,This is a very good printer, prints really nice photos and crisp text!!!!		The only problem with this printer id the printhead!! The printer is defective from manufacturing and CANON knows this. LawSuit filed a few years ago.  By the way, a replacement printhead costs more than the printer!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This computer drains ink like its water.  I have to replace the cartridges at least every other week for work. The knock off cartridges don't work well. Also,  little thing I didn't know, the replacement packages do not come with the little black ink cartridge so you have a total of 5 cartridges in the printer but can only replace 4.  I have found that you can get the cartridges refilled for $7.50 a piece at Costco and at least they refill the little black one.  Terrible design, huge space and ink hog.  Terrible printer. The connections are also terrible as it constantly needs to be reset.  The 'quiet' setting is a marketing joke.  Easily the worst printer I have ever purchased.
1,Don't last way too expensive
1,It's a mediocre printer.  However the colors are bland and not accurate.  Don't know if it's a bad machine.  I just know it's not a very good machine.  Now, three months later, my machine keeps grabbing the wrong paper if there's more than one type in the two trays.  So I have to remove the wrong paper and ensure I only have the size I plan to print on.  Finally the paper trays do not hold the paper - so it the side holders get loose and the paper prints off center.  Basically this machine is a lot more trouble than it's worth.
1,The printer DOES NOT connect to Wifi, despite my following the directions. It's a cheap printer that gets the job done in terms of printing, but if you have a little extra, buy something nicer.
1,Of the 5-tries 3-did not count correctly.  I deal with large quantities of $1bills and need a counter that is not as fussy as this one.  There is a video of the unit showing it counting perfectly.  Notice that the bills are brand new and very flat with clean edges.
1,Would not print the first page form these cartridges.  Amazon refunded my purchase.
1,Had to return for refund.
1,tried 4 colors black blue orange and red to use on plastic nothing covered what i wanted to refresh the items. supposedly permanent, not true could see thru the items that i used pens on.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE AT ALL!  They stick on for about a week and then fall down and break your phone.  Who's going to replace my telephone?  NOT THESE PEOPLE!! CERTAINLY DO NOT BUY THESE UNLESS YOU LEAVE THEM EMPTY.  I DID NOT EVEN PUT MY PHONE IN IT ALL THE TIME.  IT IS NOT STEAMY OR HUMID HERE.  THEY ARE TOTAL CRAP.  Certainly do not buy them for a gift - as they will break their phone too, as has also happened here.  TOTAL GARBAGE. I AM NOT KIDDING YOU.  DO NOT BUY THEM.  THEY BREAK PHONES.
1,Never worked properly and was thrown in the trash.
1,As with all printers, the main catch is with the supplies.	This printer requires both Toners and Drums to be replaced.	Which basically make up for a printer that only requires more expensive toners regularly.	So same stuff.
1,this only works on straight up paper, that is placed on a table. the photo in the advertisement is a lie. WILL NOT mark out names/addresses on boxes, and does not work on tape or any gloss. The ink will just wipe right off
1,It is a pain to reload post its.
1,Now every time I print in color, the whole page is covered in pink dots.
1,I have used these pencils for years and I love them.  The grips are VERY comfortable.  The last pencil I had lasted for four years before it disappeared off my desk at work.  The two stars is not for the pencil but for the fact that what was sent does not match the advertised picture.  I had anticipated receiving two gray pencils; instead I get one gray and one blue/purple.  I know, I know...First World problems.  But am still hoping Amazon takes notice of this and makes whatever adjustment they need to.
1,I bought the drum and two toners a while back as a reserve.  The toners worked fine, but the drum is a loss.  It prints lines across the page.  Maybe it is the age of the drum, though I haven't had this problem before.  So 4 stars for the toner and 0 for the drum
1,Like the other reviewer noted, the system kept generating a rather loud buzzing noise. I tried relocating it to different outlets, to no avail. It's going back to the seller.
1,Labels don't stick. And after only a few uses, the numbers to change the prices ARE stuck, they won't change.
1,POOR material.  Does not last!  NOT recommended.
1,Cheap Cheap describes the construction of these boxes perfectly.  They are thinner than most boxes and won't hold much weight.  It's easy to poke a hole.  They are easily the most poorly constructed boxes I've ever encountered.		Cheap Cheap does *not* relate to the price.  Take a trip to H.D. (or equivalent) and you will find boxes that are 50% thicker and stronger - for less money.		I will never buy these boxes again nor order any of their products.
1,I ordered this printer , it seems give me error message when I try to print , I will give 2 star for this .
1,I thought that I had ordered a two pack of calendars one for me and one for me mommy. Space space.....  song in my surprise when I find they are over a year old I returnedth
1,X-Acto Powerhouse Electric Pencil Sharpener		Pros:	- Good looking for a power sharpener	- Not overly big	- Tough, with a lot of use by kids still going strong after over a year		Cons:	- Super loud compared to several other quieter pencil sharpeners	- Receptacle fairly small.  Unless you like wood shavings spills, when it gets full, bring sharpener to basket to clean out.	- No strong hint that it is done sharpening like I've felt in some other sharpeners.		Consider looking at this one:	-&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bostitch-QuietSharp-6-Classroom-Electric-Pencil-Sharpener-6-Holes-Blue-EPS10HC/dp/B0014CI10E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bostitch QuietSharp  6 Classroom Electric Pencil Sharpener, 6-Holes, Blue (EPS10HC)</a>
1,Misleading by far. I see three colors in the listing right here. I ordered 2 packs and each had only green pads. No way you can call that "Multi Color Jr ..."	Whether or nor I can or want to return these, this is incredibly annoying. I tried to read very carefully to be sure the pack would be mixed colors. It doesn't appear the perforation is fine enough for effective (even) tear off . That is a pet peeve when using any padded paper.
1,My printer was working GREAT and I decided to save some money and get this....It leaves marks all down the edge of the paper. Very disappointed!!
1,It does what it's supposed to do.  But you have to take into consideration the time to manually slot one piece of paper over and over again.		This unit wore out on us very quickly.  We were folding two and three pieces at a time.  Picked up a Martin Yale unit with auto feed for approx $300 and it works much better and saves much more time.  This type of manual feed unit shows it's limitations pretty quickly.  I'd save your money and get an entry level auto feed unit.  Will be worth it in the long run.
1,I upgraded to this model over the MFC230 I had, hoping it would not jam paper when I tried using the heavier weight paper to do brochures up.  This one was worse then the MFC230.  I was CONSTANTLY unjamming paper! I am now going to have to try to go with a different brand.  [...]
1,Waaaay Smaller than I expected.  I needed to tape up some boxes to ship overseas.  I endued up using up a roll of tape, I was expecting more tape and it is smaller.
1,I didn't want to write a bad review, because I have used these and they have been good so I stocked up on some in February and they just within the last couple of months have tried to use them and both boxes I purchased did not work.  I have tried emailing the company with no response.  I have since purchased some different cartridges and they print just fine.  So I will not ever purchase these again since the company won't respond back to my emails.
1,This is an awful glue stick.  It dries way, way too fast, so by the time you've put glue on the whole item, the first part of the item is already dry and won't stick.  Other glue sticks at least give you 30 seconds or so, this one doesn't.
1,As someone who frequently travels with a laptop, the Targus Slim Lap Desk intrigued me.  I have a 15.4" business laptop, just the size the packaging claims is right for this Lap Desk.  It zips closed to a reasonably slim profile and is indeed something you could slip into a laptop bag, though it is about 3/4" thick at the zipper and this may give you grief if clearance is tight.		When you unzip it the spring-loaded flap pops open. Underneath the fabric are plastic panels - a large one for the desk surface and a smaller one for the riser.  The fabric is permanently attached and a span of fabric on the bottom keeps the riser panel from going back too far.		The first issue I had was that I could not find a stable position for my laptop on the desk.  If I placed it wholly on the desk, it wobbled significantly and did not sit flat.  I eventually found a position where the front edge of the laptop rested on the table and the back edge was on the rubber pads, but it kept slipping off from here.  Typing was complicated by the laptop bouncing with each keypress - the fabric allows the riser to angle back a bit when pressed.		Ok, this is billed as a "lap desk".  How does it do for that?  Not well.  I am very long-legged, and the back riser just barely comes in past my knees. It does work for this purpose and I suppose it's better than nothing at keeping the heat off your lap, but it felt precarious to me. If you are shorter, you may find it falling off your lap.  And it's still bouncy.		However, I have to call "foul" on the claim of ventilation.  There is none.  While the fabric covering looks very "hole-ly", it is sitting on a solid plastic panel with only a few tiny holes in it.  Any ventilation you get is due to the laptop (hopefully) sitting on the rubber pads.  If it instead is sitting flat on the desk, then the fabric probably does more harm than good.		If you routinely travel with a laptop and use it on your lap, rather than a table or desk, then you may find the Targus Slim Lap Desk useful. But if your lap use is mainly at home, I'd suggest something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Belkin-Cushdesk/dp/B002882NB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Belkin Cushdesk</a>&nbsp;instead.
1,This item was shipped quickly and came in one piece HOWEVER. It looks used. I will keep it, as I need it	right away and don't have time to reorder. When you pay for something new, it should be in new condition.	Just saying!
1,These seals are indeed wafer thin as advertised and easily tear at the perforation if you actually fold them over at the end of the mail piece at the perforation.		Because the material is so thin, I was able to fold them over just a 1/16th of an inch to the left or right of the perforation and they remain intact.		If you fold them on the perforation they'll be open way before they reach their destination.
1,When I put this cartridge in my printer, the printer said it was disabled.  I have never had this happen before, and I have had this printer 2 or 3 years and use a lot of ink!  I am not happy!
1,Just now getting around to reviewing this product.  I wanted to wait for a bit before writing to see what the long term wear would be like- turns out, this broke within a month of my purchase.  I used it to hold photography backdrop paper, and after a couple weeks I noticed it was leaning a lot.  I tried propping it up but it kept leaning (despite tightening the bolts).  Within the month it fell over completely and was bent.  I contacted the company and they were great and sent me a replacement pole.  But sadly the new one bent too within a couple of weeks!  So frustrating.  I wish I could get my money back or get a new one altogether.  So sad :(
1,The phones worked poorly and I hated the ear bud.  I returned this.
1,I use dry erase markers a everday for work.  Very disappointed with these.  First one I used after a couple hours seemed faded....so grabbed another one, same thing.  Really so I figure what, I will go through all these in a week??  I have ones from The Board Dudes and the one marker has lasted over a month!!
1,Badly manufactured.  Leaks!  Buy a Pilot or Laney.  For. a few dollars more you'll thank yourself.
1,This thing prints labels ok but it eats batteries. I have only gotten about four labels and I've had to replace batteries twice.  I just don't understand.  At first I thought I left it on, then I was sure to turn it off and it did the same thing. I am not happy.
1,Ordered 6 boxes. Half the markers received are dried out, a few boxes had markers with caps that wouldn't fit on the markers and thus the drying out. Also one box came with 11 markers instead of 12 as stated.
1,Even though this is a two-hole sharpener- with one larger, it will not fit at least some 'jumbo' pencils such as the Lyra Skintone brand.  This is especially odd since another one almost identical to this sharpener- by the same company, only without the flip up lip will fit the Lyra Skintone pencil and other 10mm pencils.  But this one will not.  So if you need to sharpen pencils that are somewhat fatter than standard...the 'jumbo' or 10mm pencils won't fit either hole in this sharpener even though the same company makes another that will.
1,Nice to find graph paper without reinforced holes.	Unfortunately, the lines are too dark and distracting.	Unusable product.
1,Absolutely no longevity and like HPs it provides ink for a small number of printouts or quickly dries up.  Consider a toner so this doesn't need to be used.
1,Not as expected... maybe good for lightweight use,but not suggested for an office
1,There's a big...at least an inch long...wrapped all the way around....bar code label on every pencil in the box!!!  And it's not easily removable and leaves sticky residue behind.		What a STUPID thing to do.		I guess I'm just labeled out in this world we live in now.....labels EVERYWHERE...non removable....with stupid warnings and ads and....OK I'll stop.		But just wanted to let others know....these beautiful pencils are RUINED by the label.....on every single pencil in the box.....I know I'm starting to repeat myself......stick a fork in me...I'm done  :o)
1,I just threw mine in the trash after having it about two and a half years.  The good: it worked for two years without major problems with very light use (once a week).  The bad: It was slow.  The worst part about the being slow was that it would almost always have to go through a cleaning cycle while I was trying to use it. In addition what I did not know until later about the cleaning cycle was that it uses a lot of ink each cycle.  Then about six months ago I tried to print a photo and it didn't look right and had lines through it.  I called customer support and they said one of the ink cartridges was not working.  So, I changed cartridges with no improvement.  Then they said to do several cleaning cycles; that did not help either.  Then they said they would give me a good price on a new Canon printer.  I decided to do without color printing and just use the black for documents.  Then a few days ago it stopped and gave a message that the machine needed repair.  Well, I had already found out through customer service that there was no repairing these things.  So, in the trash it went. I am buying a Brother laser printer; I'm done with the ink jets.  I have to admit that Canon's customer service was very accessible and responded quickly.  There is just not much you can do to these things if they don't work.  The laser printers are supposed to be more reliable, especially if you use them infrequently, which the ink jets don't like.
1,They are not 2x2 as stated in description. They are the smaller ones. Disappointed I can't use them as they are to small. I can't return due to I opened to see size.
1,I purchased the black cartridge bundled with my new HP printer I ordered on July 18.  I used this printer only 10 days before the ink ran out.  SCAM.
1,If Rube Goldberg designed a printer, this piece would probably be it.  Clanky, noisy, sounds like a thrashing machine, especially at startup and shutdown.  Mine came free as part of a promotion. To date, I still haven't received rebates from HP or MacMall.  The printer goes through ink at an unbelievable pace. The 60XL  (higher capacity cartridges) ink cartridges don't even come close to delivering the claimed typical number of pages.		As for print quality, it is adequate for text and small photos. Anyone that believes it can deliver professional looking 8x10 prints is simply blind. The banding and graininess are unacceptable with large prints.  Had I purchased this printer instead of receiving it as a promotional item, I would have returned it and asked for a purchase refund.		The small Canon and Epson all in one printers are a far better choice. Canon customer support is far better than HP and with Canon at least you're speaking with someone in a call center in Virginia instead of half way around the world.
1,I've been using it for almost 3 years now.  The print quality, especially the colors 'snapping' off the page compared to my ink jet, is very nice. My dissatisfactions:		1) slow print speed, especially for b&w.		2) the printer suddenly finding a need to calibrate or clean itself, even when it hasn't been in use for awhile, which makes some quiet level of noise		3) the munchkin sized print tray, which runs out of paper very quickly even for my 1-person office. It also doesn't accept being filled to the top, and if you try to do so it'll jam.  So, it has to be filled about 95% to the top to work right.		4) the cost of toner, especially for color which seems exorbitant for the number of pages each can do. The estimate of how much toner is left is close to a joke, especially for the color.  It claims to be empty after maybe 2000 pages.  I get roughly 7000 pages out of the toner cartridges, with very light usage such as doing color line graphs. The B&W estimate is fairly accurate, with a few hundred extra pages possible beyond what it's claiming.  Bottom line: it helps HP's bottom line if you panic too soon and replace cartridges that still have plenty of toner.  Again, this leaves me underwhelmed with their decision making process.		5) I can't get it to do envelopes and labels. Maybe I'm stupid, but it always seems to jam or not pick them up.		6) I couldn't get it to do e-printing, such as off my iPhone. Again, maybe I'm just stupid, and not enough of a techno geek.  But I gave up trying to configure it, and just stuck with USB corded transmission which works fine.		7) HP being really stupid in how much memory they equipped it with.  My 2 year old Canon multi-function ink jet has a far faster printing speed for PDF files than this HP machine, apparently because of the extra memory. The Canon has virtually no wait time before it starts printing. The HP takes minutes, literally, before it can print a single page, and each PDF page thereafter is equally slow, in minutes, to print. I assume the HP has a faster processor, but can't make good use of it without enough memory.  There's a slot for adding an extra 256 mb of memory - and I bought some off this Amazon site. It fits the slot, but it's not compatible with it.  And HP phone support has been worthless - they claim there is no extra memory available for this machine, even though the slot for it exists, and it's in the manual as to how to upgrade. Why they didn't include sufficient memory from the outset, given the current cost of chips being so low, seems really stupid to me.		8) After about 3 years and 45,000 pages of printing it died very suddenly, making a racket, and jamming with each and every page printed.		Overall, this will be my last HP printer I buy.  I kept my last laser jet, the HP 1200, for 12 years, 100K+ pages, for a reason - fast, cheap, reliable.  It's printing speed for PDF files was about as pathetic as this one, which is a sad testimony to HP decision making, given how much processing speed has increased in the interim.		What this printer does, it does well in terms of print quality, and being quieter than the old HP 1200 which always clunked when it turned itself off to save energy.  I do like the quieter nature of this machine.  But, too many compromises got made with the 1525.
1,What a cool idea! This is perfect for students of any age. This is nothing more than a Post-it and Flag holder, within a foldable cover, which adheres to the inside of a binder...perhaps even inside of a mobile device case.		The set comes with a hundred flags, and twenty five Post-it tabs, and this convenient kit is as east to refill as it is to use.		Consider adhering the kit to the inside-left side of a binder so that it will not be an interference while writing.		The adhesive on the back of the flap will dry, and the kit will fall right out of a notebook, so I would suggest keeping it in a pencil pouch or something.
1,SUCH a frustrating piece of garbage!	Starting with the scanner itself, when it bothers to work at all, it scans very low quality blurry and pixelated images, even when scanning text documents. The rollers that feed the paper through the scanner will mangle, crush, and rip my documents around 25% of the time. Trying to scan multiple documents at the same time is also a problem as it will feed through 2 pages and make them stuck together.		The software is even worse. Doing simple things like scanning a document will make the program crash. When you finally manage to scan your document, when you edit the document metadata (name, amount, date, etc.), it will revert your changes for no reason. You make your edits, come back to it later and your edits are gone.		If you want to be able to access your documents from another computer, there's a neat cloud service, but you have to pay a monthly fee for it. I signed up for it and tried to access my documents from my smart phone and found out that I couldn't, because you have to pay a higher monthly fee to access your documents from a phone!		The tech support is beyond terrible. The email support is practically non-existant. Whatever you email them, they will send you back an automated form letter that has nothing to do with what problem you're having. For example I complained about the software crashing and losing metadata and they recommended I clean the scanner! The phone support is even worse, if you can even get through, and the phone support is not free!
1,Not as dark as the led that comes with the paper mate pencil....
1,DO NOT ... DO NOT ... DO NOT buy this printer, or any printer by Epson. Many have designed obsolescence built into the software, and after modest use the printer will shut down saying that the ink pads are full, and you need to return the printer to Epson for maintenance (which costs about as much as a new printer). I will never ever even consider another Epson product the rest of my life, under any circumstances, and if you're smart, you won't either.
1,These mouse rugs are really cute.  However, they don't seem to work very well with the mouse.  I had to actually change my settings on my PC mouse to the fastest speed and tracking they could go and the mouse is still pretty dog slow now.  As for my Mac mouse... I gave up and went back to my old mouse pad because it wouldn't work at all with my wireless mighty mouse.  So, my daughter is now using this mouse pad as a rug for her Barbie house.  So... although these are really nice looking, they really don't work well.
1,I guess I didn't read the description correctly, or what, but I had wanted to use it for my gel pens and you couldn't fill all the spots - too cramped, so I couldn't fit all my pens.  I sent it back.
1,Doesnt work very well.
1,I took delivery of this "high end" sharpener with great expections.  Unfortunately my hopes were thoroughly dashed the instant I first tried it out.  All I can say in its favor is that it's powerful.  Despite my every attempt at control, each pencil quickly ended up over-sharpened with an off-center loppy irregular cut to a uselessly sharp pinpoint.  If the user doesn't keep a tight on the pencil the sharpener spins it out of your hand.  Can't any manufacturer make a product that comes to doing the job one used to get from an old hand-cranked Boston screwed to the wall?  How can other reviewers love this pig?	~Gary
1,The tape is probably OK but neither of the two LM160 label makers I bought will not work.
1,I used this for packing when I moved. The tape did not stick well to the boxes. Was a bit disappointed because I always used their brand for sending out small packages & it worked well but this packing tape was not as good.
1,Returned this printer the day after I received it. Got it all unpacked, hooked up and installed the ink. It immediately said one of the ink cartridges needed replacing...?? They were both brand new out of the package. It would only print in the black- the color it would not read at all. I cut it off and took it out several times, reinstalling. Still nothing. I was not going to run out and buy another brand new color ink cartridge when it wasn't reading this brand new, out of the pack cartridge....UGH back in the box and returned. On to the next printer.
1,The description sounded like it was quite small in size - it is not, the cover is thick and bulky and there is too much extra room around the edges.  It's going back.
1,They produce deep grey waved edge writing line.
1,Not great
1,Very disappointed. I loved Flair pens when they first came out. These were probably re-packaged from the 70s because two were dried out. I didn't realize until it was too late to return them.
1,These don't work as good as the clear one I just used up.  The clear one glued paper together great.  These purple ones do not glue paper to paper very well.  The piece glued falls off easily.
1,Half of pencils were broke... box was ripped.
1,Didn't work.  Returned. Received refund.
1,Works for a while.  The tape feed mechanism is very chincy and worked well with light use for about a month, then worked poorly for about 2 months, then stopped working altogether.  It also eats batteries and will only work with the freshest batteries installed.  I suggest you spend a little more money and buy a better labelier.
1,WIsh I could review this without even giving a star to this horrible product. It is crazy as hell, prints by itself lots of things every time it wants to notify useless stuff. The toner runs out of ink faster than what it took this printer to arrive. Wish I could return it right away but, I got another toner and need to use it before I request a full refund for shipping this back. I truly made high expectations because of the reviews but I don't know what those people got that they wrote lies about this.		1st it doesn't make copies, doesn't scan, doesn't fax, doesn't do anything but printing what it wants and whenever it wants it LOL if you are looking for a machine to be the boss here you have one, a sleepy printer that loves to sleep forever! Hopefully I might be still able to return it after I use my toner that I bought separate and was half the price of the printer.
1,My father in law bought this last Thursday from a brick and mortar store. I tried to set it up on Sat. The problems started after I installed the ink cartridges and pressed OK. The message on the LCD said it should take about 5 minutes to initialize. 45 minutes later, it was still on the initializing screen.		I called customer support. For an hour, it was a contiuous cycle of turn off power, unplug the printer, wait 5 seconds, then plug it back in and try again. For a while, the print cartridge carrier wouldn't move out far enough to get access to the print cartridges. Eventually, after an hour, I was able to ge the printer to copy something. The Customer Support guy even said this printer should be replaced. We took it back, and eventually got a Canon.		Other nits. When you open the tray to access the printer area, the top cover overbalances and swings back quickly. Whenever you turn the printer off, and back on, you still need to reset the time and date. Couldn't they spring for a small lithium battery to keep the date and time going?		If I could, I'd give this printer a negative rating!
1,Not worth the money !
1,Sent this and the printer back as the cost is crazy.
1,Good board. But. Erases and holds magnets well. Mine came damaged. The Marker holder was bent badly when I received it. I would like a replacement but I think it will be too much trouble to send it back since it came by freight. I wish the supplier could send me a new marker holder because I am very dissapointed having a brand new board that is already bent. But I'm not holding my breath.
1,I purchased the Lexmark Platinum Pro905 because of the advertised warranty and ink cost / savings. Very disappointed with both the warranty and ink usage.	I received the printer from Amazon around the middle of August 2010. I connected it to my home network without a problem and the interface to operate it was easy to understand. I was very pleased with the printer at this time.		Around October 29,2010 I contacted Lexmark help line because I was out of Cyan ink and two of the other cartridge appeared low to me.		I thought we only printed about 30 or 40 pages since purchase, but after about 2 hours on the help line (he networked into my pc to check the printer out) I was told that we printed 119 pages per the self test page. Which still did not explain all the ink use. Also while looking at the self test page I noticed the print head information indicated ink usage as 1% black used, 1% yellow used, 2% Cyan used, and 1% Magenta used. It also showed that 74 pages were printed. I brought this to the attention of the support staff person and he could not explain the difference.		Support decided to send me a cyan cartridge, have me install it and call back to see it they could repair the issue then. For some reason he could not get the printer to do what he was trying to do. He said that if that solved the issue then he would send me the other three cartridges. If it did not solve the problem he was going to send me another print head. I had no problem at this point. At least they appeared to be standing behind their product. He was going to rush the ink cartridge (3 to 5 days)		Two week later I for called again for the cartridge that had not been delivered yet. I received it 3 days later.		After receiving I installed and called the help line for them to check the printer again. Completely different story now. They would send me the other three cartridges one time and nothing is wrong with the printer. I explained that I purchased the Lexmark because of the warranty and the low cost of ink that they advertised and I was not happy with either right now. I was informed that I had the printer over 30 days now and I was stuck with the printer. I told them that I replace a HP Photosmart for their printer due to ink cost and the Lexmark did not print as sharp as the HP and it was costing me more for the Lexmark ink at this rate than HP. I was told she was very sorry but she could not do anything for me.		I told her that I felt the ink advertisement and warranty they advertised was false and I would let anyone I met know not to purchase a Lexmark product.		If you managed to get a Lexmark that works as advertised, good for you. If you do not have a lexmark, do not purchase one.		I called Amazon help line and as usual they surpassed any expectation I had after explaining my problem.		You can not go wrong purchasing anything from Amazon.		Do not purchase a Lexmark printer ever.		By the way. I connected my HP Photosmart back up and it is working like a charm. I just hate the price of ink.
1,Couldn't use the device. Partially my fault but there are other factors involved. I ordered two of these for the 4 monitor setup I was working on to surround my 30" center screen.		This is where things got stupid. I was looking at a ton of different offerings on Amazon, Tigerdirect, Newegg.....all over the place. When I hit this item, I compared price, visuals, read some reviews. Never noticed that even though I selected the 24 inch keyword that this still came up as an option. I just did a search at the time of writing this and it does exactly the same thing. Monitor Arms in home office => third page I believe. Key word 24 inch. My failure for not noticing that in the description that it says up to 22".		Now, I failed there but someone else is full of crap too. Not sure if the seller inputs the keywords for his products or whether Amazon does this.		Now i go to send them back, they reply with yes, just send them back and you can have your money. The shipping address to get them back now conveniently goes to someones home. It is a home address, not a business. That combined with the weight makes it not even worth trying to send them back. When the UPS guy told me how much, I nearly had a grabber. That was ground, no frills.		I literally left the box unopened and set it to the side and bought the best stand for the money, a real good buy without this sneaky crap on the side.	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DGU92DM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
1,My Epson printer does not recognize the cartridges for some reason and refuses to print. I have ordered ink from Amazon.com before without issue. I don't know what the deal is.
1,I bought these to use in adult coloring books.  I'm always seeing metallic gel pens and hoped this would achieve a similar result without taking quite so long to color.  Unfortunately, these don't work well with coloring books.  The "ink" in these comes out very much like an opaque paint.  It colors right over top of any black lines, giving pictures a very messy look.  The colors themselves are pretty (though the metallic sheen isn't quite as nice once they dry) and would be more suitable for other types of projects.  They also line pretty thickly, so they aren't even useful for adding interesting detail to coloring pages.
1,Difficult to assemble. Very confusing instructions.
1,It doesn't state in the description of these file folders that they are recycled.  The file folder is cheap and not very strong.  I thought I was ordering a good and well known product made by Pendaflex.  I cannot recommend these file folders due to the flimsy, light-weight product.  Very disappointed in this product.
1,The used film from this fax has a readable record of EVERYTHING you received.  So confidential information faxed to you will be readable on the used ink film rolls you throw away.  Shred the film before throwing it away or don't buy the fax.  I am trying to get my money back.
1,This phone has some good design features. It sits firmly on the charging base , has a handset locator button on the base, has caller ID , and all of the usual features that are helpful.  The sound quality through the earpiece is only fair. The biggest problem is the slow acting keypad. There is a noticable delay between pushing a button, and the phone responding.  It becomes nearly impossible to quickly enter a phone number, because the phone lags behind half a step.  I'm a senior citizen, but I can easily dial numbers faster than this phone can accept them.  I'm going to replace this phone with another brand . One more thing ;  While checking around my house with an RF frequency detector,  I found that the base part of this phone emits very high levels of RF energy , even when the handset part is turned off and in another room. No other phone in my house emits such high level RF signals when not in use. Very strange.
1,The worst electric pencil sharpener I've ever used? I think so! To sum up: not much power, chews up pencils, and the design of it is poorly thought out. When you unscrew the top to dump out the pencil shavings, turning it upside down will make the sharpener part detach. It will then fall out into the trash can, and when you try to put it back in you have 1/2" of space to squeeze your fingers in. Eventually, the sharpener piece got dumped out with the shavings and this is now a motorized noisemaker.
1,I bought these sheets to use as bumper sticker material.  But	the material is SO THIN and so barely magnetic that they just	fall off after a day or two.		They are passably good for a fridge door magnet but only for	display - nowhere near enough power to hold anything to the metal.
1,Good size for my cards, but seal does not work well.  Have to use tape.
1,I am not a computer expert, and that is what was needed to connect this scale to my computer.
1,Scanner has a mind of its own and works sometimes only!
1,When I received it 3 of the 4 inking edges were broken. Returning this.
1,What a piece of junk!! This trash couldn't even stand the rigors of being put together without completely falling apart. The mfgr has got a lot of nerve passing this off as anything put complete junk!! Total waste of money.
1,Lexmark stopped making ink jet printers a few years ago.  Their printers use separate ink cartridges for each color including black.  Once the color cartridges start getting low and you get that message on the display for each color, the printer doesn't work until you buy more color cartridges since it won't print in black even if you specify black only.  They set it up that way so you have continually buy color cartridges that don't last long.  Rather than waste any more money on cartridges for an obsolete and often malfunctioning printer, I donated the Lexmark printer to the recycle program and bought another brand that works great and does not have separate color cartridges for each color.
1,I hate the return program for this ink. The cartridges are never refilled completely and they're still expensive. Unfortunately since this is an older model of ink, the return program is the only way to get this ink. I bought a new printer (it's a Brother) and it works so much better and the ink is well worth the price, unlike this.
1,Not the quality I was expecting.  They are actually quite flimsy and wouldn't hold the books I intended to use them for in my classroom. I should have paid attention when ordering that these are listed as "economy" which pretty well sums it up.
1,As Described and would repurchase
1,These pens don't have much ink and runs out too fast.
1,I had high hopes for this pen.  Unfortunately it's not well designed.  It's off balance both for writing and even for being in a pocket.  Plus the sharp top is a real hand and fabric grabber.  Not a good product.
1,Cheap substitute for when I should've actually bought this is crap, it doesn't work
1,These don't show you which direction to feed these into the shredder. Maybe it doesn't matter, but I'm used to lubricant sheets that show you which end to feed in first.
1,These are not great. They are definitely not for doing any type of important project.
1,I used only Pentel 0.3mm leads(the only ones available I can find), because it's so thin it breaks off easily which is annoying inside the pencil as it jams the tip as the lead gets stuck. I wish Pentel used a thin wire probe that appears in some other pencils on the bottom of the eraser. I couldn't figure out for a long time what that wire was except to for except jab into my finger when I press the eraser to extend the lead(after losing the cap, which is easy to do), now I know. But those were in bigger leads like .5 and .7 which do not jam as often due to their thickness. I think this is a problem with the lead, especially softer ones like HB and B's
1,I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing these.  They are horrible!  This skip terribly and they are just an erasable ball point pen marketed as a liquid graphite pencil.  Don't buy these.  I love all other Sharpie products, and I'm shocked that Sharpie let these go to market.
1,I purchased this toner in September 2016 and here it is January 2017 and have to purchase a new one and not even 100 pages of plain text have been printed!  Purchases made from my local office supply store cost a few dollars more, but definitely worth it because they generally last well over a year.  Will Not Purchase from this vendor again.
1,None of these show up well on light paper or folders.  Suggest their use is for other than office.
1,Ink smudges. This is the 1st time that I used generic ink and I regret it. I used this item. All the papers were coming out very bad. I had to leave work in the middle of the day to buy ink for my printer. Very frustrating.
1,This product was not worth purchasing.  The pictures to not come out very clear because it is a low gloss grade paper, if you want good pictures spend a little more, it's well worth it in one run.  Otherwise this is pretty much just good for school presentations where photo quality is not that big of a concern.
1,Bought this mat August 2016.  Over the past couple of months or so, it has developed 3 cracks, the largest being about 5 inches across.  I purchased this one because, if I'm not mistaken, it was guaranteed for life.  However, someone's review said the vendor charges $30 to replace.  Bad deal.  Caveat emptor...
1,They are way to thin for the price that you pay.
1,No way it lasts for 200 print copies.... I used it and printed about 50 and ink was gone........Recommend getting long life cartridge..
1,The product reads and even illustrates: "BLUE Airmail Paper." The ONLY blue was the cardstock cover!! The rest of the airmail paper, though lovely onion skin quality, WAS NOT BLUE!! The very reason that I ordered it was so that someone could receive a lovely shade of steel blue from our travels abroad this coming summer. Instead, I get the typical white paper and no blue for miles! I kept it because I like the quality of the paper - HOWEVER, I am HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED over the false advertising!! x(
1,Weird and small.
1,Helps  cushion your finger when writing but then literally it broke after just using it a couple of days.
1,OK, it's 4 stars for the physical machine, well-made by Brother as always, and 1 star for the included software (I have Windows 7 64 bit) and absurdly bad customer service.  The software refused to install, repeatedly giving a <WINSYSDIR> "access denied" message.  Nothing - and I mean NOTHING - I did could make it work.  Then I called Brother tech support and the guy hung up on me the second I read the error message to him.  What?  Is it unfixable?  Or was it close to end of shift and he couldn't be bothered?  Schmuck.  Without the software, I can print via USB but the wireless feature is unusable (at least without running it through a wireless router).  And one should be aware that you have to set the machine up for USB or wireless - you can't have both at the same time (hence 4 stars instead of 5 for the machine).  Bottom line, I have to admit that I still like the printer, but Brother has got to fix the software.  FYI - the printer cartridges are relatively easy to refill from one of the really cheap bottles of toner available here on Amazon and work flawlessly.  Just don't spill any or it becomes a permanent part of whatever it hits.
1,The wrap is fine but the bar ends on ours were warped and one broke easily, making it difficult to wrap our packages. As a result we wound up using much more wrap than expected. You might want to spring for the fancy rolling dispenser one.
1,These pens were cheap and appropriately priced.  They collect ink on the tip, and deposit it randomly as you write.  Any cheap BIC is better.
1,The pages on this brand curl up at the bottom. Buy a more expensive brand with thicker paper.
1,not strong enough needed the permanent tape instead
1,It is not thick enough to stop divots. meaning your chair causes deep impressions and your chair will not roll smoothly.
1,This hole puncher is horrible.  It only fits about 1 piece of paper in at a time, and then in order to get the paper out, I have to wiggle it a whole bunch!  I would like a replacement.
1,Chair sets to high for me, unfortunately poor information provided in the description area you don't find out about the chair height until you receive the chair but by then it's to late as they will charge you a restocking fee and you yourself has to pay return shipping which is almost half the price of the chair so you're basically stuck with this thing once you ordered it.
1,i followed the directions but it just doesen't work . i think the problem is deeper inside the machine. thanks anyway
1,Ink was too light.  Not worth it.  Wouldn't order from them again.
1,Yep it's a mouse pad nice and thick. (UPDATE) I've had the pad for about a week and while it looks good . The fabric is coming off the pad. I wouldn't buy this again.
1,I Still have to use tape as their glue doesnt work and bottom edge doesnt stick well either
1,I tried using it to hold up a extension cord, but it did not work. This cord is way less then 5 lb's and this tape should have worked.
1,These come in flimsy cheap colored binders. It shows solid white with added color to them
1,somewhat flimsy
1,We have had nothing but trouble with our first one but I did some research and found out there is really nothing durable anymore.  I ordered the same one again because it was easier to install..  First it said we had the incorrect cartridges after we spent a fortune for the HP cartridges and at first it would only print occasionally.  I cleaned the cartridges and then had a carriage jam which would not resolve.  II hope we have some better luck with this other one.  The price was right and we only use it occasionally.  It may be discontinued but someone still had one in a box.
1,The signs are nice however due to the poor over packaging they turned out to be trashed as mine came with foot impressions and the signs were trashed. Very disappointed
1,Too expensive and only lasts 6 months and you can tell there is toner but it just stops printing based on whatever is programmed.  Regular toners usually works after a nice shake but this one does not work at all after shaking.  So it is ripping people off.
1,I have a photosmart premium.  I put these cartridges in (yes, took off the orange tabs) and installed all the cartridges, but the printer said cartridges were not installed, or bad.  Nothing I did could make them work.  The printer didn't listen to OK or cancel, or anything that might have let me try to print anyway.  So many people say they work.  I have no idea what is wrong.
1,Spray pump does not work well.
1,my Brother printer doesn't realize it's there.  keeps saying I need to replace the drum after I put thsi one in
1,They leak!
1,Barely two stars.  So far my biggest show stopper problem is that the printheads clog and will not come clean using the Clean function in the software. I do not use the printer daily and this may be the problem. However, my Canon Pro900 MarkII can sit for months and pass the print test first time every time. Ergo, this is a design flaw in the Epson.		Also, the scan to PC function simply will not work. I place documents in the ADF tray but the software never sees this and instead takes a scan of the empty glass bed. Therefore I have to scan to a USB key and sneakernet it to my PC.		Btw, I would never spend $1200 or even $900 on a printer that I didn't intend to use daily and heavily. I got it as a floor display unit for $125 new plus a two year warranty for about another $125 plus about $300 for the standard ink bags. Good price BUT if I have to send it in for service what happens to my ink bags. Also, try shipping one of these! They are huge and heavy, and I could not find a large enough sturdy box to ship it in even at U-Haul.
1,The card stock is thin and  not at all very durable.  I wouldn't buy them again and don't think they will last long.  Rolodex is a good brand so I thought I was getting a good product... NOT the case.
1,Absolutely worthless. Couldn't hold a banana to a tree. Why write such things as it can hold over 10 lbs or more? I rather have an ant hold it for me and it will do a better job. Unbelievable nonsense. Very very disappointed. Nothing Extreme about this tape. Only the extreme frustration it causes.
1,These are not compatible with the Kodak Hero 4.2 as stated.  I returned them.
1,It says extra large but lasts only  3 days after printing 30 small brochures with minimal graphic and color. The single cartridges lasted longer ( one week) after doing about 60 brochures double the amount that the XL cartridge did. Makes me wonder if the cartridges are full.
1,a little pricey
1,In an effort to try and organize my home office, I bought to hang files in a decorative box. It received good reviews so I decided to go for it. When I started assembling it, it was MUCH harder to assemble than I expected. First off, I didn't realize that this is only adjustable one time. I was expecting it to be able to slide back and forth to whatever length you want but instead, you have to use pliers to cut the metal piece where you want it.		Second, the metal pieces are connected together by little plastic pieces that you have to HAMMER together. Now, I don't shy away from hard-to-assemble items but for a little hanging file folder frame, I wasn't expecting that. The plastic pieces kept popping off when I would go to assemble the other side and it was very frustrating.		Once I finally got it all together per the instructions, it was TOO WIDE for my hanging files! At first, I tried bending the metal pieces to come together more, but then the hanging files would only fit in the middle and they couldn't slide back and forth easily. Then, I realized that if I flipped the plastic pieces on one side, then the file folders would fit. While I eventually figured it out and it works for me now, I would not purchase again just because of the difficult assembly process and because of the fact that it's not continually adjustable if I wanted to move this to drawers in the future.
1,worked for a few days and then my printer rejected them and the error messages said they were damaged.
1,This is the worst ink and the most expensive ink I have ever had. It barely lasts and I rarely print on it. I will not be buying another Kodak printer again. You are better off with a laser printer.
1,These refills are two dollars each, yet you can purchase the entire pen for one dollar and ten cents elsewhere on Amazon.
1,This printer worked well for the first six months but now its constantly having problems. It prints less than a quarter of the page then prints a quarter of the next page. Im constantly getting error messages but nothing is jammed and it has ink and paper. I wish I bought it at Costco because they would take this piece of garbage back.
1,It does the job but it puts the sharp edge in  first contact with the  paper making it catch a break often it would be good it it was 0.7 lead  Good concept but I don't like it at 0.3 size thicker lead size would be the way to go you can see in the photo it got caught up on the f
1,Poorly designed and poorly built.  A cheap, too small plastic "x" with four unsightly sticks protruding from its ends to supposedly hold the computer in place.  You can't lock the "x" to hold the computer in place.  At the end the comouter ends up literally hanging from this undersized contraption.  Any attempt to move it (the wheels are a joke) will just open the "x" and make the computer fall.  A useless piece of junk.
1,Burns thru Pricey Ink
1,be aware that these are very tiny rolls of tape, quite the rip off
1,Did not work for us
1,Panasonic KX-TGA20B DECT 6.0 Key Detector ...	Panasoni does not work and it never did.
1,This product is unsatisfactory.		The scale is not accurate. The squares are sligtly larger than they should be, resulting in unacceptable cumulative errors.
1,So the name should be PAYUSA...  Checked the whole website and nowhere indicates that unless you have a SSN you can not open an account.  It should learn from PayPal and Amazon to value the international customers
1,I purchased this ink cartridge on the basis of the positive reviews it was given. Well, there were no issues with the cartridge upon installation. The ink quality is good. I have a HP Photosmart C7280 All-in-One which can show you the ink level remaining on the cartridges. It showed this cartridge half full. Maybe that's why it's so cheap; you get half the ink.
1,This was my first time buying sharpie pens on amazon and certainly from this vendor.  Got these today and used them.  8 out of the 12 dried up/quit working within about 20 minutes of beginning to use each one.  I've never had that happen before-- I've used Sharpie pens for years and they've always lasted forever.  I'm never buying these again from this vendor.
1,First time I've tried a non-manufacturer cartridge.  One leaked after a month and the other stopped printing after about a hundred pages, seemingly with ink remaining (by weight, compared to an empty OEM cartridge).  I liked the price, but can't afford to have unreliable printing, so back to OEM I go.
1,I return it as soon as I used it the first time because it broke after 15 minutes of using it!
1,This item is NOT for optical mice.  Only use with rollerball type mouse. There is no response from an optical device.  Well made and it looks great otherwise. -John
1,Soon after installation it started to squeal with each print, the second one did the same thing. Also don't seem to be getting the expected number of prints.
1,In purchased this item before and it was boxed nicely and no problems . This time no box just shrink wrap! Warped and I am not even sure if my printer will actually print on these without messing up! Sadly cheap product! Not the quality o got last time! Will NOT purchase again
1,One of the pens came exploded in the package and leaked on a few others. Pens felt poorly made while writing with them. Ink inside was fine just didn't seem to be comfortable using them. Amazon customer service refunded me
1,What to say about this tape.	There is no starting point and we fussed with the rolls for FAR too long.	Again, they were a science purchase and were very frustrating.	When we got them started they ripped sideways and again were very frustrating.
1,hard to open
1,The 3M Tilt-Adjustable Gel Wrist Rest Platform claims that it encourages a comfortable, neutral wrist position. Like many people, I spend a lot of time on my computer so I'm always eager to try out any product that helps with comfort and ergonomics. Does the 3M WR420LE's performance justify the high cost? Let's find out.		PLATFORM	The platform is the only feature that separates this product from plain wrist rests. It's a strong plastic platform to place your keyboard onto. There's space in front for the included padded wrist rest and two sets of rubber feet are also included. I assume the rubber feet are why 3M describes the platform as being adjustable, but I wouldn't call it truly adjustable since you can't adjust them on-the-fly.		The rubber feet come in two sizes and attach to the bottom of the platform, using 3M adhesive. Attaching them to the rear of the platform for a positive tilt is easy, since there are templates, indicating where to put them. Every single keyboard I've ever used, except for Kinesis Contour keyboards, had positive tilt feet/legs. The true benefit of the 3M platform is its ability to produce a negative tilt. Unfortunately, if you want the platform on a negative tilt, you'll have to eyeball the rubber feet on your own; 3M forgot to include templates for negative tilt feet.		WRIST REST	The included wrist rest is very, very nice. It has antimicrobial protection and is filled with a not-too-soft, but not-too-hard gel. The wrist rest is wrapped in a soft, leather-like material and is by far, the most comfortable and durable I've ever used. I ended up just tossing the platform to the side and using the wrist rest by itself.		CONCLUSION	My experience with the 3M Tilt-Adjustable Gel Wrist Rest Platform was rather disappointing. It's not truly adjustable and 3M failed to provide templates for accurately attaching the rubber feet for negative tilt. If not for the wonderful wrist rest that was included, I would have rated it even less. The thing is, you can buy the wrist rest by itself, for less than half the cost of this platform/wrist rest combo. I suggest you do just that and forget about the platform.
1,This worked OK.  If you have to use a regular phone (landline) it wasn't meant to be used for VOIP calls.  They don't tell you that in the comments.  I used this after getting rid of a 2nd line I use for business out of my home.  It saved me $75 a month from AT&T...that I truly hate!~	It was an easy hookup and set up, but after about the first few calls eeryone kept saying they couldn't hear me.  I could hear them fine however.  It turns out that this was a total waste of moneyh.  I ordered 2 of them (one for my husband desk and one for mine) and now they are of zero use to me and its too late to return them.	I opted instead to buy the VOIP phone by OBI and I just got that today.  It doesnt NEED this adapter and so it plugs right into my router.  I haven't had it long enough to leave a review yet.
1,It didn't work.  Called manufacturer and had to mail it to them.  They promptly replaced product with the same model.  The second one works great for the price.  I use it at work.  It's reliable and works well for my use.
1,Disappointed	The barrel that let leads out is loose
1,Very disappointed in this product , doesent hold for  anything, not worth the money spent, would not recommend.
1,I have mixed feelings about this thing. Can't beat the monthly price (which is just tax---it runs about 4 bucks a month for the basic service, which is all I need). The voice quality is adequate, but Vonage is actually a bit better (though more expensive). If you spring for the fancier level of service (about $10/month), you can both filter out and blacklist spam callers, and also block all calls without caller ID, which vastly improves my life around dinner time.		The device itself is not well thought out at all, however. For example, If you just plug it into an existing network (as compared to plugging it into your modem and then running all your network traffic through the Oooma---which I don't recommend), then the only way to get at the telo configuration system is by running a physical network cable between a computer and the telo's LAN port.  This isn't the end of the world, but it's annoying.		Anoyingly, the Telo supports two phone lines, but only one of them is output to the hard-wired phone port, so a two-line phone won't work with this thing. You need to buy another device (the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ooma-Linx/dp/B00A35WSEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ooma Linx</a>) to get wired access to the second line.		The Ooma handset lets you answer both lines, but it is, unfortunately, also not well thought out. You have to wade through menus to do things that are a single button press on most telephones, it's difficult to join an existing call, etc. The only thing the handset does for you is let you switch between lines more easily, but even that requires too many button presses. Without the handset, however, you can't make an outgoing call on line 2 unless you're physically near the Telo.		The bluetooth support is particularly miserable. For example, you can't transfer ongoing calls to and from a bluetooth headset and a handset, so if you need to navigate a menu system, you're hosed. You also have to dial special codes to make an outgoing call and hear it on the headset.  I solved the headset problem with a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Plantronics-Calisto-P835-M-Speaker-Phone/dp/B005SNMMKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Plantronics Calisto P835-M Speaker Phone</a>&nbsp;(actually, I didn't get the -M version because I use a mac). Hooked up to the Telo, the Plantronics is a spectacular device that solves the headset problem elegantly, hooks up to your computer so that you can use it with Skype (provided that you download the "spokes" software from Plantronics), and provides a crystal-clear speakerphone.		Finally, my burgler alarm doesn't work with the ooma. Ooma uses a "cool" but nonstandard dial tone, and the alarm doesn't recognize their dial-tone-like-sound as an actual dial tone, so won't connect. The Vonage modem didn't have that problem.
1,If you want a great printer, this will be the printer for you.  If you want a great scanner and fax machine, look somewhere else.  I'm sure they would work, but the ability of this machine to jam almost every time is unparalleled!  Wow.		If you want to use the fax machine or scanner with a single document, it works fine (you scan it on the flatbed scanner).  If you have a document with more than one page, it will jam on the second page pretty consistently.  I realize that there are problems from time to time, but if you're looking for a company that stands behind their products, you may want to look somewhere else as well.		We've had problems from day one with the scanner, but Samsung is not willing to fix or replace the defective product unless we want to ship it back and pay the cost to send a VERY heavy piece back to them...and they'll look at it to see if it's something covered under warranty.  Amazon was better art replacing the printer, and we were surprised to find the exact same problem on printer #2, and then printer #3!  (Starting to see a trend?)		Bottom line: Not worth paying the price of a multifunction printer if you only really get one of the functions.  Not worth the price Samsung charges if Samsung isn't willing to stand behind their products.  We were so disappointed that we have avoided all Samsung products since this started, not just multifunction-priced monofunction printers.
1,It's made out of a very thin, low quality material. I expected it to be made out of the same durable material as any other pocket chart, but it's not.
1,I can hundreds of jars of food per year from my large garden.  I am also a bit obsessive compulsive and wanted all my jars to be labeled neatly and in an aesthetically pleasing manner.  I also loved the idea of labeling the disposable jar top not the glass which would require me to scrub adhesive off the mason jar. I consider myself to be computer savvy and I have advanced knowledge of Microsoft Office but it was impossible to get these labels to line up with my printer.  I went through  the calibration process but I wasted quite a bit of this product and it's just to expensive to do so.
1,Cheapo	Tin sound. But I only bought it for a fax line
1,These are supposed to be high quality pens, but they run dry after a few uses even though there is plenty of ink left in the cartridge.
1,Okay. These labels are horrible. I am very disappointed in these. I had ordered them for work, and the ink would not dry (even after 24 hours of dry time). These are supposed to be water proof however we tested that claim after the 24 hour dry time by running it under the sink faucet. The ink came right off. I would return them, but we tried it a few different times, and threw away the shipping box. Do not buy these, do not waste your money. Avery has some work to do on their end before this is considered a decent product.
1,These are horrible.  It says that it's a gold shadow.  They come in silver shadow too.  But, you color with. let's say green.  As it dries, it is now silver or gold with no trace of the green.
1,I bought 3 sets of ink, which contains a total of 6 Black cartridges.  I have a new WF 3540 Epson printer.  The color EZ ink cartridges, at least the 3 I put in work fine, but the Black cartridges cause an error on the printer.  I found that 2 of the black cartridges had NO ink in them, 2 only printed about 20 fax pages before running out of ink and the last 2 caused the printer to error out and I couldn't override the "Non-Epson" product override option, it would cause the print head to freak out and lock up the printer.	I also have a WF 3520 which I have been using a different re-manufactured ink and never had a problem.  They cost about 10 per cent more, but never had a bad one.	I will not purchase from this company again, their black cartridges are complete garbage - with 2 of the six shipping without ink, and 2 more with almost no ink in them and the last 2 not working in the printer at all.	I sent an email to their company with no response after a week, even though they state they respond within 24 hours.
1,Did not like the quality.
1,I spent two days attempting to get this printer to work with my laptop. Even a late evening telephone session with a (surly) Samsung technician yielded no success. It might have helped if the installation instructions came in English (some of the pictures were labeled in English but the step-by-step directions were printed in every language but English). I suspect that I bought a "gray market" version, but considering that it came from Office Max that would be quite surprising.		I was able to get it work -- briefly and/or occasionally -- but a subsequent re-boot of my computer consistently rendered it -- and several of my installed software programs -- absolutely unuseable. This is the first piece of hardware I've ever installed on my laptop which has exhibited this stubbornness, or affected my other programs in this way. Even my older Samsung ML-2250 laser installs on my laptop and works flawlessly (a really wonderful printer, by the way, that has served me faithfully in a law office setting since 2004).		When I was able to get the printer to work (usually for no more than a few minutes), it was sloooooww! Also, you cannot print envelopes on this printer -- labels only, and then only on 8 1/2 by 11 size sheets of labels.		I had really hoped this printer would work for me. It is a convenient size, and quite handsome in its black case. Not to be...alas!
1,Don't order this! The protection of the item is TERRIBLE! Every one of the ten boards came in damaged and dented. Just go to a physical store and order it yourself...
1,Low quality.	Clear plastic bin fronts and handles are easily broken.	The short stubs on the bins that allow bin to pivot out and hold in place are easily broken off.	If the unit was more robust it would be very functional allowing easy ID and access to the contents.
1,Product ok but they are way over priced.
1,Not what I expected.  If you want it to write or color in different colors you have to turn the pencil.  The points are small and strange.
1,The tape itself is ok - strong enough, thick enough not to tear apart - but the plastic holder doesn't dispense the tape easily. I end up needing two hands to pull the tape out and even then it's difficult with a lot of stops and starts. Very unpleasant.		I bought this because it's more economical than the Scotch Tape than I generally use but I won't buy it again. I can't wait until it's all used up and I don't need to deal with it any longer.
1,Not what i expected.
1,This is nothing but a cheap re-badged Brother printer. It comes with all the same problems that have plagued recent Brother models. "Deep sleep" mode is like a coma for printers that will keep the machine from printing wirelessly. Even after turning that off, many buyers suffer difficulties with wifi  printing with this machine. Print quality is spotty, literally spotty, as it will frequently leave a streak of ink spots on your freshly printed page. If you want a Brother printer, buy this. If you've had a bad Brother and are seeking a better alternative, avoid this one.
1,I'd actually give this a 2 1/2 star rating because before it messed up it was a great product.  Excellent printing, much better than any other printer I've had.  Unfortunately one day for no reason it decided it had a paper jam.  No paper was even in it.  I checked it over then took it to a repair guy and there's nothing that can be done.  HP has been difficult to work with through this whole thing.  A two year old printer that cost as much as this one should not just crap out on me.  All it is is a sensor error, a sensor should be replaceable for a reasonable price so I can get it fixed locally or even do it myself.  This is either going to pollute some third world country if it is garbage or HP is going to refurbish it again (yes, I got it refurbished as a gift)  and sell it to someone else for like $350.  Who knows how many times this printer has had this issue; how many times it has been resold.
1,Does not fit my parker or waterman, the description universal is misleading.
1,I have been a big fan of the Canon portable printers for years.  My I80 died after a few years (great service) and I purchased the IP100.  What a disappointment.  Paper feed is terrible, the print quality in black text is very poor.  How does a company go backwards in product development?		Update 1/18/11		After three calls into Canon tech support, Canon finally sent a replacement printer.  Upon the first attempt at printing with the brand new printer, the paper jammed and red streaks through the photos on the page that did print.  What a piece of junk Canon is producing.  I actually found an I90 on ebay and purchased that.  Don't buy this junk!
1,I have NEVER been able to use this to make more than one sticker!!!  I've owned and been able to use many craft tools over the past 45 years, (some quite complicated like my Viking Designer SE computer embroidery machine) but this little x-shaped adhesive applicator tool has me totally stumped!!!  I have wasted several cartridges trying to get it to work like it should.  I've watched the videos on YouTube and it looks so easy.  Other reviewers on here are saying their small children enjoy using it!  What am I doing wrong?  If it worked like it should, I would give it at least four stars (and maybe even five).
1,I bought these pens because I was familiar with gel pens by them and liked them very much. This pen skips. I'm not very impressed with this product so far.
1,Not sticky and not clear. So one would assume when buying an Avery product there is likely to be some decent quality but I found this did not meet the description or my expectations.  I used it to print custom wording to stick to card-stock for scrapbooking. Firstly the paper when peeled off the backing is not clear, but a matt opaque.  Secondly the paper does not stick - the adhesive is less sticky that a post it note and the paper quickly peels off the cardstock (within minutes).  I used other adhesive to make the paper stick.  The price for THREE sheets is unreasonable, apparently you are paying for the "cd" of stock images but definately a waste of money all around.
1,When my beloved (and very tired) Epson R200 finally died (with a cryptic error message about some part "reaching the end of its service life") after printing literally thousands of DVDs over four years, I purchased the 260 as a replacement. It improves on the R200 in some respects, holds its ground on others, and is a major disappointment in several important ways.		It improves a bit on the R200 in the manner in which it handles disc printing. The tray is more durable, and no longer protrudes from the back of the printer while moving in and out. The visible guides are better, and the loading path is improved.		But a small lever, which raises and lowers the disc tray, is something of a noisy annoyance. Whenever the tray is adjusted, the printer can be heard making a mechanical adjustment inside, and this takes a few seconds. If you insert the disc tray too soon, bad things happen... And, in a puzzling software choice, if you try to print on paper while the tray is down, instead of caching the print job until the tray is raised (like the earlier model), now the job gets deleted and you have to print from your application again after raising the tray. Likewise, if you try to print a disc when the tray is up, the job evaporates and you must print again once the tray is lowered. This is really annoying. I used to stack up jobs onto various media, and then just adjust the tray as necessary once each job finished. That's not possible with this printer.		This printer holds ground in the print quality, which is excellent, but not noticeably different from the earlier printer (neither better nor worse), despite a bunch of marketing noise about print quality improvements. The driver software also combines the settings for regular paper and bright white paper. This is a bad idea which leads to slightly faded and over-saturated prints on regular paper, but no noticeable improvement on bright white paper.		Also, the driver still makes the user select between text-only, text-with-graphics, and the various photo modes. This is cumbersome. The driver should be able to tell if a document is all text or a combination of text and graphics. Offering selections for relative photo quality is fine, but the other options are unintuitive and unnecessary. The driver also still whines about printing borderless photos. If your printer claims to be able to do this, don't make your user click through dialog boxes containing warnings about reduced print quality at the edges.		The printer is much worse than its predecessor in three key areas.		First, it's much larger. You will need much more room on your desktop than with the earlier models. I can see no reason why it needs to be bigger.		Second, it's much noisier. All of the print modes are loud, and the paper feeding mechanism is especially loud. This is partly because the case is mostly hollow and acts like a drum, amplifying the sound of every moving part.		Third, and most disappointing, this model sucks down ink at a much faster rate than its predecessor. One would think that, after losing a class action lawsuit over ink handling issues, Epson would have made some changes. But whatever changes were made only make it worse.		Unlike earlier models, this printer seems to go through cleaning/warm-up cycles much more frequently, even if the printer is left on and no clean-up is requested. I'm routinely shocked to see ink levels in all colors drop by large margins when simply printing black text disc labels. This is completely unacceptable.		A key thing to notice is that it uses colored inks even when printing only black. I don't know if the color cartridges are used in combination with the black cartridge, or if ink is simply passing through them for some other reason. Either way, it's very, very bad -- and very, very expensive.		I had a full set of cartridges on hand when my R200 died, and simply exchanged them for cartridges for this printer. The price was exactly the same. Yet the new printer seems to go through the ink much, much faster. And, like earlier models, it's still impossible to continue printing if even one of the color cartridges is empty. That's just unacceptable after all the complaints users have lodged about this issue.		Overall, I'm disappointed. It works as advertised, but my costs per disc have gone up when they really should have gone down. And the quiet of my studio is often rudely interrupted by the noise this printer makes. It's unlikely that I'll stick with this printer as long as the last one. Epson is shooting themselves in the foot with high ink consumption and high ink prices. Short term, it will make more money. But long term, it will lose customers and all the money they might have given them.		**UPDATE**		I've now had this printer for six months, using it almost every single day. I've printed hundreds of DVDs (the only reason I bought it). My disappointment continues to grow.		There are numerous new bugs in the driver, including inexplicable spinning and whirring inside the printer (an extremely loud process which can take five minutes or more to clear), flashing red lights with no apparent problem (which clear themselves with a power down cycle), rejecting the second disc when printing more than one copy of the same thing (requiring a power down and manual clearing of the print queue), strange pop-up balloon messages in the system tray (coming from the driver itself), and others too weird to document.		I did discover that you can turn off the print monitor and it will stop jumping in front of all your applications. This also regains the ability to stack up jobs on various media then adjust the printer right before each one starts. But by doing this you lose the ability to see which ink cartridges are low. And if one of them runs out while the printer monitor is off, good luck figuring out which one it is. (Hint: You can get to it through the control panel.)		Note that these are all SOFTWARE related problems. Hardware-wise, I haven't really had many problems. I do get many more clogged nozzles with this technology than with the previous type, and have to clean more often (which, annoyingly, cannot be done if one of the ink cartridges is low). It's really no longer possible to use a cartridge until it is actually empty -- just another way that this printer turns out to be a money-grubber.		But over time, it has turned out that actual costs aren't as substantially increased as I originally feared. My original guess would have been about a 25-30% increase. In actuality it's only about 10-15% more expensive. That's still terrible, but not as terrible as I originally feared. (And be prepared to have at least one red light -- the "ink low" indicator -- flashing at all times. It rarely goes out because it's hardly ever the case that none of the cartridges are low.)		I do also print invoices, mailing labels (with bar codes) and receipts using this printer. It's a good thing I have a separate laser printer for letters and other documents which need to look really good because, while photo quality is comparable to its predecessor, the text production is substantially worse (albeit much faster). Rarely do I get a document without some row of text being blurry.		Though I didn't mention it originally, it should be noted that the Epson PrintCD software hasn't had an upgrade of any sort with this printer. It's still every bit as rudimentary and clumsy as it's always been. On the one hand this is a good thing because I didn't have to learn any new idiosyncrasies. On the other hand, it's far from a full-featured application. It's more like an applet (Paintbrush for disc printing, if you will) which will frustrate even the most patient user. Calling it "under-powered" would be a compliment.		And, one final note: Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that disc printing is almost exactly the same speed as with the earlier printer. Faster disc printing would have been on my wish list, and that wish would not have been granted.		Having said all that, it IS cheap. What is so frustrating is that it's SO CLOSE to being a great printer -- maybe 90% of the way there (the R200 was about 98% of the way there). But the little things (and a couple of big things) really weigh it down. You may already know this, but Epson is really the only company making such economical disc printers. That's too bad because I'd drop them in a heartbeat if there were a worthy competitor.		** UPDATE February 2008 **		Alas, this printer died -- and much faster than its predecessor. It was an ungraceful death, much like its life. One day the lights all started flashing and the software reported that all the cartridges were empty. New cartridges were not recognized.		Since it was within a year, I was able under warranty to swap it for a reconditioned replacement unit. But because I couldn't wait the three weeks this took, I had to go out and buy another disc printer right away. After a quick search, I was stuck buying another Epson, the RX595. The disc printing part is identical, but the new model also has a scanner (which actually explains why the line has gotten so large -- they're making them all so that a scanner can simply be stuck on top).		Look for my review of the RX595 soon.
1,The plastic is brittle and breaks easily, Used in a classroom and was not durable at all. For home light use only.
1,Does not last as long as OEM. Will not buy it again.
1,It was great for a few weeks. It recharged my devices through the USB connections with no problems. However, the sharpener did not last. When it worked, it sharpened to a nice point. Now it will not sharpen at all. Too bad as it was nice while it lasted.
1,I do not personally recommend these pens.  The only benefit to these pens is that they are cute to look at.  These pens do not flow well when used. I also had issues with the tip allowing ink to flow, thus I had skipping with multiple colors.  The pens are lightweight to hold. When compared to other more well known brands of pens these are of poor quality. They do look good on a desk but isn't practical enough for me to seriously consider using over my beloved pentel and Bic fine pens.
1,I bought this device to share a printer between my two PC's. One runs Windows XP and the other Vista Home Premium. Setup was a breeze and the printer works perfectly. Switching is automatic so I can even "hide" the switch.		So why am I only giving this device one star? Simple. After spending over two weeks trying to figure out why my XP machine no longer recognizes any of my digital cameras or thumb drives, I traced the problem back to this switch.		Removing this switch from my system resulted in everything going back to normal.		Yes, it does allow a USB device to be shared by two PC's. However, whatever is going on inside this thing is causing hardware conflicts. Needless to say, I am looking for another brand of switch and relegating this thing to the trash can.		Proceed with caution as this switch may cause more problems than it solves.		I see that J. Mantz also reviewed this product and appears to have had the same problem. This may not be a universal issue, but I am obviously not alone in running into the problem.
1,Pads are really nice quality paper, and great to write on.  Unfortunately, one of the three arrived with a corner all brunches in.  The other two were fine, so it had to have gone out this way.  Never enough time to do it right, but lots of time to do it over.  A real pain to repackage and return.
1,The printer will not print unless the cartridge is from LexMark.
1,It's not the function of the tape so much as the static electricity 'magnetic attraction' the end of the tape has to the tape remaining on the spool. Before you can secure the end to the little edge near the cutter, it can confoundingly adhere itself to the roll.	If you enjoy a good fight (searching for the end of the tape when you scarcely have time to wrap a gift), and groove on a battle similar to finding the end on a roll of plastic food wrap, this be the stuff for you!  Ultimately it is faster to pinch the brackets holding the tape in the dispenser and remove the tape,  score it, dig at it with your fingernails, and created a new end.	This is the kind of thing that has made gift bags supremely popular and made gift wrapping an almost lost art, especially with gift bags and tissue available at dollar stores.  The tape is probably easier to use if purchased as a larger roll for a heavy-duty desk top dispenser. Otherwise, approach the typical disposable dispenser as the cantankerous little critter that it is, and be determined to avoid its tricks.
1,JUNK. Wouldn't make it thru the first hole without breaking. Never seen something made so poorly
1,Not very good.  I bought a 4-pack to replace the original ink in a Parker Sonnet and a Conklin Glider (both twist pens).  The new refills worked fine for a week or so and since that time have begun skipping horribly after extended writing.  For the last couple of weeks, I've been conducting job interviews which take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour.  When I get about halfway through my paperwork, the pens begin skipping and as a result I'm missing/messing up my notes while trying to take down what someone is saying in short-hand.  It appears to happen mostly on cheap office notebook paper (the scratchy, fibrous, recycled junk) although I just had the skipping occur on the better quality printer paper we use.  I'm at a loss but I'll be replacing with something else soon, likely a Space Pen refill.  This is a shame because when the refills do work properly, they lay a nice, bold, smooth blue line.
1,Very slow.
1,This is the fastest inkjet printer I have ever seen. I have clocked it at 20 ppm. WiFi setup was the easiest I have ever setup for any printer. Color is sharp and crisp and blacks are solid and true. Handles #10 envelopes with ease. Quick delivery great product all round.		Update: It was the best printer I ever had for 7 months, then about a 1 inch band of light color about every 1 1/2 inches. I tried cleaning the heads several times but can't clear them. The printer is now unusable.
1,Not sure if it's the design or the blades aren't sharp, but these require a lot more attention to alignment to get the cut started cleanly and stay "on track"		I don't want to focus that hard to open the mail...
1,The printer works good so far, but it was such a PITA finding the drivers for it. It took over two hours for me to get it set up because they have the drivers for win7 64 bit hidden very well. I had to go to the "self help" support section to finally find them, since typing in the model number in their driver section did nothing. Clicking on their down load link in the section you find for the printer only came back with a 404 error. I don't know if other versions for win8 or 10 are that hard to find. Also, after all that it wouldn't feed the paper through. I finally pulled out the toner cartridge to find a piece of the orange plastic inside you take out unpacking it had come off and was keeping the paper from feeding. I've seen people complaining about the paper not feeding and jamming all the time, they might have had that piece break off too and it's interfering.		*****Update 7-17-17******	I spend more time running back and forth seeing if it printed than I do actually printing anything. It constantly gives me print errors. Constantly. And the buttons on top? They do nothing. The feed paper button can be pushed over and over and it will not feed any paper. I regret this purchase 100% and next time I buy a printer it will absolutely not be a cannon.
1,Well, it just didn't work well for me.  I followed the instructions but the stamp never printed evenly after inking.  I finally just ordered a new stamp .
1,Chews up corners.  Jams.  Isn't wi-fi compatible.  Just doesn't do the job I need.
1,I'd assume that this pencil sharpener is designed and manufactured to work with Prismacolor pencils.  It may be me - I don't have much gripping strength - but none of my expensive Prismacolor pencils have sharpened evenly using this device, and since the lead of these pricey pencils is invariably broken inside the casing, this sharpener quickly clogs up with lead and wood shavings and it is a chore to pick out the detritus.  I prefer my old electric Swingline sharpener.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who has any gripping problems, it actually is painful trying to use this product.  In disappointment, I threw this pencil sharpener in the trash.
1,Go with hp. This was a waste of money.  First unit stopped working.  Replacement was a refurb that prints a day later.
1,was not able to use this
1,The pen arrived in the box but without the stylus attached to the one end.  I asked that the stylus be shipped to make the pen totally useful.  I hope that is done rather than having to ship this back and then wait for a new one.
1,Well, you get what you paid for. And you get plenty. But there is no real black in this paper so the result will look a little faded. It's crappy for images, but for only text it works OK. Don't waste time on it if you want it for photography, but if you're just printing signs for you office door or something, it works...		Low gamut and no black.
1,barely held 1 piece of paper.  Amazon promptly refunded.
1,These did not work for me. They where empty. I will not purchase these again.
1,If you print envelopes, you don't want this printer.  There is no way to print an envelope without removing all the paper from the main tray, re-adjusting the guides, and adding envelopes.  It would be nice if the document feeder or second tray could be used.		If you plan on scanning, you don't want this printer.  All scans, even those document set squarely on the glass, scan crooked to the point that their corners are cut off.		Otherwise, for simple printing it's okay.
1,Arrived shattered into pieces.
1,Although it's working, it's already reading low.  I paid twice as much for this one as some of the others out there (that also have prime shipping) and thought the yield would be higher.		In fact, I thought this was a double pack as they show two toners and a large box.  I was in a hurry and paid for it.		Good comments: they shipped it super fast!!!  It does work fine too.  It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.
1,I cannot recommend these pencils, the lead breaks off very easily when they are sharpened, I have a hard time trying to keep them sharpened.  I had wanted a soft colored pencil to use in my Adult Coloring books.
1,sorry but doesn't work with printing on waterproof labels for my business, it smudges. so i need to return it.
1,I have been wanting an automatic pencil sharpener for school. The iPoint ball pencil sharpener by Westcott is really cute. It is shiny and looks like a high quality desk accessory.		This sharpener makes a perfect point. But, it is not heavy enough to sharpen the pencil without the sharpener spinning around. So you have to hold the pencil and the sharpener. After a few go rounds I realize that it is pointless to have an automatic sharpener that you have to hold anyway. So I ended up taking the batteries out and just using it as a manual sharpener. It makes a great point and it looks fantastic. But I still don't have an automatic pencil sharpener.
1,I am highly upset! I opened the box to find Sharpie Pens!!!!!
1,it looks nice, but this plastic is tacky, like the toys of the same material. my wrist sticks to it every time, and when i remove my wrist, it is shiney and sticky too.
1,I placed the order on February 7, 2018.  I did not receive the paper for 2 and 1/2 weeks and when I did the box was all beaten up. Not acceptable.
1,Doesn't work and the tape snapped apart my first time using it!
1,These pencils are hard to use in my class-on fabric, the color is light, pencils do not give up enough color!  I bought this brand for a few colors I did not have in other brands.  I'll go back to my dependable Crayola pencils!
1,do not like the verathin.....
1,tried 4 colors black blue orange and red to use on plastic nothing covered what i wanted to refresh the items. supposedly permanent, not true could see thru the items that i used pens on.
1,They sent me a used pen on top of every thing else. It had blue ink stains in the barrel. I know why the previous owner returned it. First it stinks like vomit. The vegan plastic is dreadful. (Please just make it out of carnivore plastic from now on?) Durr. I don't need a biodegradable fountain pen. I plan on using this pen for life. Why would I want it to biodegrade? Second the ink flow is awful-dripping and pouring to not flowing at all. The next thing is I do not think the design of the pen is sound. You sell me a $25 pen and in the instructions tell me it won't work right,but I can slap a bit of scotch tape on it to fix it? Really??? Addendem: After using thid pen for a few weeks, the "vegan plastic" is cracking and peeling. What a complete rip off this pen is.
1,The Con 40 might be good if it would fill all the way but so far that hasn't happened with mine.		Edit: I have since cleaned two of these converters, one with alcohol, then both with a little detergent and water. Neither one of the pair I bought will fill more than just above the bottom stop, so less than half a load..
1,My previous model was a Purple Cow that just wore out after several years of use, mainly for making nametags and flannelboard characters on a weekly basis.  I decided to try Swingline - what a mistake!		My 4 major disappointments in this Swingline model by comparison with my previous Purple Cow model:	01 - This heats up VERRRY SLOW.  The manufacturer's "heats up fast" claim is far from the truth.	02 - It's difficult to feed straight.  My Purple Cow had a convenient feed tray that lined up my projects beautifully.	03 - This is already losing its heat, and I've only owned it a year.  Less heat, poor bonding.  Running a project through twice is of no avail.	04 - Finally, Swingline was more expensive than my previous more successful Purple Cow model.		I will never purchase another Swingline laminator after this extremely disappointing experience.
1,Both of them cane off and i couldn't fix them.
1,I don't know what others use these for, but for adult coloring books they are HORRIBLE! Maybe for scrapbooking or posters or something, but not for more fine detailed work. I have posted pictures. The consistency is thick and messy. Think of nail polish. It runs over black lines, and some didn't work. They had to be forced with scribbling. As you can see from my pictures, 2 pens that had never been uncapped leaked. I am baffled by all the 5-star reviews! I am very upset that a fairy picture that I thought would look wonderful using these pens was completely ruined, and I had to throw it away!!! One lesson learned, I will make copies of all my pictures from books I order. I will stick with ultra fine felt tip pens by Stabilo and Prismacolor. Gel pens I've used at work are horrible too. They just are not reliable and consistent. Lesson learned! At least I'm getting my money back.
1,It works after you shake it around,  cheaply made junk
1,Online it says: ...any drawer length.  It actually only fits 23+.  I needed this item to be 18 in length.  Im very upset that Im unable to use this product and will now have to buy another.
1,2 pieces missing.  Box says 10, there were 8.  They are red, white, and blue.  Not pink as the box depicts.
1,This print head does not work.  Even though we just replaced it, it will not line up and kicks out an additional sheet of paper each time I print something.  It is wasting my expensive ink and my paper.
1,did not perform the way I thought it should;  the jaw does not allow for 20 or even 10 sheets of paper; very much let down considering the price...
1,Not happy with these pens. They don't write very well. Ink does not come out consistently. The black pen was broken straight out of the box.	They do not have a fiscars logo printed on the pens . No name at all. Thats kind of strange. Fiskars is a good brand normally but not this time.
1,I hate these. They are pockets but the have a weird construction and the pocket bottoms don't fold down/out properly. Won't buy these again.
1,When I grab a pen to take down a phone number or take down I confirmation number, I want it to work.  Not scribbling furiously to make such a basic action take place.  Colder climate just makes them worse.  The feel on these is also cheap and light.  I was not expecting perfection by any means for this low price.  But they do need to function.
1,I purchased the remanufactured black and colored ink cartridges because they were offered. I am very disappointed that after trying to print a picture that only a faint yellow color came out using the color ink. I haven't tried the black ink yet. My printer registers that my color ink level is running on empty.
1,Only could give this product 2 stars.  With the way the pad curves in at the middle provides no support when typing for your left hand.  It's too bad because the pad itself is pretty good.  Not sure what the thinking was to make the pad curve in....
1,This printer seems well built and solid but the software package that comes with it is terrible!		The software wouldn't SCAN properly and reported memory errors at resolutions over 600dpi.  The HP software loads each time you boot the computer and runs in the background and causes other unrelated computer functions to S-L-O-W down (2.6 Ghz Celeron machine with 768 Meg RAM).  When shutting the computer down for the night, the HP software would cause it to hang with a message that the HP software was not responding - even during sessions when the HP software wasn't used at all.		I called HP tech support 3 times and worked with them for hours and hours.  HP's solution is to uninstall and reinstall the software over and over and over again on each machine on the network.		I returned the machine after 1 week.
1,Cannot produce high-quality, clear decals.  All of the decals I produced had a white film on them, even when I followed the instructions completely.  Would not recommend, except for use in low-quality situations.
1,There are really only two virtues of this device.  1.  It looks cute with is pastel buttons.  2.  It is TWAIN compliant.		Other than that, it is not that great.  I had a lot of issue in regards to scanning credit card receipts as they would constantly jam in the feed mechanism.  You do have the option to open up the back to create a straight throughput, but in my Dilbert-esque cubicle, there is no space towards the rear of the scanner. I am sure that if your receipt were in perfect condition it wouldn't have an issue, but mine have been in my wallet or pocket, and so get a little wrinkled and that ends up jamming in the scanner.  There is also a third party software, Kofax, that is used for the scanning.  The instructions that I received mandated that I install that first and then the CD that came with the Canon. The instructions on installing the various components is confusing and frustrating as I am no computer expert.  The most retarded part is that using the Kofax application nullifies your ability to capture the image using the button on the scanner. But the quality of the scanned images were good, as well as the speed.		Overall, if you are scanning mostly 8.5 x 11 paper documents, this scanner should do the job. But this hardly justifies paying a premium on the price.  I use a Fujitsu ScanSnap at home and it is far superior in performance to the scanner in regards to ease of use, jam rate, and bundled with Adobe Acrobat.
1,I received my order within a few days however was quite disappointed when I open the package and saw that the only things in it that were as advertised was the binder and the index stickers.		The description stated that the paper was college ruled it also indicated that would be 10 address pages and 10 note pages, however the paper is wide ruled and I did not have the 10 address pages, nor were the 10 note pages included.	I would not have ordered it had I known those things were not there. I abhor wide ruled paper!!  I don't know if it was a mistake that all of the things were not included or if the description was to entice. Had they been there I would very likely order this product again, but unless the manufacturer corrects the rrror I won't.
1,It's a pen. It's a wide pen that's just a bit too wide to be comfortable. The feel of writing with it is a bit weird. Almost too little friction. My handwriting is even worse with this pen due to the diameter of the barrel and the low drag of the nib. Like trying to walk on ice. I like a little friction. (That's what she said!) From all the other reviews, you'd think this pen would not only write in the weightlessness of space, but might also go to the dentist for you and do your taxes for free. It's just a pen. I prefer the feel of something like the Pilot EasyTouch. It's just crazy to me that with all the pens there are to choose from, so many of them are just crap. So something like this unremarkable pen gets rave reviews. Welcome to the mediocrity that is the future.		* * * UPDATE * * *	Several days later, and I hate this pen. It is not smooth. Makes my writing look like I've got some kind of stimulant addiction. Makes me angry, actually, that this thing gets such good reviews. I guess I have stocking stuffers for my worthless kids if the state ever gives them back. Kidding. About the kids. Not the pens.		I'll never get my kids back.
1,Seller solicited me for a review, so here you go.		Cool Toner works just fine. I wish they would use a consistent box design so I don't have to wonder if I'm supposed to look for the green box or the black box. Just pick one!		About 10% of the toners I order have a defect. I use Amazon Prime to return these toners immediately. Another 10% do not have the advertised page count. One of the 27k toners I ordered only gave me 13k pages. We use a consistent printing system with nearly identical pages. There is no variability in our system to account for this kind of discrepancy.
1,The Motex pricing labeler gun comes loaded and when it is working, it is great. trouble is it doesn't work very well. It jams up a lot and the labels do not print. It also cuts off the labels inside the gun and it is 95% impossible to reload it. I have tried many, many times and still have NOT been able to reload the labels into the gun. There is only a diagram which is not real easy to follow. There should have been some loading instructions (words) to maybe aid in loading the gun. I would not recommend this item as it does not work properly and is extremely (and I mean extremely) difficult to load, IF you can load it at all. What a disappointment!
1,Purchased my first IP7220 from Amazon on 25 Feb 2014. The paper feed ceased functioning on 20 Dec 2015. Purchased same product on 24 Dec 2015. I opened the box yesterday, 2/9/2016, and this new printer also will not feed the paper. I still have a Canon all-in-one MP830 purchase in 2008, built like a tank, that is still going strong.  I've found that bottom feed printers cannot compete in longevity with the old top feeders. I've had poor luck with Epson printers in the past, so have been a long Canon fan. Any one have suggestions on who sells a quality printer. Canon no longer does, unless you want to pay $500 or more.
1,These pens don't work. I tried EVERYTHING.  I tried scribbling (you can vaguely make out the scribbles under the pens in the photo on the right), shaking them hard, scraping at the nibs, EVERYTHING. What is going ON at Paper Mate ?	If you don't like someone who is a workaholic and loves office products, send them these. Yuk!
1,I bought this toner in a 'package' deal with my fax...problem is that I was ripped off by over $8.00 shipping that was separate from the free shipping I got for my fax.  I'm not happy about this and I recommend NOT buying the toner and fax together...they'll rip you off with the shipping cost...over $8.00 to ship a toner that weighs a few ounces, Amazon should be ashamed and not let this happen!
1,Easy Peel means the pages will come apart in your printer, which just happened to me. So I'm out $150 for a printer. Horrible.
1,I really loved this pen when I received it as a gift. Though heavy, it writes like a dream. And really nice design.		The catch is that although it is made of durable materials, after about 2.5 years, the decorative cap on the bottom just fell off (not dropped or traumatized) and the cap seal has already worn out--it now fits loosely and the nib dries out. Parker is willing to repair it, but at more than half the cost of purchasing a new one. And in this age of the Interweb, they expect me to maintain the warranty information, and take no accountability for keeping records themselves. Not an acceptable level of service for a luxury product in the 21st century. Perhaps they could take a customer service lesson from Tumi.		For a $400 plus pen (my wife bought it at a retail shop), I expect durable, quality craftsmanship. That pen was lightly used, but had two manufacturing failures in less than three years. I also expect excellent customer service. I did not get it in this pen.		Parker has historically made fine high-end pens, but I guess no longer. And though I own several others bought years ago, I guess I will no longer buy Parker pens or those made by other Newell-Rubbermaid subsidiaries--Rotring, Waterman.
1,If you like non-intuitive buttons, ugly fonts, and especially uneven, shoddy print, then this is the printer for you! If not, steer clear. Oh, and the print cartridge that came with the unit malfunctioned from the get-go: the tape never came out, just jammed in the cartridge. The only reason I saw the crappy printing was because I ordered extra cartridges, which are also going back. Ugh. What a waste of time -- but thankfully Amazon is refunding the purchase. I'm going back to Dymo.
1,Using on a 2012 MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop PC.		If you move the computer at all--and I am using an external keyboard, but bumps and someone sitting next to you and moving the PC to one side or the other on the desk--and you have to reset these little legs every time.  Even a fraction of a move, and they will need to be readjusted.  I would not even consider using the keyboard on the laptop with these in place: the computer will slowly shift and these will need attention.  Not good.		They block the USB and other ports on your Macbook.  See even the photos on Amazon to get a feel for this.		They DO NOT raise your computer appreciably, so if you are buying this to get your computer at ergonomic eye level, forget it.  Why?  The photos show a "high position", but to get this, the device must be moved very far forward on your computer (underneath the keyboard).  Besides being in your way if you tend to rest on the handrest area of your laptop, there is no stability in the back of your computer.  One bump, and the entire thing will topple back.  I tested it as far forward as I would feel comfortable using it, and then measured the height off the desk in the back of the computer: 1.5 inches.		Better alternative: get a book and put it underneath the back of your laptop.  There will still be good airflow, it's free, you needn't carry it around if you are studying or writing in a library, and it's out of your way.  David Foster Wallace's "The Pale King" lifts the laptop as much as this device; if you want even more tilt, try "Infinite Jest".		I gave it two stars only because it is lightweight, it is simple in design (which is good), it may help someone who only wants 1.5 inches of tilt and doesn;t mind the fuss factor, and its made in the USA.  I honestly wish they made a longer set so that the computer would sit up higher--then it might (might) be worth the fussiness and price.		Addendum:  I found a way ti use these to get the computer up about 2.25 inches in the back.  By putting them straight up and down, with the small rubber foot against my computer screen glass and the computer bottom resting against the S curve in the device, and the bottom larger rubberized foot on the desk.  It is pretty much completely vertical this way, and frankly, less prone to moving.  It's more stable.  Yes, some would say there's pressure against the screen glass, but it's minimal; I have tested it with my hand and I can easily move the rubber "foot" off the glass, and I'm using an external keyboard so not putting pressure at all on the computer.  I was going to return these buggers, but now maybe, just maybe, I will put "Infinite Jest" back on the shelf and use these lifts.		I still wouldn't recommend them, however, as I am using them with an "off the box" method and they should work better as intended.  Back to the drawing board for the manufacturer.
1,The Neat company will screw you over. I have both the mobile one (like this) and desktop. I hadn't used the portable one for awhile, plugged it in, only to find out the company changed the software and no longer offers the software needed to use this machine!!  What a joke!!  You know they'll do it again in a few years and you'll be stuck paying to recycle it.
1,Worthless magnet. It won't even stick because the magnet is so weak. Don't waste your money.  I had read reviews that said the magnet didn't work. Let the buyer beware.
1,All 10 boards were bowed when they arrived.  I decided to use them as is because my time was limited and the photos I was hanging on them did not stay on well.
1,Not happy with design of pens, barrel is uncomfortable when writing long periods and majority of pens skip when writing
1,What I received was not 110. I have 110 and 90 in this same color by this same brand brought from a brick and mortar store. This pack, despite having a label affixed that says 110, is clearly thinner then the 110 canary Neenah I have and feels identical to the 90. Maybe incorrectly labeled, but leaves me disappointed as I do not need more 90 but am almost out of 110.
1,I purchased this specifically to convert 8 mm and Super 8 mm film reels I found in my grandparents attic.  What I found was this:		The entire image cannot be captured in the window.  It does not hold the full image from the film.  So if you don't get each frame (there are 20 frames per second) exactly like the others, the output will be jumpy.		There is NOTHING to hold the reel of film while you are working.  Are you just supposed to let the film nest on the floor?  It would be greatly improved if the company offered something that could hold the reels of film, takeup and feed, while working.  It makes it very difficult to use.		For slides and such, it may work well, but that is not what I purchased it for.
1,I was really excited to get these as they are fun and a unique design.  I was disappointed that I received 3 of all the same design.  I wanted three different designs as stated I would receive so that people could tell them apart.  However, I only received 3 Art Deco Designs.  I feel that it was misleading to say I would get three designs and only received one. I like the patterns and the board itself is of decent quality.
1,I purchased this shredder and it immediately jammed after I used it. I am not sure why people are giving it more that one star rating. I do not recommend buying this shredder, save your money.
1,was broken when arrived an unable to obtain replacement. Just disappointed as it went with my other bamboo desk accessories.
1,I received it a few days ago. Today, I already returned the product (Thanks Amazon for your easy return process).		I may have been just unlucky and received a defect product. I understand others may not have the same problem.	If so, I should be very few people to talk about this noise problem. If it is rather an inherit problem of the product, then number of similar reports should provide sufficient warning to AMAZON shoppers as well as UNIDEN quality control So, I'm giving my ONE star rating here.		The problem was this horrendously loud crackling noise.	Every time you picked up the handset, this loud crackling noise started right away, then it turns down a little and gets a little less after several seconds but still kept crackling on your ear. It was so bad that I didn't even test-call anyone. That's it. I tried it several times. The problem was stable and persistent. That's it. I re-packaged it and now UPS has picked it up already.		I thought of bad line connection but this phone has "permanently soldered phone line" connected directly to the handset. So trying another phone line was not an option. If you plan to use it on a very long phone line, the only way is to connect it to the original "permanent" phone line using the female connector.		Another minor note, the base cradle is just an individual piece of plastic which is NOT truly connected to anything, not to the wall, not to the handset. Yes, the phone line "can" be run and hidden on the underside of this cradle but it can be totally separated from the base, too. The base is rather light and I was not sure if it had enough weight to be stable. However, I didn't get to test it so, it is not a confirmed problem.		No, I do NOT recommend this product to my friends.		Thanks.
1,They don't pop up like pictured and 1 of the 2 I purchased didn't come with an envelope. Other one that had envelope didn't have glue to close envelope. Disappointing.
1,Like another reviewer had experienced, I did not receive full cartridges. I got about five good pages and then the ink dried up. On both sets. When I checked my ink levels, the cartridges were almost empty.		Total waste of money.		I DO NOT recommend.
1,I cant speak to how it works because it didnt.  Right out of the box, it had chips & nicks on the top where the motor is.  Then, not one single sheet would feed through even though I followed directions & set the slot to the correct angle.  Tried again & again - sent it back.  It was NOT supposed to be a refurb unit but it looked it with all the scrapes & nicks.  So disappointed!
1,They used the wrong product image...I should've listened to the other complaints of it being the wrong size. It is about half the size of the one shown in the pic...
1,The pen writes great! Its so good, but the cap after a while does not stay on and the ink leaks out, ruins your stuff, and completely dries out! I thought I had found my new love, but nope.... will keep looking.
1,I loved this printer until one of the color inks ran empty. Then it refused to print until I replaced the low cartridge. It would not even print black text in grayscale, which does not use any the color cartridges.		So, out I went to buy a new cyan cartridge. It turns out that I had to buy a whole set of cartridges, at over $80. I couldn't buy just the one I needed. I had visions of myself spending $80 every time just one color emptied, as I collected a whole shelf full of colors I didn't need. I couldn't believe it, so checked other stores, and they were all the same. So, this extorniate piece of crap goes in the dumpster, and I will never, ever, buy a printer without checking on the ink situation. And I will never, ever buy another Canon printer because of this.
1,Piece of s***.  Cut off for no reason.  WANT a refund or better I item.  That's watch out no good.
1,AT&T should have the most experience in understanding the needs of its billions of customers.  Yet this simple answering machine is not intuitive to use.  The design of the buttons leaves much to be desired. It loses its memory of date/time in a transient power loss, a very common event in this part of the country. My old AT &T unit had back up batteries.  I do not understand why this model does not have provision for back up batteries.		I know this unit was manufactured outside the U.S.  I am curious as to where the unit was engineered?  In the U.S. or in China.  If I have to guess, I believe it must be the latter, by someone who has never used a phone in his/her life.
1,Although it is comfortable on wrists, it does not stay in place at all.  I was constantly re adjusting it because is slides around.  Finally I just threw it in a drawer.  It seems to work better in there.
1,OK ruler but labels refuse to come off so see through is lost.  Bleck!
1,The lines were poorly set up and the book too small for my needs. The dates were already past when I got it making it useful for
1,This printer has never worked right. It's an absolute piece of junk. I will never buy an epson again because of this experience!!! Also, it guzzles ink!
1,Neither one of these worked well. The tape gets twisted inside the case. Threw them both away. :(
1,I would NEVER recommend this to anyone, 1 wheeel wouldn't stay on, very flimsy, picture is deceiving looks like you can put laundry bottles on all 3 shelves but they only fit on top making the bottom 2 almost usless, and when you did have bottles on top w/ the wheel that didn't work you couldn't even pull it in and out between washer and dryer, took apart and promptly shipped back
1,The pen itself appears to be well constructed and of good quality. The opening and closing operation are very smooth, and I do not get the sense that the pen was cheaply made as is suggested in some of the other reviews. The weight, feel, and grip are all great, and it looks great. However, it fails serve its primary purpose: it does not write! I have had it only a few days, and at first it was great. After signing a few documents it began to skip, and now it is hardly writing at all. In a way, it almost feels wrong to give the pen a bad review based on its bad ink refill, but as it is the original (and included) ink tube, I can't justify a higher star rating.		I'm going to have to buy a new refill and hope that fixes the problem.
1,Colors are good & lot are neon.  However,  several of the tops are hard to remove & could not get them off.  a few pens did not work or only worked for a few strokes & then stopped.  Yes Ultra fine tips but not all colors were use able.
1,Ordered on August 10, 2014. Dead on February 19, 2015. About half a year using it maybe once or twice a month for 5 minutes each.		The purple light does not work, but the white does. I turned it on and the light smoked a little then faded off.		(UPDATE from 08/04/2015)	Well, recently I tried to use the replacement that they sent me and it died again. I'm not even using this thing for 10 minutes at a time. But once again, the purple/UV light detector just fizzled out when I started it up. I don't get it... just didn't last. 2 lemons in a row?
1,This printer is mediocre. I'm not sure how this printer received such high reviews. I guess a lot of people had better experiences with this printer than I did. I use it only for printing text or scanning now. The good thing about this printer is that It's really easy to use the scan feature and to navigate the control panel, but that's about it.		Ever since I purchased this printer, I've encountered so many issues. The ink runs out fast and is expensive to replace for so little ink. I purchased aftermarket ink cartridges when other reviewers stated they had no issues with it and to save money, I decided to go for it. That was a big mistake on my part. When printing, it blurs everything and pretty much ruins everything that I printed. I went back to purchasing OEM ink and had to run the clean nozzle several times because it was leaving blank lines in between the text I was printing. That took up a lot of the ink. Then my macbook and dell laptop stopped connecting to the printer over wifi. It would say the printer cannot be found. I've tried all kinds of troubleshooting but still can't connect. In order for me to use the printer, I had to buy a usb cord which surprisingly didn't come with the printer. When printing photos, the quality is very poor. Don't waste your ink on printing photos. It's cheaper and you'll get better quality ordering online or at your local print shop.		For the price I paid for a personal all in one printer, I expected more. I'm so disappointed that I wasted money on this printer.
1,Lids are very loose and don't stay closed.
1,Can Avery make colored cards? Like on blue cardstock? For example
1,I was happy to get this compact stapler. Since it is by Swingline I hoped it would work well. WRONG!! The little slide button on the top did not work unless you are Hercules. After getting it ready to use, it is so noisy I could never use it in a meeting. Had to throw it away. Maybe mine was just defective. I appreciate the narrow design and think it's a great idea, but somebody please! redesign this thing so it will work.
1,This is entirely to small pen for writing comfortably.  Had ordered one once before that was just the correct comfortable writing size, but forgot to compare the size.
1,Let me address this by starting with the claims on the box.  Highly reflective...NO..it's more like a subtle sheen.  Shimmering pigment...yes, when they're dry.  Apply water to create interesting washes ... Not hardly..wet them and they become these weird chalky looking flat colors if you are working on black as is recommended on the box.	Now the even worse stuff....the colors are strange..green is more like turquoise..pink is kind of like alizarin crimson..red is a brick color..yellow is closer to sap green.  The metal colors are rather dull. In fact, all the colors are rather dull.	They are crumby,  apply pressure to these and they tend to crumble and leave little crumbs of color all over the place.		Bottom line.  You can get ordinary old metallic pencils a lot cheaper and in some really good brands.  Even bargain priced Crayola metallics are better. The water soluble properties of these are useless and not worth spending the money for.
1,This is a huge disappointment, and a total waste of money. They are so poorly made that, when I put in the papers, and tried to close the clasps...one of the "THIN" staples came loose and ruined the folder. not worth even a fraction of the price. Oxford used to be a good company. but they have went downhill fast.
1,Plastic cheap looking pens. I bought them along with the whole Kate Spade Desk Set. They are for show, cheaply made, and I doubt they will last if you actually used them. It feels as though I am the Hulk, with Loki...(breaks/crumbles easy) For $25.00 I expect at least for them to be Bic quality.
1,I really hate this machine.  I've had it for 6 months so I have had plenty of time to form an opinion.  We are a small business that scans around 50-100 pages a day.  This thing jams all the time and is unreliable.  I gave it two stars because it scans really fast when it works and it was relatively easy to connect over wifi to 6 different computers.  But I can't recommend it.  I use is sparingly at this point and have replaced it with a great machine from a brand that rhymes with blEpson.		Also - I replaced the separation pad twice and the indicator that says "Replace Separation Pad" won't turn off.  That sure is annoying.  I really really hate this machine.  My administrative assistant hates it even more than I do.
1,Purchased August 2014; Twice this machine has broken down in 2 years.  I tried to file a claim with Square Trade thinking I had purchased 2 years of extended warranty only to find out it runs along side the manufacturers warranty so basically a 2 year extended is only a 1 year extended warranty.  The Epson was a disappointment.  Ran great for fist 6 months and then experienced black lines down the middle of the paper, had to send it to the manufacturer. Now September 2016, the printer goes down again.  I had previously used HP and chose this based upon reviews and price.  Will go back to HP!	I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRINTER.
1,Didn't work no matter what I did and they were leaking when I got them. My shirt is ruined as it dropped on me and fingers stained ( but they at least washed washed off!).
1,Purchased in December 2016, started using it in March of 2017, and it broke for good (had several problems with it about a year after use) today. I now have to mail it in for warranty repairs -- yeah right. Don't buy it. It's crap.
1,This cushion is probably meant for more outdoor areas but definitely not an office chair. It puts you put of posture in conjunction with your chair. You'll constantly be adjusting the cushion or your butt and it wasn't particularly soft.
1,This product is not a mouse pad, but a mouse pad 'sticky'.  Once the adhesive back is removed, I guess you're supposed to leave it wherever you put it.  Don't waste your money on this!
1,Not impressive. ..color is weak.
1,seed it back it was not the item I seen on your order?
1,Easy to bend and break. Didn't last until Christmas. :(
1,Fast delivery,good price. Really bad product., Yellow toner all oiver everything, in and out of the printer.
1,One of the three rubber bands broke after less than 3 months of use.  Would not recommend.  It did look nice though.
1,The picture attached to this review is not the item I received.  When I ordered this refill, the picture was of a Fisher refill that looked like it would fit the regular Fisher Space Pen - what I received is the very skinny refill which does NOT fit the regular Fisher Space Pen models.
1,I have had several HP printers that have lasted years and years, hardly any issues but this one is another story!!!		This is the WORST HP Printer I have ever owned!!		Jams all the time - no matter what type of paper you put in it. Constant jams make it unuseable. I got it FREE from apple when I purchased my computer and now I know why. This printer is a pile of junk!!		I have noticed other HP printers that my friends own have also seem to have gone down hill so I think from now on I will shy away from HP in the future.		Also HP does not update their drivers hardly ever - unlike other conpanies. I guess since they became the number one computer co, in the word they let it go to their heads. Oh well.		Look elsewhere for a good printer. This one sucks.
1,Cheap plastic, but it worked a few times before one item broke.
1,I very clearly ordered a con50; it was a reorder actually because my first few orders were great. Ordered the con50 again, RECEIVED a con40. Not the same. Not what I ordered. Dont have time to deal with returns. Ill order converters from someone else, like Goulet maybe.
1,Let the buyer beware: Although Montblanc offered a lifetime warranty for years and one would think it would as a luxury brand, it no longer does so. It does not even honor the lifetime warranty of products purchased prior to the company's shift from a lifetime warranty to a limited two-year warranty, and the poor level of customer service--if it can be called that--hurts the brand of the company.
1,This product is hit or miss, which is weird considering it's supposed to be the same tape every time. Sometimes it's adhesive is pretty good, sometimes not and comes off the boxes by itself.
1,Do not use non scotch brand tape...due to the plastic housing, the dispenser is likely to break before the tape you'll try to be tearing from it.
1,Purchased on  October 10, 2017 on December 4, 2017 the phone would no longer make calls out, after about a 20 second wait I would receive a message that the number I was calling was no longer in service. This happened even when calling my own cell phone which absolutely in service. After contacting AT&T for service repair it was determined the problem is with this phone system. I am now using the old VTech system I luckily saved when I upgraded to this one. It works just fine even though the handset has obviously shows a lot of use.  I disposed of all the phones to that system except the main unit so will have to purchase another system.  This is totally unacceptable. Will see if I can get my money back through my creit card company.
1,Bought the 6 pack of white 08 pens to use over top of my water color. I was bummed that they didn't show up on my work. I also bought the three color of metallic and they worked great on top of the watercolor. Not sure why the white didn't.
1,phone was good for first year , but the battery died after a year. It seems that it should last longer. I emailed Uniden and they did not respond and there is no replacement battery on their website. So it was a waste of $22 since I need to buy a new phone again, and it will definitely NOT be a Uniden.
1,I have an all-in-one brother laser printer that is black and white and I love it, so when my 10 year old HP color laser printer gave up the ghost, I thought I would try this one.  Overall... it wasn't the best purchase.		PROS	1- Extremely easy setup.  I set it up to work off of my network print server, as well as wirelessly within about 5 minutes.  I was then able to install and setup 2 Mac computers and 3 PC computers within 20 minutes.  All worked fine and printed without issue to the printer.	2- Relatively quiet compared to my old HP.	3- Print speed	4- Price		CONS	1- Really, the only problem I found with it was the print quality when printing in color.  I was so disappointed.  Like I said, I switched from a 10 year-old HP color laser.  The colors on my HP were vibrant and true to what my photographs showed.  The colors on this printer's (Brother MFC-9840CDW) print-out were horribly washed out and almost made it look like the photographs were actually faded.		Although the price of the printer was excellent, I am going to return mine because of the color print quality.  If you don't care about that, this printer is great in every other way.  However, if you are looking for vibrant, true colors, like your photographs show... then I would go with a different printer.
1,I have always gone with the manufacturer's replacement cartridge and I will do so from now on. These less expensive imitations print fewer pages with poorer quality (even when following instructions on how to extend the cartridge capacity). I learned that I am willing to spend a little more money for a higher quality product. These are just not up to my standards.
1,My husband and I have both used Dr. Grip pens for years.  We like the thickness of the barrel and the good writing quality.  When I saw this version of a Dr. Grip pen, I wanted to use it.  It writes fine.  But, the thickness of the barrel just isn't there.  You have to grip the Dr. Grip pen tighter than either my husband or I want.  For people with hand issues, this isn't a good thing.  This deficiency makes this Dr. Grip pen seem like any other pen - and I can get many other pens with the same problem for a lesser price.
1,Absolutely a waste of money.  Maybe for a child size seat but not an average adult.  Made my issue with sciatic nerve damage worse rather than better.  How about no stars!!!!
1,Error light every single time we tried printing after less than 30 days of having it. The thing inside that grabs the paper stopped working, so we literally had to shove the paper in as it started to be able to print anything. Waste of money.
1,Ink runs out in 2 weeks. Tossed the printer. I'm done with Epson.
1,I have bought these several times trying to save a few dollars. The first batch yeilded about 1000 pages before the machine started beeping and flashing low toner. Both cartridges had the results, printing normal letters and office docs. I bought a second batch, taking a risk and getting 2 2packs... the same problem started with those. I tried a local Canon 128, and got about 2400 sheets... I put in one of the Linkyo cartridges after about 1100 sheets, beep beep beep... so I just started removing and replacing the same cartridge for about 1500 sheets... I was able to print approx 2500 sheets, but the last 1500 I was pulling and resetting the cartridge every 40-50 sheets. I went back to a canon 128 and got about 2300 sheets. I will stick with the canon branded units from now on.
1,Lousy. Read all the one star reviews.
1,I thought it would come with the color assortment shown on the picture. I received all the same colors. Very disappointing when you are a teacher doing table points!!
1,Pros:	Printing, scanning and copying works as expected. Can't expect this printer to produce laser quality printouts but it's acceptable. The air print feature works great for me. I have an iPad and an android phone and no problems. No problems setting it up; got the printer up and running within minutes.		Cons:	Very disappointed that the printer consumes a lot of ink. I can't afford to spend this much on ink. I don't print a lot but scanned quite a few documents. Maybe there's a software glitch that indicates low ink levels when it can keep printing more pages. I suspect that running diagnostics and printing alignment pages, cleaning printer head takes a heavy toll on the ink cartridges. Will see how it goes and update this review later. Tempted to use generic cartridge even though read some reviews that it doesn't work well. If you ask me, the printer should be free with ink purchase.
1,I brought one and it's so nice I ordered another .but butttt the first time I go to zip off the cover to wash. The zipper brakes off and tears the material. THEN I contact seller. NO ANSWER NO RESPONSE NOTHING. HAS BEEN OVER TWO MONTHS.AND STILL NOT A WORD FROM SELLER.
1,This mouse pad was purchased new but had a scratch with some kind of glue mark on it. I also purchased this one because I wanted one without a logo...This one of course has a logo..
1,I mean seriously, Royal.  You make a great product so why do insist on slapping a large permanently affixed label to the front of the collection basket?  I could understand a directions for use sticker but we're talking about an *advertising label* extolling the virtues of a machine I've already purchased!		Removing the label one shred at a time could be a life's work and at my age I don't know if I have enough time left to finish the task properly.		You want to put a label on the front of the machine?  Use a removable label, dillweeds!		Turns out common sense is remarkably uncommon.  Who knew?		In closing:		+4 stars for quality of the product	-2 stars for having to look at an advertising label for the foreseeable future.
1,Rather use regular highlighter
1,Papers feel cheap. I used note book from Staples, and it was better quality than this. I was actually looking better quality than Staples. It's getting harder and harder to find good quality products.
1,I looked long and hard for a wrist rest that I thought would be perfect  read all the reviews  and ended up with this one.  I have to say it does not sit flush with the keyboard, is not very squishy, but it does do what it is designed to and holds my wrists up. Just wish I'd gone with the squishier one.
1,packaging came unside down and a few of the markers were dried out.
1,I would have given this product 5 stars if it weren't for the very loud beeps it makes. I have to literally close my window every time I access my safe so that my neighbors don't potentially question it. What is the point of the beeps - to let others know you have a safe and in which room you store it?		If someone knows a way to disable the loud beeping noise this safe makes, I will gladly change my rating to 5 stars.
1,So far it has only been a problem.  It does not print WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get)  instead a jpg that appears okay on a Word doc prints out as a huge image and runs off the page.  I've wasted lot of ink trying to troubleshoot and correct  the problem.  It is a recognized problem on the HP page but the only solution is to uninstall and reinstall (and that didn't work.)	I am REALLY disappointed in this printer!	UPDATE - helpdesk instructions didn't work.  Things just got worse.  I gave up and returned it.  what an ordeal.
1,Doesn't work with my printer
1,Crap, crap, crap! This pen is utterly useless. You have to scribble just to get a faint marking out of it, which almost tears the highest quality quilting fabric. Just plain junk.
1,After spending what seemed an eternity trying to compare similar products (why, oh WHY can't we standardize the order in which dimensions are provided?  When something says 13x18x6, would it be so difficult to put a letter after each dimension, e.g., 13w x 18d x 6h? And for those who say there IS a standard...not so...I did some research and a number of websites gave differing 'standards')  Sorry...major gripe. Anyway, it wasn't easy to compare products, and out of frustration and an appreciation for the low price of this product (and the fact it was Amazon Prime with free shipping) I just went for it.  It arrived packed okay, wrapped in plastic and in a slightly larger cardboard box. But the flap that forms the closer latch on the lid was cracked, and about 3/4 split (as if it had been worked back and forth to the point of almost breaking off).  The six dividers fit into slots in the bottom of the box, and have tabs on the sides that clip into little slots at preset distances, so unless you leave some of the dividers out, there is no way to adjust the depth of the slots. Since I wanted this box for organizing my greeting cards (I like to buy them ahead when I find ones I like) the box isn't going to work for me. I have 10 times more birthday cards than, for example, anniversary or wedding cards, so I'd like to be able to adjust the space in each of the slots. If I were in a cranky mood, I'd send it back (because of the broken lid) but it was really cheap and I got what I paid for, so I'm just going to toss it and go to Michael's or someplace where I can shop by touch. On this item, just walk on by.
1,Nice looking and pretty sturdy considering it made of a cardboard material. The button clips come undone if you move it. It seems a little wider than the hanging folders.  I suppose for the price it works well.
1,Wish I could leave zero. Cartridge doesn't work yet two others from different vendors do function properly. Amazon wasn't sending a RMA so return shipping is on me so FORGET IT!!
1,I bought the tape to hold up a magnetic knife bar on ceramic tile, but every morning I would find the bar had fallen off the wall. I cleaned the surface, then used rubbing alcohol, let dry, and it still failed.
1,good
1,I have bought a number of mouse-pads similar in appearance and feel, but this one is different. It literally stinks.	Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who makes a fuss about plastic or chemical smells, generally.	This smell is aggressively nasty.		Different people have described it in different ways. I think is smells very much like mothballs. Out of a dozen pads, none with an unpleasant odor to speak of, this evil smelling thing comes along. What in the world is Belkin thinking? When I first opened the box, I found the pad in a clear plastic wrapper. As soon as I opened the wrapper the pungent smell of mothballs filled the room. It really IS that bad. What moron chose the rubber or adhesive formula responsible for this?		If the stink goes away fine, but if as some reviewers have stated--that the stink is here to stay--I will have to toss it out.	This is inexcusable. Amazon should discontinue carrying this pad. In effect, it is defective right out of the wrapper.		Seriously folks, I can't imagine another pad having this obnoxious stink. Do yourself a favor and keep looking.	Even now, two hours later I am mindful of a potent mothball smell filling the room. A rotten bad product. Belkin will never see my money again.		A quick update:  It's now the next day and I left the pad outdoors overnight to air it out. It's better now, I suppose I'll keep it. Maybe...
1,Feels very lightweight and plastic-ish.  In hindsite I wish I bought a better one.
1,The price on this box of file folders was excellent but the quality leaves much to be desired.  It's great if they're not handled much, i.e., stuck in a file cabinet and accessed occasionally.  Otherwise, they're flimsy and weak and it's necessary to tape or glue TWO files together for strength.
1,For want of a pennies worth of plastic, they make a tray that the paper falls out of when you are printing. Why on earth Canon would make a printer with so many features and then make it so the paper falls off the extended catcher when multiple pages are printed is beyond me. It prints fine but it is a pain the the ass to use.
1,Had to clean unit. It arrived with organic splatters on the glass top and meat-colored fragments of sticky stuff on the bottom feet pads. I also had to eliminate the old WiFi settings (Shame on you, owner of Wi-Fi named "TWOSUGARPACKS") which someone non-technical might find a bit scary (remove battery, reinsert battery, pound on the thing when the display says "TAP TO CHANGE...", have the FitBit software running and ready to configure a new scale). I'm not going to return because printing labels and dancing schedules with the delivery truck is a pain (I've sprayed the thing with disinfectant and given it a good scrub). Just... don't expect to get a shiny new unit. Apparently they have a lot of returns on these things.
1,Bankers Box makes great storage boxes and this appears to be a venture out into a new area.  Unfortunately, it appears that they need to stick with what they do best.		Normally, it takes a just a few seconds to assemble a Bankers Box.  They have great instructions and for those who are instruction impaired, just the set-up of the folded box is apparant.  But these boxes take a lot of work because the instructions are so inadequate.		Each box holds 56 standard sized ornaments.  So if you collect those Hallmark ornaments and are looking for a box to hold them, this is not it.  The seperators for the ornaments are very flimsy and it takes a lot of work just to assemble them as they keep falling apart because there is nothing holding the pieces together.  And to make it worse, this is a double decker box.  So to get a the ornaments in the bottom level, you have to remove the top level ornaments.  Since the only thing between the two levels is a piece of cardboard.		To make this work better BB needs to have the top level be able to pull out without removing the ornaments.		Good idea guys but bad execution.
1,Too small and cheap.
1,will never buy from again  These envelopes glue is dry  I have to use tape to seal  What a mistake
1,this stand was poorly made and did not hold my laptop. It was a major waste of my money and I didn't even respond to the seller as they wanted me to provide pictures of the packaging it arrived in ... wtf
1,The door gap at my house is 1.25" so maybe that's too close to 1.3" gap for it to work. What seems to be the problem with it not working in my house is that the Jamm Jumbo is smooth on the top. There's nothing to stop the door from sliding right across the top & open. The higher top sides don't stop the door. I noticed my 40 lb dog had no problem moving the door over the Jamm. I thought ,"Just how strong is my dog?" I tried it with my hand & it wasn't a problem to slide the door over the Jamm. I usually wouldn't take your time or mine writing about such a product but I remember in customer reviews seeing parents looking for a safe door stop. This isn't it. A toddler can push this open if the door/floor gap is 1.25". I can't say for smaller gaps. It's a carpet floor & the base doesn't move but the door certainly can move over the top of the Jamm Jumbo.
1,The good:  calls sound crystal clear, no issues with domestic calling.  Website is a bit sparse but functional.  Responsive customer support.		The bad:		1. International calls are spotty at best.  Calls to Ukraine, for example, will never go through no matter what.  Customer support told me that Ooma uses a cheap 3rd party international VOIP provider, which "sometimes works, sometimes doesn't."  In my case, it never worked.  Was told that an agreement was pending with a better provider to route international calls but no ETA was given.		2.  Bluetooth functionality is advertised as standard.  What you are NOT told is that a) the ooma telo accepts ONLY Ooma supplied USB bluetooth dongle and b) you must pay $10 a MONTH for this functionality (really, for Ooma premier but you cannot use bluetooth at home without subscribing to "Premier"!).  At a time when these dongles cost less than 10 dollars, I think this is a major rip off when a year later you will have paid $120 for the stupid dongle and a set of dubious features.  Seems kind of sleazy to force people to use Ooma supplied bluetooth adapter, when so many adapters are available.  You used to be able to use a generic bluetooth adapter but Ooma removed this functionality.  Not cool.  Imagine if after buying a car with hands free bluetooth calling you find out you must subscribe to "Ford Premier" to use bluetooth to connect to your car.  Silly stuff.		Otherwise works well, looks good on my desk, will keep it.
1,Didn't like it.  Not what I was looking for
1,I ordered two of these and only got one.	It feels pretty cheap and not always holds lead tight.	Its 4 point grab is not good enough.		Milled grip is too far away from the tip.	It looked nicer in picture than in reality.
1,Purchased this ink as a cost saver but having to replace it does not save me any thing.  as the cost for Kodak ink is inexpensive to begin with, I will stick with OEM products.
1,I've purchased this model pen with the standard plastic barrel in a black three-pack from an office supplies store, and couldn't be happier with that purchase. However, this pen has quality problems. The grip portion of this pen slides toward the tip - I'm guessing it happens when removing the cap - and then interferes with re-capping. To fix it, I need to push the grip back toward the top of the pen, while twisting and wiggling it to get it to move. I expected a premium experience of the Sharpie pen with grip, but this is not it.		Generally, I love this grip model of Sharpie pen - it's my replacement for the Paper Mate Flair that was ruined by redesign. But I'm concerned about the quality problems. See my Amazon review of Sharpie Grip Stick Fine Point Pen, 3 Colored Ink Pens (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJNK4TQLQTNC/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_asr_Td77G.0DZKP19) for quality problems with that set.
1,I would have given this 3 or 4 stars but because of the quality and aggrevation it caused me I simply couldn't.  The black glass and design are all very nice.  My unit had an important support bar which wasn't threaded so I had to tap and dye it. :(		Also the keyboard pull out piece is not functional...jammed after 1 day. This is an honest and genuine review for which I did NOT receive any discounts.
1,I thought this would be a good replacement for the name brand cartridge, but the images just print out like a 3D image, blurry. I tried reinstalling the print cartridges and various troubleshooting methods, but the images do not print out sharply.
1,Me: "I wondered if the sun rises in the East?"		Long delay.		Chat: "So, you has been having problems with your bread machine."		When I works, Quicken is useful. But there is no effective support when I fails -- usually after purported upgrades. I have come to believe that Chat representatives across all software and on-line merchants are hired to discourage customers from pursuing issues. For example: Today I launched a chat with Quicken, noting that the update link with Chase had failed amidst finger pointing.		Unlinking the account using the Tools requires the program to link with Chase. Yes. Strange but true. The result: Each time I update accounts the program tries to correct the error, locking my Chase account and requiring a new password. The Chat rep mulled this for four minutes and then asked? "So you want to create an account with Chase?"
1,Too thin & flimsy. Tears easily.
1,These Were Leaking From The Sealed Packaging, They Made a Mess In The Shipping Box. I Am Returning Just as Received.
1,I only gave two stars, because the pencils are not as smooth as what I like. They seem to be well made and in a nice tin to keep them organized. I just don't like the feel of them when putting a mark to paper. I've only tried the a B pencil, but it was not as dark as my Kimberly B pencil, another minus for them with me.
1,Red toner cartridge started leaking toner almost immediately, causing red speckles.  I managed to get a bit of life out of it by cleaning the printer transport every week. Black cartridge caused a black line on the left side of the page. Consequently both had a very short life due to wasted toner.
1,Dud. Got it after reading great reviews but the printer paper continually fed crooked, for copies and printouts, and the ink often smeared near the edge. Brother customer service was never able to fix the problems so I just returned it.
1,I'm using it, but it constantly squeaks!  On arrival, it looked older than the one I took out!  I've got my old drum in the box just in case.
1,would not work in my HP 2610 photosmart printer. This printer REJECTS any cartridge that isn't an original, ----- but I love the printer.
1,I figured this would be good alternative to the more expensive model, since I'm only going to be using it once in a while. It does fundamentally work, but basically:		CONS	1) The construction is kind of flimsy - the tops keep popping off of it, and the bottom tray came off a couple of times. It's not hard to replace these things, but just very annoying that it keeps happening.	2) you can't punch holes in more than maybe a couple of sheets of paper at a time		PROS	1) It does punch holes if you don't mind the above.		If you're committed to the Circa system, I think splurging on the more expensive model is worth it - I wish I had!
1,It doesn't fit on a door. WTH?
1,I purchased 3 of  these inks for my HP 8610 printer.  I did not need to use them before now since I had  one already in use, however now that I need to replace the cartridge I am getting a message saying that these inks are incompatible.  I tried another of the batch and the same message.		I cannot understand why this has happened since the information on Amazon and the box indicates that the ink is for the printer.  I ordered from amazon previously same inks and they worked.  They were sold directly by Amazon so I will try to contact them to see if they will replace them.
1,Signs didn't stay affixed to posts.  We used the stick-on things they provided, even tried using staples and extra tape.  They just kept falling off.  We couldn't keep them on for even 1 day.  Everything else, the signs themselves and the stickers were decent quality.  It's just the signs sticking to the posts that were the issue.  Unfortunately that's the only reason I bought these.
1,I thought this planner had all 7 days spread out but it is only singles dates.
1,This is probably fine for a normal alert person, but for the elderly that have vision problems and are sometimes confused and upset when they need to summon help, it is poorly designed. The place to push to sound the alert is hard for my mother to find and hard for her to push. It's only on one side and she needs to push the center.  She can not always tell which side to push or where on the correct side to push -- especially when she's upset and needs help!  It should have actual, large buttons that're reliable, well defined by touch, and easy to push, one on each side -- not a snap membrane that requires a firm push in the very center -- difficult for someone with weak hands.
1,After that, it started stopping printing, and giving me a message "unable to Print 32" and then asking me to clear a paper jam. I followed all their instructions to find and remove a paper jam, and could not find even a tiny piece of paper anywhere in the machine. So I unplugged it, and then plugged it back in, and it stopped giving me that Error. But,as soon as I would send a doument to it to print, it would always kick out 2 blank sheets of paper, and then tell me the same error oode. I must have looked 10 to 15 times for any tiny scrap of paper stuck in the machine, and never found any. The brother website for their help instructions, just told me to do exactly what I was doing, and were not very helpful in solving my problem. So, my only option was to return it to Amazon, and as usual the customer Service at Amazon was fantastic, and immediately gave me the forms to send it back. It's gone now, and I'll have to get a new printer, but Brother is not what I'll be looking for!!!
1,Im giving this 2 stars bc the plastic bit in the middle that has the threading is cheap, and after unscrewing it once it started to damage the threading. This plastic piece is also the part that you have to twist to change the lead hardness indicator. I used sewing get machine oil in the top and middle part of the threading. This helped. This pencil has some cool tricks, however, in the way that the delicate tube tip retracts into the pencil for protection. Its a great weight! Feels good to write with and the clip is awesome. The design just needs a little more work. Boy, Im glad I didn't buy the same one from Office Max for $20+! I was tempted to get one in each size, bc I tend to want collection. I opted for the .4 which is harder to find. I might get .3 too, but doubtful I will go for all of them now, since it is not as impeccable as I had expected.
1,for the hand held stapler. excellent.
1,Very Disappointed.  Battery compartment was very difficult to open as well as close.  Batteries were difficult to insert the 1st time, but after that it got easier the more times I inserted them.  I inserted brand new batteries several different ways but the motor would noever run when pencil was inserted.....I had a Panasonic battery operated sharpener before this so I know how it is supposed to work.  This one didn't.  It was returned for a refund.  I wouldn't buy it again for 2 reasons:  1) the difficulty in opening and closing the battery compartment  2) the poor instructions on how to insert the batteries.  I tried them as pictured with alternating +  and - side up then the opposite, thinking the I was reading it wrong, but it didn't work either way.  In addition it was packaged very poorly in an Amazon box, but with no air bags or anything to keep the sharpener from banging around inside the Amazon box during shipping.
1,We were thrilled with the Epson XP-600 and the quality of the ink through the first two cartridges.  However, the third cartridge doesn't seem to allow any ink out.  I've run the printer's self-cleaning of the ink jets three times, and the re-alignment of the print head twice, and nothing seems to help.  Amazon won't let me return it because I bought it too far in advance.
1,Erasers all easily broke between he base of eraser and the triangular part.
1,Thought it would be real sketch paper it's like plain printer paper
1,read the review guys. the tip shakes like crazy. i bought a silver one too but the silver one shook much less but the tactility of the press was different. i geuss theres not much quality control for the price of these.
1,These were too big and did not hold my jeans down as promised, which is too bad since I was looking forward to utilizing these.
1,I purchased this phone to use with my Plantronics S11 amplified headset and no one could hear me the phone was not able to handle the amplified headset.  I purchased a different phone and everything worked fine
1,The printer design itself is great. Probably one of the best printers I've ever owned. The software is great, every functionally you could ever need in a printer.		The issue here is the replacement ink cost. A full set of regular ink cost about $60, and the XL ink costs about $100. Normally this would not be an issue, as you can get third party ink cartridges for $15 a set.		However, instead of letting users use third party ink as we like, Epson constantly updates their firmware to reject these cartridges on purpose. This isn't even the worst part. Epson constantly drains your ink into a waste ink tank, just so you have to buy more ink. Then when the waste ink tank is full, they lock the printer and tell you to buy a new one. If you want a printer with low ink cost, go Canon. They actually allow you to disable their ink cartridge checker so you can use whatever ink you want.
1,I purchased this Kingway cartridge set about a year ago for HP8500 A910.  I did not have the trouble that some have experienced.  However I doubt seriously that they really equal capacity to the HP XL cartridges.  They are all empty now except the cyan cartridge that I never opened.  Our printer use has not changed.  I recall much longer life with the HP cartridges.
1,It broke after three weeks of light use. It was really pretty and I would have enjoyed wearing it, but one day the cording broke and all of the beads fell off.
1,THESE ARE NOT TRUE EPSON CARTRIDGES!  DO NOT BUY. THIS IS A SCAM.
1,While these boxes are made from recycled materials, the construction is poor.  When assembling the bix from the flat position, rarely if ever are the edges of the bix aligned.  After taping the bix it is misshapen due to the inaccurate cutting of the cardboard.  Will not order again.
1,All was well until it stopped working with a generic error code. Worked for 6 months of light use, then nada. Too bad, we liked the printer but now it's a door stop.		Update: Tried Canon's diagnostic and repair methods, and it starting printing...horribly. Everything on the page is distorted, and that's when the page actually comes out. This thing is just a mess. I picked up a MB7520 on here for a lot cheaper and it blows the 7120 away in terms of speed and quality so far.  The 7120 was just dropped off at electronics recycling for demolition. Good riddance.
1,These printer cartridges are always expensive and they run out of ink quickly.  I would love to be able to get a different cartridge but this is the one my printer accepts.
1,These nearly ruined my new printer.  I will not buy again.
1,No es roja, es mas bien guinda o un rojo muy obscuro, no me agrado el color ni la textura, comparada con la black bullet proof de Noodlers.
1,This is not the sturdiest of ID/Badge holders. The "strong nylon cord" frays quite easily and breaks fairly quickly.  Tried two of them attached to a simple plastic ID card and within about 8-9 days, they both broke.  The cord is very thin, much more so than ones I've used previously. The metal clip seems okay, but I would not feel comfortable leaving my ID or something on this thing.
1,sorry this did not work out does not fit our couch
1,The ink cartridges turned out to be demo-type cartridges. Thus very little ink in them. A waste of money.
1,Let's get the dislikes out of the way.  This doesn't have an AC plug, it has a USB cable.  You're only choice is to plug it into your computer or other USB chargeable port you may have.  Show of hands; how many of you have a wall outlet with a USB port?  Probably a handful of you.  So out of the gate this is not very handy at a home setting.  Might be tough in the office too if your USB ports aren't up high.  The organizer does come with rubber charger cord holders for the male end of your cord. You may need to go through all of them to find out which one suits your particular charging cord best.  While I did find the ones that fit, I could not rest my tablet or phone in a standing position due to their cases.  Finally, it may be a great organizer for your office supplies and devices to have them all in one place, but it does not help you organize all of those cords.  The USB's are in the front.  There is no place to tuck the cords away.  They hang all over the sides.		As for the positives; it lools sleek, you can keep your most important items together in one spot, and the organizer itself takes up little real estate (now the cord on the other hand...)
1,I bought this telephone because it was one of the only ones available that had more than one line and was a wall-mountable digital answering system.  I don't use it for a soho system.  I recently found out that, and I quote the AT&T technical team, "the phone can only do one thing at a time".  So, if you're on line 1 when a call comes into line 2, you're out of luck - the answering system will just ignore the call and it will ring forever.  What a piece of junk.  How can AT&T sell an answering system phone that doesn't answer?
1,This printer would be a good printer if there was good online support for installing the buggy software.  It gets stuck saying that it is 99% installed, then gives an error.  There is no place on the net where it helps to find out how to reset the computer.  Uninstalling software does not help. Only the printing and copying works for me, I am out of the most important part- the scanner.  HP needs to get their act together!
1,I bought these based on the sample pix, because I needed some new green shades.  The ones I received all are blue,purple & pink. No yellow or green to make different colors, they come out the same. Very dissappointed
1,it doesnt stay in place, keeps sliding down from the position, have to keep adjusting the band
1,A big old mess. I wasted at least 1 of these in a great bumbling pile of flaking white out. You'd think we wouldn't even need white-out anymore with these new computer things but still I always need it for something. Call me old fashioned but I'm going liquid every time. Nice coverage and whiteness though.
1,These work good for artists and paper but just run off on anything else.
1,Yesterday I hauled this printer to the basement, repacked it and put it on a shelf for storage - the garbage would probably have been a more appropriate place.		This is without a doubt the noisiest printer I have ever owned or used. It start feeding the paper with a 'clunk' and the actual printing is a loud buzz, almost like an old dot matrix type printer. During printing it jiggles back and forth and I could actually feel the vibrations if I had my hand on top of my desk. When done it spits the paper out almost to the end of the paper catch tray.		The Dura-Brite ink is sharp and durable, it won't spot or run if you happen to get a drop of liquid on the print, but the  ink cartridges do not seem to last very long and are rather expensive.		After about a year of use I had my first big problem, the black ink wouldn't print. I went through the head cleaning process a couple of times trying to fix it, boy does that ever suck-out the ink, but it didn't help. I called Epson and they would have been happy to analyze the problem, if I wanted to pay them. The tech rep did give me a hint at no cost though - remove the cartridge and turn off the printer for 24 hours. He told me if the printer is left on it has a tendency to 'drown' and jam the heads. He recommended turning the printer on only when I was ready to print and leaving it off when not in actual use. Isn't that convenient - I would have to wait for the printer to go through the the charging cycle whenever I wanted to print something. I did this for a while but got tired of going through this hassel and began leaving it on. Oooppps!		The problem with the black ink began again recently. I put in a new cartridge and that did not help. Then the other three cartridges went out. I cleaned the heads and printed a test and a blank sheet of paper came out. Tried it again with same non-results.		Don't waste your money on this printer, it is frustrating, expensive and unreliable. I am not criticizing all Epson products, my first printer was an Epson C60 which worked fine and one of our printers in the office I work in is a C62 which has given us 2+ years of good performance. It is just this particular model that stinks.		STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS - AND BELIEVE ME THE COSTS WILL BE GREAT!
1,ok
1,Love this brand, however these prns don't like to write at certain angles and breaks the paper. Stick to the felt tip pens by this company. Also, description states. 4mm but its much thicker. More like medium ballpoint pen rather than a micro.
1,One day I'll learn to listen to my fellow product reviewers. These are the lowest quality thumb tacks I've ever seen. I wish I'd have paid attention to the warnings and bought from a better branded company. This product probably stays on the market because once a buyer is suckered into purchasing, they don't bother returning the worthless product. I've never seen a thumbtack that's too dull to stick into a wall. The ends are nowhere near as sharp as they should be or need to be. I had to use a hammer to get them into the wall. And, no matter how gently I tapped, most of the tops broke off. It was a mess. I'll never purchase from this company again and definitely not this brand no matter who sells it. I only give 1 star because you can't give Zero stars and I desperately wanted to alert my fellow Amazon.com shoppers.
1,It is the worst product to set up to use. Don't waste your money
1,Poor performance. The lines these pens make are horrible.
1,feathers are falling
1,They are cute but don't stick well.
1,Black cartridge exploded - What a mess!
1,I purchased this phone based upon several good reviews, but the sound quality makes it a loser. It is difficult to understand the person talking on the other end, and having purchased it from an online vendor I am stuck with it.  I will use it as a backup phone but it certainly cannot garner my regular phone status.
1,I bought this printer on a rocking deal from Best Buy for $15 total based on a combination of points, coupons and free shipping. It works ok, prints two sided, holds 500 sheets of paper in two x 250 page cassettes, prints photos well, the WIFI works OK and overall it's a decent machine. Yeah, it chews through ink but I buy the XL ink cartridges from LD on sale and it's not a big deal BUT this thing has a LOT of quirks that quickly overwhelm any positives.		The machine has one huge Achilles heel and a lot of smaller ones as well. It is a great example of omplete engineering stupidity brought to the real world. Apologies to the engineers who work for most companies, but the Canon engineers who built this machine are idiots for one simple but major flaw. Why do I say this? You CANNOT change an ink cartridge until the printer says you can. So if you have an ink cartridge that is defective, has dried out and looks like junk, the machine does not know the cartridge is really empty and you can't just change it without a rogue 10 step process from Google or printing 5 pages in solid color of the dead cartridge (magenta) even if they all come out green.		This printer goes offline constantly. To get it back online, turn it off, wait for it to shut down and then unplug the power cord for 60 seconds, plug the power cord back in and turn the power on. I have to use this procedure about once a week and it's always when I'm not sitting near the printer but somewhere else in the house so Ihave to walk upstairs and run the power off/power on cycle.		I needed a passport photo fast and the magenta cartridge was nearly empty but the printer thought it was OK. The pictures all came out green and no, I'm not a Martian. 45 minutes later after feeding 5 sheets of "red" background paper through the machine, it finally knew the magenta cartridge was empty. I replaced it, the machine did the "idiot cycle" for cleaning, adjusting and whatever and 15 minutes later it worked fine.		When a cartridge looks low, I want to be able to change it and forget about for when I need it. You can't do that with this machine, it has to WANT to let you change it. I guess for $15, I paid what this machine is really worth. Don't pay more.
1,This has a TERRIBLE smell that would not air out even after a week. I got my money back.
1,I returned it.  Cheaply made!
1,These are hollowed out on the bottom which makes them very weak. Stand on one and it'll squish like a pancake. Use it on a door that swings outside and the slightest wind will close the door, squishing this "door stop" along the way. It's also too short and won't work for that reason too. It's amazing that something as simple as a door stop could have this many things wrong with it.
1,These do not look very purple on paper. In the box they are beautiful
1,Horrible sound... I and my callers sound crackling and the volume is really low, even when set on max on both head set and phone.  Going back.
1,The cartridge will not work with the printer.  The printer keep tell me it don't recognized the cartridge, therefore I can't even get it to work.	I order a 3rd brand from another company and those unit work, but this one will not.
1,It's pretty terrible, I couldn't even print a single page because the paper wouldn't load correctly. And it's the first wireless printer I've had that I couldn't connect to my internet. So disappointing
1,I guess I just got a bad one.  It prints fine, when it works.  75% of the time the pad sticks at the top and I have to fiddle with it to pop it back down to printing position.
1,Poor quality, would not recommend or purchase again.	trish
1,Hard to get cards in and out of.
1,I wavered between giving this cart three stars (it's okay) and two (I don't like it).  I didn't send mine back, so I figured it was okay enough."But really, it's not. I have the Iris scrapbook cart and that is a well designed item. This is not. It's flimsy. The fact that the drawers are not flat is a problem for many items. They are a tad too shallow for a good many things that I was hoping to use this for (bottles of ink). If the drawers were the depth of the edges, the bottles would have fit, so it's quite frustrating.		Additionally, the drawers don't come out far enough and they fall open easily. The whole thing teeters. Why did I keep mine? Probably because it matches my others Iris cart and I was too lazy to send it back. I am not happy with the purchase but I bought an open box and paid less. But frankly, I wouldn't recommend this cart to anyone. Look elsewhere, or, if you want a cart for 12"x 12 paper and don't mind pulling out the entire closed drawer to access them, get the Iris scrapbooking cart.		That said, I've got a hundreds of things that needs stowing and easy access and so I've kept mine. It's not useless. Not much of a review, that.
1,I have stopped using my Lexmark C543dn color laser printer because I cannot justify the high cost of toner replacement cartridges. Lexmark has a turn-in-your-old-cartridge program which makes it seem that the savings would justify using this program. Unfortunately the toner consumption is too high, even when considering the program savings.		What's more, I would even put up with these costs if the color print quality were absolutely perfect, good enough for a graphic designer needing client quality approval. It is not.		I would much rather pay a steep price for a color laser printer and get my toner dirt cheap.
1,Ordered a box of 40 Mead #10 security envelopes as pictured, received 30 cheap non-Mead envelopes with a rubber band around them. Not impressed.
1,I activated an OOMA device back when it was promised to be free for life. They deactivated my account without notice and now charging me a monthly fee to reactivate the same device.  Contract is a contract and must be honored. It is a scam, beware.
1,I tried this on a 350 page paperback with no luck. The pages flopped over despite my attempts to place it at various angles.	Tried again on a 200 page text--nope. Perhaps this would work well as a paper weight, but it's not up to the task of reading, at least if you plan to read anything over 20 pages.		Although the leather is quite lovely, my iPhone does a nicer job holding pages open.
1,The black pen was very rough from the beginning and sometimes not working. I couldn't use it. The red one was not working anymore after 2 weeks. I used it only for underline. Blue is working smooth. I don't want to buy this color set again.
1,Read just great reviews and couldn't wait to receive this as I've been pleased with other Noodlers inks.		I cannot believe for a second that this "Heart of Darkness" is an authentic Noodlers product.	Nothing about this ink or pen is as described, the ink itself is lighter than my other brand inks and as far as being permanent, that is a joke as it can wash off easier than any other brand.		The pen that people have raved about is useless (which was really disappointing because I was so excited to see what people were raving about).		For these reasons I have to believe that this is NOT an authentic item & do not recommend you waste your money.
1,This has the potential to be a great product. The problem is that it doesn't write when it is tilted at the normal angle at which I hold a pen or pencil. I have to tilt it more upright to what is an unnatural position for me or none of the ink flows. This flaw turns what has the potential to be a breakthrough product into a mediocre one at best. I have attached a customer image showing the difference when writing at these different angles.		UPDATE: after further attempts to use this I've downgraded my rating to 2 stars. This product is simply not ready for prime time. I'm really surprised that the folks at Sharpie put their good name on this. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that there may be some people who normally hold their hand at the awkward angle required for this pencil to work well. When it is held at that angle the product itself does what it says.
1,This was far to stiff and flimsy at the same time.  The pad did not lock, so it was constantly moving around.  The "massage" surface was extremely uncomfortable.  I got it for under my desk at work and I am in the process of trying to get the packing slip to return.
1,Doesn't flow very well in my Pilot Metro or Lamy Safari, seems too runny/thin. In comparison, the Noodlers Black flows very well in both pens. Can't recommend it.
1,That a second binder from case-it first was three inch this one four, both are broken. First lasted three months, second about two... Zippers break
1,Despite the other reviews, these magazine files DO look like cheap cardboard and not plastic.	I bought them for my office, but they look too cheap to display. They would be great for inexpensive, out of sight storage.
1,This packaging tape is just average - it's not horrible, but it doesn't quite do the job. Very stiff, not sticky enough. Would not purchase again.
1,The first 3 of 5 that we've used have broken at the string. Disappointed.
1,not very permanent I used to attach rhinestones to shoes and they lasted 4 days in dry conditions? probably less if in wet conditions?
1,I use this sharpener in my classroom. I picked this one for the "quiet" factor, large shaving cup, and 3 year warranty.  It gets fairly light usage, considering it's advertised as "heavy duty."  The day after I bought it, I would sharpen some pencils and it would not stop running even when the pencil was removed.  The only way to shut it off is to unplug it.  After just a few days it would do this after only one pencil was sharpened.  Now it starts to turn on and off by itself.  This is obviously unacceptable in a classroom where every noise distracts students, not to mention freaking them out when it turns on by itself.  I e-mailed Bostitch to see if they had any suggestions on how to fix it, but never got a response.  It's a good sharpener, so I've kept it, but it's not really doing the job I need it to since I have to keep it unplugged when it's not in use.		I also bought it from TeacherDirect.com where it was about $30.
1,it was ok, nothing special, but was good leather
1,Very disappointed. We just had to order the original since these are printing ups shipping labels terribly with lines and dots all over them. I am printing on label paper, but have never had an issue with canon. I did print a couple test labels on regular paper with mixed results, marginally better, but I just hope this thing didn't ruin my favorite printer.
1,The brushed steel and 'jewels' at each end make this a very nice looking pen. Inside, the grip is a glossy black plastic. Unfortunately, the pen just doesn't write very well. Even a slight pause in writing means it's going to skip at first. The tip is relatively soft, and certainly not putting down a fine line. The included ink reservoir has a pump mechanism for filling. Dipping the pen into a bottle of Quink with one hand and pumping with the other is clumsy. I have yet to fill it without getting ink on me. The amount of space the pump part uses reduces the ink capacity by half or more. The valve inside is a steel ball, and it rolls down and clicks as you tip the pen down to write. I finally chucked that part and replaced it with the standard ink cartridge.
1,they don't fit my wallet then when you cut it down they break apart
1,I was looking forward to being able to use this in my classroom.  The phone is on the other side of the room from my desk and it is inconvenient when I have to make calls to parents.  I wanted to use this for a pen, pencil, and a pad of Post It notes.	It was quite easy to apply to the wall by the phone.  It just does not hold objects well.  It did not hold a pen at all (for more than five seconds).  It did hold a 4" pencil but not a full size one.  It did not hold a pad of Post Its but it did hold when I only tried to hold four Post Its at a time.  If you want to keep picking up the items you try to stick to it, then maybe this is for you.  This product is just not ready for store shelves yet.  The pic actually shows it holding a flash drive--maybe flat on a desk but not vertically on a wall so this is very misleading.	One reviewer mentioned a second pad but this only comes with one pad.  It is ridiculous that they call this a "Stick All" pad.	They also recommend waiting one hour before trying to stick anything to the pad--I did follow these directions.  Not sure why waiting would make any difference but I did wait.
1,The amount of space on the writing tab is only 1/2 inch in the vertical position.  Forces you to write small.  Not helpful for easy locating of names and subjects in a filing box and tired eyes,  Poor design- the front cover should be a 1/2 inch lower for more writing room on the tab.
1,Do yourself and get a converter. If you're using a fountain pen there is no good reason for you to buy cartridges.
1,This is the second package of these that I have purchased and it will definitely be the last! I thought the first pack I bought was just defective so I got a second one, thinking I'd yield better results, but the same exact thing happened on all four of the dispensers. You are supposed to be able to press the tape dispenser down lightly at the beginning of the mistake and slide it across the paper until you reach the end of the mistake without waiting for it to dry like you have to do with Liquid Wite Out. Sometimes the correction tape works effectively, but more often than not, the tape comes off the reel inside or gets tangled inside and shreds the Wite Out off of the clear strip reel its on and CAN'T be fixed. So you end up throwing it away after a few uses and wasting more than half of it!		Also, you end up having to run your finger over the corrected area to get it to adhere to the paper and a lot of times when you write over it, the pen point scrapes some of the Wite Out and it comes off the paper!		Be warned of the cheap quality and also the fact that Bic doesn't stand behind their product because I called to tell them about the problems with these correction tapes and they said that I could pay the cost of shipping it to them but they would NOT replace the product for me. What's the point then?  I will never buy these again. You are better off just buying the Liquid Wite Out, which is what I'm going to do.
1,Item received was NOT like picture, in construction nor materials used! Item received was felt lined pieces of fiber board.		Very dissatisfied in amazon utilizing this vendor.
1,I'm sorry. I had high hopes for this. Turns out my slides were out of focus and the colors mottled. I tried 30 different slides many with different mounts in every configuration possible but nothing proved satisfactory. If you think they are going to look like what is projected on your slide projector screen you will be wrong. I am really good at using hardware like this. Fourty years of electro/mechanical technical experience in imaging related industries has taught me that nothing "works like magic" or very well on full auto. All of these inexpensive photo devices need to have manual focus controls, easy to use interfaces and operator manuals that are clearly written for the man on the street. This should not be sold without an SD chip in the box. I now have a 32GB SD chip I don't need but will not return it in all fairness to Amazon. I don't like returning purchases. It was my decision to purchase based on the reviews and Q/A. I did however return this scanner and will seek something with fewer dubious claims. To review, focus control might have saved this from rejection but the price was too high to accommodate keeping it. Find something else for your slide project....like a slide duplicating service for instance? You get what you pay for still applies these days.
1,The name should be a tip off that these are complicated. No one that I showed these to was able to figure out how to use/reuse them. It's a good idea that falls short on application. I wouldn't use these in my business as I feel it would be a poor reflection on my judgement in the eyes of my customers.
1,It takes a lot of effort to use it even for 2 pages, and it's using 2 standard-sized staples (Swingline 210 per strip) per time I use it.  There isn't any way to adjust it to use 1 staple instead of 2.  Now I will go through my staples twice as fast using twice as much effort as my old stapler, and I hate waste.  If I had known the amount of effort it would take to staple 2 pages with this stapler and had I known it takes twice as many staples to staple a page, I would have passed on this stapler.  On the positive side, it does staple a lot of pages.  Unfortunately, the majority of my stapling is 5 pages or less, so it's still a waste.
1,I purchased this handset as well as a base set in 2009.  Overtime the batteries seemed to start losing their connection.  You had to unplug and then replug in the battery.  Then static started on a couple of the phones.  Now one of the phones will not even work.  Now if you press the speakerphone button on a handset the whole handdset turns off.  The phones worked well for about 1 to 2 years, and then the problems started.  Now, out of the 5 handsets we have only two work reliably.		We were very disappointed given the reviews we read on Amazon.  I would not recommend.
1,Best dedicated printer I've ever owned.  Have a CP900 and before had one that got fried in a thunderstorm, now with a new PC running Windows 8.1 I find out Canon is not supporting beyond Win 7!  Don't buy this unless you are a Win 7 or XP kinda guy or gal!
1,Ordered because they can be erased just like the AWESOME other Frixion pens I've been using for a long time.  Yes, they erase but....SMUDGES BADLY!  I tried these on every type of paper and ink I could find...very disappointed.
1,The original inks that came with it feathered on most paper, and it shipped a few weeks later than expected. On good paper, the former should not be an issue.
1,Terrible, wrong size so the set I bought for my class were too large for the binders and they wouldn't fit on the shelf well. The zipper tabs zip right off the end very easily. Super frustrating waste of money.
1,These pencils (12) arrived unsharpened, and the points on several continue to break.  Would not recommend.
1,I bought this about a year ago. First, the light broke; then the cup holder fell out and the annoying little Styrofoam beads used for padding were a pain to clean up; then the material tore and I was gathering beads again. Why aren't they in a separate container like a plastic bag? I assume its because a plastic bag costs money, the vendor wants maximum profit, and figures by the time it falls apart, it's out of warrantee. On the other hand, I've purchased 4 of these desks in 5 years sold by various vendors and they are all the same. They are all made at the same factories in China. In fact, this exact table is sold by TG at double the price; even the photo is identical. Therefore, I've resigned myself to buying one a year and I'll just choose the cheapest. Here's a tip: use plastic tape to secure the pencil holder and cup holder to the desk to reduce the risk of beads up the dog's nose or in the kid's ears. (They really are nasty.)
1,We ordered this scanner as a replacement to a dependable HP scanner we've had for ten years.  Sadly, Canon isn't standing behind it and has even removed this same critical review from their website for this product, leaving us with serious concerns regarding their practices.		The premise of the device is good: fast scanning and good quality.  It DOES deliver on that promise; however, the software is very buggy and doesn't work properly, causing the unit to become more of a burden than a saving grace in only a week.		The software requires a local administrator account to install, which is the only piece of hardware we've seen in the last two decades to have such a requirement.  That means that even if you are a domain administrator with all rights, you can't install it on the domain.  You have to log off and log into the computer locally as 'administrator' for the software to install.  Why the software is blocked for domain installs is beyond us.		Once installed, it worked well for about a week, though we would often have to press the buttons multiple times in order to get a response from the scanner.  Then, without warning, the software wouldn't open anymore.  The idSCAN program somehow developed a compatibility issue and wouldn't open.  Re-installation did nothing to solve the problem and only made it worse.  On the second install, the idSCAN utility, which is needed in order to run the entire scan suite, would not install.  We ran into the problem on multiple computers, with some even being a fresh install.  We managed to find a way to force the installation to go through using the command line, but we shouldn't have to go through all that rigmarole just to install the basic software needed to operate the scanner.
1,Too big.  My mistake.  It has a lot of room to make entries and is nice looking but just a tad too big
1,the color isn't the smooth grey pictured. all the folders in the package came with a distracting oil stain all over them, as if its their natural texture. vey dissappointed, but using them.
1,I was not going to write a review, but Valuetoner insisted. The price is reasonable. The cartridges initially work, but some cause problems  later on. It took a while to discover this. It is very difficult to determine which cartridge is at fault; so, some get wasted.
1,Phones seemed fine but one handset stayed lighted all the time so I returned the whole thing.  Also, I tried to use the phone with a headset (the same one I use everyday with my cell) and the party I was speaking with could not understand a word.  Don't know why that was!
1,Item is not "ValueMailers Brand" as described (ordered from epackstore) and they are smaller than "ValueMailers Brand" #0 and do not have a pull tab like ValueMailers brand.
1,I agree with the guy who said these things are NOT full and the printer says they're empty when they're not.  Shaking them does almost nothing to help.  I love the way the old dependable R200 works but using it just isn't practical.  With the 5 color IC's installed, the Black ink from a 3rd party did work with this product.		Refill Ink hasn't worked for me.  Next time it gets empty, I'll say bye to the R200.
1,Not only did these take forever to receive, they came bent as anything, chalk was broken and smeared all over.  These went into the garbage upon arrival!  I am so disappointed even with not spending more than $10 on them!
1,Doesn't work right. My admin spends so much time going thru their "maintenance procedure" to get it to work a little, then again and again. She is threatening to get us a different mail meter if I didn't order direct from Neopost...so I did and have averted her wrath!
1,These cartridges used to last me an entire year and several reams of paper.		Now they barely make it three months. Lexmark service has always been very gracious, and helpful, my X7675 has been replaced twice under warranty, and I've sent back failed cartridges many times. Ever since they changed the place of manufacture, these cartridges leak, the heads fall off, they come with no ink etc... etc... I've never had a worse cartridge in my life (okay, the HP Deskjet 930C had worse cartridges but that was 15 years ago now). The black is more effected than the color which is a huge problem for me because I print very little color.		I'm now starting the process to replace this printer because I can't find good ink for it anymore. Mechanically it is still in excellent condition, but I just can't afford almost $50 very three months when my other printers are going three and four times that far on the same $50.		It's a shame because Lexmark is my favorite printer company, I've owned many of their models and never had a problem before. Lexmarks have always been incredibly (and I mean incredibly) durable and cheap to own, until now.		I used to have a Z series that I kept in the back of my truck for printing invoices, the ink was like $30 and I could drop it without harming it. What happened guys? Now a $200 printer is made a paperweight by ink cartridges. Talk about captive products. Get it together!
1,This is soooooo small and flimsy looking.  I was not impressed.  Better off with a generic Kantek brand acrylic tape dispenser that is larger, works better, from amazon for less.
1,Already reviewed but since then the shredder has started to get louder each use. Probably going to blow-apart or quit after warranty is out. Figures.	I keep getting this item to review. Stop sending me this item to review.
1,I bought these boxes to have on hand for shipping artwork. However, they are not glued well enough, so when you try to put them together they tear apart. The only way to use them is to strongly tape the 4" sides before trying to assemble them.
1,First time using.  These are like crayons and solid form of a gel.  It leaves oily residue on hand.  I wanted lighter shades of colors but these are too light.  Very hard to see orange, blue and green are indistinguishable, assume yellow disappears, and pink is too dark for me - may interfere with text.  Since it is a crayon type, and oval in size, it leaves about 1/2" mark, way too wide.  It will be impossible to mark precisely.  The mark it leaves is also not uniform in color.  It is blotchy like printer about to die.  I think this is one fail by sharpie.
1,I really want to love this pen, but for $30 it should be constructed better. The clip on the cap became loose and has since fallen apart. There doesn't seem to be a way to just clip these back together either. Such a shame.
1,This erases well and my daughter is happy with it in her playroom, but it's cheaply made. We have had it for only a few weeks and the cheap plastic frame has broken and the part that holds the marker busted. The cork is extremely thin. The magnets are very cute, though.
1,I bought this thinking I could place it on the page of the book and it would be magnified.  Wrong.  You have to hover it over what you're reading in order for it to work.  Would not have ordered it if I'd realized that.  It's okay for looking up phone numbers or reading the small print, but not for books, which is what I wanted it for.
1,This did not provide a smooth surface for me!  I purchased it because of all the high reviews and also because some of the reviews said their mouse slid smoothly on it.  This was not my case.  It was a soft and smooth surface, however, my mouse did not slide easily on it.  It did not work for me.
1,I used these in my new brother printer and was delighted with the savings, until my printer broke down.		It is best to use these only after your printer warranty expires. They void your warranty. My printer is only two months old and I just spent $250 to replace it. Now my Brother printer and remaining cartridges are headed for the waste bin.		An expensive lesson learned.		I can't say that these ink carts caused the printer's failure, it could have been an issue with the printer itself rather than the ink. Regardless of the cause, losing the warranty on a new item does not justify the savings.
1,Based on the mixed reviews (and the inexpensive price), I bought this for my church hoping that it would turn out like the 5-star reviewers' printers.  Good thing for return policies.  I printed about 6 CDs on it -- only one looked good.  The rest would be missing a letter here or there or there would be a smear or the text would be all over the place.  I have included a picture of the CD that convinced me that it wasn't just a cartridge issue, as well as a picture of the unit.		The printer is a nice size, very compact, but I will be trying the Casio CW-100 now.
1,I bought it here it was supposed to be NEW and Genuine.	But I got an opened unit, NO seal, NO yellow cover, NO instructions, NO orig box, it was just wrapped hastily in bubble wrap (small bubbles single layer) and put in an already used amazon box with cracks.  Upon inspection, the roller was dusty and had hair on it!	I left a poor review for the seller, but he begged me to delete the review and for shipping refund. If anything I should have returned the item but I needed to use it.  Upon use it leaked all over the place, I had to spend a long time maintaining the unit and wiping with dry (not wet) paper towels.  It worked for a day and then slowly it leaked all over again!  The fax came in all totally smudged with ink. I thought my machine was old and had a tech come over to look, We replaced the toner and it worked fine, WTH?! I pay good money for bad crap, never again! $65 here vs $99 @ Office Depot, but you get what you pay for!
1,damn, it terrible , the liquid inside make me hurt.
1,These envelopes have absolutely no usable adhesive.  There's a gum stick on the top flap and one on the bottom envelope.  Perhaps a bad batch or maybe the other reviewers don't care there's no adhesive or glue strip.  Its just like the glue dried up, which doesn't bode well for long term storage.  I've seen envelopes that lose their adhesive in adverse conditions like high humidity but that wasn't the case here.  Because they would all stick together or there would be some type of wet weather like impact to the paper.  That was not the case.  It is there, it just doesn't stick, and is like a gross gummy stripe where the adhesive should be.  Dry gummy, not glue gummy at all.  I gave it two stars, simply because I can still put paper in it, close it, and tape it myself.  But I bought this for self seal, and these do not self seal.
1,Ordered 2 boxes but only one was delivered. It was in poor condition and did not have file tabs/indexes inside the box. The folders are so flimsy that it's not worth asking for the missing box to be delivered.
1,The tabs themselves are nice and thick plastic, but they are not visible if you put things in sheet protectors. useless. of course I discovered this AFTER the return window, now I'm out 16$ LAME
1,Do not work...
1,All markers were dried up, absolutely useless. Money wasted.
1,I can't tell if these work, because the minute I put ONE of these in my printer (the magenta), I got an error "Black cartridge appears to be broken".	So I replaced the black, it seemed to prepare the cartridges, then it says the YELLOW cartridge is broken. Put the LD yellow one in, and it prepared, then said the CYAN was broken.  Mind you, the Black, Yellow, and Cyan were half-full (another manufacturer brand) and were working FINE before I put in the LD Products Magenta.		So, I took out all the LD ones, put the other ones back in, restarted, and everything works. I figured, "Huh, must be a fluke", so I tried it again. And AGAIN, the minute I put the LD cartridge in, it started giving me Errors on the OTHER cartridges.		This was NOT a fluke, it happened twice under testing and troubleshooting conditions.		Not only do these not work, they "broke" the other cartridges. Or at least the printer thought they were broken. After restart, the OLD cartridges worked fine.
1,The box arrived unmarked or dented, but the item inside had several issues.  First there were scratches all over the top of the desk.  There was a small chip of plastic broken out of each of the legs and another larger chip of plastic broken from an edge and that piece was within the product packaging.		It looked like a great design and would've been very nice to utilize but it seemed it wouldn't be holding up for very long, so I asked for a return on it.
1,This irresponsible company sold my 15 year phone number in a blink of the eye....	My credit card had expired while I was on an overseas trip.	When I came back, my phone was dead and my 15 year phone number was given away.		And they asked me to "pick another number" to continue with their service.	This is the act of utter stupidity...		Please avoid this company.		SHAME ON YOU PhonePower !	SHAME ON YOU PhonePower !	SHAME ON YOU PhonePower !
1,Was well used and dirty.  I returned it :(
1,All inkjet printers (Canon, HP, Epson, etc...) are a rip off; they cost so much and give you so little ink (gets low only after 10~15 pages).  This is the same tactics as men's shaver replacement blade.		The cost should be cut by half.
1,This is the worst printer we ever bought.  After one year it needed new ink.  We didn't use it very often.  It wouldn't accept the correct ink and finally printed a streaked page.  We worked with it for several hours and called a tech support person at Epson who did not help.  My husband smashed it on the sidewalk and I took it in for recycling.
1,Well...if you want a tidal wave of ink after you attempt to try and prime the pen, then this might be one way to go. I followed the instructions carefully, and the first thing that happened, was that the nib got stuck up inside the pen. When I finally managed to retrieve it (with tweezers) the pen flooded and made a mess out of the test paper I was using with it. (Thank goodness it wasn't the drawing I was attempting to use it on.) I cleaned up the tip and tried again. Same result. I can't speak for this entire line of products, but this particular pen was a waste of money and effort. I hope they aren't all like that.
1,I've purchased these mini pencils numerous of times.  I like it for its little compact use and quality. In the beginning it works just great, then after some use I encounter later problems where the Pencils lead will slip loose and will not stay put, like the mechanism is malfunctioned. Then the top of the pencil comes apart, the eraser gets stuck in its holder. I can't keep the eraser up and out to use. So overall, I would not spend time purchasing this pencil because it is poorly made.
1,FIRST, THE OTHER INK CARTRIDGE IS IN THE PEN!		My experience isn't good. The nib is great, but the ink doesn't flow fast enough and I have to write very slowly and put water on the tip because it dries out if I hesitate. Still, even doing that, it skips and just doesn't work. Probably worth the price. Get what you pay for.
1,Normally I don't factor pricing or shipping into a review, because the price can change any time and the shipping isn't really the under the vendor's control.		In this case, the shipping was fine, but the price seems really high for such a commodity.  You can pick these up at your local OfficeStapleDepotMax for less money and get a larger quantity.		The index cards themselves are fine.  An index card is pretty much an index card.  These come with both a back and a front and four nifty square corners.  We use them for all sorts of purposes around the house.  I won't be buying any of these Mead cards for $3.25 per hundred though.
1,Tiny with hardly any paper in them.
1,The firmware update for this HP product will not run on Leopard (OSX.5). I have sent emails to HP asking for a solution (both to their pre-sale group and their mac support group), but there has been NO REPLY. Although I haven't purchased this printer, HP's support on this issue leaves something to be desired. I might consider the printer, but designing a firmware update that is operating system specific is quite stupid as: 1) there is no good reason to do so; 2) Leopard is not exactly a recent development; 3) if the firmware update was important for the product to work properly (which one would presume to be the case), then making it work should be something of a priority.  HP claims in its literature that the printer is compatible with "10.4 and greater."  This is obviously an untruth.
1,Unfortunately when it said for home use, I assumed that photographs would be fine especially because of all the positive reviews.  But by saying "for home use", it really does imply, and rightly so that it is NOT for professional use where you want a completely bubble free surface for photos and/or artwork.  If I was using it just for documents, I would say it works fine where tiny little bubbles wouldn't really make much difference.  But for any kind of art work where you want first class quality, no, I do not advise buying this one.  I wasted money on this machine and the expensive metallic photo paper I bought to make laminated tiles with my artwork.
1,Scanner garbled the text and often missed entire sections.  Translating to PDF was not consistent.  I returned this item.
1,the magnets aren't flush with the metal cups that hold them. The magnets can't contact the surface you're trying to adhere them too directly. They slide down with a few pieces of paper in them. That's on brushed stainless. Forget about anything textured and/or painted. Crap-tastic!
1,Well, not what I expected.  They are very light, as in the ink.  I gave them to mom who colors and she likes them.  I will keep them for that reason.
1,Setting up the wireless was a real chore. You need to add the printer MAC address to your LAN first, then add the wireless network and password to the printer. When the printer went to sleep the MAC apparently was lost and needed to be set up again. The manual print feeder tray on the front only holds one page/envelope at a time (can't stack multiples in it for when you are running a job with non letter size documents).
1,I like this printer very much, but "parts included" is missing an insert for the lower paper input tray. It is supposed to be used to print CDs and fit into the lower paper cassette tray. In the accompanying photo, it is on the lower right.
1,From the moment I opened the package this NEVER worked. Total waste of time and money. Look elsewhere.
1,Two of these fell apart right upon opening up. Maybe the inventory was old and the glue dried, who knows.  Anyways, I kept them and taped them up and am still using.  I didn't think it was worth sending back.  Sorry, but I have to give this a 2 star rating for quality.
1,the construction material is very thin expected it to be made with heavier wire
1,Labels look the same, but...they jammed up a Dymo printer and I returned them.	In fact to get the labels out of the printer i broke the printer...  REJECT
1,Expensive for old technology.  Sure you can put your cell phone on bluetooth but I don't find that's worth it honestly.  Just keep my cell charged up and then I don't have to worry about the lack of reception these phones have in a large home.
1,54 but only 6 colors.
1,Broke after just a few months of use. Spend the extra money and get an all metal sharpener.
1,cardboard
1,I bought a set and really like the size, the triangular shape, and that the eraser is very good.  BUT, the pencil sharpener doesn't sharpen them to a writable point.  It just chews up the pencil.  I bought a sharpener used for flat carpenters pencils hoping it would sharpen better, but it doesn't.  I have read reviews where others had to spend considerable dollars to find a sharpener that really worked.  If Dixon would provide a sharpener that worked, I would love to buy more of the pencils.
1,You get what you pay for.  We decided to try these cheapest generics instead of spending three times as much for genuine H-P items.  Upon installing these, the first hundred or so images had repeating black bars on the output.  Those black bars have mostly disappeared now, but the quality is not up to H-P quality.  Next time, we will move up the price scale a bit when trying generics, and will see if the results are better. It appears that the cheapest available are not worth what you pay if quality output is important.		I tried to leave "no stars" for the review, but the system will not accept "no stars."  Therefore, do not misinterpret the "one star" as an endorsement of any degree.
1,3 out of five where defective cartridges.
1,Very difficult to write with as much as I love the size and fit of the actual fountain pen for writing. I have small hands and have to handwrite for 90% of my profession. There must be something wrong with the nib.  I use Noodlers Ink in all my fountain pens (including several Mont Blanc) and this Lamy Safari ink flow is terrible.  I'd rather write with a dimestore ballpoint.
1,Too thin. Tears easily
1,Maybe it's just my lack of coordination, but I have a heck of a time keeping the tape from falling back on itself. The dispenser doesn't do a very good job of holding the tape in place once a portion has been torn off. The tape itself is very good - strong, sticky, clear. But, for me, the dispenser is a deal-breaker.
1,A regular pen is easier to use in one's left hand than these silly items.
1,This was the most frustrating thing I've handled in a long time.		I bought it replace a whiteboard with a damaged surface. My intent was to apply it over the old surface. Forget it. I could find no way to get all the air bubbles out of it.
1,Nice idea, but made of very flimsy/easy to crack plastic, especially at the hinge.  I don't see this lasting longer than a week with a heavy MBP from a few years back so I'm returning it.
1,$15 down the drain, today I have to skip lunch.  Stomach pain means I will never forget this crummy company. Loaded it 12 times, always an error of some time, put back the dry one NO PROBLEM.  Avoid this incompetent, high priced fly by night
1,Just okay.  Nothing special
1,won't last. In fact, in our case, it lasted for 4 uses, then came apart. And that before it looked like moths "chew" on it.	Nanny used it to wipe dry markers and crayons off of a white board.	Reviewers in awe about this product and with "magic" in their reviews must live in an alternate dimension.		Bad for the wallet and for the environment if I would have to buy one every 4 days or earlier. Ridiculous!
1,The tape is good, but seriously, they sent a tape holder without the plastic insert to hold the tape........nice, makes the tape holder useless.
1,I  HAD THIS SHARPENER SINCE MARCH AFTER ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS IN AMAZON, ONLY FOR IT TO STOP WORKING AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS. IT WAS PURCHASED FROM WHITE STAR. WHEN I CALLED THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER	SCHOOL SMART--THEY SAID THAT THIS COMPANY WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO SELL THIS PRODUCT TO BEGIN WITH, AND URGED ME TO CONTACT THE COMPANY--NO RESPONSE!  LUCKILY I PURCHASED FROM AMAZON AND THEY RETURNED IT PROMPTLY AND ISSUED ME A REFUND. I AM SURPRISED THAT IT JUST STOPPED WORKING--AND DONT UNDERSTAND ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS... NUMBER ONE?? NOT AT ALL--SO YOUR RESEARCH!
1,This didn't work for us as the grid was larger than we expected.
1,Like to know why this thing has TWO, count em, TWO black ink cartridges?  It apparently only uses one of them, and if it runs out, you cannot use the other one to continue printing, even if you only want a gray scale print.  STUPID! Any printer should be able to continue to print, even monochrome, if you want it to. There is apparently no such option for this thing, as Canon would rather sell ink than printers. Am returning to brand X.
1,Display on printer stopped working. I have $300 in spare ink, and a useless printer. HP cannot get parts. The only parts available are used parts from China. The customer service, is terrible. Scan quality rates at about 35 on a scale of 0-100. Print quality is 65 on a scale of 0-100. Ink consumption is 95 on a scale of 0-100. Ink price is 50 on a scale of 0-100. Copy speed is 52 on a scale of 0-100. Longevity is 13 on a scale of 0-100. Reliability is 32 on a scale of 0-100. Value is 9 on a scale of 0-100.  The printer sat mostly unused in an air conditioned office for 3 years, while I spent 60% of my time in another office.
1,No...!  PLAIN Writing Tablet !!!
1,The buttons/keypad does not work, or not detected on automated phone calls.  Since many companies, pharmacy, require number inputs, makes this phone useless.
1,A bit too heavy to write with if the cap is on, whereas the ink doesn't flow readily if it hasn't been used in a couple of days. Also as another reviewed had already posted, the nib is scratchy. (I have 3 Cross pens that I love, so maybe this isn't a fair comparison... The ink used was the same, Mont Blanc.) Obviously I won't be using it. And since it ain't worth the trouble to return to China, this purchase has proven a total waste of money and even my time just trying to "get used to it"...
1,I installed the cartridge and noticed everything I printed had horizontal lines going through it. I wanted to put in a warranty claim but couldn't find the sellers contact info anywhere.
1,I purchased a fiskars paper trimmer 154470-1004 LED SureCut Folding Rotary Paper Trimmer (12") and It was over $75.  I was hoping that it was the one that was self sharpening and never need new blades a friend told me about. But I couldn't find it so I searched for the price She had paid.  She was very happy.  This is not her paper cutter! Unfortunately, this is the worse paper cutter I have ever used. I love sharp knives, sharp scissors and sharp paper cutters!  You have to bear down, cut, and cut, and cut and cut and cut, and your card stock still does not cut so you have to use your scissors.  I am so very disappointed.  After all my other Fiskar scissors and cheaper cutters, I am deeply let down by this cutter.  It does have a nice LED light to show you your paper is not cut.  That is all I can say good.  Wish I had tried it out earlier and returned it before I threw away the box.  I am actually going to purchase a new blade hoping that they just shipped this one with a dull blade.
1,This printer was a disappointment even though I only had it for a few days. I'm an author and publisher and I create my own marketing materials and my own book covers.	The good side: Setup was clear and easy. The step-by-step instructions led me to believe Brother had spent considerable time in making the process go smoothly. I found the paper capacity to be far in excess of my old inkjet (Canon MX-882), separated into two trays.	When it came time to do a test page (the cover for my new book), I discovered that the 8.5" x 11" photo paper could be inserted into the rear access point--but just so...it asked several times to reset it. Holding my breath, I began to print. (And then things went wonky but more on that later).	I loved the touch-screen interface. It was intuitive, responsive and just worked. I sailed through the setup process quite easily. Again, it set my expectations pretty high. I loved the ability to scan and print 11x17 pages. I won't have to go to Staples to get my small posters printed.		The not-so-good side: The ink cartridges supplied were "starter"-size, so not full capacity (seriously?). This reinforced the notion that Brother was really trying to sell razor blades, not razors, (printer ink). During the setup process, I was warned repeatedly that lightning would strike me dead if I dared to use 3rd-party ink. Well, perhaps not, but it got tiresome. I get it. Buy Brother ink.		What was not clear during setup and operation, is that the printer thought that tray #2 (the one on the bottom) was the "primary" tray and it had to have paper in it for the printer to proceed in at least one case.		While Windows 10 could see my LAN printer immediately, I ran the the setup DVD to make sure the right drivers were loaded. It took a long time--probably fifteen minutes or longer, showing far too much detail as it listed each and every single file and registry setting being installed. Why is it that hardware and software companies think ordinary mortals (non-developers) need to know this detail? What could have made setup easier was a checklist of "stuff" that Brother thinks everyone should need. On retrospect, I didn't need hardly any of it. And no, uninstalling the printer did NOT uninstall any of these "essential" tools.		Registration was easy. Brother already knew which other printers I owned, but they had an OLD phone number so that was hard to change. Eventually, it let me add this one quite easily--as long as I had the serial number. Too bad they don't have a way to "un-register" the printer as I returned it. Oh darn. I gave away the ending.		The printer does an auto-alignment when it first starts up with a lot of swooshing and other steam-punk sounds, and the result is an ambiguous set of four colored blocks of little rectangles--and another reminder to use Brother ink. Checking online, I could see that's what was expected (I think). My old Canon test page was far clearer and far more comprehensive, testing density and other aspects not displayed here. It also printed a Windows test page which (as it turns out) has the printer serial number, so I didn't have to go back to the garage and find the box after all. But more on the test page later.		The Ugly: So my first print job was the gorgeous full-color cover of my new book. When I checked, the entire page was far (far) lighter than I had seen with the default color settings on my old Canon 882. AND it had missing pixels. It appears that the print head is about an inch wide and the jets at the edge were not printing. This meant there were several "lines" on the page with no or spotty (so to speak) printing. I also noticed what appeared to be "scrape" marks as if the ink had been smeared as the head moved over the page (but that's just a guess). It was unacceptable.		This is where I got on the phone with the Brother support team (in the Philippines--I asked where he was). His English was fine, and he was very helpful and spoke at my level (I'm a tech guy too). We spent two hours on the phone and then another forty-five minutes with the "supervisor") trying everything imaginable--and using up several sheets of glossy photo paper. One interesting conclusion was "If the test page prints okay, there's nothing wrong with the printer." So, in their mind, if the printer thinks it's okay, then it's okay, no matter what's printing. (LOL)		In the end, she (the supervisor) suggested I return the printer to be repaired at a local repair shop. I called them. It would take 10 days to turn the printer around. I'm glad I bought it from Amazon because they took it back in a heartbeat. Thinking it was just a bad print head (and so did they), I ordered another. When it arrived (two days later) I went through setup again by the numbers to make sure any issues were not because I was an idiot. It printed exactly the same way--with the same missing pixels and something else. The printer could not print my book's manuscript either (a Word document). Since my books are formatted a 5.25" x 8" (so I can see the page breaks in Word), the document prints with enormous margins on 8.5 x 11 paper on my Brother Laser printer (and on my old Canon 882). The new Brother insisted on printing this document in landscape mode. There was no setting, no option, no prayer, no nothing we could perform to get it to change its mind. When the Brother support tech suggested I reformat my book, we were done. I was on the phone to Amazon and the second one went back. (Big sigh). I ordered a Canon MX-992. Let's see how that one works out.		Folks, I really liked this printer. It had a few nuances that were not great, but I really could have used the new features and high resolution, but it has to print. It has to print right the first time and every time. I should not have to do anything special in my documents or lift my left foot (exactly) three inches off the floor to get it to print. It should just do what every other printer I've bought over the last forty years has done--print.
1,The magnet is strong and the clip holds well, but the magnet sits lowers than the metal that holds it in, and it scratches everything!
1,Well, I usuually have a good experience but not this time.  The 2nd package of boards was 3 weeks late - and the boards were in poor condition when they arrived.  But, in the meantime a wonderful person on Amazon Chat (Olean) was very helpful and sent me another box which I did receive and they look mostly ok.  It did delay my conference project but I think it will end up ok.  Oh well, can't get it right all the time.  Thanks for listening.  Diane Reitz
1,I have not been doing that much printing - occasional articles I want my GF to be able to read.  These cartridges gave me less than half the capacity of the OEM small / standard cartridge --- these are supposed to be the XLs - Extended Length - much more capacity / should have been at least double the standard cart.	I will never spend another penny with House of Toners.  I definitely feel cheated.
1,This safe is way overpriced due to its very poor quality. It arrived on time and when I tried to install the batteries, the battery compartment fell out of its mounting and would not snap back into place. I have returned it.
1,I have purchased a lot of twine through the years, but this has to be the worst. The sickening odor is the strongest I have ever smelled on twine, like a mixture of some unidentified chemical and petrol. I couldn't stand it at my craft area, so I took it to a different area, and it made the entire room smell bad. I gave the twine over a week to air out, thinking maybe it would dissipate, but it still stinks sooooo bad.		I totally cannot use this for wrapping or anything craft-related due to the ingrained nasty smell, so when my husband asked if we had any twine for tying up some cardboard, I handed him this (then washed the noxious odor off of my hands). He came back in with a fistful of broken twine and told me it couldn't even secure the cardboard bundles, it just kept breaking. This is the first twine I've bought that couldn't even do that. I honestly can't think of one good thing to use this for, it's that bad.		I won't purchase this brand of twine ever again, what a waste of money and time, and I regret giving it a try.
1,Not actually Lime Green!
1,Doesn't work at all!!!!  Really can't figure out why, but not worth the cost to return so in the trash they go!  What a waste of money!  Even had my assistant try, but she got the same results!
1,Buyer beware...this is a Target product & though it says "pack of two" it is indeed just one.  I had to call Target to get my money refunded.  Very disappointed.  False advertising!		The product itself however is great. It's comfy, comforms well to your wrist & doesn't collect dirt easily.  Just avoid getting ripped off on here.  It's available at Office Depot & Offic Max stores locally for the same price.
1,Charging base for second receiver stopped working after about a year. Contacted Panasonic and they want $13+shipping for a replacement charger. (Do I have "sucker" written across my forehead?)
1,The pens are all dried out --- they are always capped and very little use.  I wish I could have given the pens ZERO, but I will settle for one.  I should have taken heed to the reviewers who complained about the pens drying out.  Do not make the same mistake --- DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
1,Don't bother with the sharpener that comes with them. It breaks the lead and wastes a lot of the pencil. Stick to sharpening with a knife.
1,It jams very easy and puts the wrong coins in the wrong slot. Not worth the trouble. I ended up having to roll by hand and returning counter.
1,I bought this as a gift and everyone had problems hearing the person who received this phone. The speakers voice sounded so low, almost like a whisper.  There was an obvious defect with voice transmission. Returned and got another brand and everything is fine now.
1,DID NOT WORK IN PRINTER (NO INK) I GUESS  wanted us to return..... to much trouble.... would have liked credit or replacement
1,Not bad, but I've wasted massive amounts of time trying to format labels in Access. Drivers keep resetting to unwanted labels.
1,I get my cartridges refilled at  a local outlet for about half the cost now.  Long live capitalism, when it works for me.
1,UPDATE:	I think this telo device is not all that impressive...I just learned, to get, what I believe to be basic services, caller id, call forwarding, call blocking and even to listen to an incoming voicemail call, you have to have their premier service which cost $9.99 a month plus additional taxes. Ooma representative also told me the basic taxes are not a few dollars but near $6.00 month. Also, even with the premier service, you cannot just enter a phone number to forward, you must go online and jump through hoops through their site to find and enter your call forwarding number. This is a noted feature on the handset which does not work. I'll give this a try for now and possibly restate an okay (3 star) rating..		ORIGINAL REVIEW:	I got this handset bundled with the Ooma Telo Home Phone Service base unit for $89.00. I am happy with the service so far...Setup took all but 5 minutes although the updates took another 10-15 minutes to complete. After all, I was up and running with phone service and voicemail. The sound quality on the handset is very clear and the volume can be adjusted to liking. I connected a cordless phone to the Ooma base unit and its sound quality is also very good. I did try an older corded phone but it produced a buzzing sound. This may have been temporary or due to initial setup.		I haven't yet tried the contact picture capabilities but, as a basic phone, I am finding this will probably replace my landline phone service.
1,These are simply terrible.  The colored leads are so pale you can barely see it on paper.  I bought them to trace around stencils but they are too weak to even do that well.  Marketed toward children, I believe.  I wouldn't buy them even  for  a child as these would produce a lot of frustration and unhappiness no matter what age group using them.  Yuck!
1,The item was to have a clear view well there is no view just plain white binder not the product I ordered.
1,Returned - poorly designed
1,So disappointed.  I've used these pads for so many years...and these were just obviously rejects.  The holes at the top were so very close to the edge, and the pages were so 'stuck' that it was literally impossible to turn/flip from one page to the next without tearing.  I have an older pad, and even took time to compare the two.  An obvious difference.  Disappointed in paying for and getting inferior product.  And worse - all 5 tablets had the same issue!  Disappointed -- VERY.  PS - they unexpectedly gave me a free pen - big woop!  Wonder why!  VERY disappointed.
1,Does not register with  my apple Changed to one star as my HP Printer doesn't recognize the new cartridge. Completely stalled the printer so I cannot work even in black and white only until I replace the tri-color....DO NOT PURCHASE this one!!
1,For it's cost, it's not a very good phone .  The charge does not last as stated by the manufacture .
1,This mousing surface does not function at all with my new Explorer Touch mice. The pointer jumps all over the screen. Not sure if these are not compatible with laser mice, but if so, it is unforgiveable that they do not mention this anywhere in the description or on the box. If you have a laser mouse, do not buy these mousing surfaces.
1,To small don't stick waist of money!!!
1,These are being used by office staff and I have no information regarding any problems with them.
1,Does not take anywhere near 11 pieces of paper
1,As usual you have a satisfied customer.
1,Received ink today and the black ink works fine but the color is printing streaky like its running out.  Very displeased.  I am a teacher and my school doesn't provide ink so I was trying to save a little by buying the remanufactured ink but I deeply regret it.		Edited:  Manufacturer sent a replacement.  Will update review when I try it out.
1,Not what I expected in a fine point pen.  The pens come in a nice little case to keep them organized but outside of that, they suck!  Most of them in order to start them writing you have to always scratch back and forth.  I will not be making another purchase of these pens again.  I will stick with FORAY Stylemark Fine.  I do not recommend these DONG-A-Fine.  If you purchase them you will feel like a DING-A-LING, so don't waste your money!!!
1,This pencil is cheap.  The eraser got jammed into the pencil and I had to throw it away.  It's poorly made.  I'm an engineering student so maybe I use it more than a lot of the other people giving it 5 stars, but I cant believe how well reviewed these are.  The lead comes out fine, and feeds reliably.  The eraser situation just sucks though.  And once the eraser is jammed, you cannot refill lead, you cannot erase.  Totally ruins the pencil.
1,I cannot get into the pen. The spring is with the less coiled face down. Never had a problem before.
1,Magic jack doesn't disclose before porting your number to magic jack include: Ported number renewal fee (Never heard of any company charging renewal of ported number  2. If you want to release the same number and move it to another carrier (because of terrible call quality and terrible customer service), they will charge you another $30.00 whammy on you.  This is a hog wash. There is no call log, no phone customer service, on top of these unscrupulous fees.  They never mention that they will charge renewal fee on a ported number and they will also charge $30.00 if you take the number to another carrier before your porting transaction with magic jack is complete. This is unbelievable!!		one year experience: Lost calls, choppy calls, NO CALL LOGS,and for call forwarding you have to go through plethora of web links and chart sessions to get the web link and you have to do the same to remove the call forwarding too.  I am closing my magicjack account and will move to either Nettalk or vonage or Ooma: none of them have ported number fee, and no phone number release fees.  I know, vonage and Nettalk provide call log for free.
1,Not worth the price.  I regret getting it adhesive part doesn't work that well and little too thick than what i wanted.
1,Poor Quality Control. The gold pins  to make connection to printer are very flimsy at best.
1,Its not great
1,These markers are too light.  They are hard to see when I write with them.  I had hoped for bright vibrant colors, but they don't write very well.
1,Mines a lemon. Would never fax .Ive had this model before. I know how to use it. 3 months later,when I turn it on, it will sayPlease wait then shut off completely 9 out of 10 times.	Ive had brother all in ones before and been very pleased with them. I think THIS one is a dud.	I regret purchasing it from Amazon. Had I bought from Costco or anyplace that had a more generous return policy.	I would not be stuck with a purchase that came to $150 with Tax.	Now its $150 out the window.	Think I should save my $99 on Amazon Prime and Join Costco.
1,It's a size of maybe a 50 cent coin, Said large ! I am new to this adult coloring hobby so I'm learning what to buy or not ! For the price they are asking I hope it lasts a very long time. Returning would cost more than its worth so I'll experiment with it. Not used product yet for erasing or blending
1,While the pouches themselves were fine, the plastic used for the necessary hanging portion has an incredibly strong, foul, truly offensive, skunky smell that literally permeates the room so it can be smelled from so many yards away that I cannot use them and have to replace all of the hanging portions with something else.
1,Likewise my comments on the black high yields "original" ink cartridge--- not happy at all- these didn't last as long as "regular"sized cartridges.
1,Yes - these are less money,, but they give false "signals" to the printer on needing to be replaced.  Or perhaps the message is correct and they only last a fraction of the time...Just don't buy these.
1,When you compare this phone to the superior Uniden, this is what you get. The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Uniden-Black-Slimline-Corded-Phone-Slim1260BK/dp/B0028Q82S6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Uniden Black Slimline Corded Phone (Slim1260BK)</a>&nbsp;uses newer technology. The working parts are more compact, because it uses integrated circuits, which are cheaper and more reliable. The AT&T 210 has many discrete components that can and often do fail.		Both are assembled in China, but assembling the Uniden involves fewer steps. Anyway, I've had two AT&T 210's fail on me. One had a defective mouthpiece that probably never worked properly. The other had a busted ringer. I bought one Uniden and it has worked perfectly--my phone nightmare is over.		The Uniden is also cheaper--another advantage of integrated circuits.
1,very small but does what it is supposed to do - but it's too small to really notice on a counter.
1,Anything from a tight hinge to a cat can push the door in spite of the door stopper.  These slide.  I like the look and weight, but they would only be good for light doors with sticky floors.
1,Poor quality and they leak.
1,Pulls paper in to quickly which resulted in lop sided printing.  Badly designed . Didn't like anything about this machine . returned it
1,when you attempt to peel the label from the backing, it curls up onto itself. Honestly, you need one hand to peel the label and two more hands to hold the edges to keep it from curling.  These are NOT the same as the last batch I ordered...wish I could find those again...sigh.
1,Inkpress' Luster emulsion is excellent but unfortunately the quality of their paper base tends to vary. In this case it's warped (or wavy) even before ink is applied. I've bought this size as well as their larger sizes before and this is the first time I've seen this problem. So just be aware that when you buy their paper there's no consistency to their product.
1,Purchased October 2016 - Product is good.  It does move on the carpet and has to be re positioned but it is not that often it has to be done .  I have had it a month and use it extensively.  So far it is worth it..........		Update: August 24, 2017 - Product cracking have to trash it, changed from 4 stars to two.
1,In 45 days *2* of these have broken on me. I am not punching anything crazy - 1/2 pages of paper at a time. The first was in the 30 day return window (like within the 1st week, so I was hoping it was a fluke).....the second just broke at 35 days. This is absolutely ridiculous. I have a regular binder punch (swingline) i've had for 15 years and use with 15 sheets of paper at a time (weekly!). SOOO disappointing and no good alternative punch.
1,The price for the toner & drum was excellent. Unfortunately, the first box arrived kind of smashed up and it looked like someone had thrown the toner & the drum into a box, without any packing, and shipped it.  YoYo was great and sent me a replacement at no charge and credited me with a portion of the cost of the order. That was customer service at its best, however, I am now having ongoing problems with getting a message "Drum Error".  I have to move the green slider across the corona wire and re-insert the toner cartridge every few copies.  The big globs of toner will come out on the paper.  Additionally, the quality of the copies and prints are not as good as the Brother toner I had before I bought the YoYo toner & drum.  So while the price is right, and their customer service is very good, the overall quality is poor. I would not order from them again.
1,One package arrived all broken and the box was in bad condition. The second was not much better. Nice on paper though.
1,The best I can say is that it does print.  And the printing is okay.  Just okay. It's also simple to use and lightweight.  That's the best I can say about it.		But there's a lot on the downside.  It's very noisy.  Very.  And it needs to be turned on and off manually.  That is a pain in the neck.		But perhaps the worst thing about it is that it eats ink.  Eats it.  HP ink is just too expensive for the amount this printer consumes, so I switched to less expensive "compatible" cartridges.  They worked fine, for much less money.  Until 5 or 6 weeks ago, when, after I installed a new cartridge, I found a window on my computer screen telling me that the printer would work only with HP cartridges and would not work with the non-HP cartridge I had installed.		Apparently, one of the periodic software updates was one that enabled HP to police the ink I put in my printer.  I was outraged at this effort by HP to force me to by their overpriced ink, and it's the last HP product I will ever buy.  I packed up the printer, gave it to charity, and bought a much better (Canon PIXMA) printer that I'm much happier with.
1,The printing speed is too slow. And also the ink is easy to use up. It only supports few paper printing.
1,I purchased this printer in Dec. 2010. It was my first Kodak printer purchase and I was very pleased with it. It did everything I needed it to do (print, scan, copy, and fax). Good print quality and very fast drying ink. Also nice low priced ink refills. I didn't use the printer a lot, on average maybe a couple pages printed per day.		One day last week I went to print something and I got an error message on the screen indicating the print carriage was jammed. I went through the steps provided on the screen and still jammed. I turned the printer off and back on, still jammed. Did some extensive research on the internet and found this to be a very common problem with this printer. I then contacted Kodak's customer service, and while they are very friendly they told me "sorry, the printer is dead and your warranty is expired". I was very dissapointed to hear this. They then went on to suggest that I should go ahead and buy a new Kodak printer because "no one else has such low prices on ink refills"!  I couldn't believe they were telling me this. So it doesn't matter that the printer dies after two years of minimal use because the ink cartridges are so affordable?		That was my first and last Kodak printer.
1,These are too thin.  They curl up and if you only print one label at a time its really hard to try and use the second label.  I will not buy from this listing again :-(
1,The uni-ball Vision Elite pen has the worst ink I have ever used. When writing, you will occasionally smear the ink with your hand, and as soon as it smears, it becomes permanent and dried. This pen should be illegal and the company should go bankrupt for producing such a terrible product, and ever letting it exit the testing phase. I bought a huge pack at Costco and used one to mark a porous, paper surface. After sitting in a ventilated room for 3 minutes, the ink still smeared and made a terrible mess. I am re-doing my labels and will return the pens to Costco. I even did a follow-up test on various surfaces/papers, tried all of the pens and colors, and allowed for many minutes of drying time, even blowing my breath on it like it was ink from a drying Sharpie. This product should be removed from the market. It's as if the pen is missing the chemical component that dries the ink. I will say that the pen body and mechanical parts look and feel awesome...but do NOT buy anything from Newell Rubbermaid Office Products, Oak Brook, IL 60523 (A Newell Rubbermaid Company) until they fix this ridiculous flaw. Be skeptical that say this pen is the best, because those people may have used it once and never noticed that it fails to dry effectively. -J
1,Hard to erase
1,I only hate it because it was the wrong one for my printer.  Amazon took it back - no problem!
1,My HP printer would not recognize the black.  Still have not tried the color.  HP has a lock on anyone buying a HP printer.
1,I've been a Neat Company Fan & Dedicated Customer for a long time. I had NeatReceipts for many years and then decided to upgrade to NeatDesk with NeatWorks Software on 9/16/10. I loved the faster scan times, scanning front & back, etc. Then, recently on 2/16/11, the software NeatWork lost all of my data. Luckily, I back up monthly so I was able to restore the data and only lost one month's of work. Then, I started noticing scanning problems with Wide Black Band Through Image. I immediately contacted customer service which is only available through their website by opening a case. A rep responded with some instructions to try and resolve the problem. I followed the instructions and the problem wasn't fixed. I updated the case by explaining this and I got the same instructions as a response. At this point, I figured out that customer service didn't exist. I asked why I was getting the same instructions after I reported the instructions followed did not fix the issue and then a different rep gave me different instructions. I followed those instructions without any success either. I updated the report and asked about the one year warranty since my purchase was within a year, and no response after that. I filed a compliant with the FTC, BBB and wanted others interested in this product to know before considering purchasing. What's funny is that the sales rep which is the only number provided try to sell me tech support annual fee. This is quite disappointing as I was a loyal fan. BUYER BEWARE!!! Customer service and warranty does not exist after purchase.
1,This is the second security stamp I have purchased & this one is not much better than the first. Perhaps none are what they advertise.
1,An absolute ripoff designed to run out twice as quick as as Canon's older mode printer cartridges! did! In the EU the same cartridges are almost twice the size as the US ones because their governments actually require companies like Canon to sell Ink carts with a minimum standard amount of Ink. But In the USA Canon cheats us all because we have no such consumer protections in place.
1,The cartridges were installed into my hp 6280 printer and the errors kept popping up. The printer errors ranged from empty ink cartridges to not compatable. I cleaned the printer heads and did a reset to wipe all errors and reinstalled the ink cartridges only to get the same errors. I finally gave up and reinstalled the original ink cartridges and all the errors went away. All I can say is stay away as it will cause you more headaches, you get what you pay for...
1,Whether you are a beginner, or an experienced colorer, these pens will be a huge disappointment. It is so true that you get what you pay for. Despite the fact that this product actually received several positive reviews, the pens are of extremely low quality. They are made from a very cheap plastic, and the plastic "case"  they come in is virtually unusable after the initial opening. All the colors have a grayish, dark undertone to the color, and the ink is far from free-flowing, and does not cover the paper smoothly. The "Swirl" colors are all similar in color, and when they dry they all end up that darkish gray color as well. The only pens I found to have a bright, eye catching shade were the few fluorescent pens, though the color is difficult to lay down effortlessly. Were it not for these 6 pens, I would have to give this set only 1 "star" as the overall value for your money is extremely poor. Spend a few extra dollars and purchase yourself some high quality pens that will give you a polished, professional look no matter how experienced your are!
1,The package I received today contained 6 markers that wrote so lightly that it looked like the ink must have totally dried up in every single one.  Waste of money.
1,Plantronics T20: 90% PERFECT, 10% DEADLY	This would be the perfect headset phone if not for a few deadly missteps that led me to return it.		Perfect:	--Quality build (solid), the right size, the right features (buttons for mute, hold, redial, conference, and flash, plus volume and tone controls). And the mute has a red indicator so you don't forget (although I'd prefer an indicator that flashed like on the Polycom conference phones).	--Also, high quality sound in the headset - I could hear the other party perfectly, with only a faint background hiss.		Deadly, starting with the most serious:	--The people I talked with said that I sounded distant. It appears that the microphone doesn't come forward far enough to pick up my voice well.	--The headset cord is not shielded and picks up noise from the computer. In particular, I had to be careful to route the cord so that it avoided the keyboard or it picked up a loud tone both parties heard.	--The headset cord is very thin and I worried that a minor mistake (such as catching it in a closing a desk drawer) would seriously damage it.	--There is no headset for the T20 that covers both ears (binaural). I called to verify this. Although the headset jack in the base is physically compatible with the binaural headset from my M12, the headset from the M12 does not work with the T20.		It seems like they could make this the perfect phone just by making a few straightforward engineering changes. But until then...		PS - There was always a low hiss in the headset. In looking into noise-canceling technology, I learned that these systems typically introduce a hiss of their own. In a noisy environment, you don't notice the hiss because the noise the circuitry takes out is much greater than the hiss it adds. But in a quiet environment like mine, there is no benefit to the noise-canceling feature and you hear the hiss. I can't guarantee that this was the source of the hiss I heard, but it seems likely. (There is no way to disable the noise-canceling circuitry.) I don't think the Amazon listing mentions the noise-canceling feature of this phone, but it's on the box.
1,These did not work for us, but to be fair I think the printer may have been clogged.  For that reason, I did not request a refund.
1,These do not roll like they are supposed to and the tip has already snapped off of two of them with normal use!!!
1,Already reviewed but since then the shredder has started to get louder each use. Probably going to blow-apart or quit after warranty is out. Figures.	I keep getting this item to review. Stop sending me this item to review.
1,Sent back due to it seems like I was continually sliding forward.
1,Both units updated the firmware as soon as internet connected, this causes the Wifi to disconnect each time it powers down,	ended up using with USB only and will toss when the toners gone.	Can not recommend for current computers
1,Disappointing. Sappy. The lyrics are like love letters to wives or girlfriends or whoever the hell they have. One semi decent song about walking in each others shoes just feels like a throw in. This album lacks depth and made me nauseous. I don't know why they named the album Bookmarks. They should have named it Love Letters or Sappy Love Songs From The Pathetic Pits.
1,It shows the color cartridge is empty so printer will not print
1,I have used replacement cartridges from several sources in the past. Never been disappointed until this time. I installed the cartridge and it printed  sheet before it stopped. I had to manually remove the sheet. I thought it might have been a one time event so I tried again. same result. Was it the printer or the cartridge? Replaced the cartirdge with different manufacturers' and it printed just fine.		So ther you have it.  sheet and then a jam. I will not buy another to see if it was just a bad one. It was a bad one.
1,I should have sent it back, but just didn't want to mess with the return. It did not work. tried different cartridges and still would not write. looks okay though, red is pretty. but it needs to work to be a pen. I had bought Sheaffer before and was pleased. not this time...
1,The labels will work but the  the whole package was put into my mail box and bent	I don't blame the sender I blame usps
1,After seeing the product I did not like how the rings did not open in the middle. If you were to put paper in there and take/add one to the end or middle, you need to take everything out. Poor design. I would return this if I didn't have to pay $8 to ship it back to them
1,Colors are pale - like an ending cartridge or mixed with water.	Cartridges are NOT communicating with printer - so there is no indication of how much.	Every time turning printer on - it prints a test page... more waste on inc...	Not worth a penny.	Threw them out.
1,I am returning this item - it is very flimsy and will not be good for anything that one cares about - brought to work to showcase students work and ruined their work
1,Works well, but overpriced!	Skipjack, Palatka Florida
1,Like many other people, I received this chair without the ring or the extra lift which is why I wanted this chair. It is useless to me without the extra lift or foot ring. Very much false advertising for this item as it clearly states that it comes with it. It would have been a decent item had it been what was advertised.
1,I have now tried two Panasonic DECT systems (this one and their Bluetooth compatible model) and the AT&T DECT system to which Consumer Reports gives their top rating.  But all three of the DECT systems I tried suffer from a crippling problem that, if you read reviews of other DECT systems on Amazon and elsewhere,  happens to a significant percentage of DECT users.		That problem is: these phones drop calls.  Drop them often.  Drop them no matter how close or far you are to the base.  Drop them more frequently and thus more frustratingly than the first cell phones used to do.		It's hard to see a common thread among those for whom DECT does not work.  Some have no wireless routers,  others do.  Some have multiple handsets,  others have just one or two.  Some have large homes,  others have studio apartments.  Some use VOIP systems,  others are plugging directly into land lines.		The DECT system has been the norm in Europe for a few years now-  but the frequency used by DECT phones here in the US is slightly different.  Maybe that is the source of the problem.		In any event,  I would strongly recommend that if you are going to give DECT a try you only buy from a vendor that has an easy (and cost-free) return policy if it does not work out for you.
1,I had the same problem as another reviewer. I packed a dozen moving boxes yesterday and this morning all the tape is lifting off. So I have to get more tape and re-tape them all. Poor product. Does not work as stated.
1,This product was packaged so horribly the contents did not fit correctly.  This item is priced way too high for the poor quality.
1,The product description calls these cartridges as compatible, but they certainly are not good.  Color streaks, smearing, blobs of toner is what you can expect.  Do not buy unless you want to have loose toner dusting all over the working parts of your printer.  Over a week after removing these cartridges toner dust is still making a mess on the working parts.
1,I should have listened to all of the reviews that said this product does not work on all mail.  I decided to try it anyway and will say that it did not work for most of my mail.  When I first received it, I excitingly tried it on a bunch of mail and receipts.  The instructions that came with the stamp says not to use it multiple times in the same spot.  The reason is that it ends up covering the words like using a permanent felt pen, and you can see the words through the ink.  However, only being able to roll ink over the words once does not work either.  It does work on some receipts better than mail.  I found out that it is easier to just spray rubbing alcohol on receipts, as the ink just disappears or becomes just an ink blot.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work well on mail.  So, I think I will go back to researching good shredders for my mail.
1,Nice, but not what I wanted.  Fat.  Bulky. Appears to have a foam padding under the leather that is very wimpy, but bulks-up the checkbook way too much.  I'll bet that fat foam pounds out quickly, and then I'll be left with a loosely upholstered floppy checkbook.  If cushy, soft and bulky is what you like, this is for you.  It's definitely not for me.
1,Terrible printing quality, DO NOT BUY
1,The Setup CD that came with my CX6400 Epson Stylus printer has become lost (HELP!).  I've gone to the web site to download current drivers (at the recommendation of the Epson CS response to my dilemma), but can't seem to find the "original CD" driver information at all!  I get pieces.  Since this is an "all in one" printer, I would like the original software, not pieces (one driver for printer, another for the scanner--that doesn't work).  If you are searching for a printer, stick with the tried and true HP printers.  I've never had so much trouble with an HP printer.  (And if you have the original setup CD for the CX6400 printer, I'd like to BUY it!)  THANKS!
1,AVOID LD CARTRIDGES. I cannot remember which site i purchased LD cartridges from. It is the HP 60. The ink ran out in no time - and it was the XL! I print on fast draft. Must have been half full.
1,When I bought this thing I was assured it was a trial. Since two years were cheaper, I went with that. I was also told that I wouldn't be charged for the 30 day trial. Next day, a year of service hit my bank. The phone didn't work at all in my area, so I tried to get customer service on the phone for return - nada. No answer, no voicemail, nothing. I returned the thing as instructed on the invoice, and after a suitable amount of time to get the return, they charged me $89 and I couldn't get it back no matter what. What a bunch of crooks.
1,1) Absolutely TERRIBLE SPEAKERPHONE feedback.  It amplifies my voice, then with a ms delay replays my own voice back through the speakerphone.  The effect is a terrible echo of my own voice that is so distracting it makes phone unusable.  Monkeying with volume, distance, phone carrier etc does not work.  This is simply a SOFTWARE bug.  Trying to get past Panasonic tech support with this problem is impossible		2) Everyone says on other end voice volume is low, especially on speakerphone		3) Older version 62xx has excellent speakerphone, but does not have bluetooth		Back it goes, get out old one
1,Returned..wrong size..my fault...many thanks..
1,This item is advertised as a "magnetic white board". The only thing magnetic about it is the fact that the writing surface is steel. It would not even think about sticking to my refrigerator. I had to go to ebay to order magnets. I ordered very strong magnets and then glued them to the white board so that it would actually stick our fridge. I glued these magnets on because they stuck poorly to the steel alloy used on this white board. These same magnets snap very firmly into place on my fridge. Not only is it not magnetic, it is made of some alloy that is only partially steel. I am sure that this saved the manufacturer a few pennies on each one.
1,Not so great.  One worked good another didn't.  Printer didn't register cartridge as being installed.
1,Initially when I got this printer, I was very happy with it.  I used it only for printing from my computer, not pictures, though.  I don't think it does very nice photos.  Also, the scanner isn't fantastic for photos, either.  That's fine, it's not why I got it.		However, 6 months later, and I feel like I am constantly fighting with this thing and the ink.  I have to run nozzle checks and cleanings on a weekly basis which is a waste of ink.  Right now it just won't print black.  Last week it was blue.  I alway use Epson ink, never used anything else.  It is just very frustrating when you spend so much on the ink and have to waste it like this.  I cannot recommend this printer.
1,I bought it locally and returned it the next day.  I  couldn't get the wireless function to work at all.  I tried a number of ways, no success.	When I tried to print addressed envelopes, I couldn't do it.  Tech support at the store told me I need Word.  I don't have it.	I have used HP printers for many years and never had any problems.  Maybe they are getting too complex for me.
1,I originally reviewed this product as "Great" because when it first arrived and was hooked up, it was working fine.  A few weeks into owning it though, it kept dropping offline. Also, anytime I was talking to someone who also had VOIP, the call was garbled and would drop, usually bouncing this device offline too.  I read everything i could find on the device and continued to recycle, reboot, unplug and replug, etc. and it became a daily job.  My home phone was never operational unless i rebooted this device every day, sometimes more than once a day. After I missed several calls I wrote to Amazon for a refund.  They explained that after 30 days it was up to the seller, so I contacted the seller several weeks back explaining and asking for a replacement as this was supposed to be warrantied for a year.  I received a response a few days later telling me they had sent an update of the firmware to my device and I should recycle it and the router, which i did.  It seemed to work---for a few days, and then went back to the dropping. I wrote again to the seller for a replacement and was sent a set of instructions outside of my tech ability.  I wrote back pretty much demanding a replacement of refund, and I am still waiting for a response. I would never recommend buying this to anyone.
1,staple cartridge jammed for no apparent reason. no way to release it or clear issue. swingline doesn't have schematic. i always used their recommended staples. poor design. would not buy again
1,Didnt work.  returned it.
1,awful.. nothing sticks to it and they aren't very sticky to have posters etc stick to walls like everyone said ..waste of money
1,"Came on time and was a good product."  That is what I wrote last year when this first came.  As of today, it has started getting stuck every time if I insert paper on the one end, even only two sheets at a time.  I have not abused this shredder, but I have used it and kept it oiled.  I have opened it up to find the problem, but do not see one.  Either do not buy this shredder, or puchase the 4-year warranty.
1,This is supposed to be an OEM Brother Toner Cartridge, but I don't think it is. The quality of the output is terrible--very light and faded. I had purchased it for my father-in-law's printer who lives quite far from me. After he installed it and started printing he was very unhappy with the quality of the print. I asked him to take out the cartridge and shake or rotate it a few times. He did this, but still the printing is very poor quality. It has now been over a month, so we cannot even return it, so we are stuck.
1,I have used well over 10 printers over the course of 12 years. This one by far is the worst one ever! We wanted a cheap one the kids could use to print off their things. From day one, it shuts down and I need to unplug it just to get it to work. It grabs 5-10 sheets at one time. I almost through the printer out the window several times. Save yourself the frustration and buy another one. People who like this printer must be in the minority.
1,I bought this for my office. Opened t	From the box item was broken. I would not recommend anyone this item
1,Doesn't peel off easily. Too much work, I don't use it at all.
1,Advertised wrong :(
1,I couldn't get the watercolor pen to work, but I had others. I originally gave this product a good review but  I have changed my mind. This product is not for beginners. Using it in all the ways it can be used I found it challenging.  The grippers they sold separately  were useless.  I had a color break while using it and the rest of the stick is stuck in there.  I want my money back.
1,run out too fast
1,Would be a nice mat if it didn't have perminant wrinkles... tried ironing them out, but they are all still there from being folded in the packaging four times or so.
1,Installed 08/01/15. Printed less pages than paper held in printer, mostly black.  Printer began "warning" me low ink Jan 2016.  Printer must use up more ink running it's start up and update diagnostics than other printers.  This is the last Brother printer I'll buy.
1,I just have to post here again. This printer is the most exasperating piece of equipment I have ever owned.  I am now just finishing up my second print head cleaning on a reasonably fresh set of Epson black carts. My old HP wide format was never this bad. I never had to clean a head on it. This Epson has been printing fine (since the last cleaning not to long ago) and then I just put 10 photos through it and the last three were striped in the (reasonably new) black. Time to clean the heads!! First cleaning and now the cyan, yellow and magenta heads are showing up as clogged!!! Clean it again and the black is still showing as clogged but at least the others are seemingly OK. Now a third cleaning!?!? GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Forget those that tell you that letting the printer sit clogs them, I have been using it right along, every day, and it still clogs! It wouldn't be such a big deal but these Epsons fly though the ink (and it isn't cheap @ 60 bucks a set +/-) and cleaning is nothing but a huge ink waster. Take my advice and see if you can do without one of these. Look at other brands, shop around. Don't be fooled by the cheap price of entry, they WILL get you on ink. If you have to pay a little more for another wide format printer, keep in mind you probably won't have to flush a lot of it cleaning print heads. Oh, I almost forgot, I had an internal piece fall of of it awhile back. Some rollers from somewhere. Seems to work fine without them however but having pieces fall off a low mileage printer is a little disconcerting.		Update:  I originally posted this on February 23rd and today it February 27th. Since then I have had ONE day of normal printing with the weekend of no work and then this morning. I am now cleaning the heads on this printer once again!! This time all the heads are clogged with the recent black carts and a fresh (installed a few minutes ago) magenta cart clogged. So you be the judge. I think I need MY head cleaned to keep owning this pile.		Update 2: It is now March 2nd and I am, once again, cleaning the heads . The black is printing with stripes in it. Wasting more ink. Let me say that I've printing out maybe 20 or 25sheets since the 27th. Not exactly torturous duty.		Update 3: It is now March 27th and I'm cleaning the heads Once again. It looks like my last update (around the 14th of March) isn't here. I wonder what's up with that? Somewhere around the 14th just after I installed some fresh black carts, I had to clean them because they were striping. This is maddening.		Update 4: May 2012, more clogging with fresh or almost new cartridges. More "cleaning" which wastes ink. And more often than not, it takes two cleanings to fix the problem. This thing replaced my HP large format. It died after many years of use. I cleaned the heads on that maybe a handful of times in all the years I owned it. This thing needs to be cleaned at least a couple of times a month and with the cost of ink (over 60 bucks, it uses two blacks), and the low yield of pages (don't believe Epson's figures, not even close), "cleaning" is a huge waste not to mention the spoiled printouts and wasted time. The page yield is so low and cleaning so frequent that I think I can buy another printer and it will pay for itself in a very short time in savings. Somebody else mentioned a HP 7000 Wide Format machine. I'm looking into that.		Update 5: June 14th. More clogging. Black is clogged. Wasted a nice piece of expensive presentation paper. Cleaning the heads. Cleaning didn't completely fix the problem according to the Nozzle Check app. Going to roll with it to get the printing done.
1,The time tracker function works fine. The issue is that tracker won't turn off when I no longer need to use it. It just sucks up 2 AA batteries over the course of a week, and then requires replacement of the batteries. Even with rechargeable batteries, this is a nuisance (the battery panel must be removed by phillips screwdriver).
1,Instead of receiving polychromo pencils as advertised, I received Faber Castell Albrecht durer watercolor pencils. Nice pencils, but NOT polychromos so the description for these is misleading.
1,Nice inks
1,This chair mat has a big dent in it.  Since it's not cracked, they won't honor the warranty. I can no longer position my chair where it needs to be, it just rolls into the trough, leaving me unable to sit comfortably.  Waste of money
1,I ordered these specifically for the colors and this was the only pack that showed yellow, yet no yellow was in the packet...false advertisement.
1,Shortest review I've probably ever written: Installed software, hooked up scanner, and attempted to use.  Couldn't save or view scans.  Received error message.  No help on Fujitsu website.  None, nada, niente, zip, zero, zilch.  Attempted fixes mentioned on other websites.  Still wouldn't work.  This piece-of-crap scanner is going to be returned tomorrow.
1,Currently working on my master's degree, I ordered these in the past, they were great, I really needed these this time around I ordered them, and although my printer is listed as one of the ones this item is compatible with, they did not even almost fit. A waste of my time
1,World's Best Pencil?  NOT ANY MORE!  I used to swear by the quality of these pencils.  They truly were the best.  But something's happened!  This year (2012), I purchased both the yellow-barreled and the black-barreled HB pencils at the usual PREMIUM price and got ordinary to poor quality pencils!  I checked the newer Ticonderoga pencils against an older one and a Staples brand pencil.  The newer Ticonderoga were no better than the Staples.  In fact, the new black-barreled pencil was not even as good as the Staples.  The newer pencils aren't as soft or as dark as they use to be.  They drag on the paper instead of moving smoothly.  I was going to attach a photo of the comparison I made but regrettably, I don't know how.  My advice: Don't pay the higher price for pencils that are no better than a "supermarket brand".
1,I have never had any good luck with re-manufactured ink...  It has killed a few printers and I no longer consider using it.
1,Package came open and you could see ink on the rollerball so it looks like it has been written with.
1,Item purchased supposedly authentic, but the printer said it can't recognize it. Yet ran to staples bought another and it worked . Quite suspicious and I think ill go direct to Epson front now on, and Epson direct is actually cheaper
1,arrived damaged and its not your typical calculator for subtraction you have to example 4+4- = 0 and cant do 4-4=0 . I returned it
1,Save your money, the quality is not good, the leads fell apart and sharpening was a joke, could not get a point, the lead kept falling out.
1,I will never buy these labels again.  They printed fine the first time I used them, but this time, the edges are curled really bad.  My printer grabbed about 6 sheets at one time.		I contacted the seller and they graciously refunded the price of the labels.
1,I  found this glue dot by accidentally clicking a link in a photographer's blog. Since it was highly recommended in the article, I gave it a try.	The product itself is of good quality, but it does not work the way as described in the article.
1,I bought this to replace a similar lap desk from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Furinno/dp/B004QXIFCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Furinno</a>&nbsp;that I have used for more than 3 years. I bought it mainly because this desk included a mouse pad option which was badly missing from the Furinno model. I didn't care about the fans but I didn't mind them being there.		The desk is fairly light - as light as the more expensive Furinno desk		Because it was so cheaply made, two of its adjustment buttons got stuck halfway, leaving this completely useless. There is no way that I can see to fix this issue. I have only had it since November 2015 so it's been only 4 months of very light use. I liked the desk but I wish it was better quality and lasted longer.		Save your money! If you like the idea, find something similar that is better quality so it lasts longer.
1,When I opened the package ink had lashed out everywhere! Waste of time and money!
1,I bought this paper so I could doodle on it with neon gel pens.  When I tried the gel ink on it, it basically just absorbed leaving almost no color on the page.  It's hard to doodle or Zen when you can't see it.
