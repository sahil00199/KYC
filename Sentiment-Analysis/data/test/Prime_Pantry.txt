0,This Grape G2 is the preferred variety of my kids, who use it to rehydrate during their afterschool sport activities. Because I didn't allow sugary drinks when they were younger, they now really dislike the full-calorie Gatorade products. G2 is lighter, easier to drink, and still provides the great hydration they need. They have both also tried the G2 Fruit Punch but hated the stronger flavor. This smaller-sized bottle gets finished off before it starts to get warm, perfect!		Yes, pure water is a wonderfully refreshing option as well, but sometimes you really need something with a just a little pop of flavor.

0,This can of nuts draws more people, I can be alone and next thing I know is the can is empty.  Love them!
0,The Parmesan in this recipe is a little strong formy taste but my family still enjoyed it.  Shake 'n Bake always produces great products that keep chicken or pork moist and tender while baking.

0,You always need Kleenex on hand.  A must have!
0,Very smooth flavor.  Will purchase again.
0,I hadn't seen the Neosporin bandaids in stores and pleased to find them on Amazon.  I have used several to cover cuts and scratches and feel good that the wound is dressed with something.  I would recommend them to anyone.
0,It's Oreo cookies, they're yummy - what more can one say?
0,Smells amazing! This is definitely on my repeat order list.

0,These chips didn't last 5 minutes! Bought them for a party and they were gone so fast. Great with salsa! yum yum
0,AAA
0,Love These very sour
0,Crunchy, full of flavor and slightly spicy.  They are addicting but are a healthier choice than regular chips.
0,You cannot beat Charmin for quality toilet paper. I usually go with the Soft or Sensitive, as the Strong one sometimes clogs the system. The TP itself is excellent quality, just make sure your toilets can handle it or rotate the rolls with other versions as to not overwhelm the plumbing. This is also a good product for quickly cleaning up hair on the bathroom floor. You can wet this and not have it fall apart.
0,In my perspective Downy is the gold standard for fabric softener. It works great by reducing static and softening laundry with no to minimal residue. Additionally, the scent it leaves is fantastic! My clothes still smell awesome a week after laundering.
0,My grandson loves these !  I now have a couple boxes on hand for when he comes for a visit. Very tasty too.
0,Works well, smells great, and you can feel good about your affect on the environment.  Even works to easily remove everything from hair product to wheel grease without drying your skin.
0,Makes a great quick meal.
0,These are helpful for getting rid of weird streaky build up stuff that shows up on the inside of my windshield since I live in an area where humidity is monstrous.  These help clear things up from the inside when needed in a pinch.

0,Mascara makes my puny lashes long.  Separates them but not the 80's spider kind.  Just enough to make them look fabulous! !
0,Really love these crackers, low in calories. A great treat. I think I have 3 boxes in my pantry right now.  Will continue to buy as long as they are available. I tried these from a local store, and was delighted to see them in the Prime Pantry.

0,I loved this crust.  I made it in  a big  13" round pizza pan then put my toppings on it.  It was delicious.  I don't like the red pizza sauce so I spread light olive oil on it.  I used pineapple a big can drained and crispt bacon crumbled up.  I shared it with a friend and she said it was the best pizza she had evwr tasted.  I will be ordering more.
0,Just took our pit bull, Whitney, to the vet after an altercation with a raccoon. The vet said Whitney's teeth look great! Whitney gets these Greenie dental chews as a snack quite regularly. So, they are working for Whitney! She gobbles them up and is always delighted to have them as a snack.
0,These are so delectable that I can never just stop eating.  I think I'm addicted to these.
0,Chex Cereal, Gluten Free, Cinnamon, 12.1 Ounce (343g), by Chex.	This variety of Rice Chex cereal contains about 50 % Rice Chex and 50 % Rice Chex coated with cinnamon and molasses. This cereal is good, and makes an interesting snack as well, but like a lot of processed foods, it contains more salt and sugar than what is good for us, with a medium-high amount 180mg of Sodium (Salt) and a medium amount 8g of Sugars. The Fructose and the Canola Oil don't get my votes either. I hate the taste of Canola Oil, and it makes me nauseous. Thankfully, the amount used in this product is minimal. I guess my body is trying to tell me something, -that Canola Oil is not good for me. I get the same feeling after eating anything containing synthetic sugars like aspartame and saccharin. Better living through chemistry? I don't think so. Please, keep it natural and digestible.

0,Brought these to the office. Went quick. Must have been good!
0,Best cheese puffs ever!
0,Aren't these good?  I love being able to have them shipped to me.  I've braved it twice now and have no complains.  When it's cold, they get smothered in chili.  When it's warm, I go for cheese and salsa.

0,Very good, my new favorite.
0,nice product
0,Everyone once in a while we enjoy brownies. These are awesome. Chocolatey, not super cakey or oily. I'll be looking for these next time we want a brownie fix.
0,Entire family uses this soap after long days outdoors, sweaty days, after sports, the pool/beach, etc. Smells clean and cleanse very well. A bit drying to the skin but hey put lotion or oil on after you shower and dry yourself!
0,I love this tea and I was happy to find it in a box with so many teabags. I do prefer the older no string attached version but it's the flavor that counts right?
0,Cute designs and colors. Comes in several different Mickey Mouse prints. And band-aids come in two sizes. The whole family including adults love these!
0,Quality product for those who need this type of protection.
0,Always a welcome product about 3:00 AM when you have heartburn.
0,Being type 2 Diabetic is certainly no fun. Finding delicious snacks that are okay to eat with this condition is very difficult. Glucerna has never failed to delight me! I do find the shakes a bit too sweet but can override that by adding some 1% milk. These little mini-snacks, & they ARE mini, are delicious! I'll be buying these again!
0,Very nice. I was pleased.
0,Good popovers.  Use a pan with large cups for best result.
0,Like the saying goes, "variety is the spice of life" and I feel the same way about my coffee.  Brooklyn Beans Breakfast Variety Pack is my favorite coffee to order.  Depending on what I am having for breakfast, I can pick a K-Cup that compliments my food.  I don't eat the same thing everyday for breakfast so why would I want to drink the same coffee?.  I love that the variety package gives me the option of choosing the right coffee for each meal.  Later in the day, when I want something different, the Brooklyn beans flavored coffees hit the spot.  You can't really go wrong buying the variety box, there is a coffee flavor for each meal and mood!

0,I'm of an age now. 45 to be exact. Since I devoted my life to being the perfect parent and donated the use of my uterus to my ungrateful son I now have issues when I do jumping jacks, giggle and cough. I sometimes have issues just running or turning quickly. Bladders suck when you're "of an age" and sneeze or yell at said ungrateful son, or the dog. Or sometimes when you bend over to get something out of the fridge, or stretch to scrape the windshield in the cold.		I'll just get to the point. I pee a little, quite often. So often that I now have to wear Poise pads. They work. I no longer walk around wondering if my friends and co workers can see a little wet spot. Know what I mean? So if you're "of an age" and you too donated the use of your uterus to ungrateful children and you occasionally like to giggle, do jumping jacks or sneeze without embarassment, purchase these pads. Trust me, you'll love them.
0,Good product.

0,I've experienced a noticeable difference vs. not using heat protectant spray when curling my straight hair. I have less split ends because of this. Give it a minute to sink into your hair before you use your iron/straightener/dryer. I've used it on both dry and wet hair and same results
0,good tasting
0,Sticky, stay for the most part where placed. Do what they are intended for.
0,Obessed. I bought one small can (stupid me) and I ate this entire can for dinner one night.

0,I love this shampoo!  I used to use the Wen products, and although I had no issues with hair loss and the impending legal mess going on, I stopped using it when all that was announced and started to become public.  I liked the no sulfate shampoo.  Wen did not lather and I (think) I read it was due to the lack of laurel sulfate on Wen's website, but this has no sulfates and it does lather.  Not sure of other sulfate free shampoos lather or not but I will update this review if I try other sulfate-free shampoo and can report back.  (I have purchased another type in a smaller bottle for airline travel but not tried it yet.)  I know that I love this shampoo and will continue to use it!
0,Wow! I lined the dish with vanilla wafers and poured the cheesecake filling over it. Very good.
0,Very satisfied.

0,quick easy no mess the only complaint I would have is wished it made more taste excellant
0,Love the ease of using these and of course the scent it leaves behind. I gave a canister to my daughter to try and now she is a happy customer too
0,It's interesting to see Old Spice making a comeback.  I was hesitant on the product but it works well.  I'll pick it up again as it works for me.
0,Love this cereal
0,Not bad, for the price.  I like coffee, and, while this is not my favorite, it does the job.  Wakes me up, tastes reasonably good...what more can I say?  Prefer MH French Roast, when available.

0,While I normally prefer the full sodium soups, I really do like this Progresso minestrone soup as well (though I sneak in a bit more salt or I mix it with another can of a full sodium soup).  Like most canned soups, I primarily use this as a "base" soup and then add a little leftover rice or pasta and any fresh or frozen vegetables (like spinach) I have laying around.  This soup is pretty expensive in NYC supermarkets when not on sale ($3/can), so at less than $1.25 a can here and delivery right to my door, this is a bargain!		------UPDATE: 8-28-13-------		You gotta love Amazon.  When I received this order, they accidentally sent me the regular (full sodium, higher fat) version of this soup, which I did not want.  Although Amazon does not allow returns on supermarket food items, they issued me a credit right away. Way to go Amazon!
0,I actually use this for body wash!
0,Excellent product and shipping.
0,This Dawn product is the most gentle yet powerful dish and household soap I've used, and I've tried them all.  I won't use anything else.  I do a lot of cooking, baking and cleaning and all other products caused my hands to dry out, crack & bleed.  I switched to THIS Dawn and have never had another problem with dry hands.  It smells good too!
0,A quality product delivered promptly.
0,Great for a light crunchy snack.
0,It seems that some of the newer dishwashers require this for a nice clean result.  It helps wash away spots that otherwise may remain on your dishes.  I never used it in my old dishwasher, but the newer efficient models seem to need this to get a good result.
0,Over the last 36 years, we have tried several brands of instant mashed potatoes, this is the Best I've tried. You can really taste the potato and butter flavor combo, this convenient cup is ready in a jiffy, and you can enjoy with a variety of meals. My daughter enjoys it with a piece of chicken, and I've enjoyed it with pork chops. There are many occasions where I'm pressed for time, and these cups come in very handy. We love mashed potatoes, and these have now become our favorite instant. My grocery store does Not sell these cups, or this brand, so I'm grateful we ordered here on Amazon & will continue to do so, when we run out. Delicious, quick-and-easy, and good price. Highly recommended!

0,Soap has a nice rich lather. Does not dry your skin out or leave you skin sticky feeling. Has a nice smell but is not overwhelming. Works great for sensitive skin persons.
0,Excellent cream, is absorbed very fast and the skin feels fresh, the smell is not as strong is perfect.
0,YUM! Easy to make with great results. We put dried cranberries in these last time and it was phenomenal.
0,i like the size of the shampoo
0,when it comes to taking care of the trash, it just makes sense to pay the extra cost to buy a  product that can handle whatever you need to toss. Nothing worse than taking out stinky garbage and the paper thin cheapo bag splits open.
0,Buying these again.
0,This rubbed sage has an intense fresh fragrance and sweet flavor that will inspire you to toss out that stale bottle of sage hiding out in the back of the cabinet.  Just a few shakes is enough for most dishes.		The label states that it is certified USDA organic.		The plastic jar came with a safety seal and has dual shake and pour flip-lids on the  threaded cap.  It is a little over 4 in. tall and holds 0.4 oz. or 11 g.  The jar that I received has a best by date about seventeen months from receipt.
0,This sea salt & Pepper is one of my favorite flavors of skinny pop.  I order all of them but this one is one of my favorite flavors.

0,This is a must-have for casserole cooks.  It is sturdy and truly even cheese won't stick to it.  I've been using it for years since it was first on the market, even at higher prices.  As soon as I open the last one in stock, I reorder.

0,I use this non-stick foil in my toaster oven, probably 4-5 times a week.  It works like a charm.  The food does not stick, and there is, virtually, nothing to clean up.  I don't use it for baking cookies-for that I use parchment paper. But for cooking or reheating food for lunch or dinner, this product is wonderful!
0,Smells really good. Lots of compliments when I clean houses.

0,Several different Mother Earth products were purchased for "survival food" in case of an emergency for my grown children and their families.  Everyone should have a stash in the event of an emergency.  These are light weight (all moisture is out) and easy to store.  I suggest in the coolest place in your house for longer life.
0,Store quality, great value delivered to your door - thank you amazon!

0,i am so happy i found pure leaf iced tea on amazon.  its not super expensive in stores as they usually have 4 for 5 deals. but this takes the cake.  also this is the best bottled tea i've personally ever had in my life.  its refreshing without tasting like chemicals and actually tastes like tea.  the honey green tea is my absolute favorite.  would buy again and again again
0,Would recommend
0,It is a bit too stiff for my liking but is a good brand of pasta. Package says boil 12 minutes but I have to do 15-20 to make it soft enough.

0,My family loves jerky and we are constantly buying jumbo bags from Costco, but what that means is that we need to create snack bags for the kids when they are on the go. When I found these pre-made snack size bags it was great! They are the perfect amount for a quick protein snack and already in a nice sized bag for packing in lunches, sports gear, backpacks, or daypacks. The kids love them and are the first thing to go in my home. I have not been able to find them in my local store, so ordering from Amazon Pantry makes things simple. Place your order online, and within days it is delivered to your doorstep!
0,Perfect for work lunch or a quick dinner.

0,This little alligator--may he rest in peace--lasted about twenty-four hours in my house		Much as their ancestors must have enjoyed chasing down and eviscerating large prey animals, my dogs seem to enjoy pulling the stuffing out of every toy they receive. Once Mr. Alligator's (very white and fluffy!!) stuffing was removed to my dogs' satisfaction, they continued to enjoy the 'skin,' and will likely get many, many more days of fun from it before tearing off individual limbs.		Stuffed toys are a special, rarely-given treat for my dogs, and this experience is on par with every other stuffed animal my crew has given, so I'm not even a little dissatisfied.
0,I am addicted to these Cheerios. I have been eating them every day for the past month, and have lost 6 pounds..Go figure, good for you, and helps you loose weight. This is the best of desert and breakfast. The taste is wonderful!

0,grainy but i love that.  if you cook it longer than the 3 min the grains will soften, i add milk when cooking, vanilla, cinnamon and a touch of honey.  delicious.
0,I'm not a vegetarian but take them for lunch at work. They're easy to microwave with practice -- if needed, just reduce the time or the power level to avoid boil over.		If you have a tolerance for meatless food, these are really quite tasty. Adding olives or parmesan is even better. Have a side of crackers or string cheese and you're set with a filling lunch. These are healthy, convenient, different, AND no animals died in their manufacture.
0,Yummy granola bars!

0,Bought this as I needed some "clear" liquids in preparation for a medical procedure and didn't want to get bored... I will say that this drink "smelled" grapey... but tasted less so.  It is still... not sparkly... and a little sweet.  I probably won't order again... but it is interesting for a change..

0,This ginger ale is spicier than most. I think it's a little pricey for just four cans. I don't buy it often, but it's a nice treat as a mixer -- it's not super sweet.

0,Item was just as expected at a great price. Received in excellent condition, and just as promised. What a convenience.
0,My hair is finely textured but I have lots of it  shoulder length and curly. It is somewhat fragile, tangles easily and is prone to breakage so anything that helps keep it strong and resilient is welcome but using conditioners daily weighs it down.		A couple of months ago a product I tried left my hair feeling dry as straw. I used 3 minute miracle and it helped restore balance and softness. Once a week I completely cover my hair with a thick coat of one of their miracle conditioning products, and leave it on for a minimum of ten minutes up to thirty to give it a deep conditioning. My hair is a bit flatter on that day, but the rest of the week it feels soft and is shiny and bouncy.		This is a good basic product and although I have tried more expensive conditioners I always seem to return to 3minute miracle. The only negative for me is the fragrance. The product description notes citrus fruits as scent components but what I smell is generically sweet and fruity  not citrus, which Id like. The fragrance, while not a favorite, dissipates quickly. I would prefer no scent, but I overlook this because the product is economical and it works well.
0,Great Price and does the trick
0,great for dusting and then you can throw it away
0,don't even need sugar in my coffee when I use this

0,Since I live in the Kansas City area, let me just say that this is good, not great, Barbecue Sauce. You cannot beat JackStack Barbecue Sauce, but this is a close second!
0,good
0,Love these!
0,Wow this is easily the best tea I ever drank and further more it isn't 5 star,.. I LIED>  its 1000 stars!
0,So far, so good.
0,Got this to try crumbling a few on my morning oatmeal and cereals. Tasty, fresh. Planters quality expected, and delivered.
0,Great taste, high in protein, low in sugar.  And for a god price.
0,Nice scent. Durable product.
0,Delish!
0,I was looking for something nutty with a little heat. These are perfect. They aren't so spicy that you need to find water right away, but they have a nice chili taste kick after you chew the nuts and chocolate. Right now I have three different varieties of Kind bars in my pantry. Most of them are the nut variety, and my kids eat more then I do, but these Dark chocolate chili bars are tucked away in the back so no one can find them. Now they do have 200 calories and 15 grams of fat. So if you are worried about calories/fat intake they may not be for you. I eat 1 a week when I am on the go. I don't overindulge.
0,What can you say about campbells tomato soup.  Mmmmmgood!  Especially with drilled cheese sandwiches.
0,Makes me bounce to use this
0,amazing flavor
0,love it, nice product
0,Great snack!
0,According to consumer reports, rice grown in California has the lowest levels of arsenic. My family eats a lot of rice and the more I read about arsenic levels in rice the more concerned I became and I was happy to find out that there is rice available from areas that are fairly reliable when it comes to low arsenic levels. The Lundberg white basmati rice has always been very tasty and aromatic and we will continue to enjoy it as always!  I also love the resealable bag.
0,great product, wonderful smell too
0,Good
0,It tasted delicious, the only minor quibble for me was using the included recipe resulted in a pudding that was a little more liquidly then I would have liked; cutting back slightly worked just fine. The Tapioca itself was excellent.
0,I don't know what it is about these nuts but they are ridiculously addicting. When we open these cans, we blow through them in a couple days (family of 4) with as much self-control as we can muster. It is a good mix without any "cheap" nuts. Tastes incredible!		We have signed up for subscribe and save shipping and it ends up costing about half as much as if we purchased it at our local grocery store. It even is cheaper per ounce than Costco's deluxe mixed nut mix, and the Planters mix tastes so much better.
0,NOTHING quenches my thirst like S.Pellegrino!
0,It's pretty good. A  few pieces have been really really crunchy and kinda hurt LOL but it is delicious.

0,Once I went on a hiking and camping vacation.  I had no shower, no toilet, no change of clothing, and no comfortable place to sleep.  Sometimes I struggled to breathe because of the altitude.  When I returned to civilization my first priority was to drink a diet coke.
0,Consistently my favourite brand of pasta.
0,I love this body wash. Alba Botanica is one of my favorite brands for shampoo, conditioner and body wash. This large bottle will last me ages but I will order it again in the future. It leaves my skin soft and smells pleasant. I highly recommend this brand for skin and hair care items.
0,As far as my family is concerned, Justin's is the gold standard for almond butter...we try other brands but keep coming back to this one. It does have sugar in it, 6g. per two tablespoons, but to me that's not excessive, and the taste is just sweet enough, not too sugary. Some people prefer an almond butter with a fair amount of oil, but I like it fairly dry, not oily, and Justin's is perfect. Amazon has it at a nice reasonable price too, cheaper than Target or Wegman's.
0,Great price great delivery great product
0,Great item Fast ship
0,my 15 pound chihuahua mix loves them . They are a little large for her, but this is the smallest size greenies come in. My dog eats it all up and often wants more. Helps keep her breath fresh too.
0,Healthy and tasty!
0,Ordered these hoping they would make a prettier garnish for pies and cakes than the regular shredded coconut. These flakes are dime sized and more and make a very lovely garnish, important as I operate an bakery. Customers love them and so do I.
0,great
0,surprisingly good cheeto type chips
0,Sticky, stay for the most part where placed. Do what they are intended for.
0,Above Average
0,I'm actually using this to add to my dogs dry food --- they love it of course.  It is flavorful - as only a small sure does the trick.
0,The dishes are very clean with FInish dish powder.
0,Very good taste and texture for the most part. The thing we all hate about jerky is that "stringy" texture that feels like you can't chew it and won't digest it. This brand has SOME of that but so do most brands I've tried. Overall this is a good taste and good quality.
0,Great quality; great price.

0,I'm sure whatever is in the center is terrible for my health, but lordie lordie is it delicious.
0,Great thing spaghetti noodles, not quite what I would call angle hair spaghetti, BUT it works with standard tomato sauce.
0,The best almond milk, a very good value.
0,good
0,Love this type of rice. It goes great with so many dishes. It doesn't cook up sticky or anything like that. It's very versatile.
0,Love it. Use this an a Cat spray every few days and everytime I change the litter.
0,Just what I needed.
0,nice blend of garlic.  not pasty - pretty close to fresh

0,this is one of my wife's favorite diet food,
0,FINALLY, Ranch is my favorite flavor of chip. I never knew these existed until i saw them on here. I ordered them and not i have found my ultimate ranch flavored chip. These are not over bearing in flavor like some other ones and that is hard for me to say as i LOVE ranch. These ones though are done perfect. You can tell they are Fritos with that iconic fritos flavor but the ranch steps it up. I will be getting these again as soon as i need to.
0,Great scent. Much better than the cheap stuff!
0,Good!
0,Delicious and fast. And huge box, too!
0,My favorite plastic wrap!
0,When I first encountered benzalkonium chloride, I was really skeptical. I've heard rumors of people going blind as an ingredient found in eye contact lens solutions, causing nasal irritations when used as a nasal spray, or causing rashes in skin conditioners like body lotion. I did further research, and turns out that the .1% of benzalkonium chloride (used in this Babyganics hand sanitizer) is beyond the safety standards from the National Library of Medicine which is .499% (anything beyond .5% is considered toxic for your skin, but not enough to kill someone).		So, I gave it a try, and here are my impressions. I am happy that this doesn't contain an overwhelming and annoying alcohol smell (Yay! it's alcohol free). It's incredibly soft on my hands, unlike Germ X and Purell, they severely dry out my hands (even if they added aloe vera extract). The foam reduces the amount of waste compared to the liquid pumps. It does the same job as those chemically derived hand sanitizers. With this extremely mild and moisturizing hand sanitizer, I know it's meant for babies, but I highly recommend it for people with sensitive skin. I use it at work and school, because it is that wonderful.
0,My husband tells me to buy these again. He gives them 2 thumbs up.
0,Good product has been good in the past expect the same in the future
0,Tastes Great!

0,Hey, what can I say, its gatorade at a good price!
0,What can I say but, yum!
0,This was a Christmas Stocking stuffer; however, I will be adding it to my AMAZON Pantry list for future toiletry closet stocking.  No fuss.  No muss.  Came right to the door without hassling with holiday crowds.  The convenience is unparalleled!
0,These were good cashews not super salty. The price was good for this size
0,Great Breakfast Food

0,Our go-to for occasional heartburn or reflux from certain foods. Works very well and taste is not bad at all
0,Pleased with seller and quality of product. Thank you
0,Great product, great price, great vendor = Great DEAL!  Thanks!
0,Best cookies in the world! Honestly do I even need to review these? Everyone should know Pepperidge farm has got it going on. Milanos are the best choice for a fine snack with mid afternoon tea. And honestly any other time you're hungry between meals.
0,Good stuff.
0,Love this shape! Holds sauce well and nice shape. And seems difficult to over or under cook- great for me as I constantly have my hands full with 2 little ones. :)
0,You can't go wrong with a box of Kleenex!
0,Smaller bottles but great soap as always. Great for the ducks and for me !
0,Item as described and shipped in a timely manner, thank you.
0,Nom nom nom.
0,Nice flavor.  I like a taste of cranberry in the morning.
0,Great highlighters! the colors are really vibrant, and I've been using them daily for about a month now with no issues. The chisel tip helps with thin/think lines, and making really precise markings. It may sound weird, but I actually get compliments on these in my college courses.
0,This was quite delicious; the seasoning was perfect.  I wonder, though, if my packet was typical.  I got mostly flavorful liquid with a little bit of lentil at the bottom.  I would describe it as a very thin lentil soup with Indian flavors.  I don't see how you could possibly get 2 servings out of this.  It was a very light meal, even for 1 person.
0,About as good as instant mash potatoes can reasonably be.  Cheese flavor isn't overpowering like in others.  Super simple and easy to make as a side.
0,Pretty much the same as the chicken and dumplings but a nice soup for a chilly day meal.
0,Great crackers.
0,kids luv it
0,Delicious! Nutty and really great!

0,Great merchandise and service.

0,These taste Great!!
0,I liked the mint flavor. When you want an Oreo that has really good flavoring to the filling this is the cookie flavor to go to. It's minty fresh and it tastes good with the chocolate cookie.

0,Good
0,This is my favorite scent. It smells SO good and it makes my skin very soft and silky. I love it.
0,Arm & Hammer is the only detergent I use. It is inexpensive, yet has no problems getting out grass and blood stains as well as leaving a pleasant scent even in cold water without having to use more than indicated. What more can you ask from a detergent?		I've actually ordered this product twice. The first time the bottle came with "The Gripper" (basically shrink wrap plastic) around the cap to prevent it from coming off during shipping, while the second time it came in a sealed plastic bag, so don't be afraid of getting detergent over your pantry order.
0,Just what we hoped for...
0,Love the smell so relaxing in my room, smells great went Febreze crazy in my room

0,King Arthur has the absolutely best GF products I have tried. They are a bit expensive, but when purchased through Amazon Pantry, the cost is much more reasonable.
0,Box was partially opened when it arrived. These are decent.
0,Just like the rye bits in Gardetto's Mix, but better. Good sized bag, exactly as described.
0,If there was a perfect chocolate chip cookie that was not homemade...this would be it.
0,The flavors are wonderful and the aroma divine. The taste of these k-cups is sublime. Brew yourself a cup of  cappuccino at home and enjoy this great treat. Love the assortment. My guests enjoy the variety too.
0,My son loves them. Just wish you carried unfrosted ones too.
0,tastes good and easy to make
0,Prefer another brand but this was adequate at a better price
0,Great for the price
0,very small can but tasty nonetheless
0,Joy is a good dishwashing liquid for the price.  Priced lower than most does not mean that it will not get your dishes clean.  A couple of drops into hot water, and you will have a lot of soap suds.  Dishes, etc. get clean with no spots or food residue.  The lemon scent also smells good.  Highly recommended for the job it does, and the price.
0,I am reviewing the online grocery experience with Amazon. It was really neat experience to be online buying food! Its easy to use- kinda fun, but the really good thing is it matches coupons for you! That in itself, makes the experience awesome.
0,I love these low sodium black beans. They taste great and we don't notice the lack of sodium. Works great for our low sodium diet which in some cases lacks in flavor. We use these in casseroles and over rice.
0,Love it
0,Interesting
0,BEST STUFF EVER
0,good tasting nut bar from Kind.
0,very good product.  I use it now in my morning protein shake instead of soy milk
0,Imodium is our go to for these issues and this form is excellent for taking along.
0,Another item not carried in my local store or walmart. Curse of small town living. I get trees and air, but not some of the treats like this. The baked and popped mix is a great variety and while I purchased it for me and the regular stuff for the husband and kids, they ended up depleting this before their own. :(	Next time, going to have to hide the thing. lol		Recommended if you like the baked varieties and some popcorn to boot.
0,Refreshing with a hint of sweetness. I prefer it cool while my brother thinks it is more flavorful warm. A must-have treat for a warm summer day.
0,Works well in the washing machine and it should.
0,love it
0,Super yummy and convenient
0,Makes your clothes SMELL SO GOOD!
0,One of my favorites!
0,could use more lemon
0,This a product I buy all the time.
0,Truly as good as it gets.  I've been a fan of the Organic Smucker's, Laura Scudder's and Adam's, but this is as rich tasting, while being creamier than the rest.  It's just like grinding up your own, without the headache.
0,love the smell and works great. <My second bottle now>
0,very effective in removing makeup
0,great!
0,Great taste		I would rate these up there with Vitamin Water Zero.

0,I bought these because they're much cheaper than the prices I've found at local stores. A light and refreshing sweet tea with a hint of lemon! Not too sweet and not too lemony: a perfect balance!
0,Good tasting frosting and spreads easy, seems to be a household favorite. I have to hide it in the back of the cabinet or it is mysteriously missing when I need to frost a cake or cupcakes. I usually find it empty in the trash can with a spoon inside the container..hmm
0,Great Price
0,These work on so many things and don't scratch, love them

0,We love it, and trust Crystal Light instead of some of the other companies.
0,Very tasty potatoes.  Excellent product and a good price.  If you have not tried "prime pantry" yet, you are missing out.  Not only is there a great selection of products, it actually saves you money by keeping you focused on your shopping list and prioritizing the items.  One of the biggest expenses for my family is buying as many item on impulse as we do our shopping list.  Prime pantry removes the temptation of buying items, buy color, packing, or other sales gimmicks.  It also has a very cool calculator that tells you exactly how much room is left in your pantry box, and makes excellent suggestions for what to fill it with.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  How can you beat grocery shopping from home on your computer?
0,I have a family member who is bed ridden and wears diapers. When they leak through, I find myself having to wash clothing as well as bedding and trying to get the urine smell out of the clothing.  Baking soda takes the smell right out and it can be used in the HE washers.  This was a great bargain because it is a bulk item.
0,So yummy in my coffee
0,Love these!! Gluten free and yummy.
0,love
0,There are now many "big name Brands" selling gluten free soups, and they do cost less.  However, Amy's GF soups remain my favorite.  Not only are they gluten free; they are lower in sodium and delicious.  I especially  like the lentil/vegetable, but enjoy all of Amy's soups.  I've learned from experience that sometimes things claim to GF but still cause problems, so I stick with what tastes good and never gives me a "Gluten attack."
0,Great product.
0,Good
0,I bake a lot of bread and Glad Cling Wrap is perfect for wrapping loaves of bread in before freezing.  I used to use just foil to wrap the loaves and then put them in a plastic freezer bag but sometimes some of the loaves got a little bit dry.  I was told to try wrapping them in a plastic wrap, then foil and then placed in a freezer bag and I have not a had a problem since then.  I also experimented with different plastic wraps and Glad Cling Wrap is the best there is to use for freezing loaves of homemade bread.  It sticks well and keeps the loaves nice and dry.  It's almost baking time and this roll will last me all winter long.
0,Still don't like the chemical smell these emit. I tried other scents, but found the same thing. Next time I will go back to using the containers.	Regardless, Damp Rid does a good job.
0,Quite simply, for the money you can't beat this.  There a some cheaper options, but they don't taste good.  This Folgers is a great combination of taste and price.
0,Great taste and time saver
0,This has a bit more of a bite to it than I was expecting. The Clementine variety tastes more like what I was expecting a natural orange soda to taste like.
0,great value and great taste
0,I love these band-aids. They are great when you have a blister due to a new shoe or something like that. Very cushioning. I can no longer find these at the store, so I am so happy that they are still sold on Amazon.
0,Thick, sturdy, reusable.  Best paper towels.
0,Cans arrived early, not dented, with an adequate shelf date. They are a little more crisp than other brands, but tasty and would be good in a salad. (I like to eat them plain.  I usually give them a quick cold water rinse first.)  I found no sharp thorn ends nor inedible parts in this first can of 4 total.  The price is the same or slightly less than my local grocery stores.
0,I like the natural flavor of applesauce so this was perfect for me.
0,love this- was unsure at first however I find it does not splash nearly as much! :) I do not want to stop getting the liquid bleach too however this is great for washing those things which need bleach. I also think it is safer than the liquid.
0,Perfect to bathe your dog - in my case Great Dane. I never worry about getting it in his eyes and he smells great for days.
0,this is the best.
0,only thing is the bag is so small!  tastes delicious!
0,I like it taste good to me
0,One of the few boxed side dishes that delivers what the box says.
0,who doesn't love rice krispies treats
0,i bought this to use in my bread machine and it works well. i keep a little mason jar filled in the fridge wrapped in foil out of the light and the rest in the freezer until needed.
0,Very good soup
0,keep this in your house for emergencies.  You will be glad you did, if you have children who don't like to take pills.  The flavor is very pitiable and my daughter has no problem with it.
0,Good cleaner, nice smell
0,If you like unsweet tea this is the best on the market.  It is brewed directly from the leaf.  Read the story on the package.  If you want Diet Tea you can always add an artificial sweetner to it.  I love this brand of tea.
0,Earl Grey Tea is just great. So happy to have made this purchase.
0,Great tasting tea. It is NOT flavored (like the Dandelion Tea produced by Republic of Tea that has a very strong vanilla flavor). On the other hand, I detect none of the bitterness that is typical of dandelion products. Now, whether this tea will work as a purgative (what dandelion products are typically sought out for) I cannot say. I purchase my teas for the flavor, not for the effects. This tea tastes smooth and is full of flavor.
0,Really Good!
0,Flexible & do not rip skin off.
0,good value
0,very good
0,These are great for personal care, but too small. Must have been men who made the size, because ladies have a bit more area to clean.
0,Great price
0,if you've ever used these then you know they work great
0,Great price to be delivered to my door!
0,I get this for my husband. He loves it. Will buy again.

0,Love these! So easy to use and quick to grab for a low maintenance working mom of two! I have been using them for years.
0,These cookies were fresh and quite tasty!
0,LOVE THIS STUFF!! Taste like dry roasted peanuts when reconstituted, not sugary at all. I've put it in smoothies, sandwiches, no-bake coconut balls, and oatmeal. Can't wait to try more things!
0,Solid, don't spill, easy to reuse	These are the containers I will always chose
0,My Husband loves them
0,OMG, gone in less that 2 hours!  Addictive and yummy!
0,To tell you the truth, I ordered the wrong bags, but these are working out just fine. They are extremely strong and hold quite a bit and doesn't tear when you push the garbage down into them. All in all I'm happy with the product. Arrived quickly.
0,as expected
0,nice to have on hand, good mix.
0,Tastes great.

0,Everything arrived promptly it works great!  Love the smell!
0,I love this wrap. Seals good and easy to use!
0,Great product but higher price than at grocery store.
0,Good. If you like things a little bit less tart, just add a couple of squirts of catch-up to it.
0,These are really cheerful party baking cups that should definitely be used for cupcakes but there are lots of times that this is exactly the right size for many things  especially after school snacks.  Sometimes the children will put peanuts in one or pretzels or goldfish and they always look so festive.  It is exactly the right portion for an after school or bedtime snack.
0,Just tried this on a steak and it was so good!! I was a little hesitant at first, but It has just enough heat to balance out the sweetness. I put the rub on and let the steaks sit out for 15 minutes before popping them under the broiler and they came out perfectly. Next up is the cowboy rub!
0,This is the best invention. Don't like using old dental floss because of having to put your fingers in your mouth.  Then these came along (use to be Reach) and we love them!  I use this 2x a day. My Dentist loves seeing me. They've told me they wish all their patients had teeth like mine.  Easy Job for them.  I could never be without this.  Always floss your teeth!
0,These taste sooo good! Hard to believe they are actually good for you as they taste like they aren't :)
0,I like girl scout thin mints, and I like granola bars. I can't find these in store anymore so was happy to find them here on Amazon. The mint flavor isn't as intense as it is in the girl scout cookies, but it's still really tasty. I enjoyed these so much I decided they were good enough to share with a friend that lives out of state. She didn't even know that they made this variety. Obviously she loved the minty, sweet, and chewiness of the granola bar. I would have liked there to be some of the crunchy cookie part perhaps on the bottom half of the granola. I think that was the only thing really missing, was that crunch.
0,This sea salt grinder is a great value.  It includes much more than the standard size.  The packaging is of high quality, but the grain selector is a bit complicated to figure out, using a continuous turn knob on the top of the shaker vs. the slide selector on the side.  The grain size ranges from coarse to fine, but is difficult to sift out completely.
0,Son likes it
0,This was part of a care package. The recipients were very pleased!
0,Delicious on burrito bowls!
0,Love all the minerals in this salt. Hard to use a small amount of it. Risotto was great. A salt with a flavor! What a find.
0,Was delicious.
0,NICE BRUSHES
0,I love the McCafe decaf coffee. Not bitter. Has a smooth taste
0,Some are too tart for my taste & the caffeine is hard on me.  Wanted fruit drink not green tea or the caffeine...
0,My Mother said these remind her of her grandmother's molasses cookies. These are soft and the molasses flavor is strong. They are good with milk, coffee, and even herbal tea!
0,better than spaghetti
0,This product is soooo good and tasty and a wonderful foil for favorite dips and spreads.  They're good all by themselves or with aforementioned dips & spreads.  You'll be inspired to create tasty treats to use with them!
0,Arrived safe and sound, tastes good.
0,Nature Valley has great-tasting bars and they only keep improving.  I was recommended this flavor by a friend and they taste great.  They were cheaper on Amazon than where my friend said he was buying them locally.
0,Awesome for cleaning dishes. Last a month in my kitchen and does not stink.
0,Not quite as peanut buttery as I was hoping, but they are pretty good when you want a snack that's filling.

0,This is the only sloppy joe that my family has ever enjoyed.  It is very flavorful.
0,Thin but very absorbent. I did have a little issue with them not absorbing quick enough if the flow was too much too fast but I have found that to be true with most pads. These are very long so I found them uncomfortable to use for my morning exercises especially when riding the bike. They were great for night, when shopping, or a regular work day.
0,Perfecto
0,It's Shake 'n Bake, enough said. Always does the job.
0,It's toothpaste. Good value.

0,I use thes bags for all sorts of things. The thicker plastic in the freezer bag holds up very well and can be washed and re-used multiple times! The 2 gallon sizeis perfect for 8X11 paper - so Iuse  as my dustfree, seal in all the small notes for my taxes each year!  The new seal  is easy to open and re-seal withthe larger  tab opening
0,This works great. I never heard of non-stick foil but once I tried it I will never use regular foil again for cooking. I re-heated pizza on it and the cheese melted down. Usually that would stick to the foil and be impossible to get off. It just slid right off the foil so I could enjoy every bite. I love this product!
0,Leaves dishes nice and clean, no streaks or film.
0,Twinings has always made exceptional tea, and the Peppermint K-cups are no exception.  Each cup comes out perfectly peperminty and cool/hot.  It is great to make and then freeze for ice cubes that you can add to anything!
0,Exactly what I wanted.
0,Ziploc bags used to have a very "plastic" odor, making me not want to put food inside of it. That seems to be a thing of the past. Love these for freezing soup.
0,Easy satisfying addition to an on-the-move meal
0,These are great! They taste like skittles and work really well. I keep them in my purse all the time for when I don't have water and can't take regular alka seltzer!
0,Great Product
0,These baggies remind me of the good-old days for lunch sandwiches. To try them out, I placed my lunch sandwich in the bag, tied the bag with the twist tie, placed it in my lunch sack, and took it to work with me.  It all worked out fine, My first tendency was to throw out the bag and start over the next day with a new one. Can you reuse them? I have found that cleaning and reusing a plastic take-out container does work well.		A use that I found for the baggies is the storage of partially-used vegetables, like tomatoes, in the refrigerator, instead of using plastic wrap. I like them for that.
0,I really like these.  I buy several different sizes to use on leftovers.

0,My 4-year old doesn't like any of the minty toothpastes. He loves the flavor of this one, which keeps him brushing longer. I love that we found a kids toothpaste he loves that isn't full of neon dyes.

0,Good stuff, cinnamon and Life Multi-grain cereal, which I hear is better for you. Excellent price, hard to go wrong here.
0,Great will order again
0,These were so much nicer than the other gauze pads we were using.
0,Other than the boxes being left on my porch soaking wet when the delivery person knew it was supposed to rain & the boxes falling apart & all paper packaged products inside being soaked as well this product is what is to be expected. Cans arrived dented as well.
0,this stuff works so well it's crazy. We had a spare bedroom in the last house that we rented from and we never ever went in there. Well, little did we know, our dogs were using it as a huge pee pad! We started to move everything last month and walked in this room to find pee stains everywhere! We were SO mad at our dogs and disgusted with the carpet. I bought this stuff and followed the directions to the tee! Shake container, spread on soiled area, brush with clean soft bristle brush, let dry for 20 minutes, vacuum with empty vacuum cleaner. All of the stains were gone! The carpet looks clean as ever and we got our security deposit back. I did have to vacuum numerous times because it looked like white spots over the areas that I cleaned. It all eventually came up and the carpet was all one color again. I have no idea how long those stains were in the carpet and they all came out easily.
0,My kids adore this pasta! It's extremely simple to make...just add milk, butter, and water and boil. A super easy go to meal!
0,I love using lots of spices to flavor up anything I am cooking and this onion powder is great. It has a great flavor that goes with anything and everything I put it on. It's the perfect flavor of onion. Very happy.
0,Gluten level is wonderful for making that special homemade bread.
0,great value
0,good
0,Product is as described - Very good
0,I don't do well with artificial vanilla which is in almost everything. This cake mix comes out more like chocolate bread. I even tried to make it moister and fluffier by adding a little leavening and oil. No such luck.		So with 3 boxes and a lot of tries I would say I like that it has nothing artificial. But it isn't going to win you any prizes taste wise against Pillsbury. And it could be much darker.
0,Took this camping. It tastes good and while its list of ingredients might elicit objections, I found it to be an appreciated addition to my camping trip. I prefer liquid to powder.
0,This is tied for the best GF chocolate cake of all time (with pure pantry's chocolate cake, which is much harder to find). This cake is super moist, not sickly sweet like many other brands (some brands try to make up for lack of gluten with extra sugar????). It is truly, absolutely, utterly delicious. I make it gluten and dairy free. And everybody loves it. Most people are surprised it's GF!
0,Excellent no matter what hair type. This is a very high quality conditioner that makes shampoo unnecessary. Good size for a good value.
0,I have used Tide most of my life, I grew up with it. A household must.
0,Love all of their products
0,I don't know how much I paid for this buuuut I hope it wasn't much lol I thought I ordered boxes of tissue.
0,As expected
0,I ordered this out of curiosity more than anything else. And I am honestly amazed at the difference between this, the "real" Japanese Kikkoman sauce and the standard American made grocery store version. This is MUCH mellower, less salty, much richer and much more flavorful. This actually tastes of soy instead of salt. I'm VERY impressed! Bet I don't use the American version again. AND the price for this through Amazon is lower than the price for the US version in the grocery store, at least where I live.		I'm officially a convert. If you have doubts, get it anyway. You won't be disappointed.
0,We have a one of these soft brownies nearly everyday.  Satisfies the cravings for chocolate without those nasty ingredients.
0,We love the majority of the Bai5 drinks and this Brasilia Blueberry is no exception. Wonderfully tasty, refreshing, light but flavorful. No funky aftertastes, it tastes like juice to us.		We also like their carbonated versions.

0,My dog loves these, he isn't super picky but doesn't usually have the dry treats as his favorite treat of choice. i decided to try these for him because the price was right and the ingredients were on the better side when it comes to treats. I am happy to report that he likes these just as much as the soft treats i usually get for him.  They are also the perfect size for medium to small dogs.
0,Shipping was fast, arrived undamaged, and overall a great purchase! highly recommended.
0,Nice value for the price.
0,Enjoy most all of Progresso's soups.
0,Personally, I don't eat this. I buy it because my 4 grandchildren who are with us every weekend love it and I mean love it. Want a clean plate of real food, just say this is dessert; want their room clean and organized and this is the snack--Magic.
0,Good
0,Great for allergies, girlfriend uses it religiously in allergy season
0,Barilla is a regular purchase for us. It's not just good with tomato sauce, but firm and solid enough to stand up to our family's choices of  chopped chicken, melted cheddar, mushroom soup, veggie chunks, etc. We also love angel hair by this same company, but when we create our own "kitchen sink" (casseruola) one pot meals, it's got to be Barilla penne!
0,Man I love these things. I am a big fan of any type of nuts, boiled peanuts, roasted, but these have a great salt and vinegar taste. Really good. I have already bought 3 more cans since the first one. The cans are small though. I thought it would be a reg size can of peanuts ya buy from the store. My fault for not reading the label size though, still very good peanuts. Worth it.
0,as expected
0,Great price & good in my Nutra Blasts.

0,Does work!
0,We have tried the store brands and we always come back to Ocean Spray when we want a quality cranberry sauce at our table. The product is always consistent with the previous can. Just a  little chilling and it is ready to serve. Great product which is very tasty.
0,Healthy yummy.
0,Very satisfactory

0,So yummy
0,TRESemme hair conditioner is awesome. Leaves my hair soft with no build up or residue afterwards. This one smells nice too. Just as good as Dove or even some salon brands. Great value for the benefits and quality provided. I have been using TRESemme for years now because of that. I purchased this product at full price for personal use.
0,I am the odd one in the family that likes crispy cookies, so these aren't my style, but my bf loves them, so I order them for him.
0,The amount of calories you get out of this is great for the price and sodium level. Just add some meats or veggies and you've  got yourself a complete meal. Also easy and quick to prepare.
0,Great value.
0,Very sweet, thus too much added  sugar

0,Love Mrs. Meyers products! Especially lemon scented ones! Cleans well and easy on hands!
0,works well.. always solves my allergy problem... always take as directed per instructions.
0,Great product and family loves it.	Just like if you bought in the store, but cheaper to your door and perfect condition!!!		The packaging is always perfect on Amazon. The packages are easy identifiable and the best system in the world for buying anything.
0,Great soft fell and a lite smell of Vicks that seem to be just what is needed to help you feel better.

0,Awesome product, super quick shipping!
0,The best.
0,It is hard to find rice that actually has a taste, especially wholegrain. But this has a great flavor (nutty, it actually tastes like grain, a hint of smoky) and I love it.	The short grain rice has a stickier texture and it gets chewy when cooked; so it works better for puddings, pilaf, risotto-like dishes, etc. It won't work as salad rice, for example. It's also good simple, on the side, although some sauce helps with this drier and firmer texture.	I find that you need more water to cook it than the package says, almost 1.5x more. I cook it on the stove.
0,The only detergent I will ever use! Leaves everything sparkly clean!
0,My dog loves these
0,We got into baking our own bread some years ago and also make our own pizza, so we easily go through 10-12 teaspoons of yeast every week.  I used to buy a pound or more at the bulk food store,but it's a bit out of the way.  This is the same stuff as far as I can tell, perhaps just a bit less expensive.  We store the extra, well-wrapped, in the freezer until we need to refill our spring lid jar.
0,I like slim jims even though they are not that healthy for you.
0,We purchased all the unsweeted tea products from Amazon.  This tea is very good if you like the strong iced tea flavor.  I like them OK with ice.  It has just a tiny bit of bitterness that is natural to tea.  It is a very great quality.  If you like great tea in restaurants, you will likely love this one.  I chose 4 over 5 only because it is not the one I love best.  I like the lighter teas for daily drinking.
0,These are great to have for when you need to run out and want a cup to take along!  This is not meant to replace the reusable coffee go cups, but great for when you need one that is disposable!
0,YES	Eat with hummus, goat cheese, anything!	Delicious
0,Good.

0,My favorite hair care! Not too pricey, but leaves your hair salon quality. Very good product. It also smells amazing! I have hair past my hips, and always get comments on how healthy it looks. All thanks to this product! This particular one does amazing at repairing your hair after a particularly damaging style. Good amount for the price.
0,Used on the outside windows of our new fifth wheel . The rod reaches well and the windows sparkle with no streaks or film. No need to wipe to dry just follow directions . Wash off with hose then clean with the windex cleaning pad then just hose off to rinse and let dry. Nice product.
0,Ocean Spray has the best cranberry products.
0,very flavorful
0,This is my favorite coffee after going through umpteen different ones to get that ahhhh cup.  I need not look any further.

0,Cuts are rather like snowflakes...no two are the same. So why do we purchase boxes of adhesive bandages that are all the same size and shape? I find that the array of bandages in this box cover a much wider range of wounds and is, as a result, a more effective product.
0,delicious
0,This came as a life savor just at the right time. I had surgery last week, not a big procedure, but a heart surgery nonetheless. I couldn't shower for a few days, so I used these. They worked great! And oh they smell so nice! I have very sensitive skin and these didn't break me out :). I recommend these for everyone!
0,no refrigeration
0,Buying again !! Kids loved them !!
0,So good!
0,great product, great price with fast delivery. would recommend to anyone who asked.
0,Great flavor and easy to make!
0,I absolutely love these little boxes of rich dark chocolate almond milk as a nice treat. Tastes great and doesn't give any of the negative side effects of dairy for the lactose sensitive! These do contain quite a bit of sugar though so you might not want to drink one every day.
0,I don't know what this does but my mom always used it so I do too.

0,I have nausea for travel related issues.  Generally, it's just when riding on curvy/hilly roads but reading or looking below the horizon often will give me issues as well.  Most times, if I drive, I'm fine.  It's being a passenger when issues arise. When it happens, I feel horrible for about 24 hours.  I have used multiple products to avoid issues but nothing is more convenient than this little tube of magic to prevent car sickness.		On a trip to Napa with a group of couples, my college friend luckily had this in her purse she uses often for her son.  I hadn't anticipated any issues with driving/riding for this weekend event, but this was a lifesaver!  I've now purchased multiple bottles of this.  It's has 24 hours of effectiveness and doesn't cause drowsy symptoms.  I hope this product is never taken from the market!
0,These products are AMAZING!  They smell great and make my counters shine and clean better than anything that I have used!

0,LOVE THE SMALLER SIZE!!!!  I have bought this Dixie green white dinner plate for a long time but my grocery store never had the smaller size in that design.  I could get everything else.  So I am thrilled to find this plate, this design, this size!  Plates are quality and I use them every meal.  Great for microwaving to using as a 'tray' when I grab 2-3 to put under the food plate.  Though I would rather not rely so much on paper products, given age, health issues and no dishwasher  (except me)... these plates are a godsend :) !

0,Out of all the organic cereal my kids have tried, this is their favorite (or more like tolerable).  The older children say it tastes like the regular cinnamon cereal, but the younger children didn't want to have seconds.  Adults would find this better I think.
0,Four stars for freshness, but I prefer more salt. You will enjoy these if you love cashews.
0,Love this flavor!
0,Received as described and in a timely manner.  Like this item.

0,Great hand soap but the scent can be a bit overpowering. When Im cooking I have to wash my hands several times during the meal prep and the scent of this soap can get a little overpowering with each hand wash. Tone it down a little Meyers! Other than that, its a great hand soap that does not dry out your skin. Im curious to try other scents.
0,Part of a care package box. I might order this for myself at some point as well.
0,i didn't taste this flavor yet, but i trust it is great, just like the rest of Progresso's line... i'm saving it for the end of the world
0,I am addicted to this cracker, it's flavor and crunch

0,As Advertised
0,The only thing which would make it better would be to make it more concentrated so we'd pay less from not paying transportation costs on water.  I thought I was purchasing a larger bottle, so not such a bargain at Prime Pantry, but hey - you expect to pay for convenience.
0,This color safe bleach does a great job as advertised.	A great buy. Reasonably priced.

0,so addicting. cant stop eating them.  the crunch, sweetness and spicyness is crazy
0,luv this cereal

0,I use this coconut oil to moisturize my dry skin, especially bad in the winter.  I bruise very easily so I melt the coconut oil and add 1 oz of Pure Arnica and 1 oz of Lavender to the liquid. Both available on Amazon. You can buy an arnica and 'unknown ingredients' for much more than the cost of making your own, if you also tend to bruise.  My dermatologist recommended a product containing Arnica to help make bruises go away and I decided that I wanted to make my own.	I don't cook with it since I prefer grape seed oil or pure vegetable oil or EEVO for cooking or frying.  I don't care for the taste of coconut oil in my food but it's great as a moisturizer.	My daughter is a LMT (masseuse) and she uses this for massages.  A little goes a long way and as a body moisturizer it's absolutely unreplaceable.	Yes you can buy expensive face moisturizers but a touch of Coconut oil liquifies quickly on your fingers and is wonderful for your skin.  At 74 years of age, I prefer to use pure products-without parabins especially-I recommend this highly for use on both men and womens bodies during the winter, especially.
0,Has a nice scent and does what it is supposed to do.
0,The BEST oil to use and the price was great.
0,YUMMY and less sugar.
0,i am totally biased because i love curry!! .. this was pretty darn good considering it came in a pouch and took about 2 minutes to make!! .. will definately be buying more .. i actually didn't find it that hot - but that's just me.

0,I used to love the oral b tape floss but over the past year I've had nothing but problems with it.  The floss never fed correctly, I had to open and reposition it and it shredded like crazy.  Hence the hunt for a new floss.  I have arch wires from braces and trying to floss can be a real challenge.  I hate floss threaders so I wanted a floss I could thread between my teeth under the wire.  This floss does the job!  It's a bit more flexible but it can be twisted and made "stronger".  It glides easily and smoothly.  The only complaint I have is that it's so darned slippery that it's hard to get it to wrap around my fingers and stay put.  So.. in order to accomplish that I tend to use more than I probably did in the past.  All in all its a keeper and I'm quite pleased with the purchase
0,It' s salt....
0,Gave out at Halloween. Kids liked it.
0,I love this stuff. These throwback versions taste so much cleaner and more refreshing than the regular version made with high fructose corn syrup. When I was overseas I wondered why the same major soda brands tasted so much better over there. I was younger and didn't really pay attention to the ingredients. Now I see why they were better, they were made with real sugar.
0,good!
0,good stuff - great flavor
0,Works as described.
0,This is a go to dinner for us on a busy week night.  It is so easy to make.  You just heat up some meat, and make the skillet and tada done.  I have always been very impressed with the quality of velveeta but their skillets honestly are amazing flavor.  We have a family of 5 and we usually purchase 2 boxes for our family for dinner and no one leaves hungry.  This particular one would also be great as a cook ahead bring to work lunch you can put into a lunch container and heat up at work.  Honestly, it is amazing on the second and third day as well.		When I found out about the Prime Pantry I was very excited but skeptical.  I kept my price list out so that i had an idea of what things cost before i purchased it.  I was very impressed with the cost comparisons with most items being lower through amazon. I know a few cents doesn't mean a lot to everyone but honestly, I also love they have coupons!  So you can get coupons on items.  You do have to know your prices, or if convenience is worth money a few cents more on some items may be good for you!  I highly recommend Prime Pantry for grocery shopping, It took about a week for everything to come in but the wait was worth it.

0,If I had taken Benadryl sooner, I do believe that I would not be sick right now! I have allergies, sometimes so bad that my sneezing attacks have actually made my nose bleed. If you also have allergies, you can picture what I am talking about! We did a little gardening on my day off. The good news is that the garden looks nice, but within an hour or two of finishing, my sneezing was in full bloom. Soon, it became apparent that there was no relenting on this particular attack. In my defense, the reason I avoided taking the Benadryl is because of the drowsiness it causes. I knew I would not be able to drive and finish the endless chores I had to complete. The next day into the constant drip, drip, drip, the allergies bloomed into what had to be a cold, accompanied by a sore throat and headache. Finally, I took the Benadryl. It cleared up the sneezing and drips and gave me some now well-needed rest. If only I had taken this sooner, I would have been saved the extra sick time. Take my advice -- Benadryl Allergy has been around for years and it is a great product! Highly recommended -- even to myself!

0,Yum! I really miss good crackers having to be gluten free but these are a nice replacement. They do have a slick texture which is a bit odd but the taste is good and it pairs well with luncheon meat.

0,Makes me beautiful!
0,These are very good but their Mesquite flavor is their best.
0,My grandchildren love to bring these for their snack time in school.  They love to dip the stick in the cheese.  Sometimes they want to bring 2 because they like them so much.  I have to admit I love them too.  I like the portion control for all of us.
0,Finally an easy non-spill way to handle bleach!
0,Traditional Fritos crunch with a great flavor and no weird aftertaste.  Like many snacks of this kind, you'll want to keep napkins nearby because the powdery flavoring comes off and congeals on your fingers after a few minutes.
0,works great
0,My new fav
0,I love Meyer cleaning products.  This lemon scent is awesome.  It cleans very well, and leaves dishes squeaky clean.
0,My son loves it and he makes me order it every time hes out so it must be great
0,Great price with Prime Pantry!!
0,Perfect for what we use it for.
0,Daughter loves them
0,This soap has a fresh, green, slightly sweet scent that is so refreshing I find myself washing my hands more often then I need to :)  I would buy it again just for the scent.
0,Great sponges, and quite durable
0,GRAHAM CRACKER CRUSTS FOR CHEESE CAKE, THE BEST
0,Between having 5 kids and a house full of pets we go through a lot of spray on cleaners. This brand (resolve) is my brand of choice and I have been using it now for quite some time. I love that I can spray it on a stain (even ones that have completely dried) let it sit for a few minutes and then scrub (or blot) the stain away. As you are cleaning it it does turn a whitish shade but once it dries it goes back to your regular carpet color minus the stain. Will definitely continue buying this product in the future.
0,yum, yum, yum!  I love these when I'm craving something sweet or as a comfort food.  Honey Maid always seems to have a more cinnamon taste than other brands I've tried.
0,Great!
0,I use these things quite often. From cleaning the kitchen counters in our house, to cleaning the interior of my vehicle. I also take them to work with me. I work as a train conductor, and I'll take a few of these wipes and wipe down my desk, radio handset, etc. makes the work area much cleaner and I feel more organized. Since I started doing that a few years ago it seems as though I don't get sick as often as I used to.
0,I love this product, and others like it. I could make a meal out of one package...just add shrimp, chicken, or whatever type of "meat" you like. Woild recommend.
0,great!!

0,Granted I use an electric toothbrush most of the time, this is great for travel and really does massage my gums. My opinion, the best standard toothbrush my money can buy.
0,Great for my dad who has diabetes, tastes good and has a fraction of the carbs too
0,Our favorite.
0,The only deodorant I use. It works when nothing else does.
0,Always buying !! why do some other kind	if its working Great why mess with something	else !
0,Nice
0,I've tried many Luna flavors, but this is the only one I really like. I keep them on hand for rushed mornings, and I keep some in my car for rock slides and trees down - road blockages- in the rural mountains. LOVE THEM!
0,Trying to cut down on iced coffee, thought I would give this stuff a try. After drinking it for a week or so, it seems to have the same effect of coffee without the afternoon crash being such a jolt. Seems to be better for my tummy too, I'll probably keep alternating it with coffee.
0,awesome food product at a great price and delivered right to your door!

0,Great pasta. Cooks easy, tastes great.  Much better then store brand.
0,I was skeptical about these at first - I mean, do I really need a disposable product to clean my toilet?  As it turns out, I really like it!  No more disgusting brush with water pooling at the bottom.  The pad snaps on easily and gets extremely foamy, which seems good.  The toilet seemed very clean after using it.  My only wish is that you could dispose of it in the toilet (I tried, there's a reason they put the warning not to on the box).  ;)  Otherwise they are great and work really well!
0,Same product I buy in the supermarket
0,A must have, good stuff!
0,Best floss for me.  Use it all the time.
0,I've been a Smartfood popcorn addict for years. I absolutely love the white cheddar and usually buy the huge bags, but I'm trying to be a bit healthier and thought these might help with portion control. They certainly do that, I believe all the bags are between 70-80 calories depending on the flavor. These bags are definitely SMALL; I see a lot of reviewers complaining about that, but the size was what I expected based on the nutrition facts. They're great for kids, or people like me who are trying to keep their snacking under control.		I was surprised how much I loved the kettle corn, I went through those bags right away. That flavor has the fewest calories (70) and the least amount of saturated fat (but also has the most sugar by far, with 6g). The white cheddar is as-expected, definitely cheesy and delicious. I didn't try the butter flavor because my boyfriend ate those two, but he liked them.		My only complaint is just that I wish there was a more even mix of flavors. I'm sure the white cheddar is their most popular popcorn, but I wouldn't mind a few extra kettle corn bags in place of some of the white cheddar. Overall though, I recommend these.
0,good price and right to my doorstep
0,These are great! Spicy, but not too much, and they taste like pepperoni. I don't know what the others here are complaint about. It's like a Slim Jim, but pepperoni, and no nitrites to mess up your skin. My bag had 7 or 8 in it - they won't last long and I'll definitely buy again!
0,So yummy
0,Works really well
0,I know this is not rocket science here, but when you follow the directions to set your microwave to 4 minutes and wait for the popping to stop for two seconds, ya better stop cooking or the popcorn will burn. But it leaves many non popped kernels in the bottom of my popcorn bowl. It leaves you beside yourself, cook longer and get more, however burnt, popped popcorn. Your mileage may vary....
0,Really yummy, just like I've been to an Indian restaurant.

0,I like that the Clif Crunchy Peanut Butter bar is less sweet than several of their other bars and it also lives up to its name, tasting mainly of peanuts while also delivering some crunch and a little chewiness. Since it doesnt taste too sweet and the flavor is pretty subtle, this is the variety that I would be able to eat several times over a day of hiking or traveling without getting sick of them. Of the half-dozen Clif bars Ive tried, this one is the highest in protein and the lowest in saturated fat (half the sat. fat of the White Chocolate Macadamia bar). Aside from these differences in fat and protein, the different varieties of Clif bars deliver similar amounts of each nutrient, including vitamins.		Clif bars versus the competition: Overall, Im most likely to choose Clif or Luna bars (Luna are made by Clif) now if Im hiking or traveling or just want to stock up on some emergency office food. I started out with Nature Valley bars from Costco years ago, and although they don't taste bad they're not great nutritionally. Kind bars are tastier than I thought but their contribution to society and the planet is not as large as they make out. Larabars are the closest contender to Clif bars for me, both in terms of gold stars (taste, nutrition) and green stars (social and environmental impact).		Overall, I think the Clif Crunchy Peanut Butter bar deserves 5/5 gold stars for quality (taste, nutrition, value) and also 5/5 green stars for social and environmental impact (more on that below).		The packaging for the boxes is made from recycled paperboard. The wrappers, like most, are not biodegradable (Mule Bars in the UK are packaged in compostable wrappers  hopefully this will be adopted by US brands). You can, however, recycle your Clif wrappers (and other energy bar wrappers too) through Terracycle  see their website to get a free shipping label. 72% of the ingredients that they use are organic. All of their cocoa and palm oil is organic and/or certified by the Rainforest Alliance, whos standards are considered to be as good as Fair Trade certification.		They have offset the company carbon emissions going back to the company start by helping to build wind farms. They have targets for just reducing their own carbon footprint and also those of their suppliers  the goal is for half of their suppliers to be using at least 50% green energy by 2020. Solar power provides most of the electricity and hot water for their HQ, which is also certified LEED platinum; their small vehicle fleet runs on biodiesel; they have incentive programs to help employees use green transportation and green energy at home. They aim for 90% of waste diverted from landfill by the end of 2015. Theres a lot to read on the Clif website under Impact, and it leaves no doubt that the company is one of the better ones out there.
0,ThermaCare keeps reducing the size of these.  Barely big enough for my needs, but they do work well.

0,Still love the smell 35 years later but now I use it as a body wash, as I no longer use sulfates on my hair. The scent brings back all the memories of the loving home I have been fortunate to have.

0,A gallon of salsa! This is good-quality ready-made salsa. We are using it with eggs, chicken, chili. Made a great Tex-Mex lasagna with it instead of tomato sauce. Good price too!
0,Sweet and fruity.
0,RE-PURCHASE ABOUT 6 OR 7 TIMES
0,These are so good, but the homemade version is much better.  They are very skimpy with the peanut butter.  I would even know there's Peanut Butter in them if it was not labeled as so.
0,As expected
0,After I finally broke a decades-long diet soda habit, I changed to one mug of decaf green tea in the AM and herbal tea for the rest of the day. Every time I tried some other flavor, I returned to Cinnamon Apple Spice, so now I keep it on the shelf all the time. Tastes great hot and cold. If you let it steep long enough, it tastes like you already added sugar. You'll love the flavor plus the scent of apples and cinnamon in the kitchen.
0,Nice bulk size. Family has lots of dye and fragrance allergies so this works great. Great product.
0,Smells nice and works well.
0,Not many pieces in a pack, but these are very tasty.  They are sweet and tangy, and have a nice strawberry flavor.  They are not sticky or gooey, but have a good texture and are worth the purchase.
0,great taste and value
0,Quality Towels!
0,love it
0,I was hesitant about these bars at first!!  The first bite was not my favorite, but once you start eating it the taste becomes very palatable.  The apple pie flavor is by far my favorite.  It is filled with tons of protein and fills you up when you need a snack.
0,This is one of my favorite lotions. It absorbs quickly and feels good on my skin.
0,I really like this toothpaste.
0,They are so handy for a job I do not enjoy, they made it a breeze.

0,I love these crackers, but just make sure when you order them that you fill up a whole box . Otherwise in shipping things move around in cans can crush your crackers and then you can have a bad day . But Amazon did do me right and I will order more again but next time I will make sure it's a full box .
0,Been using this toothpaste for years and I haven't found any I like better.

0,We've loved this for years...but without the toasted almond. I can't wait to try it! If we love it, I'll update this review after we've tried it.
0,These mints work well. They're covered in a dusting of crystals which helps knock out bad breath quickly while the more solid inner core provides a more lasting effect. I do wish they were stronger though, Altoids are stronger, but they're not exactly weak like Tic Tacs.
0,Good but not great. I like the initial Starburst strawberry flavor but unfortunately the flavor doesn't last very long.		Oh, when I received my Prime Pantry box with this gum, it smelled like someone had put perfume in it. I discovered the smell was coming from the gum. It definitely has a strong sweet smell to it.		Finally, I don't like all the crappy ingredients in the gum (like BHT and colorings)... but it does taste good for a little while.		Overall 3.5 stars and rounding up to 4
0,Trying this out for this first time and loving it! I vow to use this seasoning on every piece of chicken I ever make in life, ever

1,Incredibly weak and when I use less water 5/6 ounces, the flavor is still pretty bad.
1,Very tasteless
1,These are not for me. They have a very pungent apple flavor to them. If the flavor wasn't so pungent they would be fine but the flavor is a little bit of an overkill.
1,Too fragile to survive Prime Pantry delivery intact.
1,No smell after you open it.
1,Too thin and tear really easy, won't buy again
1,I bought a better one on the supermarket
1,Cookies were broken, 95% of them
1,I don't have high standards for such things. I've eaten cold MRE's with ice forming on them and didn't complain. I've eaten ramen that had to sit in luke warm water. This is among the worse things I've consumed that were intended for human consumption.
1,I bought this to fill in on an Amazon Pantry order.  It was a most bought item so I thought I would try it.  I like cooking with artichokes and the price was right.  I tasted one out of the can and some of the outer leaves were still spiky on the ends....so I had to check each  one and most of them had to have some of the petals taken off.  The remaining pieces were good but it sure was a lot of work for canned artichokes.  I think in the future, I will spend more and save prep work time.
1,It was ok, not amazons fault. Less tuna in every can it seems.
1,Not what I expected. Menthol smell is overwhelming.

1,Might as well eat half a gram cracker.
1,I bought these at Trader Joe's after hearing all the hype about these, I'm sorry to say I hate this cereal! I put 2 biscuits in a bowl and added a little amount of milk TO THE SIDE like I read, and instantly the biscuits soaked up the milk and instantly became soggy.....it was the texture of wet toilet paper..IN MY MOUTH! So disgusting. The taste was nonexistent, there was no pleasant taste to be found, not even a slight sugar taste like I hoped. The only way this cereal can be saved is adding a bunch of things to it, but then what is the point? The texture ruins it. Never again.
1,made in 2012, not really fresh
1,Just me, but the coffee was not good!!
1,Mini wheats are usually quite good. This flavor was on sale and bought a bunch. I regret it. If you want something that barely has any flavor go and get this. Its like Pepto Bismol over grains. I thought it was just me until I saw someone else pour a bowl and try to eat it then immediately get up to dump the bowl. After the recall right after getting this we threw it all out. [...]
1,Not all that easy to prepare.
1,tasted stale, i don't know if i will be ordering from prime pantry again
1,Puffs Plus has been in my house for more years or decades than I can count.	Now, these tissues (besides being smaller) are a mere skeleton of the Good Ole Puffs. They are super and non absorbent.	I am certain all other tissue brands shrunk, but now I have to try some thing different.  I am very disappointed.
1,If you want something that barely has any flavor go and get this. A few years back I could taste the cinnamon and have a bit of background sweetness. This version is not it. I am giving up cereal. Gone are the days of actual flavor. I hate to pass this on to others but better off giving it to someone else than wasting it.
1,Tastes like dust
1,Tough to open
1,I found the sauce to be of a strange consistency and that it went well beyond tangy and deep into the realm of sour. I ate one of these and I don't think I will eat the rest.  These could have been great, the sausage is actually pretty good and the noodles come out just fine.  This sauce ruins the whole deal though. Don't recommend these.
1,These bandaids have no sticking power. They roll off and leave a sticky, flapping, fraying edge to annoy you.  Complete waste of money.  Get the Waterproof Tough Strips instead -they are made of a duct-tape type of fiber.
1,Everything in this box tasted like lightly seasoned cardboard
1,Stale
1,WERE ALL CRUSHED IN THE BAG
1,Very bland tasting. I won't buy again.
1,I was unable to tolerate odor of this product.
1,Smells like paint.
1,I use these for many different things including recipes, notes, and phone number cards.  When I choose to use an index card rather than paper, I do so because I want it to last and stand up to repeated handling.  These cards are the thinnest index cards I have ever purchased.  I've used Oxford brand index cards in the past and they were of a much higher quality.  These are nowhere near the thickness of cardstock.  They are thicker than construction paper but not what I expect out of an index card.		They are true to size and have easy to see, vibrant lines on one side.  I will use them but not for anything I need or expect to last.  They were an excellent price as I paid only 89 for a pack of 100.  But they are not really a good deal because the old saying "you get what you pay for" fully applies to these.
1,My favourite green beans are French cut or "julienne" style green beans so I have  no trouble with the product as such, however out  of the 8 cans I bout 5 were dented, not slightly either, Not crushed exactly but obviously dented. I was the last ones available so maybe I got the dented ones. Anyway. Not happy with that. Expiration date  is July 15, 2015. That's OK but I doubt the dented cans will last that long and still be good. Dunno, so I'll eat them sooner than later. Sorry this isn't a good report but the dented cans were really awful..and more that half the order. A big fat one star for this one.
1,Love the flavor but will not buy again because it is made with GMO products.
1,not too bad
1,These bags feel very very light and flimsy, I am having a very hard time trusting them. I find myself double bagging them for fear of them bursting open.	  I will never buy them again, they may be tough and sturdy but they sure don't FEEL like it.
1,Dry.
1,too small and been trick by it size seems big but very little tube of tooth paste	not so good to me the flavor is so so !!!
1,Taste very nasty and has a canned dog food texture. I will not buy this again!
1,The liquid globs together and a lot of it falls to the bottom of the shower when you try to lather. Smell is nice though.
1,I didn't like this ones. Not nice taste. With chessee maybe are ok. I won't buy this ones again.
1,Cloyingly sweet and not at all chewy. We are still on the search for the perfect on the go breakfast bar
1,Really not my cup of tea., It's very large (see comparison with my toothbrush ) but the plastic feeling surface is very uncomfortable. Regret purchasing, and one of the 2 packages was damaged when I got it. (2nd picture)
1,The filling is awful. I'll never buy it again. Didn't taste like Pizza at all, and the texture was like chalk.
1,I like the concept of these containers, but the reality is that they aren't of high enough quality that I would move away from using my glass containers with locking lids.  Unfortunately, the "locking" of the lids on these Reynolds containers is very slight.  There is no way you would want to put one of these in a bag with other things and run to work as I could easily see the lid coming off and your food ending up all over whatever else is in your bag.  The container itself is, as one would expect with a disposable item, fairly insubstantial.  Think of a "to go" container at a deli or restaurant that doesn't use plastic containers.  My main beef with these, though, is that the lids cannot be microwaved, a fact I didn't notice when ordering the product.  I understand that some people don't want to microwave plastic, even plastic that's supposedly safe to microwave, but for most foods having a cover while cooking in a microwave is a must unless you want to have to clean the microwave after every use.  I don't understand why Reynolds couldn't have made the lid such that it could have withstood microwaving a single time.		Really, the only use for these I see is giving some food to someone so that you don't have to worry about getting your container back.
1,I like bisquick better.
1,So thin and sticks to fingers trying to put on
1,"Taste" is purely in the mouth of the individual. I don't care for this tea and am frankly puzzled how it may be described as "sweet." BUT, thats only my personal opinion.
1,Tastes TERRIBLE !  sorry i have to say that on anything with the Hershey's brand !
1,I used this when I found myself running up against the clock and needed Mexican rice in a hurry! I didn't realize when I purchased it that it was a mixture of both rice and pasta, but I'm downrating it not for that, but because it tastes nothing like Mexican rice. It did nothing to enhance the flavor of my burritos and I won't be repurchasing this in the future, not even as a quick side dish.
1,I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the "big two" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard "bad things" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.		But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.		Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called "erythritol" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol "shouldn't" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it "supposedly" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.		If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the "bad" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.
1,Didn't work in stove.stunk up kitchen like melted plastic
1,I find this cereal too bland for my liking.
1,Way too think
1,This mac and cheese is absolutely terrible. The pasts is gluten free and they may have something to do with it. However the cheese flavoring ( made from real cheese ) is disgusting. Does not even come close to a cheese taste. I cant even describe what the taste was only that it was nothing like cheese, almost like chemicals. Also when i followed directions as on package some of the noodles stuck together and did not cook at all they were just a hard clump. Needless to say will not be buying these again
1,IN WHAT SICK TWISTED HELL WAS THIS ABOMINATION CREATED?!?! LARA has not ONE TIME tasted the flavor known as "cookie dough."  I've heard that this is not one of their better flavors but i will never find out. Was a truly disgusting experience and i will be asking my taste-buds for forgiveness.
1,Don't buy food from Amazon...way too expensive.
1,I bought this for my husband because he wanted to try a new toothpaste. We were both very surprised to find that it is spearmint flavored, which I hate. It isn't mentioned anywhere on the bottle or in the description. I think that I, along with most people, associate green with spearmint, so I assumed that the blue packaging meant that this was the minty flavor of most toothpastes. That was an incorrect assumption. It's also thin and runny and kind of soaks into your toothbrush, instead of sitting on top of it. The consistency grossed my husband out and I don't think he'll be using it again. The one thing we did like was that the shape of the container makes it easier to store than traditional tubes of toothpaste.
1,I don't care for the flavor of this cake. It has an anise or licorice like flavor. I won't buy it again.
1,Saunders 8.5" x 12" SlimMate Plastic Storage Clipboard, Letter Size, Pink (00835)		I purchased this based on other reviews, and I am extremely disappointed in the product.  The plastic is flimsy and the clipboard surface bends under writing pressure, and the sides don't come together well.  The clip is loose and slides around when I try to lift it to insert paper.  The clasp does not have a quality feel.  I don't expect this product to last very long.		I don't recommend this.
1,kinda looks and smells like dog food
1,I'm not sure I'd call this granola.  It's more like a flavored oatmeal.  And the flavor isn't very strong, which is good, since it's not very tasty.  I don't need to buy this again.
1,Not my favorite Oreo cookie taste...just stick to the regular.
1,If this is the future of Cottonelle and Prime Pantry, I won't be using either.	Nothing that should be termed 'Big Roll' here. These rolls are narrow and	wobble around annoyingly on the toilet paper holder. This product is	not up to previous standards for the K-C company and Cottonelle, and	will only cause unhappy customers like me to avoid this brand and Prime	Pantry.
1,I didn't like them but apparently my husband did...he only left one in the bag
1,Stale
1,Incredibly bitter!
1,Not good smell or product also broken lid bad cust serv.
1,You can definitely taste the sugar free in this. I only use a very little bit every now and then just to get my money's worth but the flavor is just so bitter and off you can never use too much without messing up whatever you're trying to make. I would never ever buy this without the sugar again.
1,Didn't work when I put black sweatpants with other dark colors.	I'm sure they help though, I order them and will continue to do so.
1,Does not stick to the inside of the refrigerator very well at all
1,gel  i don't like gel
1,I didn't check to see if this had artificial flavors or colors -- it unfortunately does. Seriously ? Oatmeal (from Quaker no less) -- pretty simple. Dried apples -- pretty simple. Why do they need to add artificial flavor. I've completely lost faith in the Quaker brand name. Even the Chex brand Maple flavor (natural) oatmeal is all natural. General Mills has announced that all of their cereals will be rid of artificial flavors and colors. Shameful for Quaker and with no heath benefits for consumers.
1,So far I tried the lemon coconut and the cinnamon pecan. They're okay tasting, but not easy to eat. I think because the bars are mostly made of puffed grain, so they are extremely dry. I'm not a big fan of the flavors, but it's nearly impossible to find a protein bar that tastes good and isn't a ton of sugar and calories, so I don't hold the flavor of these bars to a very high standard. I think as a quick supplement to hold you over until a better meal these are fine. I will finish the box and just remember to have a drink handy to help get them down.
1,I did not like these, they tasted like rice to me.	I gave them away.	That is a personal preference, however.
1,Just reviewing the product here.	Service/delivery was perfect.	The product itself, tastes like crap!	Way too much salt (sodium) in it (about 50% of the daily recommended value), and the bitter flavor of 'can'.	that's all it tastes like.		They make quite the amount of money for a penny's worth of spaghetti, a few grams of chicken, and chicken grease!		No vegetables, no spices, no flavor other than can, and salt.		I won't be buying this anymore!
1,Chips are pretty good but this bag is not worth the price. there is nothing but crumbs in the bag. Its like a snack for a  toddler size.
1,husband did not like them
1,I'm just not a fan of the gooey consistency of Larabars in general. Sorry
1,would no buy again
1,The flavor was just "ok" in my opinion,  for me it wasn't good enough to justify the price of a reorder, something I do often when I find products my family enjoys.  I've never bought this before so I don't know if I received a bad bag or if what I received is normal for this product.  Some of the pieces were heavily salted while some you could only detect a light sprinkling of salt. The kettle corn flavor was hardly noticeable and every kernel was either super small or broken.
1,Made in Mexico, Same price for less amount. Shame on Nabisco, The USA supported you for so long then you just leave us high and dry.
1,Be aware, this mascara application brush is not like your normal mascara.  Also, not as waterproof as my regular mascara.
1,Out of all of the Quaker oat meals, this is the worst one. Is has a pasty consistency, somewhat flavor less and I'm not sure what the 'nut' part really is.
1,If you want a Snickers bar and expect full size peanuts, buy the full size version. The minis contain chopped/minced peanuts and do not pack anything more than a sugar kick w a hint of peanut flavor. Otherwise, the packaging was good and the product was fresh. I'm going to toss a bag in the freezer to see if that helps...
1,Arrived only two days before their expiration date, gross!
1,Not sure why the taste is flat. When I get this brand in the half gallon at the store, it is chocolaty. This box had no flavor at all.
1,Too much sugar!
1,a little to sweet
1,Did not clean--PERIOD!  Wouldn't get out any dirt or easy to remove stain.  I am going back to ALL. The only thing nice was the smell, unfortunately, that only lasted before going into the dryer.
1,Not much peanut flavor, but then after the Cinnamon Bun Oreos, most anything would pale by comparison.  Nabisco might try the same filling with their golden cookie.  I can't imagine how these ever made it past product testing.  The 2nd bag will probably go to the Food Pantry.  Someone hungrier than I may appreciate them more.  I will not repurchase.
1,Had not tried this scent and won't try again.  Almost smells like Kool-Aid...not good.  Will keep around for emergencies only.
1,Very hard, didn't show up at all even though I have very light brows. These hurt to use. Awful product.
1,Some of the cans of stew were very old - green mold covering the all the items and box, after exploding in shipment.  This was shipped to my brother in college who tried to clean one item but got very sick due to food poisoning.  The box and items had to be discarded
1,this is awful
1,Tasted like a oatmeal spice. Did not like at all
1,terrible flavor, dry texture. won't buy again
1,perfect size
1,I don't think that this product works as well as some of the other brands.
1,It didn't taste very good.
1,As I type this I am eating a Kashi peanut butter chewy granola bar. It is dry. It doesn't have much flavor. It is better than the Chocolate Almond and Sea Salt bars by a mile. I tried really hard to like these because I had six of them to eat. They have little flavor, they have a dry texture, and what you see on the package is a lot like my dating profile picture: it is a much nicer version of what you will see in person. The only saving grace of this bar is that it is fairly health in the whole scheme of things, at least when compared to candy bars, and you aren't likely to eat too much because of the taste so it has built in calorie control!
1,Taste is not good
1,good trace, beware they were crushed at the bottom of the box it came in
1,Pasta good, packaging horrible
1,Meh. Cheap and weak. Only bought them to get free shipping.
1,Not the best razor, but they are fairly inexpensive.
1,I haven't eaten these in years but I don't remember them being so sweet and I don't like sweet cereal. Though in all fairness they are not anywhere as sweet as most sweetened cereal.
1,Smallest bag ever for almost $2.
1,Too hard. It actually hurt to brush my teeth. :( The handle is very uncomfortable as well. I do not recommend them unless you like super hard bristles.
1,Very dry and yucky
1,very strong unappealing odor
1,Awful. Truly awful.	Stale, crumbly, greyish, bland, and nasty. The filling is like a bland paste. These used to be good. The box I got was only a couple weeks from expiration when I received it.	Will not buy again.
1,Worst taste ever. Horrible!
1,1not as tasty a s I had hoped.
1,Makes my mouth dry.
1,Body was thin, the flavor has a slight chemical tasting component reminiscent of cooked onions and the acidity was very high.
1,Weak flavor. Dumplings were odd.
1,Most awful thing ever! Tastes like old shoes or dirty socks would. Would not even insult a dog with this slop.
1,Poor quality. Used to be amazing, but now they just crumble and fall apart. I don't know what happened, but they're terrible now. I feel like I wasted my money on these. I used it to literally wipe my sink down and it fell apart. are you serious? to wipe my sink?! It was only dust and soap residue! They used to last through multiple cleaning jobs when I cleaned my grandmothers house. So disappointed.
1,Gross. Just no. No, no, no. It tasted rancid. Won't buy again.
1,I've ordered these a couple of times before in a smaller size.  Used to love them, but the taste is really off now.  Either the recipe has been changed, or the crackers go stale in such large quantities.  I've had trouble with the quality of food products with Amazon vs local stores, and this is no exception.
1,Yuck !  I like sparkling juices and sparkling flavored waters, and this doesn't taste like either.  For the 80 calories (of sugar), I expected something that had a flavor more like sparkling juice, but this was very watery in its flavor.  It was not overtly 'grapefruit', but a general citrus flavor- not bad but not what I ordered.  I took three sips, and threw away the rest of that can along with the remainder of that 4-pack, and the other one I'd ordered.  I'm sticking with Izze.  THAT is actual sparkling juice- not some leftover food waste marketed to sell.
1,Weird taste
1,This stuff sucks, it made me sick. Also, its RED in whatever red shade stains carpets the most. I wouldn't drink this garbage again even if somebody held a gun to my head.
1,I purchased this lipstick on a whim while filling my pantry box. I was thinking it was a nice enough color to pair with my light skin. While the color itself is awesome you really can't see it through all the shimmer! It was like I coated my lips in very finely ground glitter. Thankfully it was a bit salvageable with some translucent powder dusted over it. Otherwise it would have been one star.
1,Tastes and feels like bacon.. but very salty. Wont be buying this again
1,I wanted root beer, but Prime didn't have Barqs which is my preferred root beer. Barqs is a Coke product and apparently Amazon must only have a deal with Pepsi. Mug tastes too watery for me, it doesn't have that heavy caramel flavor. I've actually been forcing myself to drink through it because I don't like it. I've been cutting it with a good molasses-whiskey.
1,Box smashed
1,I tried this out of curiosity, and I think I'll stick with the cheap Ramen.  It has a funny plastic flavor.
1,Ugh - I can't eat this stuff.
1,I missread this,  I thought it was cleaner with bleach but it doesn't contain bleach. If it isn't bleach it's not good enough for a bathroom, especially when that bathroom Belongs to two little boys!
1,This did not taste like Kung Pao Noodle. It looked like a PHO noodle bowl with no taste...
1,This smells awful and tastes just like it smells..AWFUL!  I love Campbell's regular chicken and noodle soup so how can one with better ingredients tastes so BAD!  I will never buy their organic brand again.
1,this drink has i really cant answer because  it is a different taste some will love it some will not so much i bought 2 cases i will mix it with a  summer drink lol that works for me
1,A little too robust for my taste. The hint of chocolate is barely there.
1,Just something about the taste. A tad over bearing and has an after taste. I really like most of the Knorr products, this is not one of them. Flavor is one of those things that is truly up to the individual, however my gf doesn't like it either and she normally likes the things I don't. Won't be buying this particular one again.
1,don't last
1,not what is advertised different cereal.
1,What happened?! Is this the Band-Aid brand rejects? So far half of these that we used either stretched apart while opening, or had little to no stick to them. Come on Band-aid, you can do better! Go for the cloth type or waterproof ones if you are going to buy band-aid brand.
1,Way too sweet! A huge sugar rush in one bite of this cookie you might as well eat a whole lb of cane sugar. However...this other brand I found is so much better that you actually DO taste the oatmeal and raisins.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kashi-Cookies-Oatmeal-Raisin-Flax-8-5-Ounce/dp/B00ZWJA7RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kashi Cookies, Oatmeal Raisin Flax, 8.5 Ounce</a>
1,What has happened to Planters quality?  I used to buy these and get a really good mix of peanuts, almonds, brazil nuts, filberts, pecans, and cashews.		No more.		My can was well over half peanuts -- more like 75-80%.  I got ** 4** brazil nuts, maybe 8 or 10 filberts, a few pecans (mostly small pieces), a healthy handful of almonds, and NO cashews that I could find, unless they were in pieces that look like peanuts.  I certainly didn't taste any.		Overly salty, too.  Just not worth it.  Will purchase only "premium" nut blends at the supermarket in the future.  Sorry.
1,I buy a lot of convenience-package cleaning products, in the hopes of convincing my kids to be a little more involved in keeping the house tidy. These glass wipes at first glance seemed like a good option for quickly cleaning bathroom mirrors, windows, and glass tabletops. True, it is easy and quick to grab a tub of wet wipes for those chores, but the quality of the work suffers for that convenience. This product leaves streaks and haze behind, which even very vigorous rubbing doesn't improve.		Two stars because this cleaner is probably OK for people who 1)hate cleaning generally, and 2)hate cleaning so much they don't mind if it's not done too well. I'm leaving this tub for the kids to finish off in their rooms where I don't have to be bothered by the streaks and haze.
1,I wish I had know that this was basically flavored water, it is ghastly...  I don't like sativa and that is one of the ingredients and it tastes like chemicals.  Sorry I purchased this water.  TOO sweet imo, and doesn't really taste like coconut water, more like artificially sweetened down water with a hint of coconut, left a horrible aftertaste too.  I love coconut water but not this stuff.
1,Not for me .. way way to sweet!
1,I thought that they were expired after tasking the first one but they were not going to expire for 6 more months.  There was a strange after flavor.  The kids also didn't like it.  I tried hiding the flavor by eating them dipped in apple butter but found myself tasting the odd flavor even hours later despite having a drink.  I don't know what was wrong with this box.
1,Yuck. Wayyy too sweet. I was expecting water with a hint of lemon- not sugar with a hint of lemon and water.
1,flavor was flat
1,Among the scent and cleaning power I like it.		Why the price went up $1.20 this month I don't like...
1,To be fair - I can't really test this product long enough to tell if it has a volumizing effect - which so far it doesn't - but again, can't test it any longer because this smells DISGUSTING.  Beware.  I love smelly soaps and shampoos, and it's very rare I find one I don't care for.  This has neither a floral, fruity, or clean soapy smell - it's smells like some cloying sweet candy gone wrong, and the smell is VERY strong - it ALMOST smells like something sugary that has been rotting away outside in the heat for a week.		I am not joking.  Haven't looked at other reviews to see if others agree - but believe me - this shampoo is just not worth it.  There are so many better smelling products out there.  I realize smell is not the most important aspect of a shampoo - but you know, one that makes you want to get sick in the shower is probably not worth your time.		***ETA - Just in case anyone is wondering what kind of nut I am - as far as other L'Oreal product go, I am absolute in LOVE with the smell of every other L'Oreal product I have ever tried, from their hair care to their facial products, etc.  It's not as though I don't like the general "scent" I associate with L'Oreal.  This product smells NOTHING LIKE any of the other products the company makes.  Smells like something you might buy 12 years expired.  No joke.
1,Can't taste any salt .  Don't like so much
1,Thought it would taste like the "Other sparkling Mineral water"...nope.	oh well
1,Too much orange & not enough cinnamon. Not for me...
1,not awesome
1,Does Not taste  at all like 7 layer dip!
1,OK nothing great it will clean your hair but I think the advertising to overboard!
1,Terrible! Too sweet and a strong, strong, vanilla aftertaste! This is for people who are not afraid of becoming a diabetic!
1,Worst tasting drink I ever had
1,I react as if I have the flu if I take this product, so I have stopped after two uses.
1,I like these, but they are so inconsistent, box to box and even bag to bag.  You can get 1 or 2 over-cooked ones in a bag, or a whole tube of them.  From 1 edge brown to both sides brown.		Crackers are pretty dry to start with, obviously.  If they're overcooked, it makes a serious taste and texture difference to me.  I switched to these from Zestas because of that same problem.  Now I'm looking for some other brand and hoping I can find one that won't put out inconsistently made product.
1,It's sweet, packed with seeds that get stuck in your throat, doesn't taste at all of pumpkin, and filling after a couple teaspoons. Wouldn't buy again.
1,Leaked all over the ENTIRE prime pantry box that was half food items. NOT impressed with shipping considerations. Won't be able to use much of this to test out the actual product.
1,Oddly, I didn't care much for these, though I love their peanuts in the glass jars.  These just weren't salty and had a lot more 'skins' per bag.  Won't be buying these again, but I'll still buy the jars.
1,Not as expected. didn't work for me. whether i'm doing something wrong or they don't work, I don't know. But i tried them with the shower glass few times, no difference.
1,Used to like it, but Barilla has come out as a homophobic company; so I'll never buy it again.
1,Not what I expected. Pictures did not show how the product really was. I followed the instructions for cooking and tried it with some chicken. The texture feels like plastic, it does not have any taste. I had to throw the whole box in the garbage. Personally I don't like it and would have liked to have seen in pictures how this item really was inside the packet, because I would not have bought this.
1,Dogs didn't care for it very much and we won't be purchasing again. We went back to using Purina One's Chicken and Rice. Purina One's Lamb and Rice is good too.
1,too salty
1,When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!
1,Tastes nothing like a cheeseburger!  Tastes mostly like relish.  If you like relish--you'll like these.  Me...not so much.
1,umm what happened to gushers? theres no gush. just a small wet spot in the middle. not good like they used to be
1,bad product for your eyes per my eye doctor
1,Good product. Only two stars because I was very disappointed with how the dispenser functioned. I'm not sure why but I couldn't get it to pump out smoothly. So I ended up just pouring the stuff out.
1,Package COMPLETELY SMASHED! No whole cracker found ! ! !
1,it was an UGLY nasty grey that I could not even bring myself to taste...I poured it out.....not appetizing to look at at all
1,I don't have a Starbucks around me I have to drive 45 mins to go to one so I seen this and wanted to try because in the summer I hate drinking hot coffee but this its good but u get a metal taste in ur mouth.
1,Too big of pieces for my cats to eat, probably be fine in pieces half the size...
1,Im very disappointed in this pita chips. I wish I would've never tasted it because It was one of the worse experiences I ever had with food. Im not sure how it got so many good reviews but everyone has different taste what taste good to some people might not taste good to others.	This bag wasn't big either in my opinion its very small to be party size compared to other brand of chips. I was only able to take a bite out of one chip and ended up throwing the rest away.		I didn't taste the garlic or parmesan or any flavor it claims to have. THERE IS NO TASTE!  Also the texture of this chip is very and I mean VERY HARD. I had a hard time chewing it that's how hard it is. Its annoying because normally I don't buy brands of chips I never had before but looking for stuff on amazon is a hassle, time consuming and ANNOYING. I	 didn't see all the other choices until after I placed my order and it was too late. I really think amazon needs to do better with setting up the pantry to make it easier to buy and find items. Bottom line is I will NOT buy this brand EVER again, they are so hard to eat im going to throw the rest of the bag in the trash. They have nerves to sell these chips at 5 dollars, Im not sure how much I paid but this is definitely not worth 5 dollars. They made the bag look fancy and expensive but the taste and quality is POOR.
1,Wierd texture and not so moist
1,wallpaper paste
1,the tuna was mushy (no chunks, just tuna mush saturated with water) and really difficult to strain.
1,I purchased these to see how they would work for us. Simply put I wish that I didn't even bother. It was a experience and expense that we could have done with out.	< CON'S	- They don't fit behind all types of towel bars.	- They are not even the size of a napkin unfolded.	- It says 60 count but the box I received was lucky to have half the amount.	- experienced  the same issue as tissues where the next towel  did not drop down. We had to fish for the next one, with wet hands.		I have no Pros that I am able to think of with this product. Grandma and I will go back to just using paper towels. One of the few products I would recommend skipping the experience altogether.
1,This plastic wrap is almost impossible to get out of the box, very hard to use. I gave it two stars instead of one because it does cling once you can wrestle a piece out of the box. I wont' buy it again. What an annoying and hard to use product.
1,They are not Puffs plus Lotion..they are some unknown brand
1,Very dry - probably stale.  Not either chewy, nor crispy.  Just dry.
1,I really like using sriracha in certain dishes.  I tried using this in a few things and just couldn't find anything I liked about it.  Other than the heat that it added.
1,Horrible.  Dry, crumbly, hard.  Had to throw them away.  Inedible.  Would give ZERO stars if possible.
1,Not the best sliced peaches out there.  Usually will find some very soft peaches inside with some bruises.  I really hate lite syrup but in a pinch I will eat anything.  Hit or miss on having good peaches with strong flavor.
1,Not impressed.  Bland flavor and gummy
1,defective and packaging was horrible
1,GARBAGE - the dog had this in pieces within the hour of getting it out of the box.....the rope lasted at least 2 days
1,Every 1 of 5 rips around the drawstring. I have no clue why, it's not too heavy, but whenever I pull the plastic to tie it it will rip out of one side.
1,I personally did not like it, but I am sure that there are people that would.
1,First can I ate, became nauseous.  Ate another can last night.  Became extremely sick to my stomach. Details are too gory to relate.  Not happy with this product.  That being said - I have purchased this same product from my local grocery store and there was no problem.
1,DISGUSTING! It Has NO taste and the chips are as hard as a rock. Priced at 5 dollars a bag I was expecting it to be delicious and it didn't live up to my expectation. I couldn't even get myself to eat one of these, as soon I started chewing I spit it out.
1,You get what you pay for--its a big bottle so theres value in that, but it's not great for your hair. I felt like my hair would get even dryer when I used it, and I was glad to get to the end of the bottle to pick something else. Might be better for people with shorter hair, but for my longer locks, it did no good.
1,As someone else said, "Too watery. Texture of curry is not creamy enough." Also the flavor was weak and a little chalky. Could have been more Paneer in the pouch too.
1,Doesn't work for my fine thin greyish hair. Weighs hair down.
1,yuck, I really hate everything Mcdonalds, don't even now why I bought this, just to throw it away.
1,My child loves Ding Dongs, but these cakes arrived stale and tasted like they were old.
1,Taste like spaghetti os.  pretty gross won't buy these again.
1,Maybe if you steep it for nine years it might become green tea at some point.  Pricey, too.  Really sorry I wasted my money on this.		True Green tea has a unique flavor, and I drank it often in East Asia.  This, is water with a slight green tinge.
1,Too much GMO sugar!
1,Too expensive
1,Couldn't taste the Carmel just taste like some sugar covered nuts
1,Didn't dissolve fully in my front-loading washer.
1,Honestly baking soda and H2O2 (peroxide) works just the same at much lower price! One of the pods broke open during shipping.	Ingredients: oxygen based bleach, sodium carbonate, bleach activator and enzymes.
1,Yuck
1,I don't like the blueberry muffin flavor :( But I have the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor every morning for breakfast!
1,Fail, barely had any mint flavor, I tasted it more burping after I ate it than I did eating it.
1,Packaged noodles smell like play-doh and possibly tastes what play-doh would taste like if I were to eat it. Which I won't do.
1,this is a soft drink, not "water". loaded with sweetener (sucralose). check the label for multiple preservatives too.
1,They taste horrible
1,I just don't like the smell.
1,Yuck, taste like sawdust or something NOT Cheddar. Never aghain.
1,We did not like these toothbrushes at all. First of all the head is very small, and the handle is so thin and tiny that it bends while you are holding it trying to brush your teeth. Also, they are Medium and we prefer Soft bristles, I didn't see that when I placed the order.
1,This is a legitimate, intelligible 1-Star review for this Toilet Paper. It's marketed as dual-textured, double rolls, but the only truth behind that is that, yes, they are double rolls. The issue is they're nowhere near dual-textured. When you rip it off the roll they tear easily in half. You have to focus when you tear a sheet off so that it doesn't rip off at a random location. When you're wiping, it's easy to push your finger through the paper, even when you double over the sheets.  Toilet paper from the dollar store is better than this brand. The only decent takeaway is buying these in bulk saves you some money, but once you realize you now have 12 of these terrible rolls for the next month or two, that instantly become a headache.  Highly recommend you stay away from this brand and look elsewhere.
1,it's all packaging and not much substance. overpriced.
1,The taste of the gravy was not great.  If you wash it off and use a different condiment it is ok.
1,Not very tasty. Crackers are stale'
1,still cant find the mocha and oats fiber one bars...these were good but not what we were looking for
1,Ineffective. Takes multiple wipes and a lot of effort to remove waterproof eye makeup. Save yourself a lot of time, hassle and money, and just buy some baby oil.
1,It's indeed chewy and breaks apart easily, but it had some chemical or artificially flavor which made it taste horrible. Like most cookies it makes you thirsty. It's $2 cookies, can't expect too much from it
1,Nasty slop
1,My husband won't eat anything from McDonalds, but he does like the McCafe regular coffee and will choose it over Starbucks often. I bought these K-Cups expecting a similar taste at home. Not so much. He was bitterly disappointed....or weakly disappointed might be more accurate. Even reducing the water amount and increasing the total cup to use 2 pods, he.still says these are just weak and bland. The Maxwell House Breakfast blend k-cups will be back on our counter from now on.
1,Never buy crackers online. Go to the store- unless you love broken crackers. Learn from my mistake.
1,Huge chunks of sugar in it that are caramelized throws it all off.
1,Packaging deceptive, Shortbread tastes good what there was of it. Bought both sizes & found the same thing; all package, very little product enclosed.
1,The smell is awful. Must be the tar in it. It hasn't really helped my son's scalp yet, but he doesn't use it very much because the smell is terrible.
1,tasted terrible. Wish these quick insta meals lived up to their reputations.
1,This is bitter and weak even when I added alot of coffee.  This does not taste good at all!
1,Only  the bagel  chips  came completely  opened
1,All the fruit cups in my box was scattered and broken into.  What a mess.
1,Works well but leaves a sticky residue on your dishes that is impossible to clean, even if you have a dishwasher. Will not be purchasing again.
1,Not a fresh lemon taste at all. Reminds me of lemon cleaner in scent, especially. I really like their orange tangerine zinger so I thought I would like this one - not so!
1,Nasty. I fed it to our pet pig.
1,this apple juice does not taste good going back to mott,s apple juice is bettere
1,Not good: in texture nor flavor
1,Every single can of these chinto Tomatoes were dented, severely
1,These are really awful. Beyond the overly sugared "shell" there is an amazing amount of red goo and 2 or 3 "cherries" that at no time whatsoever taste anything like cherry.
1,I like more lather in my shampoo and I suggest you have really dry hair if you use this because it leaves my hair really greasy.
1,taste not good
1,don't order this online if you live in a cold area. the medicine was completely separated by the time we got it so unable to use.
1,Great price, but neither of us like the flavor. Just personal taste I guess.
1,Probably would have been great, but when delivered it was left out in the sun.
1,Too watered down. Taste not bad but too runny.
1,Ok if you like your crackers in a million bits. Packing is poor on these so beware.
1,Normally I buy another brand but decided to go with these guys in a recent order. In short, after pouring it into a bowl just before heating it up... it just seemed like a watered down bowl of nothing.  Just very cheap looking... definitely not the "Rich & Hearty" experience i was expecting from the labeling. Didn't even waste my time heating it up. Just ended up just pouring it down the garbage disposal.
1,I like these if only they were not so broken up like I got them. Could not use them for a dip at all.
1,I was hoping this would be a good soft drink alternative, but my boys, 8 & 11, took one sip & that was the end. They do like the Nestle flavored bottled waters,.
1,got my box today and not one single can is not pure crumbs. very sad about this
1,Quite rancid taste & not evidently anywhere near as effective, as Falsely Advertised!
1,none
1,I ordered this but only received one small can and not a pack of 12 small cans. I didn't see any way to respond to Prime Pantry purchases. The one can was as expected...
1,terrible paper towels
1,Ours were out of date before the end of the month.
1,Organic is great and all ,but it was a lot sweeter than I expecting, and the consistency was strange.
1,Very confusing regarding the quantity, reading the Q&A some say they got 4, one even said they got 2, I received 1, thought I was getting 4. Yes I thought that was dirt cheap, but I don't know what the deal actually is supposed to be and the commentary in that Q@A wasn't helpful.		Please put one box in the picture if that's all I'm supposed to get or give me the other 3 boxes I was supposed to get.		Thanks
1,drippng
1,no comment
1,I don't feel like this cleans at all. I find myself brushing three times before I feel good.
1,The brush it absolutely huge!!! Unless you have 3in fake eyelashes, it is very hard to get the mascara on. Very bad design flaw!!!!
1,Gross.. tastes like protein packed together. Where's the chocolate?!
1,These were definitely not my 'cup of tea' per se. I am sure they would appeal to most people but I just did not like the taste. They were nice and fresh though and crunchy like you would expect CHEX to be.
1,Did not care for taste
1,Not quite as I expected in the taste. Bitter.
1,Not too good
1,Not to my taste
1,As far as taste goes- they're great.  Could eat them like candy.  Just wish vitamins had some kind of noticeable effect.  Used the bottle as directed.  If they helped any, I didn't see it.  But they do taste good for those of you wanting vitamins that don't like to swallow pills.
1,Not worth it, doesn't do anything
1,1 bag was broke open:(
1,The first thing I noticed when I opened this soup was a strong onion odor.  When I heated it and tasted it there was an overwhelming onion flavor.  The consistency is not creamy smooth split pea puree but a chunky lumpy soup full of onions.  This is definitely not my idea of how a split pea soup should smell or taste.  I am trying to contact Amazon to send back the unopened second can I purchased.
1,I bought these a while back as emergency snacks and just recently opened one. Despite having a long shelf life, they tasted moldy and unappetizing. I don't know if I got unlucky with my package and it expired quicker than normal or this is just how they taste! Either way, cliff bars is the way to go.
1,A bit like watered down beef broth with veggies thrown in.  And I didn't notice the dumplings at all.  I guess I thought they were a veggie which doesn't say anything good about the soup.  I was expecting the chunky style soups I am use to getting from them.  This wasn't.
1,I did not care for the taste.
1,Taste wasn't the best. I felt like there was a hint of mint in there.
1,Cheap for a reason.  The flavor and texture was underwhelming for sure.  The cuts of meat were fine with nothing with excessive fat or connective tissue, but it was just very weak in flavor.  Brought on a camping trip, and no one really enjoyed this brand.  It was a dud, which is a shame because we saw Sweet Baby Ray's and through it would be the best like the sauce.
1,waste of my money
1,Most disgusting tuna I've ever seen. Can't be drained because the whole product is pure sludge. Should be taken off the market and shame on chicken of the sea, a brand I used to trust. There were no chunks at all so I had to pour the sludge into a fry pan and heat till the liquid evaporated out. Then I added mayo to make it tolerable. ( I hate throwing food away, so I try to make do when I can)
1,For some reason my daughter does not like the berry flavor but does enjoy the peach.
1,What a misleading name. What you really get is bland chunks of potato in a vaguely cheesy sauce. Any presence of broccoli or chicken is a downright lie.
1,Too sweet, ate a couple over a couple of weeks and gave the rest away.
1,I purchase Colgate toothbrushes frequently and am quite satisfied with them. However, I am not so happy with this Colgate Extra Clean manual toothbrush. Besides the fact that I found the toothbrush to be surprisingly flimsy, relatively smaller and the bristles harder, I found the handle of this toothbrush to be oddly pointed- for a regular sized hand, the tip of the handle digs uncomfortably in the palm (pics attached for reference). Because of these reasons, I will not be purchasing this particular model of Colgate.
1,This does not work for me. Doesn't do anything for my migraine headaches.
1,Terrible tasting, very synthetic. Turned me off of waffles altogether. I'm more of a French toast guy now. Brioche, always use brioche.
1,Love the smell but it doesn't work properly
1,These didn't have as much flavor as I would've liked - I wouldn't buy them again.
1,My eyes hurt after applying these, almost like I would put an alcohol on my eyes. If you have sensitive eyes, don't buy it
1,Fruit was kind of hard on the ends. Kind of hard to eat. Wouldn't buy again. Good juice
1,One day after use, there is a lot of dandruff and itching. Very uncomfortable!
1,Not impressed with the flavor at all.  It's a potato chip, so I'll eat them, but I wouldn't buy this flavor again.
1,Love this cleaner. Bottle had been rewrapped because it was leaking. Lost a lot of the cleaner inside the wrapping. HAd leaked through and wet the box
1,tastes like sugar with artificial waterer.  flavor was supposed to be blueberry.  I've tasted blueberries; this was not blueberry flavored.  tasted like artificial sweetener, not as much as in other fake drinks but enough to leave a long aftertaste of it.  has less juice than cheaper sugar water juice drinks.  inexplicably has caffeine
1,Texture and taste are quite subpar. I'm trying to come up with was to make it more edible since I hate to waste food... but I  will never purchase these again
1,These raisins were very dry and seedy. They did not taste fresh and seemed shelf stale.
1,These rolls are really small. They are soft but we go through them super quick because they are tiny.
1,BLEAH. Awful.  I'm not sure I'd ever be desperate enough to finish this.  The sausage/rotini flavor was much better than this one
1,Wasn't real crazy about this flavor. A little too bland, and not quite a traditional PB&J taste.
1,These were stale..hard as rocks. YUCK. Went into the garbage.
1,These taco shells break easily and they're small so they don't hold much.
1,rubbery, small, not at all what I remembered.
1,Band-aid bix all ripped and instead of 80 only 71 arrived!!!
1,Burns my mouth when brushing. Very strong toothpaste. Nothing like Sensodyne. It does help with sensitivity when you're not actually USING it :-/		It contains SLS as a top ingredient, which I think is the reason for the harshness. I also think it causes canker sores.		Won't buy again.
1,You would think that all Kraft Mac and Cheese was the same. It is not. This box contains 2 dry ounces LESS than the store bought one.  The box is the same size but the contents is not. Who woulda thought? The shape of the pasta makes it cook up differently too.
1,Good
1,Overpriced for results.  The "Attacks even 7 day old stains?"  not sure what it means but I tested that theory out on a white cotton t-shirt I used to wipe up some oil i spilled which changing the oil on my jeep.  OK i didn't expect this to really get the oil out, just wanted to see how much it could get it out.  The shirt washed just fine but as expected the dark oily splotches faded a little but were mostly still there.  Ok so I can be amused by ridiculous advertising sometimes and the nature of 7 day old stains was just bothering me.  So, I waited 3 more days (because I didn't have the patience to wait a full six) and I washed the shirt again and to my surprise, there was no change.  The stains were still there and it hadn't even ben 7 days later.  As a contrasting experiment I used Gain and washed the short again with a bunch of socks and you know what, the darn Gain made a huge difference on the stains beyond the 7 day mark.  Its doubtful in most cases you will use a shirt to wipe up an oil spill but you will spill oily things on your shirt and don't be fooled by this ridiculous notion this Tide is any different than any other laundry detergent is claims to be better than.  The 7 day old stain is a worthless bit of marketing and unfounded.  Buy Gain if you want something that I have proven to myself does in fact work better than Tide AND smells much better.
1,I bought three different kinds of these fast microwaveable meals by different companies for work to see how they stack against each other. This one was the worst. Though there is probably nothing wrong with the meat and noodles the cheese that it's all soaked in tastes terrible. Not like cheese at all really and very bland and plastic tasting.		if your like me and looking for a fast meal for work, I recommend looking elsewhere. I talked to a coworker that I saw eating microwaveable meals and he recognized what I was eating and said that they are indeed terrible.
1,Not impressive.  Very little apple flavor. Very little flavor at all. Small single serving package a bit pricey. I guess it's ok if you want to munch on puffed up air with calories.
1,Salty too many peanuts!
1,did not seem to work at all, either on my granite or my stainless steel.....spots still visible..
1,Unfortunately, I could not give a solid review of these chips because I received them (all the chips were broken and unusable).  Have eaten Lay's chips before and they were great.
1,They are bitter,mushy and overpriced. Would never buy them again.  I couldn't believe the reviews I read about the bitterness but then I tasted them  ,my husband agreed they were bitter and mushy. I'll stick with SunSweet.  I usually like Newmans Own products but not this one.
1,So I went to the supermarket and they have the chocolate Krave & the Smor's Krave on sale. The price was 3 for $5 and I was happy and bought a bunch. This is my first and last time having anything to do with anything called Krave, they are beyond disgusting. I threw away the 2 open ones and gave the rest to my friend who is financially challenged and will eat anything that is not poisonous.	By the way if you add milk to Krave it goes from disgusting to garbage dunked in milk and blended with fish guts.
1,Came as one big clump.
1,Within days the grass started growing a white mold on it.  My cats puked a lot after eating the grass and it started to brown within 2 weeks.  Sad as I had high hopes for this.
1,These "Real" Bacon bits were so awful I doubt there "real" status. I checked the date they were suppose to be good until 1/15. They didn't have any bacon smell. Just this smokey smell. To be totally serious I fed my dogs bacon treats that smelled better then these did. Yet I tried a couple thinking they had to taste better then they smelled with all the good reviews. Yuck they were disgusting tasting! I can't begin to describe it however I will politely say it was shudder inspiring. Won't ever buy again!
1,Taste olds
1,I took a while to review this deodorant, wondering if I would eventually change my mind about it but I haven't. I normally do not review items that I feel are necessities but this is the first time I was let down by a deodorant. First issue is that it seems drying to my skin. I have never experienced that. It does not go on as smoothly and when I use it I can tell a difference in how my skin feels, in a bad way. It also does not last all day. I used a different brand normally that is not even advertised to be long lasting and it holds better, smells better, and goes on smoother than this one. I purchased this to try it out because it seemed like a good price. I was not impressed. It works, I have just used better.
1,not worth 99 cents
1,I must be the odd one out here. Now, I don't know if this is a bad batch, if Amazon is the new Family Dollar, or if this is just the "new" recipe for Frosted Flakes. I grew up on Frosted Flakes. As a pre-teen, I ate them every day. As a teen I ate them quite often. I ate them with milk, I ate them straight from the box, I ate them with melted marshmallows like a Krispie treat. As an adult, I've had them occasionally. I hadn't had them in a couple of years, so I got some... from Amazon... mailed to me in my Prime Pantry box.		These are not the Frosted Flakes I grew up on. They are not the ones I ate every day as a pre-teen, nor quite often as a teen. Neither are they the ones I used to make "Rice Krispie" bars a few years ago. These are corn flakes with barely any frosting on them at all. There are two things that make Frosted Flakes better than regular corn flakes... 1) The sugary frosting that makes them sweet without having to add extra sugar and.. 2) the sugary frosting that makes them sweet without having to add extra sugar ALSO makes them more crunchy and makes them last longer in milk before they go soggy.		The old flakes... http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/6261616/600full-frosted-flakes.jpg	The new flakes... http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3471/5802226853_ceabdfc49f.jpg		This box was a grave disappointment. So whether or not they were lacking "frosting" on purpose or by accident. These were just lackluster regular 'ol soggy sugarless flakes. Too bad.
1,I love Bai waters, but I HATED this flavor.
1,Other than the boxes being left on my porch soaking wet when the delivery person knew it was supposed to rain & the boxes falling apart & all paper packaged products & cardboard packaged products inside being soaked as well this product is what is to be expected.
1,Way too much chese for my taste.
1,too small
1,I love most Beanitos flavors and chips, but these were completely inedible. I hated the flavor. Had to throw it away, I couldn't find anyone around me who WOULD eat them.
1,not my favorite
1,It might be great, I don't know because all three cans were so **badly** dented I wouldn't use them. I mix canned chicken with my foster dogs food when I run out of real chicken. She loves chicken, but these cans went in a garbage. Amazon, seriously no dented cans please!!!
1,I was expecting more. The grapefruit is very bitter
1,too sweet
1,Not very tasty. ..not what I expected
1,Don't like blue detergent........
1,Why would you put this item in with bottles of ketchup, mayo, jelly, peanut butter, and other heavy products when the box had a center area with NOTHING in it.. I did not get Scoops, I got crushed.  Guess I can't order anything that will get crushed from now on.....
1,leaves streaks, I prefer windex.
1,I couldn't wait to use this up so I wouldn't have to use it any more.  The scent is awful and it doesn't cut the oil on my skin very well.  I bought the rhubarb scent at the same time, and I like that one better.
1,Bag falls in the can all the time!
1,This Shampoo/Conditioner combination has made my hair very strawlike and so that I cannot comb it when I get out of the shower. Since I have EXTREMELY long hair this is a major issue for me. Also, since I pay upwards of $85 to have my hair done, I don't want to ruin my color with products that destroy my hair at home. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with these products. I'll have to stick with my Pantene.
1,Very high price for such little butt wipes. They are soft enough but the wipes are just too small. I won't purchase these again; I can get way more product for way less.
1,I've never eaten goat feces, but I imagine this is what they would taste like. Disgustingly horrible.
1,Again ours went out of date before the month was up
1,its real go pop but its allgone the price was right and I grsabed now will buy it in the store save price but at 5.69 a 12 pack
1,Was a bit disappointed .  Not as expected .
1,Pies molded and rotten. Just barely within expiration date of July 06, 2016.
1,Eating this was like eating a cup of syrup with sugar cubes. Way too sweet, my daughter wouldn't even eat it.
1,No pork.  I mean, was someone thinking about pigs when they were canning this?		Also, why High Fructose Corn Syrup?  I thought people were on the anti-GMO bandwagon.  It's my own fault for not reading the can before purchase.		Never again.  Too sweet, no meat, lousy product.
1,This was not less than 50% peanuts, more like 50+% regular peanuts
1,Didn't care for these.  They reminded me of weird raisins.
1,Alright, when I first ordered this product it was through prime pantry and priced at $1.50 per container.  Turns out that was a special sales price, and although I thoroughly enjoyed the popcorn, which is quite delicious and easy to make; it's still just popcorn not steak!  It's now selling for $17.23 per container.  Sorry Pine Valley Foods and Amazon, while it's nicely packaged and convenient to make, and very tasty to boot, it's still just popcorn!
1,I didn't like the favor of the cookie or "raspberry" filling. These Archway cookies are labeled both naturally and artificially flavored but they tasted more artificial to me. One gets very little fruit filling surrounded a big, soft, crumbly blah-tasting cookie. Considering that raspberry-filled cookies are one of my favorites, this eating-experience was quite surprising. I didn't finish the box and will not purchase this product again.
1,Too much cookie and not enough filling.
1,Didn't work well for me. Tried using this on some typical soap scum in the tub and I had to scrub quite a bit to clean the tub.
1,They taste fishy
1,Well I knew what I was getting into with packaged food however the taste was unbearable threw it all out
1,I had higher hopes for this product. I play outside a lot in the scorching summer sun in temps sometimes over 80-90 degrees F. After a few weeks using this product to help protect my face (and maybe getting rid of the slowly growing smile lines) I've sweat this stuff off my face within 30 minutes of being active. It drips into my eyes and burns quite a bit. When I've used this product overnight it DOES moisturize my slightly sunburnt skin, though it also has caused 3 fairly big zits on my face. It did NOTHING to prevent my face from getting sunburnt during a Saturday afternoon on a hot day in July. I've used a few other Olay products that I had decent results with, but this isn't one of them.
1,Trip down memory lane, but as with a lot of cracker type products, I think a lot of the contents got crushed en route.
1,Got this for hubby months ago. He really does not like it. Still have 5 bottles left. Since we love cherry flavor in almost everything, this was a big disappointment.
1,ok, but I don't care for the smell
1,Now, this is a subjective review. I did not enjoy these cookies at all. The mint flavor tasted artificial and pasty. The cookies break apart quickly if you try to separate them manually like you can do with other Oreo cookies. I've had a package that lasted so long uneaten by family members that I eventually threw it away. These are really not good at all.
1,Not the Rice Krispies I grew up on! These have a bland, almost bitter taste and they are very small cubes. Will not buy these again!
1,I bought this product expecting it to smell more feminine.  Instead it smells more like Mennen Men's Deodorant.  I gave it to my husband instead.
1,smashed in box
1,can soaked--label falling off--some of broken soup can on top of chowder can
1,Too watery
1,This would probably be okay for some (my son likes it) but it doesn't float my boat.  It has a strange aftertaste that I can't abide.  I am used to artificial sweeteners so am used to some lingering taste, but this is really unpleasant.  I threw it away as I just couldn't drink it.
1,Too sweet and gets super soggy. Yukkkk!!
1,They call it Reuben but I don't taste it.
1,Not so good
1,stale
1,Too spicy for me because I expected more Balsamic flavor.  The apples make the mix chewy, causing G the almonds to become soft, and stale tasting.
1,These drops don't do much for serious dry eye problems.
1,Dopes not warm the skin and dries up quickly. Not good for massage.
1,It didn't taste like wheat.
1,This shouldn't even be in the chili category,mildly spicy and had a distinct ketchup based taste to it. I know in most cases chili,or hot food in general is often average tasting to allow adding stuff to make it spicier but,this wasn't very well to its described 'hot' taste at all
1,Disappointed, when I opened my first  package the cookie was all broken into small pieces.  The package they come in can't be be resealed - so I ate the entire package at one sitting which is too many calories, they are like a cracker whereas I assumed they'd be chewy.  Won't purchased these chocolate Belvita cookies again.		The reviews are so highly rated for these Belvita I am shocked.		Edited:  Not worth sending back (food you know) on second package and I absolutely AGREE with the above statement - equating to LOUSY - don't purchase Belvita snacks.  H-O-R-R-O-B-L-E.  Other one here (Quacker Chewy Chocolate Breakfast Cookie) is excellent but not always available..  You can purchase Quacker right here at Amazon.  SEE Ya
1,It's not creackers. It's like weat cereal pillow shaped, i tried once. Dont like it. Like you are eating thin spagetti uncooked.
1,The description was not accurate, I received only 1 pouch and it will be expired in less than two months. I would not buy it again for this price. There is no clusters at all, only grains and seeds are on the bottom.
1,Brush is too thick for my liking
1,Chalky tasting
1,This product came with the bottom row seal not broken but 1 cup is 1/3 fill and other 2 3/4 full top ones ok
1,kinda nasty
1,You get mostly one flavor and one or two of the others. I think they use a cheap, or old, corn kernels because there are hard husks in every single piece of popped corn. One, it hurts and two, trying to dig it out from between teeth is painful, and three, getting them stuck in the back of your throat is just gagworthy annoying
1,These were out dated when I received them. Not nearly as good as I remember them.
1,It is really cold and does not feel nice on skin.
1,Not that great. The flavor is a bit off.
1,Like far too many additives--falsely advertised & largely In-Effective, as a supplement--like far too many falsely advertised products, by pharmaceutical Companies, across the board!
1,Letdown, no taste, very  thin
1,This broth literally tastes like nothing. It is good that it is unsalted. But really should improve their ingredients.
1,Does not take off waterproof mascara-- at all... (Maybelline Great Lash Mascara Waterproof)
1,My granddaughter does not like this toothpaste and only used it once.
1,Horrible...stale
1,This smells and tastes nice, but it is very runny. I bought it for my 3 yr old and after a couple days of use I found drips all over my bathroom. It literally drips out as soon as the cap is open. If you can handle that you'll love it. If you have an all too independent 3 yr old as I do, beware of the mess that comes with.
1,Box open & flattened !
1,came in melted
1,I don't like the flavor and my 6yr old won't drink it either. It is too sweet for me.
1,Definitely bummed since these came and were almost stale....but I suppose that's what I get for buying taco shells online. I ended up throwing the box out after eating 1/4 of the first shell and remaking my tacos with the tortillas I had.
1,Not good if you have EBS. Don't use this if you have it.
1,Gross and takes forever to cook.
1,Nothing wrong with this item, just my taste and I'm sorry to say I didn't like the flavor.
1,These were not BIG ROLLS! regular ones instead. Disappointed.
1,You came here thinking you were going to see rave reviews about how Nabisco cracked the atom in making a new and "exciting" cookie flavor, wrong. These are hunks of brown play dough disks with bits of yellow play dough placed over the surface of the "cookies". I put the word cookie in quotes because it appears someone at Nabisco made these things so soft they are more like nasty peanut butter cup than a cookie. What went wrong?		I think the problem is that they chocolate is misrepresented in this equation. The only reason people buy jars of Reeces Peanut Butter is because they are mentally unstable. These cookies taste sickly of the peanut butter with nothing to stop you from revealing the dirty secret behind it. The "Peanut Butter" they use could hardly be called a peanut butter. Sometimes I like to think I am trying something because I think it might be a good idea but I secretly knew they couldn't replicate the formula for cups into a cookie. Something about not having the chocolate to lean on leaves the nasty peanut butter exposed to the world.		This product is disgusting and the peasants who enjoy it would shove virtually any sweet into their mouths to sate their constant hunger for Type 2.
1,These are just regular Tortillas, shaped in a way, it's impossible to eat without a knife and fork, causing a mess. You cannt pick up and eat. They are too big, and too flimsy.
1,I didn't really like the Apple flavor :( But I have the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor every morning for breakfast!
1,Did not like these flavor triscuits at all.
1,I couldn't try them at all as the boxes were exploded. The order was made through Pantry and the two boxes arrived. They are massive boxes (something you can't tell unless you have a good grasp of proportions). I love this brand and this version of the pancakes. I just hated the experience from this vendor. I couldn't return it for 'some reason'.
1,I thought this was unscented, my mistake.  I don't like the smell, the oil is lighter than the unscented ones I've purchased in the past and overall, not great.
1,awfullll
1,Meh. Will not purchase again.
1,Tastes like burnt toast.
1,Watch out this loaded with "High Fructose Corn Syrup....BAD!!
1,Can't use with anything hot. Will burn and fuse together. The size is awfully small too. NOT a happy customer.
1,didnt like it very much it did taste bad
1,This one I didn't care for. The taste was too artificial
1,Great product but it was opened some in the Pantry box, and it got all over the other items in the box. So it was a small bottle to begin with for the amount of money you paid. Not worth getting besides being split all over every thing. It was not packaged in a bag. We were a little dissapointed.
1,These pieces of dried fruit look like they might have started out as apricots, but they are mostly brownish-black with a few spots of brownish-orange.  They look like the fruit was allowed to over ripen before being dried, and they taste that way too: so over ripened as to be almost nothing but a little fiber with fructose and no flavor of apricots whatsoever.  If you're looking for a soft, very sweet dried fruit with little real flavor of its own to add sweetness to a dish, these will be just the thing.  If you're looking for dried apricots that actually taste like apricots, give these a very wide berth.  A few astronomical units should do.
1,I'm sorry, but this stuff really has no taste. I'm sticking with Swanson.
1,I LOVE this flavor of Kind Bars.  I bought two boxes of these here on Prime Pantry and both of the boxes were rancid.  You could smell and taste that the nuts had gone rancid.  All well within the expiration date also.  I bought some singly in the local store with a similar expiration date and they were fine.  Waste of money.
1,I would eat this in an emergency only.  The marinara tastes like ketchup with a heavy chemical aftertaste.  I love how the packaging looks so appetizing though.		The pasta itself seems to be cooked well but the sauce is just off.  The other flavors weren't much better.
1,Not so tasty! Nobody will drink it, finally had to throw away the bottles that were left in the fridge so they would stop taking up space.
1,Palm oil YUCK,  They should be required to have a big sticker or stamp on products that use stuff like this or allergens or GMO.
1,This perfecting base broke out my face the very first time I used it!  I tried it three times, each time with the same results. It is certainly not made with natural ingredients - I will never purchase this product again.  I do not normally have sensitive skin - so I was very surprised at the reaction this stuff caused.  What a waste of money.
1,Not a bad cereal or a bad option, but it's a misnomer/hyperbolic name for a cereal...there aren't many pumpkin seeds or raisins, and the crunch comes from the relatively bland bran. Canceled my S&S immediately; wish I'd tried one box before I sprang for 6.
1,Yuck it smelled horrible
1,Trans Fat, really Pop Secret? Who uses this poison any more?! Should have looked at the label more carefully before purchasing.
1,Much better deal at Costco - I was shocked when I opened-up my prime delivery box and saw how small the box was
1,I did like this foot balm. I looked at the ingredients and thought it would be more moisturizing seemed to dry out my heels.
1,no disrespect Wolfgang...Sorry the soup is very bland and over priced .  Campbell s soup still has the best taste for the pallet
1,I really didn't appreciate the size of these bars when I read the description, so I'll give you some context to keep you from making the same mistake:		If you take one of these mini snacks and fold it in half, it will be just about the same size as one of those "Fun Size" Snickers bars that come in bags for Halloween.		You may also notice these snack bars are also about the same price as one of those bags ($4 - $5 as of this writing), but instead of 30 bite-sized candies you get 6. You may also get an added helping of bitterness and resentment, but your mileage may vary.		I would not recommend these for preventing a sugar crash either because they're designed to burn off carbs slowly.		Honestly, you're better off spending $5 on a package of sugar tabs and a bag of oranges.
1,its hard as a rock, and it taste ok.  My baby is teething but he seems to not care for it and he eats everything but that.
1,I love Acqua Panna. Imagine when I chilled this and opened the bottle, tilted it up and drank and it tasted not so good. Checking the date on the bottle revealed that it had been marinating on plastic for over a year. I'll buy it at the grocery from now on. In glass.
1,Very greasy, horribly salty and mushy.
1,This is too salty!! Will not buy again.
1,I had to throw it away, not my taste at all
1,def not a fan of this flavor
1,i was looking for something that i could have for breakfast every morning.  this just had No taste to it. I Love oatmeal raisin cookies but these don't even compare. i am disappointed.
1,Yucky! Will stick to Trader Joe's boxed soups.
1,It's not the Sellers fulat, it's the weather, All the chocolate melts before you get it into the fridge... Must be cold to order this and it sits in the UPS TRUCK TO Long too.
1,I love Pumpkin Spice but didn't much care for this. It was a lot of spice and very little pumpkin or coffee flavor. It was palpable when I added a shot of espresso to it.
1,Maybe got a bad batch, but they taste like cardboard. They even smell like it, despite them having a "honey" flavor. I ate 3 and threw the box in the trash.
1,Gift?
1,I can't eat this, please get Mueller's products.
1,THEY USE A SWEETNER WITH A TERRIBLE AFTER TASTE AND USE WAY TOO MUCH. DON'T GET THIS, IT'S WASTED MONEY.
1,Smashed, spilled in the box with the other smashed, dented or broken items.
1,not a fan
1,The almonds were much softer and did not taste as fresh as other brands.
1,I actually love this product but I don't understand why it's mostly gmo corn syrup. If they would just make it with cocoa and sugar I'd give it 5 stars, but until they do it will be 2.
1,Did nit like the taste of the strawberries.  Bitter.
1,Please don't use this for bed sore  recovery barrier. Use something like  Calmoseptine Ointment.  It is what our hospital uses as part of their wound care protocol. However, when my grandmother was transferred to a rehabilitation center.  We were told Desitin was the same thing.		Having been a new born and toddler nursery worker for many years. I was very familiar with Desitin for diaper rash and seen it work very well unless your baby has a cod liver sensitivity or allergy. I had never heard of Desitin being used for my grandfather when my rather was ill but we tried it at the center's insistence.		It did nothing for grandma and when she was released to being Home Health her bed sores were pretty bad.		While I decided to share information in this review regarding a off label use to try and help those in a similar situation.  This isn't why I  chose to only give it 2 *  As that doesn't seem right to me. Rather the low rating is based on our families experience with Desitin  as a  diaper rash treatment. It wasn't effective because of fish and shellfish allergies.  When it comes to very young babies a lot of things are hypo-allergenic and top 8 Allergens free. Those products seem a much safer product.
1,We love Quaker Oats cereal but this Maple Sugar and Cinnamon is absolutely horrible tasting.  It may have only 4 grams of sugar instead of the 12 grams in the regular package but it isn't making it taste good.  I'd never purchase this again.  Sticking to my favorate apple and cinnamon.		Disappointed customer.  Expected a much more flavorful taste.
1,Wow, these were bad. I've tried Slim Fast, Equate, and Atkins weight loss shakes. The special K brand is probably the worst of the four. Stick with Slim Fast or Equate.
1,Was not as thick & berry tasting as I had hoped for, also tasted sort of moldy. Won't try it again.
1,Really strong, reminds me of gun powder.  Not my favorite but it is okay.
1,I wanted these vitamin c pack. I received cherry halls.
1,So sweet with a bizarre taste that tastes nothing like onions. Gross.
1,the pump malfunction
1,This would be such a great product if it didn't have a chemistry set taste. I don't understand why as the flavors are not supposed to artificial. Disappointing.
1,Like the taste, low gal drink
1,YUCK!  It's like eating mush.  No oat texture to this product at all.  Would rather wait the time to cook regular steel cut oats.
1,These Mega rolls are too mega! The roll is so big that it won't comfortably tear away for a sheet. This is a case of too big for the need.
1,My kid hates this and the whole line of "Jammy Sammy".
1,Absolutely nothing like Glad Wrap or Saran Wrap. This Is Awful. Doesn't stick to regualr plastic bowls, not a great seal on food, either. I wish I never wasted the money on this. If you want Glad Wrap or Saran Wrap, buy that, and not this instead.
1,I usually don't buy bottled water, except to keep a small stock in the refrigerator in the event of a water outage or such, but I had some room in my Prime Pantry box, and there was an exceptional coupon which put the price near 50 a bottle, so I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say I'm as unimpressed as it gets. It tastes like regular purified water, no difference in taste than to Ozarka. I was expecting a nice crisp taste like with Evian, but it's really just plain water. I would not buy this product again, and would not recommend it to others.
1,is like a can of water with half a bouillon of chicken flavor and sparse of any actual chicken or anything really.  might be good starter to make your own soup with which is how i ended up using it.
1,Didn't taste that great. :(
1,Great idea, leaves the shower smelling great, but not enough scrubbing power.
1,The meal contained some Asiago cheese spread which was good, but there wasn't much of it; some tiny slices of salami, which were good; some crackers that tasted like saltless saltine crackers, that were okay; some tiny cookie bites that I didn't care for, but I think some people would like; and something they called cashew medley, that should have been called raisin medley because it was mostly raisins.  In the future, I will just buy some cheese spread and whole wheat crackers instead of this.  Not worth the price.
1,to strong
1,Beware, the chemical poison BHT included in small dosages as a way of preserving this item.		enough bht buildup can damage your body and or worse.  Most countries make it illegal for companies to sell foods containing bht.  the USA is one of the few that put the businesses before it's citizens and allow for such misconduct.		hopefully you will read this and think seriously about yours families health and start paying attention to what is foods
1,This stuff just falls apart.  Maybe is isn't supposed to be used in the traditional way like other toilet paper.
1,Nice texture, kinda bland.
1,This was absolutely disgusting. The smell of the warmed up cheese was horrible. The taste is also bad. Never again !!
1,dog does seem to like them
1,no go on these. They don't taste like nut. Or banana. Or good.
1,Gravy is for breakfast, not for chips.
1,no flavor
1,not worth the price not that tasty
1,I do not notice any brightening or whitening at all from this product. I live in an area that has very hard water.
1,Sodium overdose.
1,stale
1,no original or even close; much thinner, more brittle, more tasteless, a hint of chemical sort of oat flavor- so some VP figured out how to roll out mush and pretend it was crackers; bought the name; won't again, too expensive for bird food
1,Did not like the taste. This was apart of my first Prime Pantry experience. I normally like Planters so it's nothing against the brand. I still buy other products!
1,It is almost unconscionable to title (and in caps!)  this otherwise good soup with "Beef" as the primary ingredient. In every can I have opened the average number of dime-sized little squares of beef  is five. One amazing can actually had ten of the itty-bitty beef pieces.  If you do not mind the lack of beef, this is actually one of the better vegetable soups on the market and for that reason alone I AM re-ordering. I gave the product one star because my family found  the lack of a substantive beef component frankly disgusting and deceitful and I have to agree with them.
1,Kinda stale though.
1,I bought the granola because Special K usually produces tasty cereals.  My plan was to add the granola to yogurt to bump up the texture and add a little zing.  It didn't work. This is one of the few Special K products I won't buy again.  I thought tasted bad in the yogurt, bad as a snack, and bad as cereal.
1,This  bag arrived completely  open
1,not that great
1,Bag arrived open
1,nasty
1,These wipes were extremely dry. They can hardly get any makeup off. It took me 5+ wipes just to clean my face before I get to the eyes. Will not buy again
1,AWFUL TASTING
1,Too much trouble for a sip or two.
1,Idk if it's just a bad mix for my body chemistry,  but this did nothing for me. Made me smell like that trying to cover up armpit funk smell with perfume or something.  It's too scented.
1,i usually buy the blue scotch brute, tried these to be eco friendly. BUT. they have a HORRIBLE smell to them. we threw it strait in the trash because it smell up the kitchen so bad.
1,I am not a fan of Tuna Fish.  Should not have purchased this product.
1,Package was open all crunched out they put soap on top of the Fritos will not buy again from this
1,Way too sweet and fake sugary flavor
1,Too much sugar!  11 grams is a lot of sugar for something so small.  Cascadian Farms should be ashamed.
1,I just couldn't eat these. They just weren't edible at all.
1,This is probably the worst review I have ever given on any item.  These trash bags are difficult to separate from one another and are not strong enough to hold but very little weight.  They can be filled about half full of soft items with no sharp corners and very light weight.  Then if handled very carefully might hold together long enough to get them into the trash receptacle.  These were a penny cheaper than my usual kitchen bags so I was keen on saving money.  Hah!  Many bags ended up in the trash themselves when they tore to pieces.  Others were double bagged to manage to be usable.  I will not buy what turned out to be very expensive bags again.
1,Yuck.
1,Usable but broken up.
1,Our dog likes these but when ordered online instead of in store they came all pretty much into small broken pieces or crumbs.
1,These were stale and bland.  They're also an awkward, too large size.  The flavor they have is nice but they need a little more.  I didn't care for the texture but I couldn't tell if it's the brand or Amazon sent me an old/stale product.  I wouldn't recommend these, especially since they have almost no vitamins and minerals.  They're really just a sugary snack without the vitamins.
1,I thought this would make a nice snack.  Wrong.  Not much flavor and they were extremely salty.  Had to toss them.
1,So these wipes are great in terms of gentleness. The do not irritate any of my kids. HOWEVER, and its a big however, they are never folded properly and thus do not come out of the wipe warmer easily. This is dreadful when cleaning a diaper mess! They also leave lots of lint behind on babys bottom. Ultimately, Ive switched to Kirklands unscented wipes.
1,vanity fair is the only decent brand. These are thin, thinner than toilet paper practically, and are annoyingly cheap.  No way you can eat daintily with these.  Ribs would be a disaster.
1,I do not like these sponges at all!  I thought I would give them a try bc my regular sponges were not offerered in Amazon prime. The "scrubber" part is awful!  It barely works from the start, and completely falls apart after minimal usage. Then you are left picking up little green pieces all over your dishes. These are also not as think as other sponges. I will never buy again. Horrible!
1,Most of Stacy's chips are tasty but I would rather eat cardboard than these chips.
1,I will not buy canned chicken again.  I had a recipe that called for it, so I bought it with the thinking that it would be more convenient than buying and cooking a chicken.  While it was convenient, I was disappointed.  When I opened the can, it smelled like tuna.  It did not taste like tuna in the dish I made, but when my husband came home, he thought I made something with tuna because of the smell.  I also did not like the texture of the meat, and my husband commented on this as well.  While I'm sure this is a good enough brand, it's just not up to par and cannot compare with real chicken.
1,just ok
1,Natural flavor or not, green apple is a yucky one.
1,I cant put my finger on it but mine had a funky taste to it
1,yuck, no flavor, taste like salted cardboard
1,Ordered four boxes...don't ask why!  Arrived old, stale and one box all pies were moldy. Another box had some moldy ones.	Probably frozen in warehouse.. Filling was very dark...they were ruined, because didn't expire till 2017!
1,Tastes artificial.
1,VERY SMALL BOX.
1,They came stuck together. I was disappointed.
1,Arrived crushed.
1,These shells suck!	Sorry but they are only good for staying in place while you fill them up but the moment you take a bite the completely break!
1,it was rancid
1,I do not like these sponges at all!  I thought I would give them a try bc my regular sponges were not offerered in Amazon prime. The "scrubber" part is awful!  It barely works from the start, and completely falls apart after minimal usage. Then you are left picking up little green pieces all over your dishes. These are also not as think as other sponges. I will never buy again. Horrible!
1,I was really disappointed. I tried a small amount before using and spit it out. I tossed the entire contents away. It was really bad.
1,They don't have a super strong scent, and my trash can still smells.
1,Nasty old taste.
1,the whole box was crushed
1,Not sold. I'd recommend squash spaghetti instead if you don't want pasta.
1,Ordered 1 four can pack , only received 1 can .
1,this arrived damaged, the box was broken open and the crackers were crushed.
1,The selection of teas is somewhat strange, and I didn't like most of them, although I love to try new teas. Also very pricey.
1,THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT PACKAGED WELL.  ARRIVED WITH A PEPSI FIZZING AND IT MADE A MESS IN MY KITCHEN.  I GAVE THE REST TO A FRIEND.  I WILL NOT TRY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.
1,Note it says 24 doublesize 12.  Rolls are the same size as other toilet paper.
1,its sitting next to my chair, and i cant smell it at all, ever.
1,Watery
1,If all you want to taste is horribly overwhelming cinnamon, this is the tea for you! Personally, I'm gonna give it away or throw it away. Gross gross gross.
1,did not work well. Messy
1,New favor that was not too great tasting.  Arrived without any damage and delivery was on time.  Most likely will not order again.
1,Very wet mascara.  Even after wiping brush with tissue before application, the mascara deposited way too much product that quickly transfered to skin.  The stiff rubbery brush doesn't grip each individual lash, so it actually clumps more - without lengthening - leaving me with shorty spikey lashes.  Tossed this one and went back to my standby.
1,The smallest bag of treats Ive ever bought! Make sure you know this is only a 5oz bag of mini biscuits! Lol
1,To much for what you get and it did not have a good taste
1,They tear really really easily... Not a fan of having pieces of cotton stuck in my bum
1,a thin tomato paste somehow I was expecting tomato chunks
1,One doesn't expect something labeled as salted caramel to have cinnamon in it. They tasted good, until I needed allergy medication to help with my swelling.
1,I don't know when Gillette changed the overall design of this razor, because I did stop using Venus for some time, but the quality is severely lacking. As a woman who has shaved daily for 20+ years and has used this before, its very clear to me it is no longer the same design or quality it used to be. Make sure and order you some bandages if you get this razor, youll need them from the copious amounts of blood that will be streaming down your legs. Gillete, never again!
1,wont buy again.
1,I'm not much of a fan of excessive goo in my food. This cheesy tuna melt blend is a bit heavier on the sauce than what I would incorporate into a tuna snack.		This snack kit comes with a package of six crackers, one 2.75 ounce can of cheesy tuna melt flavored tuna mix, sealed with an easy-to-remove, tabbed, foil lid, and a little flat plastic spoon-shaped thing to spread the snack.		The flavor is thick, beyond my own liking. The snack pack satisfies hunger for a little bit. I almost wanted to rate it three stars, as being "alright," but considering I have no desire to have another, I suppose a two-star "I don't like it" is in order for my particualr review.		As a portable snack, Bumble Bee Snack On The Run is an exceptionally convenient option, having everything needed to enjoy the snack while on the go included.		This is for people who find a saucey tuna snack appealing. I tend to like my tuna blends to balance out at the point at which the tuna is incorporated just enough that it is not dry.
1,sorry but family disliked.
1,Not ad big as expected
1,This was okay. Not the greatest .
1,i love all the udi products i've tried .. breads, frozen entrees, but these cookies don't make our list.  there are other gluten free brands out there that i prefer.  i would not purchase them again.
1,I thought that this flaked coconut would be finer, maybe more shredded..I didn't mind the fact it was unsweetened, but I found it did not have much flavor and it  was much larger pieces.. more like it was chipped.. and I really don't know what to do with it now that I have it..Don't think I will order it again..
1,Funky taste kids did not like.  I liked the price and the number of vitamins in the bottle.  But if they hate them, I won't buy them again.
1,Dry and gross, threw away
1,Some people may care for it, but not me.
1,These smell like vinegar or something-super weird paper towels to me. not like normal texture either and very small rolls....not buying again
1,Very little flavor and they all taste the same.  Will not order these again.
1,I found they were to hard and small.
1,Product was damaged and outdated. Very disappointed.
1,worst product ever purchased...bad smell...bad taste...just plan out BAD!
1,Not like they use to be...  too hard.
1,Turns out I'm allergic to something in the product.
1,These are disgusting.
1,The tip on these Q-tips is thin and the therefore you feel the stick part a lot more. I figured they would be softer because they are for babies...my mistake.
1,melt in mouth ones work quicker
1,Way too hot and we like hot and spicy snack foods esp. nuts. We couldn't eat them and tossed most of them away after having tried to rinse the spice off of them and then re-crisp them. $6 down the drain.
1,I am sure there is nothing wrong with the product itself but it simply did not meet my expectations.  I expected coconut sugar to have at least a slight taste of coconut and at least a slight sweetness of sugar.  Well, I was wrong on both accounts.  This product has zero sweetness and zero coconut flavor.  It's dark brown in color.  In my opinion, it looks, smells, and taste like very finely ground bitter graham cracker crumbs.  Again, this product is new to me so I assume a more experienced chef would know to expect this.  However, if you are expecting something more like coconut infused sugar, this is not the product for you.
1,Not crazy about the taste.
1,stale dry
1,This toilet paper was a bust in our house. It is very thin, rips easy and the rolls aren't very good.
1,Weird..........threw several away.
1,nice looking razors doesnt mean they shave well,maybe its me but my face feels raw and rough after the second shave.not really ordering again.
1,Tasted stale
1,Could've been worse...
1,Not impressed, I'll stick with ramen... not worth the price
1,Terrible taste.
1,Flavor is okay -- but not great.  Not good enough for a second purchase.  Regular salted nuts dipped in sriracha would actually be better.
1,I am having one heck of a time finding some gravy mix that is edible.  I used to buy powdered gravy mix in a bulk canister at the warehouse club place (the one named after some guy responsible for the mega chain) that was fantastic, but they quit selling it.  I can't make decent gravy from scratch like my mama used to because I do not have the greasy drippings needed, and I have tried using butter but it ends up tasting like a cream sauce rather than gravy.  This one had an unidentifiable "off flavor" that lingered in the mouth.  We added some freshly cooked sausage to try to cover it, but that didn't work.  It simply ruined the sausage!  I've tried a couple of other brands that were not any better.  One of them had a *shiver* minty taste which was really disgusting! IF I find one that just tastes like what cream gravy (AKA: milk gravy, country gravy, white gravy...) is supposed to taste like without any weird whangs or hints of something that just doesn't belong, I will update.
1,If you love drinking your water with a wedge of lemon, don't imagine for a moment this beverage will be anything like that. I bought this lemon water and also the grape variety, and they're both awful. I'm not particularly put off by the idea of artificial flavors or sweeteners, since I already drink a wide variety of calorie-free brands; but the people at Nestle need to go back to the lab to figure out why they can't seem to get their chemicals to result in a decent-tasting beverage. Terrible!
1,This doesn't dissolve..put it in a bowl overnight to see..YET I've found a great way to use it. IN THE DISHWASHER DISPENSER. I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT AND HAVE THE 'CHEAP" DISHWASHER. I DON'T USE IT OFTEN; USING THE CRYSTALS REALLY HELPS CLEAN where the water drains. Laundry..cleaning..it just won't dissolve....even putting it in a drain overnight....
1,were stale but worked as expected, little more expensive then brick and mortar stores, but hey, front door delivery.
1,Very sweet ,serving is 6-8 teaspoons per 4-6 ounce cup. I wouldn't buy this again..
1,I took a chance on this item in my Prime Pantry box. I figured, I love peanuts and salted caramel, how can I go wrong? I miscalculated badly. There is a plastic, not quite caramel after burn to these that I find really unpleasant. Also, I immediately tasted the cinnamon. I don't like cinnamon and would never have bought these had I known that was an ingredient. Not sure why you need cinnamon in a product that is billed as salted caramel.		I'd never buy these again. If they are reading, I hope the people at the Kraft Heinz food lab realize that even if you can cook it up in a lab, fake=fake.
1,kids prefer the version with sugar
1,it has bad ingridients
1,Very disappointing.  Tastes stale and is very dry and crumbly.  I can't even eat it because it crumbles into bits and becomes powdery, causing me to choke.
1,When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!
1,Love these chips but will not order again because bag popped open and chips were broken.
1,Way too small.
1,Not really suited for my dark n lovely complexion :/
1,Would not buy again. I suspect it has hidden msg from the labeling. When they fail to name the spice "spices" that's usually the reason.
1,I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit.  I've used it in Bloody Marys and added a few drops to many dishes I wanted to "kick up" a notch.		I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently. Huge mistake!		After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!		I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,  Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce are all far superior. There are many others		Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are a lot of superior hot sauces. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco was first developed.		Update (August 2013): While my review was written some time ago - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces. What sauce came in last? Tabasco! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.
1,Received four double boxes and three single boxes.  Ordered one.
1,I guess this one is a fail for the Keurig machine. It really doesn't even taste like cider
1,These things are so tiny and thin, I have to use three at a time. They don't stick very well either.
1,Didn't like the flavour
1,Wasn't what I expected.
1,It would have been great, but watch what you order with heavier items.  Soda/Water crushed many items. Wasn't packed well.
1,thought the smell was nice at first, but by the end of the day it smelled really bad. I am a woman, but at the end of the day I felt like I started smelling a little too "manly". I wore it 2-3 times before just giving up and throwing it out. I'm disappointed because I have been happy with other "Tom's" products. I will be going back to the Apricot version of this, which I like a lot. It's fruity, but it's not too bad. As far as protection goes, just like any other aluminum-free deodorant you can expect to have to re-apply by the end of the day, especially if you are active. However, I've tried a variety of different ones and this one does seem to be the longest-lasting and does the best job. I still find that my armpits get a little wet at times, especially if i have a presentation or something, so I try to switch off days depending on my stress or activity level. Although I definitely noticed that the first week or so was the worst and after that my body started to adjust to not having all of those chemicals blocking my sweat ducts. Now the deodorant works better.
1,Gross. Had a few cups, gave the rest away.
1,Not at all as pictured. 80% almonds. 15% cashews 5% other nuts. And why no Brazil nuts? If you are lucky you might get 4 pecans. Disapointing.
1,Smaller than expected.
1,tastes worse than bad breath
1,smashed
1,Not as fresh as the ones I get at the local store.
1,Not as effective as most store brands. Will not buy again, wish I had bought a smaller bottle.
1,To sweet. No like real Lemons.
1,i'll pass on this.
1,Too soft, rolls too small.
1,Not that great...
1,It fell off all the time. Put it on my garbage cans. Didn't notice when the first or second fell in. Got maybe two weeks of use.
1,I was initially very excited for these but they get pretty dried out. :/ was not very thrilled by this. Sorry Rachel Ray, still love ya
1,honestly it tastes like a melted orange ice pop.  not tasty at all.
1,It's too stiff.	I feel like I'm scratching my teeth, not brushing.	Not matter how cheap the product is, I'm not gonna buy this again.		But it was good to use when some biscuit stuck on my wisdom tooth.
1,This product is not what I expected.  This tuna as not as white as expected.  It is brownish.  The 4 oz. cans of tuna differ ... the tuna is white, fresh and smells delicious.
1,note the best coffee ive ever had.
1,My family loves bacon, maple syrup on their pancakes and breakfast meat and I cannot keep enough popcorn. In stock for them. I thought this would be fun and a mix of all American things loved. However, they were not fond of this at all.  The powder flavoring was very gritty they said it was a little more smoky than expected. They used the popcorn and the movie theater butter it also comes with and skipped out on the flavoring. Maybe I'll use it on a cupcake or something. My family ages are 16 9 2 35 and 31. Not a fan. The packaging is really cute and the bucket is definitely handy to shake it all in. A cute gift but select another flavor. I'm thinking this would be an aquire taste.
1,This tasted so off to me - like it had gone bad (even though the expiration date was nearly a year away).  Arizona's honey tea tastes a lot better.  I will not buy this again.  I can't understand all of the 4 and 5 star reviews.  To each his own.
1,Don't buy this you can get it for less.
1,price a typo? over $10 for a half-size bag of chips? check others nearby, any brand: twice as much about $2.25
1,I would know...
1,Didn't like them at all.
1,Nothing wrong with the shipment, just didn't think they tasted very good
1,I was so surprised by the size of thee package. Dogs not even interested.
1,disliked the taste, so did my family
1,too sweet for me BUT does help my BBQ sauce taste great
1,I bought these for the mix of nuts.  And you get a mix of nuts, but EVERYTHING tastes like peanuts.  Pecans taste like peanuts, filberts taste like peanuts, etc.  You can barely tell one kind of nuts from another.  I won't be buying these again.
1,This is screwed up. Trying g to review the chefboyardee and the picture of the olive oil shows up. Computer error.
1,The packaging was okay but the contents were in crumbles.
1,Totally unimpressed would not waste my money again not enough flavor just not tasty to me
1,This size is INCREDIBLY small.  About the height of a "D" size battery, and the width of 3 or 4 of them stacked side by side.  For the price, I will not be ordering this again.
1,Tastes good but after reading the ingredients and my own health struggles I highly recommend you make your own frostings and cake mixes and avoid these. The convenience and low prices with good taste have been fine or so I thought over the years but my autoimmune and allergies issues have made me more careful out of necessity to limit flares and even migraine triggers the last few years. These highly preserved chemically rich and manipulated instant options are terrible for my health and my family seems to have far less digestion issues since we started making our own baked treats and knowing exactly what we put in our body's for energy is essential to our family health and happiness. If you Read and google ingredients in products like this and decide how much your family and your healths worth with these cheap options like I have ive found it's risking alot to just to decorate a birthday cake. Not everyone can afford organic but go simple and natural. Winco bulk items are cheaper than even these instant classics and you don't need to add 20 chemical softeners, preservatives and plastics to make a nice frosting. Ask your relatives or make it a fun family activity to spend time together mastering the right treats and you'll be better able to live with the right options for your health and your family's.
1,The peanut butter has syrup in it. I expected better from GoPicnic.
1,Meh. One can cooked correctly, the next one under the same circumstances didn't crisp properly. Ended up not very good.
1,I was not impressed by the taste. I won't be buying these again.
1,These did not go over so well.  The caramel flavor just didn't hit the mark of making you want more.
1,I did not like the flavor despite all the good reviews I read it's not like the box Kraft macaroni that I'm used to. First of all you add water not milk. Secondly, nuking it had a major effect on the consistency and texture of the noodles. Will likely give the entire box away or throw them away as my kiddos didn't even like it.
1,2 thick n dry
1,Tasted way too sour. Not what I expected
1,Do not buy these wipes, they smell awful. I used these to clean a spill and now I cannot even sit in the room. The smell is making me sick to my stomach. I expect more from Seventh Generation. What a waste.
1,It tasted stalel!
1,meh, I guess I don't like this one.  It has a cumbersome plastic thing on top that has to be opened and then dig into the packet through that for a wipe.  Also, I do not believe these wipes are clean and surely would not use on baby hand OR face; first two wipes I pulled out had hair on them??
1,This was basically sugar with a side of coffee. Pretty bad in my opinion.
1,Avoid the excess sugars and flatulence by avoiding this can of "food".
1,Very displeased that this was ONE bowl, not EIGHT as described. I paid more for this one bowl of cake, than I would have at the store! VERY UNHAPPY. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.
1,Gross
1,Stale, threw them in the garbage.
1,My husband said it felt and smelled weird. Like the smell of plastic. Said left him oily too.
1,Too many chemicals.
1,very disappointed
1,I'm not happy with these compared to the ones you purchase in-store. I normally buy these from target when they go on sale, aside from them being  much smaller rolls than I find locally. They just don't have the same feel or even the same thickness that I'm used to. The texture is even different. I can see the reason for most of the positive reviews, these still are better than the average paper towel, but if you're not familiar with the ones I find at retail locally, you might think they are "normal". I'm aware maybe I got an 'off" batch of them, but I won't risk buying them again and the price really isn't close to any deal if you compare to how much more you get in the larger rolls for pretty much the same if not a lower price. And the consistency I get in the stores are a much softer feel and seem "fluffier". I'm a fan of the product but not this version of it.
1,The expiration was only three days away once delivered. The food product was dry and actually hard. We couldn't eat this and it wasn't allowed to be returned. This actually happened to MOST of the food items in my order. What a waste of money. It all went into the trash. So upset about this. I will never order food from online again.
1,The squeezable jelly is a not effective.  Ultimately you open up the lid and scoop out the jelly with a knife,
1,Gross
1,Nunca llego a la direccion que se solicito y no me devuelven mi dinero
1,I bought these cuz they were much cheaper than my regular brand.  Never again.	I did not like the texture or taste.
1,Gross.  I love pastas of all sorts but this is disgusting.
1,Not much on flavor.  It may be good for ya...
1,Too small of a jar, hard to get out and do not like the texture.
1,threw it out. awful
1,poorly conceived and executed, you'll find more coconut / chocolate satisfaction, sadly, in a Mounds bar.	don't bother with this disaster.....
1,They made her sick.
1,nasty nasty nasty no flavor and stale as hell
1,hate it sorry
1,I was disappointed in this soup. The flavor was flat and spices kicked in only as an aftertaste. This is one of the few Progresso soups I don't care for.
1,Yeah, pretty gross.  I guess it's a matter of taste, but I'm not buying this again.
1,Has a weird fake taste. Love the jasmine and I usually love mint, so I figured this would be a winner. My whole family agrees this one tastes icky. My daughter grows mint out front (it's her baby) and adding that to tea is wonderful, but this one is not tase-tea at all. Get the jasmine, that is really good! Lemongrass is a step down from the jasmine one. The straight green tea is a bit more bitter than them all.
1,I didn't like it, maybe you do ( your stomach has to be stronger than mine)
1,I couldn't stand the taste, taste like seltzer water.
1,I thought this was Rice Krispy cereal, not little rice krispy treats loaded with sugar!  The label on the box is a little misleading with the "Treats" portion of the label written in cereal, so you can easily miss it.  If you are looking just for the cereal, this is not it!
1,Looked good but it was the worse tasting items I have ever bought! I'll stick with TG Friday's.
1,Ugh, not a fan of these chips. They tasted stale and were too thick. I ended up tossing most of the bag because no one else in the house liked them. Sometimes healthier is simply not tasty enough.
1,Just put 90 calories of sugar in some type of bubbly water, and a couple drops of cola flavor, it tastes like a drink of coke after the ice melts in  regular coke.
1,Didn't see that it was coconut scented. Not for me.
1,Some of the stew cans were old with green mold which apparently exploded during shipment covering the other  items and the box with the green mold and contents.  This was shipped to my brother in college and he apparently thought one item was ok and got a bad case of food poisoning, vomiting for a week, We had to discard the shipment.  Obviously, the stew was too old and should not have been shipped in the first place.
1,This does not taste like lemon to me.  It's too sweet and the artificial flavor is too strong.  I added some plain water to it, and it was not too bad.  However, who wants to have to play mix master with bottled water.  I won't buy this again.  If you are thinking this will taste like water when you add a slice of lemon to your glass, it doesn't.
1,Tastes funny to me. Not like the ketchup I grew up with, and I am real curious as to why. I've always loved the vinegar taste in Heinz, but something is just off with this stuff. It doesn't taste bad, just not normal, which is disappointing considering that this version should be healthier for consumers than their HFCS non-Organic versions.
1,I was very disappointed in these paper towels.  They are so small that the whole pack should cost maybe $3. They were half the size of any normal roll I've purchased from Target.  I will not purchase these again...very deceiving.
1,Its like vasaline in a tube. Ugh! And it is sticky.
1,too sweet
1,leaves streaks like it was made to.
1,This was sort of a disappointment, something like those kid lunches with all the little sides. There weren't many plantain chips and they were sort of dry and flavorless. The dip was essentially refried beans with a bit of chili powder.
1,This did not pack well .........it is flat....I love this product but, to have it shipped is not ideal
1,Waaaay too sweet for me.
1,Most of the cookies were broken up.
1,Good flavor but absolutely awful to try and get out of pans. Followed direction exactly and what a mess. We ended up just pulling it out of the pan and eating it then had to soak pans good to get them clean again.
1,Bent cans damaged with broken glass and picked juices
1,Box was busted so ashamed I don't do non quality food
1,This does have all the fiber you need in it but unfortunately it tastes horrible.
1,absolutely horrible taste . I couldn't give this flavor away.
1,Sweet, and more sweet. Flavor? Not so much. I won't repeat the experiment.
1,The super jumbo kidney beans!!! half the can was kidney beans! Yuck! This may have OK if there were no beans.
1,My husband loves this soup but I hated it, it has a very strong onion taste that I don't like.
1,smashed
1,It's really chemically tasting and just bland overall.
1,I'll finish the box but it's really boring.  It's like eating a crunched up granola bar.
1,I liked both the roasted garlic and the herb & butter flavored varieties of this same product but found the four cheese flavor to be sickeningly very artificial and unpleasant, and in no way resembling anything close to being cheese flavored. I had to seriously "doctor up" the four cheese potatoes with seasonings of my own just to make it edible.
1,This is the third can I've ordered and the quality is poor. The first can was fine although it contained mostly almonds. The second can was great with a good assortment with a clean appearance and good taste. In the third can about half of the nuts were broken and many just small fragments of their original size. Bits of nut skins covering the nuts gave a very dirty appearance although they didn't affect the overall taste. The nuts didn't have a 'fresh' taste and came across as a bit stale. Planters doesn't seem to have any quality control on it's products and I'll be ordering from another company.
1,Not impressed
1,Tastes good, but this product has MSG! Yuck!
1,Milk in order exploding ruining this, unable to determine quality.
1,It was way too hard to chew almost unpleasurable.
1,In case anyone's interested, this puff corn contains GMOs. This isn't reflected on Amazon's product image; I discovered it on a bag I bought locally. This is really a shame, as I love these things.		Also, the price printed on the bag is $2.00. Amazon is currently selling it for $2.75. What's up with that?
1,Not "sweet" enough for my taste
1,Wasn't crazy about the taste and each time I received the package it was melted so won't be buying again.
1,the flavor is OFF. Not a fan, won't be buying again, organic or not...this was not good.
1,It doesn't persist long time.
1,Sadly it is my desperate greed that made me buy this. Oh god is it stale we are better off with frozen stuff.
1,Not impressed. I like Kettle Brand chips, but I did not dig this flavor. They tasted kind of bland.
1,The product said it was 2. I only got 1. Too expensive for only 1. I order this bz it said 2 . Small and expensive
1,You know those packing peanuts you use to get in boxes? Ok, so get one of those, add some color to it, flatten it a little and you have these.  SO not a good taste. No one at all has liked these. I've begged people to take them off of my hands.
1,Other sensitive toothpastes keep teeth feeling cleaner longer.
1,Didn't read ingredients - has port
1,Cleans okay but the smell is unpleasant, strong and long lasting on your skin. I can't believe it was even put on the market smelling this bad! Disappointed.
1,Good flavor, really generous bag, but the pita itself was not what I expected.  I think this is not a measure of quality, but personal taste.  So I would not re-purchase, but I would certainly go back to the brand itself again.
1,I used to order this product once a week and loved it and now sadly its no longer available for amazon prime and if you see it the price is so high its just crazy.  What a pity
1,Normally I love these, but the last batch I got tasted like they had been burned.  Yuck!  I don't know if it was just that batch or what, but I don't think I will be buying these again.
1,I usually love breakfast flats but I couldn't hardly finish any of these. They have that sour oat taste and are very hard to chew.
1,Does nothing
1,The taste was okay but I could not get it to stay mixed well.
1,has alcohol sugar which causes blindness. Why oh WHY cant they must make it with stevia.
1,Gross as hell.. Taste more like salsa and cardboard.
1,These seemed to taste just okay but were too plain and made my throat hurt. Of course, this could also be because they were expired. I seriously didn't expect Amazon to sell expired stuff but, oh well. Probably not buying again.
1,looks wonderful, smells really good.  dogs turned their noses up and wouldn't touch it.  oh well.  my babies are picky
1,Don't waste your money!
1,Try again, last attempt review vaporized.	What IS IT about this lotion that feels like you coated your skin in plastic and looks that way also?	Have the heavy, greasy cream does not do that but is not hand cream.	I will stay with Excipal brand strong suggestion by dermatologist.  TYVM.	Amazon has Excipal, btw.
1,It don't clean my clothes well.....
1,Very disappointing.  I enjoy salty foods (despite health risks...), but these chicken noodle soups are way too salty. The first couple of spoonfuls really hit home with the excessive amount of salt content. Furthermore, the noodles texture is on the rubbery side. Despite enjoying  chunky soup products, I would not purchase this variety again.
1,The first ingredient is sugar and it has a lot of artificial stuff. I threw it away. It is very unhealthy. It does taste good but the sugar and the artificial ingredients give it a one star.
1,I like their "expert" version called "intense repair" but this basic version is cheap and watered down in comparison
1,It tastes disgusting!
1,its ok
1,Not like they used to be at all.
1,Taste of most of these flavors are crunchy cardboard... the cereal flavors are all delicious but the rest are eh!
1,Disappointing mix of nuts overall. Bought 4 of these, and have opened 3 so far. The cans are probably 90%+ Peanuts and Almonds. My wife likes Brazil nuts most, and in the first container there was only 2 of them. The second container had ZERO. The third container had 3 and 1/2 of them. Extremely disappointing. For Pecans there have been an average of 8-10 halves per can. Cashews have a bit more, maybe around 20 of them per can.		Overall the nuts have a good flavor. A lot of the almonds are toasted well, and the flavor really comes through. Just don't buy these cans unless you are fine getting mostly Peanuts and Almonds. Picking out a Cashew or Pecan is a pleasant surprise, not a regular occurrence. And if you manage to find a Brazil nut it's like finding one of Wonka's Golden Tickets.
1,Dry, crumbly, stale seeming. No chocolate flavor. Will not buy them again.
1,It smells good in the box but not on my clothes I just wasted five dollars on this junk
1,This package was darker than any other package I havep[urchased. Not just one sleeve but every sleeve  in the box, was over cooked and not great.
1,So they put a fancy name on it and put it in a nice can and as far as I can see it is the exact same product as the Hershey's Cocoa we've all been buying for the last 100 years.  Not that it's bad, it's just absolutely not worth twice the price as I can't see a single difference other than the packaging.  (Saying it's "Hershey's" is not a metaphor, the can says Sharffen Berger is "a division of Hershey's Confectionary Corp." )  The taste and texture are identical as far as I can tell.
1,Can dented.
1,I thought this was regular printer paper..it is  it. Thick, fewer pieces in the team. Hard to use in home printer. Bad description!!!
1,Awful worst mascara ever does not add  volume makes lashes stick together and look thinner... awful so disappointed,  plastic applicator  have to wait and layer and layer and UGH......
1,ucky
1,Good, but oily
1,The bar was tender and moist.  It was a nice size for a snack.  That being said, why the 2 star was:		Taste.  It was cloying to me.  Not of sweet but the over all taste of what they termed cheesecake and salted caramel.  It just wasn't good. I had the desire to rinse my mouth and brush my teeth to get rid of the taste.  I've eaten good cheesecake and bad cheesecake and this wasn't cheesecake it was like some illegitimate version of a cheesecake crossed with a cheese danish crossed with a piece of hardtack.  I felt like I had a film on my teeth and mouth when I was done eating it.		Texture.  It was well... grainy and chalky.  I'm not sure how it managed both but that was the texture.		It's the first time a treat has taken me 45 minutes to eat.  And I need my head examined for doing that.  That was my stupidity.  But now I'm looking at 9 of them and wondering how in the devil I am going to pawn them off on some unsuspecting soul and if I should.		I could have had an apple with 4.4 grams fiber and about 95 calories [med size] vs this for 150 calories and 5 grams of fiber.  And I hate apples.  That's telling you something if my first  thought after finishing it was "I could have had an apple.  It would have tasted so much better."		That being said, you may love it and find the taste suits you.  Our tastebuds are different.  That's why we like different foods.  I'm just telling you what I found and suggesting you taste one before you buy a 10 package box.		 I foresee unless someone really likes them, this is going to have a LONG shelf life at my house.  Edited to add:  Hallelujah! My sister will take them [and the Brownies if it turns out I don't like them too.]  She loves them.  That is what I mean by different tastes.
1,These have no taste whatsoever  - not of almond or any other nut or of any flavor.  Very sorry I bought them and don't recommend them.  Blue Diamond can do better than this.
1,Terrible greasy eyebrow pencil. Barely has ANY color. Is rock hard. If I paid more I would def return it. DO not buy this pencil. You would be better off going to Dollar General or a flea market.
1,They are too strong as the bandage leaves a lot of sticky residue when you try to remove it and the residue is difficult to remove.
1,Yuck. Tastes like little cardboard nuggets.  Lacking flavor or even a hint of fat which is always good (in moderation) on popcorn.  These were tossed out after no one in my family of 7 would eat more than one, so they lingered for weeks in the snack drawer and who likes that?  I'd definitely advise skipping these cute little sacks--they just don't deliver the Tasty.
1,not good for me, I sweat too much, if you aren't too active you will probably like but if you sweat alot from hard work it probably won't work for you. On upside it smells nice.
1,The actual soap product was okay, it cleaned well without drying hands. However, it was thin and shot out of all of my soap dispensers wasting product. My biggest problem with this purchase was the size, it was pretty small in comparison to other similar products at that price point. If you do buy, however, pour slowly because it comes out fast!
1,These have nuts in them - not listed in the description.
1,Smell was overwhelming, didn't work very well as far as taking care of dry skin.
1,Doesn't keep you dry like I had hoped
1,It's too bitter.  I can't even add it to juice to blunt the taste.  Ugh.
1,stale tasting not the same as in the stores.
1,Blech!  The peanuts tasted yucky.  Gave it a try, and now I know.  The concept sounds delicious, but reality = eck!  :(
1,For reasons known only to Krusteaz, and maybe a few conspiracy theorists, this mix only makes NINE muffins.  Who the heck came up with this idea?  And I could almost forgive that super strange situation if the muffins were good, but these simply aren't.  They're dense, pasty, and way too sweet, especially for an oat bran muffin.  We adore the Krusteaz blueberry muffin mix, which, incidentally, makes a dozen muffins instead of only nine, but we won't be buying the oat bran again.
1,The worst Campbells soup ever.  Just plain nasty and I love most Campbells soups..
1,Not tasty
1,Would have been better if it had more dog meat
1,It's too weak. You get what you pay for.
1,It arrived in perfect condition. I was hoping to like this water. The date wasn't old, but the added baking soda, calcium chloride, and magnesium sulphate give it an "off" and salty taste. Not refreshing. Felt thirstier afterwards.  Rather than return it I will use it to rinse my hair, which is better than our tap water here.  If Nestle' has a product with just water, I'll buy it.
1,Won't order this again will stick with the Clam Chowder
1,Tastes like public bathroom deodorizer smells. No, thanks.
1,Bright neon green is the warning you get before buying this new formula. Take the previous mountain dew and add the flavor of chalk and a bit of child's play clay to create this flat soda. I had already switched the the "Throw Back" flavor when I wanted a treat. But at some places such as restaurants and machines, you can only find the basic Mtn. Dew. I noticed the colors on the package (the new green), but didn't know the formula was different until I took a swig. Worst thing to happen to the Mountain Dew since corn syrup. Now it isn't as good as the knock-off store brands, to me.
1,My wife and I were thrilled when we heard that there was a soda with Stevia used for a sweetner, instead of dangerous Aspartame or other artificial sweetners.  We went down to our local health food store, where we purchased several different flavors of 'Zevia', including their cola.  Imagine our surprise when we read one of the ingredients listed as erythritol, a sugar alcohol!  And then we learned that it very well could be made from GMO (genetically modified) corn!  Our quest for a truly natural, non GMO, stevia only soda continues!
1,UPDATE3  Went back to cascade and have had no problems since.		UPDATE2 My dishwasher leaked all over the floor. We looked and looked and finally found bits of plastic stuck in the drain at the bottom of the machine and even in the holes in the washer arms. I couldn't figure out where it could have come from. Well today I washed my dishes again with one of these tablets. It didn't dissolve completely. The plastic that was left stuck in the cup looked exactly like what I had found clogging the machine. I'm done with these for sure now even though I hate throwing out this expensive product. It would be much more expensive if it totally clogged the motor.		UPDATE The reason the dishes didn't get clean was because the dishwasher packet didn't dissolve. I dried the dishwasher holder thoroughly. I hope that the whole box off cleaners isn't ruined. I put them in a dry place. I wrote the company and they gave me the "you're water's probably not hot enough". Not true. I also used the water heater boost on my dishwasher. I can see the other tablets are appearing to break down. I have them stored in  dry place and I make sure the holder in the dishwasher is perfectly dry and my hands are dry when I touch the tablets. These might work ok someplace where there is no humidity.		I have only used this once, but it works better than the other type of one piece dishwasher detergent. I've used two of the other name brands and I left my dishes dirtier than normal when I used this one and it cleaned better than the others.		UPDATE The  second time I used these I didn't scrape all the food residue from my dishes. The directions said it wasn't necessary. I will probably need to soak and clean the dishes then re-wash them. This didn't work as well as prior products I've used. The first load I washed I had already made sure there was no remaining food. The food this left on seems like it shouldn't have been that hard to get off. Nothing burned on just small amounts of things like spaghetti sauce and peanut butter.
1,This is extremely overpriced
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,CDM Coffee plus Chickory was unlike any coffee I have ever tasted before.  I didn't care for it at all and after making it two times, I threw it out.
1,I can't use this at all.  My skin breaks out in a rash....
1,just ok
1,Yuck. This tastes like bad Koolaid. Nasty flavor and nothing like blueberry. Red tea? I mean its very very red. How is that? Blueberry juice is clear. Not red certainly.		Nasty after taste too. This is more like a bad raspberry flavored tea. In fact, it is so far from blueberry I thought I got the wrong item and went back to check the box! Yogi is a lot better.
1,Great product! You get what you see.
1,COME ON NOW, ITS SOUP--CAMPBELLS
1,We love peanut M&M's, every so often I will pick up a bag when I find them at a good price.  This time we received a bad bag, so I was a bit disappointed. There were so many broken M&M's in this bag, and  quite a few naked peanuts in the bag (no candy shell or chocolate).  M&M's  were missing peanuts, and some peanuts had a horrible taste. It's as if the company scraped up whatever was left in the bottom of the bin and bagged it up for sale. I have received these before from Amazon and they were fresh, looked good, and tasted great.
1,First time and the last time.  Why bother making a product this bad?
1,did not last very long in night light
1,I have tried using this product multiple times now and every time the product somehow starts to sting my eyes even up to one hour after putting it on.  I don't put it near my eyes anymore than I have ever done with my other moisturizer (Clinique is what I'm used to) and I don't have a problem with stinging.  It didn't work for me..........
1,I bought these to tide me over until I could get my family-sized tub from Wegman's (their brand). They are NOT good. I remember what animal crackers used to taste like--nothing like this. I went to Wegman's and got my animal cookies. Love my low-fat snack that costs 10.00 for a 68 oz. tub. That will last a long time!
1,Dented
1,sounded so good, but didn't really like it
1,This works ok but doesn't tackle teen BO smell in clothes. My sons shirts still stink after a heavy cycle double wash in our front loader with this. We switched back to tide. With tide one normal wash and they are fresh so we save nothing and waste lots of water using this. If you have mild laundry issues this may be for you but if you have active teens, stains or other laundry issues this is a waste
1,I thought i was buying flavored water, but this is not water!!! It has sucralose in it! I don't consider sucralose to be a natural flavoring.
1,These are really crunchy... some people might like it for it... but be warned the crumbs are everywhere!! I was snacking on this in my car and it made my car so messy.
1,Not all that easy to prepare. (frosting especially)
1,The Grahams were not fresh, they were soft not crisp and didn't taste good at all. I had to throw away.
1,I hate to say this, but I did not like these cookies at all. Sadly, I usually love Chips Ahoy, but not this flavor.
1,ive seen several people use these and thought i should try it out. I should have stuck with the floss. Now i have several plastic flossing in my trash bin from a single use. depending on the way your teeth are you could be using from two to five. It states that the threading doesn't fall apart but they. i will be going back to regular floss after these are gone.	Other then that the pick works great. That's probably the only good thing from this floss. This floss needs some improvements.
1,I'll finish the box but it's really boring.  It's like eating a crunched up granola bar.
1,Lacking in flavor and consistency - watery and rather tasteless.
1,They are not very flavorful.  Just kind of bland.
1,My little Chihuahua really has to be in the mood to eat these. She used to love them, but now she'll either take a few bites or snub her nose and walk away. I don't think I'll be purchasing these again.
1,Not my favorite
1,got lipton because of using the bags.  I don't like this, you may.  It so fine it comes thru the keurig container and residue in you cup which doesn't taste so good.  I'll not buy it again.
1,flavor is kindof yucky
1,Makes a mess.not worth the effort.
1,Don't even, it's not worth it.
1,does not taste like shortbread
1,Not so long lasting.
1,forgot how dry and hard they were, always looking for low Calorie snacks, this did not fit the bill
1,Smashed, do not buy with ANYTHING heavy.  Also very limited expiration date.
1,all packaging and not much substance. overpriced
1,Wrong picture displayed, very disappointed; My favorite chips are the ones you replaced. Not buying ever again
1,It was spoiled by tge time I got it. Won't buy it again.
1,This was so bad I had to throw it out. Smelled like manure, and tasted like it too - I presume - never having drunk manure water.
1,Not anywhere near as good as the orange.
1,Black Cherry flavor is overpowering.
1,Way too sweet!  Overwhelming artificial taste.  I expected a light refreshing drink with a touch of lemon.  UGH.  Disgusting.
1,a huge disappointent; pretty, but not very functional either as a gentle cleaner or for leaving a nice scent in the room ... have used Method products in the past, but trying out three new scents has been a disappointment. They Are pretty though...
1,Omg this is the worst thing I think I've ever had for lunch! I love pad Thai. This looked alright, smelled alright, tasted terrible! I expected it to be a bit bland and definitely disappointing when conpaded to real pad Thai. But i figured for a few bucks maybe it would be an ok lunch. No. The noodles taste horrible. I think that is the source of the problem. I truly regret buying a few of these to try. Total waste of money.
1,yuk, tastes bad
1,Gave 2 stars because can good arrived dented.  I don't purchase or consume dented can items for health reasons and it was discarded.  However I have tasted item before and use in different recipes, enjoyed taste and texture.
1,Yuck. That is all.
1,Chips good, packaging was horrible
1,too sweet
1,Didn't like it at all
1,I do not see a difference in terms of drying with and without it. I also usually see residues in my cookware.
1,awwww, plain white napkins and they're thin. bummer. I was expecting a better quality napkin for Mardi Gras. A pattern of some sort would have made me happy. Ya get what cha pay for.
1,We've been using this detergent for a few years now and couldn't figure out why some of our laundered clothes smelled so bad when worn.		I did a test by smelling them straight from the washer vs fresh out of the dryer using a dryer sheet. The clothes from the dryer smelled great but the wet clothes smelled bad. Not disgustingly bad just slightly unpleasant. After air drying some of the laundry and putting it in a drawer for a week they smelled much worse.		For a long time I thought the smell came from one of my dresser drawers (the one I put delicates in that I air dry) and began buying some products that you put in your drawers to take away musty smells. They didn't help much.		Needless to say I won't be buying this product any longer.
1,too sweet!
1,Tried to cook Persian-style (similar to Indian/Afghan) and it didn't work. Ended up the same way Chinese jasmin would.
1,Don't care for the taste.
1,Want to put a little high fructose corn syrup on your meat?  Then buy this bbq sauce.  This is a sweet BBQ sauce. However, nutritionists and doctors recommend staying away from high fructose corn syrup and this sauce lists it as the first ingredient. Why is HFCS bad for you? Here's what a cardiologist says:		"High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a type of sugar that has been processed and combined with corn syrup to produce a cheap, easily dissolvable sweetener. But this sugar is quickly absorbed by the liver where it is converted into fat. Since your brain doesn't recognize HFCS as regular food, it never shuts off the appetite center -- so you keep eating. Blood sugar levels rise, massive amounts of insulin is recruited to metabolize it and then you crash and feel hungry again. It is found in soft drinks, fruit juices, salad dressings and baked goods. Read the food labels of products in your pantry and refrigerator and throw out all products that contain HFCS."		 A family member bought this brand without reading the label, so we'll be throwing it out. Too much corn syrup does nasty things to your body - there are BBQ Sauces which are healthier. This one lists it as a primary ingredient:		High Fructose Corn Syrup, Distilled Vinegar, Tomato Paste, Modified Food Starch, contains less than 2% of: Salt, Pineapple Juice Concentrate, Natural Smoke Flavor, Spices, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate as a preservative, Molasses, Corn Syrup, Garlic,* Sugar, Tamarind, Natural Flavor.		If you only like sweet BBQ sauces, then they may be high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup. There are tangier sauces which contain no high fructose corn syrup and are lower in sugar.		I personally like Stubbs BBQ which you can get on Amazon which doesn't have high fructose corn syrup.
1,ok scent not one of my favorite Method scents
1,I didn't realize it's a Nestle product which uses GMO and resists labeling them
1,I bought these because they seemed to advertise being soft, and they ARE, and they slowly release into the ear and that's really nice, but I have rain just outside my bedroom window that causes all sorts of pitter patters and I could still hear it close to perfectly with these in :( I would definitely recommend these if you were just trying to soften noise you wanted to hear anyway, such as maybe at a concert, but it won't destroy it, which is what I wanted them for... because I wanted to sleep... because it's called dreamgirl.
1,too oily
1,Horrible.  Dry, crumbly, filling hard.  Had to throw them away.  Inedible.  Would give ZERO stars if possible.
1,Hello, The product I came was not like the photo, is very similar but not the same that I bought , just consume it, but not the same Offered in the page.
1,Yuck.
1,The liner smudges terribly. Nothing perfect about this item.	I had to return it.
1,These bars are tasty but include high maltose corn syrup - listed as their second ingredient. If I'd know that, wouldn't have eaten them. There are healthier bars out there like Kashi bars with almonds and dark chocolate and NO corn syrup. Would skip these until the company omits the corn syrup.		Ingredients	Whole Grain Oats, High Maltose Corn Syrup, Raisins, Almonds, Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Rice Flour, Chicory Root Extract, Fructose, Cranberries, Canola Oil, Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin, Soy Lecithin, Salt, Barley Malt Extract, Baking Soda, Natural Flavor, Mixed Tocopherols Added to Retain Freshness.
1,Ordered with the Prime Pantry items, and I did not like this soup..  The liquid part was OK but never did find any broccoli in it.  There was one piece of something which may have been cheese but couldn't tell for sure.		Will not purchase this item again.		Still appreciate the convenience of delivery to my door.		Not recommended.
1,Where is the pork?
1,The pasta is kind of mushy and the sauce is sweet. I am really not much of a fan. There are other brands that are better than this
1,sugar-free gatorade is not for me, I'll buy the other kind next time
1,Don't buy this right now, you'll be getting a jar with a yellow and red label saying "New Recipe" and "Our Richest Thickest Recipe Ever". It is not good compared to the original "Old World Style" flavored with Meat. It has some odd aftertaste that may be more oregano or some sort of chemical and is not as dense a consistency. I've contacted Amazon and they're going to look into why the label doesn't match the graphic here.		I hope Ragu hasn't decided to keep this "new recipe" they're selling now.
1,A gift
1,These were stale and disgusting! We were so excited to try the rainbow flavors too. I love strawberry twizzlers, but these were just gross. I tried a bite of each flavor, and all were equally disgusting. I don't know if its a flavor issue or if they were just stale, but I will never buy these again. EVER!
1,Glue stays on skin when band-aid is removed, and bandaid shreds while you're wearing it. Then when peeled off, it rips into pieces. Weird- I love all the other bandages but these are faulty.
1,It's good and all but after a few bites the darn thing has you craving sugary treats instead.	Probably due to the small amount of sugar used to try and get you addicted to it, on a small level ofc.	It's not working with nuts apparently..	Also thats a cheap shot way to get customers in my opinion.
1,Maybe I was expecting to much out of these. I am currently not drinking soda as much as I used to. I figured this would be a good alternative to soda. I just couldn't get used to them.
1,Fake cheese flavor,
1,This soup has a strange color, and lack-luster flavor. I will probably not order it again.
1,Mixed feelings. I purchased these as an option to prevent over measuring / overuse.  As Clorox liquid reformulated to a stronger concentration I was concerned because the gasket of my front loading washing machine was showing wear (gray faded).		I switched to this product and was happy that they were self contained but disappointed that:	1. I had damage to my Clorox brand dish towels; The Clorox tablets "melted" the fabric of the Clorox dish towels and they had only been washed 5-7 times. The washer was filled with 12 dishtowels and a tablecloth.  I would only use these tablets if you have a very full load; they are strong and could possibly damage fabrics		Update 12.15.17:	My fears were true - the gasket area that had worn down to a lighter color a year ago has truly cracked in the weakened area.  The new HE machines just don't use enough water to rinse out this product out of the machine after the cycle is over.		Update 3.18.18:	Indeed had to replace the inner gasket of the washer - after it was removed I found two other hairline cracks.		My end assessment remains - not enough water in the front loading washers to completely rinse this product free of your washers gasket.	Of note Amazon sells replacement gaskets and although it was an off brand it still fit the drum of our washer.
1,Not much salt/vinegar taste.  They arrived all crushed up.  Will not order their product again.
1,Terrible -- its like they don't know how to pack a tissue box.  All the tissues were coming out in pieces and chunks
1,When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!
1,I have discovered that I am not a fan of toasted chip crackers... I just don't think they are very good.
1,This is very little chicken and lots and lots of mushy "dumplings".  The "dumplings" are just globs of congealed flour.
1,Not nearly strong enough to even begin to go between teeth that are close together.  Not an alternative to floss.  Not good as a toothpick either because they bend so easily.
1,Sorry, didn't like the taste or looks. Reminded me of a chewy brownie wanna-be the color of the three I looked at a dark color. There wasn't enough fruit in them to make a difference in the flavor all that much. I threw all away.
1,Has too much sugar - over sweet. The crunch is good.
1,This is not the normal special K. It's not just made with rice that includes wheat. I just don't like the red berries. They seem fake
1,For some reason, these pasta shapes make a fantastic product taste bad.  Never again will I purchase these; I'll stick to the elbow original.
1,Didn't help hubbies dry scalp. But every one is different and it might work for others.
1,Remarkably low on flavor. Very small portions for such a high price. Very high in calories for the tiny portions received.
1,dont like cubes
1,Nasty
1,Love pringles .BUT most every can was busted up in little pieces. Roughly handled in shipping i guess
1,This is poor quality tea, but if you are looking for that fast food restaurant quality tea, this is what you are looking for.
1,That said, these were a disappointment.
1,I've bought this Organic Apple Cider Vinegar before, and I've also seen it in stores.  Never have I seen it (or any other organic ACV) priced anywhere near what it costs here.  The fault is my own for not paying closer attention to the size of the bottles, but I do think there is a bit of deception--or at the very least, price gouging--in this being sold for the same price that two 32 oz. bottles (twice as much!) would normally sell for.  The vinegar itself is very good, and I don't mean for my review to reflect otherwise; however, most people buying this product already know how great it is.  Those who already use the product might easily assume (as I did) that the bottles are the 32 oz., because the price is in line with that, and those who have not bought this product before should be warned that this product can be gotten for half the price.  Two 16 oz. bottles for $16.49 is the same price as I'd normally pay for two 32 oz. bottles!  Please take note of this if you are considering purchasing this item.
1,Dreadful taste.  not sure it tastes anything like it's supposed to.
1,I ordered this to try it - I usually order Zevia, and this was much cheaper.  As they say - you get what you pay for.  They taste like a metal can with a weird aftertaste that I can't describe - period.  The 6 pack plastic does not work, cans are loose.  Two were pierced and made a mess.  I could have worked with that if the soda was any good, but don't waste your money here.  I am back to Zevia and natural sweeteners.
1,We used this religiously until realizing the Methylisothiazolinone in the soap was causing skin problems for everyone in my household. It may be free and clear but includes this horrible chemical.
1,Update: In The middle of July I noticed a difference in the feel and smell of this conditioner. It felt really greasy and had a off putting odor that I find hard to describe. I didn't like the way my hair began to look either. It was becoming straight and limp and light brown. I shopped around for a replacement before deciding that TRESemme was right for my hair. I am sorry that they changed this product. I no longer use this product so I can't recommend it now.		[Original 5 Star Review]	I purchase both Hello hydration shampoo and conditioner. After trying all kinds of products over the years for my waist length red dry hair. Both store  brands and salon brands too. I didn't expect Hello Hydration to do much for my hair. I however was stunned to find that my hair is now at the best it has ever been, having been using both the shampoo and conditioner. If I must use a detangler I use suave when I blow dry my hair. The best part is the rinsing out takes no time at all. I am very please with this product & would highly recommend it.
1,Because of the way my new work schedule is, I typically eat lunch at my desk... however, if I get super busy I sometimes am so distracted that I don't realize I'm hungry.  Or by the time I do, it is almost time to go home.  So about a 1/3 of my packed lunches were going to waste.		I ordered all of the offered Dr. McDougalls soup/noodle cups.  I rated most of the 4 stars, but really didn't like this one.  The couscous has a strange texture and the flavor just is off.  I know it is low sodium, so my expectations weren't sky high, but I typically end up eating about half and then tossing it because I'm just not fond of the flavor or texture.		I like the other Asian flavored ones and the Pilafs much better.		I won't reorder these
1,Kids hated it. It smelled ok but tasted very bland.
1,The orange smell is really quite pungent and artificial. I really do not like this version of the shampoo at all. It also leaves my hair feeling less than clean...like it has a film on it.
1,Every cookie was broken.
1,My Son loves these so I'm giving 5 stars in spite of the fact that the cans were dented. I get these for him as a treat once in a while. I should feed him food from a dented can? What a WASTE.
1,The claim was no sticky after feel. It certainly did not work that way for me, my skin felt tacky. I returned it.
1,Great cookies, but mine arrived saturated with cleaning product and I had to throw them away.  Prime Pantry doesn't always do a good job segregating cleaning items from food items.  My box arrived with a  broken bottle of spray bathroom cleaner with bleach which made a huge mess and ruined the cookies, paper napkins and other food.  It was a terrible mess to clean up the other non-food items. I'd give 5 stars for the product, but one star for Prime Pantry's packaging.
1,The taste of coffee made from particular cups is weak and acidic, just awful.
1,Horrible. I could find no one who would drink it.
1,Tired 2 and didn't like either of them. To me they taste oily and I don't like the flavor. I'll stick with my old standby, Betty Crocker.
1,I don't taste any flavor just carbonation. I was expecting a hint of flavor.
1,Bag was crushed by a case of V8 energy drinks packaged with it.
1,Does not lather unless you use a lot, which equates to simply pouring money down the drain.  And does an astonishingly poor job or removing residue.
1,thin, not absorbant
1,I like the idea of organic soup, but this tasted a bit weird - I'm thinking it's possibly due to using an aseptic container.
1,FYI these are not flushable and will clog your toilet, septic system, or can cause sewer issues. Either don't get them or throw away instead of flushing
1,Its is all sugar
1,Didn't like the taste or texture. I used it for cheesecake. Big mistake (you may feel differently).
1,I didn't like the very chewy ginger pieces. If you like chewy ginger pieces in a crunchy ginger cookie then these are for you.
1,Leaked in the shipping box.  Big mess.  It does smell good.
1,I did not like the taste of this bread. Tastes dry unless toasted and unless cream cheese or butter put on. I will never order this bread again. Tastes a little sour to me.
1,Too expensive
1,Great taste, but just so darn dry! Will not buy again. Very disappointed.
1,poor taste
1,Henceforth I will pay a bit more for Ortega brand as these turned to mush. Nasty!
1,It's great texture, but the rest sort of falls flat.
1,This rice may be quick but it has an awful chemical smell from what ever they use to preserve it. I rinsed it well with water before microwaving it and still yuck. The Minute rice boxed brand is much better and just as quick without the funky preservative smell.
1,not a fan of these at all, the blandest flavored poptart on the market. my mouth should be EXPLODING with watermelon flavor but its barely even sweet. a complete waste of poptart, AVOID COMPLETELY.
1,Items received crushed, crushed into many small bits and pieces.
1,My daughter didn't like the taste of these.  Never tried this brand...she said the cheese tasted funny.  We ended up throwing them out.  I'm sure they're fine, just individual taste when used to different brand.
1,My 2.5 year old was not at all interested in this snack. He wouldn't eat them. I ended up eating them. lol. Maybe good for a much younger child.
1,I have bought these cookies numerous times but will never buy another Kashi product again. Those ..... downsized the cookies significantly but left the box the same size! When I opened the box there was 3 inches of empty space. That is correct the cookies tray was now 3 inches shorter than the previous version and the cookies were a lot smaller. This is really unscrupulous to me, they are trying to make you think you are buying the same product but then when you get home and open the box, you get about 2/3 or less of what you used to get.		I am now wondering what else Kashi is lying about, probably about everything. To me Kashi is a very disreputable company for doing this and I will never buy another Kashi product.		I contacted Kashi about this issue more than once and their attitude said a lot about this company. They expressed No remorse, No regrets, No apologies and No consideration. They acted surprised by my concerns. It was obvious they care nothing about their customers, their reputation or losing customers.
1,ok
1,All of the cans were so bent and broken I threw them all out. A waste of time and money!
1,I love the concept of these chips, but they go a little nuts with the pepper. I like pepper, but not when there's so much on something that I choke!
1,I really don't like the taste of the sauce.  The noodles aren't great either, but it's mainly the sauce that's so off-putting for me.  After eating one portion, the others sit unused in my pantry.  And I'm not the type of person to waste food.
1,These weren't as good as I thought they would be.
1,the dough came out kind of tough to eat....
1,These tasted so bad like the flavor of plastic I threw them out. I would not even give them to the squirrels!  Nothing like the taste from years ago.
1,It had green moss and inedible.  Packaged was not torn/ripped/ or cracked.  Bad quality.
1,These cups cannot be opened without the juice squirting out on your clothes or table. So what I do is poke a small hole in the top, suck some of the juice out with a straw and the pull off the lid.	The contents are  great, but getting to it is a drag.
1,Awful, like earing sawdust. Yuck.
1,Okay favor...mix it with lemon raspberry favor to cut the taste.
1,They came smashed, and don't like the taste
1,Very bland, no depth at all.
1,I liked the product's claim to be healthy and the baby ate it, but it just looks and feels like play dough.
1,Very artificial almond flavor. Very cheap. Get what you pay for.
1,My personal taste...yuck
1,The lollipop is very good but the pepperoni is covered in this weird juice and the cheese really smells bad.
1,didnt like it
1,Not very good, they're soft alright but no enjoyable mouthfeel....... its all kinda one texture without any good flavors.	For the amount of calories in one of these things there oughta be a lot more enjoyment. Bland and gummy, with little to recommend them.	Matt's and even Aldi's make a far superior oatmeal raisin cookie.	don't bother.
1,Didn't like this but that is just me
1,Just too dang dry for me.
1,great deal
1,Love this product, but I mistakenly thought I was getting a much larger container for the price. Lesson -- read all the fine print!
1,No body liked them.
1,I like what's inside. Yet EVERY AVEENO pump product I've bought the pumps don't work. Aveeno won't give me credit or coupons. & it's expensive. The pump sticks each time you use it.
1,like these very much stay together very well
1,I will not buy these again. They are like eating thin rock. So hard you can actually cut your gums on the edges. Do not try to bite off a piece you will be in danger of snapping a tooth off. I so wanted to like these, but the flavor is bland and the hardness of this cracker makes it a poor purchase for me. We threw the box away after a few tries.
1,Beware, the chemical poison BHT included in small dosages as a way of preserving this item.		enough bht buildup can damage your body and or worse.  Most countries make it illegal for companies to sell foods containing bht.  the USA is one of the few that put the businesses before it's citizens and allow for such misconduct.		hopefully you will read this and think seriously about yours families health and start paying attention to what is foods
1,ok
1,The cans were banged up, and as you may know... It is therefore, unsafe to consume it.
1,Maybe my expectations were wrong because I thought this coconut was awful.  I love Bob's product and thought I would try this coconut, since it had great reviews.  I thought it was dry and lacked flavor so I sent it back.
1,These were really bad... and this is coming from someone who likes pretty much everything Kashi. They were super chalky and dry they came in a box that once you opened the inside packaging you could not reseal it at all which made this even worse .. tried putting them in an air tight rubber seal cookie jar ... this did not help. Also the chocolate flavor is not a deep flavor in this cookie it almost comes off as mild which is even more disappointing for a chocolate cookie
1,I haven't found any bagged, boxed or bowled noodle dish that I like. It all tastes so artificial.
1,not worth the price ,over size bag with no nuts lol
1,Came damaged. Boxes ripped somehow
1,Doesn't do much for me. Reall sticky.
1,DID NOT LIKE
1,Don't particularly like the taste.
1,Nasty do not recommend
1,This stuff tastes horrible and it does not make my mouth feel clean either.  The cheap stuff works better.
1,Not what I wanted thought it was already use?  I have to wet then carefully rinse it will burn your eyes.  Going back to my AVEENO facial wipes very nice.
1,not enough chips in each container
1,I was drawn to the product because of less sugar, but he taste is not good.  It's like using sweet n low instead of sugar- yuck.  Thumbs down from me and the 3 year old.
1,Maybelline clearly slapped there name on this eyeshadow set, as I've seen the identical one sold with a cheaper brand name on it. The applicator is a joke, so you'll have to buy some brushes if you don't have any.
1,Love Perrier but this lime flavor reminds me of lemon furniture polish.
1,YUCK!! Way too sweet. I could not choke it down:(
1,Flimsy and cheap. Would make a good travel toothbrush because you would not mind loosing it.
1,We really had a lot of fun trying these out. First of all, not sure if it is the cute catchy names or the cute catchy tops but either way the taste of all of them were all good at first.  So, I ordered the large box of Fuhgedaboudit (spelled diff on the box and in the descript in the selection amd then in the two diff areas in the body of the descript, hee hee) amd I was surprised how weak it tasted ad sort of flowery!!!!! ewww!!!	I like mine really really strong, my husband likes them medium so we aren't digging this batch and won't be ordering again..so bummed! . If it is a medium blend, I just make it on a smaller setting but then it still doesn't tasted full bodied!  Boardwalk Blend is better but I have to drink it on the setting above the espresso. If you want a full bodies yummy bold cup of joe like you would get for $4.50 a cup at a popular coffee shop get Tully's French Roast....so delicious!
1,once again a knorr pasta that is DISGUSTING. i have tried like 10 different flavors and they consistently nasty and all have the wrong cooking times. it is always hard. my kids hate this and let me tell you red beans is their FAVORITE food.
1,don't like how small the toothbrush head is. won't be buying again. you definitely get what you pay for
1,This was the wrong one
1,melted squished
1,these are just not good.  they are grainy and have an odd flavour.  my husband, whom i bought them for, hates them.  i can choke them down, but it's nothing i'll purchase again.  maybe i'll pass them out at halloween lol.
1,I didn't like the taste of this. Just my opinion.
1,Box bought through Prime had mold growing from the bottom. Barilla did not respond to email inquiry. Could be Prime storage problem or manufacturer. FYI
1,I have a little boy and ordered this because it seemed to be a unisex product. However, the bag that I received has purple and pink butterflies on it and is very feminine. It's not a big deal. But I am a little disappointed because it's not what I expected/thought I was ordering.
1,the jelly is very runny and way to thin so it will come out as you squeeze the bottle. I don't like it at all.
1,This is an "okay" toothpaste, but I wouldn't consider it a whitening toothpaste. I have noticed no difference with using this for 3 months. The flavor is toothpaste-y and it isn't super gritty, so I guess those are the only good things I can say about it.
1,Each time I used these pods in my Kurig machine, it clogged it upl
1,Wish they had more stickum!. They have a tendency to fall off.
1,Ive tried three different flavors of these Pace rice meals.  TBH Im not a fan of any of them.  Theres a strange after taste to these products that don't wash away easily with water.  That being said, if I had to choose I would prefer the steak based dishes to the chicken ones.  Ill finish eating what I ordered since I don't like wasting money, but won't be re-ordering this any further.
1,Terrible product, even when prepared carefully and according to instruction. Just a mess, don't know how these ever escaped the Kraft test kitchens. Don't buy this, just nuke a couple of spuds, mash them a little, and melt a couple slices of cheese on top. That'd be cheaper, less sodium, and better for you.
1,I know it's not Amazons fault but this gel skinks. Like it's odor is unbearable. It makes me sick.
1,My local grocery used to carry this brand and most of their items were worth the splurge over cheaper ramen style noodles. They're not healthy we all know that. The nutritional content is pretty standard for this type of product. Loaded with sodium and msg. Don't let that little packet of seeweed powder fool you. Some things are worth the nutritional splurge once in awhile, so you eat something bad for you just because it tastes good. This was so not worth it. The seasoning is kind of wierd, a bit to sweet on the sweet and salty variety. The noodles, while nice, firm and otherwise good were extremely oily. Oily in the same way that bad chinese take out lo mein is on the second day. The little packet of seaweed flakes is quite bright green, but it was very powdery and stuck to the roof of my mouth in a very unpleasant way. I got about three bites in and threw it out. It's not terrible, but it isn't good either. If I'm going to eat pure junk food then I at least wanted it to taste good. There are similar products in this price range that are a lot better than this.
1,them be grits
1,Tastes pretty nasty to me.
1,Ordered the wrong thing.
1,I thought these would taste kind of like goldfish. They don't. They are extremely bland with almost no flavor st all.
1,I love bacon, but these are gross!
1,Very sticky.  Wouldn't recommend shipping during summer hot months.  Not as good as same item purchased in local store.
1,too salty and too peppery. not a good combination.
1,Disappointed with these.  Between the artificial strawberry and artificial chocolate taste, they just taste - well - artificial.
1,I never imagined i would ever leave a 1 Star review ,because i only buy 4 stars up.	This showed a 5 star so I ordered 3 cans.	First,I have no idea what this is,but its not even close to CHICKEN POT PIE TASTE.	At best its a cream of potatoes and dumplings with little Chicken flavor.	My wife and I could not finish eating them.	Sorry Campbell need to work on this one.	Note:I am known in my family as Mickey the kid that can eat anything,rarely i give bad reviews specially no to Campbell Chunky soup with i buy various types on a regularly basis.
1,good pack and go
1,Vile.  Everyone who wrote how delicious this is?  You owe me a refund.		I couldn't even choke down one can, and I ordered two different flavors.  Too heavy to return, so I poured them all down the sink and recycled the cans.
1,Kind of rough will scratch your checks up....
1,OK nothing special
1,This tasted pretty fake, which was surprising for an Annie's product. I wouldn't reorder.
1,Terrible small brush, product barely comes off, don't like this at all...it's nothing like the wonderful "scandaleyes by rimmel that i normally use...will be going back to that!
1,Tried this to find out if I would enjoy it. Not at all. The flavor was totally lost. The carbonation was too intense. Was painful to drink when warm. Not painful when cold, but tasted salty and very little fruitiness.
1,not the same taste as the package that you make yourself
1,the birds like it, which means, yes, about as plastic tasting as this kind of food can get; nice and puffed up, bit of crunch, but taste buds scream the message it could be melted down to caulk windows
1,Normally I use cloth towels, not paper towels, but I tried these because they were not on a roll.  Thicker than a tissue or a common paper towel on a roll, these hand towels absorb moisture, but are not necessary unless used in a medical at-home situation because a simple linen or terry towel works better (and can be washed, and used again).
1,Very thin and tasteless. Not a good substitute for milk as real milk is thicker and sweeter.
1,The tape didn't want to go back into the dispenser. It would just come out and unravel. Unusable.
1,it's more moisturising than it is detangling. Don't like the scent
1,These ended up being kind of inconvenient, and I was using an improper technique and hurting myself.  Maybe other people will have better luck.
1,Tastes nothing like it did in the 80s. It is like eating colored kix.
1,Tacos are supposed to be spicy but this was way overdone, especially with the salt. The shells--great idea but thick and rubbery. Plus the leftover shells lasted FOREVER in my cupboard. Which is good if you want to eat a Taco boat next month but Bad if you worry about whats in your food--cuz those babies are in it for the LONG haul!
1,bad flavour and digestibility
1,need a sugar rush? way to sweet and chocolaty for my taste. and 4 boxes was way to much so i need a mom to give it to now.
1,what the heck happened I do not know. Box was sealed tight, expiration date was good...but these were horrible. Even my son did not like them. Not crisp at all, hardly any cinnamon taste..I do not understand this lack of freshness in a new box. Can anyone explain. I really would like my money back...but that's the breaks, I guess.
1,Blah blah blah, where is any flavor?  I could have just ordered packing peanuts.  They were thrown away.
1,Yuck. Taste weird. Vanilla especially.
1,So so
1,This mascara kept flaking off & getting in my eyes. Very disappointing.
1,The texture of these are different than when buying the same from the grocery store, it's more thick and pasty than I'd like.  I'm not sure why that is, but I won't be buying these from Amazon any more.
1,received dented cans had to throw away
1,My cat isn't satisfied with just three of these and, beyond that, I'd have to give her the whole bag. Go with Greenies or Temptations.
1,Once you put heat the soup, the soup becomes a thin soup; a chuncky broth.
1,didnt like the coconut. so i guess the only lindt white aare the bonbons.
1,Flavorless
1,Fairly tasty in small amounts but after eating a full serving on two separate meals I became plagued with tummy troubles. They also Have an odd plaster like aftertaste for me unfortunately as well somehow? I'm usually a big fan of Stacey's and have no issues with pita breads but this batch or seasoning isn't worth the heart burn.
