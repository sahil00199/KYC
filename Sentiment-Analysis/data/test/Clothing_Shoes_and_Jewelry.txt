0,Love this shirt it fit well and is comfortable
0,My brother loved these shoes!
0,Fit perfectly, good material quality
0,I love it. Very nice, strong and rolls well. We carry alot of materials in home health this is a tremendous help and saves my shoulders. Would definitely recommend.
0,Daughter worn it new to her high school trip to china and said it was very comfortable.
0,Big roomy backpack. But I felt the straps cut into my shoulders if I had lots of stuff in my bag. Had a strong chemical smell when I received it in the mail but I spot cleaned it with wet towels to fix it. One problem with backpack is that you are NOT supposed to wash it, so no idea about long-term feasibility. One plus is I took it to Japan on a trip to lug all my stuff around and it held up!  You can give it a try if you want, but it's not my best backpack of all time, just better than some other options I had at the time.
0,This bright yellow CZ ring with a halo of bright white CZS shimmers beautifully. It is comfortable on my hand and can be worn night or day, work or play. Highly recommended for those seeking either a CZ themselves, or simply a beautiful gift for
0,It's a little tight for 2x fit.  Great material and feel.  Since it's a gift we can try return after holidays
0,Just as described. I like these and was not able to find locally any longer. Just wish they were a little cheaper. But well made and will purchase again.
0,Best scrubs I have purchased
0,This is my second pair and they look great and wear wonderfully. My first pair still look fine but wanted a 2nd pair at the ready. Several friends have purchased these shoes after seeing mine.
0,I absolutely love this bra. I am fairly large chested. This bra is a great minimizer and is incredibly comfortable.
0,This is really cute and well made for the price! I am 5'8" 135lbs 36C waist 27 usually a size medium or 6 but I ordered the Large because of the reviews and it fits perfectly!
0,Slipping these on, at first you might think they are too small - but they overall fit nicely, just feel a little too wide/loose at the toe bed. Enough nice details that they look nice with casual and business casual outfits.	They hold up to walking on ice well! Sort of like waffle-stompers on the bottom.
0,Love them. I have used them for a few and so far so good.
0,Very good
0,Was a gift and he was very pleased with look and sizing.
0,I am 5'2'' and 100 lb. i ordered te smallest. It is very flowey. The fabric is smooth with the thickness of good quality. The cleavage in the front is just right. shows off a little skin but not the boobs. It highlights a nice waist line and hips. The pockets make it look smart but I don't plan to put anything in them because that may drag it down and feels heavy.
0,These are great  everyday kicks! Very comfortable right out of the box. I wear them to ride my bicycle, grocery shopping, sight seeing.	I am heavy and prefer a running shoe with more support, so I DO NOT recommend these for running. My current running shoes are a different style of Asics and I like them a lot.		Fit- as others have described- order one full size up for a good fit. I am a true 9 1/2, but 10 1/2 in Asics fit me well. Shoe is narrow through the body and flat, not much support. I did have a small issue with the shoe gaping on the side, but I re-laced the sneaker to tighten the ankle and now they are great.		Style- love the look of this shoe, but the orange laces were a bit much, so I replaced them with white round athletic laces that I bought at Target for $1.00. The sole is white and the body has some white accents they look as if they were manufactured that way.

0,My wife likes them. Which is high praise.
0,My niece loves these.
0,I get lots of compliments when I wear this. It's comfy and extremely warm.
0,Handy to keep in the car for unexpected downpours. It's big enough to cover just about anyone. Cheap insurance.
0,My husband loved this...It keeps it shine and luster even after shower and wearing to work that says alot considering he owns a Tire shop. Definitely worth the price. Looks expensive and its big.. More for a man.  Buy it you will not regret it.
0,I bought these for my husband to try out as we have spent more money than I would like to admit on SmartWool socks for him.  He works outdoors and is an avid snowmobiler, so keeping his feet warm is important in both work and play.	He was skeptical of my purchase, but was quick to report back that he loves these socks.	They fit great, are soft on the inside and are extremely warm.	These socks will be purchased again without a doubt - for a lower price than SmartWool for a more comfortable sock that is equally warm these are a winning find.
0,I'd owned one of these before - for several years - and am glad to have returned to carrying one again.  I use mine for carrying my IDs and credit cards, rather than business cards; I, personally, find that a traditional bi-fold or tri-fold wallet is too bulky, so for the eight cards I carry regularly, this fits more comfortably in my pocket!
0,These loves are nice and warm for these frigid mornings we have been having here in Southern California!  Who knew we would be needing gloves like these to drive to work in the morning!  They will keep your hands nice and toasty as you walk, ride or drive!
0,I live in central Florida and needed a pair of casual shoes to wear to a bar or museum or just hanging around downtown Orlando in my shorts or jeans; something other than my usual old tennis/running shoes. These fit the bill perfectly. They are very comfortable with good arch support, but run about a quarter size small. I've worn them for about two months pretty regularly and they have broken in nicely and they still look great.
0,These are so comfortable! I swear I could live in them! The best part is that they aren't see through at all. I will definitely be buying more of these for the fall/winter. They are my new go-to leggings. For size reference, I bought the one size (0-12), and I am 5'6" and 145 lbs.
0,Nice
0,My daughter dressed as Rose from the Titanic for halloween and she wanted a HUGE dress.  Well this did it.  It was a little big at the waist (she is 9) and I had to tie it up near her armpits because it was long but the dress looked awesome.  It was so full and beautiful.. everyone kept stopping her to say how nice her dress was.  I went to a lot of stores and they were all way more money than this and this worked out great and is good quality and she uses it to dress up with her friends too.
0,good
0,GREAT SHOES
0,Not see through, good material
0,They do run a bit small, but they are super cute. Perfect for a witch costume.
0,These are very good shower or pool shoes and are very comfortable. The only issue is that they are bigger than I'd like them to be and don't pack as well as I expected. I would strongly recommend them if they will be used around the house/pool and you won't take them anywhere, except maybe to throw them into a bag to go to the beach for the day. If you need something that you will pack and if space is at a premium, I'm afraid I'd have to advise you to look elsewhere. I hate to ding the product because my packing needs aren't necessarily their problem, but I want to make sure people who might want to get them for travel know their limitations.		As far as I can tell, they fit fine. I got a slightly bigger size than what I wear, shoe wise, but that was intentional. I wanted to make sure they fit loosely.		UPDATE: after wearing these in the shower several times over the last few weeks, I've decided to get another pair for that purpose. The shoes just retain a bit too much water. Yes, they work. Yes, they're pretty good while IN the shower, but if you need to spend time drying them off (they take a little time and effort to do so), then ones that drain water would be better. I still like these and would still recommend them if they will stay in a fixed place and dry themselves (like a gym locker), but tip them up so they drain fully before storing. For pool and beach wear, I suspect they're borderline perfect.
0,A very good price for a well made product. Just as it was shown and described on the Amazon site.
0,My husband recently surprised me by ordering a bunch of maternity clothes after I complained about not having but one pair of maternity pants and no shirts, and indicated that he bought size mediums for shirts. I am normally a S/M in tops, and 4-6 in pants, at 5'3" and 135lbs. This is the first item that came in the mail, and when I took it out of the package, I was immediately worried because it definitely did not look like a medium! I looked up the product info and realized it's made to stretch and sort of be "bodycon" style, and is actually quite flattering to my figure when I put it on! It's sort of long, which I really like because it means I can alternate between leggings and jeans without worry. It did have a threading issue at the seam of the arm, which I sewed myself instead of sending back, probably a fluke. I love the blue/black, and the material is more comfortable than I thought it would be.
0,Simple. Classic look.
0,Was given as a Christmas gift and he loved it.
0,My husband is in the construction industry and he loved this as a stocking stuffer for X mas
0,My husband has the Herschel back back so I knew this would be a great addition to his bag. He was very please with the gift. The bad seems to be very high quality like his backpack. Absolutely seems to be large enough to hold all of the toiletry items a guy needs. Highly recommend.
0,best bra(s) i own, will continue to buy elomi. moves with me with no wires that dig
0,Perfect fit and very comfortable!
0,I just bought this dress in the "light orange"  it's more coral or peach.  But I love the fabric, the way it fits my chest (hardest thing about buying dresses and tops), the length sits about mid calf, and it fits true to size.  I received it within two days because of my prime membership.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase!
0,Great shoe for the price. Im running again!
0,my daughter loves it
0,I ordered this dress in the wine color and it's nice. Not see through. I am 5'8" and 115 lbs, ordered a small and it fits as expected.  A little short for work wear but fine length otherwise.  I'm pleased with my purchase; this is a perfect dress to wear with boots and a scarf.  I'll probably order another color.
0,They fit the little tyke great!  Not sure anyone should charge what they do for baby socks but the tiny humans need them.
0,I received this as a gift and love the design. The material wasn't what I expected but I still like it. It's feels a little like under armour.
0,I LOVE these jeans. They have a slim cut that is flattering and comfortable. Though they have some stretch, they feel more like denim than leggings. The pockets aren't especially deep, but they are functional. They are deep enough that I can carry my phone and keys in the front pocket at the same time.		For a long time, I have tended to size up in pants, but I've recently come to the realization that this tends to look less flattering than a snugget fit in pants. Or maybe I've developed more self confidence. I like the way these jeans highlight my legs. They look good with bother dressy and casual tops.		I'm 5'4" and did find that the medium length on these jeans is very long for me. I fold the bottom a good 5-6 inches. I likeep that look, but if you are short like me and don't nt to fold, you might want to look fo a shorter length.
0,They are so cute and fit great. I'm 5'5 and 127lb
0,I ordered a size 9 and they were extremely small. Fit more like a size 8.
0,This necklace is lightweight so comfortable to wear all day. Very pretty just like the picture.
0,Love these underwear I will definitely bye them again the material is nice I just wish they came in more colors
0,New Balance shoes have always given me comfort and support over the past 10 years.  These are the only brand of walking shoes that I have ever purchased and for those reasons!
0,Love them
0,More of a grey that a blue color but the fit was great and living in s florida it is a lightweight blazer that will get a lot of wear.  well made and fits like a glove
0,Wonderful dress
0,Fit just right, as a water shoe should.
0,I love the style
0,These kicks are great. Super comfortable, well padded and well made. I am a tall skinny man at 6'0" and 155lbs with a narrow foot, they fit like a glove and my foot does not shift around in them. Even took them for a brisk run and they seemed okay, although I am not really a runner. I have been treading around NYC for two weeks and they are holding up great even on the harsh pavement.
0,I was very happy about it and no complaints
0,MarysGift Women's Casual Plus Size Print Bohemian Dress		I ordered this AMAZING dress in the blue color. This dress is wonderfully sewn and the fabric is a nice stretch fabric but has some weight to it! No need to wear a slip with is, as it is NOT see through at all! You WILL have to wear a tank or camisole or something of the sort with it, as the deep front V is in the front and back. I find that you can sort of wear this dress in two ways as well! You can wear it as shown with the waist on your waist, OR you can pull up the waist above your chest and let the sleeves fall to the side... this gives it a shorter style and still looks sexy!! Very impressed with this dress and definately will be purchasing more. It is super hard to find a plus size dress that is cute and flattering and NOT have to wear tons of layers...		I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. Thank you for the opportunity. These words are my own and I did receive and try out these items personally.
0,Soft, easy for my 4 year old to get on his foot, nice color selection.
0,When you buy you need to remember you might be [should be] wearing something underneath.  Thus you need to buy a larger size.  The folks were nice enough to allow a free return/exchange at NO cost to me.  So very cool of them!!!  Yes thumbs up for Carhartt.
0,I wear these daily while exercising and they are very kind to my feet.
0,These are so comfortable and cute! I have always liked DG slippers and these did not disappoint. Ordered my true size 10 and fit was perfect.
0,Wear these all the time.  Love the height, the color and the feel of my foot in the boot.  Its awesome when you can feel great without spending a ton on money!
0,great quality, But not so heat as I expected
0,These slip on shoes are great! No breaking in period. They run true to size. I wear an 8 1/2 and that's what I ordered and they fit great. They are good for dressy casual, as they don't look like a sneaker.
0,Love these wedge sandles, got one pair white and one pair black,comfortable too. Margie
0,She loves & wants always wear.
0,Handy - small, but fits all my cards and easy to slip into a small purse!
0,Fit was perfect! Niece loved them for her graduation! Easy to walk in!
0,These things last longer than jeans, and I find them more comfortable and professional looking. They fit better than any pair of Levi's that I ever owned.
0,Love this brand of shoe from Timberland, however very sad that they are not making them anymore. Very comfortable, very supportive, and allows you to work for hours on your feet
0,This is a great sleep-in bra. With the right size, it's supportive, comfortable, and easy to breastfeed with in the middle of the night. I'm a D/DD cup size. I wouldn't recommend it for going out daytime wear, because it doesn't provide enough shape support. But it's useful for night time feeds and holding nipple soothies in place.
0,Kids love them!
0,Amazing! Came in absolutely fine. Fresh out of the box as one would say! Deeply recommend if you are interested in them! :)
0,soft leather works great for holding c cards. Has split in bill compartment for large and  small bills thanks Alpine.
0,Love these shoes.! Best support most comfortable . Only minus is I need to get a new pair every 3- -4 months as they wear down . Otherwise a 5 star would be in order
0,I own a pair of these in walnut in size 12C. The fit is rather snug. I wanted a pair in black and ordered the 12D. These were too large. AE has so many sizes and lasts that it makes it difficult to find the "right" fit, particularly via mail order. If you know your size, shop Amazon. Otherwise you'll be better off going to an AE store where you can try the shoes on and confirm the fit.
0,this is sooooo cute.. I put my passport in this and it is so nice. the picture doesn't do this product any justice.
0,Super adorable outfit, great quality and quick shipment
0,great pair, love the color!
0,loved it
0,I brought about 3 of these T shirts and can't wait to get more. Very comfortable and the fabric is great!
0,I love the design and function. It's convenient to set two different time zones so when I travel abroad, just one step and it will automatically wind up and set the main time zone that I choose. It's kinda big, but I am not complaining. It can also be used by a male person.
0,Very pretty and sturdy. Purchased for my 10 year old daughter for her birthday to keep her jewelry in. She loves it.
0,These are the greatest undershirts in the world.
0,Great show just a bit wide but nothing worth a return
0,Excelent
0,I own this in 5 colors!  My favorite!  Love the asymmetrical hemline - it adds just enough interest to the hem and makes the dress/top feel less-baggy.  The dress drapes better, I feel, because of the unique hemline.
0,Great looking tie and very easy to tie
0,So cute for potty training. My granddaughter loves the pics!
0,These are very durable and will last longer then non organic cotton.  They are very sturdy and soft panties I love them and good to know that I'm supporting a good trade and sustainable practices.
0,amazing boot and color! such a steal on the price. love them!
0,After wearing New Balance shoes for 20 years without issues, I took a sabbatical from wearing them. I saw the deal of the day and ordered my size. Upon arrival, I tried them on. Either my foot had changed, or the shoe maker is using a different mold on these shoes. For the 1st time, these New Balance did not true to size. They were small on one foot. Perhaps I need to stay with a dedicated running shoe.
0,Nice, well made boots! The price was excellent. Service was fast. Very sexy looking.
0,Absolutely beautiful ring! The silver in thick & the pink stones sparkle. I bought 3 for my daughters for Valentine's day, ages 22,21 &16 and they all loved it! Worth the $$
0,Very cute on my daughter.  She loved them.  She wears size 7 and that is what I bought.  She said they fit fine but she probably wouldn't be able to wear thick socks with them.  I am going to buy a pair for me!
0,Really liked my old Merrells & wanted another pr but evidently Merrells may have changed manufacturer because new ones do not come close in comfort, these are more stiff & run small had to return & get size larger but width still tight hope they will eventually break in, if not will be buying another brand.
0,The shoe is great. The color...not so much. The picture shown for "quick silver/white/lightening" depicts a silver shoe with blue lining and accents. The actual shoe is a dull dark gray. if im going to pay this much for a shoe I'd at least like the color I was expecting. Other than that the shoes themselves are great.
0,Absolutely love these shoes! They're so cute and comfy! I wear an 8.5 but ordered a 9! The only issue that I had with these shoes was that the zipper on the right shoe would get stuck and it was kind of hard to zip up! Other than that I would definitely recommend these shoes!!!! You don't even have to break them in. Just put them on and go! Danced all night in them with my husband and no sore feet at the end of the night!  Not pricey, comfy, and really cute! Order them!
0,I am a sm/md and ordered an XL. Fit is perfect. I am 5'9" and length hits right below my butt.
0,received in record time very happy!
0,Love this brand so much cheaper than Dillard's!
0,Yes.  The ones I had were a half size too short (old ones).  Took a chance and ordered these half size larger not knowing if they would fit etc.  they did fit perfectly.  I really like them as they look like tennis shoes rather than bowling shoes and very comfortable.
0,I bought several pairs of scrubs. These were the most expensive but also the best pair I bought. The material is soft and SO comfortable. The price still kills me a bit but I was happy to see a good product
0,I love it
0,Perfect!
0,Clark's shoes and boots are almost always a good fit on me! These are no exception. I always order a bit smaller in Clark's shoes as I think they run big. These are a bit more dressy; so far I've only worn them with skirts or dresses but I think they will look good with boot-cut jeans also.
0,Excellent Socks....... it's a perfect to my Little Daugher
0,I have been using my bag for several months and it has help up well.  It is very versatile and can be used for work or travel. It fit an iPad and books, etc well but is a bit small for a laptop.  My only real complaint is the orange color.  It is technically brown but definitely has an orange hue to it. I would prefer more of a true brown.
0,Smells a little funny when it arrives and wrinkles easily but super soft and super cute!
0,lovely
0,Great for sizing! I was able to adjust as things adjusted from when my son was first born to 7 months later still exclusively breastfeeding. Used it daily and would have been lost without it! I developed post partum carpel tunnel in my wrists from pumping and this bra literally saved my wrists so I could still hold my son. THANK YOU!
0,My wife likes them and she is not easy to please. Nuf said?
0,My husband loves them
0,I needed wrap around sunglasses for an eye condition I have.  My prescription sunglasses do not have the protection I need as they do not wrap around.  I purchased these for added protection over those sunglasses.  Then I realized they are a bit too dark over sunglasses, but worked out real well over my regular glasses.  An added benefit is that I can go back and forth on errands, such as shopping, and pop them on when needed, then take them off easily without having to completely switch out glasses.  When these glasses are on, you can't even tell that there are glasses under them.  They are well made and the lenses are of good quality. There is added protection above the lenses, with a little bit of "overhang" to shield the eyes.  I shared photos while wearing them and got compliments.  The only drawback to these is that they get a bit heavy after a few hours.  I wore them for a 9 hour drive and felt some soreness behind the ears.  Still, they are an excellent alternative to purchasing prescription sunglasses at a hefty price.  I saw similar glasses at the optical sales department for Kaiser, but these are half the price.  Follow the guidelines for measurement and they should work out really well.
0,So Comfy!
0,I purchased this for my 46 year old husband as a gift. He really likes it. It is sturdy and masculine-looks great on his wrist. He never takes it off and has been wearing it daily for approximately one year without any signs of wear and tear. I would recommend this item.
0,Great.
0,The one I received did not look like the picture. The face isn't as cute as it is in the picture but it'll do but I do not feel like it's worth $8.99 for the one I got. It does make it easier to find my keys though when I throw them in my bag.
0,I have these in black (the double harness style) and now the olive, which is a color I wear 50% of the time. The color is perfect. Buy a half size down since they run large.  They are great quality and I find them quite comfortable.
0,great flats and very comfortable and fits very well. it is worth the price. i love them. the colour is very nice also
0,So for the price I would buy it again but the fringe did get completely tangled and started falling out while really just walking around. I was able to just cut that section right off and salvaged it.
0,Very pretty, perfect for a Kentucky Derby Party!
0,These work as advertised, and just like most of the TSA locks you see in stores. These have a better streamlined look to them, and lay flatter against the luggage.
0,Very comfy!
0,Well made belt.
0,granddaughter "lived" in these during the first week that she received these; were great for her improving her walking skill set
0,Soft nice and glexible.
0,This pair of slippers is soft and comfortable and a very nice style
0,Very nice.
0,Good as expected
0,Chug a chug a chug a CHOO CHOO! !		As soon as these hats arrived and I opened the box, my twins saw em and started screaming THOMAS! ! !		Anything train related gets labeled that way! THEY LOVE trains!		These hats are so cute! The blue and white pin stripes are just adorable! Hats are easily adjusted and are great for pretend and dress up but it's not a hat I would want my guys wearing out and about. The material itself is thin and I'd be afraid their poor ole head would get sunburned.		I got these because our guys love to wear hats all day long at home!		Promotional product provided. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions--positive or otherwise--and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own
0,Great product
0,amazing pants and super comfy
0,This was comfortable from the moment I slid my foot in the shoe.  I've worn twice to work so far and it was great all day.
0,They are a little too big at the heel but a smaller side would be too tight. But with a quick fix they are my most comfortable shoes.
0,Our daughter lived in these all summer and they survived a few trips through the washing machine.  We will continue buying Keens for as long as our daughter wants to wear them!
0,I bought this jacket for my husband in an XL which is his normal size, it ran small so I exchanged it for an XXL and it fit fine. He loves it and finds it to  be very comfortable.
0,These shoes are SO incredibly comfortable for my 10+ hour days on my feet on hard tile. Will purchase again when needed.
0,Worked very well with a vinyl iron-on letter "R" for a team rocket halloween costume.  Everything was basically as expected.
0,Great shoes, my daughter loves Pumas but the do run just a little small and narrow, I usually order 1/2-1 size up.
0,Very pretty
0,Cute
0,Quite a bit too long for a tragus, but they are beautiful:)
0,One of the most comfortable shoes I have every owned. Loved them so much I bought another pair. Highly recommend. Fit was dead perfect.
0,I ordered these in black and red and must admit they are very nice boots.  The only problem is I ordered 6.5 and they are too big.  When I walk in them my heel actually comes up and out of the shoe.  I don't think thick socks will work because the shoe is snug everywhere else.  This is the second time I have encountered 6.5 size that is too big after years of ordering shoes.  Don't tell me they are making shoes bigger too?  I will have to send them back they will be too uncomfortable.  Going down a size will not work because the shoe fits snugly everywhere else.  I am perplexed?
0,My hubby was looking for another comfortable pair of sneakers.  These fit the bill and the foot, came quickly and he is enjoying his comfortable new sneakers.
0,Good thing I bought this white clutch, because I can partner it with any style and color of my formal dresses.
0,I found that I needed higher socks once I bought new hiking boots (Keen's Targhee boots). These socks were perfect height for warm weather hiking. I am able to hike without blisters and in full comfort.
0,Very nice ties. Good quality
0,Like the material, seems very durable and doesn't wrinkle easily.
0,I adored the dress and after a few mishaps finally received it, in the right size. i want to thank their customer service rep who made sure i finally received my dress and was happy
0,We love navy blue chuck taylors! This is my daughter's second pair. She's wearing her old pair out and we've upgraded. Very sturdy, and goes with so many different styles of outfits.
0,Carhartt :) can't go wrong with carhartt.
0,These are just classics. Will buy again.
0,They fit perfectly and came when they said they would.
0,This is actually a cute swimsuit that couples the cute style of a bikini with just a bit more coverage that covers the little bit of stretch marks on my tummy that i am self conscious about so as far as looks go its a win.  However it shipped from overseas, which took a little extra time and I think the sizing is off.  I looked at the sizing chart prior to ordering and ordered my size accordingly.  The top of this suit is definitely not designed for us busty girls and the bottom barely covered.  With a larger cup size and a little more back coverage I would love this suit.  However, I would definitely recommend sizing up on this one and it will fit a smaller chested woman in my opinion.  I did receive this suit at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.  I would actually consider re-ordering at full price in a larger size because it is very cute and covers my main area of concern but I don't know that one size would do it in the cups on the top.  I would recommend this suit for someone with the body type this suit was designed for.
0,Highly recommend!  Looks like real!  I wore it in my wedding, everyone said it looks real and classy!  I am glad that I got this pair of rings.
0,Great top! A little long, but is much lighter and softer than most rash guards. Great buy.
0,Nothing like a TIMEX. I like about this is no Calendar. Just a plain, durable, nice looking all day wear WATCH! Nicely priced, Shipped and Packaged with TLC!
0,gret fit. soft material. I am a womens size 12 and it was perfect so i assume it runs small. Love this blouse.
0,A little bit tight in the crotch area but not uncomfortably so just means I can't have much in my pockets
0,This bracelet is made well.  I like it very much.
0,My second hold closed up recently and these are just what I needed to reopen it since it was just a little bit closed up.  I wore it for an entire 6 weeks after repiercing and I had no reaction, just perfect and looks like a real diamond.  Normally I'm sensitive to anything that isn't pure gold or sterling and these gave me no negative reaction.
0,Very happy with orders!
0,Very soft and comfortable. No noise or squeaks when walking. Trade-off, they wear out quickly.
0,mother wow
0,Great outfit
0,a very pretty color
0,I love these.  I got a pack of smaller ones for a prior trip and added these larger cubes to our collection for an extended trip we just completed.  They're lightweight, which is perfect if you have flights where baggage weight is an issue.  These "large" size are a good size for men's clothing.  I previously bought some medium size cubes and a couple of small, rectangular cubes that nicely fit socks, underware and/or bathing suits.  Medium cubes nicely fit women's shorts, t-shirts, long sleeve shirts, etc.  We roll all our clothes, so to give you an idea, a medium cube held 5 or 6 rolled t-shirts and then a couple of pair of shorts or light safari pants folded and laid on top.  These end the mess that a suitcase becomes after a few days on the road.
0,These are very nice and can be worn sporty or dressy. The 32 was too long and needed to be hemmed. The 30 was too short so this worked out perfect. Great pair of pants that I highly recommend.
0,Quality is good for the price and it fits perfectly. I just wish that the pants weren't flared. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers.
0,I love the fit of this top. It's like it's made for me.
0,These seem to be well made and are lasting longer than most of my son's socks....and he is HARD on socks.
0,Great costume, but I had to get zipper replaced. The fit was perfect, but zipper would not stay up.
0,Love the great quality of Tumi products. Excellent price and made very well. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a man's wallet.
0,this was a perfect color we just when will comfortable and satisfied with this item, Thank you.the taste the love it's a great great feel your skin
0,grate size but i have small ears
0,I love this necklace! I got it as a gift for Christmas and it's perfect. It is good quality and hasn't tarnished at all.
0,tnks
0,I bought these because they have butterflies all over them; and I collect loads of things with butterflies. They mean good fortune
0,Chain is crappy but the charm is nice
0,I'm 5'10" & these have plenty of length.
0,This dress is a little small in the chest but that might just be me. I have a large chest but with a good shrug or jacket it is perfect
0,Bag is well made and designed for holding everything in a purse.  Things will no longer get	 lost in a big purse. It is so light that it does not add any weight.  Very practical and good price.	Will purchase more for family and friends.
0,very nice and good quality
0,Super cute!  They are cheap,  but I'll get a few wears out of them. I would buy again. ....
0,So soft and fits perfectly!!!
0,The color is neutral, a brownish-grey. Goes with everything. Small purse, but fits essentials comfortably.
0,good
0,Great purchase! Super warm fit perfectly and super stylish!! Love them!
0,Good product
0,Great
0,Very nice quality.  Perfect for displaying my rock and gem collection.  I will likely purchase another one for my seashells.  Sturdy construction with a nice, clean, vintage look.
0,It is a "must-have" item for those days when comfort is more important than fashionable
0,These are one of my favorite pairs of shoes ever. They're super comfortable for long periods of time. I've walked miles, danced for hours, and my feet don't hurt at all when I take them off. They look great with just about anything, and I highly recommend. Good quality too.
0,These were a bit small and didn't come in any packaging but seem nice and a good color
0,Super product at a wonderful price!  I tend to be very careless with my sunglasses.
0,I bought the shoes for a utilitarian purpose of not having much padding under my feet. But, I get compliments all the time. I didn't see that one coming.
0,I love these shoes
0,lightweight and comfortable
0,The socks are thick and look very nice.  They fit well and are well constructed.
0,This bracelet is beautiful. The leather braided band is very tight so it won't fray easily. The gold, silver and black look great together. It's quality well made and durable. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for a fair and honest review.
0,Taos sandals are so comfortable. I have 13 pair & hope the styles keep getting more stylish. These party sandals are pretty as well as comfy.
0,Love the color.
0,a little heavy but very good looking purse. I wore it every day for few months.
0,Wife wanted a box for her earrings as they are always difficult to find in a regular one.  This allows her to put a pair in each compartment, so she can see them all and select the pair she wants.  She does not wear really large earrings, but you can remove some of the separators if needed.  Lid stays open, but mirror is just decorative unless you want to come down to its level to use it as the lid props at barely past 90.  This item is more substantial than I expected for the money,  Outer shell is padded and wrapped in a leather/felt like material, and the inner is all wrapped with felt.  Closer is a snap, that is well made and secure.
0,My 12 year old loved these glasses. Only problem was they broke when she was cleaning the lenses after 3 weeks. No big loss. They were cheap.
0,Very comfy without being baggy. I am 5 ft. 4 in., 115-18 lbs. Looks like they will last.
0,I ordered seven of these canvas bags to haul beading and crafts supplies from our organization's office to lesson and sale locations. The quality of these bags is excellent: Heavy-duty, well constructed, nice finishing, great size, and with added touches I hadn't noticed in the description, including a little velcro closure, an outside front pocket, and a key fob. The bottom of the bag is reinforced and lays nice and flat when the bag is opened, making them easy to pack up with supplies. The handles are long enough to go over a shoulder, and are sturdy and wide enough that they don't dig into you.		When I was first looking at these bags, I noticed that price can vary by color/fabric choice. Since color was not an issue for us, I ordered the least-expensive option available, not knowing if it would mean getting a lower-quality product. No worries there: The bags are high quality and an outstanding value--a lot of bang for the buck--and we are thrilled with this purchase. Also, the vendor processed the order very quickly, kept in touch throughout the process, and we were surprised and delighted that they upgraded us to quicker shipping at no additional cost. Good product, smooth transaction!
0,Perfect product.
0,Overall I am very happy with my purchase. The shipping was prompt and I received the boots sooner than I expected. I purchased Clarks Desert Boots in Beeswax finish. I purchased the boots a half size smaller than what I normally wear, like what was recommended from the other reviews, and they fit perfectly. To give you an idea, I normally wear a size 8 EE, but got a size 7 1/2 M. I have short, but wide feetkind of like Flintstone feet. These boots definitely fit larger than what your normal size is.		The first day of wearing them was a bit uncomfortable. The leather and soles were stiff and tight, as to be expected with new leather boots. My feet hurt and I thought I might've made a mistake. However, I hung in there and wore them again and after two days of break-in they have become the most comfortable boot I have (I have two other pairs of ClarksMedway style boots, which they don't make anymore). You need to wear them at least a couple of days consecutively in order to break them indon't give up!!! My son, has the same Desert boots and told me to keep wearing them for several days in order to break them in and he was spot on! The leather stretches to fit your feet. You can't just wear them one day a week and expect they to break in.		If I have any issues with the boots it would be thislike I said my son has them same exact boots, but his were darker than mine. The boots I got were a lot lighter, quite a bit lighter actually. I almost thought they were the wrong boots (I had purchased the Beeswax color), but realized that not all leather boots will be exactly the same. I was about to return them, but decided to keep them and am extremely happy I did!		Some reviewers have said not to put sealant on them, but that is just nonsensicalI don't have the suede version so I cannot speak for that style of leather. I put Obenauf's Heavy Duty LP on my Clark's Desert Boots and it not only made them dark, but it has protected my investmentand that is what your Clark's are an investment. Some reviewers have also said that the Crepe soles are slipperyI live in Oregon and have not found that to be true, the gripping has been great!		If you are on the fence in purchasing these boots like I was, don't keep yourself from missing out on probably the most comfortable boots you'all ever own. If you have the money get them.
0,I'm not a nurse but these are just comfy and convenient.
0,I love these!  Nice, comfy fit!  Wear them nearly every day.
0,Colors are bold and bright, even after many washings.  The shirt didn't shrink (prewashed), so I wasn't frustrated when my husband put it on after washing.		One of my husband's favorite shirts!
0,For pennies it works just fine.
0,Excelent
0,Love chucks
0,Very simple and beautiful
0,Perfect for my son who does not know how to tie his shoes!
0,Regarding all of the reviews about these. Nowhere did it say that the jeans were already prewashed and preshrunk. THEY ARE!!!  So if your looking for ready to wear Levi's 501 Original jeans. This is what you need!!!  If you want the pain of washing and drying to fit. Get the ones that say SHRINK TO FIT. The package arrived on time. Nicely packaged. I examined them with a fine tooth comb. All seams were professionally sewn. No little threads hanging out. The denim seemed like I remember my old ones. I figure I'll wear these awhile. Then was in cold water. Dry on low or permanent press setting. Of course they'll fade with time. Also be alot more comfortable. Who cares where they're made. Mine are from Mexico. But the quality control of Levi Strauss seems to be working. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend these!! Plus they were an excellent buy at $39.00!!
0,I had to return the item since it was too large for me. But that one time that I fit it I can see and feel the good quality of the item. It is not like other boots where in the leather feels like a thin piece of paper and was just supported with harder stuff inside. This one can somewhat be compared to a TImberland quality boots. I do recommend it though, if you are looking for an affordable boots and still have a high quality. Just make sure that you double-check the sizes though. All in all, nice product.
0,Bought as a gift. She loves it and it is getting regular use. Great value! Well worth the money spent! I may get more. Will take a while to ship.
0,Finally a 3XLT "big and tall" shirt. Not a shirt labeled 3xt that should be labeled for "short and fat" I'm 6'5" tall and 340pounds of pure table muscle.  :) other "tall shirts" leave me looking like gus-gus, especially after washing and drying them. This shirt keeps my "plumber side" covered at all times. The collar also fits my 19" neck nicely without looking like one of Saturn's rings.
0,Only worn once so far. Too early to critique!
0,Much Smaller than anticipated; about the size of a young girl's hand, but it holds a lot of rings. The fingers are skinny enough that you don't have to worry about if they will fit or not.
0,I ordered a size up after reading the reviews so I'd have room for socks if I wanted them. They are just what I wanted!
0,I purchased these a few years ago but never left a review!  They have stood the test of time, and I enjoy wearing them ( I puchased 2 )
0,The spectacular beauty of the 10.00 ct round blue and white color cubic zirconia CZ bracelet will impress even the most difficult jewelry collector. This 7 inch bracelet is flawlessly crafted for the alternating stunning blue and white CZ  to the extraordinary mirror perfect shine of the residual link and clasp. Also,the clasp is both an easy open and secure close so that your beautiful bracelet remains secure on your wrist. Finally,I must tell you that the presentation of this product is remarkable. Clearly,this high quality product looks and feels like a premium estate piece of finely crafted jewelry. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves exquisite extraordinary jewelry.i purchased this product as a lightning deal on Amazon and was in no way compensated for my review. Truly, I just love this bracelet.
0,Gives a really big push up for a strapless bra! good quality
0,I have not worn them yet, but I do like them very much.
0,These are good quality, well made flip flops.  Not at all flimsy and are super comfortable.  They do seem to run a bit on the small side so if you're between sizes I would go up a size.
0,I purchased this for a middle school age child's costume. It fit a little big for a 13 year old but worked great for Halloween. The colors were just like picture. I read other reviews that the black part of the eyes were scratched off but I did not have that issue at all. The hood was in perfect condition packaged well.
0,Excellent quality and durability
0,This is an inexpensive belt in a nice shade of brown.  If you are a young adult, or someone who works in an environment that is not obsessed with expensive clothes, then I think this will do you just fine.  I think it has good versatility, but won't last forever.
0,I sent back need another side.	Had other ones that I love the feel and keep me all in place.
0,Levi's Men's 501 Original Fit Jean, Light Stonewash, 32x30	Seguridad y responsabilidad total al momento de pagar con tarjeta de crdito... Lo recomiendo para futuras compras. = )
0,Perfect for our son as ring-bearer in our sister's wedding
0,Gorgeous!
0,Excellent
0,bought them for my dad..very stylish and he loves them
0,So comfy!
0,I'm a slim female for my age and my medium size ran too small, it's way too tight on me.
0,Great Watch, perfect price for a titanium watch!
0,I was very surprised that this fit, since their other shoes ran narrow . I love it , and the colors are very cheerful and summery.
0,Cute and comfortable, looks just like picture. Wearing for my wedding and couldn't be more pleased.
0,Striped socks fit great but the other two pair are very tight around my calves
0,I have never had much to fill out the seat of a pair of jeans.  So used to get the Wrangler trim fit, but for some reason they made the pattern a little different so they were no longer comfortable to wear in hips and waist.  These are not called trim fit, but as regular size I don't have them bagging in the rear.  The material may be a little lighter weight than the same kind of jeans I used to get four or five years ago, but the material is not stiff the first time I put them on and seems to wear pretty well.  Lee is the only brand of jeans I buy now, and Amazon has a great price on them.
0,Didn't need to break them in really. felt comfortable from the start.
0,OMG, I love them, they are so comfortable and go with so many outfits. Just love them..............
0,This shirt fits perfectly in a Med-Regular. Looks great! Feels great! It has great quality and and is sewn well.
0,Beautiful watch
0,The whole transaction was easy and prompt. The size of the shoe was true to my size. I am completely satisfied.
0,Absolutely love these sandals. They are so comfortable. They go well with every outfit, from jeans to dress clothes. I bought the white ones first and then the red and then the gold !!!  May have to check out some other colors !!!
0,My daughter loves these
0,Tried 7 different styles and 2 brands of foam shoes, kid liked these best, most minimal. For my skinny 1.75 year old Native Jeffersons were too narrow...i didn't think he had chubby feet. (Maybe we'll try natives again in a few years) Tried a pile of different croc styles, the bump-its were too stiff/ flat on the bottom and run narrower, the sandals too narrow and rubbed too much. I wasn't keen on the clogs styles at first, was concerned they would be too sloppy for toddlers, but the kid choose these. The strap was the most minimal I saw for Crocs. And the bottom is curved so they walk less like frankenstien.
0,I rated the gloves high because they are very good quality for the price.  The delivery time was excellent.  The gloves are very good when driving when its cold; they are more comfortable and do not interfere with driving as do heavier gloves.  I would recommend to anyone that drives in cold weather.
0,These slippers are warm and comfortable.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to purchase them one size larger than I usually wear. I'm glad I did because they fit perfectly.
0,Easily my favorite workout shirt
0,This is the first high cut pair of panties I have purchased and really do like them.  The material is very smooth and sheer in the back.  As a man, these provide full coverage and look very sexy.  I would recommend them for a man.
0,Came across this at AAA and bought it in time for Disney trip with 4 yr old.  It worked very well and stayed on the whole time.  The kid liked the idea of getting a special tattoo and we liked the fact that he was "branded" with our phone numbers should we be separated.  Only dislike was the fact that it's hard to write on a wiggly kid with the marker and have the entire 10 digit # fit in allotted space.  Perhaps it's because I'm an amateur at it, but the first one was kinda wonky-looking, and the second # was marginally better.  Great idea, as it proved to be a durable and fun way to ensure peace of mind.
0,Great novelty sweater.
0,Nice shoes
0,These shoes are beautiful with a vintage appeal. The comfort and support is first rate, and they are easy on and off with a zipper in the back.  The only drawback that might matter to some people, is that the shoes squeak a little. I think it's because of the padding under the leather lining. You can only hear it if your walking on carpet. I spend the vast majority of my time on tile or hardwood floors, so the sound of my footsteps drowns it out.  Many of my co-worker wear impractical heels. By midday they are hobbling in pain. Not me! In these shoes, I can walk all day in comfort.
0,I've had my eye on this beauty for 3 year until I saw the price hit rock bottom here on Amazon. It is mostly pure eye candy. If you want accurate time I recommend using something like your phone. That being said I have noticed that my watch remands accurate if the coil is kept wound enough. It's not like it's feature rich anyway, so don't expect perfection.		It is very pretty, the hands are not easy to distinguish at a glance, and the instructions leave more to be desired/ they are very generic/including describing watches that are nothing like this one. (like how ON THE BOX it says that the watch contains a battery when it's really 100% mechanic)		SURPRISE! ring with the engraved numbers ("0" - 55) can be rotated. Kind of like "I'll met you in 15min", then twist the ring so that the arrow meets the minute hand. so when the minute hand hits '15' you know it's time to meet up.
0,What a sweet little wallet! I love the accordian style and that I can keep a couple of my most used cards on the outside. The size is the same width as my iPhone 6 and about 3/4 the length so it easily fits in the front pocket of my jeans.		The leather is soft and the color is nice and bright. It feels well made and although only time will tell, I expect it to hold up well under regular use.		*I received this item at a discount in return for my honest opinion.
0,Wonderful bra. It's so comfortable you can wear it all day without any discomfort.  It fits perfectly. The best bra I've ever worn. Great support without a wire digging in causing pain and discomfort. Definitely will buy more of this style.	.
0,I switched over from normal boxers to knit boxers and I'm very happy with the increased comfort I have. The material is soft and doesn't restrict my movements as much as the standard boxers used to. I will be buying more of these boxers soon. I recommend them to others.
0,Love these shoes.  But the color is more mint than light blue.  Still, they are very comfortable
0,I'm a short asian man at 5'3" so slimfit is hard to come by without walking into the "boys" section, love you for giving me an affordable alternative Doublju
0,These were perfect for a quick vacation to Colorado (we live in Hawaii and have no need for these things). They fit as expected and were true to size. They did get a coat of waterproofing to help protect them from getting wet. Well constructed with good quality materials. I'd recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of boots like this.
0,I feel good wearing the product, as I like things that fit snugly.  Lol, maybe it will inspire me to work out to lose weight.
0,Orderred these boots with little apprehension since already had purchased another riding boot that fit pretty snug around the calve area.  But this boot has plenty of room to wear with a thicker pants.  They don't look cheap for price I would recommend this boot and maybe even buying a second pair
0,So comfortable.  They fit perfectly and are not too long even when barefoot.  They are extremely soft and haven't lost their shape.  They definitely flatter my figure (which is saying a lot for sweat pants)		I am 5'6" 157lb (29.5 in waist, 36 hips widest, 33.5 on hip bones) I wear a size 6 sometimes an 8 (although they tend to run a little big).  They have a nice amount of room in the leg (19.5 in thigh at midpoint and 20.5 inch at top) and do not pull or bunch.  I don't have a problem with the waistband flipping over.  They are great for lounging around the house or running a quick errand to the grocery store.  We are getting ready to have a cold snap, so I'll see how they do against the wind and cold, but as long as I'm not outside too long I should be fine (if I have to shovel the driveway, I'm putting on thermal underwear) :D
0,Purchased as a gift just as I described the Sprit Dragonfly earrings, and these also may not be given away as they were much better in person than in the picture.
0,I bought this set to match another bracelet I already have.  I wear the jewelry with a turquoise open cardigan and the match is great.  The price was wonderful for three pieces.
0,This scarf is super soft on your neck and has a thickness that is just right.  My only complaint is that the color is off.  The red is orangy instead of deep red and the black only comprises 1/3 of the scar instead of a full half.
0,The pants are nice. I really like them,  but they're too long for me.
0,Beautiful bootie and really nice burgundy leather. Good heel height for comfort. Looks really great with jeans, slacks, skirts, dresses, etc. Fits well and comfortable.
0,Not bad, very light, feels cheap, but looks pretty nice
0,Excellent shorts.
0,I'm not saying this works miracles or anything but it is totally legit, used on suede, leather and canvas and it didn't destroy any of the fabrics... One of these was a vans shoe with a million different colors(Disney princesses) that I was worried would bleed but didn't. Totally satisfied with this product
0,My soon has been wearing this style of boots since he was old enough to climb into his abuelo's work boots and pretend they were his own.  His grandparents bought him a pair, and we've been replacing them in bigger sizes ever since.  They're very durable, even when scuffed (as little boy shoes tend to get), a polish will bring them around.  We've saved all our pairs for his younger siblings to wear.		This style is very dignified, my son wears them as his church shoes and is very pleased to be able to wear boots to Mass like his daddy.		Also, in my opinion, this style is appropriate for girls as well as boys.  I would wear them, if they made them big enough.
0,Nice boots! Tried them on went for a long hike in the woods, boots were very stiff so I thought I would have sore feet when I got home, but to my surprise and  delight I had no sore spots at all. Still need to be broke in but these are going to be a great pare and long lasting just like my last Rocky boots that I owned!
0,My sone perposed to his now bride to be I bought a beautiful white box to put her engagment ring in so of course I had to buy him one too loved this case so elegant sophisticated love the sleekness shape black leather looks wavy opening and the lil bright light inside too
0,Good
0,Great backpack for my son!
0,This was a gift for my son in law and he loved it. The shirt is quality and the print is silk screen. Good shirt
0,I ordered one sometime ago and these are the replacements.  Stylish and good for casual wear.  Fit just like any chuck taylors.
0,Good
0,Very good quality
0,Awesome, best color combo.
0,I just love this style of top!!!!!  It fits nicely and its very comfy!!!
0,Excellent
0,love it
0,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. According to him: They're comfortable and durable, and he wants me to buy more." What else is there to say?		***Update: About 1 1/2 years later and they're still in great condition and my husband still likes them so I suppose they're worth every cent.
0,Love these. They are so adorable. Color is bright and beautiful. My baby girl is in love with minions and she won't take them off.
0,LOVE it.  Was hoping to find something I didn't like because I'm always looking for a bargain and thought I'd be able to find it at T.J. Maxx or Marshall's for less,  Well, it doesn't matter now because I love this jacket and there's no way I'm parting with it!	I'm 5'5", full 36D, will usually wear a large for any top with buttons.  Buttons aren't usually my friend.  I bought the sz. 12 in Navy and it fits perfectly.
0,Perfect Fit. The waist band blends much more than it looks in the picture. They don't roll or bunch. Super cozy and soft. LOVE THEM :)
0,Anything by HUE and I'm with it. Just order a size up
0,Love Clark shoes!  I'm ashamed to say how many Clark sandals I've bought this summer from Amazon.  All of them fit just great and are so comfortable.
0,This bra makes it so much easier to pump. The bra is made of excellent quality and feels very secure.
0,We originally bought our son a size 14, and it was way too small.  He typically wears a size 12 pants with a cinch waist, because he's tall and thin.  The pants barely fit him in the waist, and the length was a bit short.  So we exchanged it for a size 16, which are just long enough but large in the waist.  So he needs to wear a belt with it.  The size 16 shirt fits him pretty well, but the clip-on tie is a bit short.
0,Love these. Not painful to wear. The interior gap is rather small and would not be good for those with larger nipples. Over all this product is great!
0,classic reeboks used for working. they are a great fit with great support. I highly recommend.
0,Somewhat small in the waist. I think I need to lose weight.
0,Great support and no underwire.  Fits well.
0,Wore all day and walked 5 miles the first day wearing..was suprised at how comfortable they actually were.
0,Simple and great shoes for spring/summer. For a good cause too. What's not to like? I'm gonna get more for sure.
0,My Boyfriend loved it!
0,In Love!
0,Bought this for my 5 1/2 year girl.  She's tall and slim.  Size XS fit her perfectly but won't last for the next season son I'd say it runs just a tad small.  Very warm and nice fit.  Recommended!
0,I'm outside quite often on weekends and try to keep the sun off my face. I use these No Headache Visors all the time. I probably have five of them around and use them all the time. And as advertised - no headaches!
0,I am a proud owner of at least 25 pairs of Crocs... Loved the yellow for my fun days... and they can be accesesorized for office also.
0,Very nice looking boot. Love that	they are not bulky. Haven't got to use them hard yet. Next week we are going hunting so I will have a better idea. I run between a 6 to 7. I got 6 1/2  they fit snug and I like that.
0,I was really happily surprised when I tried the Hanes Assorted Fashion Briefs...I wanted comfort and a good look as well....something more than just the basics and I wasn't disapointed.  They are very soft and comfortable with a great fit and the colors were a good mix.  Very happy with buying on line...they were as Advertised and a good price to boot.
0,It's compact while being able to hold WAY more than you think it can. The anti-theft is effective. It's water resistant. It's comfortable.		It's such a relief to have a purse that is cross-body. When you wear purses that hang on one shoulder, they impede your ability to move. Cross-body gives me freedom to move my arms or run or whatever I need to do without worrying my purse will fall.		I bought this for a trip to Europe, but I loved it so much that I use it every day now. It looks sleek enough to wear to the office, but it's practical enough to wear to outdoor events. I do switch to other purses for fancy events.
0,My second pair of these.  I really like them.  They are cotton and very soft.  Thick enough to hold their shape better than other leggings that are cotton.  I'm a little over 5'3" and they could be a bit shorter in the length for me, but I understand that I'm probably under the average height so I just kind of bunch them up a little bit.  Wish they came in white!!
0,For a no underwire bra support is better than expected! would like it better if the center had a strap going to the shoulder to provide a little more. Does NOT create the "uni-boob" as much as others I have tried, thank goodness!
0,very comfortable
0,I'm a 14/16. I bought the 1x and it fits comfortable.
0,The dress is elegant and beautiful but a bit small since I've gained some weight
0,These are comfy and lightweight - just what I wanted.  They wash well, aren't staticky like some other fabrics, and look cute... perfect for lazy days around the house.
0,This is the greatest sun hat ever for the Texas sun.  Your shadow makes you look like a cowboy.  Haven't got it wet yet tho'.  Fit my 3XL head perfectly.
0,As a nurse I'm on my feet ALOT! These shoes are so comfortable. Easy on and off, which is important to me as I have to go from nurse to mom in .5 seconds. My feet actually stay nice and cool somehow in these shoes. I love them. I can't wait to order a few more!
0,ok
0,They are exactly what I was looking for and look great too.
0,Fits well, doesn't ride up, and doesn't become loose. The only down side is the craftsmanship. I've bought two packs and about 4 of the underwear have already started to split at the stitching. If these lasted longer they would be fantastic.
0,I really like this wallet.  I have another one just like it that finally bit the dust.  The bright color makes it easy to spot in my purse.  It has oodles of space in it.  If you like big wallets, you'll love this one.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I don't like a zippered compartment for change, I like a snap closure.
0,TRUMPETTE ARE THE ONLY SOCKS THAT STAY ON HIS FEET! THEY LOOK LIKE SHOES WITHOUT THE HASSLE AND COME IN GREAT COLORS!
0,One thing about changing brands online is that you don't know if the item will fit.  The IZOD slim fit large is consistent in size and shape with other slim fit shirts.  It fits me well, looks good, and is made of a great material.  Nothing more to ask for.
0,Cute cut, soft material. I wear a L in most workout tops, or XL in fitted things (so I have room). The L fit me just right. Seems like it will work well for its purpose--working out. Moderately modest coverage of the cleavage, which I appreciate, but not so much so that I feel like a granny. The fabric seems durable enough.		I actually wore it to work with a cardigan and jeans, before wearing to the gym that evening. I anticipate ordering a couple other colors and taking them on vacation, where I can wear them under cardigans for indoor activities but also be able to use them for hiking/working out.
0,Excellente
0,Birthday present for my mother in law. Be aware the brand runs big. I always suggest to try the shoes at the store if you have to, I mean if it's the first pair you are about to purchase. But great shoes.
0,This made nursing easier. They're comfortable too.
0,Comfortable, sole is bit slippery
0,Very comfortable.  Not extremely big.  Seems warm for wyoming winters.
0,Super comfy
0,I love this tank dress! This will look good worn as  a swimsuit coverup, night gown, a tank dress worn alone or with leggings, or yoga pants...I have ordered a lot of these because I love this company's designs so much. This makes number 6. This is super comfortable just like everything else I have gotten from this company. It is made from 95% rayon and 5% spandex. I ordered the Charcoal in an XL. I probably should have ordered a L. This is just slightly too big, but I put a tank underneath and it looks fine. Too big only makes this too low cut. My measurements are as follows: 43" bust (fullest)/ 35" waist (natural)/ 45" hips (fullest). I'm 5'7" and a pear shape...sometimes an hourglass shape, just depends on what I wear. I could comfortably wear a M, L, as well as the XL. I think anyone could. They have quite a lot of stretch. It is more about how long you want it to be than the fit I believe. It is thin material but not see through. It feels so soft on your skin. I wore it to sleep in last night. I will be ordering every color soon. I can all ready tell this will be my summer staple. Fantastic pieces of clothing!	I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  I hope my review has been helpful to you.  Thank you!
0,Love the vest.
0,fit great and were relatively easy to get on. Almost every day, we got comments about them
0,Though these are a bit on the large size, they are fun socks and I will wear them often.
0,Great price, love the color. This is a great garment bag.
0,Perfect
0,love the coverage but am I the only one that thinks they give your boobs a little bit of a strange pointy shape?
0,I love this dress. Maybe it would've looked much better if I was a little bit taller. However I am 5,4 130lb and i bought a small it fit perfectly.
0,Omg! if u live for retro 80's this is the shoe for u...super comfortable so this is a shopping girls shoe...super sexy, classy dress up or down! be prepared to get overwhelming attention! fyi my bf loves em! Nuff said!
0,Okay fit no complaint at all this order is what I expected and would recommend this item to other customers
0,For the price it serves its purpose.  I wear a size 12 and it fits over a light jacket.  It would probably not take rough wear and tear, but for just walking it the rain, it is perfect.
0,Love my Yellow Box flip flop Sandals very pretty and comfy true to size
0,I bought these in the same size I've bought plenty of different brands of pants in and these run by far the smallest for that measurement I've ever worn. Also, (though I suspect a few washings and breaking them in would solve this) the front of the pants seem very stiff and would most likely not be very comfortable for sitting for long periods of time. The fabric quality seemed to be top notch though, so there's that.
0,okay
0,These look and feel great. As a guy with big feet, buying shoes online can be scary. However, definitely get these. U will not regret it.
0,I purchased an adult size 6 for my daughter and a big kid's 4. They fit just about the same and purchasing the kid's saved a whopping $40+. They are well made, very eye-catching and she gets a lot of compliments. She said they feel great and she loves them. I am very please with Amazon.com's 2 day Prime shipping service.
0,very satisfied
0,I really like this shirt. I paired it with a pair of knee high brown boots and jeans.
0,very warm used both sub zero weather and shovling
0,These are great shoes. My daughter is very picky about shoes and she loves them.
0,Nice fit, soft material.
0,Although they run a bit large, the XL/Tall fits like many 2XL's, it doesn't shrink up, and is as 'tall' as it should be!	One of the best 'pocket' T-shirt values out there!
0,My girl love's it. Fits great. Fast shipping.
0,comfy
0,Only four stars because the fabric is a little thinner than the last time I purchased these briefs.  Nice colors. Wash and dry without shrinking.  Upside is 12 pairs for a great price.
0,my girlfriend loved these jeans!  She is a tall (5'11") curvy girl and the size 17 fit awesome for her.
0,i love this dress but it keeps pulling up each time i walk
0,I love it even if it too big
0,The extra pockets are great
0,A podiatrist recommended this to me as the best athletic shoe for foot support. He was right.
0,BEAUTIFUL.  Perfect for graduation or for anyone starting a journey.  A substantial charm.  Done well.
0,Absolutely Beautiful...more beautiful and richer than the picture shows. The stones are raised and very sparkly. I wear a 10M in most round toe shoes and ordered a 10...perfect fit!
0,Perfect size and can't beat the price.
0,These feel great on my feet. Specially since its hard to find comfortable shoes for my flat feet. Love them! They might feel a little tight but its because you have to break them in. in a couple of days they should fit perfectly.
0,Exactly right.
0,Have bought these Dearfoams for years.  Wear well,and wash and air dry easily.  Good buy.
0,Excellent :) Good quality
0,Soft. Very comfortable. Love the fact that a portion of the price goes to help out kids somewhere in need.
0,I like the pants, and will order more.
0,Very soft with lots of cushion on the bottom with but a tad small.  I wear a 10 and they feel more like a size 9.5.  I'll keep them but have to wear them without socks, and even then a little too short.  Hoping they will stretch out before they make my toes fall asleep.
0,Most comfortable bra I ever bought and reasonable price
0,I love these little rain boots. Comfy and true to size.
0,Kinda rubbery but I wear it.
0,I use these as uniform shirts and they are washed almost daily and have held color and form for nearly 8 months.
0,I wanted something to store business receipts other than the expanding plastic organizers you see at Office Depot.  Allows me to organize fuel, food and travel receipts.  Most receipts require folding in half to fit in the organizer.  Fits neatly in the arm rest compartment of my truck.  Not a fan of the colorful pattern on the inside of the organizer.
0,Very nice
0,Love the stone and love the ring,thank you for having this product, unfortunately it was lost fortune turned to blind Zoray	This and many other a day!
0,Good product
0,Great looking shoe.  Got tons of compliments on them.  They were purchased for a wedding, and my feet did hurt after about 5 hours in these things.  Would not recommend for regular use, but they are really stylish looking and best used for special occasions.
0,The item arrived on time and was packaged well. The quality of the product was very good. Fits very well and I am very happy about it. Will buy it again.
0,If you are tall, wear short under it.	But it's pretty good.
0,I specifically love the shoulder/sleeve of this style. Comfort and style is all it is.
0,These are wonderful for traveling. They keep everything neat and your clothes come out much less wrinkled than if they were packed the conventional way. You can use them like drawers while you are traveling so your clothes will stay very organized.  Great when traveling from place to place.
0,Cool shirt
0,Fits like my own skin . Love it !
0,love it
0,The outfit fitted well, looked just as I saw it
0,This was a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law.  She is into essential oils and was the perfect gift for her.  She loved it.
0,a real good shirt for the money it holds up to any thing the only down side is you need to get one	size biger then you normaly wear
0,My first pair of toms. Shoes were a little tight when I first got them, until I broke them in. They are flat on the bottom so very little arch support, but they are great loafers. I was wearing them to work even as a dressier shoe.
0,We purchased these to abide by the bag policy at our local arena. Having kids it's just not possible to go completely bagless. Mamas out there know you have to have an arsenal on hand 24/7. These were perfect. Easy to use and good quality. They are a great size and we have used them for the pool as well. Inexpensive and will be used a lot.
0,Not a very snug fit if you have thin feet while wearing them without socks.
0,nice
0,My son loves his new watch. Cool and modern
0,These leggings actually turned out better than I expected.  I bought a hoodie with a similar pattern & these leggings were perfect to compliment my look.
0,dank boots
0,its a special ring for my husband and just loves it. its always will be a special ring to him. thanks for the fast service also.
0,Love had for 5 years now and still look great
0,This is a beautiful pendant! Great gift at minimal cost!
0,Very comfortable, good fit and nice colors.
0,These are simple, comfortable, fit perfectly, and go with everything.  Great for the price!
0,Fits gust right.
0,This is one of my favorite Patty Boutik shirts. It's very flattering and is made well. I bought a medium  I'm 5'4 132lbs 36D and if fits just right. It fits me form fitting but not clingy tight. It's made from a heavier material and is not really soft, but not scratchy or uncomfortable at all.
0,FITS!!
0,you can never go wrong with sperrys. i love wearing these to work.
0,Best clothing purchase ever! Seriously fits like a glove but has a stretchy feel so it's not tight. Absolutely in love with this skirt you will not regret buying this!
0,Not sure what people expected, but other than the color not being as seen on a computer (bright colors, but not neon), there is nothing to complain about.  It does run small; I wear a size 12 almost always and ordered a size large.  It is snug and I could probably wear a larger sized top as I am large busted, but the pants fit perfectly.  This type outfit was worn "snug" back in the day when I wore it as a college girl.  The sequins have not fallen off and the fabric is typical costume fabric.  It exceeds my expectations and I recommend it as a costume.  I got the YOPO 28 inch wig to go with it and it is very nice for the price/purpose (costume party!).
0,Great buy
0,Looks exactly like converse but better
0,Super cute and comfy!
0,Got this as a gift for a girl who normally takes a size 4T. I bought the 5-6 figuring it would be a little big but it fit perfectly now. Hope she gets a yer out of it because she absolutely LOVES it. She was so excited when she saw it had wings too.
0,Quality appears excellent as does value.
0,I do love these. Comfortable, seem to be made well. Hand wash item. Order size or 2 up
0,Love these stockings. Fits as expected and love the rich color and great quality. Hue is my favorite!!
0,It made a perfect gift to my son who is a paramedic student. It has all the gadgets he needs to do his job and he loves the style.
0,Free product provided for evaluation and review.	I got the 26" chain.		This is a really nice, thick, 26" chain with a nice, big lobster claw.  It lies flat if you make sure you put it on carefully so that isn't twisted.  To me it is just the right weight to be solid, but comfortable. It weighs 1.37 ounces, or 39 grams.	Being stainless steel, it won't discolor the skin, change colors itself, or rust under normal wearing conditions.  It looks really nice, and it is thick enough to be manly.  It has a nice feel.	I really like it - it goes with a lot of clothes.  My son loves it.
0,Good product, fast delivery. I am not sure if it will wash and dure as well as my cotton pairs, but this is quite comfortable (I have a bunion at the big toe, and I can wear a toe separator between my big toe and the next toe, inserting it over the sock, instead of under it.)
0,Love them...second set I have bought
0,My daughter loves these shoes.  They are super cute on. Toe is not real hard leather like converse so they are subject to creases and dings. Super cute shoe though.
0,Very nice substitute for the real thing.  The size makes it seem real.  I think it is a good idea to have a duplicate for travel and also as a test to see how happy you would be with the real thing.  I bought it for someone in a nursing home rather than putting her diamonds at risk.
0,Love them.
0,Good
0,Can't say enough about this product. They feel great and can easily be washed out when traveling. They dry in just a few hours.
0,Fits as expected, comfortable and looks really good.
0,Good quality for the price.  We got the 4t for our four and half year old and fit was pretty good.  Tie was a bit short.  Considering he will outgrow before he probably ever has a chance to wear it again, I consider this a good value.
0,i have worn these flip flops all summer/ and if i haven't my daughter has!!
0,im obsessed with wearing the appropriate shoes to the changing weather so i needed this shoes and i love how fast they came( that is if you use the prime membership) and they came in perfect condition.
0,They are Levi, they were fine
0,Good buy
0,These were comfy right out of the box  I wore them all day the first time with no problems.  I am a consistent 7.5 medium and these work for medium to slightly wider feet.  The subtle brass trim adds interest and style.  Hoping they hold up over time.  The last pair of mocs I ordered (different brand) were my go to closed toe shoes for casual wear.  I literally wore holes in them after several years of use.
0,The most comfortable fit
0,Nice, comfortable slippers
0,Love the design and stretchy spandex material. It made it through two airports and cross country travel unscathed
0,High quality and heavy printed shirt. Has not worn or rubbed off like so many do as this has sustained many wearings and washing/drying!	A definite recommendation to BUY!	(Sizes are "american" accurate and not smallish)		Is he strong? Listen bud, He's got radioactive blood. Can he swing from a thread Take a look overhead Hey, there There goes the Spiderman.
0,Comfy, soft, sensual! I would buy another. I am a 38D .
0,Really nice heavier weight material, that's not sheer. Very comfortable, waist is a little large on me. I saw these on someone 5 years ago and am thrilled my husband for them for me.
0,Very good quality fabric, I was actually surprised when opening the package.
0,Our daughter loves them.  Very unique.
0,Shirt is Good for hot weather . Very thin material.
0,You just can't beat paying $25 for a good looking classic sling back pump!	There wasn't much padding on the sole, so buy some inexpensive pads, your feet will thank you - but that's the only thing negative thing I have to say. The shoes look great, I bought the nude patent leather, and I will most likely this shoe in more colors. Go for it!
0,All I can say is Wow! This clutch is absolutely beautiful. It's not that big, yet not that small. The bad contains the right amount of bling and to say the least, I have received numerous of compliments about it. This is one purchase you will not regret!
0,So far one of my favorite socks. Not to thin, not to thick. No real arch support squeeze that I can notice. Very comfortable and so far they stay up
0,Kool
0,I got the brown bag. It is the perfect size for me with lots of compartments to easily find things. I wish it was made of better quality/looking material. It looks kinda cheap.
0,Perfect
0,I am a fan of sports bras.  Usually, I used to buy them from the Gap until I found this Seamless bra.  The ones from the Gap where digging in my shoulder and the Adidas Seamless feels great.  It works for yoga and sports that do not have high intensity.  This bra is very comfortable.  I purchased other two colors.  The material is soft and the adjustable straps are great.
0,Love it. Very sturdy. This is one of the hardest working totes that I have.
0,Not the best slide for toddlers with thick feet. Tight fit and he cannot put them on by humself.
0,my son loves these pants
0,Beautiful, very good quality
0,This little pj set met my high expectations;  it's adorable, well made and made my granddaughter very happy!   I always buy children's pajamas a size up, to allow for more comfort and shrinkage.
0,My husband loves these shoes to work in. He is a GC and is on his feet a lot as well as ladders, uneven ground, etc and this brand and style hold up the best for him in his line of work.
0,good fit
0,Buen Producto
0,The ruffles mean you don't need extra petticoats to cover the look of hoops, it was nice to get a layer out of the way. I could sit down (it looked a little funny) but I was comfortable in this all day. I am 5'4" and I wore 3" heels, it was a bit long, I wish I had shortened it a bit, but that is easy to work out. My friends got hoops that were MUCH larger, and they could barely move (and sewing their dresses took alot of extra fabric)	This one has plenty of poof to make a statement
0,They're Levi's. Enough said.
0,My favorite shoes! I was thrilled to find these black ones for a lower price than expected. They do take some time to be broken in, so they are a tad narrow at first, but I wear them so often they got broken in within a week or two. Excellent quality and trendy style!
0,Great pattern, just like the picture. I do wish i would have ordered a size smaller that what I normally order. Very comfy and I get lots of compliments on it
0,A good transaction. Item is as advertised -- good and sturdy (unlike, apparently, other similar tools). Fulfilled quickly. I would buy from this supplier again.
0,Love my bright shoes! They are vans and I own quite a few pairs so I knew they would fit.
0,perfect underwear, high quality
0,I got this cute 3-piece Floral Clothing Set by Lystaii in Size 5-6 for a 5-year old girl who is tall & thin. Im leery about buying clothing online because the sizes can vary a lot but this fits her very well & she should be able to wear it again next year.	This is a 3-piece set with floral pants, solid black sleeveless top & a floral elastic headband with a bow. The pants have side pockets, an elastic waistband & slim legs. The sleeveless top is long & quite soft. The elastic headband is really cute & the bow can be worn at the side of the head or on top. This set is made of a thin, breathable fabric so even though the top is black it is still comfortable to wear in our Texas heat. The stitching on each item is straight & strong with no loose or hanging threads.	The care instructions show that this set should be dry cleaned but I washed it in cold water on the gentle cycle & then hung to dry with no shrinkage & no fading.	As a product review blogger, I often receive products free or at a deep discount in exchange for my honest review. The opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my personal use of the product.
0,Nice socks. Holding up well for my husband!
0,I bought these for my husband, and bought his usual size, 13. He said they were a tiny bit tight, but that they would fit after a few wears perfectly. They seem like nice quality, but we have only had them for about a month and he wear them only inside
0,This is such a great ring!!!  Perfect size....I love chunky rings.  We will see how it wears for the next month, but so far no green on my finger!!!  Love it!!!!
0,excelente
0,loves these
0,A little big but that isn't a bad thing
0,It's beautiful and fits right.
0,I like these shoes a good deal. Comfortable, nice looking, good value.
0,I was pleasantly surprised to find that these tights are well made, sturdy, and feel nice.  They aren't too thick, and they aren't too thin.  Also I like the seemless look, perfectly cute pair of white tights, and it's organic :)
0,Meets &or exceeds expectations
0,Very pretty though setting is thin.
0,Very comfortable.  I wear these almost every day to work.
0,No surprises.  Could have purchased the medium sized skirt as well.
0,My grandson loves this shirt.  It is detailed and "boyish"
0,Second pair owned. Wear them almost everyday.
0,I only wore the shoes for several hours at a time but they were not uncomfortable since the heel is not really high, although I have high arches and they did not have support there.  Most of all, they are really, really cute and will go with dresses, slacks, shorts.
0,Product arrived on time and in good condition. I purchased these shorts for my 13yr old daughter. Fits great and she says the material is very comfortable.
0,Bought this for a nun costume so can't say if it will work for winter. Should!
0,Fine
0,Nice statement
0,soft footbed with good support and stable for me
0,First off, these boots are gorgeous in person! I really love them, but I will be returning them because of a few drawbacks I simply can't live with.	1) The fit is slightly small. I got my normal size, an 8.5, and they fit perfectly without socks. I'm afraid ordering a size up would be too big because these fit so well without socks.  2) They are difficult to get on. This boot really needs a side zipper! It's so tough to get my foot and heel in the boots and I'm worried that struggling with it will cause wear and tear over time. The top opening is plenty roomy, it's just a matter of getting your entire foot and heel in it. Once it's on, the boot shafts are nice and loose. 3) Because they are so difficult to get on, I can't imagine getting them on over skinny jeans as I intended to wear them. Again, a zipper would solve this problem!!! 4) The design is just a little too western for me. I know I should have been able to tell this in the pictures, but I guess seeing them in person they look more western than what I though. I was thinking they were more of a bohemian look. I so wanted these to work! I will say they have a lot of cushioning in the footbed and are quite comfortable! They are so cute, it's really tough to send them back.
0,Adorable on!
0,Nice ring good price, son likes it.
0,very good
0,Got this for 10 yr old son loves the California style. Nicer in front of you than pic. Nice size very sturdy looking. Very happy with pur base.
0,This sandal croc is the best!  So comfortable. I have Planters Fashia ( problem with pain in the heel)	This is a must! great on tile floors.
0,These are wonderful! They fit my wide foot and narrow ankle perfectly! And, the color is much brighter than the picture which I love. They could not be better for me.
0,Toe socks that fit, are reasonably prices, well made and are the right color - What more could you ask for?  They are perfect for me.  Also their customer service rocks - I had a small problem and they fixed it quickly with a smile.
0,Fast shipping Great Item
0,I got the orange/yellow sunglasses for $9.00. They came in a nice, hard shell case with a cleaning cloth and soft shell travel case, as well.		For polarized lenses, you can't do much better than this!
0,Nice design	Comfortable and light weight	Really good price
0,Most comfortable jeans I have worn.
0,Great earrings for anyone who has metal allergies.
0,loving it. feel more secure
0,These sandals are comfortable, durable, and attractive. I normally wear a size 8 in regular flip flops but based up on other's reviews i decided to go down to a 7 and they are perfect. I would definitely buy them again. They go with just about everything and are different then your regular flip flop design.
0,Wow super fast shipping, and was exactly as described. No issues with anything, smoothest experience I have had.
0,Soft
0,So cute!  And once you get the laces set just right, they are awesome.  Love the grippy soles. Used them on fresh Tahoe snow and they were warm, dry, and I felt secure walking around.
0,They fit comfortably and I loved them for casual wear, but did not work for all-day on pavement. Held up better than my Toms did.
0,Love these! very comfortable! I wish I knew they existed during my first pregnancy!
0,High quality and very warm
0,The pockets help organized pens, pencils, bandage scissors, keys, etc. Washes up well. Nice maroon color.  Dickies are always great!
0,They feel nice and comfortable. Belt loops were larger than normal so it can fit wider belts, pockets were pretty deep, pants feel very sturdy. It looks like these would last me for years. I purchased this through Amazon.
0,This is one of the few dresses I got online and really liked it. Perhaps half of the dresses I bought ended up being returned, mostly due to poor fabric or hasty workmanship.	This one is definitely not like the ones made in China, which either the stitches are coming off, or they are not straight.	The fabric is cotton without a question, and you feel how smooth it is once you wear it. It is not thin either, so it won't reveal your underwear.	I bought the quilt-looking one, which I was hesitant if it would look as nice as in the picture. It really is at least as cute. One of the few dresses that the picture looks like the one shown in the picture with no gimmicks.	Overall, this dress is really nice, and I would suggest noy hesitating in terms of quality if you liked the looks. And again, it does look exactly as in the picture.	This is not like a cheap dress you would find in cheap department stores, definitely a high quality dress, both in terms of material and workmanship.	Please note that I received this product with discount in return of my unbiased review, yet I have no obligation to give a good review.
0,Best flip flops I've ever owned, hands down! This is my second pair after wearing my first pair for four summers! They are the most comfortable flip	flops and worth the price!!
0,Very soft and comfortable
0,Great value, delivery and fit.
0,I love LeSportsac products. The Cozy Plaid Red is a fun color scheme. I originally planned to use this backpack as a carryon for a trip to Italy, but it  doesn't have a zipper closure at the top so I'm going to keep it to use as my book bag for my university classes. It makes me feel young and trendy again.
0,I have been purchasing this same shoe since the late 90's or early 2000's and I plan on always owning a pair.  I own 2 pairs at a time, one for casual bounce around wear and the other for occasional affairs. Although these were made for hiking they work great on grass or pavement. As a teen I wore 10.5 medium today I am wearing 11.0 medium.
0,Fantastic Laces. These things are thicker than a Trans-Atlantic Cable. If it's heavy duty lacing that you are looking for and I expect they should fit most if not all Work or Hunting Boots buy these.
0,Very comfortable.. Thanks
0,Great for dance and for under dresses.  They fit just right and the quality was better than we expected.  Would buy again.
0,Quality product. Keeps your ears warm in the snow and wind. Made in USA, which makes it even better. I try to buy American whenever I can, you should too.
0,These shoes are spectacular!		They are very soft and comfortable, I use them for work and I can spend all day in them without any discomfort.		The heels are perfect and the material is very soft.
0,I love pediped products because they are comfortable and safty for children to wear and even run with it.. as i expected the products is amazing. I recommended other people to buy it for their children.
0,Great panties, just what I needed for everyday use, they fit perfectly, don't slip away, do not stick in your butt, almost invisible under clothes and soft and the colors are good
0,Very comfortable!	These are a great pair of boots - I typically wear Timberland Pitbosses, Irish Setters, Danners and some others, however, I  am impressed with the fit and comfort of these Carhartts - just as good as the aforementioned boots. Nice features too - insulated, waterproof, soles have good grip and overall, they look pretty good.	As for a sizing reference, I wear 10.5D in sneakers  (Nike, UA, NB, Asics - sneakers typically run small) and a 10D when boots fit as expected. ... and these do. A perfect secure fit while still having some wiggle room thanks to a larger toe box.	All in all, a solid boot that is very comfortable. Thumbs up!
0,My grand daughter is 7 and very tall for her age, I was a bit apprehensive about  ordering this as it only came in one size.  But when it arrived I found it fit her very well and she looked lovely in it.		The dress is a blue, lavender and yellow flower print, with a high waist and a yellow flower attached, it is sleeveless and has a zippered back, underneath there is a sewn in slip or liner from the neck down. It also ties in the back.		All in all it is very nice looking and very 'girly'.		Pros:  it"s pretty, sort of a bouncy dress for summer but could wear a top underneath to extend it to all year wear, nice for dress up or a party,  and my grand daughter loves it.		Cons:  100 percent cotton, (directions say hand wash or dry clean). . if you hand wash I do not see a way to remove the pretty yellow flower, and the flower is what really sets the dress off...and it appears to have glue or something helping to hook it on to the dresss..so it surely could not go thru the dryer.... 100 percent cotton, does that mean annoying wrinkles?		I have not washed it yet, but I doubt I would dry clean it but will wash it in a garment bag for delicate's and hang to dry.		I like the dress even though it requires special washing or dry clean.		I received a sample dress for my use, evaluation and review
0,I bought this shirt for my daughter in law and she absolutely loves it.  I ordered it in purple and it looks very pretty on her.  The fit is true to size.  It is a nice weight that is good for layering now that the cool weather has started.  .  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
0,Arrived when promised, and it's the perfect bag !  Have other Kipling bags, but think this one is my favorite.
0,Such a great price for these beautiful earrings!
0,This little onesie is a great color, kind of a dusty rose pink. The cotton fabric is a good quality and very soft.
0,Very nice looking and they fit well.  The heel is the perfect height.  Very pleased with this purchase and they were exactly what I was looking for.
0,My husband loves these and they are very comfortable. I ordered myself a pair of womens. They are like walking on air!
0,NIce style and color; good price.
0,Fantastic
0,My 12 yr old loves them!  The turquoise color isn't avail. in her size in the Target stores and she was SO disappointed, love that I could find them on Amazon.  BTW, in the Target stores the sizes are S,M,L,XL and on Amazon they're by shoe size.  I would've gotten the L, here I got the 8 and it's a bit big.
0,I have owned a lot of watches in my day, but this one stands out above all others. Forget that designer crap and go for this one. It's stylish, rugged, and functional. Indiglo, date and 10yr. battery life.
0,Love the shirt, wish they had an XXL but instead they only had xl. I can't dry it in the dryer bc it'll shrink so aiair dry it is.
0,Son love these
0,DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL AND FITS PERFECTLY. LOVE THE LOOK
0,These earrings have a unique style and look amazing on, love the shine in stones, happy I bought them.
0,LOVE my bag.
0,Fantastic shoes!
0,I have plantar issues at the moment, and I am not able to wear any cleats with too much arch support without being in some severe pain the next day.  These have GREATLY reduced the pain from plantar.  This seems to be due to the more flat supports in the bottom of the shoe, as well as the shoe being large/wide enough to fit my foot comfortably.  When tightly laced these shoes are very snug, but comfortable.  They have some thick padding on the inside that allow you to lace them tightly without feeling the laces around your foot.  Sometimes when lacing shoes too tightly, the laces can actually hurt the top of my foot.  This does not seem to happen with these shoes.  I will be using these for slow pitch softball games, and practices.
0,Great.  Comfortable and cool
0,love color
0,Comfortable. Fits the same as regular bra size. Not for any vigorous exercise. Good for relaxing.
0,PRETTY
0,Although they don't look like sandals, Sanuk calls them sandals.  They are very comfortable and fit like expected. I ordered my normal size.  The is no rubbing on the feet or break in period.  This is my second pair.  If you need a lot of support for your feet, you wouldn't want to go for a long walk in them.
0,Very good length
0,product is as described, nice material and fit as expected, i normally wear a m/l so i tried the large and it gave me a very nice fit, I will by again maybe in another colour.
0,These are great pants and I like them a lot they are very comfortable even on the desert heat! So why only four stars? As much as I like them I find them not as functional or comfortable as the Tac-light pants!		I will say they don't stand out as much in the tactical aspect so if your looking for something low key these will be great! Yet don't feel that the extra money is worth it over the Tac-light pants unless your looking for a low key Tactical pants.		They have held up well in the heat have had them on in 116+ degrees weather and they where not to hot! They have held up to all the things in the desert so far thorns rocks and more.
0,They fit perfect. Love it and it feels comfortable.
0,My son had ourgrown his uniform shorts and needed a couple of pairs for the last month of school.  Did not want to spend the money on uniform shorts for just one month.	These were priced low so I took a chance.  Fit great and can't tell difference fom these and his "official" school shorts.	They appear stiff at first, but once washed (with softener) were fine.
0,Hit of the party
0,Good... Excellent... Its good.. And the box its nice too... I buy this watch again, nice gift for my dad.
0,Fit better than expected
0,Excellent!  Exceeded expectations!
0,Love my chuck nice color good price & fit fast delivery
0,I'm a little fatter than i thought. But the expandable waist has got it covered.
0,as advertised:  keeps your feet warm.  Haven't had an occasion yet to test how water resistant/proof it is.  Bought it specifically because I wanted a shoe that I could put on and take off easily.  The zipper closure works well.  I was initially concerned that the zipper might work its way down as I walked but that hasn't happened.  The sole is soft and gives you a sense of walking on padding.  The ankle padding at the top of the shoe is very soft and doesn't rub against your Achilles tendon.  Compared to other Propet shoes which I've purchased, this one is true to fit compared to my other Propet styles.  Because this shoe is a bit more rigid than the other Propet shoes I have, I did have to wear it a couple of times to "break it in".  Should be a great shoe for walking/hiking in inclement weather during the fall/winter/spring.
0,Wear it everyday, 9 hours a day (at work).
0,This cardigan can go anywhere - I love that it has pockets, also...
0,Just wear them a the gym locker room for sanitation/safety. But perfect for that application.
0,Love this shoes! I can be on my feet and run errands for days while wearing this!
0,Perfectly cute!
0,Great Value!
0,This is the third pair I have purchased, and I just love them!  They are comfortable, fashionable  and dare I say "sensible" boots that you can wear every day. I get compliments every time I wear them.
0,This is a very nicely made ring and true to the size.  I would totally recommend this as a gift or wedding band.  Comes with a nice keep sake box.  I loved it and so does the hubby.
0,Nice
0,Was a bit worried about the reviews that indicated the edges were sharp, but ordered it anyway. The edges are NOT sharp, they just aren't rounded. Certainly not rough or able to scratch skin.		I was a little disappointed that there is not a black background around the dragons, as the picture showed. But the description was very accurate. Probably difficult to get an accurate picture of the background. The dragons are shiny, and around them is like a brushed metal.		All in all, a great ring at a great price. Shipping was very quick also.
0,Husband loves em
0,Excellent
0,Just a little snug, but very comfortable otherwise.
0,Love it
0,My favorite sandals of all time!  Fit is perfect.
0,Cute socks!
0,Lovely scarf. Large enough to tie in a number of attractive ways. I often wear navy blue clothes so this will get a lot of wear to the office.
0,These are adorable!
0,Cute but I wanted the light ones and they sent me the dark ones.  Fits perfectly tho
0,like it. just not water proof.
0,The chain is just your basic silver chain, no frills variety.  My wife needed to replace a broken chain for a pendant and this chain was the right price and the right length.  The links are solid and it's functionly as well as pretty.
0,One of my favorite dresses, super comfortable!
0,This is a great price.  It's the third fedora I've ordered...and this one fits best.  I think I have a normal sized head. LOL
0,Wonderful and comfy set of pyjamas. I bought these after purchasing a cheaper set from Ekouaer but those had issues with buttons. Spend a little bit more and get these higher quality pj's that have nice, large buttons that won't come undone. Love the box they ship in. Makes me feel like Fisher's Finery truly cares about what their customers think when they use such elegant packaging. It makes it a joy to receive their product. I love the eco-friendly fabric; it's lightweight, breathable, and so comfy. I don't recommend the black color if you have white pets, as there may be a bit of cling. Overall, impressed with their quality. Good purchase. Highly recommend.
0,I think these are great quality. They didn't start scuffing off (to the white underneath per other reviewers) until after a couple months of wear. I always thought Carter's was silly and overpriced (aka not worth the money) but after these boots I think I will buy from them again!		**They do not tie, they are slip on with the velcro to cinch down**
0,I get compliments when I wear it with my red sweater. It's also great for the winter holidays.
0,To expensive
0,So happy can't even describe how elated i am. Packaging was perfect extra bubnle wrap. Fits amazing kinda hard to remove except when i itch my nose it just flys out sometimes. Love my mustache!
0,This is my favorite top. Long and flattering. Very comfortable and easy to clean. Hoping to purchase a few more. Just wish they were a tad bit cheaper!
0,Good everyday boots.
0,a little small
0,Good product
0,We bought several of these in different colors. Very popular with my family and friends. Will definitely be purchasing more.
0,loved it so much ordered another one in the red.  Feels so soft, and yes the sleeves are long, but not to the point of being annoying, plus I can sew so if it bothered me I would hem them up, but they don't.  Shirt fits across my bust but is tapered more at waist without being too tight.  looks very flattering on.  Wish it came in more colors I would order a ton of them.  Material is the perfect weight.
0,I just received the watch this evening and I must say it is truly stunning.  The watch arrived in a perfect Seiko "blue" box with all tags and documentation.  The watch itself is without flaws (with a clearly readable dial, high quality bracelet, and spectacular blue watch hands). Setting up the watch was fairly easy, and it's keeping accurate time so far.  I'm anxious to wear the watch tomorrow and see how it performs.  I will update my review in a few weeks to provide my additional comments.  So far I would have to say that this is my favorite watch.
0,Make sure and size up in the waist, so if you're a waist 36, get 38's. Length is true to size.
0,OMG, I love Nine West purses!!  Absolutely love the look and feel.  Perfect size with compartments to keep everything organized.  True to the color, size and picture!  Because Amazon has provided great prices, service, shipping and products, this is my third Nine West purse purchased...thanks Amazon!
0,Much shorter than I expected.
0,The hat fit as expected, that's because so many other reviews said it was small and one size isn't going to fit all. I have a 6 7/8 hat size. It fit's me good, The bigger you go the tighter it will be. Other than that, comfortable and I like it.
0,Cute, dainty, LOVE IT!!!
0,These pants have become my first choice in everyday clothes. They are rugged enough for yard work etc. and attractive enough for going out.
0,Beautiful drape and color. 5'3", but must wear highest heels even after dryer shrinkage.
0,a white summer dress.
0,I picked up these shoes on a whim for a GREAT price.  I have NO regrets!  I was hoping they might fit the bill as a hybrid slipper that would also allow me to run outside with the dogs and putter around the yard.  When I opened the box I quickly put them on to see how they fit - they were PERFECT and so comfortable I ended up wearing them all day!  As with all Sanita's I sized up - I wear a 39 in Dansko (or an 8 - 8.5 in "regular" shoes) so I always order a 40 in Sanita's.  To those commenting about them being narrow - I did not find this to be true at all.  I suspect they didn't size up.  I have quite wide feet and I had no problems at all.  So much more support than that "other" similar looking shoe.  SUPER cute color (I got the purple - currently coveting the lime).  If you like Dansko's you will LOVE Sanita's.  My feet are wide with a high arch, I prefer Sanita's but wear both happily.  I encourage you to give these a shot and do a little research about Sanita sizing prior to your purchase - if you've worn Croc's in the past I think you will be very pleased!
0,Always great shoes. They never fail me.
0,Love this gown.  Bought it for an upcoming black tie event.  Very pleased.  Im typically an 8 and got a 12...needs minimal tailoring.
0,Comfy, sexy and cute! Fabric is soft! Love!
0,the necklace is so beautiful and the quality is so good love i
0,Fit great, I am usuing them for catwoman cosplay.
0,Look super cute in newborn pictures! I added a name to the side with heat transfer vinyl. The mom loved it. I ended up gifting her the extra color (pink) since she loved the teal so much.
0,awesome shoes, very comfortable and very light
0,The dress fits just like the photo but the material is heavy. It's very cute on but during the summer months I will have to see how it feels.
0,Love these bikinis! I purchased black and orange and they were perfect for our tropical getaway.  I will purchase a few more colors for the next one.
0,The sandal was a great fit, not a snug tight fit yet loose enough that made if very comfortable and the straps did not bother in any way.  The gold color is a little more neutral in person which made it easier to match and wear with just about everything.  Best of all they were a great alternative shoes to dance in for when wearing my heels was out of the question or unexpected parties.  One night i got caught in some mud and they cleaned up very nicely.  Very happy with this purchase!
0,GREAT LOOKING SOCKS
0,Love the shirt.  Just realize that it is an Asian product, so it will be a tighter fit than what most expect out of he ordered size.  If  you know what you're getting, you're sure to be happy.
0,I really love this color and it matches  a top I have that really looks good together
0,Cute and fits exactly as I expected. I need wide width and arch support so it is very difficult for me to find stylish shoes that fit. This is the second pair of Vionic that I own and I love them.
0,Get a lot for the price
0,Soft fabric and a roomy pocket-- big enough for an iphone 6+, but of course, it 'shows'.  BUT, roomy enough for stuff that you want to have quick access to (credit cards, etc.)
0,When I bought the first pair of Toms shoes I was somewhat apprehensive  I have 12 pairs now and I love them all.
0,After a couple weeks of wear, this is hands down my most comfortable pair of boots. I wear a size 9.5 in regular shoes, and ordered a 9. Went a half-size down, and they fit like a glove. They seem very well crafted, and the leather is of good quality. Would recommend, and buy again.  By the way; I did notice that for the first few days they seem to rub your ankles as others have said. Keep wearing them! It goes away after a bit of wear, and they're worth it!
0,Nice product, can't go wrong w/Gerber.
0,I love this tunic....will certainly get me another one.  Great with jeans for a casual evening out.  Little or no ironing required!
0,I am a huge fan of Tom's and love the mission behind their product. These shoes are amazing, sizing is perfect, super comfortable, can wear them casual or while dressed up. Will be buying more to add to my Tom's collection!!!
0,lov it
0,This is a beautiful ring and I would definitely purchase Again! Just hope it holds up to wear I plan for this ring!
0,I am a woman but I love these T's.	They fit well and go with everything!
0,Was looking for a watch for my older son. Wanted it light weight which it is but also dressy. It is perfect, light weight, not childish with the silicone jelly band , very dressy and handsome. Very happy with the price and quality. Great size, not small and not oversize.
0,I think they are super quality shoes and fantastic all around black pumps that would look great for dress up or with jeans. I take a size 10 and I ordered these in a 10 but my heel slides out. There is a little gap of space there. Unfortunately if I went down a half size I am sure my toes would be squashed. In the 10 the toe box is already as tight as I feel comfortable with. I'm sure it's just my weird feet and I'm really disappointed because I love Clarks shoes and I have other styles in a 10 that are fine. I've had some foot problems and this was my first foray back into moderate heels for office wear. I only lasted half a day and everytime I walk I have to shuffle and take tiny steps to keep my feet from coming out of my shoes. Thank God I had some flats with me as a backup. And great quality shoes but my weird feet don't fit them.
0,Love them  the fit is goods
0,Sexy, comfortable sling backs.
0,Very cute, comfortable and supportive sandal. Would definitely buy again. Love the cushy insole with a great arch support which I require. Adjustable strap gives a custom fit.
0,Great relaxing fitted pants. I switched to ordering clothes on line and it was an awesome experience!
0,Very comfortable
0,Great pair of Chucks, fits as expected. No issues here.
0,This was a GIFT and therefore, I can not answer these questions
0,Size chart is right on point and they're so comfortable
0,There is nothing I don't love about this bag.  There are no words to describe the quality and design of this bag.  It blows	my mind.  So Many compliments too.  Thank you Amazon for promotions, etc. to help someone like me to be able to	afford this quality handbag.  Frye is absolutely the best.  You will not go wrong, just order it and enjoy!!
0,Nice high quality shirts that don't shrink at a great price.
0,Love this purse lots of room.
0,Great price and shipped quickly.
0,enjoying the shades, not sure how i can fully justify the price of them still but i really do like them.
0,very comfortable
0,Finally found a quality belt that doesn't wrinkle.
0,Fit like I expected. Well made and very warm and cozy.
0,This is a beautiful shirt! I had to change who was getting it as it didn't come in any larger size, which the recipient-to-be needed. I was quite sad about that. I kept the shirt because it's so beautiful & someone else will benefit. I was surprised both with the lack of sizes & that this only came in Bondi Blue. But whatever--great shirt! Not too splashy & yet interesting. 100% cotton is a plus, too!
0,Bought this for a Casio MDV106.  I was leery, due to the low price.  No need to worry.  The clasp is secure and the bracelet has some weight to it.  Perfect fit, though the jeweler who put it on struggled a bit.  Made an inexpensive watch look great.
0,I purchased these to replace the last identical pair that were two years old. Two years of heavy use and the soles had just about worn through. The rest of the shoe was holding up really well, other than the laces, I had to replace them after one year. They don't mark the decks on my boat so that is a plus.
0,ordered small/medium since I'm a medium.  A little tight for me.  Hoping it will give with wear, since it doesn't bother me enough to return it.  I also worry that the next size up would be a tad too big and tight is better.  Certainly has a wide brim which will protect from the Aussie sun.  Hat is large but fairly lightweight.  Comes flat and I'm storing it flat until my trip to Australia in February.  Maybe not a good idea?
0,Fits great. Lots of heads turn.
0,So far so good.  This is our outside sandal, and the rain hasn't affected it at all.
0,BOMB AZZZZZZZZZ COLORS
0,Smart looking, secures belongings, well designed and constructed, can hold my MacBook Air as well as my I Pad and the miscellaneous gizmos needed.  It's just the right size and does not draw attention to itself. And it's comfortable
0,This dress is so comfortable! I got a 2X or XX-Large and it fits great. The top is a little tight, though, and I have a small chest... for those of you who have a larger bust, make sure to check out the measurements. I weight about 210lbs and am 5'5" and the 2X worked for me. Hopefully that helps.		Oh, and the light purple does not look as pictured. It almost looks like a light blue on the website, but in reality it is a lavender or lilac kind of color.
0,attractive flip flops!
0,Product as expected.
0,It fit the bill needed for my wife's funeral.got it over nite.
0,Everything is good, just a bit snug on the sleeves.  Well worth the investment.
0,nicely made, good material, womanly
0,Comfortable and cute!!
0,Just order two sizes more than what you usually wear and it will be good.
0,I wish I would've gotten this a size smaller so that it was more like a crop top but I wasn't for sure on sizing and if it would make it over my big old boobs, but it's so so so soft and warm actually, this is by far my favorite top
0,Great walking shoe, molds to shape of your foot.  This model runs a little smaller than other TOMS, but still a whole size smaller than what I usually wear.  Closest thing to barefoot, only better with a little support.  Perfect summer shoe, highly recommend
0,The black socks in this pack were a little small around my heel. Strangely, the blue ones were just fine. Overall I am happy with this 6 pack.
0,Runs true to size, fits and feels great! highly recommend
0,I think these shoes are great for running, gym, etc. I bought them for hiking but have not gotten a chance to test them out yet. They fit great, as expected. I am generally a size 7 in all shoes, sometimes a 6.5. Although some people recommend ordering a half-size up for running shoes, I ordered a 7 and I think they fit great. Not too snug, they allow room for when my feet expand during workouts. I have used these at the gym, in place of Nike shoes that are lightweight and these provide much more support and stability which is what I was looking for. I love the colors, they match pretty much all my workout clothes. The accent color is a little more green than it appears in the pictures (think mint), but I'm okay with that. Overall great shoe and I can't wait to test these out on the trails!
0,Cute top! Got a large, I'm 5'2" 120 lbs and it's form fitting.
0,I'm a fan of lavender, and these shoes with the animal print were simply irresistible!  Along with looking so pretty, the fit was	just right---I take an 8M---and oh so comfy to walk in.  My feet will thank me every time I put them on.  I would certainly	recommend these shoes.
0,I'm surprised I like this sooooo much!  It looks great with my diamond eternity band, sparkles like crazy and I can leave my large diamond in the bank!  It's lighter weight than a real diamond but that helps it not to turn on my finger.  And no one else can feel the wright!  I'd order it again!
0,Fits perfectly and looks great and perfect for Christmas!  Even better, my 6 year old loves it! She says it's soft on the inside and is comfortable!!! Big bonus!! <3
0,I like this cardigan.  The fit is great, but it is very thin--hence 4 stars and not 5.  I suspect it won't last very long.
0,Loved the suit but the first one was too large and I had to get smaller size.  I have not been able to return original because it was a gift and I did not keep original documentation.  Suit was very nicely made attention to detail was splendid.
0,Based on reviews ordered 2 sizes up and fit perfectly. Daughter loves them!
0,My son doesn't like to wear a rain jacket but living in Seattle, I feel better knowing that he has one in his backpack. This is fairly light-weight and breathable (so he actually will wear it) and is waterproof in the rain we get here (generally not very heavy). Plus it packs down nicely.		A word about sizing. My son is a skinny 54" tall and I got a medium, expecting it to last a year or hopefully two. It won't. While it fits now, by next year it will be too small and is already a little short in the arms.
0,I bought these for my daughter, currently a college student.  The price was great, and the quality is VERY GOOD.  I bought two more pairs for her in the other color set since the first set was so terrific.  My only issue is that more and more, Amazon shipments are not including a packing slip, and I like to have the paperwork to document my transactions.  However, I would purchase this product again because of the price and quality.
0,Well made and attractive.
0,my girlfriend loves it.
0,Theyre ok but I sort of wish I just bucked up the cash and got the real deal. Once you start buying good shoes its hard to truly like the knock-offs.
0,good product and delivered timely
0,LOVE them! Super comfy and thanks for the advice to order 1/2 size larger - perfect! I ordered a second pair already!
0,Great
0,Great!
0,I just love this bra -it supports well and is really comfortable (38G), however the band does come really small (tight), but I found a solution! I purchased a bra extender which is actually made of the same material on the bra hooks - Soft Seal Bra Extender 1-1/2"- Black  http://www.amazon.com/Soft-Seal-Bra-Extender-Black/dp/B007WDSP00?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00
0,Great colors, quality, and fit.  What more do you need?  It is a great shirt.
0,Son loves this zip up, I wish they had all the characters!
0,Great buy!
0,Beautiful color, nice bold purple! Absolutely beautiful and I am definitely ordering more
0,I purchased a larger size than my child wore and it fit good. Had I stayed true to size it may have been too small.
0,I can't tell you how many pair of these shoes my daughter and myself have.  We love them!  They are stylish and very comfortable to wear!!
0,I love these shoes - they are so comfortable! I do wish they were leather; I think they would be more durable. I have had the same experience of one of the elastic pieces breaking, however, mine held up longer than did a previous reviewer's shoes. I have a lot of trouble with my feet hurting, but not when I wear these!
0,I love these shoes so much! They are flexible and made from natural materials so my toddler's feet develop in a healthy way.
0,Love it! I feel sexy yet conservative. This dress is made for cold weather. It's almost fleece lined giving it a lil more smooth look to your curves
0,Fits' my short self like a mini dress or sleep shirt.  I didn't realize it would look so long. It's not my body style. Not the manufactuerers fault. It does lauder well and did not shrink.
0,Love it
0,these worked great for my trip to florida and the carnival Caribbean cruise i went on over spring break...just wish i would have bought 2 more for the front zippers on my luggage. easy to use and very durable!
0,The color was right. The design was perfect. The material was wonderful.
0,Nice shirt, good fit, but a thin material.
0,I don't know how sexy I'd call it, but this is good as a go-to piece to throw on over a tank or whatever when it's a little too chilly for just sleeveless. I ordered an extra large due to my 36D's that always make button-down sweaters gape horribly, and this one doesn't gape, so that's nice.
0,This is a very well made boot that looks good and fits well. Now we havefigured out the correct size to order, a brown pair will be next!
0,These are a little stiff, but that's too be expected I guess. I really love these boots.
0,I was pleasantly surprised with how high quality this umbrella is. For the selling price, I wasn't expecting much, but this umbrella delivered!	For starters, the expanded size of the canopy is impressive. I've got 4 umbrellas, all of the same general, compact size for each of my family members, and this one far succeeded in the canopy size. This works great because I'm usually ushering my daughter with me.	This unit is also super easy to open. One simple press of the grey button on the handle, and the umbrella is fully expanded. Press this button again to collapse it, and then push it down to close. The hand grip is also super comfortable!	All around great product. Would definitely buy again.		Sample provided for evaluation
0,Quality material and workmanship and very comfortable as well.
0,They fit, they're comfortable and they look cute. I have a difficult time getting a comfortable fit for my wide toes but narrow foot. too many days going barefoot. Price was good too.
0,Love it
0,Just as pictured, colors and all.
0,These coveralls were used as part of a Spaceballs costume I created for Halloween. They're high quality, well-stitched, and good fit. I'm a bit overweight, but there was just enough give in the chest and gut to make it right. Height measurements were spot on.
0,Runs about 2 sizes small
0,I love the fabric of this design, but it has a few problems.		Pros:	Soft, cute fabric	great color, good length	cute design	comfortable		Cons:	Very small in the chest area. Meant for smaller women, my girls did not fit well
0,I love these and get so many compliments on them! They keep me nice in warm even when its cold and rainy outside. Will be buying more in other colors.		They will shrink a little in the dryer but will go back to original size after wearing
0,love
0,VERY COMFY!!! No complaints Here. Lots of Room and Made Pretty Sturdy. Defiantly Buying More for Sure!!!!
0,good
0,HEAVY, BUT AS INDICATED HAPPY, WITH MY PURCHASE!
0,The person I bought these for loves them. Well-made, comfortable.
0,Fit perfect. Look expensive. Very happy.
0,I love converse shoes.  They have zero support, but I place in a arch support, I can wear them all day long.
0,I ordered these blue Yucatan sandals because I enjoyed my previous pair of leather Yucatans.	The blue ones are man-made materials. The fit is slightly larger, and they just do not feel the same	as the leather ones. They are well-made, though, and they look nice. But I won't buy another pair.
0,Had to buy 0.5 larger. Out of that these shoes are awesome.
0,Had another pair like these so knew what I was getting. Very comfortable. Would prefer I'd gotten some that could be polished, though.
0,The best nursing bra for me.
0,These are probably my favorite earrings from Amazon.  They are small but very shiny and they look great on me.  I bought the first pair for my daughter, but am buying a pair for myself.  They will be a favorite of mine.
0,Carry it on or check it this luggage preforms well above my expectations and has traveled but domestically and to foreign destinations with barely a scratch or dent.  The bright color makes them easy to find on the belts/luggage courosels and has turned more than one head.  The also pack extremely well; there is a zippered side as well as a side with elastic strapping that connects to hold items in place as well.  I've had to pack bottles of wine, other liquids, and delicate items to carry on and this has dealt well even with those situations where you've got an item you have tenderly wrapped and stored and come out with nice results.		I would purchase this again, and definitely recommend to others.
0,This bag is really unique. The fabric is easy to clean and repels dirt. The fabric design is really cool!  I love The overall design of this bag too. Lots of compartments for everything. The shoulder strap is plenty long to criss cross over your shoulder and adjustable if you want to make it shorter.
0,Love them...
0,nice
0,Love them
0,Purchased as an Easter dress for my daughter  - she looked darling in this beautiful dress.  In her own words "I look like a princess!"
0,If you have foot problems these shoes are great. I have plaintair fascitis and these do the trick for me! No more pain ! These are the updated version of the 927s. I like them better they seem to have a little more padding in the soles they feel more comfortable. This is the first pair of black I have purchased. They look nice with dress pants. Ilove them and would definately recomend them.
0,I love these!  They fit great and they are perfect for Spring and Summer.  Both my kids love them and never want to take them off.
0,My daughter loves these slippers and wears them out as shoes almost every day!
0,I was not sure about these as they looked a bit "granny", but I needed a smart shoe to wear with dressy slacks. I was pleasantly surprised: while the shoes do look "granny" on their own, when they are on they look very smart and stylishly retro. I am wide across the toes but narrow in the heel and these shoes fit well without slipping, and while I can't wear high heels due to back problems these are high enough to be dressy without difficulty. The shoes also are deep enough to take my orthotic inserts.
0,Sooo cute !
0,I loved it .
0,My doctor recommended I buy shoes "with strong support" for my plantar fascitis but since I had no idea what that really meant I went online to search. Saw a youtube video that showed what to look for, and also gave a list of recommended shoes (which included the Asics 19.) I took a deep breath and ordered them online without trying them on. Halellujah! They worked! My plantar fasciitis in my right foot is greatly lessened, muscle pain in my left leg is gone and I can actually walk a mile down the road again without limping back home. I think the benefit is in the cushioning under the heel, and also because it holds my foot in place and doesn't let it roll. Highly recommended and worth the money. Am online again today searching for another pair in black to wear for church, etc. Wish the price was better but you get what you pay for.
0,Super cute and authentic. Fit my 7-yr-old beautifully
0,Sooooo comfy. Well made
0,It is a great style just a little small.
0,LOVE IT
0,Beauriful! Nice quality
0,very cute shoe for work! comfortable too
0,Seems to be decent quality.  I have purchased shirts on Amazon before and had a difficuly where the size was not accurate.  Bought an XL instead of a L to make sure I have extra room.  Looks huge, but I'm sure it will shrink.  Got a good laugh out of it :)
0,Super Bling!  These little slippers are flashy but as comfy as wearing a warm sock.  I actually got these for an elderly lady who adores anything that sparkles, and she is very happy with them.  Seeing her face light up when she opened them up was worth every penny I spent, and more.
0,This ring has tarnished over time. I do not believe that it is sterling silver. I get a lot of my jewelry in sterling silver and they look a lot better than this. However, the color is unique and I like to wear it in the fall. Also, the part around the stone is more like a pattern then "rhinestones". It's just raised silver
0,My friend and I are taking a trip.  Both of us asked the other for one of these travel purses for Christmas!  It is a great size, is RFID safe, and has a cut-through body and strap.  We both love ours.
0,Beautiful color! Fits me perfectly. I got the small. I have a 26 waist . 5'3 130 pounds. Very ladylike
0,When I ordered these sandals, I had already 2 pair of the same brand for a few years and I had no doubt that the new ones would be just as comfortable as the ones I already have. I was NOT disappointed.
0,Awesome shirts. They fit as expected and don't shrink when washed.
0,Kept me toasty when it was 15 degrees (With other layers of course).
0,I got tired of watching the price go up and up for 1/2 dozen tiny plastic earring backs at Claire's ($6.99!).  These are perfect and a great bargain.
0,Beautiful, fits great
0,This belt is casual as well as dressy!
0,My daughter cried when she got this. Such a lovely, delicate necklace that reinforces my favorite reply when she asked me how much I love her. :)
0,Best work pants
0,These are exactly what I wanted to wear under my dress shirts. I initially ordered the small, (5ft 6. 140 lbs) and even those were too tight. So I had to return them and get the medium.		A big loose on me, but still better than the alternative normal undershirts that are too baggy.		Overall I recommend the slim white cotton ts.
0,If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  The fit is great.  I normally wear a size small (4/6) and I ordered a small.  The circle skirt style is flattering to my waist and hips.  The dress is not tight like a bodycon dress, so a little potbelly isn't going to look 7 months pregnant, it just flows nicely into the dress- major plus!  The fabric is soft and a little bit shimmering. The dress hits about 2-3 inches above my knees.  It's still in one piece after two washings, so I've definitely gotten my money out of it!	The pattern is amazing.  I got so many compliments that I started to feel self conscious! I am currently obsessed with flamingos, so this was just the start of my craze.	If you have come this far and are reading reviews, just buy it.  It's so cute!
0,love this wig for the price
0,I use these for my regular running shoes.  I generally run 40-55 miles a week in the shoe, and it holds up well to the elements and the streets of a city.
0,These are nice jeans well made and fit true to size. I am 5 ft 4 in 118 lbs I wear a womens small or a 4 in US sizes and I ordered a Size 7 in these (they are juniors). They are a little loose on me but I prefer a baggy fit, I probably could have ordered a 5 for a more snug fit. There os a bit of a gap in the waist I have to wear a belt with them but I really like them. Definitely worth the price!
0,I'm wearing these boots now, have walked through a lot of  snowy slush, no leaks.  They are warm and comfortable,with a pair of wool socks they fit fine.  I probably should have ordered a size 6 instead of a size 7 but that's OK.  My dogs love them, they chase my feet trying to bite the fake fur.  I definitely recommend these boots.
0,Nice and soft shoes for worm weather. It has some smell, maybe after coloring process, or maybe a shoe rubber sole smells. Hopefully this smell will go away soon.
0,So comfortable.
0,This is a long shoe horn and I used it after back surgery in order to help put my shoes on while I was unable to bend over to do so.  It worked great and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if the need arises again.
0,SK Hat shop has the est fasinators on Amazon
0,These boots look great and fit well.  Most of the Tony Lama boots I've purchased fit well and best of all, they are made in the USA!  Amazon is excellent when it comes to purchasing boots and shoes.  Their prices are competitive and their customer service is number one!
0,Excellent boot, Not much more to say. Stay dry I like the little insulation for a typical warm winter day.
0,While I just got these, I think they are great sneakers.  Hope they hold up well.
0,Bought this as a sleep cap and eye cover to warm my head and block out light at night...... and it's awesome for that. It IS definitely oversized, definitely baggy, says the man with a head diameter that often results in "one size fits all" hats leading to headaches. I suspect I might even be able to pull off dreadlocks under this hat (if I could actually grow them, that is.....)		The double layer construction is nice-- in fact, it's what makes the hat work so well. The exterior shell is just that-- underneath is a dark, soft jersey-like material that does a great job at blocking light. It's not quite as effective as some eye masks I've tried, but having this sure beats dealing with the combination of a sleep cap AND eye mask. I can pull the hat down over my eyes and tip of my nose, allowing me to have a nice, warm "black out" but still breath easily.		Not much more to say..... it's a simple product, no matter if you use it day or night!
0,I bought this for my 6 yo daughter to go to the daddy/daughter dance. I believe I bought the 5/6. The dress fit great. And it looked even better after I took a steamer to all the wrinkles.
0,good product
0,Great pair of earrings. I have problems wearing real gold and sterling silver in my ears and since piercings became a big thing, I discovered that I can wear stainless steel with no problem. I bought the rose gold because it seemed like a perfect match for my wedding band and when they came in, they were a perfect match. The edges are a tad bluntly cut but overall  the construction, weight, and quality seem great. I am thinking about ordering a second pair for my second set of holes.
0,A good balance of compression and mobility. These running leggings keep everything in place and also provide a layer of warmth for cold day workouts.
0,Love them. I can't wait to give them to my son.
0,I'm 5"5' and they do go over the knee onto the through but they are a little bit longer than I anticipated. Otherwise, the fabric is amazing and I definitely recommend this!
0,Cute and comfortable
0,Fits my torso nicely, however slightly long.  It's brand new, so after a couple of washes it'll be perfect.  This is my 2nd set of these shirts and they work as great black undershirts for work or casually going about your day.
0,Great boots!  I love them.  Arrived in a timely manner.
0,Very Good Pair Of Boots! Arrived on time! Early via Prime! Great fit, product was as described. No issues at present. Very satisfied with my purchase. Would buy from this vendor again
0,I love these Anne Klein semi- square toed shoes. I purchased a pair last summer and they were so comfortable I have been looking for the everywhere. Only place I found them was Amazon, so I bought 2 colors. They are perfect for work because they are comfortable and very stylish.. I LOVE them because they don't squash your toes. I hope Anne Klein keeps making them.
0,I found an awesome purse, the only drawback is that has a single huge pocket...	 As an insulin-dependent diabetic I need to be able to organize the contents of my bag so I can quickly locate medical equipment, drugs, etc...	 This was the perfect solution!  Well-made, it works exactly the way I wanted it to.	I highly recommend this product to anyone with a need for better organization for their bag!
0,Regarding the fit, the length is good but they are a bit tight for me in the width. I must stick with medium width or my narrow heels cause me to walk out of the heel cup. A bit of stretching and breaking in and they will be just fine. This is a terrific deal on Dan Post western boots!
0,Good Product
0,Lovely top.  Fits well and feels great!
0,I love this! Honestly, I wasn't expecting it to be a thong, but I am absolutely overjoyed with my purchase!
0,I have six of these Bras already. They are great!	PH
0,I am using these for my 10 year old's pants.  These work great as a replacement for non-stretchy kids' pants waistband ties.  They are better than just using plain elastic because the ends are properly finished, just like a shoelace.
0,Would recommend.  Durable and good price point
0,These pajamas are extremely comfortable and very attractive and durable. Because of my short height my wife cut and hemmed the cuffs -- no big thing for her. The pattern is subtle but I don't like loud and bright. Soft, they came out of the dryer w/o shrinkage. I am more than pleased.
0,When I can get him to remember to put it on it's great! I even bought a second one for my daughter after the first one showed up.
0,The only bra you will ever need.  My sister also loves this bra.  I am a 42DD AND SHE IS A 42DDD.  LOVE
0,Hood quality.  My son like them.  A bit larger than expected but nothing major.
0,sent them back
0,Ok for the price. Blocks 405nm laser pen light.
0,Extremely impressive quality, very thick and warm. I did not expect it to be this nice. My Dr. Who fan family will truly enjoy this as a Christmas gift and I wish I had purchased one for myself.
0,Wonderful shoes.  I take all shoes off as often as possible but grasshoppers fit the bill when I can't.  They are comfortable and look great as well.
0,My boy friend loves it. Nice daily shoes. There are not for active sports like for running but very comfortable and very good looking all day wear shoes.
0,fits perfectly. super fast shipping (took 3 days instead of 2 weeks). NB: they are made small. i'm a girl and they fit well, but a guy with the same size might find them too small in width and length. take a size bigger than usual. otherwise, perfect. good quality, like on the picture. many pictures ahead with those kicks on!
0,Really cute colors and the perfect size.
0,ok this was adorable, I cant believe these don't have a perfect score.. The outfit was totally true to size but the top and shorts are long enough but the top is a tad narrow. Of course most lo are not yet chubby.  My son is 4 almost 5 yr old he weighs 45iish lbs, size 5t fit perfect and looks precious. I like the material and the long shorts and style of the outfit. great play outfiit for play in hot weather. The price cant be beat,
0,I love it! I have seen the same outfit for $15+ took a risk and am glad i did. It look exactly the same and my daughter love it. We paired it with some moccasins also from amazon and it was the cutest outfit.
0,Great boots. Looking for another pair.
0,Love the way it hangs and is flattering without being tight.
0,I am 5.10. Fits perfectly. A bit smaller that on model, but it is OK.For$ 9.99 I can say it it perfect. I wish they will have red color too.
0,good
0,Beautiful earrings. More in person than online. Extremely well packaged in gift box. Colourful, well made. Arrived early. Will purchase more from seller.
0,It's just what my husband wanted.
0,This chain is so shiny and I love the adjustable part.  Great chain!
0,I don't write many reviews these days but for this belt I had to leave one. One done gentlemen, the belt is simply perfect. What else can I say? It comes in an adjustable length. Just cut an inch or two at a time on the end opposite of the end with the holes in it, insert the end into their buckle clamp and you have a custom fit belt. Brilliant! At first I was a little apprehensive about this part of the purchase but a few cuts later and boom, I was done.		I wore the belt about a dozen times so far, I didn't cut it exactly to size, I figured the leather might stretch and don't want the belt to be too short. The belt has held up good so far, the leather is friendly. The belt looks great for a work environment, not too flashy, not too casual. Fits good, looks good.		I'm impressed by the simplicity of this belt, the buckle just pulls out and reverses, giving you two colors to choose from, it's great. All for a decent price and you're almost guaranteed the belt will fit you! I wanted an inexpensive work belt for chinos and this belt fits the bill nicely. Simple purchase, add to cart now, lol		I liked this belt so much, I'm going to look at their other products, Like that ratchet dress belt with automatic buckle, lol  Don't know what that means but hey, they got this reversible belt right, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. :)  Good belt, good price. No headache.
0,Love all Lucky Brand and these sandals look great with jeans as well as my casual maxi dresses and Lucky jewelry.  Perfect fit and very comfortable.  I live in Florida, so I can wear them year round.  Thinking about ordering at least one more pair. . .
0,Daughter loves these for their school's Holiday Crazy Sock day.
0,Works great. perfect small size
0,Gorgeous dress, amazing price. Great quality
0,I bought this for my husband and he looks great in it.  Fits more snug than most "hoodies" but shows off his shape.  He on the other hand wears it only because he knows I like it.  He doesn't mind the shirt, but thinks the color is too "feminine".  It is a bit on the wine (purple) side for color.
0,I am a beef cake!! Here are my measurements, Bust-49", waist- 39", hips- 49". With that being said...this dress does fit, but it comes up very high on my chest. I am going to need to do some cutting at the top. Other than that it fits fine.
0,outstanding in every way!
0,Pretty cute. The color is not a true black so it doesn't work when work with black leggings. Also the top is very narrow and chafed my ankles to the point where I had blisters, wear tall socks/tuck your pants into them. They're very versatile, and a good value.
0,This all Black G-shock watch is awesome.......It's sporty and Dressy......Perfect for the Holidays..........	And The seller Altivo Timepieces have great and fast service.......Will be back for more G-shocks.........	This watch also has Tough Solar which is great, the battery life will last approx 10 yrs........	And love the Analog and Digital features too.
0,LOVE IT
0,I have not worn these yet, but around the house they feel good, very comfortable.  They are not navy, more like a denim blue, but that works for me. Very pleased!
0,Buy these. Great price and quality.
0,Nice regular jeans.
0,Fast Shipping great quality!
0,The bracelet is well made and durable.  It's a beautiful piece of jewelry and I am very happy with my purchase. Would highly recommend
0,I've always wondered why no one made a knee high "Ugg" looking boot.  It seemed like the natural progression from ankel to calf to knee, right?  Well I saw these and I thought I'd give them a try.  I wasn't expecting much, because I wasn't thrilled with the big ribbon tie, nor was I in love with the big flap in front of the knee.  Well, right out of the box I realized that you can wear the flap up with ease, and the ribbon could be snipped right off if you wanted.  However, the ribbon came in handy when I decided to wrap it and tie it around the very top, to keep the boots snug up against my knee caps.  Put on a denim skirt, a pair of these, and you've got sexy snow bunny written all over you!  The chocolate brown color is awesome.  Enjoy!
0,Extremely warm and comfortable. My only complaint is that the crotch region is a little too loose, so I have to wear underwear. This is a personal problem. Otherwise, good work.
0,The shoe is cute.  I ordered in the wide width of C/D.  Unfortunately they were too small.  Pinched my little toes.  If I went with the next size up the shoe would have been too long.
0,I love the boots they were too big for my grandson but I'm going to re order them to a size 3
0,Love !
0,Fits perfect! Plus free shipping! Can't beat that! I'll definitely order more in the near future.
0,It is as described. It also fits with my 5.11 outer shell, however, it's a bit longer.
0,This is a great bag with many uses. I'm not sure if I'll actually use it for toiletries just b/c I don't usually see the need to bring full-size toiletries. (Though I could see me using it if, say, we're doing a weekend road trip with plenty of luggage space and I don't want to have to buy travel-size hairspray or mess with putting my favorite products in a small compartment.) There is ample space; I could easily fit toiletries for my husband and kids as well if I go that route.		It's a nice design though that could be used for many things. The inside is a sturdy plastic bin, basically, so you could use it as a cooler bag or to carry a wide variety of other things: kids' toys/Legos when visiting Grandma, craft or art supplies, snacks for a road trip, etc. The one thing I'd be mindful of is not packing it with super heavy stuff just b/c the handle is not very long so it would be hard to carry on your shoulder. The zipper pockets for smaller items are nice as well.		Overall it is good quality and good construction; I anticipate that it will last for years and get many uses!		I received this item as part of a special promotion for the purposes of testing and providing an honest, unbiased review
0,good buy.
0,Love the soft fabric, perfect size and color is beautiful!
0,No complaints.	Beautiful Accessory	The Sparkle of the jewelry was on point.	I recommend. For this price, you can't go wrong.
0,Wore this in Cabo for a bachelorette party and loved it! Truth be told, it didn't stay on long since we were always in the pool or ocean, but it served it's purpose. To get me too and from the water in style :)
0,I used these to decorate a tree to enjoy a festive Mardi Gras! They looked cute
0,I wanted to do a Hinata cosplay and this was perfect. Everything fit as expected and was high quality and durable. This set includes the jacket and pants. Perfect for any cosplay and doesn't look like a cheap costume.
0,This is my third iteration of these shorts.  Yes, it is possible to wear them out, but it takes a while.  Great comfort while you work on wearing them out.  The fit looks good, but alas, they are not OUTER GARMENTS.
0,These are super comfortable!
0,This is a pretty pendant.  Large stone and very sparkly.  It looks better it you put it on a nice chain -- the chain it comes with is cheap and looks cheap.
0,Just love them comfortable, warm ,and very well made.
0,These Toms are just as you'd expect they'd be. They fit as I expected and the color was the same as the picture.
0,Halloween costume!
0,I am super excited about wearing these shoes when fall rolls around.  They are very comfy, the heel is just right to give a little lift without making your feet hurt.  The gray color is almost a little brown...I think I'm going to return and order the black suede.  These will look great with skinny jeans or tights and dresses.
0,Oh my, how I love this hat(s)!  It has amazing cverage blocking sun off not only face and head, but your shoulders, neck and upper back, too!  It is so accommodating, too. If you want it to flip up n the rim, or curl under a bit...No problem!  There is a bendable wire all the way around the most outer edge of brim that you can bend and flip however you desire.  The best part is still yet to come!		This hat is made to be versitle and great looking. For those days at the beach or pool with full on sun wear this hat at its fullest, and if windy don't forget the chin strap!  What about those days where you only need a little protection for that grocery store trip or a little work in the garden?  Won't it be just way too big? NOPE! Simply unbutton the big brim from around the smaller hat, and you have a cute adorable on the go shopping sun hat.  Have lots of hair, and like it up in a ponytail?  Can't do that and get a full protection hat on the beach can you? Oh yes you can!  Instead of wearing the big brim buttoned to the hat, keep it unbuttoned and wear the big brim with ponytail popping through the top.  It's a great buy and three hats for the price of one!
0,Excellent
0,I like the skirt.
0,They are so awesome fits perfect and the zipper is made way better then my other boots!
0,I should have ordered one size down
0,this is so cute and I ordered a pair of earrings to wear together , price was very reasonable.i have small wrist so it fit well and again I love Yazilind brand
0,Love!
0,I'm on my 5th pair of Un. Seal shoes over 8 years. I used to stand/walk for 8-10 hours a day at my old job and these saved my feet.		+ Toe box is nice and wide	+ Soft leather lining makes the break-in period extremely short.	+ Great cushioning under the ball of the foot.		- The foot bed has a leather center with a rubber ridge around the edge to eliminate creases. This is great at first but over time the rubber or leather can wear down and tear causing it to form tiny irritation points. This occured to me on one pair after 4 months and another after 9 months. Did not occur on the other three.	- Do not wear in wet weather. The foot bed is designed to make air flow in through the holes in the side. If you step in a puddle it does the same thing with water... It will push the water right up through the front of the shoe soaking your feet.
0,Works for a cheaper version of the belly bandit, but tends to bunch up with a lot of movement.
0,So, just like everyone else on here saying, order a size up -  please do! They do run pretty small. I was smart to order a large although typically I am a small (2-4).. Im 54, 120 lbs.. 24-26 hips,  I wouldnt recommend these if you are larger than a small/medium at most since it will most likely not fit you. Overall, it was worth it for the price, would order again! 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish they told their costumers that the sizing runs very small just so people don't get disappointed. Overall though - good quality.
0,This scrub top runs a little small but fits well and is flattering.
0,I normally wear a small and the small does fit but think a size up would have fit better.  I do like these tights. They're warm and I expect to wear them often this winter.
0,The item pictured is an off white canvas. Although the description matches the item not the picutre. Shoes are unique and fit well, seems to be authentic converse as well. Happy with them, just not as pictured.
0,I love these shoes. I'm a woman's size 8 shoe and the boys size 6.5 fit perfectly. Super comfortable right out of the box. Look great with everything.
0,these shoes are so comfortable!. Stay on but easy to slip out of.
0,Nice, comfortable, and looks very good.
0,I love the look, wish they were also crotch-less.
0,Just a bit large but able to use
0,It's thin, but I can't complain. good price
0,My daughter absolutely loves this
0,I love this little bag! It takes the place of having a separate wallet, because it has a zip pocket on the side with all kinds of slots for cards & space for cash & bills. The middle zip pocket holds my glasses & a brush & other larger items. The flap pocket works great for extras you want to get to easily, like lipstick or a passport, & the back snap pocket was great for my iPhone (the large one). The bag is lightweight, & not too big or bulky. The color is fun, though it's looking a little less than brand new now. I threw it in the wash, & it came out just fine, though still not quite as bright as before I started using it all the time. No problem for me--this is an awesome little bag that holds a lot more than you'd expect!
0,Soooooo cute.  Loved theses.
0,I liked this product, but I wish it was just a little bit longer. It's elastic and ties behind the neck, so you can tie it tighter, but then it just hurts your neck from rubbing. Still worth it though, (looking good sometimes has to come at a minor sacrifice).
0,After reading reviews, I decided to order size 11 vs 10.5 - my feet vary in different shoes, the 11 fits perfectly.  Very comfortable, this is my first pair and I love have cool shoes for the hot summer.
0,Very nice gloves.
0,good
0,I don't have to worry about my daughter getting a sunburn.  She wasn't crazy about the style of the suit because it doesn't look like other girls suits.	She got over it. If she wears her pretty suit underneath she can remove the protective suit when she wants to.		I think since she knows she's protected she has peace of mind and will hopefully never get a sunburn again
0,Other than buying the wrong size these are great shoes. Comfortable material, well made, thicker sole for the begginer climber and has a decent curve at the toe to get you started. They make what I consider to be "more advanced climbing" shoes as well as these. We went to try on others so I can reorder the right size and even the climbing instructor wears the evovle brand. In stores like REI these are $125 so it's a great deal!
0,My daughter wore this dress for her Sweet 16 B-day party and she was so beautiful. My daughter doesn't wear dresses so well (as her body is uniquely crafted by God) so it surprised me when this fit her and she looked great. I would order her Prom dress from this seller as well as her wedding dress (when a worthy suitor is available). She was so happy with the dress. We did order a size or two bigger to make sure it fits....so make sure you measure according to the information provided by the seller and if any part of the measurements are larger than the size you want, then error on the side of caution and go up to the next level. My daughter size seemed to be a size 10 until one of her measurements fell under the size 14 dress. So we got a size 14 and the dress fit her perfectly.		5 stars all day.
0,Good shoes for long distance running. Well cushioned and comfortable. However, they are quite heavy at 12.8 ounces per shoe. If you can afford spending a bit more, I'd suggest the Trance 10's over these any day as they are both good for the slight to moderate overpronator, but the trance 10's are much lighter.		Overall though, very good running shoes for longer distances.
0,Purchased for my 14 year old son and he LOVES them. I can see  or feel why. They are like walking on cushions. Also he has wider feet than most and these fit him comfortably...perfect width.
0,Although somewhat smaller than I expected, this hat did the trick.  The brim keeps rain off your face and just as importantly keep rain from running down the back of your neck.  It is durable and packs well.
0,For the price, this is a good shirt. If you're looking for a great quality, stand alone shirt, then look elsewhere. If you're looking for a simple laying shirt, then this is a good bet. Warning - this is a one-size-fits-all spandex shirt. Surprisingly, it does not roll up (as other reviewers have mentioned) for which I am grateful.
0,a little tight but hope they get better while wearing
0,Love Birkenstocks in this style--was a replacement for a pair I've had for around 8 years.
0,Love love love this dress I got sooo many compliments!!! My only advice is A) BUY THIS Dress!! B) if you have D cup or bigger size up, my DD filled the top part of the dress, still looks super cute though
0,We bought this shirt as a gift and I can't speak about how it will be after washed, etc. The color blue is beautiful and it seems of very good quality.
0,Purchased these slippers as a gift.  Unisex sizing makes it comfortable for ladies with wide feet, bunions, etc.  Very good quality.
0,The fit is good, just as I expected it would be. I ordered based on my actual waist size, as directed by the vendor. It's the perfect length for my short torso. It does hit just about where my bra underwires sit, but it's not uncomfortable. I was very satisfied to see that underneath the large mesh on the public side, there's a sheer woven underlining on the private side (interior) that stabilizes the panels between the bones. Otherwise, the corset would stretch way too much. It's very sturdy construction. I'm wearing it under a sheath dress right now and it doesn't show through at all. I'm not planning on any tight-lacing or waist-training, just want some additional back support and belly compression occasionally, and this is far more comfortable than a squeezy girdle.
0,Great quality shoelace with various color choice,
0,Between the best vehicle made and showing the American flag. Amazing.
0,Loved it
0,my young granddaughter loves it. has a removable tray and room for some precious and special items.
0,Excellent shoe at this price.  I should buy another pair.
0,Gifted this. Been a year. Was going to repurchase figuring it was needed and loved as they are worn everyday but...after a year they are still in great shape. Maybe another color.
0,I got the zebra print.  It's super cute.  Has some padding but not too much. If you have a big booty, order a little bit bigger but otherwise it's very cute.
0,Omg , I ordered this Wednesday and I got it today Saturday that's super fast. The suite is super perfect I can't wait to see my little man on wedding day. Folks believe me when I say that it looks better than the pics it is PERFECT!!  I am happy with my other.
0,Supergirl bowl. Super comfortable and choose a fit. I bought one size larger so he could wear thick socks under them.
0,It is so beautiful and I am excited to wear it!
0,I bought this for a charity ball I went to for brain tumors. The dress was so comfortable, soft, old style look with it, and people complemented on it. Which I think with any black dress there are very few that actually make a statement on their own and this dress did.
0,Very good quality. Nice fit.
0,MY WIFE LOVED THEM
0,HIT for a murder mystery on the high seas captain I won best costume!!!!!
0,If you've never worn Rockport's before, then you've never worn comfort. "and that's all I have to say about that."
0,Very comfortable but runs a bit small.
0,No problems. Love the price.
0,Presently surprised.  I didn't give it a 5-star because it doesn't take in things like the Tardis.  Other than that it has really reduced the bulk in my wallet that was really starting to bother my hip while driving.
0,Love these boots! Have been searching for this exact style for a couple years so was very excited to find them! And they are comfortable!
0,I neded warm leggings, and that's what I got.
0,excelente tama&ntilde;o, justo lo que deseaba
0,My daughter loves it. She gets tons of compliments.
0,Ordered for my husband so he can have a pair of running shoes and a pair of tennis shoes to just wear. These are to just wear. He likes them, but the 10.5D is slightly more narrow than other New Balances we've bought. The other option was a 10.5EEEE which was way too wide. He kept the 10.5D even after I offered to send them back. These are sharp looking tennis shoes.
0,I wear an 8.5 so I got the 9 and it fits exactly.  I got these in pink to go out and look super feminine.  Love the color. To me it's like pink purple. Just right for me.
0,Satisfied customer.
0,I am 5'8" and 165 lbs. I have kind of an average/athletic build - not slender, but not heavy either. I usually buy a medium in shirts/jackets, occasionally a large. After reading reviews of this item, I went with the medium. I am happy to report that it fits just right. It didn't shrink in the wash either. I really like the color (medium blue) and the weight (not too heavy but not thin - nicely substantial). It looks like it'll hold up over time, like other Champion products I have bought. This was a good purchase and I recommend the jacket highly. Those of average build, you are safe to order in your usual size!
0,I would sat these are good dance shoes if you do not want your toes stubbed by men's shoes when dancing couple dancing or social dancing.  However, they run small but too much so.  Maybe about half a size.  My shoes run 6. if wide and foot size to 7 for street sz and medium. I bought the 7 medium as my shoe sz is 7 med for street shoes and it fits like a 6.5 pair street shoes.  I wore it at the dance. Needless to say my toe nails are hurting and since I can't return them now, I will have to stretch them.  I think if you wear a street sz 7.  Better to go half a sz up, if you have slightly broad feet. No need to go up if you have on the slightly narrower side if your street sz is 7. The shoes are plenty broad but shorter on the length. (like i said length is of 6.5 when I ordered 7).  We will see about the longevity of it. I wanted a closed toe shoes with suede bottoms for salsa for protection as I have the open toed ones.
0,Very nice bag. Plenty of room to pack lots of things, and absolutely great quality
0,Like look, hate low riding.
0,I bought these for the long inseam length. They work well and look good. Button on the waist literally broke!!! the second wearing, but was easily replaced. Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars.
0,I could never wear sandals that went between my toes,but I can with these. My daughter-in- law had a pair and I tried them on  and loved them. the fit is great. Yellow Box has a great selection!
0,Amazing
0,I tried this brand out when looking for additional scrubs.  I usually buy Grey's anatomy but don't like the price tag on them...this material is thinner, but super confortable, washes well, holds the (beautiful) dark navy without fading after LOTS of washing, and fits awesome.  I buy the same size as my Grey's scrubs.  The talls fit exceptionally well (5'9" and wearing dansko shoes- the hem is ALMOST to the floor...which is exactly where I like it!).  Draw string and elastic waist is comfortable and stays in place (no crack shows for me!) even while bending and squatting on the ground).
0,I got one of these shirts in white and another in teal. I ordered "large" but I fit a size 8 (at the time of this review). So, they are roomy on me. These shirts are comfortable but not the least bit "fitted." On the plus side, they will help hide a "muffin top." Ha! But, they're not long. So, I think they wouldn't fit tall women as well. I am 5'5" or so and I have a shortish torso and the length hits me right below the waist (just as seen on the model in the picture). I think it would be even shorter on a taller woman and may end up fitting awkwardly. In the end, I probably should have ordered a "medium" to fit me in a more flattering way. But, they're inexpensive and are holding up well in the wash, so I'm happy with them.
0,These shoes are very pretty. They do run small, so I had to buy a 9.5 though my shoe sizes are 8.5 and 9. The reason they fit "as expected" is that I had ordered a size 9 from another retailer, but had to return them because they were a bit too small, so I really did expect the size 9.5 to fit well, and they did. I haven't worn them for more than a few hours, so I don't know if they would be comfortable all day long, but they were fine for the 3 hours I wore them.
0,Very comfortable fits well looks great
0,I love the color
0,love it
0,These boots are awesome and just what I expected. This boots are not to narrow and tight. They are just the right height. I would recommend these boots to anyone. They are also comfortable to those whose feet can't handle heels.
0,Love them. Bought them for mission trip in Aruba! They were perfect. I walked all over in them.
0,Love this.
0,Excellent product and very well built. Have been using them for last 4 years.
0,perfect coverup
0,Love, love, love these shoes! I have several, they fit as expected and I love the colors!!
0,I love these slippers!!!  They fit perfect!!  Cool style too.
0,HOT HOT HOT! Wore this to Vegas - The front of this top is classy and refined - and a little naughty in the back. Great top
0,a tad long so I gave it to a friend
0,I like these sneakers a lot - very comfortable, and look great. The only drawback for me is that the toe box is a bit wide for my taste - I prefer a narrower fit. I'm keeping them anyway, but will probably go back to my asics fit-sana when I wear these out. Nothing against these sneakers at all, just personal preference.
0,I bought these back in 2012 and they are THE softest and warmest socks I own. I've bought so many different thigh highs from another company and they were all rough and tight, in comparison, these are the best.	They fit my thighs very well (sorry I don't have a measuring tape or string handy to tell you the size of mine), and don't roll down as long as they are cuffed properly. They stay up pretty well, too! They are very long also! Perfect for someone with long legs (not me, I just like having enough sock to cuff them.)	They also are really great in the winter when I wear them like a nerd underneath my jeans. (Also very good under skirts in winter, a good excuse to look cute and stay warm!)	Also, I've just noticed that these socks have come back! I'm going to definitely order some more while I can! My original white ones have held up very well in the two years since having them and wearing them often (thankfully no holes at all!!), but it is definitely going to be nice to get a fresh pair!
0,So cute and comfortable. My got them in pink and I am 47.  I wear jeans for work and these jazz up things so I'm not in stuff old sneakers.
0,Nice size.  Perfect color. Can wear with anything.  Love the cross body advantage.
0,Great
0,Fit great, look great ,,,,,are perfect!!! thanks
0,Nice underwear. Ordered 10 pair but got a bonus package of 12 pair. Very pleased
0,Extra warm, just what I was looking for.  They are thick and comfortable and the fit is perfect.  It is hard for me to find winter cotton socks that are warm enough.  These are perfect.
0,Lovely, delicate and pretty!
0,Bought these for my mom.  The velcro offers ease of putting on.  The are comfortable and my mom loves them!  The leather has a high shine and look very nice.  The quality is excellent!  I would buy again
0,Im 5 feet tall and 125lbs. I ordered size Medium and it fits fine except for a little bit loose on the top, since I not a big chested girl. Otherwise the dress is nice.
0,More beautiful in person. All potter fans will love, goes with everything. Not too heavy or suffocating.
0,It's good...I bought this shirt to wear under my low cut and sleeveless shirts so it does the job very well..
0,Awesome Sandals
0,it  is  okey. I bought it for my mother in law.i think she don't like it.hehe may be I will not buy shoes online
0,OMG!!!! These wedges are beautiful, comfortable, reasonalble, hip, and classy!!! If you are looking for a sandal to match your pewter, silver, or grey handbag, this is the one.  If you have wide feet, this is the one. My size usually range from a 9 to 10; depending on how the shoe is made.  This sandal fits me perfectly in a size 9.5!! And boy did I receive it fast!!! Thank you AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!
0,These boots fit good and look good!!!!
0,I LOVE this suit!!! It is flattering and fits exactly how I wanted it to! I would recommend this suit to others!
0,My grandson loves the mask!  It kept him warm and snug on very cold and windy days shoveling snow!
0,a litttle too large
0,Good product just too big
0,Honestly I didn't expect these to be as awesome as they are. It's not cheap hosiery. The fence net, is made of a thicker hose material, so I expect these to last a while! The black was perfect, which was what I was looking for, the second pair was just a perk for me, but they are definitely neon pink!!! I will be looking for something to match the pink ones!!! I would recommend this item. I also got them quickly! Fast shipping is always a plus because anticipation kills me!
0,I buy lots of Croc's here.  Since they are made in China you would think they would be cheaper in Asia.  You would be wrong.  Buy them here before you travel.
0,Cute n sexy
0,These Arrow shirts and beautiful.  I am a Large Tall and found that I have to wash them so that they can shrink to the right fit.  Excellent quality and value.
0,I bought this for my son for Christmas because he's a Naruto fan. I was really impressed when I opened it. It's a quality item that will ultimately make a great collector's peice. The fact that it's well-made also creates a real and authentic feel that supports a kid's creative imagination. As for Mom -- I love it when I don't have to feel I've wasted money on cheaply made toys. Bravo!
0,This is the perfect dress.  If only they came in more colors
0,good quality fit perfect
0,A liiiiiittle small, but SUPER cute!
0,I need a necklace extender to wear it.
0,My 10 year old loves converse and gray matches with everything!
0,My favorite
0,very nice
0,Very cool little bracelet!
0,Nice fit and stylish
0,Great boot
0,The absolute best part of the heels was the buckle. It wasn't even a buckle; more like a clip. It takes 2 seconds to put them on! The heel height was perfect for me. The color matched the online picture too!
0,She loved it!  It was a bit heavier fabric than I expected, but it will be perfect for fall.
0,Good
0,T-Shirt was just okay....mask has a chin strap that my husband decided to cut off...overall it was a good costume
0,I love these and I absolutely will be purchasing more!
0,Pretty shoes and are cofortale
0,... it work's as intended.
0,great shoe
0,very comfortable. leather is thick, soft, and buttery. i wear 6 to 6.5 and usually get 6.5 in boots; i ordered the 6.5 and they fit perfectly. they also felt broken in the first time i put them on. waterproofed with ll bean waterproofing product. i do wish the heel were a little bit higher.
0,These are my favorites for packing! Ultra light weight and nearly see thru.
0,Perfect daily wear to the office earrings.
0,I am a nurse, working 12 hour shifts, best shoes I have EVER owned....and brother, after 25 years, I have tried them all.
0,Not a bad product for the money!  Thumbs up!
0,Love, love these shoes.  So comfortable and eye catchers. I have wide toe area and these fit perfectly.
0,The necklace is very attractive, and an ideal length.  My wife loves them, 'nuff said!
0,Sweet , Very Nice Fabric ! Super Soft !! I recommend authentic !!! I will order again !!! Great quality !!!!!
0,My kindergarten son uses this bag.  I imagine it is a good size up to 2nd grade. After that age, it wouldn't look right.		Pros--	High quality materials, different cloth is used and stitched together to make Scooby soft.	2 pockets on front, and full large compartment as well.	Comes with small water bottle and pouch on side.	Other kids will notice this bag.		Cons--	Just for early elementary school years. (too large for preschool)		Moral of the story--	The perfect school bag for early elementary school aged kids who like Scooby Doo.
0,Super classy,it's the most classy watch I have that's under $100. Beautiful look and touch overall very happy.
0,Love them!	They are perfect as I live in "sunny" Florida, where summers are really monsoon season.  Easy slip on and off, keep them by the door for dog walking on wet days.
0,the color and the material were just what i was looking for. warning theses shoes are not for heavy walking.
0,Great fitting pants and nice material well made!
0,Simply beautiful
0,I have quite a few hats and I have to say this is now one of my favorites.  The hat is made in China and is 35% Cotton and 65% Polyester.  The tag states that it is 57cm.  The hat came folded up in a plastic pouch, but quickly took its shape with no creases or wrinkles.  The hat is a nice brown color which is perfect for fall.  The material is very soft.  There is a brown ribbon trim around the brim and the ribbon and tulle flower detail is very pretty.  The flower is the same brown ribbon as the trim and the tulle is black with black polka dots.  I really like this hat and Im sure it will become my go to hat for fall.	I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
0,EXCELLENT tie dye shirt. LOVE it. Great color and very comfortable, soft fabric. Will buy MORE!
1,Super cute and fit nicely which is the reason I gave stars. Unfortunately you get what you pay for. Generally speaking, cheap, throwaway clothes aren't cheap in the long run. Poorly made clothing with thin material wears out faster and requires you to spend time and money repairing or replacing it.
1,These are the worst. I thought based on the reviews I would be ok switching from Brooks to these...bad idea. They are not comfortable or do they have good support. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on a two bit crap shoe. If you actually like running and feeling your feet at the same time I would suggest investing in something MUCH BETTER!
1,very big for ears
1,I read other reviews and based on that I ordered one size smaller ( I wear large, I ordered med), it way to small for me AND it is really really short. This is a short-short good for teenager not mature women.	I am sure it look good , if it fits right, they are very very light, the back pocket is very small, you can not put iphone in there, just enough room for car key.
1,I ordered 7.5 for women.  As it is unisex I got 7.5 but for men.  When I read the label it says 26 cm in metric, my daughter is 25 cm.  She lives in Mexico and we realized this issue there.		So if you order for men, stay on the size.  If you order for women need to go downsize 1 or 1.5.
1,These tights are like 2 sizes smaller than stated.
1,Fit way small and too  much bling for me
1,I give it 2 stars because it IS a really pretty ring- clean looking, sparkly, fun- but it arrived missing a stone. Dang.
1,I find that these have an uneven fit, the material is very thin and overall Not the most comfortable, will not by again.
1,Too tiny, almost slip all the way through the piercing.
1,I am giving this 1 star because the photo you are seeing of this shoe is a stolen CL photo of their $800 So Kate shoe. Ladies you will not get the high quality breathtaking shoe. You will get a $20 imitation plastic shoe...and the heel is not as pointy nor as thin.
1,Nice looking shoe. The heel and front of the shoe are lined up strangely due to the angle of the shoe. This causes a loud squishing sound with every step. Im not sure if it will go away after the shoes are broken in. I have not worn these shoes in public yet because of the noise.
1,This shirt looks good, but the sizing is way way way off. It runs very small. I need to return it. If it fit according to its sizing chart, I would not be returning it. FYI. The large is a size 8.
1,Far too small, for the sizing it claims to be. Sizing is not accurate. Not recommended.
1,I measured my size via the instructions on the Moving Comfort website. When it came, the bra was obviously too big for me.
1,The cutest thing about this jacket is the photo itself. The jacket is poorly made in that the lining does not lay flat and causes the jacket too appear puffy along the seams. I ordered a large size and the flaps of the jacket don't reach beyond the outer breast. I guess the measurements were taken on a 10 year, flat-breasted girl.
1,These sandals fit okay, but for being a 9.5WW, they did require a bit of adjusting.  I ultimately returned them because they weren't as fashionable looking as I wanted, especially in the bronze colour.  They look like something my mother might wear.  The metal ring in the center also doesn't stay still and wiggles from the straps.  I returned the bronze and got a black pair instead which don't look quite as dated.  I don't see these lasting particularly long and I'm not sure how much wear I'm going to get from them since I don't think they'll be my first choice.
1,I oredered this shirt for a dad and daughter dance at school..It was not neon colored like they said it would be,it was also really faded over the whole shirt and you can tell it had been worn..There was no tag on the shirt so i know it was used...i would not recommened this company to anyone!!!!
1,It has an umbrella fabric material
1,These boots were delivered February 1.  I wore them for around an hour most days while taking the dog for a walk - until today.  Initially I was very happy with them - they fit well, were reasonably comfortable and a decent height for wading through the nearby stream ... however ... one boot started leaking just over a month ago, and now both boots are useless as they both leak and have developed large splits in the rubber half way up the shaft.  The rubber seems to be thin and fragile, not made to stand up to much at all.  Very disappointed ... and annoyed with myself that I didn't put the money I spent on these inferior boots towards a better quality pair that would last a lot longer than 3 months!
1,At first they fit perfectly, but after a week of wear, they're falling off my feet.
1,Very pretty, hoping the recipient loves it!  The recipient DID NOT love this! This was supposed to be a 7.5 inch bracelet....it's more like a 9 inch bracelet! Needless to say, it's useless. Wasted money. One star rating for someone not knowing how to read a ruler! I DID NOT receive this item at a discounted rate, I purchased it regular price as a gift.
1,was not true to size
1,Asics has changed their sizing. I've alway worn one size larger, than my normal shoes, for running. Now my toes craze the front and they are slightly narrower. I can put on my old worn out Asics, same size as ordered, and I don't have that problem.  I didn't have time to return them and since they will be only used for walking I will keep. Next time I will have to go to a running store.
1,Ordered a medium 32-34 waist or was it 30-32, the size chart isn't working now. This will fit a skinny guy 6 foot and up although a 6 foot guy will still have some bagginess unless they have longer legs. I'm 5' I expect it not to fit, yet holding it next to me with the pants touching the floor it comes up to my neck, that's how long it is, or to put another way, when I wear it the legs extends well over 1 foot. Other than that the materials seem like quality and there are no problems with the construction other than it's for guys who are over 6 foot, this medium will be perfect for guys 6.5 to 7 foot.
1,This colour is awful. I look like a soldier
1,Too small.
1,Too large
1,Very thin and cheap! Not a flattering fit, because of its shape. Cheap
1,Make sure you scroll way down on the size list to pick the correct size or else you'll be sorry.
1,RETURNED
1,I bought these because I had a pair from a few years ago that was wearing out.  These are made different and does not fit or feel as good as the previous pair.  I am disappointed with them.
1,Material easnt comfortable
1,Is too small and the material is bad looks like a diaper
1,Not every man is 140 pounds.
1,This may have been the best sports bra ever, but the sizing is ridiculous.  I am... unabashedly huge-breasted.  In US sizes I'm a 38I.  SO I ordered this bra in a 38I.  Bad idea.  The band was so tight I could barely get is fastened, and when I did, it was useless.  The cups may have fit a DD, if they were lucky.  The straps were so short the wider padded part sat over my collar bones. It felt like this bra was trying to mash my boobs back into my rib cage.  I couldn't get the thing off fast enough, and it was packaged to go back to Amazon immediately.  So disappointing.
1,Totally
1,I;ve been using various twisty, curly laces for many years owing to condition that makes it difficult to tie regular laces - up to now they have been nice sturdy thick ones. Could not find that anymore - this one is very very thin and will not hold - it got over stretched at the first day of use. not good at all.  I do not recommend this brand at all.
1,Too small. Dye comes off on hands and nails.
1,Cheap looking and the middle one is very green tinted. Sending back.
1,I purchased an extra large to accommodate my post-baby chest size (34 DDD) and it didn't even come close. I had to return it. The picture make it look as though it offers better coverage than it actually does.
1,Im sure this item would have been great, but the item I had received was a used item that had also been through the wash. Obviously care wasn't taken while washing and the colors bled all over the white parts of the panda. Not very happy.
1,I ordered these shoes because I thought I would be getting a quality product since they were Easy Spirit.  The coating on the fabric of these shoes started shredding off the day I started wearing them.  It got to the point were there was so many cracks that I couldn't wear them.  I called the company and did have great customer service though.  They credited my account and did not make a big deal about the issue.  Unfortunately, I would not buy the product again, but the customer service was one of the best I've had in awhile.  They were so polite.
1,Nice size purse, but as soon as I unzipped it, the straps broke.  It is not well made. The straps are week and  will definitely brake if you put anything in it. I think even in you put a small change purse the straps would not be able to support it.  So image putting basic purse items in it.  I cant use it but maybe my 12 year old can.  It will be a Christmas gift so I am going to try to sew it (or take to a repair shop) before I give it to my daughter.
1,the colors are not what they appear on the webpage... then it was a plastic stretch... whish breaks with daily use... not sure it was worth the price.
1,Piece of junk. Within 1 week the top was seperating from the bottom. A total waste of money!!
1,Had to return the shoes, they run at least a half size larger than normal.
1,So, once again sizing is an issue.  I do not know what they think plus sizing is but it is not plus.  First off I am 5'10, about 200lbs evenly distributed so no big gut or saddlebags to work around.  The waist is elastic and comfy but if I did have a gut it would be tight.	It is also made of rayon, pain in the can to clean.	I like the flowing look and comfort  but I will not bother with ordering any more
1,I wanted these to have the silicone to hold them up and they don't, i want to return them so i can get the kind i like not sure how to do that
1,These pants are cheap in price and in material.  You can see through it and the first day I wore them, the seam tore open....during my workout.
1,My initial impressions were this was a nice product that was comfortable with nice pocket placement.		However, at this point the provided belt is a joke and the stichting in the crotch blew out.		Super Lame
1,The shirt is spandex and was the size for a toddler.  Was really disappointed.
1,Way too large , I bought for my 9 year old and because of the reviews I ordered one size down and it's still too large that she would probably start wearing in 2 years , or I will wear :)
1,East west on me
1,I was disappointed with fit and comfort of the sole. My foot slipped around and it wasn't warm
1,I could never set the hands on the face of the watch to match the voice.
1,The lettering instantly cracked and started peeling off after the very first wash (in cold water as you should).  I could not use it for my Halloween costume as I'd planned.  However Amazon was quick to refund and I had time enough to get a better one from Dirty Ragz. True to their word the lettering was silk-screened and remained intact.
1,Had to return
1,I really wanted to like these booties, but they were just plain awful.  I tried everything, moleskin liners, gel inserts, everything.  Extremely cheap materials made these booties very very uncomfortable.
1,This is a very poorly made product for the price. My husband and i are both sorrel lovers, however this product is flimsy and will fall apart in a matter of days. The sole started seperating from the shoe in a matter of days, the sole of the shoe is also extremely thin. These shoes will only work if you wear them inside only on carpet. Sole not thick enough for tile or wood.
1,way small for a 3x
1,Pretty much junk
1,This just wasn't for me. A bit too cheaply made for me.
1,Tailoring is odd and sizing was much larger than expected. My wife had this out of the box for about 5 seconds before she decided we were returning it.
1,They do not honor their 100% satisfaction guarantee or their money back after 30 days. I bought pants for Christmas and bought them just before so my receiver could try them on. Most wait until after Christmas which most companies make a time allowance for. Not this one. The pants did not fit so I returned one out of two. It was refused after I spent the money to ship it because it was more than 20 days. They wrote in 20 not 30 as their guarantee clearly states. I called and got an answering machine and was very polite giving phone number and e-mail address but be wary! Their policy states that if they feel any communication to them is not polite they have the right not to deal w/ you ever again. Convenient, eh? Do Not Buy From Them! They have yet to even reply to my complaint.
1,Nice looking watch, but it's obvious that the seller's unisex determination is off. It's more like the middle size of a man and woman's watch. Small face. Not wide base.  Cheap clasp.
1,Bought these for my son and three of them snapped within the first week. A month later half of them have broken so the product is useless. Too bad. Seem like a great idea.
1,Poorly made, the seam undid it self when I tried it. I would definitely not buy again! Too bad I bought two, after looking at the great reviews!
1,Usually love Merrell, but these were on the small side (& not too great looking).
1,Nice quality. Too big by at least a half size.
1,All Easy Spirits I have worn fit perfectly well in my usual 8 1/2 B but these run kinda small. Am wearing them but would be happier if fit was like my others.
1,Bought exactly the same pants 2 years ago but they have changed the model (but not made a new item in the store), so what used to be a straight, loose leg is now more like 'Bruce Lee' type pants on the calves, which I don't like. Once I wash them they will probably not fit very well.
1,Cheap thin material but if that's what your looking for then go for it. Bought them for the name for my husband and we were both disappointed
1,The product description states that you are able to adjust the size...........well, if you have a small head, it just simply does not work.  I may try the medium brim hat, as you can order that one by head size.  I desperately need a hat to shield by fact from the sun in the Florida Keys.  I liked the hat until I put it on.
1,RIDICULOUSLY OVER SIZED!!!!  Wish I would have read the review before I purchased!!  I ordered according to their size chart and the dress is like a muumuu on me.  I am a size 6 and the dress is for a size 16 or larger - not sure why this happened, but do not waste your time buying this dress.  AWFUL FIT!!!!!!!!
1,The quality just isn't there.  I probably would have paid $10 for this, but for almost $30 that's unreasonable.  For that price, real pockets should at least be there (these just have them for looks).  Thread is coming apart and honestly just feels like you're wearing a giant fabric where someone just stapled on some sleeves and slabs for pocket look.  It looks like there were minimal stitching on this product.  I don't recommend it - you can get a similar coat for a better price or quality elsewhere.  I ended up just throwing mine in the trash.
1,length was ok but very narrow  Had to take them off after a few minutes.
1,I have wide feet, but all the Teva sandals I've owned fit perfectly. These however, are way too narrow and the straps hurt and my feet bulge out of them. They're completely unwearable.
1,daughter didn't like how they fit
1,The shoes are too heavy.
1,These look like a Man Dress. I need to run in them, not protect my knee caps from sun burn. WTF who wears this crap...?? Think functional, not Funked up......Holy cow...Stupid comes to mind. I like the fabric, its just that these shorts are cut in such away as to be weirdly like a Culottes. I am not fooled.
1,Too big, returning it.
1,It rides up.  I just tried them on for 5 seconds and realized they are not going to work for my back side.  It rode up with me just standing....I didn't think that was possible!  I've purchased Icebreaker Hipkini and they fit like a glove.  I got the same size in the Hipkini as the Sprite but the fit for the Sprite Hot Pant was not conducive to my body while the Hipkini was perfect.  If you're on the fence about trying wool undies I highly recommend them, this just wasn't the right fit for my body.  The thing I love about wool undies is no odor and I stay dry....all goods things to have while wearing underwear.
1,you need big muscles to where this shirt to really fit because i ordered a large and it was like i was wearing a 3x if i ordered this agian i would order 2 smaller size than you acuatlly were
1,The wedge heel is too high for comfort on the flimsy strap between the toe.  Cute but horrible fit! :-(
1,Not the shoe I had in the 80s!!
1,The fabric was beautiful but the dress was very ill fitting! It's made for a tall girl with a long waist. I'm short waisted and it looked ridiculous!
1,TOO SMALL
1,Fell apart almost immediately. My glasses are small and they barely fit. Metal snap does not snap. No longer using. Terrible product
1,Large and the quality is cheap.
1,Nice blazer, but needed to buy 2 sizes larger. Zipper sticks all the way up.
1,I bought the chain and 2 bracelets however, these are so clunky and thick just like a mans chain.  Look cheap  Unfortunately, Not worth it to pay to mail it back...
1,Product too large. Has what is like a pin poking into my daughters foot. No response from company
1,returned these.
1,This is a long sleeve shirt not like the one pictured. Because it's the middle of summer I can't use it. It is also thicker/stiffer than expected.
1,I hate to be the one to be negative among all the positive reviews.		Yes, as others mention the arch support is really nice. You rarely get that with this sort of footwear.		However, the strap that goes across the front of the foot rubs the outer edge of my foot and little toe raw very quickly. Throw some sand from the beach in and it feels like I have some coarse grit sandpaper scrubbing the side of my toe joint.		Seems the strap should go across the foot further behind the toes. But if that's the case, then the sizing is way off on these. I wear 10.5-11 shoes, and I followed the recommendations here and got slightly smaller at size 10. Maybe size 9 would have the strap at a better spot and not be an issue, but I shouldn't have to go down almost 2 sizes to get it to fit right.		Wish I could return them but I can't since I did wear them at the beach and got them covered in sand. A little frustrating because until you wear something like this you can't tell if it is an issue or not, but then once you do, you can't return them because they can't have been worn.
1,top was too sheer, skirt too short, was not what  i expected
1,a small fit my 5'-1" 100lb girlfriend nicely. we didn't like how shiny the black was...reminded us of the matrix. will be returning.
1,I ordered these quite a while ago. The fit is not comfortable and there is a rubber smell that has never left. I would not order these again.
1,It would be cute but it's definetly too small! I'm 5'4" and 125 and I ordered a medium. Hoping I can return for a XL!
1,I own two pair and these weren't as comfortable, i only gave a 2 stars for style
1,I wish I could return this item....  It's not as long as had hoped, the seams are irritating to the skin, and this product is definitely not worth $40.  I can find similar items at Wal*Mart or K-Mart which sell for less than $10 a piece.  Very disappointed.
1,There is nothing wrong with this shoe UNLESS you have a somewhat narrow foot which I do.  Out of the box this is a very cute shoe. The 7.5 was the show size I wear and length wise it was true to size but just too wide for my foot.  I buy medium width shoes but this one on my foot looked like it was a wide width.  Even tried inserts because I wanted it to work.
1,Cute shoes however the zipper broke and opened on me during the first  time wearing them.  I am returning them.
1,returned them
1,I ordered a small but was sent a large. The large fit perfectly, oddly enough.	My main grouse is that the stripes do not line up perfectly so I would try to have it repaired.
1,Don't get me wrong, This is a very cool looking watch and is everything a Suunto is supposed to be. The problem, for me, was I found it damn near impossible to read. I get the watch, and I'm sitting on the couch with it, at night with a lamp on. I have to move the watch around and stare at it for a few seconds before I can see the time. What good is a watch that you can't merely glance at to tell the time? I walk down the stairs into a dark room and it gets worse and the backlight doesn't make it much better. I traded it in for an "almost the same Suunto" with a positive display and the difference was literally night and day. Before you buy this watch I would look at it in a retail store and see what you think. And yes, I did play with the contrast settings before sending it back.
1,Had to return. I cant believe these are all the rage now
1,Had to return. I always buy this model of shoe in the size ordered but these were way too small. Either Asics changed this model drastically or this was a defective pair. However site gave a full refund.
1,Very hard leather,  looks like plastic.  Color is very dark brown, almost black.
1,Although my husband tried these on when received after washing them they are too small.  We always buy Dickies and they have not shrunk before.  We will need to return them.
1,The lenses on these scratched so quickly they aren't worth the price!
1,and the material kind of sucks you in. But the color is a weird, washed out grey which goes with very little. I would have returned them but I went on a trip, never wore them and forgot them there. No loss.
1,if you buy this shoe make sure you get it 21/2 sizes bigger then you wear way to tight ouch
1,Awful.
1,These fit PERFECTLY. Nothing like putting on a good bra!! Only thing that was a deal breaker is the cup inserts. Somewhere I read you could remove them, but this is not possible. If you want to look as though you've come out of the '50's, by all means, this is your bra. Otherwise, it's far too perky for me.
1,So, this is nothing more than a green Venus (Mach3 blade-set with a wider head and silicone handle), marketed for men.		Pros:	It works (a few times)	The wide-flat head works smoothly over body curves (preventing digging)	No wire-strips covering the blades		Cons:	It works for about 3 shaves per head	The lubricating strips dry out after the first use and flake away	The lubricating strips work to dull the blades faster	The handle is awkward, small, and becomes slick in the shower	Blades clog very fast, even if only shaving light stubble	Cost per blade/shave compared to Venus or men's Mach-3 blades		I've thought this would work better than a "woman's razor", but this is nothing more than a green Venus (which are cheaper).  So, buy a Venus, and if you don't want the blades to dull as fast, use Mach-3 heads and go slower, being more careful over certain sensitive areas.
1,These boots are super cute, but I just can't wear them. I got them for work but they were so painful and I had blisters in 4 different spots on my feet at the end of the day. And they won't return worn shoes so I'm stuck with them. This was the patented black boot. I imagine the regular leather would have been more comfortable.
1,I am highly dissatisfied with this product it fits well but its not new its been worn before and it has minor damage to it.
1,Changed review honestly after a few times of wearing they're already broken and peeling
1,Decent quality but definitely order a few sizes up!
1,Wife put it on for two seconds and hated it. Nothing like what its actually supposed to do. Very loose fitting and is actually way to big. Its supoosd to be a shelf bra, not a cover up. Do not buy.
1,Straps don't seem to stay connected b
1,Returned...  The shoe itself is nice looking, but the fit was horrible.  These fit like a wide width instead of a medium width sandal.  Also hardly and arch support.
1,Purchased as a gift.  Chain hopelessly tangled on arrival.  Charm broke apart on first wearing.  Sad.
1,I normally love Ecco shoes.  They are always comfortable.  I've had four pairs of Ecco Biom Lites.  They're my favorite shoes.		Then I bought a pair of these 12 months ago and had to give then away after a week, my feet were so sore.		Went to an Ecco store on the weekend and foolishly bought another pair, thinking they were different.  They look so comfortable, light, and airy, perfect for summer walking.		My head had forgotten, but my feet hadn't.		My main complaint is that they rub terribly at the back due to exposed stitching and a thin unpadded back.  That plus the raised ankle padding that creates another seam to rub against.  It probably doesn't help that they are slightly large for size, thus my heel moves around more.		I'd suggest avoiding this particular style.
1,arms fit tight
1,They are really pretty! However, I can only wear a 5 1/2 in heels. I ordered a 5 1/2. But when I put them on they were too big! Fit like they were 6's. I looked all around the show for a size and couldn't not find one. I do not know if they are actually a 5 1/2 or if they sent me a 6! Plus they smelled like permanent marker really bad.
1,Always order the same size for my guy. First time ordering black jeans. They were too small in the waist. I missed the return time window. So disappointed!
1,They had seams (I thought I ordered seamless) and were very tight. I am returning them.
1,My daughter has mild sensory issues and the shirt is just too itchy.  The leggings are very long.  We will return this one.
1,Bad quality. Had to return it.
1,Shirt was so stuck to itself i couldn't even pull it apart to put on..  the inside felt rough. and the material seems thin.  wouldnt waste my money again.
1,This looks great when it is clean and fits perfectly and light weight.	However, we have noticed that it is causing chaffing at the ball of the foot.	Update: This didn't last long, fell apart within few months of use.
1,I've been wearing duty boots for a couple decades and thought I'd give this brand a try. What a mistake! The seams are sewn so where the material comes together is facing inward toward your feet, ankles and lower leg. They don't have enough material to prevent these unfinished ends from rubbing and as a result rub the hell out of your feet, ankles and lower leg. The padding on the bottoms isn't much to write home about either. Last pair of these I'm going to get and hopefully you will look to another brand and save yourself the pain.		It's now November 19, and I hate these boots more than ever. I had hoped they would break in, but they have only constantly annoyed my feet. Time to pony up more cash and buy somthing comfortable.
1,The shoe is very narrow and the "leather" doesn't stretch.
1,Took nearly 6 weeks...shipped from Singapore! Finally got them and they don't even work. Too wide. Not sure how to return them. I think we should be warned if a product is originating from another country before purchasing.
1,I had bad experience because I received a different product to the model  that bought
1,waaayy too large in the thigh area and I bought a normal size... Am I missing something here? Is this for plus size only? I'd say I have small to medium thighs and these were HUGE :(
1,I wear W34 L32 in Levis and this series. I wanted to add another colour to my wardrobe. These jeans fit way too tight. I wish that Levis would be consistent with their fitting and match their size chart.
1,I have had heel spur surgery 2 times in the past 10 years and while these shoes are beautiful, they really hurt my heels.  Maybe someone without foot problems could wear them but they are not for me.  Like I said, they are gorgeous but the heel area felt really hard.  I had to send them back.
1,These are great...until they break. I bought a set for my son, and all but 3 have snapped. They didn't even last 3 months! Not fixable, and now he has shoes he cannot wear because we tossed the laces that came with them. SO disappointed.
1,Too big, stretches out WAY too much, looks weird
1,Too heavy on the heel and hurts the toes
1,Once again, there is a disconnect in sizing... apparently 35x32 isn't the same in Mexico as in the USA, or Pakistan, or China, etc.	It's really tiresome to have to send back brands that I once trusted, but they have become completely unreliable.
1,poor quality
1,ordered a size 8, and I received a size 11-12. returning item.
1,upsetting
1,No arch support and very narrow in the toe area.
1,I was expecting white converse, I received converse that were extremely yellow-stained. Returned immediately.
1,Not comfy at all. Don't waste your time
1,Don't like them. I have quite a few Steve Madden shoes and these are the worst.	Wish I could return them...
1,I was so excited to see these slippers as me and my mom have bad knees, and regular slippers hurt. But we were very disappointed when they came. The colors are so pretty but the fit is sooo stupid. Its to narrow in the front and the part that goes between your toe is too low on the slipper leaving too much space in the front causing you to trip. Very sad, returned all of the 8 I brought.
1,This backpack tore up within one week of the purchase. It couldn't not hold the books my son has to carry back and forth to school. He is in 3rd grade and has one to two text books a day. I should have stuck with LLBEAN which is what I had to purchase again anyway.
1,Too Small
1,This mask is VERY claustrophobic and the weight of the material is very flimsy.  The "idea" of this mask is pretty amazing, but I don't think my step-daughter will ever actually wear it because of how cheap it feels and how hard it is to breath.
1,not a nice shoe
1,Very cheap, discolored within days of receipt.  Would not recommend
1,It fit and looked great for the first several weeks I had it. But after about 2 washes, the elastic in the lace completely falls apart. The little elastic strands hold up especially poorly where there's any sort of friction, like the armpit. The armpit area on both sides basically has a fringe of broken elastic bands, now. Kind of a bummer because it's so nice otherwise... but the elastic in the lace fell apart so drastically it's not something I was able to wear to work more than twice before it became completely un-presentable as an under-layer.
1,Cheap material and quality. See through material
1,Very cheap looking.
1,Had to send them back..not even CLOSE to fitting and I did order my normal size
1,Horrible. Turned brown and my wrist turned green. Don't buy!
1,This company is either making these in irregular sizes or mislabeling them and it not good at C.S. responses. Bought is in both black and white, same size. Black fits, white is too small.
1,Anti-tarnish, my ass.  These earrings are the worst; the coating, which is what makes this product a lie to begin with (they are supposed to be sterling silver) flaked off within 2 months of purchase and the earrings are now black.  Complete SHAM!  Do not buy these earrings.
1,I've had a lot of fur-lined leather slippers over the past 20 years.  I was really looking forward to these Bearpaws because of the rabbit fur on the outside and because I have had great luck with bearpaw boots.  Sadly these slippers are not great.  The exterior is crafted well but the bottom, inside lining is very thin and turns up on the sides causing much discomfort.		I bought a larger size as instructed so this is not a size issues. I'm really bummed.
1,Way too big 38 waist is 4 inches longer then Lvis 38 waist and legs 30 are 6 inches too long how can Lvis 38-30 and dickes 38-30 be so different?
1,these are so cute and i wanted them to work. they were too big and they don't stay on. they'd maybe be good for an infant who isn't moving yet. my 1 yo can't walk in these.
1,Gave this a low rating due to extremely short. Came just past my hips.
1,Ordered this watch as a gift to my sister-in-law for all her help during my wife's pregnancy. The watch came with many scratches on the belt. It did not appear to be brand new. It must have been either a used or display piece. I have purchased watches and never seen scratches on brand new watches in the case. Requested refund and thanks to Amazon Prime no hassle. Submitted negative review to seller and no apology or anything close to that. Watch out and be careful to inspect whatever you buy from here.
1,Does not fit if you got a big booty. Gear towards pancake butts.
1,I'm not busty, and this suit was terribly un-flattering.  Provided no shape for me.
1,I thought wearing this costume would boil an entire culture down to a racist stereotype. And I was right: Turns out, I was representing the culture in a super inaccurate and unflattering way! We want this costume taken down!
1,They don't fit....they felt like 30" but I ordered size 34"
1,I do have a wider foot than most, so thats why I posted fit as expected. Many times I have to return shoes, but these also didn't have much arch support. I do like the way they look, so if you have a normal to narrow width and don't need much arch support, these are cute boots for you.
1,Pants are too small!  Did not realize until given as a present,  2X is a 1X!
1,Ive been wearing regular cotton boxers for a long time.  These don't always offer the support I need, so a while ago I tried out more athletic oriented boxer briefs.  Initially I got Champion brand cotton.  These offered great support, but weren't comfortable to wear all day.  Mainly, they were too hot, the legs would ride up and the waistband would fold over.  I found myself constantly adjusting all over.  I stumbled across bamboo boxer briefs and this is the story of my journey to find a comfortable, affordable version.		I did not like the fit and I ordered according the size chart.  They were too tight and there isn't enough material at the legs for me to consider them boxer briefs.  To me, they are uncomfortable. Also, Ive found that I like some waistband thats not too wide, but offers more support that the rest of the underwear.  These didn't have what I would consider a good waistband. I returned these and my search continued.
1,These Tevas are just not the quality I have had from past pairs. They ran a little small for me so I had to send them back, but I am not getting another pair. I need a higher quality product.
1,I bought this item less than three months ago and it stopped working. I paid over $73.00 dollars for the watch. Amazon will not let me return it, since it is past the 30 day return policy, and the factory has a $20.00 "shipping and handling" charge to return it for repair under warranty, plus the cost of mailing the watch to them.
1,DID NOT ORDER THIS
1,I bought these shoes because of all the reviews of big guys saying how comfortable these shoes are. Maybe I'm just a much bigger guy, but I've never had a more uncomfortable pair of shoes. My feet are killing me after a couple of hours. I'm going to try different insoles to see if that helps, but as of right now I can't even wear them. This is definitely not what I was expecting from timberland. My Reebok steel toes are leaps and bounds more comfortable. For what it's worth, I'm 6'4"tall and 350 pounds.
1,I will barely wear these.  They have almost no support, padding to speak of.  Super flat and not comfortable.  And the front seam is so big it hits my toes and that is also uncomfortable.  I would send them back but I guess for $10 I got what I paid for.
1,I have ordered and will turn this item twice. The sweater was received in very poor condition with deep creases throughout. I would have to dryclean it even before wearing, if the creases would come out at all.  I don't believe its 100% cashmere, not a soft quality material as I would expect for this price.
1,These are way too big and uncomfortable.
1,These shoes look beautiful in person and although the description says "Synthetic" - it's indeed leather. It has the amazing leather smell and is well constructed. Definitely excellent quality shoes - just like my other pairs of Miz Mooz shoes.  Also, I am normally a 6.5 and these shoes fit as expected.		However, I returned them because I guess I have scrawny ankles and calves, which gave the appearance that I am wearing leg warmers vs beautiful, quality boots.
1,Loved the look of these sandals, but after wearing for a couple of months strap between the toes pulled out. Just don't think	they are constructed very well. Really disappointed and would never buy this brand again.
1,Another cheap china-buy. Bad material, and much larger than it looks. I gave it to Goodwill.
1,It is really just a long T-Shirt with a cheap looking belt. Runs small, I returned it.
1,Very uncomfortable shoe.
1,Don't purchase unless you just don't want your money!
1,Poor quality. Color faded away after just 2 washes.
1,Even with the "bigger" sizes, they're still way too small and I normally wear an XL or XXL in pants/leggings.
1,I've seen these before and love the look but this particular one had a toe strap that was too long.	Unfortunately, there's no way to adjust any of the straps because they're cut and then glued into the sole -- the straps LOOK adjustable but only can be adjusted around the ankle.		The ankle strap was WAY too long and I had to cut my own holes -- and I Have pretty big feet (10.5 to 11.0).  Sizing is a bit small, I'm really a 46 and this fit just right at 42.		Wouldn't buy this again unless I had a chance to try it on first.
1,The size is great but it the material is awful. It is stiff and thin feels like a cheap table cloth. The pattern is nice but there was a huge flaw on the back. I will NEVER it is I am so disappointed.
1,Glasses were scratched both times I ordered.
1,too small
1,Ordered this in the size I normally wear, but it was too large in the bust area.  Sent it back, but may reorder in a smaller cup size.  Well made, but just didn't fit as expected.
1,color in real life is not the same as in the picture and the size runs small
1,The large size was more like a small or medium. These did not fit at all, unless you have a 20inch waist !
1,I wear a 10. Every shoe I own is a 10, except maybe one or two pair that are 9.5. So why did this size 10 hurt my feet? Because they were too small and tight. My toes were numb after 10 minutes! Returned for a full refund.........
1,The description of the article was not accurate.  It said the jacket measured 30 in from mid back.  It was not nearly that big.  My husband is 6"4 and the jacket barely fit. I ordered a 2XL.  The sleeves were too short as well.
1,I GOT ONE OF THESE AND ONE TWIST BALL ON A CHAIN, WHEN I BOUGHT TWO OF THE SAME FOR MY TWINS AND WAITED EXTRA DAYS TO GET THIS ORDER AND HAVE PICS ON FRIDAY!!!!!!! I HAVE ONE NECKLACE AND ONE 'BOXED BALL ON A STRING CHAIN'  THAT IS ALL KNOTTED UP, WHO WOULD WANT THAT??????? I NEED TWO OF THESE!!! PER THE TITLE I THOUGHT THEY CAME WITH MATCHING BRACELETS TOO, SO I ALREADY FEEL CHEATED, YOU NEED TO REVISE THAT FOR BUYERS TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND, BUT THIS IS A SCREW UP THAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE RECTIFYING SO I CAN CHANGE THIS REVIEW AND BE HAPPY!!!!!! NOOO NEED FOR THIS. I CAN SHOW A PIC AND IT'S RIDICULOUS!!!
1,I think it was just this pair - they said Mens 7 but they didn't look it.  I bought for my son, and I wear a 7.5 in Nike, and they were just too small and narrow.  They didn't come in a Nike box, so it is possible they came from a factory reject store.  My son's youth size 6 fit him great and he loved them, but these men's 7's just didn't work for him.  Two stars instead of one because of his earlier pair, which I would have rated a 5.
1,First of the tracking system was a joke when i checked on amazon it said it came last week but came today. So that was draining. Then when it arrived ITS NOT even CLOSE to what the picture shows. The color was more of a faded purple. Its was NOT SHEER or even a nice fabric it was cheap. I bought a lot of things from this company and this was the only problem I've had but this was also the only one that came from China. A complete waste of time and money.
1,Cheap looking, would not buy again
1,I need padding in the front of my shoes and these Propet sneakers don't have it at all.  I own quite a few pairs of Propet and will continue to buy other styles of Propet but these shoes feel as if the front of your foot is walking directly on the ground.  The pros-shoes are cute and light weight.  I returned them.
1,Did not like this, the color in the picture is way different then the actually belt.  The one in the picture looks distressed, the one I got looks like an over-washed suede
1,I have a brown pair that fit very well.  I ordered a black pair and was very disappointed with the fit.  Visually narrow compared to the same sized brown boots.  The fit was too tight both length and width.  They are being returned.  Unfortunately, I have to pay return postage.  I will not order shoes again without a free return policy.
1,There are slits on both sides of the pant legs which makes the legs extra wide. I didn't like that.
1,No stars if I could !!! They came in like trash! Excuse my language but it's crazy when I got them it looked like a dog got ahold of the feathers and stuff also you can see right through them and see the cardboard it was made from... but did get the free halo... I think the reason why is bc how bad this looks!!!! I can't believe I spent around $40 for this! Also the packaging was soooooo bad!!!!
1,A very cheaply made whatever it is. What I received is not what was described. Returned the same day it came in. Would not recommend to anybody.
1,I revived 3 watch I ordered out of 3 one doesn't work at all ...	Still looks grt for this price
1,Cheap quality. Cracked on arrival.
1,The lens tint is quite lite, and not reflective as shown on pic. Too transparent in essence.
1,There is a lot to like about these shoes: design, materials, looks etc.  But the toe box is too big but the rest fits well - recommend going down a size but then it will be too snug on the width - so frankly this shoe does not fit... !
1,Ive always worn Levis but hadnt had a pair of button fly 501s since college. I was excited when my wife got me a pair for Christmas.  They fit me better than any jeans but the second time I put them on a belt loop has already torn loose. Really poor craftsmanship, I guess thats why kids buy the $180 pants now, is that what you have to pay for proper stitching?
1,This the second package of these socks I received. Please note the size. First order I called and told Amazon I got the wrong size. The second order came and they are also the wrong size. I did not call the second time because it is not worth the hassle. I figured out that I would keep getting the wrong ones.  What they are sending is shoe size 6-12 which is a sock size 10-13. I was ordering these for myself, but they ended up going in my husband's sock drawer.  At the same time I ordered him a package of white ones in the larger size. They were the correct size. What I think happened is the packages are mismarked, listing shoe instead of sock size. That would be fine if you could tell before you order. Still love the socks, they are so soft and cushiony, just wish I could get in my size.
1,false advertisement- thought these were made in USA but they're made in China ... update, one year later they fell apart ...
1,I got a different product
1,Very uncomfortable..would not buy again
1,Returned.  It was tighter than expected even though I ordered a size up but so long it came down to my ankles.  Even with the scrunching it just didn't look right.
1,Terrible. You get what you pay for. Not good for cartilage ring at all. Couldn't get it I myself had to have my sister help me. A couple hours after wearing I lost one of the closed pieces. Terrible.
1,i got this shoe yesterday. cant wear it at all..too small! but the quality was ok..not to mention that i can't put it on...for those going for this product pls order half to one size larger.i usually wear a 8.5 US but order half a size larger as i've read the comments about some mentioning it small in size..but it was not enough for me..shld have gotton a size 9.5 or 10 US. A pity cuz i reali liked the shoe.
1,A little too baggy in the legs.
1,Too tight in the thighs, and much shorter than other jeans of the same dimensions.
1,Broke immediately, didn't even wear once.
1,I thought the length was fine but not wide enough for being a wide width shoe.
1,runs very small. Soul of shoe is very thick, not ideal for growing feet.
1,I ware playtex bras and this one was cut a little small.
1,I wanted a cotton knit shelf bra cami for soft supportive sleep. I ordered the same size in two different colors and they both fit differently. On one the underarm area and neckline gapped too large but the body was slim. Even though I ordered the largest size I felt these were too clingy for me, I returned them both.
1,Too large. They do not look like what is pictured. Would sent them back if it wasn't such a hassle.
1,I was about to buy these shoes until I realized if you compare the shoes to real toms there are differences. For example, the sign on the side.
1,I do not like it.  The lobster claw clasp is so small I can not even open it.  So unless someone else is around I can't use it.
1,Does not wick moisture well at all.  It leaves you with that undesired swampy feeling, plus the hole is more of a press fit instead of a room fit
1,I was disappointed with this skirt. The print at the waist isn't embroidered but a faded dyed print. The sizing is small if you are curvy, I followed the sizing cm/in and it is still pretty tight around my behind. There is no give as there is a side zipper and the material is Chiffon. There is also no underskirting so it's completely see through.
1,I love DV boots but this boots wasn't for me  It looks cheap and ugly. I returned .
1,Nice shoes but seem to run narrow.  Consider a wide size if available.
1,The first pair I owned lasted for 4 years and I wore them almost every day but I purchased at shoe store. I Bought these in same size & size was way off, left shoe smaller than the right shoe & neither fit. Quality control in China is slipping. These use to be great quality shoes. I recommend trying these on before you buy on-line.
1,I was so excited about this robe. I've been wanting one just like it forever! I couldn't believe all the selections. It arrived super fast, but then when I opened it, it had runs in the fabric horizontally and vertically. The fabric was also felt a little rough, the company wouldn't just print a return, but needed photos of the damage. I will say that the design and colors are absolutely beautiful.
1,Useless in the cold and not that good using it with my iphone because the touch isn't that great. It fits well and looks good.
1,Fits larger than normal size.  Added heel guards to keep tighter fit but not ideal solution.
1,Way too small and I bought two different Woolrich slippers in the same size and the other pair, Lewisburg Boat Shoe were a little big
1,I bought this is the Rose color.  The design of the wallet is good, and it fits all my cards. cash, and receipts.  I also like the layout of the wallet; it suits my needs.  Unfortunately, it has a very strong chemical smell that I can't get rid of.  Every time I pull it out of my purse, it reminds me that I need to find a replacement due to the smell.  I really did want to love this, but I just can't get past the sent.
1,About on step below foster grants...first pair of non polarized i have had in many years.  Don't know why I even got these?
1,Did not fit as I expected. Had to return
1,This is nothing but plastic. do not order it !!!!!  Very  cheap.
1,These are listed as having the individual waistband.  They DO NOT have the individual fit waistband.  I have had this style in the past and well, let's just say that they are less than comfortable on airplanes and in cars.
1,Poorly made.  Nearly see through. NO POCKETS
1,I loved the style of these shoes. I only wish they carried the wide width in this style, in a decent price, not almost $100! I ordered the 9M, which is the size I normally wear. However, these sandals were much too narrow for my foot to even make it all the way in. Too bad because I think they would have been very comfortable!
1,Very uncomfortable across the bridge of my injured foot. There is an odd squeezing sensation due to the mechanics of this shoe. Almost caused my chronic condition to become an acute exacerbation after only 2 wears. I do not recommend this shoe.
1,Underwear with no fly is annoying.
1,The costumes was damage.
1,I bought these for my mom who was having swelling in her legs/feet. She liked the Velcro part, but she said the shoe was to heavy, the sole is to heavy!!
1,I have had several pair of these jeans in different styles. I love them with two exceptions. They wear quickly and the sizing is not consistent...at all.		I have some that are worn out that have been too big, so I ordered the next size down, not ready for that yet...lol, so I reordered the size currently falling off of the hips...in the same style I already have....they were WAY too small and not at all close to what I already have in that size, even the pairs that I have hardly worn.		Not thrilled with my latest experience at all
1,I normally do not review items that have more than a handful of reviews.  I do feel compelled to review these, however.		I purchased these a couple of months ago because they were priced well, looked pretty good, fit my feet and, importantly, are waterproof.		Unlike most of the shoes I've bought of late, these Rockports were uncomfortable for a very short time before they began to break in to the dimensions of my feet.  My past few pairs of shoes have been from Allen Edmonds (Wilbert, Eagle County, the mocassin boots whose name I can't recall and a pair of Chukka boots) which doesn't seem to make a last that will fit my feet such that wearing them results in nearly unbearable pain even after many patient hours of wear in order to break them in.		Anyway, one concern I had about these Rockports is that the soles are implausibly light.  They made me wonder about durability and strength.  I got a partial answer today when I went out to inspect a blackberry patch that had just been plowed.  Something I stepped on, presumably a bramble, easily punctured the sole and broke through it and very nearly my sock and foot leaving a painful blood blister without actually piercing the skin.  I have to say that I have only ever had my foot punctured by sharp oblects while in barefeet or flip flops.  In my life thus far I am quite certain that I have walked, actually walked, more than other people my age by a factor of at least 10 on a variety of surfaces many of them raw and unpaved.	As such, I have a pretty good feeling for the stoutness of a shoe's sole; my qualms about this set have certainly been affirmed. The tear measures a little more than 1/8" across which means that the object was not particularly diminutive.  My point here is that the object appears to have been quite wide and blunt, thus the unpunctured foot, and I must say that the amount of pain I felt led me to expect a pool of blood when I removed my shoe.  This indicates a sole that is dangerously flimsy for anything but smooth, hard surfaces.		Under the circumstances, I don't believe I'll buy another pair of shoes with this particular adidas sole.	As to the uppers, only, these shoes look reasonably presentable, if a little cheap, and they are moderately comfortable with the promise of wearing in well.		Although I don't recommend them, I might not have bought another pair anyway having recently found the Vionic brand.  I'll be buying a pair of those shoes presently and hope for the best.
1,I ordered a medium size to allow for shrinkage, but the shirt still shrunk to less than	a Small size.
1,Weird design.  You have to wrestle to get into it.  Look at the pic of the back of it.  That's a clasp on the bottom and I'm not sure why?  You can't adjust it while it's on you!  It's hard getting into it.  The front fabric is NOT concealing so it shows the outline of EVERYTHING.  I will say this once it was on it wasn't bad but I felt like it was too thin in the front to wear it alone.  I'd want a shirt or tank over it.
1,cheap all the way.
1,Very bad idea! Way too hard to get on, narrow ankle/leg/foot. There isn't any structure to this item.	The foot area is very narrow.		I bought it as a gift and was sad when I took it out of the package. sadder when I saw my father trying to get the darn things on. These were a bad idea.
1,i ordered this watch box for my wife because she has a lot of watches. The box holds her watches ok and even allows for some of her thinner, rectangular pieces to be doubled up. The problem is that the interior is very cheaply made and in some places it is dented. The lock is absolutely unnecessary and doesn't work properly. It does hold my wife's watches, however, and that is why I originally bought it. So, I guess if functionality is key, this box works fine. If looks and or, security is an issue, it's best to look elsewhere.
1,Thought it was so cute and the price was right... But the bottoms were WAY too small. They fit like a regular two piece bottom almost. Definitely not like the picture! Super disappointed. :(
1,it was too short, she wore it once and we gave it away
1,Let me start off by saying my first purchase with this product was great. The necklace is pretty and holding up. Since I was pleased with that order I decided to purchase from them again. I ordered a bracelet for myself and a necklace for my daughter. The first day my daughter wore her necklace it broke and she lost her charm that she put on it. She was in tears when she got off the bus. I was able to fix the necklace with pliers. 2 days later my bracelet broke and fell off my wrist. I haven't been able to find it. Not pleased and will take my business elsewhere.
1,A very very tight fit.
1,Cute but not sturdy. My 3 year old lost one in the bed first night wearing them. The next day when I put it back in her ear it easily bends out of shape. Almost broke.
1,Very poor quality.  A big disappointment.  Provides no warmth as a sweater.  Nothing to recommend it.
1,Big in the ass but tight in the front. Shrank a lot after first wash. I only wear these if I'm out of clean scrub pants.
1,This sweater is poorly made. Don't waste your money. Hole in pocket and loose threads.
1,Since it doesn't extend up as the high waisted versions do, it creates a waist roll that then further pushes the panties down.  The material was also rough and felt scratchy against the skin.  If you like your material rough and have no adipose tissue around your waist, then order away!
1,The neckline in the back was sewn wrong. There were 3 pleats on one side and no pleats on the other. In the front, the neckline just puffed out awkwardly. I had to return it.
1,the color is wrong
1,So the shirt is cute, but it is HUGE! I would go down 2 sizes if you want to this to look nice, and not a trash bag on. Very disappointed in my purchase.
1,ill give it 2 stars, because the fabric is way too loose and soft, you could easily rip it if you scrape it against anything. So I'm super careful.	Also, there are threads coming out from all over...  def not worth paying more than 5 bucks.	the crown is pretty big making you have a very wide forehead.	beside of that, beautiful cap in a beautiful color - and it was the last one in stock so...
1,Very nice, medium sized wallet, with RFID blocking capability......has more than enough spaces for credit cards and other cards (doctor's appointments, etc) which I need.....a zippered compartment for money......three places for ID's or other needed cards to be easily shown		I wish it was NOT leather....but couldn't find one that fit my needs that wasn't in leather, unfortunately.....		ALSO:  having used it now for a while....I LITERALLY can't take the driver's license out of the clear window....it has no "thumb hole" to use to push it out, as most wallets do...and its in there so firmly I have to hand the whole wallet over to the cashier if she needs to see the driver's license!!  NOT GOOD!  Other than that issue, its fine, but that is a MAJOR ISSUE....would not have bought this wallet if I had realized the problems this would cause!
1,I got this as a gift from my mom. I liked the design and the watch part works well. I just wish that the paint job on the front did not look so terrible. There is red in the little center designs and the outer edge of the whole design looks like it got banged up. If you're buying it for use more than its looks then you are good, but if you wanted it to be pretty well then your out of luck.
1,Way to big.  Don't see how to remove  links. Too big for a mans wrist!
1,Not flattering for a pear shape.
1,There is a scratch of some sort right on the top center of the stone. Product arrived at a later date than originally stated. Nice ring but, its important to inspect merchandise before packaging. Will not be sending back due to inconvenience and will not be buying from this seller again.
1,I'm actually very sad. I just got this ring out of my mail box and opened it. On first sight I knew it was too big. I ordered a size 7, and it's a size 9. On closer inspection I then noticed that it was missing a stone. Where the stone was supposed to be the space was stretched out and bent. I won't be returning it because it was cheap, but I also won't be ordering from this company again. I'm happy that others have had good experiences with them and love their jewelry, but alas, I'm devastated.
1,I am so disappointed.  I have several other pairs of these and have ordered from the same site, however, these last two pairs I ordered, after washing are TOO tight where the others fit perfectly.  I am thinking they might be mismarked.  Very disappointed as I have already washed them and am sure I can't return them.
1,It fit my 10 year old daughter! WAY TOO SMALL
1,My daughter bought this for herself. The face was as wide as her wrist and very heavy. We had to send back.
1,Had an allergic reaction to the metal so if you have sensitive skin you might want to think twice
1,Absolutely not, feels as though I'm drowning in a black sheet or curtain.
1,I returned these shoes as they were very narrow, especially in the toe box. In addition, the strap is very thin and I didn't think it would hold up to frequent wear.
1,I love my boots but almost returned them for another pair as the stitching on one side of them is not right there is a coupe inches on the side seam that is white and they should be all black. I had already returned a pair of the taller boot as they were to tight around my calves so got the shorter one which I love. I guess I will just try to color in the stitching as I really don't want to return them again and wait for another pair ... even tho I still have not worn them. But I do love them! Thanks
1,Terrible color!
1,I don't think this bra is going to be worth the money at all. It fits okay and I do like the wide straps, but it has some real problems. For one thing, it's too thin and has no lining; it's very show-through, if you know what I mean. Also, there's a seam on the inside (where the straps meet the cups) that is irritating and itchy. I was looking for a comfortable all-day "working" bra, and this isn't going to be it.
1,To big...not exactly what I expected.
1,It is cheaply made and it is just sitting in my drawer and I plan to throw it out. That is what you get for the price I guess.
1,When it comes to shoes, don't buy something you didn't try!!
1,I like the long length but fit runs small. Size fits for teens not grown women.
1,Way too small. Extremely short
1,Was not true to size. Very small that's why I sent them back. Will not order this product again.
1,Did not fit.
1,These shoes are very narrow.  I have always been able to wear a 2E but they have changed the shoe so that the toe box is very narrow.  I even tried to order men's shoes hoping they would be wider but no luck.  If you normally wear a 2E you probably will no longer be able to wear Brooks shoes.
1,Had theses for 6 months, most of which I didn't wear them due to winter and the rubber is already splitting. Not impressed at all for $100.
1,The pair I received had no belt loops.
1,These sweatshirts are nice and heavy and fit correctly around the chest, and the sleeve length is right, but they are way too long in the body, and the neck opening is way too big.  I would not buy this style again.
1,returned
1,bent, was not round
1,I only purchased these scrubs because it was the required style # color for my clinicals. I typically wouldve purchased Cherokee brand. Since I have loads of Cherokee brand scrubs, I referred to my the size chart for them and then compared to the size chart for these. According to the size chart measurements I would have worn a XXL in this top. When it came in, I tried it on and it was huge. Not just a tad big, but huge!! I washed and dried it a few times and it drew up a little but was still very big. This top is normal length compared to other scrub tops, but it is very wide making your body look very "boxy". The material is also very stiff feeling, even after 2-3 washes. I am very disappointed in this top but I didn't have a choice in choosing what brand or style to buy. I would've have the product zero stars, but considering the price is much cheaper on Amazon and the shipping was super fast I did decide to give 2 stars.
1,Odd shape. Does not fit head right and dows not stay on, slips diwm. So pretty much useless for me. I will give to friend and see if works for them
1,The shorts were too large for my 10yr old daughter.
1,Very Warm.  These didn't work for our musical because they would have been to hot on stage.  I sent 3 back and never got a refund.
1,Not what I expected from Levi's, they are too big expecially the legs and I did not expect the button zipper which is too difficult to manage, I would like to return them if possible.
1,This necklace is not the best of necklaces.	The leather itself isn't actually leather, rather it is just leather-imitated plastic.	I tried to tighten the knots, but eventually just ended up snapping it into 2 rendering it just as a few pendents.		The cross on the necklace was bent when I received it, so i decided to grab a pair of pliers and straighten it.	It bent too easily as if it was aluminum foil.		I recommend finding another necklace as this will most likely not fit what you're looking for.
1,It's not plus sized. I got really excited thinking I had finally found some plus sized leggings, but no. I'm a size 12 in pants and they don't fit.
1,It didn't fit me
1,This shirt was very tight on me and I normally wear a large or a medium, depending on the shirt. It was super tight in the shoulder area. I loved the colors though.	It also came to me smelling of smoke which I didn't like at all!!!
1,I generally wear a 9 in boots and sneakers. Their size chart said I should wear a 7.5, but Amazon's sizing recommendation said I should order 8.5, so that's what I got. They were huge. Not just long, but really wide across the ball of the foot. The shoe is super stiff, the area where the zipper is bent awkwardly when I walked and gouged the top of my foot. Also, I'm not opposed to pvc shoes as long as they look nice, but these really look like cheap plastic in person. Big disappointment.
1,I have only been buying Burts bees sleepers for awhile and I ordered 5 this month and 2 of the five came with holes and broken zippers. I will no longer be buying burts bees clothing.
1,Cute but runs very small
1,They are cut low in the back and my foot slides up and down when I walk but they are the right size I really love the way they look
1,First off - sizes are Chinese sizes - about 3-4 sizes smaller than US sizes.  So it doesn't fit.		Second, it was much cheaper than I expected, and very thin.
1,Not enough to help with plantar faciitis around the house.  The arch support is both too short top to sole and to narrow side to side to support my foot adequately.  Still better support than any cutesy, cheap slipper, but they're going back.
1,Decent cap, but whoever is pulling the product for shipment is colorblind. 2 out of 3 Stone/Black arrived as Khaki/Black instead.
1,Titanium should be an excellent metal for a money clip as it is known for its high modulus of elasticity and high strength to weight ratio. However, this alloy behaves more like aluminum than titanium. It does not "spring back" if you pull it open wide as titanium should. Other reviewers have noted a propensity for scratching, which is typical for titanium and aluminum. Other than relatively small weight savings I see no advantage of this titanium clip over the far cheaper stainless clips available on Amazon.
1,these boots look nice but they are made of really cheap Materials after 2 days of wearing them seems like I have been using the for ever I would NOT recommend them to anyone  !!!!
1,There is no place for unfolded bills. I have to fold them up and shove them in.
1,The shoes were fine and arrived on time.  The size though was not good.  I take a size 12 sneaker and that's what I ordered, but these were too narrow for my feet.  I accept this though as ordering apparel online can be hit and miss.  Amazon has credited my purchase though and their return policy is great.
1,The bag is nice looking, but way to small to be functional as a gym bag.  If you plan on taking a shower at the gym (shower shoes, kit bag) and bringing a change of clothes, this bag is NOT for you.  It's a glorified man-purse.
1,I thought the shoes were gorgeous in pics but upon arrival not so much. They look cheap and flimsy in person. I'm use to quality brand shoes.	 And the fit was horrible. I felt a couple of steps would probably cause the heel to break. And my feet kept sliding forward.	It's listed as 4 inches in heel height, ...it's higher than that. I returned and was refunded my money.
1,I have been searching for a good sleep bra and have found it very difficult.  I decided to try two different types of Carole Martin Women's bras. I really don't know how to answer the size issues.  They both are too long in the straps...the straps are basically doing nothing.  Then the cups are too small...not adequate coverage to keep them in there.  I am returning both.
1,Very Bad
1,I wish I could give this zero star's DO NOT BUY.
1,I bought this and the adult size for my son's superhero day.		Unfortunately this hoodie is poorly made and I've been too lazy/busy to return it. Where the mesh part meets the hood, the stitching was not done right. It has a gap between the fabric (like a button hole) and came apart.		The same issue happened in the adult size.		If it was stitched right, then this hoodie would be awesome. My son LOVED putting it on - he didn't notice the defect and thinks it's super awesome he can "transform" into bumblebee. The idea of the jacket is awesome, the look of the jacket is awesome, the defect - not so awesome.
1,the lace that comes across the the stop hits not like the pictures show. It is right across my boobs No matter what I did I could not fix that problem. Also most of the lace on this is falling off too. very badly made. I also got no bracelet.  I am returning this one I would never buy from this place again. The attention to quality is not there. There are hanging threads, and really the pictures they show on amazon for this are deceiving.  Took almost a month for it to get to me as well.
1,I thrue it in the carbage,no good...i couldn't even give it away...way too long it didn't fit my watch right
1,Cute. Color was spot on. The legs of the dress were WAY to wide. I'm 5'4 and still had a foot on length on the floor.
1,I was disappointed in these socks,  although love the colors..they are really a weird fit.  ( they are	made in China- also disappointing to me)  I wear a size 9 shoe (fairly average for a woman) and although they got on,  it was like they are not made correct.  I am going to give them to my daughter who has smaller feet and see if maybe its better for her.  I might update this after her opinion.
1,good
1,I really liked this nursing tank,  however mine did not come with straps!  Have to return it. I am so disappointed!
1,I don't know who designed these, not sure what they were thinking. I mean, you can wear moon boots and still get these pants on. The legs are wide, WIDE, WIDE!!! Had to send them back- i mean, i know it says 'classic' fit and not 'slim' but seriously? Who could wear these with a straight face. Maybe i should just stop buying clothes on the internet.
1,The pockets are these are too small and WAAAY too high! they scream mom jeans! Pockets set too high are super unflattering for one's rear view.  Also the legs are NOT skinny, but closer to a straight leg fit which won't tuck cleanly into boots.
1,Feels nice but not happy with the color. It is more of a peachy/salmon than a pink. The picture shows more like a hot pink thats the whole reason i purchased it.
1,I have seldom been so disappointed in a purchase in my life. I am having trouble retaining water in my ankles. I looked for a bootie that would fit my foot and not hurt. This looked perfect. However it was impossible to get this bootie on my foot. The opening is just too small. The product was purportedly a Mens XL (I had ordered a Mens's XXL) and there was no way that I could get this bootie on my foot. I don't think a twelve year old girl could get this on. Fortunately I returned the item and and got a credit for my purchase. I'm guessing this company gets a lot of returns. Looks great in the picture - not so good out of the box.
1,Ive had boots for almost two months now and boots are still not broke in yet...feet hurt and boots have already split. Cant return because past the return policy. Smh
1,The arms are very thin and it doesn't feel like a normal shirt..for 6 dollars more I could  get a Carhartt K128 workwear, so I did, I bought 4 more of the Carhartt,....now that shirt fit perfectly and was very comfortable.....I recommend the Carhartt Workwear K128 T shirt over this one any day ..
1,Do not buy this.... It's become a great pj but it's really ugly, cheap material
1,I have always wore a size large and when I received the item I just washed it assuming it would fit but it did not so I guess I am stuck with it. Item is extremely baggie in the chest.
1,These shirts were styled for guys trying to hide excess fat around their waists. Not for physically-fit guys with no excess fat.		I am almost 6'2" and a solid lean 170 lbs. with washboard six-pack abs and a 29 inch waist. I work out 5 or more times per week at a fitness club, and log over 5,000 miles yearly on bicycles. So I feel I've earned the right to buy a tee-shirt that fits snugly to accentuate the appearance of my physique.		If you have no excess fat to hide, then these shirts are NOT what you want.
1,My first truly negative review.	Do not buy this shirt for a woman! This was not labeled correctly.  When I purchased it, it said "Columbia Woman's Tamiami Short Sleeve Shirt.  It's also on my receipt.	The only reason I bought this shirt was because after ordering a different Columbia Woman's shirt, Amazon suggested that I get this one too. I figured it was the same shirt, but with different styling. Sure enough...they sent not a woman's but a MAN's shirt-- it's enormous, with buttons on the wrong side. It hangs like a circus tent.  Unfortunately, when the new shirts arrived, I only tried on the first shirt (a slightly different color of the same brand, and it fit fine and looked just like the photo) before putting them BOTH in the laundry.  Now I have a very expensive piece of useless material (over $50.00 with tax).  I see others have posted similar reviews-- which means this isn't simply a "shipping problem" but an issue with Amazon's computer system or inventory. and labeling. I'm a frequent Amazon shopper, am usually happy, and expected much more than "bait and switch."
1,Poor fit.  No matter how many pairs of socks I wore or what kind of insole or orthotic I tried, they were too narrow in width, too large in the toe box and too loose in the heel. I'm normally a standard 9 1/2 D in running shoes which is the size I ordered, so I'm not sure what shape of foot they would fit.  They are being returned.
1,Returned
1,Order a half size up and grip tape to go with them.  Adorable shoes.  SUPER slippery.
1,Wore these shoes for half a day and had many blisters. Had to run out and buy another pair of shoes same day just to save my feet. The leather is so tough and rubs against your feet in several areas.  Even tried adjusting the buckles to see if it would help but it did nothing to solve the problem. I have now waited too long to return them. Would not recommend these shoes to others
1,Way too big, even when ordering a size down. They were also not the shade of red I was looking for
1,This may have ruined a pair of Cole Haan wing tips and the Doc Martin boots have returned to original wear issues after one week. I should have spent more on a cream.
1,It's too bad these jeans have such a giant fatal flaw, because they are good sturdy denim and well-made.  BUT the front pockets only go up to your first knuckle!  They won't even fit a credit card or a coin holder.  I can't imagine what the designers of useless features like this are thinking.  Maybe they think all women are supposed to carry their stuff in purses.  I guess I didn't get the memo.  (To me, a purse is an albatross!)		So, unless you only ever keep dimes and postage stamps in your front pockets,  I suggest you pick a different pair of black stretch jeans.		(I want to make sure I p[oint out that this is certainly not this individual retailer's fault.)
1,I've ordered Redcap 36 W X 29 L in the past and all have fit and continue to fit just fine. Tried these Dickies 36W X 29L and way too small. I'll never order them again.
1,nice looking but completely tarnished in one week.
1,Like the material; however, the penis and scrotal pouch are too small.  In addition, the back leaves half my buttocks exposed.  Cannot wear this item, unless it is 20 below zero.	I have been purchasing underwear in size medium for the past 25 years and never had a problem.
1,Actual design does not look exactly like on this photo. I don't like it.
1,I am a distance runner, hoped to carry my Springfield XDS .45.  No go.  Will still use with dress-pants and jeans, but too much bounce for running and kept sliding down.  Might work with an even lighter gun.  I am sure I got the right size.
1,U would have to be only 4ft tall for this to be that long as the pic.  Bummed.
1,do not fit people with high arches
1,I've ordered 3 packs of these socks. Size 10.5-4....the socks should be 10.5 toddler to Youth 4. I have 1 child who wears a 1.5 and the other wears a 4. These socks are too small for both kids...because somehow you have toddler socks in these packages. The socks are awesome and the only brand and style my youngest will wear. $20 down the drain.
1,it does nor have enough hair
1,I didn't realize there were flowers on it!
1,This bra is VERY comfortable, but after only two wearings, it is pilling like crazy and it snags every time I try to put it on or remove it. Poor fabric choice for a bra. Will NOT recommend.
1,I loved this product at first. It fit well, and looked adorable! But within a week or two of regular wear, the leather tore at the shoulders and back. :(
1,Too heavy.
1,Not made well....when kids went to put them on, the frames broke off at the lens part.
1,Way too small by about 3 inches..
1,Horrible shoes. They had a big hole in the front so I can't wear them & they won't accept a return
1,It's kind of frumpy looking.
1,Bummed about this bra. Im quite large at the moment and i purchased the 44e and it is not even close to fitting an E cup!
1,Was very disappointed.  The clog was narrow and too short.  They were returned.
1,Too narrow
1,Runs large and cups are very pointy. Looks funny under running clothes. I should have returned it.
1,Love it but the strap broke after 3 weeks!
1,They must be smaller in the UK.
1,I normally wear 6 Wide, but, I ordered 5.5 Wide (based on the suggestion option on Amazon). Length was good, but, width was still too narrow; I felt if I went up to 6 Wide, the shoes would be too long but not wide enough so I returned them.
1,Taboo
1,Very bad finishing
1,Returned
1,cheap material....
1,Love the width and style of this belt but found the light tan to be more of a light orange color.  Not at all like pictured.
1,Cannot believe how small this tank is! I ordered 2 sizes up and still it would not fit! Seriously - it may be cute, but don't buy it.
1,Too baggy. Comfortable, but they fit too high, close to your belly button.
1,nothing like the picture, not steel boned, brocade is very thin, and the "cups" where the boobs are suppose to go is non existent. If you want a flattering lift for your boobs, you will need a bra to go underneath. you will have to relace it so it tightens in the middle. also its a ribbon string to you can not tighten it as you would with an actual  corset. It's a costume corset, plain and simple. It's what i bought it for, but you can get the same quality corset for $5 not $18.
1,Way too big! Almost fit me
1,Cute boots. They fit well, but the buckle on the back broke within 20 minutes of walking in them. The buckle is not well made. I will be returning them.
1,Bought at the end of November, I'm not a runner and I didn't wear them everyday day. I noticed the other week they are coming unglued.
1,Frumpy, lumpy, and very BUCKET-like. I took some photographs to show you, but I can't seem to find the share button for that purpose. How can so many people review this without photos?
1,Not happy : 1- Not the same quality as original " fruit of the Loom " - made of Thinner fabric,  2- On three imprinted 90% cotton and 10% polyester, and on two says 100% cotton 3- Received three dark blue and two grey (not 5 diff colors as advertised) 4- One of the 5 had many small whitish debris on it not knowing what it is !	I believe all is because the " fruit of the loom" not care much about quality, but rather survival of their company	using a cheap fabric not the same as I bought 2 years ago and of course having a much cheap labor country	such as El Salvador making these briefs. In a short term perhaps the management will earn money, but in time	as people not satisfied they have to close their doors.
1,Sent it back right away.  The top and the bottom don't seem to be the same size!  I wear a Large or a Med in most things and read the review for this item it said it ran small.  This was horrible.  The Top seems to be a small/med and the bottoms a med/large.  The pants do not seem to follow a pattern, the legs are sewn funny.  Tight in some places and loose in others.
1,I have 3 pairs of Crocs. All of them are a size 12. Therefore, I ordered a size 12 in this style. It was very small and narrow compared to my other pairs. The toe seemed more narrow as well. I sent them back and did not reorder a larger size because the style was strange with the narrow toe. I don't know why these were so different compared to my other pairsbut they were a big disappointment.
1,too big
1,Fit of the actual sandal is nice, color is not very attractive. The ankle strap is very tight and rides high which is not very comfortable to walk in.
1,Very inexpensive, so one should not expect much. Not something a would recommend. Not a great sparkle. Cheap looking. Save your money.
1,Tight fit, not as comfortable as other Nunn Bush shoes that I own.  Disappointed, so returned these.
1,Cute design, but doesnt come close to a U.S size chart. Because Im flat footed I usually buy a full size bigger, but just to be on the safe side I ordered an 8 instead of a 6 1/2, but it was so small when I compared it to my size 7 sketchers it really looked like a 4 1/2. Hopefully they step up on the packaging because one shoe was in a clear ripped bag and the other just freely in the white UPS bag. No bubble rap or packaging effort at all. Printed a return label within 2min after getting them.
1,These leggings look a bit transparente. They lose some color when worn. The girls had to wear panties with no figures because of how transparent they were.
1,Great for one time use. Glitter did get everywhere, even though we shook it out when opening the package (outside). On second wear (did not wash) the dress strap threading unraveled/broke. Poorly made.
1,big chested ladies, not so much.  no support.  The bottom was ok, but a bit large.
1,Don't bother ordering this.  Not only does it run very wide, the workmanship is poor. The one I received had broken stitching .
1,The watch band is plastic and it just broke.  I didn't bump it on anything or drop it it fell apart.  I paid,$60+ for this and it's useless.
1,Sorry I returned them...
1,I've made an order of Levi's Men's 501 Straight Fit Jean, Light Gray Rigid. It took me long time to get to the package after I've received it, and I've been very disappointed that I've got Shrink-To-Fit jeans instead of Straight Fit, and they are now of a wrong size, and I have no time to return it. Although I like 501 model very much, but this one item is so wrong.
1,These are short and made with a cheap material that twists. Not much different than regular yoga pants, with a thin band at the top won't cover an expanding pregnant belly
1,Nice bras, but I have to return them. The bras are basically too large in the cups. I expected more lining in the cup.
1,Had to return them and order next larger size
1,I love the design and the color (patent). They are very well made; however, they are very uncomfortable. The design has stitching on the sides which rub on your foot and really hurt. They are kind of narrow too. Obviously, another person (other feet) may have a different experience than mine. But they did not work for me.	Luckily, Amazon.com was offering free return and could return them without problem.
1,All your other things I've ordered were great this not so much .materiel is stiff it runs small	Not happy with this at all
1,I returned it 2 o 3 days after receiving it. The quality of the fabric is to plastic. Maybe good for certain working environment  but sure not for office work or hanging around on a casual outfit.
1,This doesn't work at all.  The measurements weren't placed correctly on the stick because I measured my kids foot and it basically said her foot shrunk in size so I checked my foot I wear a size 7 it said I was a 4 1/2 to 5.  Not a good product.
1,It is not long enough to cover my feet. I was expecting a long beach look dress but it needs more fabric down.
1,Can't believe it, but I guess times change and as a CPA I understand cost and profit issues in business, but it is still sad that I tried 3 times to order my favorite Levis jeans only to find they changed styles and cuts amounting to using less material since the waists are shorter and of course the thin, light weight denim.  I would much rather have paid a higher price and have them left things the way they were, but I guess they would not get the volume of sales to support such a concept.  I dread having to find another brand, but have no choice.		Good bye levi's, after more than 4 decades.  I will miss you.
1,Smells horribly of plastic and chemicals! They look nice though. I have a short torso they came up to right under my breasts. The compression felt nice against my stomach since I just had a baby.
1,I bought them a size big because of the other reviews.  I'm glad because they fit, but they're too big.  A size down would have definitely been too tight.  Very awkward sizing.  I wear a size ten normal for everything else and a nine dress shoe and have never had problems with sizing
1,Wrong size and the box was trashed when I got it
1,totally hated the material this was made of. even my toddler as soon as i put it on he started pulling on it and trying to get it off as he started to cry. the material was very rough
1,Cute dress, but runs  ENTIRELY  TOO small.
1,I wear a 6 1/2 shoe and they are just fine, but would be too short for a larger shoe size.
1,Got the largest size offered. Wanted to look "fetching" for my girlfriend but will probably give it to her to wear-- just way too small. Beautiful robe.
1,Too small for an 8 month old.
1,OK so I bought this shirt and I loved the color, it's a great dark green. It's soft and fit well, but there is a problem. I don't know if it's just the shirt I got but the inside has this material inside that looks weird. Not sure if it's a manufactured problem or it's the way it should be but the material would cross inside in front of my chest, maybe to cover your bra? I'm not sure and I haven't seen anything about it in other reviews. If someone knows if this is the way it should be let me know. LOL
1,The buckle cut into the top of my foot severely.  Wasn't purchased from a Prime vendor, so I couldn't return.  Used bolt cutters to remove the buckle, which mars the appearance but makes them wearable.
1,No heel support; cut too loe
1,the color shown online is very very different in real life and kinda ugly and pukey. had I known I would have chosen another color.  otherwise the material and quality is good.
1,Really disappointed this time! I have been buying these Lee Carpenter jeans for years and have always found them to be durable and fit true to size. I ordered two pairs this time and one pair fits perfect the other pair is WAY too small. Both pairs feel really thin and I am not confident they will stand up well. Guess it's time to start looking for my new favorite jeans.
1,Although the color is fine, these do not follow the size guidelines at all! My d is 5"1, 110 lbs and a C/D did not fit all all!
1,Shoes are small.  I'd recommend ordering a half size larger.  They are steel toed and are heavy.
1,Not true to size. We have ordered 3 pair over the past year and only 1 fit in the waist
1,If the abs shell was so durable like the co says then why don't they warrantee the shell? Also why are there so many complaints (with pictures) of a damaged shell?	So you buy overpriced luggage, it gets damaged, the airline is not responsible for damage, the manufacture won't cover it under warrantee, yeah the consumer is the one left holding the bag, that doesn't roll because its wheel broke off and that can't hold its contents any longer thanks to the super strong lightweight abs material is make from cracking. Stop giving your $ to these crooks that make crap and stand behind nothing
1,The color was off
1,child sized
1,Not functional.
1,I bought a robe about 5 years ago so this time around i did not read the revious! Big mistake! The quality is bad comparing to what they were selling 5 years ago...the old robe was thick, nice and rich matterial! This is small, more expensive, and very cheep thin matterial... but they advertize it as a jedy robe from episode7 and too bad if you are looking for the old type robe...
1,Worst quality ever. They ripped he first time I put them on.
1,Poor quality and poorly made. Had to return
1,Nice looking, but run small. Return started.
1,Flimsy the frame broke
1,These are ok but I don't like the unfinished hem. Baby koala make nicer shirts for similar price.
1,Too small. I ordered a half size larger, still didn't fit. Over all lightweight.
1,I am a size 15. This product is just too small. I gave it away.
1,I am 5'4" 120 lbs and found this product to fit just fine, however it did little to slim me out as much as I had hoped. The material is breathable but quite itchy and not as supportive as I expected.
1,Was say too small!!! Poor Quality.
1,Did not like this chain at all.  Too heavy for the charm I purchased to go with it.
1,It shrunk by 2 inches after first wash
1,Naturalizer shoes seem to vary widely in their sizing.  I've ordered 4 different Naturalizer shoes on line - all 8 W - and only one actually fits!  Two were toooo big and one (this one - Alaina) was way to small.
1,good
1,The looks are exactly what I wanted and expected.  The comfort however has a lot to be desired.  It reminds me of a cheap water shoe feel.  There is no cushioning.  As soon as I got them, I went and bought the best Gel sole inserts I could find.  That helped a little.  There is no arch support and walking in them is like walking barefoot on concrete.  If it wasn't for the looks, they would go straight in the trash can.
1,cool piece
1,The fit was fine on the foot but the top part was a bit poofier/bulkier than expected. My husbands comment when he saw me try them on was that they reminded him on Napoleon Dynamites boots! LOL.		Between that and the weird melted-looking lumpy soles, I decided not to keep them.
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED .. I GAVE IT AWAY.. SIZES ARE REALLYYY OFF ... GET BIGGER SIZE
1,Ear wire broke the moment I took them out of the package. I like the design, so bought a wire to replace it.
1,Very thin material and cheap zipper closure instead of a button. Not even worth $5.00
1,The skirt was too small, but very easy to exchange for a larger size.  It's a beautiful skirt!
1,I really liked them at first although I wished the legs were skinnier but then through only a few washings the elastic started popping out in little strings everywhere.
1,Bathing suit came in a lighter color pink, rather than a dark pink as shown in the picture. Also, there was an odd dark patch of something in the crotch area when I got it in the mail.
1,Order at least two sizes bigger, when things are made in China it's always too small! The material is not the greatest but doable if you get it in the right size.
1,the size on this are too small  they don't come in other colors and the size tha they set is is not
1,I typically wear a 2XL and this was very tight for the loose fit as described.  Material is also very thin.
1,I visited a LEVIS shop in Buenos Aires and the 36 size fits ok. But when I bought the same pant in USA it seems to be larger and didn't fit ok. So now I have 3 pants that I can't use. I feel disappointed because I trust in the quality of this brand.
1,If I had young unabused feet, these may have been better.  Unfortunately, they're "wonky" and really odd fitting.  I am returning mine and spending the money for a trusted brand.
1,I normally get a 10.5 wide shoe, i figured i was safe with an 11 judging from reviews. I could not even get this shoe on my foot! Big fan of crocs and the original santa cruz, will have to pass on this one.
1,Yuck! The cheapest quality ever.. Omg I'm Shock at the poor quality .. It's what I would expect at a dollar store. Don't bother! I'll return them if they will do a free return. I hate them!
1,Did not like. Runs extremely small
1,Cheap, and broke very fast.  i would not reccommend them.  Also they fit rather loosely on the first wear.  Skip!
1,This bag is ok but it really surprised me because it is substantially larger than I thought it would be. First off, if you look at the product description it says: "11"x6.75"x 3" Those dimensions are not accurate at all. I am sitting here with a ruler in my hand. It is more like: "11 1/2"x7 1/2"x4 1/2". I was expecting a small toiletry bag but this is ENORMOUS! If their product description was off by half an inch off of one side I could understand that kind of mistake, but not nearly an inch all around.		There is no excuse for dimensions this far off, although I could see how most people would not care, and apparently if you read the reviews here, most people don't even seem to notice. I guess that's what happens when you give people free stuff, they tend to overlook the small details.		This bag is so large, I could use it as a small suitcase for my next trip. The middle section could be used for my toiletries, REI Multi-towel, shaver, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. The middle section for some reason is a little thinner than the opposite side. For the opposite side, I could easily store 3 t-shirts, 3 socks, and 3 underwear. For the section that has the clip, there is a section where I could store money. I'm not sure what it is for, but it looks like it would store bills really well.		I will hold onto this bag because I don't even think it's worth it to return. I could give it away, but I do see myself maybe using it in the future for a trip.
1,color and fake leather looks nothing like the picture.  the color is lighter, then the fake leather looks very fake and is very shiny.  The picture it looks matte and looks like leather even though it clearly notes it's not.  Had the picture looked more like what I received I would not have purchased.  With that said construction is ok although two weeks since I purchased and decorative seams seems to be coming apart; it has lots of pockets, I just wished it didn't look so fake and cheap material because it could be a really nice bag otherwise.
1,It wears in pretty badly. The build quality is very cheap. The foam insert is not removable, and didn't actually produce any support nor cushioning. The laces are also the cheapest I've ever seen. In the summer the cushion suffocates  your feet and makes them really hot and sweaty.
1,If you're looking for a sock to exfoliate your dry feet, then this is for you.  These socks are the roughest socks I have ever put on my feet. If I could have realized this before opening the package, these socks would have made a speedy return.  I would NOT recommend these to anyone.
1,came unfinished and very cheaply made, the string came separate I had to thread it myself. very unhappy with this purchase
1,Its a toy.  Cheap latch.  Thin not a good value
1,One of the earrings magnet already fell off. In the process of trying the glue the smaller magnet back on it fell in the floor and now I can't find it. The earrings themselves look very nice but the backings leave a lot to be desired. I'm actually hoping to return these and get another pair shipped back out...
1,Cute but necklace broke within 2 minutes of putting it on. I waited a very long time for the jewelry but it was worth the cheap price.
1,Its cheap and yes it looks cheap too. Botton of shoe is made of hard rubber. Leather stinks and feels cheap. Qualty control is horrible. Had glue residues all over. STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE WIDE FEET. Seriously stay away from this product if you have wide feet. Super tight. Its going back to Amazon.
1,A lot smaller than in the photo and the Stone came off the first day I got on
1,I'm sure the ratings would have been better had I been allowed to post my actual testament.
1,These shoes are beautiful and comfortable, which is why so many stars. Unfortunately, they are also disposable, so those who were prompted to give a review prematurely didn't have theirs fall apart on them yet. 3 wears, about 15 hours total is all I got before the bottoms not only came apart from the rest, but also disintegrated at the heel. Unacceptable material for the bottom of a shoe.
1,I am tall (5'9) so the fabric had to stretch extra to be snapped which made it very sheer. The fabric was sheer to begin with and cheaply made, threads were hanging off when I opened the bag. I would have to have worn another tank or bandeau under the top to be able to wear it comfortably but couldn't do that without compromising the aesthetic of the low back. It was returned.
1,Cute style but very lightweight and therefore see through. Am sending it back.
1,Not what o expected.
1,very rough and has a really bad sell to material
1,To small for the bride
1,Runs WAY small. especially compared to similar dresses on here.
1,Gorgeous bag! As pictured!	UPDATE!!!!! Learned this bag is FAKE!! A Knock off! This is a retired pattern, and it was not untilIn 2016 Vera Bradley started putting solid polyester type linings in some of their styles. Extremely upset and disappointed!
1,I bought this for my mother for Christmas, the colors weren't as vibrant as the picture.
1,I sent it back. I wear petite and it was too long.
1,I have been wearing this bracelet for 10 days.  I have to take it off at night.  I am gentle with it, but this morning as I put it on it broke!
1,Purchased a pair of Birkenstocks here and after a couple months of infrequent wearing, the cork sole on the back end of the sandal split entirely open and is no longer wearable.  I'm starting to think that the reviews stating that the sandals are fake may be true.  Furthermore, merchant never responded to my emails concerning the issue.
1,After having these only 3 months, the buttons don't keep the fly closed. I found out the hard way in a meeting when I looked down and noticed that my fly was wide open. Don't buy this garbage. Now it's too late to return them.
1,This is by far the WORST fitting bra I've ever tried on! They make the girls pointy, they face east and west, way too far apart. Just the weirdest look!  The seams  ripple like crazy! When I think back at how the bra looked on me I almost want to laugh, it was ridiculous!
1,I wish I could give a negative star.  This dress is 2 sizes too small. I am 5'6' 160lbs. I usually wear a large, which is what I ordered.  I would need a 2x/3x in this dress.  Dress is cheaply made.  It might serve better as a negligee than a dress.  Bodice is cut too short under the breast area.  Dress is too short.  The only suggestion I can give is "do not buy this dress".
1,I have several pairs of this Toms slip on, all in size 7.  Sadly, this pair of Toms, in black, is much LARGER than my other Toms.  Wish Toms was consistent in their sizing, or their quality control.
1,Runs small;
1,After a month the shiny color change.  I bought the set for my brothers and they are an embarrassment! Not good quality.
1,I thought the shoelace holders were Chrome, not gold, gold is tacky and ugly af... as soon as they came and i realized the shoes were gold and blue i immediately became disappointed... they have sat unworn in my closet for 3 months now...
1,I couldn't get my foot through the shaft, it was like trying to fit through a narrow pipe. Not worth breaking a foot trying to get them on. Not sure Frye understands the anatomy of a foot.
1,Don't like the shiny polyester
1,Bad quality. Not structure in the top very flimsy. Bottom way too big. I got a 3XL I am 165lbs 38DD 5'3. Very stylish and great color. Returned
1,looks so cheap and thin
1,Pants were slightly small; washed them exactly how the label said and they shrank.  they also shrank again the second time I wash them now they are way too small.
1,When buying the polo shirt, the header did not mention that it is Slim-fit. After buying in the orders screen, the name was re-written as Slim-fit. This is called CHEATING and STEALING from your online customers.
1,I absolutely loved these shoes however they were too large.  Returned them and ordered a size smaller, still too large.
1,The shirt stained my sheets black. I washed it repeatedly.  Still made them black.  Sheets were not easy to get clean either. Beware
1,Arrived broken and beads fall off.
1,The shoe was not the size had secure padding	on the inside of this shoe.
1,To big
1,does not look like the photo at all. Way to small. Poorly manufactured.	When I first opened the box it looked light grey with white lace trim.	I held it to the light and there's a slight purple tint to it barely. I put it on... With the underwire under my breast properly it didn't even cover 25% of my breast (way under the nipple). The straps are sewn on unevenly and looks like it will fall apart in the wash. I attached a photo of the strap. The bow is tiny and white, no rhinestone, top chest part is completely see through, this is not what is advertised at all. completely different item.	Will be returning immediately.
1,Very cheap. Very small.
1,They stink really badly and I cannot wear them
1,My normal pants size is 44, so I bought these thinking they would fit.  They are at least 2 sizes too small.  I need to lose some weight anyways, so I'll throw them in the closet until they fit.
1,Silky material.. Not at all what I expected
1,I washed my hands when wearing it, didn't even dip it into the water, the thing just went dark on me and "died"
1,Did not really fit.
1,I tried the zipper out to see if I could take it off that way. I couldnt. The zipper broke and I had to take off the inside zipper. Still cute!
1,Cute, not much arch support but not the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I've worn. The toe coverage is actually misproportioned which is incredibly annoying, as I didn't notice it until too long after the return date. Hopefully no on else will notice either.
1,very narrow in the footstep. very uncomfortable to walk cause there is not flexibility in footstep. Teriffic shoes which hurts my legs.
1,I noticed that there was a post for "Prime" and one that listed "free shipping" for the same price($24.99) but the prime listing had a higher star rating. They arrived quickly, packaged in a small plastic bag in a box. The stones were not loose as some reviewers have mentioned. The setting is a very plain prong/cap type but sturdy enough, not at all flimsy. The stones are a watery blue/violet with some sparkle, nothing fiery or dazzling but pretty enough.the size is good for a young girl or teenager. I bought these for a niece and misplaced them at Christmas, I found them and offered them to my daughter, she said she has seen prettier cubic zirconias and recommended I return them. My major complaint is that they have never been worn, were taken out of the package to be examined twice(once on arrival and once today) and the metal is tarnishing. Unfortunately it is beyond the return date.
1,I brought these slippers for my mom and ended up really regretting it. She wore them twice before one of them started falling apart .It is a cute pair of slippers but poorly made.
1,I ordered a 5X based on reviews and am a 12/14 normally. It fit great and I loved it so I immediately ordered another. The first time I washed them together on delicate cycle in cold water and I even hung to dry and they both shrunk!! I cannot even button them up anymore!! SO DISAPPOINTED!!
1,Too small and the seller will not accept refund
1,Too tight and looked rather unattractive.
1,okay....
1,Not enough support for 36DD, it was wishful thinking!
1,They are soft and comfy but first wash and elastic band came apart. So cant wear them
1,Looks great for the price however it was uncomfortable.  Especially at your ankle and your pinky toe.  Tried stretching it out but found it to be a little to uncomfortable.
1,Looking at the ad, I'm surprised I didn't see above "Size 9 - 15" to see that these are only 21" in total length. These socks don't even come up to my calves and they're so tight, a person would have to have no muscle tone at all from the knew down. And, of course, I washed them before I put them on and was surprised by the threads which were popping out the top opening when they came out of the dryer. $15.99 on Amazon Prime. I'd say you get what you pay for but I think these are more dollar-store quality so I didn't get what I paid for.
1,Too big for kids.
1,My daughter loved it for day 1. But I have to say the quality of the dress is so poor it only lasted a few wears. It didn't even make it to Halloween.  So sad
1,The fabric is very soft and stretchy. Not at all supportive, especially for nursing breasts. The band is very stretchy which allows for a great deal of movement. The clips to let down the front are so high they are difficult to reach. I sometimes wear this as a sleep bra, it is that soft and stretchy. I'm a 32H and nursing baby #3. I have used Moving Comfort Fiona. It's not perfect, but it works better than this!
1,super cheap
1,This set is completely useless to me now as the needle tips broke off instantly.  It comes with three and ALL THREE of them broke at the base while I was trying to use the tool for what it was designed for, remove watch links.  I should have just taken my $6 and gone to a jewelry store instead.
1,GOOD
1,Nice shirt but it is huge. I ordered a large but I would say that a Carhartt large equates to everybody else's extra large at least and maybe even a 2XL. It's huge.
1,The fit of these was unexpected.  I was hopeful the waist would be large enough.  It was, but the legs were oddly tight.  I am going to be unable to wear them.
1,I bought these for a friend. She put them on and tried to zip them. The zipper broke. You get what you paid for for these.
1,Less than 1 cm wide it looks like a string on the neck. Should cost $1.
1,Wears well. Brilliant colors in light. Does turn your finger green if worn on daily basis unmet normal wear. May last longer if worn only on occasion
1,I'm not sure if i'm just the unlucky one, but i just received my second shirt after having to return the first one due to a hole in the seam on the left hand side. I immediately check my 2nd shirt for holes... and sure enough there is a hole in the same spot. I think i'm just going to sew it myself and deal with it. Overall I like the way it fits and the material used just the two shirts  i've received with holes are the reason for the low rating.
1,Shoes run very small. Even on my narrow feet they were tight. My feet, especially my arches, hurt after I wear them. This was my first pair of Asics and I think I'm going to make it my last pair too.
1,Only complaint is how MY feet are shaped, which caused the shoe to be a little tight right at my bunion...
1,Nothing like the picture they are tie ups  not an ankle rap
1,Way too large and not very soft. I returned them.
1,The straps are at the wrong angle. Sometimes one strap falls or both.
1,clasp was broke even before I took it out of the clear package.  I was able to rig it and fix the clasp but it broke off around my son's neck at school.  I do not recommend it at all, very, very poor quality.
1,Size too big
1,These shoes looked better in the picture than on my feet.  The color is flat and cheap looking.  I am returning them.
1,Solid blue sneakers are hard to find and I thought these would be a good alternative. They look nice and it's hard to tell that they are not made from real leather. The insole is soft but very thin and offers no support. Would never buy them for the reg. retail price of 80 bucks! As usual, Clarks sizing is way off. I am from Europe and have been wearing a size 39 there since I was 13. Most brands convert it to a US 9 and that's what almost always fits well. According to the Clarks chart I would need a US 8. Maybe if I cut off part of my toes?? I ordered a 8.5 and the shoes do not fit as they should. My feet are neither narrow nor wide and the shoes are still very tight. Clarks seems to pay no attention to customer reviews because the complaints about sizing are legend for this brand. A bigger size does not help because the shoes will slip in the back. Never again!
1,Nope. Didn't fit like any of the pictured on here and is very cheap. Arrived with hole in the top and wrong size bottoms. Not happy.
1,Beautiful but the straps are made if thin leather. The main leather strap across the foot is not adjustable and very snug! It is obvious this is the weak point and so the sandals will break with prolonged walking or active work...
1,too big
1,36GG - Band is too large even on the tightest setting, cups don't offer much support after a few hours -- not a very projected cup. The bra feels fine for about half a day, then if you are projected the weight of your boobs will weigh the cup down and you'll end up with sad boobs and wires that are digging painfully into your skin. I also don't like the mesh insert at the top of the cup because it creates a bulge even if the cups are not too small.
1,These canvas boat shoes are very cute but they are SO uncomfortable. I tried them on and had to return them. I couldn't even imagine wearing them for longer than a minute.
1,Bought these, sent them back, lost money. Cost more to return than to purchase :(
1,weird material
1,Not the right fit.		I didn't want to bother returning it.  It might work for someone else to use, but not me.
1,I got these for my wife in a size 8 1/2, since the last 3 pair she had were size 8 and she wanted a scosh more room. She couldn't even get them on her food. Yes, I checked the inside and it definitely said that they were 8 1/2, but they were more like a 7 1/2 or 8. I couldn't answer anything but the first question, since my wife couldn't even get them on her feet. I'll have to send them back and get another pair.....not sure if the sizing this was just a fluke or if they all run small. May have to call first to see. Exchanged for a size 9 and they work great!
1,This was built for a freaking giant
1,Lame ripoff. It's what you'd expect for a $10 costume at a popup halloween Spirit store.
1,horribleeeee
1,The straps are thicker than actual pic! I can't wear a tank top because the bra straps are super big and thick and it will show.... the colors are pretty and it is a pretty bra but it is not comfortable and it is really stiff!
1,This necklace has a missing stone and I can not wear it. Other than that it would've been great. Thank you for listening.
1,I thought wearing this costume would boil an entire culture down to a racist stereotype. And I was right: Turns out, I was representing the culture in a super inaccurate and unflattering way! We want this costume taken down! Not only is a culture NOT a costume idea, but certain aspects of it are super important in religious and cultural traditions and it is completely disrespectful to think that you qualify to wear it.
1,Be forewarned.  This replacement band does not include the little bar that holds the band on the watch.  I discovered this only after I had destroyed one of the old bars while removing the old band.  So the band is now useless to me.  If you buy this band, be very careful in removing the old band.
1,According to the product information the skirt should have fit, but the belt is too tight.  Looks are misleading, because lthe string  does not adjusted the waist size. It is only a decoration.
1,The size/fit was right but, did not have the support I expected. Possibly if had underwire would have worked for me.
1,I wear a size 7 and bought a size 7. It fits large it is beneficial if you wanted to wear a thicker pair of socks. The boot also looks nice just like the picture. The reason why I give this boot 1 star is because there is a lump in the heal where the leg of the boot and the bottom of the boot are sewn together. It creates a blister and is very uncomfortable. I bought these boots a few months before the trip I wanted to wear them for so by the time I realized how uncomfortable the boot is, it was too late to return them.
1,Looks cheap, and one of my earrings was defective. The small hoop that the hook goes through was crooked and I had to use nail clippers to bend it in the right position.
1,The listing says that they have a larger upper.  The pair I received has an upper made of felt-backed vinyl, and the tag says that it's man-made.
1,Cheap material. See-through, way to tight and ugly.
1,Material is very thin
1,I returned them as the shoes wouldn't stay on.
1,It did not come with any English instructions so I was unable to set the time or date or anything on it.
1,Unfortunately, it was uncomfortable and not the right fit
1,kind of a pain to set and use
1,This size must have been a Boy's size 3. It seems like a Woman's size 5.
1,Pandora charms do not fit on this bracelet. I can understand some of the other brand sterling silver charms not fitting. Returned for refund
1,There is nothing wrong with the item, but it was sent in the wrong box. The shoebox had my size on it but the shoes themselves were two sizes too small.
1,poor quality, I wouldn't buy again.
1,Smaller than I expected
1,material cheap and thin. I expected more out of dickies. not the same quality I buy in the store. not worth saving a few $
1,material is cheap and smells bad !
1,My diamonds fell out with in a day of wearing. Totally disappointed. It is beautiful just terribly made. Don't suggest it for you.
1,Junk not worth it lint consist ly all over them all the time fslling apart already. DO NOT BUY THEM U WILL REGRET IT
1,A litter
1,I thought it is fleece so thin and size is small...price is high ...for this kind.
1,The watch works but the little plastic piece that fits into the holes of the band broke within 2 weeks of wearing.  The cost to send back and pay for shipping just doesn't make sense.  I may still try to return...just haven't had time.
1,very tight, mean very tight, if your fit, like avg muscle build.....this will not fit, I ordered XL. felt more like a extra small, my thigh would not even go through. I wear XL just to get it comfortable waist level for boxing shorts, Large fits fine etc. So that is just to give you an idea how bad these are. Feel like these are meant for very thin.... maybe 120 to 145 for XL.
1,Product was not what I expected for the price. Item was returned.
1,I ordered petite medium and they arrived as a petite small. I returned.
1,I really like these shoes initially, but I only had them for about a month before they started breaking. They not only got beat up easily, they did not fit right and did not last long.
1,I figured that since they are made in China that they would run small so I ordered them in Large for my niece.  However, while the label says 'Large', the shorts are about the proper size for a 12-year old girl.  My niece could not wear them so she gave them to her daughter who wore them for less than two months before the waistband shriveled up due to the stitching giving way.
1,These are absolutely beautiful shoes; construction, presentation (sparkly box), etc. but I wasn't even able to try them on because they were so tight and narrow my feet couldn't even squeeze in! I freely admit that since I had my children, my feet have widened and never gone back, but I am still pretty consistently an 8 but this size 8 was like nothing I've ever tried on before. So disappointing because they are so pretty.
1,HORRIBLE don't get it falling apart when i tool it outta package also way to tight around rib area
1,Very disappointed I ordered size 34 which is my size; however this bra it is very small, There was no mention that this product run too small.
1,Cheap cost -- cheat quality.		The clasp on this necklace was bent and didn't open wide enough to unhook!  Very poorly made and thin.  I thought I was going to pop it just trying to open it.		I gave 2-stars because it was cheap and I was luckily able to return it.  If you just need something that would be of no consequence if you lose or break, go for it.  But,  I would opt to spend more money and have something of value that will last!
1,This is obviously not a shoe as what I am commenting...this purse said it was grey and it is not...more of a rose color.  The inside is silver.
1,I can get into them, but they are a little uncomfortable.
1,Length was okay but way too wide and I wear a medium. Returned.
1,Don't buy it.  I followed the size chart and normally would get either a L or XL but decided to order XXL and I couldn't get it over my head.  The material is thin too.
1,The cup size was a full size larger than expected - had to return.
1,aweful. no hole for button and way to small. tried to cancel my order to buy a different size but was denied.
1,I can wear large BDU and ACU pants just fine. These I could not even button. I'm not paying a BS restocking fee either, so I gave them to a friend. Order LARGER than you expect. I want to say the seemed to be well made, but since I never got to wear the darn things I don't know...
1,Hated
1,Thin material.
1,Not very soft, I don't like to wear them.
1,The other reviewers were right about this bra's shape. It gives a slightly cone shape which looks slightly unnatural and feels awkward while wearing. As a result, I promptly returned.
1,The sizes run small
1,Very tight in waist and large in cup size.
1,I loved the color, the leather, the rear zip was awkward, and it was really sized too small
1,Don't buy  unless you are looking for a thin see thru polyester dress.  Wish I had returned in the return window.  It's too bad because the print was nice.
1,Didn't really fit. I would recommend  ordering one size up if on the heavy side
1,I ordered a size 18 month and it arrived marked as 24-28 lbs. My 5 month old grandson, who just returned from a doctor's visit weighed in at 18.3 lbs. He MIGHT have been able to wear these alleged 18 month size onsies when he was 3 months old. So be warned! If your baby is a newborn or an extremely early baby, by all means buy these as they are REALLY cute, but otherwise steer clear.
1,Just.no. It wasn't that it was too small or big, it just was weird shaped. Almost uneven. One breast higher than the other. I am a DD and knew I wasn't going to get support needed. A lot of room near underwire under my breasts, but no room up top. The only thing great were the straps, which were comfortable. Manufacturer has to work on the cups and band. The band is smaller than average U.S. measurement.	They got the straps right. It's possibly a bra for smaller busts, but idk. Just weird. Sticking to Wacoal and Vic Secret. Went a cheap route because it was pretty & reviews ok. Returned.
1,Very uncomfortable  . . .  ended up returning them for a credit.
1,Wayyy too thin like for a baby and didn't come with the certificate pictured as I thought it would. Also had to email them before I saw my refund over a week after sending it back.
1,I returned this; it is pretty slim fit, which made it not as flattering (clinged in the stomach) and the material was very thin.  There are at least two different dresses on this listing.  This is is the version WITHOUT ties on the shoulder, and it is much longer than the version with the ties on the shoulder.
1,It arrived whit the demaged zipper
1,1 star for color. I am fairly certain that the were mis-sized.  I have bought numerous pairs of same style and material and they have always fit. These I could not get on my foot.  I gave them away bc of high restocking and shipping fees.
1,It's a very clingy material so it's not right for my body type. I'm bummed that I missed the return deadline. Now, I'm stuck with it.
1,fine until washed, shrunk considerably despite being washed in cold water and hung to dry.
1,Material is pretty thin. I had myself measured a couple weeks ago and was a 46, I have other pants that are 46 x 32, but this one fits like a 48-50...
1,I WAS very excited to have this.  I travel to Europe a lot and felt safer knowing that I was going to have a safe wallet.  BOTH zippers, the main one as well as the change pocket, immediately broke.  When you are in a foreign country this is a disaster.  You need to protect your foreign money, a credit card as well as your passport.....a disaster when ALL the zippers immediately brake.
1,I really wanted to love these flats, and was so excited to receive them today.  Unfortunately, they will be going back.  It seems like they have some type of "fishing line" they use, to stitch the elastic around the top of the shoe.  I could feel cut ends of this "fishing line" jabbing into my feet, and it irritated me so much, I had to take them off and put them back in the box.
1,Not for the ladies that have a bigger chest. I didn't like the flow.
1,Costume was not as pictured, mask is very different than the one shown, to say the least my husband was disappointed when it arrived. It is also cut about two sizes too small, the pants were extremely tight on my husband, top wasn't too bad, but should of been a little bit bigger for the size. Material is thin and cheap which for the price is expected, but if you plan to make a few appearances in this, it may not last depending on how rough on it you are.
1,I bought an xl and I am usually a largestill way too small
1,I like how the front scoops down - there's plenty of space for the belly.  But the seams are falling apart on one of the pairs already.  I'm just going to  buy a larger underwear size from Victoria's Secret instead, given the price of these. Other than the seams falling apart, they are comfortable.
1,Pain! These shoes, or at least the pair I got are very narrow in the toe box width.  The length in the tie box seemed okay , but the part that should sit against the widest part of the foot was cutting in at a really weird place for me.		I own some other shoes from Dream Pairs of another style that are outstandingly comfortable for.being a tall heel. This style was so tight, there was no way I can wear them.		The color was lovely and the quality of this brand is nice. This style looks wonderful, but this pair was certainly no dream.
1,Overall the shirt and print look on point. My one star rating is because the print starts to peal after the first wash which is a huge disappointment.
1,Seem pretty cheaply made although very cute. My big toe broke through after 1 day of wearing. Not cool!
1,These are amazingly uncomfortable  Offhand, the comparison I can think of is this shoe feels like it was made with credit card plastic it is so stiff and unyielding.  It also felt almost a full size to small it is so tight.  Too bad, looks so cute.
1,My junk would not fit in the bottom part of the banana
1,Shirt doesn't look as pictured, I expected it to be a somewhat sheer, drapey, v-neck shirt in a dark heather gray color. The collar is round, the shirt is not sheer, it is a medium/light gray color, the sleeves are kind of short and structured looking.
1,Beware this pant runs about 2 sizes smaller than their other pant products.  Look to be a high quality pant, but since fit was so far off, I can't recommend them.
1,I love the color and the shape  but it one size to big I thing the sizes are  from china
1,Product felt cheap. Fabric is very see through and thin. Skirt was also on the small side.
1,Doesn't look ANYTHING like the picture! Runs small! The fabric is cheap, Halloween costume foam & it made me sneeze like twelve times when I took it out of the package. I've had Halloween costumes that were in better condition than this thing, actually. Super disappointed, brah!
1,Love the shoes, purchased first week of October. Noticed the first week of January the uppers are separating from the sole at the toe. Very expensive to only last a few months. I want a replacement!!!!
1,Not a fan of the either the sizing or the way this shirt feels.  It's quite boxy and the v-neck doesn't fall correctly.  I am usually happy with Cherokee but this style is not a winner in my opinion.
1,Stone fell out 1st time I wore it!!!!!!!  Buyer beware!!!!!!
1,The fabric is fine, but i think that runs a little large :/ I'm going to have to wait 4 or 6 months for my daughter to fit well.
1,Horrible
1,iT IS NOT WHITE AND HAS A BADLY MADE!  i WAS VERY DISAPOINTED.  hAS NOT CLASS AT ALL.  i COULD HAVE DID BETTER IN A "GOODWILL USED STORE CHEAPER.  NO SHAPE AT ALL.
1,Confusing.  Mens Converse size 8 were sent
1,Previous same order was perfect. This one left leg bigger then right leg. I am keeping it because you do not have others in Stock. I am paying for alterations since I had to have them shortened anyway, but trimming left leg is costing me  $28.00. You did not have my inseam size 28. Let me know when you have 52w28L because I would like to purchase more.
1,These have always been good pants for work.  This pair began coming apart at the seams on the rear pocket area just after the 30 day period.  It looks like this is something that should have been caught in QC and not made it out of the factory.  Now I can't return them because it has been 33 days.  I wore them 5-6 times.
1,Not good quality
1,It was supposed to be wife fit, it was not.
1,My foot wouldn't even go in because the shoe wasn't tall enough - hopefully that makes sense. My feet aren't that big either.	I usually love sketchers, but these had to be sent back.
1,I should have ordered 1 xl instead of large.
1,After a major surgery on my abdomen, I needed something for support until it heals and I get my core muscles back.  I guess you get what you pay for... one of the boning on the back popped out after wearing it for a few hours on the second day.  I sewed the edges to keep the boning in place. The picture makes it look like it's pretty wide, but that model must be a super small person.  I'm 5'3" tall and it's not wide enough for my short torso.  Read reviews and description before purchasing.  Be sure to get 2 sizes up.  I'm usually a size small, but the medium I purchased barely reached the velcro on the other side.  It overlapped just barely, leaving about 3 inches of velcro exposed and ruined my pants!
1,I have to say I am very disappointed, the dress took a long time to come from chine and what I received looks nothing like the picture. Or what the other customers pictures look like. The bow looks way different and ruins the dress, its sloppy and misshaped. The dress also has a weird mandarian collar which Im not really into either. I will not be keeping or wearing this.
1,My previous experience with Vionic shoes was that they were super comfortable. No blisters, no rubbing, no toe pain. This colorful Josie kitten heel looks very cute but thats about it. Its very very uncomfortable. There is no sign of a cushioned sole portion noticeable, the toe box is very uncomfortable and very narrow and shallow. The heel rubbed me sore after less than 3 minutes. I bought 2 pairs, 9.5 medium and 9.5 wide- the sizing is inconsistent- why is a wide shoe 0.75cm longer than a medium shoe?	The medium width felt like a narrow and is too tight while the wide is huge and slips of my feet.
1,I have several pairs of these in blue and they fit perfectly.  Why is the black pair waaaay too small?
1,Way too tiny
1,It did not fit my engagement ring properly and scratched up the bottom and sides of the band. It would move and slide then pop off.
1,Don't be fooled by what you have heard that they are back in style -- that may be...but they are still as easily stretched out and too-soon sloppy as they were in the 70's!!
1,Uncomfortable. Can't stand in them very long. They are not structured enough to run or even walk long distances in. Not ventilated well at all. Runs small.	Tried to wear them in a little, but still very stiff. The arch is not supportive at all and the heel cup is way too shallow.	If it wasn't for the reasonable price and style of this shoe, this review would most definitely only have one star.
1,Perhaps I have naturally large areola and nipples so these nipple covers did little to cover the entire area. And before I stepped out of the house, they are already falling off. Pretty useless, not adhesive at all if you guys have ever used those stick-on adhesive nubras, I repeat, these are a total waste of money.
1,They look really stupid on the foot.  They are big and lumpy. Comfortable yes, but I would only want to wear them around the house or somewhere no one can laugh.
1,Im a female with ordinary-sized wrists and the cuffs on these sleeves are almost cutting off circulation to my hands. Weird.
1,Not very comfortable and a dust and hair magnet...  Many pockets madness it great and practical. The zipper is good to have to keep from having to tuck shirt and undershirt after every time
1,This item did not fit like it should nor did it look like the picture. I emailed the company and they refunded my money.
1,sizes where wrong and mislabeled, very narrow, returned
1,when I got the earrings one of them had a dried, hard, white, thick, mystery substance all over the dangle part that's supposed to thread through your ear. I'm guessing it was dried glue that got where it shouldn't have been- either way extremely poorly made, didn't even put that mystery white substance anywhere near my ear lobes.
1,I don't know if the pants were mislabeled or if Columbia's quality has gone that far down the drain. maybe both! I ordered a size 42W x 34I "Silver Ridge convertible pants".  The waist fit was good, but the inseam (34" which is the longest inseam available) looked like I was wearing pants that Daisy Duke would wear.  I have purchased the same size Columbia Pants in the past, without a problem.  I have ordered another style to see if it was just a mistake.
1,First off, the shoes I received look like they had been worn a little bit.  There are little pieces of dirt on the bottoms of the shoes.  It looks like someone tried to clean them up but missed a few places. On the inside of the shoes there are lots a little white specs, like whoever wore them had on white socks.		Now to the actual shoe.  Over the years I have bought several pairs of New Balance shoes, most of them through Amazon.  Usually I am pleased with them.  This pair, not so much. The toes are very tight. (I bought a 7.5 wide, my usual size)  I bought these to wear to work but because they are so snug, I'm not sure if I will be able to.  Kind of disappointed because I need new work shoes.
1,The fabric and fit of the pants were lovely, but were simply too long.  My husband will not wear pants that do not drape his shoe to his satisfaction and these seemed to be almost an inch too long.
1,These are very thin but also very soft. Much more like pajamas than bike shorts.	Amazon forces you to state how these fit when you review a product, but I don't actually know because I bought them as a donation.
1,Was very much disappointed with the shoes. In the photo it shoes them with no strap and that is what I was wanting. When I received them they had a strap on the heel. Sent them back for refund.
1,way too small.......ended up ordering two sizes up.....
1,i don't know why i bother trying to order one size items, always disappointing.  i had a pair of suspender nylons and loved them and wanted another pair, but these fit terrible, so not flattering.
1,I found the shirts tight and odd. Would never wear. They are at the bottom of my closet.
1,DO NOT buy Nordvek slippers -- if they don't fit, you;ll have to return them at your own expense.
1,This scrub pants elastic at the waist was too small for whatever reason. I had to return them. :(
1,These shoes are way too small and there is a sharp piece of plastic that sticks out by the pinky toe. Do not recommend anyone purchasing.
1,I ordered a size nine and it came in men's size nine. I should I have ordered a size seven. Also I should have paid more attention to how they come. So I am sending back and going to get a better fit.
1,My daughter is 4.5 YO (has average size head) and we barely managed to fit this wig. My daughter has very smooth hair so it was fairly easy to get tucked under the wig; I can't imagine what a child with curly or slightly less manageable hair would do. The underlying mesh is too small and wouldn't stay on her head. I had to work very hard to prevent it from falling off every 5 seconds. In addition, the hair is much shorter that pictured so the final result looks not quite the same. While I didn't expect this to be a professional high class product for the price, I would still like for it to be of higher quality. Wouldn't buy it again.
1,themanufacturer should warn potential customers that this product is NOT sized in a standard manner.
1,Felt flimsy.  Would not stand up to the amount of walking I do.  Had to return.
1,I was told that by other reviewers to order a size up, well I did but when I received my boot I realized that the knitting inside and around the boots stretches, the boot at first may fit tight but after a few wears the knitting will stretch  and the boot will fit as expected but since I ordered a size bigger then what I really wear these boots were HUGE on me so I had to return them. After returning they were out of stock so I was unable to get a replacement and I didn't even get to enjoy the boots I ordered. I do wish however that the customer service could have sent me a pair when they did come back in stock but they told me no they couldn't do it so I missed out on these boots. If you are buying keep in mind
1,IN one wash, this skirt became unwearable. I should have just returned it for a refund. Instead it's in the Goodwill pile.
1,The texture does not feel like linen and cotton. The length is 10 cms shorter! Definitely it doesnt look like on the pictures.	The fabric is stiff like a tablecloth.and color is blue but not nice blue.
1,This was a very thin material and the sweater was very wiiiiide.
1,Had more arch support then the Merrell's, but that's not saying much.  Were just uncomfortable to me.  Price was good but not worth the discomfort trying to walk in them even if just around the house.  Am returning.
1,This robe should not cost more than $40, it looks cool, just as pictured but i don't think it will last long. one size does not fit all, i'm 6 ft 225lbs and it was snug and shed an awful lot just from trying it on. it would be good for a costume.
1,Go a size up..
1,Gave these a shot, looking for a pair of solid boot cut jeans.  I received them in a timely fashion, but they looked straight-legged.  So I meaasured the thigh, knee and opening..ALL 3 came to 9".		If you are looking for a boot cut DO NOT purchase these.  Ive already given them to Goodwill!
1,The first pair of these I got looked like they had been worn, the second pairs looked even worse! I thought bought of them were a ran a bit bigger(in length) than needed and very narrow. The sandal over all seems to be a good idea for hiking in wet areas(and for narrow feet). If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy at all.
1,WAY too narrow in the toe even though I ordered a wide. Had to return for a different pair from the same brand. These are very stiff, not comfortable.
1,the dress isn't a halter top tie like pictured. the belt i received in NOTHING like the picture what i recieved is a  a cheesy gold plastic with a broken chain
1,I used this ONE time, and after unzipping it about 5 or 6 times that day, the zipper seperated. Now it's usless. I had read this was a problem, so I didn't use the zipper until the day I needed it. Pretty expensive for a one time use. It's really cute and functional but kind of cheap in materials.
1,Too large and too heavy for a hospital stay...I had to return it.
1,No me han llegado
1,These don't fit as well as some of the other styles the company has. I still prefer Calvin Klein and new balance boxer briefs over under armour
1,OKAY
1,Was not cut like the other cap.
1,I bought my size, and the cups were far too small. Even on the model you can see that the top of the cup is cutting into her a little. Not to mention, these cups are not shaped at all and the material is incredibly thin
1,The panties fit better than expected... the problem came in as the colors in the package looked so different fand darker from what I thought I ordered.  The online photo is blurry and does not show patterns or true color.... thought I was getting solid colored pastels
1,Too small, to tight,
1,The zipper was broken right out of the bag.  It was stuck at the top.  I couldn't even try it on.  I am not going to ask for a replacement because it felt like it would be very clingy.  The material was stretchy.  Not at all what I was expecting.
1,Loved this badge reel but the string broke easily and the jewels came off quickly.
1,poor quality
1,They are sized too big! I do not like them
1,To large to the size
1,Make sure you scroll way down on the size list to pick the correct size or else you'll be sorry.
1,What a POS. This is not a name brand Komene waist trainer. This is flimsy, thin and very poorly made. I have a Komene trainer in black and white leopard print. I was needing a smaller size so I ordered this thinking it was the same brand and quality but wouldn't show the print through my clothes only to be extremely disappointed. This is going back.
1,I actually loved the bra, the colors, etc. Unfortunately, one of the straps was sewn incorrectly, so that it was always twisted. For the price, I am not the best seamstress and would not attempt to cut the seam and reattach it myself. I returned the item.
1,Prior to purchasing any Mommylicious Maternity items I would strongly encourage anyone to google search their company and read more about how incredibly horrendous their customer service is.
1,I buy Haggar products of the rack, but I was very disappointed in these. they came out of the dryer with no crease, and definately needed an ironing.
1,This is tiny. It looks like a kids suitcase that can hold a couple of teddy bears.	I can't believe this is sold as a carry on. I bought for a friend for his birthday and I am extremely embarrassed
1,Very stiff sole wore less then 5 minuites almost tripped twice. Band is way to big for shoe size so keep wanting to fall off unless you have fat feet. Return was easy so....
1,I need a work shoe really bad and this looks similar to my current Naturalizer work shoes so I gave it a try.  I was really disappointed.  The shoe was too short, the material it is made of was very hard and not very giving, and it looked cheap.
1,I don't like this product. Isnt soft and smell very bad
1,A little too loose for my liking. Less like a jegging and more like a jean. Not what I hoped for. Keeping them anyway...,
1,No good
1,Ripped after the first wash.
1,Usually swiss guard provides a tough product but the button fell off. Other than that it has been good.
1,This hat is probably sized for a teenager. VERY small. I'm a petite person and it still didn't fit. The fibers also made me a little itchy, too. All over, not a great deal.
1,My son and wife got these for Christmas and they loved them.
1,Liked the overall style. I just couldn't find a size to fit. Ended up settling on bigger rather than too small. It ended up being a dust collector.
1,Wish they fit. Won't be worth it to send back.
1,Super heavy and uncomfortable. Sizing was messed up, and the rubber for the toe piece got bent in the mailing bag that amazon uses to ship causing further discomfort. Smells. Could use a little more design and color work.
1,Cheap replica.
1,This was not what i expected.  The hat itself is very shallow if that makes sense. I have what i think is a relatively small and round head and this hat covers only the top half. Forget this hat if you have a lot of hair. The brim is also excessively long.
1,I bought these three dots as they were described as stones. I could not hope to carry any of the 3 dots along in my pocket because they'd be lost. For what this is I paid a very high price and since the dots are about the size of the tiny print on the very small card then I would have to say buyer beware. When size is not listed they do that for a reason and I found out the hard way.
1,TOTAL CRAP DO NOT BUY. SERIOUSLY!!!! the image is all disorted and the material is see through garbage. Seriously looks like they downloaded an image, blew it up and then ironed it on. Looks like a toddler made this during arts and crafts. DO NOT BUY.
1,I don't know why Greys went through with manufacturing this color pant but what makes me even angrier is the picture they use to advertise the lemonade color. On the model there is NO indication that this color is see through. One glance at the pictures I've included are enough to show that it's completely see through and nothing like the model. You couldn't wear these to work or school so there's literally no point in manufacturing colors that are sheer like this!
1,Thought I'd surprise my lady but when she	opened it I got surprised. She was not very happy.	Asked me if I thought her butt was that big.
1,A gem fell out after 3 days!
1,I am having to return both pairs of shoes because they are both large. I am disappointed since they were for vacation.
1,i ordered the matte black case, but i recieved the silver! oh well. don't feel returning it. it definitely has a practical look--very minimalistic. have no idea what the dial thing is on the top it moves counter clockwise and does absolutely nothing? anyway, if u want a simple analog watch then look no further. i bought this for work as an everyday watch as i was tired of rocking my pathfinder (casio). anyway, tx to the seller for playing the old switharoo with me, its been real....oh yeah another note, i didn't realize how much of an annoyance the pin placement would be. i rock my watch on my left hand and its a nuisance to adjust the watch with the pin being off centered, and on the wrong side. more fashion than function? ugh...i had this at 3 now its on a two star level...sorry.
1,I ordered this three sizes larger than normally wear. 22/24, it might fit my 14 year old  who normaly wears a juniors small.
1,says one size fits all but runs small
1,Purchased this for my adult son, who likes Captain America tees. He wears a 2x maximum in all vendors. We waited for weeks for delivery only to receive a shirt so snug he said he would not ever put it on again. Unfortunately, it is not worth the price of sending it back, so it will be donated. PS- the quality of the graphic on the nylon is less than impressive. He has tees with better graphic quality. I do not recommend this for anyone.
1,This is a very oddly fitted onesie, I'm 5'4 and purchased the large based on reviews	It barely hit my ankle yet the crotch was about mid-calf on me and extremely wide (I could probably fit 2-3 people easily in my onesie)	With the crotch being so low and having such large gaps between the button I basically had a 4-5 inch opening right where my underwear was every time I walked	I bent over and the buttons on the back flap all popped open	The tail and head are just as pictured and are REALLY cute	But the fabric was too cheap, too many loose easily poppable button gaps that I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this and you definitely could not sit for a long time without being uncomfortable because of the stuffed tail, looks cute in theory but was not designed well	BACK IT GOES!
1,I ordered 5 adult gowns and instead received 4 adult gowns and one child gown.
1,I bought this to wear to a fundraiser but I had to send it back. It did not fit true to size - I even ordered up a size and it was still too small. The material is not anything fancy which I didn't expect anyway for the price BUT the surging on the seams was awful!
1,Too big for what I need.
1,This shoe is not leather.  It is similar to a fabric boating slipper or a ballet slip on.  It is not worth the money and not like other shoes made by Arcopedico.  I returned the item the day after I received it and was charged a $10 penalty because I mailed it back in the Original Box.  I paid for shipping twice, plus a $10 fee and that money could have been spent on flip flops which would have been a better choice in comparison to this shoe and customer service from Roxy Shoes.
1,Ordered large , the large arrived looking like 3XL !!! Huge and long , like for big and tall ! Material very thin and see-through !
1,I wanted to like this but after 6 months, as I head back to work and face down the need to pump more often, I'm looking for a new pumping bra.		The size is adjusted with Velcro on the back. It's a pain to adjust by yourself. I needed my husband to help so it didn't take so long. I never did manage to position everything so that the Velcro didn't scratch my back (the back of the bra is taller than the underneath piece so you feel the Velcro at the top and bottom of the bra when you wear it).		I dealt with the scratchy Velcro but after weeks of using a binder clip to keep the zipper from unzipping while I pump, I'm throwing in the towel on this.		The pros: once you size it and rig the zipper, the flanges don't move (even with a baby grabbing at them), you can wear it strapless (I just put it on over my nursing tank without the straps which is nice in the winter because I can leave on my hoodie).
1,loved this shoe but had to return. shoe ran  half size small. no room for my toe  the heel was nice height was great.
1,I wanted to see reason why this product had such great reviews, so I bought it. I thought "why not it's only a penny". Well, you get your money's worth. These are horrible earrings. They quickly lose their luster and metallic color after just one use. This is extremely low quality! The back has rough edges and the zirconia's don't shine. However, I did find out why it had great reviews. The item is sent with an offer for a free pendant if you give this item a great review. I always look for bargains, but I am not going to write a fake review just so that I can get another cheap item. I give these earrings a one star. I would give them less if I could! By the way, you will end up spending around $7 (shipping) for something that is only worth a penny.
1,It is a stupid thing to sell a shoe that in my case is a size 7-8.  Which is it, do you wear a size 7 or 8?  In my case I wear a 7 so this size 7-8 is too big.  I won't fall for that again. Do yourself a favor and by a shoe in YOUR size not a range of sizes, it doesn't work.
1,Very poor quality and is orange,not coral.
1,Returned. didn't like fit.
1,I purchased this bathrobe for my fianc & was fairly disappointed. It is a very cheap material & fell apart after the first wash. It tore in both the arm pits within a month of purchasing it, so I then had to buy another rob of much better quality.
1,Pants are much bigger than the same size purchased at local store
1,Ordered a small and got a large instead.	However the shirt is of great quality. Just way too big for my son as the size shipped was wrong.
1,Boxers are cut vary low in the back, they are nice but not for every day use. would not buy again
1,Not as Warm as they advertise.  Can not wear in a cold Vermont weather and I wouldn't even wear them near or under 32 degrees.
1,Sent these back the fit seemed small and the sandal was just plain uncomfortable. Some people said you need a period to break them in but let's be honest ain't nobody got time fo dat! I just want a shoe that is comfy when I buy it and when it is broken in as well. Why buy something that doesn't work right away especially when there are so many comfy sandals out there? Get the old school tevas or another brand of sandal if you can.......
1,Stretched out after washing and had a hold in it.
1,My backpack fell apart into places. A zipper broke and the snap broke. There's so many zippers and snaps on this bag. But it is super cute and sturdy, and I wouldn't be giving it a low review if it hadn't broken right away
1,I really love the bulleted Vince Cumuto boot that looks similar to this style. That being said if you know the VC brand the quality is quite nice and detailing is superb. I didn't want to pay the sale price of $175 for the VC boots. I found these as an alternatIve and was excited. Another reviewer mentioned her 20 something daughter loved them and a 16 year sophmore did as old as well.  Well that makes more sense to me now, The quality of these matches that age group. No offense to that age group but as you get older you recognize quality. The styling is good but I've seen similar quality boots for half the price at forever 21. I'm not that old...lol... I'm in my early 30's and love high fashion items to give you perspective, but these were just cheap baggy junk for $70 bucks. I'm 5'3" and they hit right at my knee. I thought they would cover my knee cap at least (I wanted over the knee) but they didn't. If these were about $35 I would have considered keeping them but I like nicer quality looking things and I've had good luck finding that before at discounts and in synthetic material boots. Not worth it at all...wait until they are priced at around 30-35 at most b/c if you pay more than that you are getting ripped off.
1,There size char for Muisol brand is way off. The dress in Large was too tight, and not as pretty as the photo.	I returned the item.	In fact I returned 3 items from this brand. They run small and are cut wrong.
1,size is very small and short.
1,My first and last time buying shoes from off the internet. Although the shoes were more beautiful in person they did not even come close to fitting. After checking the sizing charts I guess they were not too accurate.
1,the fabric is "snaggy" and not a comfortable wear.
1,Very badly designed zippers. a serious headache to close this bag especially around the corners. Im a long time Delsey buyer, but they have now lost me with this utterly bad zipper design. I bought three of those !!
1,I have 2 Hayden straight legs which I love. According to comments from NYDJ employees the Marilyn is only different in decorative details, e.g. the Hayden has double belt-loops and stitching on the back pocket. Even the NYDJ web-site shows the rise and leg opening etc should be the same. However, this Marilyn feels tighter, and the rise seems shorter, thus causing the dreaded muffin top and just being uncomfortable to wear all day. this is even though I didn't buy a size down, which is what they recommend. Very disappointed!		Also: It's frustrating how inconsistent materials are at NYDJ. they used to be all 97-99% cotton. Now you have to look at each one to check if they are a cotton-poly blend or not. Also, some are "proudly made in USA", others are made in China (if they are so proud to make them in the USA, then why move production to China???)
1,I loved the look of this belt in pics but it is quite narrow! Like 1.5-2in maybe. So it would fit slacks. But who would wear a belt like this with slacks... O_o
1,I really loved this till it broke 2 weeks later. :-(  it fell when I was home. I do wear it everyday and don't take it off at night but that's what I do with the rest of my necklaces. This is my newest necklace and it's the first to break. You can't fix it yourself as the chain is too tiny. I'll have to go to a shop but idk if its worth doing that. It looks really cute but cheaply made.
1,Comfortable fit.  Only complaint is that the edges tend to curl when removed from the dryer.  I never dry above "Low", so this is an issue for me because I don't want to have to Iron these types of shirts.
1,I have a number of Crocs sandals, slides & mules in various styles & colors. I ordered my trusty 8 in Women's in the pink cobbler. Unfortunately, the sizing is just a bit off. Although the length is correct, my big toe is not entirely on the shoe bed. This has not happened to me in any other Crocs style, and the shoe would be too long one size up.		Love the style of this sandal but unfortunately it had to go back.
1,I ordered petite length but these are still dragging on the ground. I almost tripped because of them. Even after washing them. Also, I wore them one and there are areas that are pilled already.
1,These shoes HURT!!! Only reason why Im keeping them is because my husband likes them on me. Other then that they wldve been back in that box on its way to amazon!!
1,These are really cool converse, I've been wearing converse for years and years now and these are just as I'd expect. The black and gum ones have a little bit of black leather on the heel and tongue, which was nice and unexpected.		UPDATE: well I'm only one month in and these converse have already got a huge problem, the sole is already coming unglued from the trim rubber on one side of one of these shoes. This is something I'd expect after a year or so of hard use. I'm extremely unsatisfied with this product as it currently is completely defective.		A pair of converse should not fail in just a month of normal use.
1,This bra must be a cup size smaller than advertised. I am a 34B, and tried this bra in the nude and black. and neither fit properly. The quality of the bra is okay for the price point, but for a little extra, I would rather get a higher quality product. Both of my bras were returned.
1,Are these fake CK jeans? Bought many CK jeans before mostly from retail stores, none of them have dye problem, but this one does. Washed it and dried, all my other clothes were dyed blue in washing machine. Buyers be aware.
1,Have to send back, just too tight for my comfort level. Nice otherwise! Good quality.
1,Toys should be able to be played with...my eight year old boy dropped it on the kitchen floor and it was over :( Disappointed boy and wasted money.
1,In the crotch area the string stared to fall out and I didn't think anything of it and then when I threw a football and then they ripped
1,I have used Playtex 18 hour for many years and now that they no longer make the kind I've used, I thought I'd try this style as well as another. This one does not fit properly, (while the other does just like my old bras). I wear a 42C and this fits like a 40B. I'm disappointed and will be returning it.
1,The shoe itself is very comfortable and stylish.  Unfortunately after receiving them for Christmas they are already coming apart on the bottom of one of the shoes where the rubber along the side meets the sole.  I don't even wear these every day.  That's completely unacceptable for any shoe.  Definitely returning these.
1,I used to order a couple of pairs of Rykas every year.  They were great quality, fit well, comfortable and lasted.  However, the last few pair of Rykas that I have ordered are none of those things.  They are made cheap.  The fit is way off.  Not comfortable.  I don't know how long they will last as I have sent the last 3 pair back.  I think all this has become a problem because of all the "out-sorcing".  No more Rykas for me.  I just hate it when companies ruin a perfectly good product and think they can get by with it!
1,For the price, I felt the leather seemed of not good quality and the support wasn't great. For the price, it felt and looked more like a non leather boot for $70
1,The shoe arrived with the flower being dirty- not recommended
1,the fit is awful (not properly made), length is wrong and x-small fit like large. i would not recommend this item to anyone.
1,On the product page it says in one place that these fit size 6-10 and in another it says they fit size 6-9. In either case, they should have fit my size 8.5 foot. I assure you my shoe size really is 8.5; it's not secretly 11 and I just say it's smaller! When I hold up a ruler to the bottom of my foot it measures 9.5" end-to-end if that's helpful to anyone. The heel on the sock is nowhere near my actual heel so the sock sits even lower than it would on a foot it fit, meaning that on me it's barely an anklet. I don't need ANKLETS for winter, I need proper socks. They *are* soft and very cute, enough so that my sister with a size 6 shoe size wanted them, saving me a return.		I wouldn't have purchased but for the assurance on the product page that these "socks come is a standard US SIZE that fit shoe sizes from US 6 - 10, so everyone can enjoy these colorful, Winter socks."
1,I was very pleased with the dress until I noticed a giant coffee stain on it before it had been worn. Wondering how it would be sold like that. Very disappointed.
1,I'm 5'4" and post baby about 140lbs. I hated how this fit me. Looked like I was wearing a tent. Sleeves were tight. Great color, however.
1,Bought this for my daughter a year ago.  The zipper broke after 3 uses and I just threw it in the garbage.  We took it on 3 vacations and she used it for sleeping over her grand parents house on the weekends.  Super cute, not made well.
1,Arrived broken.
1,This watch arrived with the crown falling out of it and lost crystals.	I also went to a local watch maintainer, he confirmed it is a very cheap watch using low rated Chinese mechanism.
1,I would have given 1 star, but there are 2 that are pretty.  Most would have been, had they not been crushed, broken, cleaned properly, been tumbled and treated correctly.		  I ordered these with high hopes and boy, are they dashed.  First, they came in a	plain plastic bag and mailed with no further protection in a bubble envelope.		Which, no surprise, led to more damage on already poorly handled crappy selection of badly tumbled rocks. I went through them and found rust stains, basically crushed crystals and some very small stones. Even worse, I was shorted 2 rocks, because there are only 23 NOT  the advertised 25!!!!		Absolutely no guide to help, but I know I got 2 small stained and crushed amethyst, 1 dalmation jasper, 1 tiny rose quartz, a broken piece of lapis and several clear quartz, in addition to the unidentified ones. What a rip-off.		I am going to likely return these.  Other places I have found way better selection, much more rocks for my mone
1,Terrible, don't buy it unless you are very small.
1,Arrived with a huge hole along the seam on the right side. Disappointed
1,very tight around wast. Fabric rolls down if you sit and digs into your sides
1,Please don't buy these!! Are they beautiful? OF COURSE	Do they fit properly? Yes, they actually do!	Do they last? Not even for a minute.		I can't even imagine what these beautiful shoes would look like if my daughter wore them once. The second I lifted them from the package, all those beautiful little gemstones fell off the shoes like sand. I couldn't believe it! And these aren't like $2 Walmart clearance shoes that you'd expect that to happen to. I returned them immediately and went with another pair without the sparkles. I thought these would be a nice sparkly shoe without the hassle of glitter, but these fell off... like glitter. No bueno.
1,Did not like quality.
1,Tried to return but I was outside of the return window but I had bought them for summer vacation and didn't know that they would be an entire size too big.  I was really really dissapointed and I will not be purchasing through this vendor again.
1,Very disappointed with these.  They are short --  too short for the average adult shoe --  and at least half the length of the lock laces brand.  I promptly removed these from my shoes (which I really could not wear because these were too short and tight) and put in lock laces.  Unless you are looking to put these in a child's shoes, don't bother to buy.
1,I am trying to return. Very, very dissatisfied with this product. Did not widen the shoe at all.
1,Does not look like the picture! Was more like a crop top!
1,I guess you get what you pay for. This is so tiny . Not really long enough it. My fault for not researching more.
1,I was expecting a larger scraf! It fits too small for me.
1,I need to return these.  They are very painful
1,It doesn't the same color it look like a sad color and cheaper
1,Runs SUPER small
1,The construction was so poor. When i opened the package the buttons already had come off.
1,These are nice looking flip flops and comfortable at first.  Then they got stretched and I can't wear them after 1 month.
1,i got this product today; some of the pearls color are dull & pealed off... and set is sticky as if it is used one.. Though the ear studs are pretty; by reading above comment, i feel like pearls can fall of anytime. have return this set..
1,These shoes are VERY cheap. They are extremely uncomfortable & very hard. After wearing them for two days the bamboo material started peeling off & messing up. After wearing them for a week the strap broke completely off. I was shopping while it happened, so I had to leave bc my shoes were broke. Don't waste your money on these shoes!
1,I was looking for a retro looking pair polarized sunglasses, and of course, I was pretty happy to find this. Ordering and shipment was smooth since it was FBA, but when I has actually arrived, I found them to be just normal lens, not polarized. Ugh, what a waste of my time and money. The sunglasses are not bad looking, it's nice to come with a protective pouch. However, the quality is just so-so, I would compare it to the cheap sunglasses at Target or Walmart. I am going to return this.
1,this shoe was so small I thought they sent me a childrens size....No bueno - it did look kinda cute...but all I can say is worry about the sizing...Goodness!
1,Looked okay for about 20 minutes, but then it just seemed to look super frizzy and terrible.
1,I'm normally a medium ordered a large because of the reviews and still too small
1,Way too large!
1,This was not a flattering bra on a 36GG build.  I tried it on the moment I got it home and was very disappointed.
1,Bought this in January for my son to use for this year of school we are only in 2months of school and it's ripping and is useless and now I have to replace it.... don't buy this!!!!
1,These sneakers are too low in the heel and my foot comes in and out of them.  They are lightweight, which I like in a sneaker.  However, they just don't fit my feet correctly.  They might be fine for some people so you might want to give them a try.  They just didn't work for me.
1,Don't waste your money. The shoe always opened and was very easy for my baby to take off on any occasion she could lol
1,The title say Aqua, it is not Aqua its green.  That would be ok, but it also doesn't glow in the dark.  It was cheap so it'll get worn as the costume jewelry it is.
1,Advertised unavailable product.
1,The product got one star because is was a complete FAKE! Not even close to the real product listed. I own several REAL Fox shirts and those one will get 5 Stars!
1,Mask did not come as indicated  in description  and on package
1,they are ok
1,Gonna have to return, these run about 2 sizes too large.
1,Our order for basic Reef Men's Sandal was never fulfilled. We never received a status update, even after requesting one. This is NOT a reliable and professional seller/vendor.
1,Not satisfied. Various issues with items, Incorrect items sent (Sent Womens Small when ordered Mens XXL, and part of what was sent is too small.
1,Go with the doublju hoodie dress.that hits mid thigh.im 5"9 and 135lbs. Great fit and true to size. This is just a shirt.not even that cute.dont bother.item is not as pictured,way ,way,shorter.out and out false advertising.also,has no stretch.  Update: company contacted me,asked me to delete my reveiw for a fifty percent refund.ha ha.no way.this os a shirt.even if u are five f tall,its a shirt,not even that cute.makes me look frumpy..btw,im five nine 36-24-37,makes me look like i hav no waist,bad cut.mde in china for sure
1,Very disappointed with the colors that are sent. I've ordered four different times hoping to get the advertised colors and always got pastel. I also changied sizes because I think that they run a little large. The quality seemed fine but I returned most of them.
1,I bought this shirt with the silly idea that it would be heavy weight fabric. It is thin as newspaper. Fits nicely and is comfy, but THIN fabric. Too much trouble to return it. Also, my bad, but I didn't check to see if it was tagless, so had to cut nasty tag from neck hole. Most recently, after 3 washes, I find the hem around bottom coming unsewn, allowing hem to unfold. This is a cheaply made piece of junk. Highly recommend anyone to NOT BUY this shirt..
1,Unfortunately, it's way too wide so my foot slides around in the show all the time. I'm going to try a narrow style or  different style Birkenstock next time.
1,In regards to size, they are little bit longer then I need but Im on the shorter side, 52. I gave the product only two stars because of the quality. I can get better ones for less at a local grocery store chain. I would purchase the product again. They were not what I expected for the price.
1,Small
1,The show is not flexible at all the heel is loose and slips. It eats your socks.
1,I really was not a fan of the color either. Bright white reminded me of elementary days shoes. Not really adult like.
1,Light colored different than picture and they are very large too big will be returning them
1,I ordered two rings at two different times acknowledging that on the first ring I ordered the wrong size. On the second order I measured my finger with s string and compared my old ring to the measurement to determine that size. After receiving the second ring it's too big. The Chinese must have a different way of measuring things or the ring was mislabeled. The detail of the ring is nice otherwise I would not have order a second time. I'm uncertain if it's worth sending the rings back to China and paid the postage. Two start for size, three for the quality.
1,Ripped apart in less than four months. Very cheaply made. Was slightly big but manageable for 3 foot 2 inch toddler.
1,You get what you pay for. The balls are literally plastic, with glitters inside it. I was hoping for the balls to be a bit big, but it was way too small. The metal spiral was indeed too big, and so did not stay in place and looked more cheap.		You rather spend your $7 on etsy then buy this for $7 here, and at least get a less cheaper looking design worth wearing.
1,they are smaller then i expected, about the size of a nickel around. they are very soft. when i opened for the first time one of the earrings was not round like the other. it was easily put back into place though...but all this means is they are soft. i wouldn't buy again as i don't think they'll last long. they look nice on though and match my rose-gold watch and necklace.
1,Very displeased with these shoes. I put them on for the first time and the brown sole insert by the toes started to rip off almost immediately. The shoes smell like pure gasoline when taken out of the box and the smell doesn't go away for about a month. I got awful blisters on the pads of my feet and cuts on the backs of my heels from where the zipper digs into my heel, and that happened only about 10 minutes into wearing them. Seriously, 10 minutes and my heels were literally bleeding. So I had to walk around my friend's wedding barefoot in the heat, outside because these shoes were so bad. Do not buy these shoes, it's always worth it to buy higher quality for more money, than to buy cheap.
1,Update: I have used these for hiking for months and now I have seriously damaged achilles tendons and feet that require physical therapy, ruining my ability to do physical activity without pain.  These shoes are the only things that have changed in that period.  I am throwing these away and would not recommend them to anyone.		These are very comfortable to walk around on trails, but they are not good running shoes.  Also, high socks are needed, otherwise the shoes give you blisters in the heel.  Recommended if you want something comfy to walk in.  If you want to run, just know that they provide no stability or arch support and you can feel the rocks through the bottom of the shoes.
1,This T Shirt shrunk about 2 sizes. I do not recommend this product. I bought two, gave them to my wife.
1,Unfortunately I will need to return because they are not true to size I need a full size smaller
1,The pants say that they were size 32x29 but NO way my husband uses size 32 for the past 40 years. This pants were extremely small
1,The shoes were my correct size but they are to lose for water aerobics.  I wore them once and the insole was coming a loose. I m returning them for a refund.  Not very cute
1,Compared with all the Crocs  own, this clog is just awful. The plastic is too HARD. They are not comfortable as other crocs and also come a bit larger.
1,Not thrilled with this shirt at all.  I bought a white, small (5'5", 130# and curvy).  First, it's completely see-through and extremely thin.  Looking at the pictures again, it's deceiving - her arms hide the middle section.  It's very loose around the middle yet fitted on my thighs, which is not flattering at all in my opinion.  It's very soft.  I'm considering keeping it solely as a layering or around-the-house shirt since it's only $9, but it's definitely not the staple white t-shirt I had hoped for.
1,I purchased the same Toms model for me and my wife. I ordered it from two vendors. Mine was exactly as expected in Toms box with all things inside (tags, bag, etc.) Unfortunately when this item came I was very disappointed. It came in generic brown box, no tags or Toms bag inside. On top of that under sole pattern looks  completely different from mine as well as material inside of the shoe. Bottom like looks fake and nothing more
1,Not what I wanted. I'm a 36DD so when I buy a sports bra I look for major support and this one doesn't provide that at all. It just lays there. And the padding in it moves around everywhere. I went for a hike and half way I realized the padding had gone to the middle!! Had to stick my hand in there to fix it  The only reason I gave 2 start because the bra did fit
1,not real happy  with it
1,Terrible, terrible  wig.	Scratchy, itchy, shedding en masse..	and of course it looks nothing like the photo.	I thought all cheap wigs must be like that until I received couple of days later a wig even cheaper (15 dollars) which was well made, looked like real hair and was elegant and sexy.	It made me realize that even among the costume-priced dos there are pearls and turds.	this one is a turd.	I returned for a refund.
1,to small
1,The fit is ok, but a bit small. But the material is too thin...closer to panty-hose than men's socks.
1,Last  time buy shirts on line, fit smaller than the size requested.
1,These were way too big. Im 5'6, 120. I bought a size 4. These are not skinny jeans. They are 'mom jeans' and run very large. Not as they looked in picture, not cute. Believe me, if you are looking for skinny, fitted jeans-- these are not them.
1,These were WAY too big. I couldn't wear them.
1,The length is ridiculously short!!! It comes to my knees and the material feels cheap. I'd love to get my money back. False advertisement, looks nothing like the picture other than the color.
1,I don't know what I was expecting...but this wasn't it.  As it is summer, and I hate bras and sweating, I decided to order a size larger than I normally wear.  Good thing I did as the band feels really snug.  I was excited at the prospect of having a bra that offered good support with no underwires.  True: it does support (like a sports bra) and there aren't any underwires.  The trade off?  I have pointy breasts like Madonna.
1,Ripped within weeks
1,The tee is too thin, it looks transparent i thinks is fake
1,I've had these for about a year & have never worn them.  They are bigger than I had expected & they color is really ugly.
1,Fits fine. Not as high-waisted as I expected, but it fits okay.
1,Bought 4 of the popular "pouch" style underwear brand's similar product and these were one of them.	Overall the quality seemed nice but there is no legit "pouch" or extra fabric to separate... it was just like extra amount of fabric on the front for your twig and berries to push into instead of a legit pouch where your guys are separated in their own space.
1,Way too small.
1,Cheap quality
1,Runs way too small. not great quality
1,I did not read the measurements for the size chart before they were ordered. I received the one for my fianc to wear to our wedding. He wears an XL is just about everything. He could only button the top button on the vest. I am having to order a different one. We went this this one because it had the colors for the groom and groomsmen that would match the younger boys ones. Make sure to measure before purchasing. The product was received very quickly and appears to be a good item, just won't fit.
1,I love Sanuk shoes so much! I own 4 pairs of Yoga Slings and two pairs of Sidewalk Surfers. I can't say enough good things about Sanuk products. But I have to give this design only 2 stars. The straps do no stay up around my foot. I've tried adjusting the straps to make them tighter but that just forces my foot closer to the toe of the shoe and the straps around my ankle still fall down. I can't walk very far or fast in these. They are still comfy over all but having to stop often to readjust the straps ins't my idea of a good design. They are ok for wearing to the office when I know I won't have to be walking around much. If you are on trying to decide between these and the Yoga Sling design, I 100% recommend going with the Yoga Sling. They are the most comfortable sandals I've ever owned. I spent 3 days walking around Disneyland in the Sanuk Yoga Slings.
1,I don't know anyone small enough to fit into these pants at sized small, I'm 110 # and no way they could fit. thank god for free returns,I don't have the time nor desire to play the size game. Loved the color and the material was nice, too bad though. Moving on,.....	<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/YourStyle-Stretchy-Slim-Fit-Skinny-Long-Jegging-Pants-Small-Teal/dp/B01IFQRWX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">YourStyle Stretchy Slim Fit Skinny Long Jegging Pants (Small, Teal)</a>
1,These are the cheapest most disgusting leggings I have ever ordered in my life.  They are made with the worst quality material, look nothing like the picture and took forever to get.  DO NOT PURCHASE THESE.  I tried returning them and still have not heard back from the seller.
1,nice color and style, but material is thin cheap t shirt looking. haven't worn but suspect the material won't do too well in wash. Will hand wash. too much effort for a cheap dress. don't recommend.
1,I usually wear a size 7.  I read they ran small so I ordered a size 6 1/2.  They were still big and also very wide.  I returned them and order a size 6 (because I loved the gold stripe in these shoes).  The size 6 was too small.  I returned them.  I would not recommend these shoes.  They are wide and short.
1,I recieved ring yesterday. It's definately not what I expected. I thought the ring would be alittle bigger but it's not. It's thin, stones are tiny, not as green as I'd thought it'd be. Overall style is cute tho. For me, looks like I'm trying to dress my bloated finger w a skimpy ring. Sizing is correct. Cute, but giving away; my niece will like it. For the price, one shouldn't have high expectations. Personally, I'm not recommending.
1,Too narrow and very snug for a Wide width size 10.  Sneaker could have been a winner with its plush, cushiony insole, but it fit like a stretchy rubber glove.
1,Size is too sure, big 2 yards. Fabric touch bad, clipping is not good! Cuff is tightening, is very badBad shopping at a time
1,Too small bad fit
1,It's a nice looking shirt but after wearing and washing it only once, there's a hole in the armpit area. Not good quality.
1,I just got it in the mail and the shelf itself looks good but it came with NONE of the hardware to set it up with so I have no way of actually using it.
1,I've had these for a few weeks now and I've found myself liking them less and less. The material is see-thru and not warm enough to wear alone in the cold winter season. I expected a much better quality product.
1,I have several pairs of crocs, and am happy with them.  I read the reviews of this product and noted that some said the size was too small. I should have listened.		The size, front to back and side to side is fine.  In fact, after reading the reviews I made sure I got them big enough and was worried that they would be too big.  They are very roomy, and may even be "too big" on the sole.  HOWEVER, the problem is in the cut of the upper part of the shoe; of the brown area.		There is simply not enough space; there is too little material "vertically". I've never had this issue in a shoe before; bizarre.  It's the TOP of my big toe -- on top of the toenail -- that lacks space.		Wish I had bought these from zappos so I could return them now.  I gave them over a month, hoping that they would stretch out and I could wear them.  No joy.  To the thrift shop they go.		NOT RECOMMENDED.
1,They seem much nicer in the picture than on. I usually love Skechers but there is a bit of an unpleasant aspect to these shoes. The eyelets are set much wider apart than expected. It feels like most of the upper part of the foot is covered by the tongue.
1,if your  a  size  2  Japanese  chick  you love it.  otherwise  pass.
1,Price was reasonable,shipping was quick, the product should not even be on the market! The lenses are so dark that  you have to be in BRIGHT sunlight in order to see anything at all. I cannot recommend these glasses for anything.
1,Tarnished links and defective hinges! Not a good deal!
1,If you are full busted this might be cut way too low for you.  I found myself bulging out of this bra in the middle as I am very full busted.  Didn't work for me at all, so sending it back.  Nice and soft material, tho, so it is too bad.
1,Nice design but poor quality tee shirt.
1,Left a big irritation  mark on my back and the straps will not stay up.
1,I bought two of these bags. One came with around 8-10 cut off rags...mostly old UNBLEACHED t-shirts. The second came with three cutoffs. Which i wouldnt even consider them cutoffs. It seemed to me they were just cut once down the middle and folded up and shoved in the bag. Granted it is the weight that determines how much you get but one would think that there's no way three cut up shirts would weigh a pound. My other concern with this purchase is they are unbleached cut off rags. So if you are going to do anything with them in terms of staining or finishing i would consider another item lot if you don't want bleeding of the shirts into your finish. I used mine mostly for dust cleaning.
1,bought three pairs in different colors and they are all uncomfortable.
1,I wear a 42 D. Ordered the extra large and it didn't fit on my nose. Band was very tight and there was no support. At all. Returned for refund.
1,I returned this product. The fabric is not comfortable at all and, while the shirt fit nice, the pants were too baggy and too long, but they fit tightly at the waist. Didn't make sense. I bought cherokee instead and they are perfect!
1,My husband wore this for a week and then it broke.
1,After wearing them 3 times they look terrible~~  The tops have crease marks where the toes bend, and the welt is frayed . . .	I'm embarrassed to wear them.  Would be disappointed if I'd paid $20 for boots at Walmart and they wore like these have!!
1,These run huge and have a chemical odor.  Not for my liking, thought they are made well.  They are squishy, and very wide and big.
1,I ordered a size smaller and it was still too big.
1,Arrived BROKEN. Don't waste your money.
1,I was ready to really like this bra.  And it looks great in front but the sides, despite being a "side panel" bra, which I mistakenly thought would give more side support - it spills on the sides in an alarming manner.  I saw this on the model in the picture but due to some other reviews decided to try it anyway.  Well.  Imagine that model with a significant sideboob.	The underwire doesn't feel the side as high as it could, but I even tried readjusting the wire (thus leaving it short at the front) and it did not make any difference.  I tried a few sizes down (all that was available). It was too small but still not working on the side.
1,One boot had a scratch on it when I took them out the box and I did not return because I did not want to go through the process and one scratch is not that bad.  But a month later when I decided to wear them I took one step in the scratched boot and the whole front of the boot crack with lines across the front. That day was two days after the warranty. I do not recommend these boots.
1,Item did not last me a month. It seems rotten?  Was hoping for a decent anklet to last me this will not be the one. Let's just say I paid less at another store for a much better quality one and that one has at least lasted me 7 months!!!! Don't waste your money!
1,These do not stay clipped well.
1,The opening in the front is entirely too small for an adult male unless he is abnormal.
1,was disappointed in the quality I had expected better
1,would have loved them if they had held up in the wash. The got stretched out somehow in the wash and now just fall off of me
1,They gave me blisters on the sides of my ankles but fit perfectly. However I only wore them for a week on vacation so maybe they have to be broken in.
1,ok but fall apart easily. also when i got them the sole was already unglued i the front  :(
1,Not bad for the price.
1,It's a shirt. Not long enough to be worn as a dress.
1,Cheap and thin material. Even looks cheap on. Very small.	BUT super cute design. Too bad I'll have to give it away. Be aware that the color displayed in the image won't be entirely accurate.		Order a size up for sure!
1,I will never buy from this company again.  Items were missing.  Each item was a different size.  The quality stinks.  And, what ever possessed me, as a woman, to buy from a company with such sexist photos still amazes me.  What was I thinking....Opps, I wasn't.
1,It's pretty but leaves much to be desired. The sizing is way off, i'm 5'1 1/2, 120. 32DD the straps were way too long, the breast pockets were odd and bulged out at the sides, the waist fit but there's no "privacy" fabric between the laces, the laces felt very fragile like they could tear apart at any moment.  Very disappointed, shipped back the same day I got it. Would not recommend even for the price..
1,Received this product with a broken zipper and although the product was/is easy to return, I think it is way too short for my 5'9 figure... Wouldn't recommend.
1,returning item to stiff feels like cardboard
1,Came apart after three wearings
1,Cheap, cheap, cheap looking.  I would NOT buy again.  Looks like something out of a bubble gum machine.
1,The boots look nice, but sizing must be off. I normally wear a 10.5 in shoes and 10 in boots. So I ordered size 10 with the narrow toe. They feel really big on my feet and have what feels like an inch of space in the toe. I will be sending them back not sure if I want to try another size.
1,Doesn't lay on your neck!
1,These could be so much better if they came in different sizes to accommodate the top of the shoes and if the grooves were deeper. They constantly come undone. I love the idea but unfortunately they are not durable nor reliable.
1,Not the best material. I also noticed a orange streak running across the entire shirt.
1,It is a nice color, but the belt felt a bit on the cheap side. The buckle was supposed to be brushed, but the top and sides were a very shiny chrome. Returned for another ratchet belt
1,Horrible! Do not buy unless you are looking for something of bad quality, thin and unravels immediately. This should be sold for a dollar per package at the dollar store.
1,I found that this dress ran rather large. Not recommended for shorter individuals unless you want it coming down fully below the knee. I returned it.
1,The fleece was soft and cozy but the sizing was way too large so I returned the robe.
1,terrible sports bra, it just makes a huge boob, very uncomfortable and doesn't provide much support
1,My baby is 9 months old so I ordered the 6-12 month costume & it is way too BIG. It will fit her for next Halloween, but not this year :(
1,This is a nice looking bra and comfortable, but the cup doesn't pull down far enough or stay down well. As a nursing bra, it's lacking.
1,all the asian size conversion are completely wrong	their proportions are not meant for the Americas
1,Disappointed, reviews stated size is exact.....this is way small.
1,I need a size 4 ring. I order size 5 that ran a little big. Thank you.
1,I put them on and immediately took them off and returned them.  They were far too wide.  Bummer because they were pretty.
1,Garment is extremely THIN and not the same quality of underwear I purchased from Haynes 4 yrs ago	I doubt their durability
1,size was not accurate.  Pants run almost two sizes too small.
1,Like most people, I've had hundreds of shades... these lasted about 2 days!
1,Um, better save your money even its cheap already
1,Sizing terrible
1,the material is not as expected
1,It is very wide at the sides and at the same time very short
1,really ran small
1,Wrong size.
1,Scratch, stiff, uncomfortable- only wear with a dress up outfit its needed for but then cant wait to get it off
1,It broke the first time I wore it... looked study but its not... I would not purchase again... I ended up having to pick up all the little pieces but what do u expect for the price? And the shipping took for ever!
1,Ordered this in wide, and it's even narrower than a regular shoe.  Hurt too much to even walk around in.  I'm really disappointed because it's a beautiful boot.
1,Runs big. Mine were too big. I had to ship them back.
1,way too small all over not fitting right
1,Cool looking shirt, but holes formed after 1 wash. Will not purchase again due to quality issues. Great idea...bad execution
1,Not particularly pleased....sleeves are actually more of a 3/4 length, and absolutely agree with previous posts that the length is completely misrepresented.  Very wide and slouchy but considerably short.  Proceed with caution.
1,Returned, too big and not worth the money
1,One shoe is bigger than the other. I have many Toms and this is the first issue I've had where one fits and the other is too large. It is large enough to where my heel falls out.
1,I had to send this sweater back it was WAY too small and its very thin.
1,Am tall, these were too short
1,Oh boy, where do I begin with these sunglasses? Okay, I'll make this short and sweet. . . Bottom-line: Don't waste your money! I'm not into buying expensive designer sunglasses but these are by far the cheapest and most poorly constructed sunglasses I've ever purchased!  First of all, they feel very flimsy; as if they could break at the drop of a hat.  After putting them on for the first time, I noticed that the left eye was tinted slightly darker than the right eye.  This made them really annoying to wear and no matter how much I tried to adjust to the color difference, it was just uncomfortable.		So you're asking, "could there be more???"  Unfortunately, there's more!.  As I began to adjust the nose pads, the right nose pad fell off.  Of course I could not find the tiny screw that was supposed to hold it in place, talk about annoying.  I didn't think that was too big of a deal, annoying yes, but I figured I could replace the screw later.  I decided to adjust the left nose pad, thinking maybe I can get that one where I wanted it until I replaced the other nose pad on the right side, but to my chagrin, the entire nose piece snapped off from the frame! Yeah, within the first 15 minutes, I had lost a nose pad and an entire nose piece and the lenses were different shades.  My final complaint about these sunglasses is that, when the sun is super bright, as it is in the morning when I am driving east toward the interstate, the glare from the mirror lenses make it nearly impossible to see through the lenses.  I can't see anything through them except my own eyes and I have to remove them until I am not headed directly toward the sun which is the purpose for wearing them in the first place!		I was really looking for a simple pair of mirrored aviators and for $3.99, I thought it couldn't hurt to try them out.  There's definitely no doubt that you get what you pay for! Save your money . . .go buy yourself an ice cream cone or something you'll really enjoy!
1,Not the cutest shoes but pretty comfortable. I have wide, small feet and it's a real pain for me to find shoes! Now that I'm over 6 months pregnant, I need walking shoes without having to tie laces all the time, and these seem like they'll work out well for me.		UPDATE: I've worn these a few times now, and I would say that they're not as comfortable as I initially thought. It could just be because I'm pregnant, and my feet may be swelling and unswelling slightly from day to day (although I'm not noticing any change in the way my other shoes feel)		The right shoe was really hurting at the back of my ankle yesterday, and I ended up getting a blister. I think I regret buying shoes that have no adjustability... I might look for something with velcro so that I can loosen a little when needed.
1,I got this for my husband because he was searching for a shoe shine kit.  We wanted to like this but it simply isn't powerful enough.  It also doesn't seem like it would hold up to many uses either.  I didn't return it because it cost as much to return as it did to buy it so now I have it in a closet collecting dust.  I don't recommend it if you want power in your polisher.
1,Color was nothing like it is in the picture. Material is  pretty cheap looking...
1,Disappointed
1,i ddid not like this product, the material is poorly made and they were too big they must run big
1,looks nothing like the picture.cheap and fake looking. waste of money!!!
1,too small just like blouse
1,Stitching on 2 of the 3 pairs in a pack are coming loose on the front. Such a shame. Poor quality. I will not continue to buy this brand :(
1,I ordered size 38 D. the waist was perfect but the chest was not fit well as the picture show it was too big.
1,WARNING. This item is fine lengthwise for fit, but, unless your toes are the size of a six year old these will not allow your foot to go in and there is no adjustment like a bit of elastic.  I tried with a six year old & her toes fit fine, it may also fit if you don't have a big toe & only 4 toes on each foot.  I wish I would have tried them on when I could have returned them instead of relying on Bass' quality.
1,This wig is awful. It was way to small for my boyfriends head and you can see the mesh clearly through. The wig cap is black so you can see it when the wig is on, ugh. The only thing I liked about this wig was the natural blonde color it is. The consumer really needs to fix this product. Most of the time I have loved their wigs but this one was a huge failure.
1,good materials, nice colors (the picture is deceptive). I could not stand it for more that a couple of hours and had blisters after that.
1,I liked the wallet but since mine broke as soon as I unzipped it I never used it. It was more hassle to mail it back so I threw It away. It was cute but much smaller than I except expected.
1,I had a pair before that was identical to this one and those fit fine.  It turns out that these (even though listed as medium) are wide and pretty large, flopping on my feet when I walk.  I do not understand how one can buy a prior pair that fit fine and then get a second pair in the same size and those be too large and too wide!  I paid a lot of money for these, but am dissatisfied with how they fit.
1,In this jean my bottom looks bigger that what my hubby told.
1,Too small
1,Marked as ages 6-8, it should of said size 6-8.  Too small for my grandson.  I will find someone to pass them on to.
1,I really wanted this costume but when I got it the hat was crushed and deformed. Couldn't wear it, it made me sad :(
1,This watch looks a lot better in pictures than in person. I don't mind big watches but the way that this watch is designed makes it look bulky. The dial window is mineral glass, but it looks a little foggy, unlike other watches that I own that also use mineral glass. The fake diamond at the top also adds a cheesy and cheap look to this watch.		Cons:	- Bulky	- Not very clear glass	- Fake diamond		Pros:	- Nice color and finish	- Nice band and clasp		Overall, I am a bit disappointed that this is a fossil watch. I did expect better from Fossil.
1,I bought this watch 6 months ago and decided to take it into the pool. The watch got water inside the face. I was dissapointed because it is a divers watch. I called invicta for warranty service. Invicta requires a check for $28.00 so they can ship it overseas for repair. I only paid $100.00 from amazon. So I have to pay 33 pct of the purchase price so they can ship it to be repaired under warranty.
1,The medium was ginormous. The material is very cheap polyester feeling, like it would make noise if your arms brushed your sides when you walk.
1,The shoe looks nice and is comfortable; however, it is poorly made.  After only 4 wears, the string (which should be leather) holding the tongue to the shoe broke, so the shoes started falling apart.  Also, you can't wear these shoes without socks or they start to stink.  It's unlike leather loafers, which one can wear without socks or the smell.  I returned them for a refund..
1,weird looking. don't get it for a boy.........
1,The inner part of the dress is deceiving, it's to small.
1,I have several pairs of Havaianas slim width.  These are not slim width, returned.
1,The item was delivered quickly but the material was extremely thin; paperthin.	I returned the product. It was not what I expected neither worth the cost of it
1,I purchased Hanes because I have always trusted their brand for underwear.  Previously, they have fit well, breathed well, and were made of quality and durable materials.  In fact, they usually last me for several years.  Not so with these.  I was very disappointed.  The material was very thin, not breathable, and fit tighter.  And after the first couple of washes, they have started to deteriorate.  Seems are coming undone and there are long strings and fringes.  For the price, that is absolutely unacceptable.  My OLD underwear looks better than the new ones.
1,My feet, 6 medium (via usual metal measuring tool). My left, larger; still a 6. Arches, average. Foot shape, between "tapering toes" & "square" (see pix). At 5'2 & 119, neither are my feet chubby; 58 years, no foot issues. 1/22/16, ordered a 6 med; was long enough, no toe-touching; width, snug. Removed my thin sock, the left was still so snug it squeezed a foot bone which "moved/clicked" as I walked. Time won't fix this much "snug"; my feet deserve wider from the start anyways. INNER sole is completely flat; NO arch despite the looks of the outer rubber sole & reviews raving about "support" of which I read 12+ pages before deciding to buy. The "comfort" reviews along with the looks of the outer sole led me to presume that the inner might be support-shaped; no, it's flat; hope my pix show that. Inner liner is NOT real sheepskin fleece; it's labeled: "60% sheepskin; 40% polyester"; zoom to view. "Stone" = light & dark taupe. I photo'd it atop my "Graystone Metallic" 08 Tahoe (google the color) in sun to compare. Free Shipping; free return; yay Amazon!
1,Color is different, lighter, and its too tight
1,I read hours of reviews before buying this.  I wear a 14 so I ordered the plus size.  I didn't want it to be too tight.  Another review mentioned not having to pull their leggings up all day and I've experience the same problem so I was encouraged that these have a  high waist.  However, when I tried these on, they were still a little small, especially the fabric height on my lower back above my butt was a bit low for my comfort.  And I noticed there was a hole in the crotch area...probably resulting from putting on the leggings.  So, I can't imagine these plus size leggings would fit may women since I'm on the smaller end of plus size and I probably have the max rear that will fit these.  The quality isn't good if it tore after 5 minutes.  Maybe that's a problem with fleece limned fabric durability? Regardless, I'm returning these.  Very disappointed.  I really just wanted a nice pair of leggings.
1,Very frustrated with this pair of jeans, we have been buying the same style for years and this is the first time we have had a problem and now a problem with both pairs. One leg was a full 1.5 inches longer than the other and we took them away before realizing so and to pay $20 to get them hemmed which was half the cost if the jeans
1,Did not match the color of a sage burnish	Appears to be more light black	Can u resend the real sage burnish color
1,So happy to get it and try it out.  First thing I did when I pulled it from my purse (small interior pocket to keep it protected) was notice the beautiful Lily Flowers insert fell off.  So now all I had was a silver button with the folding hook.  The second thing to happen was the hook wasn't long enough to clear the thickness of the bar... missed by a fraction of an inch.  I've since glued the Lily Flowers back on and seek out thinner tables at which to sit and carry a tube of glue, just in case.
1,We didn't receive the one that we ordered. It felt super cheap and awful. We were not a fan.
1,Was too small
1,Plastic looking
1,I've  had skechers before and never had a problem with the size. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger due to the online reviews and when i got them they were still to small and the toe of the shoe is round which makes for a weird fit. Very disappointing.  So if your considering  purchasing these shoes i would try a whole size above what you normally wear.
1,Although I previously bought precisely this brand in the same size a few years ago, this was so large I could have fit a canteloup in the excess fabric.  Sometimes things are mismarked, but that's why buying underwear online is tricky.
1,These shoes looked good and they were marked down quite a bit.  The reviews said how comfortable they were but they were not comfortable for me at all so they had to go back.
1,I learned a hugh lesson by buying these shoes on line.  Every step I took the strap on the side fell down.  I don't know if it was my feet or the shoes were faulty but never again from Aerosoles.
1,These things were big, heavy and clunky. My son did not like them.
1,the chart says small 4-6, the package says small 24 months - 2t.
1,They fit good, but the quality is cheaper than the originals, stitching on the lower leg not much there to stitch, haven't worn them yet i washed them, still fit fine curious to see how  they last.. price is a little high for the type of quality, we'll have to see how  they wear a may have to just stick with JCPenney's, better quality. I should have done my homework, these are actually made Mexico.
1,Horrendous quality...my daughter wore for ONE day...yes, ONE day....the 'shiny' layer peeled off at the knees, and "wore" off in the crotch area.  My wife was so disgusted, she implusively threw them in the garbage...I didn't have the chance to return for a refund.
1,Shoe is not true to size. Disappointing for the kids since they were looking fforward to wearing this with their school uniform. In the hustle and bustle of back to school I took too long to send it back so we're stuck with them. Lacks arch support and can be hard to put on. Maybe they'll fit in another two years.
1,very cheaply made and hate the strap in the back it just doesn't fit right. nothing I liked about it at all
1,This product did not live up to the Cole Haan name at all. Very poorly made. I could tell from right out of the box that these needed to be returned. The finishings all the way around were terrible and the shoes looked like they were going to look shabby and start coming apart in a few wearings. Its a shame because I like to be able to trust my mens shoe companies, and Cole Haan always offered great quality, and great consistency. I am pleased that I was able to print the return label online without calling a call center in another country because I find those phone calls extremely stressful.
1,I really wanted to like this dress, but it was way too small (even though I used the size chart provided by the seller).  Very disappointing.
1,I ordered the bright yellow. It looks more like a faded old yellow. Not cute. Also it was too small in the boobs /big band and my boobs looked flat and spread out. Just all around unflattering. Im a 34ddd or 34f pre preggo. 36H/I nursing. This is not for the big busted at all.
1,I bought these for myself and my husband for work to replace the mw1569 style we have been using. My left toe went numb and has never come back. I had to return mine. However my husband loves his. I will review his with 5 stars accordingly.
1,I didn't like the fit of this bra.  Because it is a Bali, I had high hopes for it but ended up returning it.
1,Very stiff shoe, like those cheap ones for $10.	NO arch support. Extremely disappointed
1,I am really disappointed about today's quality of the 501-01-65 black jean.	Since 20 years I am wearing these products, especial the 501, but since they	are made in Pakistan the quality is worse then ever.	I am German citizen living in Hungary at the border to Austria.	Last time I was in Germany at	Chemnitz in a Levis shop. The sold black pants were full of white yarn, now	I ordered a 501 in Hungary and I got one whit a textile weave error.	The reason I could not order at Amazon.com is, that there are restrictions	from Levis it self! You should know, that the product is more expensive in	Germany or Hungary then it is in the US!	The pants are costing between 70-90-s over here in Europe! I do not think	this is the right quality for that price!	Shame on the quality politic of these kind of producers!	PS.: Of course, I wrote an email amn Levis! Guess! No answer!		Jan 31, 2012: Half a year later still no answer! From the US they forwarded my email to Poland, but	the polish did not do anything at all! A can not understand how a big name like Levi's	is going to be ruined!!! Isn't there any Owner interested in these cases? Is the	company owned by China or Afghanistan?
1,I ordered the largest one but in fact has the size of SMALL !!! It is not fair!
1,Crocs usually have fantastic arch support. This style not so much. Easy to get on though.
1,The quality is horrible. I ordered this tank a couple of years ago and the material was much thicker, this new version is so thin. I tried returning, but it was more effort than just keeping and using for a coverup or something. I do not recommend at all, super super cheap material.
1,I have purchased Brooks Adrenalines for years but I am done.		The first pair was very comfortable and lasted for a few years of moderate use.  The latest 3 pairs have lasted a few months with moderate use.  The mesh top of the toe area is very, very, very weak and it begins to fray along the edges and easily develops a hole.  I have other sneakers with similar mesh ventilation but with much stronger mesh which do not have this issue.		I like the fit of these even though I always replace the insole for more support but I am done with the poor quality in what is a pretty expensive shoe.
