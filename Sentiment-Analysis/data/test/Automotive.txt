0,Awesome ATF fluid, I can honestly say it has extended the life of my car's transmission and has managed to smooth out the bumpy gear shifts. Worth the price, if you can afford it. Make sure you purchase a brand new filter and a new pan seal if you plan to change your fluid, don't ruin this by simply draining the fluid and replacing it. The filter works hard to keep the fluid clean, but that doesn't mean it will last for ever. Preventative maintenance isn't optional, unless you're independently wealthy or don't need a car. I'd give it five stars, but the cost is somewhere between high and outrageous. That being said, it is less expensive than a new transmission, so it gets four stars.
0,buy all my parts through Amazon and have never had a problem!	fit my 2002 Ford Ranger V6 3.0
0,Works great, shuts off fast.  Only down fall, it will drip when the power is off.  I'm used to regular non automatic nozzles, when your done,	you wiggle and shake and get the little bit of fuel out of tip of nozzle.  With these, they will drip a small little puddle when the other types will	only drop one or two drops.  Makes a difference with the nozzle on top of my painted tool box on my truck.
0,This is about the best out there for stopping water leaks.
0,Fits like a glove in my 2012 challenger and are of a good quality. Very happy with the purchase so far.
0,Takes practice using it to work right
0,Perfect fit fast shipping
0,Altough pricey, The price was definitely cheaper than the dealer. So I suggest all to get product  this from Amazon.		You definitely need something like this  for your Odyssey to keep the trunk clean of mud. In places well into the trunk. However, it is not very snuggy and thick as it looks in the photo. Furthermore, after few cloappses of seats, the liner bend on one side. Since it does not tightly snug, when collapsing the seats, sides catch up and bends.		Overall, however, you need this products. I just think that it should cost no more than $40.
0,Fel Pro makes the best gaskets, good price & delivered on time
0,Works great.  Fit perfectly on SnowKing snowblower, with Tecumseh engine HMSK80-155556T.  I added a gas filter to hopefully extend the life of this carburetor.  The snowblower start easily now, even in super cold weather.  Had no issues with all winter long!
0,Use on rubber and gaskets on my BMW. Good product.
0,easy to place it
0,just like original
0,2003 mercury marauder/This stuff works.. just buy it and even if it dose not work it sure won't harm your car its top quality.but it sealed my leak i was pretty surprised and no it will not show results right away took my car about 3 days to cycle this stuff to seal my very leaky power steering one bottle of this stuff to treatments is all i needed
0,Brightest lights  i be ever had
0,Great shock for the price
0,great product
0,It's what I expected, original product. Barbaro.
0,It worked immediately after connecting to 16 pin terminal. The display shows all neccesary data, dtc, vin, rpm, among others
0,very good. great all the time
0,Fits perfect on my 2008 Chevrolet Colorado. Nice to have the armrest not sinking under my elbow anymore.
0,Pretty awesome , instead of a bluish white, it's a bright white, I use them for my license plate lights, I'm definitely going to buy more
0,One of these bottles will last you a very long time. A little goes really far with this product and it does leave the tires looking really nice. It gives a little shine which is perfect.
0,Great Buy!!
0,quick delivery, decent size and quality.
0,perfect 2003 honda xr50
0,Great Pens
0,Just taking them out of the package and checking them out they seem very well made
0,great little winch for the money.		I have more than one of these... I use one for my bow draw-board, one for my trailer to help me load large object, and one for my deer cleaning station to hoist up critters.		DOES NOT COME WITH ROPE/LINE!!!  Order some "550 cord" to go with it ($3-$7)...  double it over and tie it on.
0,Lots of lifting support. Almost too much because unless I mitigate the opening of the rear window on my camper shell these will flip the window up so fast that it flexes the strut mounts and I'm worried they are going to snap or bend one day.
0,Excellent
0,Fits my 09 Gixxer like a glove.
0,This leak dye is a must-have product for any A/C mechanic. You can even see leaking evaporators with this dye, look at the water drain!
0,A good stiff brush for the tire sidewalls
0,Fantastic!
0,Great product. I came back and ordered a second one when I received my first because I was so satisfied with the product. Would recommend black bolts to complete the look.
0,Really works well, worth every penny.
0,OK
0,replaced the hood sticker on my 2010 jk mountain edition. Looks just as good as OEM sticker.
0,Excellent stuff -- has 'PEA' a detergent found in the recommended 'top tier' fuels that has been proved to keep deposits from forming [ google it yourself and be amazed] there are non top tier fuel stations around me and i use about 1/5 bottle per tankful to make it a top tier fuel. This is much more cost effective compared to other cleaners with PEA. Have a new GTI and Crosstrek and use in both.
0,I couldn't tell where my leak was coming from or even what fluid it was so I was hesitant to give this a shot.  I park my car outside and my leak was too small to determine what the fluid was because it was dry every time I noticed it on the lot.  I had a pretty strong suspicion that it was the coolant since I had been having to top it off more frequently than in years past, but I also knew my car was burning oil so both fluids needed to be topped off regularly.  Alas the winter came and first snow I was able to detect the reddish colored snow near the drip location so I decided to buy this.		I have a 2006 Audi A4 Quattro with a turbo and this sealed my leak within 24 hrs.  Couldn't be more happy with this.
0,Wonderfull
0,Perfect fitment. Works like the OEM one except this one is the charcoal version. Not sure how much better it is because I didn't notice a real difference. For the price though it sure beats buying it direct from BMW dealerships. Super easy to install, literally just 6 screws right on top of the engine bay by the windshield. Easily done by even the least mechanical person. After taking out the 6 screws it pops off and you can unsnap the old filter of the holder. Snap in the new one and put it back on with the 6 screws.
0,Good
0,All good
0,This thing is awesome. I love being able to read the voltage too. That feature has come in handy with my older car. No complaints I love it. Thinking of buying a second unit!
0,I have used Bando belts for a long time and have always had good experiences with them. i have not installed this belt yet, but I expect the same long life I have achieved with its predecessors.
0,I am running a microwave with this in a big truck and have plenty of power.
0,This was perfect for replacing a bad o2 sensor on the  exhaust manifold on a Toyota Venza with v6 engine.
0,Very yellow, and very bright.
0,Nice set. Has quite a few of the harder to find bits that you cant get at big box stores.	mine was in a red blowmold case.
0,good
0,I've been having no complaints or whatsoever about this oil. I've been using Mobil 1 full synthetic for my truck and synthetic for my motorcycle. It never gave me any issue. So far, I'm satisfied with Mobil 1. Just hoping the quality of their products won't degrade. Highly recommended.
0,Replaced the factory antenna in less than 5 min. I rarely listen to radio, but the factory antenna is a bother at the car wash. This one gives a much better, stockier appearance and works well.
0,I couldn't find any pictures additional pictures of this bag to see what the pockets or size was, so I decided to buy one to find out for myself.		The bag is very durable.  It's actually large enough for a motocross helmet with the neck brace.  I wasn't expecting it to be that large.  It has some padding but with the bag being so large your helmet will still move around inside.
0,The dealership wanted $90 to install the cabin filter in my 2011 armada.  It took me 5 mins to get to the old filter (which my car did not come with, so don't be surprised if yours doesn't).  The only issue I had is I didn't know which direction the air flow went, but a quick youtube search showed me the right way to put them in.  Total project took me ten minutes.
0,This remote has great range, and was very easy to program with the included instructions.  It is definitely an aftermarket remote, but works well so who cares.	It is worth noting, but not enough to give it less than 5starts....The buttons stick out much farther than a factory remote.  This leads to unintended locking and unlocking of doors when it is in your pocket.  But for the price, you can't go wrong.
0,Surprisingly clear vision from the front-surface mirror, and the convex shape gives a very wide-angle view.  But be careful as you become accustomed to this mirror - Objects such as cars and trucks behind you are considerably closer than they appear.  Always rely on your side-view mirrors and direct vision when merging or changing lanes!		The mirror fits snugly on the factory mirror in my 1998 Nissan.  It's very light in weight and does not shift out of alignment when you don't want it to.		I am very happy with the purchase.
0,.had a vent that was about EXACTLY like this one, and my trailer was built in 1969.		Unscrewed the beauty plate from the inside, banged out the top enough to use an inside stool to chip away from roof top the lining -- AFTER removing the screws from top side -- and after scraping down roof -- applying a new tube sealant to inside of new unit, re-using original screws -- different hole placement, it was EASY PEASY  seriously start to finish about 40 min...		my trailer is OLD messy with issues, but this made it nice.  $20 and sealant and DONE.		on the spot at the site...no power used.
0,Works good
0,We had just bought a used Lexus RX300, and of course the power antenna worked fine----------until we go it home!! I started looking at sites on how to replace/fix it and it looked not too difficult. And I was referred to Amazon to purchase this one, that was made to fit our car perfectly. It arrived today, Amazon Prime 2 day shipping. We had it done in less than 15 minutes!!! It takes two people, one inside turning the radio on or off, and the other outside working the old and new antenna. Very happy, and for less than $25 where as the dealer would have easily over $ 150 or even more. Thank you God, then thanks to youtube for the how to video and to Amazon for having what I needed at the price I wanted to pay!!	have a great day	God Bless
0,The best thing that you can say about a gasket is that it did the job.  They won't make your life better, help your kids with their homework, or raise your standing at "the club". These did the job.
0,Work great on my Nissan. I haven't noticed any increase in fuel economy, but I was able to get home with a busted CV axle after a day of wheeling (by simply unlocking the hubs). That alone is worth it.
0,Works as described.
0,Love these headlights. I put these in my C250 sport and it looks just like I have HID bulbs in there. I am very pleased with this purchase and depending on how long they last I would buy again.
0,It is soft and thin enough to get in the rims.  The black cover came off when I shook it once, but I could slip it back on.
0,Says it all
0,Awesome!  Smoother and better!
0,Just want you want for your new Outback.
0,I originally bought this product to care for my leather sofa, it kept it looking great for over a decade until I sold it.  I recently bought a leather shoulder bag and bought some more of this to condition that leather, it worked great.  It is light leather so it darkened it a bit but did it in a unform way.  I had enough left over to condition a pair of leather shoes.		If it is leather this product will help keep it looking great.
0,just the right thing
0,I was genuinely surprised that it shipped and arrived as per Prime.	Great oil, quietens an older engine and is made to tip top standards- you get what you think you are getting, which isn't always true of lesser oils.
0,Would give these more than 5 stars if i could. Unfortunately I put these to the test the first trip out. I recently picked up an old military trailer. It had a very shady chain attached to a piece of angle bolted on to the tongue. Welded on a heavy duty 1/2 link and attached these cables. Also bought a new Connor hitch pin at the same time for my receiver. Well, that pin either broke or didn't lock and fell out on a short trip to Costco. The receiver hit the ground and these cables were flawless. Wasn't going fast but they kept the trailer in line with the jeep until i could move over to the shoulder. Worked great and there didn't seem to be any damage to the plastic sheathing when everything was sliding around back there.
0,Best I have had

0,Come and take this sticker...I dare you!
0,This cable was a godsend.		I'd been trying to figure out the cause of a CEL on my 2007 Subaru Forester for the better part of a year.  I was using the handheld scanner I'd bought locally for seventy-five dollars a few years back; it lets you clear the code, and shows the numerical code, but not much more.		For the price of this, it's a steal.		I ran this connected to a laptop running XPSP3.  The cable comes with a quick instruction sheet, that was unnecessary, but a nice touch.  I downloaded the software (and latest firmware upgrade) off the website, and entered the license code on the CD cover; no trouble installing software, or having cable detected.		Everything just 'worked' the first time I hooked it up to my car, AND, with the actual numbers (for PIDs), I was able to see that the part wasn't bad, but the wire (due to no change in the measured value...)... and had it sorted within a few days.		The software (OBDWiz) was great for a complete n00b like me; it was intuitive, and legit.  (And probably is most the cost, since the cable's sleek, but not exactly $44 worth of copper...).		I couldn't be happier with this; especially for the price, I feel like I got an incredible bargain.  I bought this cable, along with two others, at the same time; the only downside is that this is USB, and not bluetooth; however, that's not always a downside, since there's one less thing you have to worry about, if it's not working.
0,Losing presets/memory settings can be a pain.  Especially on my computer heavy cars.  One touch windows, etc... However, this little gadget  preserved everything (Radio/Satellite presets, Transmission shift patterns) everything that would normally reset after a battery replacement on my car. It gives piece of mind to see the LED lights indicating a good connection. I unplugged the old battery and carefully covered the positive battery cable with 2 rubber gloves (to avoid contact with any metal) remember, current will be running through the OBD port and you don't want to cause a short, or blow a fuse since your battery cables will be live. I would recommend as a great addition to your tool box.
0,nice!
0,I like these. Originally purchased them at Costco super cheap.
0,SUPER BRIGHT, GREAT QUALITY AND ADJUSTABILITY
0,got it
0,fit just the way I expected
0,Airtex makes the oem water pump for the 7.3 powerstroke. This went in smoothly, replaced oreillys junk reman from previous owner. Order a new motorcraft thermostat and housing while you are swapping it out. Airtex carries a lifetime warranty on their stuff. They make quality parts.
0,Good for the price.
0,These are amazingly bright! Love them
0,The 30 and 40 AMP relays are of good quality.  What else can I say, they work well!  No issues.
0,Perfect fit.  Surprised this MANN filter is made in CHINA.  I was even more surprised when I saw that the OEM filter was also made in CHINA.
0,When I was offered to purchase these at a discounted price for my opinion on the Kick mat & backseat organizer, I did not realize how great a deal this was.  I was expecting 1 kickmat (I know it states in the description 2 pack, but I thought that was referring to the 2 pockets on the organizer).  So when it arrived and I saw that there were 2 of them, I knew that I had a gotten a great deal.	I never really thought about having kick mats for my car, but just a few days before I ordered these, a friend went shopping with me, and her child was kicking the back of the seats constantly all day long, and my son is getting close to her child's age, so I knew that I had to prepare for the day that my son started kicking the seats!	So I installed these in my car, and I love them, they protect the entire seat, and they have 2 packets that I can put some toys in for my son so that he is never bored when we are in the car. They were easy to install with straps at the top and the bottom to secure it to your seat, and they have a wire frame around the edges to keep their shape.	So if you have kids, especially little ones, you need to have these for your vehicles, for the price you can't beat it, and it will help increase the value of your vehicle if you go to trade it in or sell it.
0,The answer to all your towing problems. You have all the hitch sizes and a big ass hook. I've had it for a couple years and still does its job very well.
0,worked great
0,With an extensive automotive background I only use Denso O2 sensors. This was supposed to be a replacement for the second downstream sensor on my Acura Integra. (the upstream (main) O2 sensor is new, Denso as well) The process to replace the downstream sensor is much more in depth. After more research after my order I learned it's unnecessary to replace the downstream unless there's a engine code / check engine light. The downstream just verifies the proper function of the catalytic converter. An old still functioning "main" O2 sensor (responsible for fuel enrichment) with say over 100k miles can benefit improved performance / gas mileage. Though a negotiable claim or possibly unnoticeable, my vehicles are very well maintained, while at 177k I figured it was well worth it.	All Denso O2 sensors I've dealt with are assembled in the USA with foreign parts.
0,Had a hard time finding this coil else where for a good price. Got this one fast, cheap and now my RC boat is fully up and running. Homelite parts are not always easy to find. keep that old unit running.
0,At first I was a bit annoyed the 90 degree pipe felt like a chrome coated plastic, but then realized it doesn't conduct heat and my leg stays much cooler.  The over all performance on my 1200T Harley was immediately noticed.  The only thing that would sweeten the pot would be if it came with the prefilter cover.
0,LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! Fit our 2012 Town and Country PERFECTLY. ONLY issue is getting in and out of the Stow and Go area. These mats are fantastic, durable, do what is intended...but have SUPER sharp points on the back side to hold in place. Once in, you'll never notice them. If you need to remove to access underneath, watch out!
0,Great items  and fits great on my 2017 Tacoma
0,saved me from replacing my leaking fork seals on a Triumph Tiger 800xc. turned out to be some dirt and crud stuck up in there! very simple and easy product. yes, it is just a piece of plastic, but it works great and can be reused many times if you are not too rough on it.
0,It fit my 96 Harley Davidson Road King perfectly! Major difference was made to my bike instantly. Another Great Product by Kryakyn. Plus seller was top notch Customer service.
0,Vehicle: 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium - FB25 engine		The drain plug gaskets arrived today.  They were all in good shape, clean with no rust.  They appear to be the correct size for my car.  I did receive 10 in each package.  There were two gaskets that were stuck together, but I was able to easily separate them with a small flat blade screwdriver with no issues.		I will update this review once I have installed one to confirm that they fit and work correctly with no leaks.
0,These fit very well, to the point that they look like the original equipment they are. They were a bit of a challenge to put on since I did not want to remove the rear tires to mount the flaps. There was no clearance for a drill to fit into the tight space to drill the required holes. The solution was to use a dremmel tool with the flex attachment and drill the holes with it. Both flaps took a total of about 45 minutes to install and I am very slow at this type of work. An average DIYer could have them both installed in 30 minutes or less. Only a few hand tools were needed and the instructions were clear and easy to follow.
0,solved our broken cable problem and was a breeze to install.
0,It keeps my bike up in the dirt.  Great.
0,works great
0,great and lots of light
0,I am very happy with this product.  I have it in a 2010 Camaro SS Transformer Edition. I noticed more power and sounds better with my Flow Masters.  I am happy with this product.
0,I thought these were really cool to have them installed.  If someone happens to notice these, I am sure he/she would also agree and might even want to get them too.
0,Can't say enough good things about this versatile bag.  I use it for all long and overnight rides.  The added plus of a backrest is very much appreciated.  I can remove the bag from my bike in seconds to take into a hotel or my house.  Great design and quality.
0,Great filters, I do recomend that you change them if you never have before, leaves you car smelling cleaner and my old ones were NASTY
0,Works well. Must have for anyone who owns a trailer. Can save a trip to the dealer for possibly pricey inspection! It's the trailer that has the problem 90% of the time!
0,It's great. It fits exactly in my cargo area of my 2015 RAV4.  I'm a neat freak when it comes to my car.  When I put the mat in the cargo area, I pressed my fingers all around the edges, thinking it will grip the edges better.  I recommend it to anyone wanting to keep the cargo area a little cleaner and easier to wash.

0,Great performance good value
0,Excellent
0,A must-have trying to hide a dash cam wire around the windshield!
0,I only have a small 12v Riding Mower Battery to charge so needed to replace my old broken charger.	This works great and it went directly to 12v..it showed my battery % status which is a plus over the SC-1000 model.	All in all worth the little bit extra for this model to tell you what percentage the Battery is at beginning and when its 100%	and fully charged...Light in weight over my old metal one... but sign of the times and actually a nicer looking charger ...	and if you accidentally put the clamps on wrong it will alert you.
0,I have used this for years.  I had a stuck piston ring on my 1984 22R 4x4 and would foul a plug in 500 miles.  In time after using Sea Foam in the carb while running, and the tank, really using to see if I could unstick the piston ring, I got it to 2000 miles before the plug would foul, then 5000, and now no problem.  I use it on all my Roto-tillers, lawn mowers, 89 Jeep Wranger, 84 Toyota, I put it in wifes 2016 Toyota Venza periodically,  etc.  If you use directoy in the carb, you have to add just a little and keep the revs up to keep it running.
0,Great one, love it.
0,If you are looking for a better alternative to your regular Harley Davidson 7" Headlight, this is the one to get.	Works great with the 2012 FatBoy Lo. No issues with voltage and computer throwing codes and red indicator light on speedometer.	You might need to pick up an additional o-ring frame, especially if you are running the Freight Train Nacelle. A much cheaper alternative to HD DayMaker.
0,great
0,These look exactly like the plastic rivets Dorman offers that you can pick up at your local parts stores... The 4 pack that costs $3.45 by the way. I figured even if these plastic rivets offered from Amazon last a short while I'll still be in good standing as i'm picking up a pack of 100 for less than $10.00.		I have replaced all of the clips that were on my friend's 2005 Nissan Altima the wheel well, air intake, and splash guards under the car. I highly recommend these plastic rivets. I will be picking up more of other sizes for my other cars.
0,I was skeptical at first until I used it. All I can say is it is a must have in your car along with a flashlight, water, first aid kit, and a fire extinguisher.
0,Very easy to use.
0,Works as advertised.
0,Works really well.  No streaking or residue.  Easy to use, no unpleasant odor.
0,Looks clean on the bike. Follow instruction easy to install. Fast delivery, Priced a little high, but looks great!!
0,Excellant
0,I've used them before and ove them.
0,Excellent - compatible with my 2016 Dyna
0,Two keys are only required if you don't have a laptop, OBD2 dongle and a free piece of software called FORSCAN... With that I was able to put the truck into PATS learning mode and program another key where I only had one before. You will need the enhanced license for FORSCAN which is free as well and you just have to follow their instructions to get it. Stratec has consistently been the one brand of key I can rely on to program without trouble and to look just like a factory key.
0,Excellent product.
0,Makes the repair of blown spark plugs on ford engines very easy.
0,easy to use and perfect for the one man operation!!
0,Decal is as expected. Fits perfectly
0,The weights work very well.  They are easy to apply.  After a couple hundred miles they are still firmly in place and have no indications of weakening.	The weights come packaged in a sturdy box with a slide-out tray that is much nicer than the depicted blister pack. The box is a much better storage container -- definitely a nice surprise.	A heads-up: the weights are steel, not lead.  The reason you may care is if you need to use a half of a weight (I did) you'll need bolt cutters or something similarly effective to cut a weight in half.  The old style lead weights were easy to cut with nearly any cutting implement -- these are not.  This isn't a bad thing, just something to be prepared for.
0,Great touchup to maintain clear headlights.
0,Keep these in my truck as a backup and have them handy when we are pulling our travel trailer as well.  Grteat buy compared to the local auto part stores / big box stores and you get so many of them in different amp ratings.  Have not had to use them yet but they are packaged nicely and fit in truck compartment storage just perfect.
0,Although bigger and heavier than the starter it replaced it started right up after initial installation and starts every time with out a hitch.
0,Works great on my motorhome and made airing my tires very easy. Great product, it a must on the rv
0,Well made neat features excellent value.
0,Fast shipping, easy to install. Fit exactly like the OEM part.
0,Perfect fit for my 95 Ranger. I just wish Ford didn't make it so hard to figure out which number and cut you actually need. Going down the key from the tip, the first 5 cuts are for the ignition, the last 5 operate the door. Apparently I picked the wrong one. Locksmith fixed it in about 5 mins. Installation was a breeze. You really have to wonder, if Ford put so much forward thinking into building a special place to insert a very small phillips head to make change out so easy. Why didn't they just design a lock cylinder that would last. Out of all the imports I have owned I have never once had to replace the lock cylinder.
0,Second one ive bought and works just as advertised. So easy to use and very flexible. Can go very in depth if the user decides to. Do not leave it plugged in all the time, they can be sensitive to vibrations and fail.
0,N o comment
0,I wanted to replace my old HJC CS-5N helmet (XL) so I ordered the exact same size.  XL fits nice & snug. I wear a couple different brands of hats, all at 7-3/8, so I can't believe that HJC's XL size is listed as 7-5/8 - 7-3/4.
0,Really light-weight and not magnetic. The measurements seem to be accurate.
0,Awesome Product!
0,I love silk shine. This gives me the shiny outcome, but with no oily residue to cleanup. I attend 12 car shows a year. This is in my kit regardless of what I do. I won't go back to am oily spray.
0,I have to admit this is a lot of work but the results are totally worth it.  Make sure you wear gloves.... make REALLY sure you wear gloves... but once you get done with this system you'll be thrilled with the way your car looks.
0,This was the correct filter for my 2016 Honda Fit,  it fit and performs as it should'
0,Very good match.  I have good results with  this product.
0,Works perfect for my truck.
0,Exact replacement for 2005 Nissan Murano. Item arrived exactly when promised (even a few hours before) and was in excellent shape. This part looked exactly the same as the original equipment manufacturer part on the vehicle, the only variance was that the Delphi part was mostly plastic and the oem part was metal or aluminum. This is to be expected, because a lot of aftermarket auto parts are manufactured to updated specifications due to changes made after vehicles have been on the road and	people see how parts wear and/or last in real-world use and not just tested in a lab. This part even came with a torx bit to make the installation a snap. I would recommend and purchase again for any vehicle they make this part for.
0,This is the second level I have had on fifth wheel campers.  When I am either pulling into or backing into a site it tells me instantly where the coach is at for leveling and whether or not I should add blocks to bring one or the other side up to start as close to level as possible.  Just be sure the coach is level to begin with when attaching.  It is easily seen through the back window of the truck.
0,Very nice I like how the plate laysdown. Not like the old billboard Style.
0,A little too big for my use. I might use it in the future. Good Quality Product

0,The lights are great and look amazing in my 2012 Ford F250. They were also easy to install.  Took about 10 minutes.
0,IT's a bit too small. The photo is deceiving.  Looks bigger in the photo.  Very nice though.  Fits in my 2003 Dodge RAM 1500 with the 5.9. I had to use a custom rubber O-ring though to fit my throttle body.
0,It looks good, and fit on like a glove. Definitely worth every penny.
0,Worth every penny.
0,Deal wanted $30 to replace air filter on my RAV 4. Bought this. Watch youtube video on how to install. Saved $$. You can do it too!
0,When I was travelling East Coast a motel I stayed in were giving a smaller version of this away.  But I lost it.  Same as other reviewer, I live in mountains of LA county where it snows and the windshield get frozen overnight.  Last night was one of those nights where my car windshield got frozen.  Luckily I ordered the scraper few weeks before and kept it in my car.  I remember the freebie I got from the motel took forever for me to scrape the snow/ice off the windshield but the Hopkins is much larger and better ergonomics that I was able to scrape my front and back windshield in a minute or so with easy.
0,good filter at a good price
0,Good lights, much better than sealed-beams but not quite as sharp as the EU standard. One of the bulbs had no high beam, requiring another $14 purchase and reinstallation.
0,Works as advertised!
0,Fit like a glove
0,great stuff
0,Look and work great. Easy to install.  All pickups should have these
0,good lights very bright
0,It's getting harder and harder to find these in stores as most mowers have the newer style filters these days.  If you have an early 90s to early 2000s Briggs that's still serving you well and you want to keep it that way, grab a couple of these and keep them handy for future maintenance.
0,I know these type of products aren't exciting to review, but b/c there were none, and I had tons of questions on them, I thought this would help someone.	Rhino Extreem to me seemed to have a nice setup, but I wasn't to keen on having their kits elbow attachment.		The Viper kit has the 15' hose with the better (solid color) removable elbow attachment with the four tiered connections for addressing the sewer.	The Viper uses four bayonet lugs on their ends for a tight seal, thick protective coating and crush proof.  Plus, it's Valterra, they have the clear four prong 45 degree elbow that fits with this perfectly.  To with Viper and your set for the long haul!
0,Takes a little to break in. Be careful the first few times. Very strong and fast. It's now perfect.
0,Great price. Nice improvement over my standard sylvania's that were previously installed. Just don't expect a miracle from them and you will be very happy.
0,I AM A VEHICLE DEAILER AND I USE THIS SOFT BRUSH ON THE LEATHER SEATS WORKS VERY WELL WITH THE DRILL  GREAT FOR ANY ONE THAT DETAILS
0,This order came with 4 led strips and is good for not only additions to the car but I added them to my boat in small tight places where we needed a bit more ambient lighting and worked wonders !
0,Full System, All System, Four System, what is it!!!  I read the reviews, the Amazon write-up, and the Autel website propaganda.  Amazon's descriptions and pricing seem to add to the confusion.  Autel customer service helped, a little.  According to Autel, they DO NOT sell online, so any Autel code reader bought online is basically a knock-off and could be anything.  Further, any sold by a store in the US is legitimate, and is the "all system" version.  Autel does not sell the others inside the US.		This model is about $150 cheaper than the "all systems" unit on Amazon, as well as those in the auto parts stores (the "real" ones).		I needed a code reader and have had generally good support from Amazon, so figured I'd risk it, and send it back if necessary.		Some have mentioned that the website would not recognize their unit, or that the updating was painfully slow.  This is what I did (mostly, followed directions in the manual, which you can download from Autel's site before you buy):		1.  created an account on the Autel website (don't need any information regarding the unit to create an account)	2.  registered the unit (with info you find at "setup/about" when you connect it to your PC to power it up)	3.  copied the entire SD card (92,XXX files, 3.77 gigs) to my hard drive for a backup	4.  copied all those files to a 32 gig card (much more than I needed, but some mentioned the supplied SD card was too small)	5.  verified that the unit and website were happy with the substitute card	6.  updated - yes it is slow		I don't know enough to determine if it will do everything it's capable of, but I suspect it does.  I've used it to scan and clear codes on a 99 Neon, to scan and collect live (driving down the road) data on an 07 Yukon, and attempt to scan an 05 Crossfire.  The Crossfire is supposed to require equipment that only some authorized dealers have, but I got a basic scan, and the machine found no trouble codes.  What the machine told me matched well with known information for the Neon and Yukon.  It did not correctly identify rat damage on the Crossfire.		I am happy.  Lots to learn now.		One significant issue.  Although the unit looked new, I had to use needlenose pliers to remove the SD card.  It had been forced in upside down (relative to the correct position, at least).  It appeared to have no damage.  It had been used to collect data on a Benz, and when I registered it, I did get a full year access to updates, but only six months warranty.  Amazon (NOT another seller) sold me a used unit.  That's disappointing, but I risk all the problems again if I send it back.  Will update if I have possibly useful info.		UPDATE 23 JUL - one email to Amazon, full warranty period will be honored.  Issue resolved easily.  Much less trouble than returning it.		Many potential problems discussed regarding this machine; not have materialized for me.		Sorry, forgot to mention - I downloaded the PC suite software from the Autel site, which seems only to let you update (that's important), and PRINT.  Some mentioned no success printing.  I connected the unit by USB cable and could print from it to the screen, basically a text file.  That I could cut and paste and do simple edits, and copy it to a Word file.  So, you can generate a printed record and save to an editable file.  That's all I know so far.
0,good seller good item
0,I bought this winch to use a power lift for my tent trailer. The tent top weighs about 500 lbs and the while the hand winch raised the top just fine, my custom trailer project needed something a little snazzier (and easier). The winch works great, lifts the top almost effortlessly..... but it is a little noisy. So far I'm perfectly satisfied, but only time will really tell. Even if it lasts only a few years, at this price, I still got my $$$ worth.
0,great deal, worked very well, just what I needed right now and future projects also
0,Was wrapped well and fits just right arrived earlier than expected. this product is east to use and would recommend to friends.
0,Just like OEM product on which the fastener blade broke off. Hope this one lasts a while. At the price, I bought two, just in case.
0,Well made and comes with plenty of wire.
0,Nice emblem
0,great product! works awesome...no more clutter on the floor as parking indicators. the cord is really long, helps with placement on the ceiling.		sensor light works great and auto shuts off.
0,Great locking hubs! They fit petfectly on my 96 f350. Good construction, I have always had good luck with the Mile Marker brand.
0,Way better handling. Especially with camper shell. Easy install. Have a buddy help.
0,all very well as expected reponsable store.
0,Modification for vent was easy.
0,Good work, great product!
0,Ordered these for a friend. When they were delivered I liked them so much that I got a pair for myself.
0,Nice solid sturdy rack. Quality at a fair price.
0,excellent for finding leaks.  I put it in new transmission fluid as well so I could see the level because it's hard to see.
0,warm and easily worn under helmet. I got this for my son and he loves it. He can wear his goggles with it much easier than two individual eye holes. That's a plus about this one too, no obstruction to see. It is warm by itself to wear when riding but the cold wind does go thru it. Course it's 40 degrees round here when he tried it. Seems like it's made really well and we recommended it to his friends and also for the price it was.
0,worked great
0,Excellent , he arrived at the estimated time and prefectamente packed . It is of excellent quality , recommended.
0,It okay. People say I look like a power ranger though.
0,Good battery for its price work very well
0,These are awesome!  So easy to install on my 2006 BMW 525Xi and work great!  Exactly what I'd hoped.
0,Works great just like it should.
0,Good belt, OEM quality. Didn't over stretch tightened up and stayed that way. Can't ask for much more out of a belt
0,Wonderful cleaner that doesnt leave residue or shiny sheen.  Cleans to a nice crisp matte, new car like finish.  Pleasant mild fragrance.
0,good
0,I love the Stars if I have to buy an entire I will shoulder by this tire again the rise beautiful and I have these install on my Mitsubishi Montero Sport XLS 3.5 L beautiful if I have to buy this tired I'll buy it again
0,Fits like a glove over the factory mirror and looks great as well. Now I can see cars behind the trailer. A++ product
0,Makes hooking up lights an absolute thoughtless process. Even if you want a different switch the harness is still a great product and good quality.
0,These shocks are awesome. I bought them while I was working one the road pulling a toy hauler, they are doing the trick. I would buy them again.
0,Great job
0,just as advertised
0,fit great
0,Well worth the money I had mine bullet lined definitely not recommend leaving bear because the finished product plastic finish is not very clean-looking but looks awesome painted or spray coated
0,Great product and price. It's done everything I needed too.
0,easy hookup and done in less than 5 minutes
0,Perfect! Arrived quickly. Packaged in a padded envelope with no damage. Directions for installation were appropriate and had it installed in less than twenty minutes. I am not a mechanic either!
0,Brand name says it all
0,It's only been in my cycle for a day, but i love the LCD readout screen on the battery itself, just for the simple fact  of know exactly where my battery is juice wise, with the press of a button.  I also purchased the battery tender and cable extensions along with the battery, which is a God-send! Attached circled end to terminals,  the other end of cable is the quick connect portion. So easy charging, and again, you can get a readout as to exactly where your battery is at... charge wise, charge rate, and how full it is!  It then tends the battery, keeping it at an optimally charged state at all times and is very easy to plug in for charging maintenance. I won't have to but another battery probably for even longer than it's declared shelf life because of the tender but when the time comes, and i need another battery,  i will be purchasing THIS battery or a newer one of this same one because of it's ease of use !
0,Aluminum mounting plate. You get what you pay for
0,Perfect color match, comes with a brush applicator, easy to use
0,Quick Installation. I painted all mounting hardware to ward off rust. Looks a heck of a lot nicer than the black tail pipe.
0,Came as described and worked great. Would order again if needed.
0,Worked fine! Just make sure to have everything lined up! Do not force!
0,Perfect for a Polaris RZR.
0,Wife is a teacher that drives a Corvette.  I guess some of the kids thought it was cool to steal the chrome valve caps off the car.  These did the trick for replacement.  No problems or losses since replacing them.
0,Great source for a necessary fuel additive.
0,Bright bright BRIGHT!!! Replaced the OE incandescent fixtures on our horse trailer with these. They are small but their brightness is at least 5 times that of the incandescent fixtures we replaced. Even in full direct sunlight you can easily see these. At night, it's like having spotlights!		Easy install and a quality built product.
0,Wasn't quite what I wanted but well built.  i thing its was well worth the price
0,Here is what I like about the charger:	Automatic - Makes it easy for others in the house to use without too much of a worry	Multiple battery types - Honestly, I will probably never use the other types, but nice to have	Auto Start - This has been the primary use of this charger so far	Compact - Makes it easy to store and bring along with or to set on the vehicle for charging	Fan cooled - Makes for less "venting" in the case which keeps a lot of the typical garage dust off the internal components		Here are my dislikes	Cable storing - Very poorly designed and not big enough to handle the power cord and cables well	LED lighting - Very hard to see the indicator lights if outside	Auto Start - The 3 minute cool down period between short bursts is annoying. I understand why it is there, it is just annoying	Clamps - They could definitely be a bit heavier		All in all, this makes for a great home charger. For most people the 100 Amp start is nice and the fully automatic nature means that you don't have to worry about damaging your battery or your property. I would recommend this for a general household that may need to charge a battery or two from time to time. If you are looking at bigger jobs like farm use, I think I would shell out some more on a wheeled charger that is designed for that kind of abuse.		Longevity - I have had the charger for a little over a year now. It has been used to jump start at least 20 times now and the biggest job was in 22 below temperatures. I had to cycle through the cool down period 4 times before I finally got the car started, but it was up to the task. Being a Schumacher, I am not concerned about this charger lasting for another 10 years as long as I treat it like an electronic charger and not just an old "dumb" charger.
0,Fast ship great price recommend highly
0,Very pleased! Works great having a mounted holder rather then trying to find somewhere to hang it.
0,Looks good perfect fitting
0,I have been looking for a good set of LED turn signals lights for my Honda Accord. I tried some switch back LED lights and was not impressed with the quality.  I read several reviews on these JDM LED and found that others where very impressed with the quality and how bright they are.
0,Performs neither better nor worse than any other liquid cleaner/wax I've used, but this one doesn't smell like petroleum--actually, it smells like Juicy Fruit gum, which is weird but tolerable--so you don't end up breathing fumes while you use it. More to the point, it works well on fiberglass and laminate counters, sinks and bathtubs, WITHOUT making your home smell like an oil refinery in Secaucus. For that reason, it gets my vote.
0,The lugs were a perfect fit and of good quality.
0,Worked well
0,Took 2 hours to fit it into my 1998 Honda Accord LX V6 Sedan. Doesn't exactly fit around the hose clamp where it connects to the throttle body, but I managed to tighten it enough. Other than that, everything was installed neatly. There was not a lot of wiggle room.	The experience is awesome. I love the sound when it hits about 4000RPM. I haven't noticed any increase in fuel economy. That's probably my fault since I have been hitting the gas pedal harder now just to hear the roaring sound.	Definitely recommended.
0,Comes without cap.  Need OEM Ford cap to be successful with this instanlation
0,lights up the entire area.
0,Meant for changing toyota oil filters. Only thing I don't like is that the tool can be hard to snug off from the filter and requires prying.
0,Works great!  I would call the Satin more of a Semi-Gloss.  I am building a 91 Mustang and sprayed the whole underside and engine bay along with any other parts I wanted black.
0,Product was new.. fit our 1999 bug perfectly.  We had lost the center emblem (VW) logo.. but you need to order this part for the 1999 GLS 2.0L model..  That's about it.. very happy with it.
0,great
0,I have always wanted a quaility well made wheel chock for my Harley.  I purchased this one to use in my garage.  It is basically the same wheel chock that Harley Davidson sells for about 30 percent less money.  I am not sure but I think Condor probally sells to Harley Davidson.  Anyway it is well made and holds my Ultra Classic, easy to load.  I would recommend to any freind. Promptly shipped via FedEx.
0,Works Great
0,These are cheaper to buy & I will buy in bulk for my next order.
0,Nice and bright. Have many different lengths of Auxbeam lights. Love them
0,My husband is very impressed with the quality and functionality of this 18 piece brake caliper tool kit.	The kit comes in a red suitcase type case with 2 clamp style hinges to keep the case closed.	The material of the tools are black oxide coated to prevent rust, high quality and comes pre-oiled.	Compresses disk brake pistons requiring right or left hand wind back and traditional push back style pistons.	Not for use on electronic calipers or some dual piston designs	Universal brake caliper tool set for use on most import and domestic vehicles	The plates are all stamped with numbers as well as the location inside the storage box, laser engraved with the Motivx Tools logo.	Must have for anyone that chooses to do their own brakes.	I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
0,These are fantastic. Used ratcheting straps, bungies, and ropes on my motorcycle for several years. Got these last year and they are super convenient and great. Used on 3000+mile road trip and they were better than any setup I had used before
0,I have used this before in the past and it is excellent.  Does a good job covering and dries pretty quick.
0,This thing works better than advertised especially when in rough terrain. Bought 33's for my jeep and the jack that came with it is very unstable when trying to lift that monster up.
0,I got the filter for free when RP ran a special; buy the oil and get a filter for free.  This combined with the RP 5W-30 synthetic oil has made a noticeable difference in how smoothly my car runs.  I hope RP runs the special again soon so I don't have to pay for the filter separately $$$.
0,Perfect match
0,Love it... classic, looks nice in my truck.
0,My car was in the body shop for a week because it had to get some work done to it. Apparently while there the rims collected some sort of dust that wouldnt come off when i gave the car a thorough wash. I became nervous thinking the rims were now stained and ruined. Then i remembered i had this cleaner. After applying i let it sit for about 2 minutes then took a sponge and started going to work. After i rinsed off the first rim i had worked on i was extactic most of it came off except for a few spots that i had missed. In essence this worked with some 'elbow grease' and took off this foreign substance that had otherwise tainted my rims!
0,It's nice quality and a perfect fit over the existing grille. Comes with the correct screws. Enough water still get's in though to cause interior leakage. So I had to modify it by putting a slight hood over it. That Seemed to work. Priced right too.
0,Since i don't have spools i bought the stand with paddles. The stand seems firm. Lifts my 01 gixxer 750 with ease. Glad i bought this item!
0,super
0,Works as indicated
0,great item
0,good
0,Heavy duty easy install 10 min to install
0,Put a twenty inch light bar on my SxS rollcage worked great !
0,Fits perfectly for Nissan Sentra 2010, nicely packaged so it would not brake.	Applied it with the supplied double sided tape that holds well although it was done in sub zero Celsius weather.	Very satisfied with this purchase, the price was excellent.	I would like to have a heated one though, but could not find it anywhere.
0,It came missing the longer screws for the door restraint screws.  Had to go buy them. Other than that, all good!
0,good to have on hand, avoiding that trip to the auto part store.  Price was great.
0,Perfect to replace my originals
0,my crown vic loves the filter. The fram i used before just did not fit well, this filter fits much better in the airbox and has more pleats than the cheap fram junk
0,This is a must have for pulling seals. It makes the job stupid easy. Using this saved me from destroying my crankshaft by gouging it with some other tool.
0,i do like it, looks very strong build , i tow around 10.000 lb for 800 miles and worked good, no problem , easy to  install, recommend
0,good tool
0,Great quality with protective cap
0,great buy.. wish it came with the l bracket too but hey not everyones kids destroy things like mine, and lose parts..lol
0,Exactly as original
0,I really have no complaint about these, except that it takes so many.  We carry 3 packages with us in our travel trailer and if the space is not level, it's not enough.
0,Cheap
0,The first pair I bought were too small so I sent them back to exchange for a larger size.  The process was painless and the larger size fits great.  I would recommend this product to a friend.
0,I use this in my 1992 accord with 270,000 miles along with all my other vehicles and motorcycles. Don't buy the hype. This is what you need. You don't need a "high mileage" oil.		I once ran it in my oil cooled dr650. I ran the bike up a gnarly trail heating the oil to the point it actually started pushing past the seals. But... The motor did not fail or overheat.		I would not put this in the Prius. The Toyota is prius is a hybrid that uses only ground up puppy farts for lubrication.
0,Super bright! Too bright for a regular DRL
0,Very sturdy construction.  Thank you!
0,k and n now making mercedes filters.
0,It has all the fittings you need. definitely get this at the same time as the tool . . .
0,great buy thanx
0,Product seems to work pretty well, however getting a thorough application is critical to seeing a smooth, even finished product. I found it required a couple passes to get a smooth finish.		The product has an almost citronella like smell to it. Not offensive, but not super pleasant, IMO.		It's not as good as my favorite product for this job which is Adams in and out spray.
0,Great repacement
0,Will buy again!
0,Works as described
0,So, if like me you own a Zetec 2.0 DOHC VCT engine you're gonna want to read this. This is NOT the filter for that engine. It works, but it does not have the "needed" extra anti drain back required to keep oil on the camshafts while off. Don't listen to these geniuses that think it's there to keep oil from spilling on you, they don't care if you spill oil on you. It's there to keep oil on those dual cams and in the VCT gear and solenoid so your car doesn't do the cold start clacking dance. I will say I'm impressed at how durable these cams are since most people are forced to use the wrong filter, most unknowingly.  And to be honest I think the cams are likely to outlast the cars anyway, I've owned zetec engines with 210k+ and unknowingly used the wrong filters, and figured that's how they sound, after 10 mins the noise goes away and doesn't return until after a 10+ hr layover. This is a quality filter and I use them on my Chrysler 3.8 T&C van. However, if you own a Zetec 2.0 DOHC VCT engine look for the right filter FL2005.  This is the hard part, because apparently they were discontinued around 2008? And if you look hard enough you can find them, when you do, buy as many as you can afford based on what you think your needs will be. I've also heard there is a Purolator filter out there that was identical to the FL2005, and that Purolator was actually the manufacturer of the original. But it was also discontinued. Anyway I hope this helps someone. It was a very confusing research project for me. BUT, it solved that annoying, if not damaging cold start clack/tick/knock issues. Also paired with a nice Pennzoil Ultra Platinum 5w-20 synthetic.
0,EXCELLENT...!
0,Took a little while to install these, mostly getting the old fasteners out.  They fit perfectly and help keep mud & rock dings off the car.
0,Easy to install and provides a bright light for tail light on my trailer. I purchased a set of these more than 10 years ago for my boat trailer and they are still working
0,Great product.
0,Works as advertised!
0,Damn these are getting hard to find.  The OBD II is taking over, I like this because it keeps me from having to do the old stripped piece of wire, or paperclip trick when I want to check codes.  It's also pretty cheap and comes with it's own code interpretation book.
0,These are simple and very low cost.  They work , are simple to install and help my daughter get in.  I can see no need to buy the  high price units.
0,Works as advertised.
0,Fits and works great on my truck
0,Great Heavy duty box. this thing is tough. My father has the older version of this one and its been beat and used to the max for the last 14 years. still works perfect. Tough box. will have it for 20 years plus.
0,this chock seems to be properly designed for chocking trailer wheels.  it has cross pieces that grip the groun and the tire.  this should prevent movement.  it is also very sturdy for plastic nad has a great price
0,Nice and bright
0,This is a very nice GPS.  Easy to use.  Just tell it where you want to go.  Order from Amazon.  This is a great purchase!
0,Their products just work.
0,This is a great jump box! I've used it to start vehicles and my phone I've considered buying another one so I can have one at home and at work!! Don't buy the "frequently purchased together" cover and cord though because you will end up with 2 of each cause this jump box comes with each one!!
0,Does what it's supposed to.
0,Good quality, good price, easy install, adds value.
0,This did not fix my problem, but did not cause any other issues.  Installation was straight-forward.  My issue ended up being the low-pressure switch's o-ring and the Schrader valve near it was leaking.  If you're doing your own A/C troubleshooting, I highly recommend checking and/or replacing these items as they are cheap and easy when compared to replacing an entire A/C unit.
0,Cord is too short but when you buy suggested red cord its ok. Light is great product for price!
0,Worked great!
0,VERY GOOD QUALITY. DOES NOT LOOK CHEAP. WELL SEALED. I NEVER USED THEM , BUT APPEARANCE AND WEIGHT MAKES THEM LOOK EXCELLENT.
0,Im pretty sure it works good on my 08 altima , the only problem is i forgot to install it
0,I installed this PS pump on my 323i 2000. I changed out all the hoses and the reservoir. I was dismayed when at first it did not work... then improved slightly but reverted back to no power after only a few miles drive. No leaks and no loss of fluid... I saw no fluid movement in reservoir. Next morning I struggled to turn wheel from extreme right to extreme left while parked. Brakes applied and accelerating engine about 5000 rpm. Within first complete cycle of turning the wheel I had power steering.	Only thought was a vacuum in the pump impeller that passed out of the system. So far all good.		The best part was the service I got from Amazon and the product customer service people.  The CS people won me as a customer.  I will check Evan-Fischer for products in the future and in fact I've already ordered a fan clutch.
0,Easy installation, perfect fit, looks great.  2013 Ram standard cab.
0,Perfect Tool! Not much else to say!
0,i love the look of it ..thank you it was great buying experience
0,Made all the difference in the world in the performance of my daughter's brakes.  I really like raybestos products.
0,fit perfect good product
0,Fit my F150 perfectly
0,Great price.  instructions were easy to follow and worked!  Great deal.  Love it.
0,Well made product and very easy to use with the hose attachment. On my motorcycle it's almost impossible to use a standard air pressure gauge, so this is very helpful.
0,Great stuff
0,Great product worked really well would buy again
0,saves a lot of time and is very convenient!
0,I had the older husky model in a truck I recently sold . The newer ones are even better. Since I'm in gravel a lot, I like the grooves in the liners that catch sand, and small pebbles. They look sharp.
0,This seems to be the easiest one to read and it articulates so I can position it anyway I want.
0,5 min. Install ....works good ...the spring keeps the gas cap cover from rattling ..
0,The surge guard was used for the first time on a two month trip throughout The southwest and seemed to work well but we did not experience any faulty power supplies.  The unit is larger than I expected and did not fit all of the power boxes without laying on the ground.
0,great love it
0,Excellent product and price.
0,Works great. Great buy
0,i have a 2001 Chevy Silverado and these fit my bed pockets very nicely. you will need a #3 philip's screwdriver to install them. i recommend using them on a trial load and then re-tightening them as one moved on me. all in all i don't know why i didn't buy these years ago.
0,Looks perfect. Came with bulbs. Easy installation. Broke my drivers side a few months later so I bought another one of these. Could not be more pleased.
0,Works very well.  Just as bright if not brighter than the H4 bulbs it replaced.  These were used on a snowmobile so results may very for different vehicles.
0,Fantastic factory part or better! Made in Japan. Perfect and economical. Half the price of buying wholesale from Honda.
0,just what I wanted
0,Fit really snug had to adjust the clips to ensure it was secure. overall fit for a 2001 Tundra was good.
0,It's a drawer, what do you say.
0,Great for install, I could not really use for removal.  My ending was too close to the wheel well to use this for removal.  When I tried to move the tool around the pulley it got in a bind with the wheel well.  Installation went well enough though.
0,Excellent
0,works well so far, attachment point is kind of huge but it does not affect performance of this product. Considering the price I paid it was well worth it.
0,I was able to turn a long job into a short 1 by pinching off the hoses. These clamps are very simple to install and remove. Excellent design. I couldn't be happier.
0,Easy to mount!
0,Great item lot of friends buying looks almost like Harley Rain Gear
0,It fit my 2013 Altima SL 4 cyl Sedan perfectly fine.
0,This is a great Idea for riding lawn mowers and ATV. Match this up with Battery Tender Plus 021-0128, 1.25 Amp Battery made charging equipment a lot easier.
0,Good fit. Look nice. No fasteners included.
0,Lights were as described, packaged well and worked perfectly.  Package arrived earlier than expected which was great.
0,Works great to cover the ball
0,This product is great! Very easy to install with great quality. Be careful however because they look very similar earodynamicly, but one end is designed to go on the upper part.  But this is so easy to install.  I am very impress!
0,works perfectly so far
0,Good price for a power mirror.  Works great with a  simple install process that plugs together to connect the power.
0,Good
0,All good most gals don't like the smell but most guys do what else can you say about tree's
0,Worked on repairing some plastics for me. Still going 6 months later.

0,Was as advertised
0,This adhesive works wonderfully.  I will not be without it from now on.
0,Nice seal.  Worked perfectly.
0,no problems
0,great
0,I bought these covers after deciding to run a safari top year round. I wanted something that would protect the seats from rain/mud, and these have worked great. Perfect fit with out any sagging, and they are pretty easy to clean off.
0,Very easy to put together, helped make my wiring for my LED bars look very professional and clean.
0,Real deal. Reputable manufacturer.
0,their a great value heavy duty magnets are included unlike others i'v tried that use magnets that won't hold and you lose the unit on the road have told my company about them and showen the the units and their going to order 30 pairs
0,worked well installed easily
0,So far, so good on this liitle compressor.  This one is in my backup vehicle, an SUV.  The only negative is it is a bit noisey.
0,As an ASE Master Certified Automobile Technician, I only use synthetic motor oils in my vehicles. My "daily driver" is 15 years old, has close to 200,000 miles on the clock and is still reliable and trouble-free. I've used nothing but Mobile-1 Synthetic motor oil for every oil change since I bought it. This is a decent price for a case of 6 quarts
0,Nice tire cover. Better quality than I expected for the money. Really dresses up the old spare tire.
0,Fast Shipping and great product.
0,These are the best filters I have used.  It is very helpful to be able to use a wrench to remove the filter.
0,this pad works great with Meguiar's polish to help bring out a nice deep shine. I had my polisher set to around 1.5k. This does fit a 6in polisher.
0,Good
0,I removed plasti-dip from my car with this and it worked great without damaging the paint. I will order a few bottle to keep around
0,Great quality.
0,It worked on our boat trailer; happy with this purchase.
0,This is a piece I would usually not change as part of my maintenance routine but after a noticeable improvement from replacing the belt tensioner I figured why not. It fit my truck perfectly and along with the new tensioner my Tahoe now idles smooth as silk. Well worth the investment...
0,well worth doing this install rather than letting the unit fail on the truck...The complete unit is PRICEY. very easy to install as well
0,Fit my 07 Subaru WRX with only minor trimming of bumper skin (per directions from Curt) in one small area on the bottom of bumper skin.  Very pleased, fit was perfect and a quality built product.  It took about 90 minutes to install, overall easy to install.  Looks great on the car and does not hang down to low, tucked up nicely and mostly hidden. Love Curt products ! ! !
0,OEM, fit perfectly, works well, easy to install. Very satisfied with purchase. Decent price, also.
0,WELL DONE PARTSAM FAST DELIVERY ANOTHER MASTERPIECE JUST CHECK OUT MY PHOTOS ON MY MUSTANG V8 NOW MY LED'S ARE EPIC INDEED JUST SAYING  ;-)
0,These indicator lights seem like very high quality compared to some others that get shipped across the pacific. They have a nice little "O" ring at the top flange to ensure a nice tight fit and a generous length of wire so you can usually reach it's power source without much pain. The securing nut is a thumb screw that seems to work okay but I'd prefer if it was a hex nut that you could hand tighten with a bare socket. The brightness seems about right and against a black background you can hardly tell they are there until there powered on.
0,Excellent filters.  Will buy again and again.
0,Nice item and it will come in handy in my new car.  I got to wonder why they used a white strap.  The interior of my car is black, the bag is black, but the white strap stands out against the dark seat and looks out of place. I will try to find a black strap to replace it.  The price was great and the bag appears to be quality made..
0,Fit good , not in the way or line of vision, they are very handy.
0,Fit like a charm would recommend
0,Very good product
0,easy to install--have not had big load in van yet but stiffens rear susp- good product
0,I bought these to add accessories to my truck.  They fit snug and secure in the fuse box.  They only seemed to work in certain orientations, but I don't know if that's the fault of this product or the device I was connecting it to.
0,This was a replacement filter for my 2007 Ford Expedition EL LTD (5.4 V8).	The filter is exact fit replacement for the OEM engine intake air filter.
0,Super easy to install on my LS1 Trans Am. I'm thoroughly enjoying 2nd gear now
0,Works well. Good price.
0,Came rely great product
0,xlnt sale
0,I have to rate this a 5, what else?  it was installed in my vehicle and worked perfectly.  It was received on time, packing was very good and the price was right.  It was everything I had expected.
0,I finally got the right on, I'm well pleased.
0,I gave it a 5 because it fit fine, was easy to cover the moped and I love the way the base has elastic to keep it in place on the wheels along with an attachment strap that goes under the center of the cycle that keeps it from blowing in the wind.  Brakes are completely covered along with the muffler.		It arraived early which was great with the tropical storm coming.  The small bag works great for toting it while out shopping.		I would recommend it to anyone with a small street cycle or moped.
0,Perfect replacement for the ones I got with tha car.
0,I have a vintage travel trailer that leaked. I used this around the edges of the roof trim where I was having water leakage and it worked perfect. it dries rock hard and is way better than bond
0,I've had this on my truck for about a month now. It's sturdy, gets a good connection, and was VERY simple to install on my 2004 Silverado 1500. It's a great solution for a truck that didn't come stock with a tow package. And great price for the quality and quantity of how much I use it! Great product!
0,Works Great
0,Used for assembly of snow blower gear case reassembly after gear install after it snapped in two possibly from have a bolt instead of shear pin.
0,These fit my wife's 1999 Honda Civic EX perfect. I just drove the old ones out with a punch and knocked the new ones in. No more clunk over bumps in the rear end.
0,Have used the foam cannon once, it works great.  Certainly puts out a ton of foam on the truck.
0,I don't know what people are talking about with the charger getting hot mine stays cool anyways, I love this charger it's simple, easy to tell if fully charged, it doesn't charge too fast, which is perfect since faster chargers lead the battery to not last as long, and also that it refreshes the battery if discharged for too long I'd recommend this charger for any battery
0,Has not come of the back of my bike in a year now. Has held up tp pretty much everything I have put it thru including leaving it open (empty thank god!) in the rain. Dried it out and that was all. Still looks new. Went to Bike meet the other day and noticed almost 90% of the BMW's and Ducati's had the same bag on them ( dozens )
0,Great for my 87 yj.
0,Works great, looks good.
0,MAXMADE listens. Some people were insecure about the safety of the previous car jump starter and those problems of safety have been addressed and corrected. The circuit protection is enhanced with better molding structure and over-voltage protection, over-charge protection as well as over-temperature protection. And they've added countercurrent protection on the cables themselves. This starter does not heat up to the hand the way the first stage one often did. But first things first.		MAXMADE supplies this very adaptable charger in a fine little case that includes the charging cable for jump starting the car, a car adapter for the cigarette lighter that can be used to charge the Starter when not in use (though a charged starter will perform its function 15 times on one charge!), a USB cable for charging phones and tablets and other devices when not using the device to jump start the car (there are two ports on the charger - a 5V-2A and a 5V 1A), and LED flashlight to aid your night time placing the charger on your car's battery, and LED lights that indicate the battery charge level.		Charging this device outside the car is possible via an AC adapter in your home, and this adapter is also supplied with the device. This little kit in its handsome case is ready for any emergency on the road, to GET on the road, and for other devices. MAXMADE seems to have thought of everything this time! Grady Harp, November 14
0,Easy to install and looks great.  It does leak in a few places but I assume it's because I didn't clean the surface well enough.
0,If you want a product that has been around for yrs and yrs then buy this.  It will work good and cost less than others.
0,People will know that you like dragonflys if you sport this on your ride. I got it for my mom, and now she feels special. I should have been a better son growing up.
0,A great mounting Platform
0,I can't say enough good things about these. Very bright.
0,everything I have purchased from Griot's has met or exceeded my expectations
0,Looks great! Actual metal, too (not plastic)
0,Perfect as advertised. Allows small amounts of oil, dye, etc.. to be added to your refrigerant, or large amounts for that matter. A single ounce of oil gave noticeable results to my system on one of my older "keeper" vehicles.
0,replaced OEM charger on 2005 Airstream which was killing batteries. Replaced 2-12v RV/Marine worthless batteries with 2-6v t-105 trojans and this charger. The powerMax is same as BoonDocker brand and a 3 stage converter/ charger. It a bit smaller than what was is in the RV but not by a lot.		Was easy to install and works great.
0,Great value for the money. It fits my Subaru Forest with little gaps around the mirror,  but that is not a deal breaker. Inside of the car is noticeably coller.  Can be tricky to fold it back to the bag, but it just matter of practice.  Easy to store under the seat. I hope it will last. I would recommend it to a friend.
0,Installation was simple. I love the low profile design. My Escalade looks like it came from the factory with these on it stock.
0,Great front floor mats.
0,Work great
0,Nice fit
0,Good job again Zymol!
0,The great nice finish I think the hardware will rust out before the running board ever has any issues
0,I love the gripping power and attachment options with different teeth
0,Well built, looks oem, and it works.
0,Just as described
0,You want to talk about a company that has focused on quality and customer satasificarion in a day and age where no one cares Jaco seems to have picked up that lost art.
0,Easy install, fits and looks great on my 2001 F250
0,I am a little skeptical as how this will hold up in the elements.  I am using it under the vehicle (bolted into place) but the shield seems like it could be absorbent (through the ends of shield).  I like the way it flexes and fits where I want it, but I wish the ends were more sealed up.  Overall, for the money, it was worth a shot for me to try them out.
0,Awesome
0,I've broke beads on several different tires (trailer, F-150, swather).  Smart design. I've got a few people looking to borrow it already. ha ha
0,Fit my Ultra Classic perfect.
0,I used these to replace the Bosch Icons on my Wife's car (it was older and we were getting rid of it fairly soon).  They worked just about as well as the Icons and were much cheaper!  The all season aspect is pretty good.  We live in Illinois and the winters are pretty harsh with a lot of ice buildup.  They worked well in the summer and winter until we got rid of the car.  I would highly recommend those for just about any car in any weather changing environment.  I can't attest to hot and dry weather conditions as we do not live in them.  They work really well for everything we have put them through.
0,This fit the 2014 Toyota Tundra...replacement for the OEM extra long antenna...I can still pickup all the HD stations with this antenna. I am storing the OEM in the truck as a backup.
0,good product for a good price, they do what they are supposed to do, plain and simple.
0,Waiting to use this after a year of filter being used
0,Good offer for the special fluid.  [...]
0,Great product excellent seller thank you
0,All good excellent seller and product
0,ok
0,Fits a wide-bodied heavyweight just fine.  Can't believe I used the antique with the steel wheels for all those years.  This thing gets you low and rolls really well.  Doesn't tip up when you're getting off of it either.		The head pad sure beats sticking the roll of paper towels under my head like I used to.
0,Fixed My 2007 Tahoe Cruise Control failure in 5 minutes !  How nice..;)
0,Perfect for the LS swap, this is takes about a 1/2 hose, be aware
0,Haven't mounted them yet but they look to be of good quality. Just what I needed for my 1965  Classic Corvair convertible.
0,Great quality.......no fittings. You will need your own fittings.
0,good
0,Exactly what my Pontiac Grand Prix needed for a smoother ride.
0,worked great
0,better than wasting a lot of liquid on the floor.
0,Holds sudz well.. works perfect
0,I got REALLY tired of my worn out brake pedal cover coming off.  Found this one and about 10 seconds after it came in, it was on!  Looks perfect and hasn't budged one bit!  Excellent.
0,Quality as expected from Auto 7.
0,Worked as advertised.
0,The traffic feature seems to only work in very large cities, but the display is very nice on this. Easy to use and has a better touch screen than my last Garmin.
0,The national camping store retailer had me convinced I needed a new light assembly if I wanted LED lighting in my travel trailer.  This was a low cost alternative with great results.  These lights provide a white daylight type light.
0,easier than a pickle fork...I used the puller to push out some ball joints on my 96 civic.  Worked great.
0,These things work great. The no drill portion is really an excellent feature. Bought these for a 2015 Sierra Crew Cab shortly after rolling off the lot. Most of the other products required drilling into the brand new truck, found these and went for it. The dealer wanted nearly $400 to install their models, got these purchased and installed myself for under $80. Great product. Protect my investment just that much more.		I will say that the pictures worried me. They have a really odd looking bulbous portion directly under where they mount. This does exist on the product, but it is not nearly as pronounced as the picture would lead you to believe. Looks pretty good.
0,This frame is classic! Give my car a great look!
0,Bought for my 98 civic. Fits perfect.
0,Good stuff, works great
0,It was correct fit for my 2013 Toyota Corolla, and sufficient length for all four doors.
0,Excellent product!
0,Fits
0,These vent visors are easy to install, however, make sure that you know exactly where you want to put these visors. Once you take off the tape covering and you stick it on the car, there is no taking it back.  Visor comes with small alcohol squares to use to clean the surface where you plan to mount the visors. Since the visors are made to fit over hatch windows, make sure you place the correct ones over the left and right windows. The narrow end of the visor goes toward the front of the window. If you place it on the back, you will not be able to open the rear windows. The visors will look great on your truck. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants to add some style and personalize their truck.
0,Worked great and good price.
0,Not much to say. leaps and bounds above a stock headlight. Bright and clear with a great pattern. I run them on all my vehicles.
0,The best stuff.  Makes black engine and other parts look new, assuming they are clean.  Have been using for over 15 yrs.
0,Yes
0,A few days after installing this decal on my rear window, the clear portion started peeling away.  When I tried to remove it all the white lettering remained secure to the glass... Only then did I realize that it was a perfect installation!!  Very clean on the window!!
0,Purchased for a project because it was cheaper than a blank sheet of rubber of equal size.	This is a seriously heavy flap! Nearly 3/8 thick and fiber reinforced so even if it was cut or cracked during use it would not tear.
0,I this kit a 5 for it works great easy installation easy to program. It corrected the speedo, restored the correct shift points back. Added bonus my mpgs went back up 2 mpg, my truck is a 2012 tundra  DC 8 foot bed 3 in lift and 35 in mudders.
0,works great
0,Fits my 2003 Avalon. Dropping the glove box was easy after watching a youtube video. Takes about 15-20 minutes total.
0,I was a little skeptical about ordering these headlights, however when I received them, installation was a piece of cake. These headlights really make a difference if your current ones are hazy or damaged. I support Depo brand a 100%.
0,Just what I wanted  I did have to drill one hole in the right peg to aline the spring. It was nothing. Great product.
0,yep
0,It was very nice and fit as it should.  Didn't use it long term though.
0,With M105 I was able to get the scratches out of my paint from years of hand washing my car (incorrectly).
0,Bought with a 5-quart jug of Mobil 1 5W-30 oil because we got a rebate when we bought both. It was a really great purchase and I think they a rebate every now and then, so you can definitely save a few dollars if you're willing to stock up in advance!
0,As advertised
0,These things tend to make you use much more tire gel than necessary because they soak up so much product. I've discovered that they don't work especially well for sidewalls that have a lot of texture molded onto them, such as on my OEM Goodyear Assurance tires. I'm likely to not reorder these applicators when they are worn out, which likely won't take too long on these tires. In all fairness, I think these applicators will work VERY well for smooth sidewalls, and especially on larger tire sizes. They have plenty of surface area to work well on tires with high aspect ratios, but are too large for 45-series aspect ratios or less, in my opinion.
0,I live in Washington State, near Seattle, and ride a motorcycle year-round!  I got these gloves fairly recently, and have loved having them!  Even in September rain, my four-five minute commute is warm and dry!  I get to work with my hands still dry, and unless it is super cold (like snowy cold), they are still warm!
0,These things are so great, with extra visibility out the rear of your vehicle they should be installed from the factory!!!	We are really glad we made this purchase for our three vehicle's.	Thank you for their availability with Amazon!!!!!
0,Easy to install, only needs one wrench.
0,the best oil for your money and motors
0,Easy installation great fit
0,I ordered this to replace a conventional lead-acid battery on my 1981 Harley Superglide. The battery arrived dry and was a good fit. You will have to install battery acid with the included acid-bottle fill system. When you are done, you will then have a maintenance free battery. First, remove the cap strip that covers the holes on the battery. Then place the battery on a level surface. Next, remove the plastic strip that covers the holes on the acid bottle. Don't worry, the acid bottle holes are still sealed by foil membranes under the strip. Keep this strip and do not remove the foil membranes. Tilt the bottle up over the battery fill holes. Now force the bottle straight down into the holes. The membranes will be pierced by sharpened nipples inside of the holes. The acid will then flow uniformly into the battery. Leave the bottle and battery alone for a few minutes. The bottle will empty and a perfect quantity of acid is now installed into each cell. Next, remove the bottle and install the cover strip that was initially removed from the bottle onto the battery. My battery had enough charge to run the starter but I trickle charged it to top it off. Finally, start the hawg and then ride it like you stole it!
0,Fine enough for the vehicle that I sold.
0,works fine
0,amazing product if you're knowledgeable of how to use it.
0,perfect fit for 2003 Silverado
0,Amazing car organizer! I travel A LOT with work and always need a notepad handy or hand out for clients; this holds it all--plus an extra water bottle. It is great since I can keep all my stuff at arm's reach from the driver's seat and if I need to carry a passenger I can just spin it around out of the way. I have had it about a year and still is in great shape. Quality product!
0,High quality looks great!
0,good
0,I have a 2014 Kia Sorento with third row. This product fits perfect over the third row/cargo area. The only down side is you have to take it out and store it away when using your third row. The Kia dealer makes a cargo tray that allows you to use your third row without having to remove it and store it away. I have both, and use the weather tech one when going camping know a head of time that I'm going to make a mess in my cargo area. I have been buying weather tech products since 2007 and have never been disappointed with them. They have Great customer services.
0,Its from InstallGear! Buy it ,install it, and never mess with it again. If you haven't used or seen the quality of their products your using the wrong stuff!
0,Well made product from CURT.  Perfect mount for my Reese 74309 interchangeable ball kit.  Using my CURT 21510 coated hitch pin this Class III mount fits snugly into my CURT 3534 Class III receiver hitch.
0,works great
0,Easily lock your hitch keep it secure and water resistant looks nice
0,Very nice behavior !!!!
0,This is a Fram Ultra XG7317 with 24,362 miles using 3- OCI's of early 2015 vintage PYB 5w-20 conventional motor oil.	From a 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport AWD 2L CVT with no makeup oil through the process. Most driving is highway-rural.	I ran this one out as my old 10K OCI's were showing I was throwing out perfectly good filters.	This is overkill but shows you even with conventional oil these are the best filters on the market.
0,very good quality !!! Great price
0,This little tool works great! My husband added 4 pin trailer light setup to his new pickup truck. His trailer is not stored at the house so we used this gadget to check out the wiring. It couldn't be any more foolproof to use. The little LED's are easy to read and understand what you are looking at. Highly recommend this little thing.
0,love it
0,I use this to touch up rock damage to the front of my 2014 Corvette. Great paint, it is very difficult to find the spots that I have painted.
0,This heater worked well this winter in -60F temps and allowed much easier starts with out the metal to metal squealing. It comes with a nice install kit as a bonus.
0,Great stuff, I use for clay bar lubrication, wet sanding and detail touch ups.
0,Bought this for my husbands classic truck. Fits well, although because the truck is classic we did have use some clips/snaps to get it a little tighter. Not a product issue though. This is a good buy, very durable and thick, and protects perfectly!
0,Installed them on my trucks toolboxes with no issues. Keeps the water out. Make sure you buy the right ones as far as the compression goes or it may no work well.
0,Looks great on my JK. Installation was clicking these two things into the bessels around the lights... So if you have hands, you have the right tools. Not sure why there are other reviews pissing and moaning about a gap between the light and light accent. I had them painted to match the rhino lined grill, looks perfect, I'll post pics
0,After dropping the air dam on the Jeep installation was easy. Unlike other companies who say that their product will fit this went in with no problems. A very bright white/blue light with no temperature problems against the stock lens. If you are looking for a bulb to light the trails with your headlights then go for it!
0,Purchased for my husband's hobby.  No complaints from him
0,Perfect fit for my 1999 silverado 5.3 liter with Z71 suspension. Ride quality has been restored.
0,Best price, shipped fast and is way more than I expected. LED's can be really deceiving as adverized but this light will blind you. I plan to get another. Excellent product which would have cost me double ay the local off road store.		I have had the light on my off road cart now for nearly a year.  It is still a best buy and has amazing power with very little draw on the electrical system.
0,These are very well-built, robust fuseholders.  Heavy-duty, large-gauge wiring, and clips that grasp the fuse tightly, so no over-heating with high-current applications.
0,Doesn't work on the truck and pulley I bought it for but is very well made. I'm going to keep it because with my luck I'll get rid of it and some other vehicle pulley will pop up that I'll need it for. If you're trying to remove a 04-05 F150 5.4 triton harmonic damper you will need the 3 bolt style puller no matter what the forums say. My friends 08 didn't have the bolts holes for his so that one took a traditional 3 jaw puller.
0,Excellent	Was the arrival of the consignment deadline	Experience of the product is fantastic
0,Worked perfectly. Easy to install. Saved a bunch over Camping World. Only the thermostat was bad, but glad I changed the ECO as well.  TOtal time: 45 minutes.
0,first time i bought a cargo net but i am happy i did.this thing can stretch and attach to anything.
0,Fits great and looks great.
0,Great buy for the cost. High quality shocks! Very happy with this product. Fast shipping.
0,My bowl movements have never been better since taking an ounce a day of this juice.
0,Works well on my 2010 Xterra. Sometimes I feel like I need to be a little closer than the original, but it works just fine. Take your time and follow the instructions closely.
0,Great for holding my motorcycle down
0,Awesome, works like a charm.....
0,works great!
0,As good as described.
0,Great cable and good software included.  it also works with Forscan software for ford specific sub systems.
0,Been wanting one of these to check and make sure my hook up on my truck works.
0,Love this keychain, held up so far and people wonder where I got it from. couldn't be happier with this
0,Made a nice difference  to my wheels
0,Great light bar. Fits pretty well for my wrangler.
0,Perfect fit for my Tacoma
0,Worked on my 2000 BMW 528i
0,Now , I bought this because my 5 yo daughter likes talking about transformer cars and trucks..There are quite a few around with these emblems on them in our area..Broward Co Fla..Yeah, she see's one and I play it up..like "Oh , look ! An Autobot!"..She wasn't that impressed with it on our car though..
0,Read the title, that is what this is.  Like my existing RhinoFLEX 15' setup, this collapses down to a small size.  I have not used it in anger yet, but sleep better knowing I have extended range on my little hose of misery.
0,Works great, I tried soap and other products then ordered this. It made my tire install easy as it could be. I was amazed how easy this made the job. This is a must have when working with tires.
0,IT WORKS FINE..LASTS ABOUT A YEAR IN FL. BUT WORKS FINE
0,Sturdy, need I say more. Will not work unless you have a square or rectangular frame. Versutle set up. 5 bolt rim fit perfectly.
0,This decal was perfect!  It came in an envelope, with cardboard protection on both sides to ensure it did not get damaged during shipment.	Once I received it, I ensured that the glass on my vehicle was clean and, following the directions, I installed it.	I've had it a couple of months on my vehicle, and it is still looking as good as the first day.  No summer heat yet, but it has put up nicely through a mild-ish north-east winter.  We'll see how it survives through the summer heat and humidity.
0,Fantastic, very easy to install and look good.
0,The whizzy wheel works awesome. A great product for minimal cost.
0,Not quite 2 years old, they are showing signs of excesive rust. I don't expect they will last another 3 years.  I did put another coat of primer on before the install.	Installed on 06 F350 dually,
0,Champion spark plugs always work as advertised
0,FAST shipping! The terminals are 1/4" wide not the 1/8" needed for the ELK alarm panel. It was quick work with a hand file to narrow the width in place it in service. The previous battery suffered a shorted cell in 18 months. The clock is running...
0,Saved us this past weekend at the campsite.  This shut down the power because of low voltage at the campground and resumed it when back in range.  Glad to see it worked well.
0,So much better than my original shocks on the door.  The door now stays all they way open....
0,Perfect oil match for my indmar 340 engine in my '05 Malibu Wakesetter.
0,A+ 5 Stars Perfect!
0,Worked very well, great price and fast shipping!  Thanks for a great trouble free deal!!!
0,This works much better than ArmorAll or Meguiars interior protectant. Even after a month of use, the dash board still have a film of protection. Unlock Meguiar's, this protectant will not cause glare due to the dashboard being too shiny.
0,nice
0,I have a camaro ss 2014 and I put a splitter on it and it barely made it, but it made it and that's all I care. So far looks and works great.
0,installed very simply in very little time  didn't even have to unhitch exhaust like instructions said
0,I purchase this item in 2007, it was so perfect I could not stop myself from buying it again at this price. Outstanding.
0,These are great for marker lights.  Not such a good fit for the license plate lights on my '07 Sierra. I put them in the cargo/third brake  light. Look great!

0,Great upgrade to replace weak factory plastic connections
0,Plugs my hole! Perfect!
0,Works good really bright for driving lights
0,For a 2012 Rubicon with hard top removed and no soft top hardware, this cover fits perfectly. Haven't had a chance to test it in rain. Will update review if that changes things.
0,Great product and happy that they sell this in a multi pack. Its very easy to lose the foam cover with a lot of usage.
0,Very good
0,Before buying, be aware that these are made specifically for the old Trico/Anco wiper frames that came original on older cars (classics and vintage). These don't fit in newer types of wiper frames. I bought these for my Trico stainless 18" frames and they fit perfectly, which is expected because these are original equipment refills for old style wipers. If your wipers don't look like any of these, with these thin rail guides (see pics) then don't buy these!
0,Work great.  Install was actually pretty simple.  Great price.
0,Great, no complaints
0,Good price for these pants. I'm 5'9'' and 185lbs. Pants are a few inches too long, but can be cinched up with the velcro staps at the cuff. i've been satisfied with a jacket made of this material and am glad to have gotten pants to complete my foul weather gear.
0,This shade fits my 05 Mazda 3 perfectly. It's constructed very well and has a nice long strap to keep it rolled up easily. Keeps my car cooler than the old style shade I used to use.
0,Works good as expected.	And for the ignorant "anti 2nd Amndmnt": blame the person, not the g u n.
0,Works as intended.
0,Fantastic very thick plastic very strong will buy more
0,Great just as described
0,These get warm, actually quite hot. Finally got the opportunity to try this out on a recent moose hunt up here in Alaska. Warm up fast and get hot enough to be uncomfortable. I found that starting the wheeler with them on "high" but switching them to "low" after a couple mins worked the best for me. I can't imagine how hot they'd be on bare skin (we had gloves of varying thickness on every time on the wheelers) and even with my thickest gloves they'd still be too hot on high.
0,Built heavy duty, works like a Cadillac. Smooth no problems.  Checked all ends. No where is the insulation uncovered or exposed. HD built outlet, HD but easily squeezed hand grips.
0,I purchased these shocks for my G6. They were an easy install. Gave my car it's ride quality back! I love them.
0,worked well easy to work
0,This is the factory Filter and much better price than local dealer! Will get be getting another one down the road.
0,very good
0,Worked great!
0,The product has a Velcro closure which appears to be sturdy. The shell of the product is a soft material which attracts lint. Overall this productive provides greater shoulder belt comfort for occupants of the vehicle. This would have received a 5 star rating had the product had an outer shell which was harder and resisted lint and other debris.
0,What can I say It Fits and Works!!
0,Fast shipping and it installed and works perfectly!
0,Used in my 2014 Mazda 3 Hatch 2.5L S Grand Tour. Worked like a treat!
0,So far very pleased. Accurate and repeat-accurate readings. Won't go back to the cheap gauges again.
0,Don't own a 6.0 Powerstroke without having a coolant filter, and the baldwin brand is under all my trucks (11 of them)
0,My application was an 05 Harley FLHTC. I used the Amazon ask a question on the need for an adaptor. After several good replies I went with using some tin snips and cut back the OEM bucket. Took about 5 min. After that it was a direct plug in with no need for the enclosed adaptors. Appears to be much brighter than the original. Coupled with the 4.5" matching spot lights it should helpful both day and night.
0,Fits good and looks like it belongs there.
0,Perfect product,perfect fit,Love the lights
0,Works great. Would definitely buy again when I need another
0,Item fit perfectly
0,Put this on my 2004 f250 and also have the same part on my 99 f350 and my 03 f250. Always quality and built better than OEM. all of my trucks have moog ball joints and steering linkage. Perfect fit and best price on amazon.
0,Perfect fit, arrived really quick.
0,Ran great
0,These blades work fine and since they cost a fraction of the OEM blades or some of the new tech blades, you can afford to replace them more often which is just a good idea anyway.  They may be a bit noisier in certain situations, but not enough to make them unpleasant or annoying.  And the condition of your windshield will also play a large part in the sound they make (or not make).
0,Nice top quality spare tire cover.
0,Great to replace the old ones
0,I own a black vehile and this device reduces the amount of grit and grime that is collected on the cloth when washing
0,I replaced the eight year old shocks on my F250. It had about 75,000 miles on it. I can tell no difference between these shocks and the old ones that were on the truck. If I was to do this again, I would just buy the cheap factory replacements.
0,Perfect fit.
0,this is a great fuel cap.  we bought it since my husband parks at the rapid station in a big city and people are known for stealing fuel.  With this they can not, just have some lock deicer since the lock will freeze in the winter.
0,good
0,This socket fits the camper jack perfectly and the squared tip holds well in the rechargable drill used to power it.  Sure beats using a hand crank to raise/lower the jack stand.
0,Fits my 2006 Dodge Ram 3500 5.9 cummins
0,Well, since our employee didn't see this on the tire, and moved the machine, and then it got wrecked this was a GREAT replacement, and we are very happy with this.
0,Fit as expect
0,Great product and very bright!  Very easy to wire  if you know electronics.
0,Im upgrading from t10 leds and even from already having leds this is a massive difference although the housings didn't fit perfectly you can make it work and they are alot brighter i juat installed them about 5 min ago at 7:30 so i don't have any bight time shots but with how bright these are you don't need to see them at night in the picture the t10 led is on the left and this new led and housing is on the right i am impressed also the white thing thqt goes on the old housing does not fit on this housing
0,GREAT QUALITY!!! AUTHENTIC TOO!
0,Good running boards for the money!	Easy install, All Hardware included and labeled for install.
0,No complaints!  ty!
0,works like it should!
0,better than my plastic one but the fit was just a little off
0,Looks Great on my car, and I didn't put them on myself but they were installed really fast and it gives the car a nice finishing touch.
0,excellent product
0,This fit my Jeep Cherokee perfect!
0,very nice
0,OK
0,Had it programmed with my Buick and it worked better than the original.
0,Fits perfect well made
0,I bought this pulley to replace my worn out one while replacing tensioner. It works great.
0,fit perfect and clear the windshield just like the expensive ones do
0,WORKS AS EXPECTED, BETTER QUALITY THAN STANDARD FRAM FILTER. INSTALLED ON 2001 F-150 WITH 300,000 MILES AND A 5.4L TRITON ENGINE.
0,Works much better with my screw jacks than the one they came with.
0,Works, got it cut, did the self-programming as the seller's site described, started my 2006 GTP.  Just be advised there's no logo on the key, just a blank circle.
0,The fit and finish of these lug nuts are excellent. Used them to replace lug nuts on a 2007 Honda CR-V.
0,ok
0,Excellent replacement for air handler interior insulation. All you need is spray on glue for installation.
0,some modifications and this is required for your double din instillation. cheep enough and does the job would recommend you get it, looks good in the truck to.
0,One of the most functional things I have ever owned !!!! I use it for my truck, 5th wheel trailer and slide outs, I even do my neighbors cars because it works so well.... I bought 10 more and have given them to a few good friends and family
0,I purchased this to use in my Boat. It seems to be perfect for my use.
0,WHAT A DIFFERENCE FROM THE 150000 MILE SHOCKS I TOOK OFF.
0,great product!
0,Arrived as described, on time, and no problems.
0,Great filter that fits my 2004 New Holland TC40, 2013 Ford Focus, and Bad Boy zero turn mower.
0,Arrived on time, worked as advertised.  Four stars instead of five because of the splicing I had to do in order to get the wire to reach.  Directions or a wiring diagram would have been nice.
0,If it was a manufacturer product, I'd give it 1 star, because I dislike changing these type of filters, but it is what it is and this one fits. 1981 Suzuki gs650 engine.
0,Love it so far. I put a thick line of clear silicone around it due to the f150 issue that is a common problem with water damage.		So far so great had it for about a week. Gives my truck a cool look from behind.
0,A decent drying towel, it is great for a small car, will probably take 2 to dry a mid-size or larger, 3 or more for a large car or truck. I don't like using a chamois but needed something better than a bath towel, this product was what I was looking for.  For detailing enthusiasts, garage queens, and show cars, there are safer and more absorbent options: the Rag Company Dry Me a River, Cobra Guzzler, AutoGeek Big Blue, and the ultimate (and most expensive) Griot's PFM.
0,Nice and bright. Works great in my trunk. Wish it had a yellower light option.
0,convenient shopping , decent price..
0,This probably won't last too long, considering what it is made out of and how cheap it is, but it's doing the job right now in my tractor cab.
0,great
0,Installed and working
0,If half stars were allowed I would rate this 4  stars. I deducted points for the price/value. This stuff isn't a miracle worker but it definitely does work. I used it on my old truck which has been neglected and the paint is in really bad shape. Griots Complete Compound removed some handprints and an oxidized area by my window where my arm hangs out. It also looked brighter and shinier afterwards. I applied it with a microfiber towel and wiped it off with clean ones. It took a little elbow grease but nothing ridiculous. It was certainly easier to deal with than wax. An orbital would have done a much better job but I was impressed with what it did by hand. I would use it again. I applied liberally using probably at least 12 ounces to clean my truck so you do go through a lot of it and its expensive which is why I knocked it a star. However, I imagine with a vehicle thats in better condition you won't go through nearly as much of it.
0,2005 RSX with 115k mi		Started consuming oil -- about 1qt / 3mo around 90k mi, then 1qt / 2wks.  Pulled the trigger and added 1qt Duralube to fill the engine.  It went 2mo w/o using any oil until my next oil change.  I'm very frustrated since I've been only using Royal Purple (~8-9k mi) then Amsoil (~15k mi).  In retrospect, I wouldn't use RP longer than 7.5k mi.  I ran into some knocking & difficulty shifting at the upper end of the mileage.  Amsoil easily goes 1yr.  It's hard to tell if these products help or hurt long term, but so far my experience is good.  I'm just nervous because I love my RSX.  If it turns out I still have a problem (and can't find a way to solve it once & for all), I'll next try Duralube + Amsoil (still trying to reach the dream of 1-annual oil change).
0,Fixed my daughter's first car with this. Worked great, and was easy to do. Hint: Buy a trim puller and take the sound deadener off the hood first. Makes it way way easier.
0,It fits a 2003 Ford Taurus, some other ones advertised as fitting do not work \.
0,These are strong, well designed lug nuts that tighten securely, providing  security for the wheels yet are easily removed with the provided key.
0,actually purchased this for my dad.  He just got the volt, and needed something stronger on the floor. He has told me that they are nothing but perfect. amazing quality, exact fit, great durability, and they look good.
0,My first legitimate use for these cables was to crank over a 500ci Cadillac engine sitting on an engine stand. They were long enough that my truck could sit outside and idle while I engaged the starter from inside my shop. Clamps got warm but the springs are just as strong as they were out of the box. I will always keep a set of these on hand and they are the only cables I recommend to my friends.

It did and I was impressed (I posted a rather shaky video below)  Anyway, my truck battery dies when I leave my bully dog chip on, typically it takes using my battery charger and jumping from my other truck.  So unlike other sites I was not given a discount to purchase the product and then give a review, I purchased it at normal price and actually expected to give a review that this product didn't work.  I was impressed, still have no idea how they can pack that much power in that little battery.
0,Bought a new aluminum trailer for my 17 ft skiff. The first thing to go in salt water is the leaf springs and shackles. I sprayed this corrosion inhibitor all over them with two coats and so far, I haven't see the first spot of rust on them. This is an unusual application, but it appears to work great so far!
0,Great tool
0,All good
0,Takes roughly 3 years to get all the beads in using the tube and turkey baster. I had to shave in between each tire, and it was nice to visit the family. I assume they balance, but I wouldn't know since my ass is so dead from standing there putting these friggin beads in.
0,Nice look, fast shipping. Could be a little larger.
0,This Inclinometer is perfect for my tractor.  The tractor I am referring to is a road tractor, i.e., street legal.  My truck tractor, is an Isuzu NPR and though the indicator depicts a jeep, I have found that to be a minor inconvenience.  The roll shows me how fast I can actually take a curve in this tractor, and the pitch shows how much braking is being done when I rush to a stop.		It is a lighted version, and can be seen quite easily at night too.  I attached it to its own light switch, so my dashboard is separate from the indicator.  For instance at night, if the tractor is parked on a incline, I can turn on the lamp to see the indication at a glance.		With this indicator, I have been able to determine how fast I can take a curve, how much cornering I can muster without tipping over the truck. Of course, you have to collect data on what can and cannot be done and this meter allows you to collect this data for future use.		It's a plus for me.  Mounts on the dash, and looks distinguished when looking at the dashboard on a medium duty truck tractor.  The cost is just right for the information it gives.  The only drawback would be, that you have to mount it on a surface horizontal with the vehicle, since it does not have an adjustment if the mount surface is not level with the vehicle.
0,This took about 5 minutes to replace in my FJ cruiser. My old one had been in there for 75000 miles and a few vacuumings. It managed to get leaves and all sort of other detritus. This is a simple job anyone can do themselves, for a fraction of what the oil place will charge you. Highly recommended.
0,This is the second one i got from amazon, every 2 years i need a more expensive complete tune up to pass CA smog test  and for some reason i trust in this brand, this cap fits a 91 accord and it seems to perform really good
0,Because of my milage, I needed to change my timing belt.  And we all know that if you are taking the time to change your timing belt, you might as well "blow the damn money" and change out the other parts associated to the inexpensive repair of a timing belt.  I so hate timing belts!		The part arrived promptly and has been installed.  I did not verify money saved, but was able to manage how the spending of this job by ordering parts ahead of the repair.
0,fit just right
0,Seller did a good job getting this out to me..	I need this real bad it look and it works very nice too..
0,I was concerned when I received these and seen that they where made in China. I waited to see how they would hold up and so far at least a month or better has past and they have preformed with perfection. There was a problem with a leaky valve cover gasket that was also repaired at the same time. So this should be evaluated when pulling off the old coils for any oil. Otherwise you would be wasting your money with any brand of new coils without repairing the gasket first. My opinion is that these are at a great price and well worth consideration.
0,great light bar looks great
0,The switch came nicely packaged, arrived 2 days before the estimated arrival, and was in perfect, brand new condition.  Not sure about the other reviewer and the tabs, but this unit was exactly like the original, had the tabs and snapped into place with no problems or issues.  All switches worked like a champ!
0,repeat customer would not be with out it makes engines run better if you failed engine emissions test use a treatment	and next test you will pass .
0,Good produced. I love it works perfect in my car. The white light looks a blush. So from distance you will look a cop lol.
0,Fit great on my VP Fuel Can.
0,For the price, great product, just not as bright as some other more expensive led strips.
0,Fairly easy install, works right out of the box. Solid construction and seems like it will last a while! A lot cheaper than the factory power option for my motorcycle.
0,I have all black interior and with this blue led dome light it give it that fun night life feel haha
0,I purchased our three as replacements 4 years ago when we bought our used 5th wheel - just in case as one was damaged when we took delivery and didn't notice. So far, these have worked as hoped, we can leave a vent cracked while the trailer is in the drive or even traveling. As far as tough - pulled one off with a power line while backing into our driveway (a power company problem, since fixed), it dropped 12 feet with no other damage but the bolt holes. Put it back, used new bolts and some fender washers and 2 years later still as good as before the day it came down
0,Gauge seems to be very accurate and the inflator is very easy to use
0,East install and nice all around, however am disappointed that it delete my rear cup holder.
0,After borrowing this item, I had to buy one!  Sure beats trying to find washers/sockets that may work.
0,Does not work in my 2006 Dodge mega cab had to do something different, I installed them exactly as per instructions.
0,Wonderfull i love this model
0,Received damaged...was replaced immediately and am satisfied with product.
0,If you tend to take your off-road vehicle into areas that are particulary dusty or sandy, you'll want this PreCharger for your K&N filter. Of course the filter can be cleaned and re-oiled at any time, but this wrap will keep you from having to do it nearly as often. It will keep the filter around and boosting horsepower that much longer as well.
0,High quality material, and fits like a glove; can't go wrong here.  Perfect protection against children!
0,Just as everyone else stated it has a short cord. I wanted a light for plowing connected to the OEM roof switch. It only flashes on pattern 1 after my modification and cord replacment connecting it to the GM (TRW) Roof Beacon Option I installed. I unsoldered the original cord at the circuit board and replaced it with a 2 wire black lamp cord and a weatherproof connector. The connector is so I can remove the light for getting the vehicle washed. The original cord had 3 wires Red Black and Yellow. Red + Black - and The yellow is what changes the flash pattern. It is very bright and I can now plow snow...
0,Nice bell. Heavier that I expected. Nice finish.
0,I love the BOSCH brand for my BMW 535i.  They work better than any other brand.  They have been on for about 6 months and are still going strong.
0,excellent item
0,I bought this for my battery operated corn feeder. It's held up through 2 years now and has given me no problems. My feeders stay out year round through 100 degrees in the summer to below freezing in the winter.		I have it connected to a solar panel and together I have worry free energy!		Great value on this battery.
0,Love this bumper!  Fits perfectly.  I had put the end caps on before I mounted the bumper.  I think it might have been easier to access the mounting nuts with the end off.  Use of an air ratchet is a plus.  The mounting bolts are on the long side.
0,Glad I ordered. These turned out better than I expected. Need an extra set of hands to install and be sure to buy a few extra self tappers.
0,I buy jdm astar whenever I need LED lights! JDM ASTAR is the bast and brightest!
0,This worked much better than I thought it would. I buff and wax my car by hand, and I had a few scratches that weren't coming out with rubbing compound. I used this, and the scratches are almost invisible.
0,Quick and easy to install.  Took my time and had it done in 20 minutes.  Highly recommend for people that switch tops out.
0,Exactly what I needed to change diff fluid in my 2012 Honda CRV. Worked great
0,Great product at a great price!!
0,good purchase
0,One Word..."WOW"...	Replaced my Toyota 4runner stock horn  (meeep). These, together sound like a train version of the originals. Still a meep, butt on steroids. Defenatly what I was going for. Now that'll get there attention!!
0,worked fine as expected
0,This is a nice filter and I like the nut on the top. It makes for easy changing in tight spots.	K & N seems to go to the extra trouble to make a better filter than other manufacturers.
0,Good product
0,Works well
0,This is one of the best LED bars you can buy. It doesn't have the led's " exposed" like some other bars. It's very simple to install with just a wipe and tape. I've have mine on for a couple months and the tape is still very strong. The best part about this light is the brightness! I've seen a lot of other brands and they are not as bright as the Redline when hitting the brakes. The reverse lights are not as bright as the brake lights but they cast a little brightness. Did I mention it's cheaper than the big names too? Buy this light, you'll be happy you did!
0,Great fit easy to install, fast shipping and as described.
0,Received today,built well,my rhino hose fits perfectly inside.
0,Great set of lights with a great beam pattern. Piaa delivers great products.
0,Fit perfectly.
0,they were so simple to install ,they look great I'm impressed with the quality and workmanship	Thank you
0,Loved this product.
0,Does its job perfectly, no issues, quick shipping and color coded to help you quickly tell where your pressure is with just a glance.
0,AAA+++ thanks
0,It was the rear drivers side door triggering the random alarms.	This device, used with ForScan software, pointed to the exact source of the problem.	Much cheaper than having the dealer diagnose the problem.
0,fast deliver and good product
0,was very pleased on unboxing of the new gauge..this will be used for our sprint kart team an has to be pretty darn accurate!! also was happy with how its made actually quite heavy made well ..will post more apon using of this gauge
0,GREAT ADD ON FOR LOOKS AND ON THE TRAILS.......
0,fit my 2004 Honda Accord Sedan
0,I bought this about a week ago and I'm really happy with it.  Yes, it's a bit expensive.  But, it's built really well and the entire bottom is a rubberized covering that keeps it from sliding around.  The reason I wanted it was to house my winter emergency kit for my SUV.  This holds a set of jumper cables in their nylon case.  A tire patch kit in its plastic case.  A Schumacher PSJ-3612 jump box. And a few basic tools.  Everything fits perfectly with no excess space for things to rattle around.  All together, I've probably got close to 50 lbs of stuff in in this M.O.V.E. organizer and it seems to handle the weight just fine.  Hence why I don't mind the cost as much as other reviewers seem to.  This may be overkill for a few grocery bags.  For what I carry in it, this is exactly what I wanted.
0,Replaced shot pump washer pump on my 2005 Jeep Wrangler X. Reused old grommet. Been working for the last couple months.
0,Pretty straight forward install on the '04 WRX reservoir.	Package comes with pump inlet washer (previous replacement from advance auto did not)		Couple different electrical connectors supplied.
0,Works as expected. So far did not see any problem.
0,Work great in my laptop x also fast delivery
0,Good stuff but DO NOT SPRAY without a fresh air mask an OSHA 95 mask IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. It dries on moisture, something your lungs have lots of. It will kill you. Put on a paint mask and brush OR use a fresh air mask to spray.
0,Lots of suds and cuts dirt and grime leaving a nice shine
0,it is so perfect
0,satisfied!!
0,A well constructed pan, no fitment problems, old one had rusted and was weepping through.
0,Works great! Only gripe is that it's a pretty big gadget.  Over a foot long.  But works well.  Lights up gas stoves like a regular lighter.
0,Good solid mirror. MADE IN USA!!!. I am using this mirror on my Jeep Wrangler. no vibration or bouncing on rough roads.
0,easy to install, need some kind of end warp..... to make look nice.  would buy agai.
0,Fast delivery. I put in my truck and wife's SUV. She left the key on and used it 3 days after she got it. Worked great.
0,This is a solid product.  The compartment is very spacious.  It fits well between the driver and passenger.  I would buy it again.
0,Not to hard to instal. Works like new.
0,Good Sensor Still Working From Day One . Has Not Fail Car Starts Every Time
0,This tire-changing set is of the smaller type, such as working on a wheel barrow tire.  I bought a tube tire also here on amazon, and if you are the impatient, clumsy-type, then you need something like this.		I'm not sure if this will work on automotive wheels because you probably need a bigger set, but like the adage goes: you can never have too many tools, because there is a tool for everything.
0,Nice.
0,I'm glad I bought this.  It not only works well for the intended pupose (under a leaky truck), but I've found myself using it when I'm doing anything messy in the garage.  For example, cleaning/degreasing a greasy part.  Sanding a part for painting, etc.  Thinking about getting another.  Lays flat on the ground, without warping.
0,My words were all rubbed off on my steering wheel switches. The Dorman switches (I replaced all 4)fit like a glove.		The install was difficult because GMC did not give a lot of extra slack in their wires and connectors.		Use a small allen key to hold the connector as you push the switch in place.		Hope this helps someone		2004 Yukon Denali
0,Works as advertised.  I use it in my VW TDI
0,Love it. Looks great with the new back seat just the right height for the arm rest and now I won't be spilling my cofffe, (hopefully). Lost of storage area and easy install.
0,I love these! They are lightweight, easy to adjust and add/remove socket clips. I bought the 1/4 & 3/8 inch drive organizers, and will probably purchase more.
0,Worked as intended, made timing an oddfire V6 a simple task.
0,Great  look in my garage
0,What do you expect more for this pump? It worked smoothly for my front & rear differential oil and transfer case oil replacement.
0,Great lights
0,works as it should. Thanks
0,Great value - brightens up the trunk lights on my Harley.
0,Sonax Full effect works great, but its easy to be wasteful.  No need to worry anymore.  For the price of about 3.5 bottles you get the equivalent of 10 bottles.  Why wouldn't you buy in bulk.
0,OEM Mopar part that arrived timely and easy install!
0,Good stuff, great price.
0,Pretty basic/simple review here:  Great hitch ball, at a great price...  I doubt you could do better anywhere else (I checked everywhere)...
0,Excellent product. Easy to use and secure with padlock.
0,Just Perfect!
0,Awesome, arrived less than a week and worked for my 2007 F150. Only one remote worked but it's a pretty cheap price for a remote which from ford cost $94.99!
0,Very happy with product.
0,Works great. I went with the white so I can see the fuel level.
0,great tube
0,I finally bit the bullet after buying the garage door type from Lowes which does the same thing BUT I couldn't get the 3M VHB tape to stick to the rubber, I tried every trick also and no dice.	So I got my EZ LIP and its installed ASAP, looks great and if it stays on I will order the side body LIP kit also. The little extra extension from the body I figure will keep the little stones and oil spots from hitting the side of the car plus it will give a lower profile	It is not as heavy as the garage door weather stripping & not quite as big but looks terrific. Turns out to cost about the same because the 3M tape is very pricey!!! Got mine with a discount and free shipping from Amazon, yeah!!!
0,My mechanic couldn't get the part fast so I bought it here and am glad I did. All in and running smoothly
0,Perfect fit for 2015 F150 Lariat 4x4 Supercrew - goes right in, no fuss, no muss
0,Have many of these.  Seem to last about 4-5 years before they die
0,Everything fits like a glove. If you are removing your intake seals i highly recommend changing your gaskets. This fits a 2005 BMW 330 Ci coupe.
0,Better thankthought
0,Very bright LED emergency lights, everyone should consider Abrams to be the first choice of LED emergency lighting.
0,After 2 sets of the A/T's, I just put a set of these on my F150. Loved the A/T's, and these look even better with the new designed rugged sidewalls, which I think are tougher. No road noise, and these will be as good in snow as the old tires. A/T's aren't made anymore, but a few places still have some. Last set had 30,000m on, and still had well over half the tread depth. I rotated these every 5-10,000m, and had very even tread wear. Never had any kind of problem with over 2 dozen of these tires on different vehicles over the yrs.
0,This product work as you said, it really works, it makes shine my car, and i really love the meguiars products
0,this item exact the way it show and it's good and easy to instal i recomend this to anyone and every one
0,Good product.
0,I,ve tried all kinds on seats and cushions this one works just got back off of a 5 day ride 1600 miles very comfortable
0,Much better signal.
0,I can really feel the difference, still can feel as a new oil change even after 2k mile. Will stay with this one as long as i can still afford it
0,Used on a cast iron cylinder head. Be careful when you tap the hole out to install the Helicoil. Go slowly and use a good sealer on the Helicoil threads. I saved the cylinder head on my 1994 Dodge Ram 5.2 L. I let the sealer dry for 48 hours (J-B weld) it's strong and hi-temp.
0,The product arrived in excellent condition & works great.
0,I used it in a fifth wheel trailer just to see how it would do (and hopefully extend the battery life) and it's "OK" enough to light up the main area. The one I put over the bed is more then bright enough. I have it in a single bulb housing above the bed and one in a dual bulb housing in the main area. If I just use the single LED in the duo housing in the main area it's adequate but not bright. I rarely use the second one. The only down side is the tape on the back isn't good enough for the round reflector and won't stay stuck. Right now it's just laying on the lens. It does get hot but not enough to crack/burn the 20 year old plastic covers.	 It was just an experiment to see how they were and I'm happy with what they are capable of.	 By the way, I also have a similar one in my F150 dome light and it is almost too bright.
0,Worked great for mounting secondary fans in front of my AC condenser to improve cooling in traffic.
0,I've polished a lot of cars, and this product works very nicely.  I've used it also on heavily oxidized satin black window trim by hand with fantastic results. The trim was so faded, it required three passes and I may have to do a fourth. I was worried about scratching the trim, but it works better than anything else for that.  It also takes the oxidation off of black plastic trim (probably not recommended for that).  After cleaning the paint with painters clay, I used a Random Orbital polisher on the paint of a 20 year old car. Looked great. Looked even better when I did it a second time. It is mild, so you can't scratch or do damage.  Followed with Meguiar's  NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0; fantastic!.  Tough stuff will require a heavier "cut" or more heavy duty compound.  It is the easiest to use Rubbing Compound I've tried; easy on and off as well as easy clean up of applicator pads. Recommended. My steps in the car polishing process: Turtle Wax Bug and Tar remover behind the wheel wells as necessary, Mother's clay bar paint cleaner, Meguiar's Ultimate Compound, Meguiar's Tech Wax 2.0 (2X year, don't forget to mask off rubber and plastic trim with this product).  In between car washes, I mix up myself and use diluted Optimum No Rinse Wash & Shine as a Quick Detailer, effective and very economical. That's it!
0,Installed on my 1971 Mercury 1350 inline 6 cylinder. Drop in replacement, had all the parts I needed to replace the impeller, stainless steel base plate, pump housing, and even the lower pump housing (I would have replaced that too if the bolts weren't seized into the lower unit) But now my water outlet line had a very strong stream of water coming out of it, no overheating, works great
0,Is good
0,Very satisfied
0,Good sturdy quality hose.
0,Great service, part fit perfectly. Even came with instructions.
0,No problems with this vendor but I have to write a long message just to	finish this up  and be finished with you
0,Put them on my half ton Silverado pickup. It's a 1999 and they look great. Can never get them to be water tight. Guess that's the way they are normally. Little drops of water inside lenses.
0,Works great		Is used to transfer lacquer thinner
0,perfect
0,A snap to install and I've had no issues with it.
0,These are replacements to my standard high beam bulbs for winter driving in snowy conditions and coupled with my yellow tinted Hella 500 driving lamps, they work very well indeed.
0,works great
0,Comfy; transformed my Vulcan 900 Classic into a tourer (well almost). All day comfy. It does not feel good at first; give it a few days. It also fit perfectly.
0,It was a snap to install.  I've only used the RV once since we installed it and I think it made a big difference in reception and locking into distant signals.  We're leaving for a 10-day vacation next week and hope it will made a big difference in our viewing.
0,I detail my car as a hobby and its something I truly love. I am sure if you are reading this review then you are just like me. I have used just about every tire shine out there, and this is by far the best and lasts a long time. I have also done a good amount of research to make sure this doesn't damage my cars trim or tires, and based on everything I have read it is water based gel (which is what you want). I use this on my tires, and I apply a small amount to the plastic trim on the OUTSIDE of my car and it makes it look brand new/ protect it from sun damage/fading. My advice when applying to the outside plastic trim is to apply it lightly, then go back and gently wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. If you leave it on heavy it can collect dirt and grime, which isn't good. Also use a separate applicator for your tires and your outside plastic trim to ensure your not getting tire gunk on your trim.
0,I was hesitant about buying this after reading so many reviews about packaging and missing pieces, but I did. It came well packaged with a box in a box, all the hardware (6 rollers and 2 wrenches). Assemble time 5-10 minutes. Good height for seat	and moves around effortlessly.
0,Tried 4-6 other brands from spray foam to gel apply by pad, so far this works great and fast to apply. Bought from Costco 4months ago, but couldn't find it any more. :(
0,The coolant filtration is a must on these trucks. If these are installed earlier on in the trucks life then the likelihood of the engine blowing up is diminished. After 3 months of having it installed I finally changed the filter(i know it should be within a month of having it on). I had to stab it with a flathead screwdriver to release the pressure that was built up in it to even unscrew it. The filter was completely filled with brown coolant and a ton of sand and dirt. I wish I had a picture of what came out of the filter.. This coolant filtration kit works wonders definately get it for your 6.0!
0,Works great! Thank you!
0,This is my third Weather Tech Cargo liner and they are the best ones considering the snug fit.  A little higher but worth the difference in my book.
0,Fit my 2012 Ford Escape with no problems alot smoother and quieter paired with porcelain pads will buy these for all my vehicles.
0,Work very nice wasn't hard to put on
0,Perfect for my car
0,I have a Qwest large helmet and it would fog up all the time I had to ride with the face shield cracked open. With the GT-Air I can ride with the shield down and the pin lock installed. The shield still fogs around the pin lock but the view is clear. Also the air flow is great. A lot better than the Qwest. Also the GT-Air is quieter and better aerodynamically. The Qwest would bob and weave in the wind at around 75. The sun shade is great I wish I had it before. If you can afford the GT-Air buy it. If not get the Qwest and spring the extra for the pin lock shield and pin lock. But then you are close to the cost of the GT-air. The GT-Air seems lighter also.
0,love it
0,what can you say,  built well and levels up the ramp on the toy hauler
0,perfect fit on 2004 Chevy Tahoe
0,Worked as advertised. Very good handles and metal.	Fixed a flat in 10 minutes and didn't even have to take the wheel off the car. Now that the weather is getting nicer, it's been about 2 months, the fix is barley noticeable and no leak.	Great Product
0,Looks good would buy again
0,Has worked great so far. I feel a little hesitant on tightening the telescope adjustment on it too tight as it feels a little "light" but it was less than $10. I can't complain at all.
0,This product fit like the original but be aware you'll have to remove the lower fitting from the original tank & put it on this one
0,Best of the best
0,Looks awesome
0,Looks good,seems to work good
0,Repair Clinic and E-Replacement Parts have parts. E Replacement Parts has exploded views of equipment. Stens has a FULL-LINE catalog for ALL kinds of 2 and 4 cycle equipment. It is a VERY good catalog! Stens has parts in bulk. Amazon has it. Get the 12" hemostat pliers or the 45 degree hemostat pliers to replace fuel lines and filters. Cut lines at a slant to ease installation of fuel lines. Use needle nose pliers to loosen stuck fuel lines. Work them back and forth to loosen it. Replace the Diaphram regularly to prevent trouble. Amazon has mixture tools individually and in sets. Set the lo mixture for highest RPM's at idle and hi mixture for highest RPM's at full-throttle. Set the idle on a chainsaw just until the chain just stops turning.
0,Great oil. Made for people like me that take short trips.
0,No More Clunk!! Super easy to swap out too.
0,Perfect

0,Fits 2015 Triumph explorer perfectly
0,I JUST LOVE THIS SPINNER KNOB....THE SHAPE IS WHAT I LIKE THE MOST AND ALSO THE COLOR.... IT MATCHES MY WOODGRAIN STEERING WHEEL....IT MAKES MY GOLF CART SO MUCH EASIER TO TURN
0,Installed 6 months ago - Still works like brand new.  No issues.
0,Worked great.  The only product i found that had 5 of them.  Needed one for the spare.
0,no complaints. The product is exactly as it was advertised. Also, it shipped quickly. Would recommend as a product that works perfectly at a great price. fit my 08 canyon
0,Works like it says. I love that this was available as I had a lil scratching incident with my motorcycle. however this covered it right up, and the color matching was awesome! I have a matte black bike and this did the trick...it isn't a 100% color match but its pretty darn close and you don't notice and actually can't see where it was applied unless you know where it is.
0,Shipped quickly without any leaks.
0,Nice cheap set of chocks to keep in the trailer.  Four of them have been sitting outside for about three months now and they're fading out, so I question how long they will hold up to the UV, but that's ok.
0,Some trimming involved for  flap installs.	Not even difficult & price helps.
0,Great tool.
0,Looks awesome, just as described. Very durable tough, thick plastic.
0,great price for this product.
0,Quick install. Looks great!
0,I had been using a Accutire car gage on my motorcycles in the past and finally got tired of how awkward it was to use.  I bought this gage and I have been very satisfied with it.  It's so easy to check tires even when they have twin bake disk in the way.  The quality is not what I have been used to the past with other Accutire gages.  On a 1 to 10 scale I give it 6.5 on quality fit and finish.  I have found it to be very accurate and easy to use.  I would buy it again without hesitation.
0,Love those
0,great
0,Fit perfectly. Easy install. Did need a second set of hands as it was not easy to line up on my own. Very secure.
0,Its worth every penny. Tried to unbolt the crankshaft with a long breaker bar (2 people), tried with impact gun regular socket. Same impact gun, with this socket, unbolted in a heartbeat.
0,very good engine paint
0,great tool
0,My truck was running poorly so having been talked into it I bought a couple of cans of this and treated one tank w/a can and a half . Drove 30 miles to town and all was good , couldn't believe it . Saved 500 bucks for a tune up . Never believed "Tuneup in a can" . Now my tractors , garden tractor, rototiller , chainsaws etc. have been serviced .
0,Nice sponge. Holds shape nicely after just on use.
0,Awesome GPS, 3 years no issues solid gamin device
0,I purchased this Spectre Air Filter for a 2000 Dodge Dakota V6 in a attempt to improve fuel mileage. I have not noticed an increase or decrease in MPG but have noticed an increase in power. I would estimate at least 15 HP increase compared to a stock paper air filter. So if your looking to gain MPG, I don't see finding it in a High Performance air filter. As for Spectre brand air filters, I feel that they are as good if not better than high dollar brand name filters.
0,couldn't find a 10", so I had to get this one and trim off 2".
0,Good quality sticker
0,Good product, good price.
0,Fixed my malfunctioning 2 speed Mountaineer fan now it blows all 4 speeds like new. Use 8mm socket and 5 minutes to install after opening glove box and releasing by squeezing 2 side taps (inward motion) I had easy access to view it on fire wall on passenger side . Helpful YouTube video.
0,Perfect!
0,Way overpriced (cheap packaging... looked like a $5 shelf item at a dollar store), but works as advertised. Visibility is good/clear and the mirror does not vibrate, which was a surprising claim. The mirrors are being used on a Cannondale Slate CX-1... I'm using the left mirror only. Overall, I'm a happy customer. The four star rating is due to the rediculous pricing.		Install is simply just wedging the end of the bar through the handlebars. The only thing hold the mirror in place is friction from a plastic ball in a rubber sleeve.
0,Awesome!  Best investment! Beats pulling the fuse for sure.
0,Installed in my 2013 Tacoma DCSB with no problems. Works great, no complaints.
0,Everything fit perfectly and ran perfectly. Any benefits could be in my head. But it's at least OEM.
0,Fits great, no issues.
0,Use these in my 2005 Honda Accord Coupe for the 168 tag lights they are Super bright! Also used them for door courtesy lights, remember LED lights are directional and these work perfectly in situations where lamp points downward toward tags or straight out like in my door lights.  I bought different configuration LED lamps where the lamp is installed on its side.
0,Works as it supposed to, I do like the print on it.
0,this is a grate buy

0,Great and inexpensive replacement for my nephew's 2000 Nissan Pathfinder.

0,No problems with it, works fine and have had it on a month so far.
0,Worked perfectly for my 2005 Acura MDX. Easy to install.
0,Easy to use
0,This is also a nice filter for the price.  Workable quality and looks like the picture which is good.  Will buy again is the price stays.
0,The instructions and hardware included are spot on, took me about an hour to do with all hand tools, fit like a champ, and tows like a beast!
0,Perfect replacement for my air compressor tires... Idk how I would have gotten these on if I didn't have 2 piece wheels...
0,Well made solid unit that was a perfect fit for my 07 outback.  The only gripe I have is that it didn't include the mounting bolts.  I would gladly have paid $5 - $10 to get 4 correct bolts.  The old ones on my 10 year old car were totally shot.  It took an age and a vast array of chemicals to get them off the car and I certainly couldn't use the again.  Had to go to the Subaru dealer in mid project to get new bolts
0,So it must work -- it's cheap, it's new, it's a good deal, it worked for my 2010 Honda Pilot.
0,Perfect size, perfect addition to my truck. It is as it is described. Size was pretty noticeable from a distance from the rear of my truck! Bling baby.
0,Bought for 2008 GMC 2500HD, perfect fit and got rid of the squeaking noise on start up.
0,Easy to install, sounds great.  Trucks running good.  Easy to clean filter.  Can't go wrong with K&N complete kit.
0,ok
0,perfect oem replacement. takes less than 5 minutes to install
0,Works great
0,have not used yet, but looks good. next months trip to the Keys will tell more.
0,I bought this to replace my broken blower motor.  It was cheaper than purchasing it at the dealer.  Install was fairly simple.  It works as expected.
0,Nice heavy bar, looks very nice. It was easy to install. I have noticed this same bar on many other trucks since I bought it, seems to be very popular.
0,I've always had good experiences with Rugged Ridge products (except their Hood Struts; see my review detailing my issues on that product's page:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rugged-Ridge-11252-51-Hood-Lift-Kit/dp/B002SV43QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rugged Ridge 11252.51 Hood Lift Kit</a>&nbsp;.) Having purchased multiple sets of assorted brands and styles of window visors, I've come to appreciate their simple good looks and function. It is nice to be able to crack the window in a rain or snowstorm and not be drenched.		During unboxing, I immediately noticed that Rugged Ridge does NOT supply alcohol prep pads like AVS and other manufacturers do. For that, I deduct one star. They would be perfect otherwise. Make sure that you use isopropyl alcohol to clean the areas around your windows where the window visors will stick to. Alcohol removes grease, wax, dirt, and other contaminants and dries immediately.
0,After installing a less expensive brand of strut, I had to change them out within 3 months because of the knocking. I bought the Monroe Sensa-Trac strut and have had no issues. The vehicle drives like it is new. Buying a reputable brand name strut is a must. I learned this lesson the hard way.
0,I replaced the original 41-962 plugs with these 41-100 plugs.  I gapped all six plugs to .040 using the wire tool.  I think that I will achieve better fuel mileage and more effecient engine operation by using these Plugs.
0,Perfect
0,Fairly easy to set up.  Settings can be easily changed to match engine size, fuel, etc.  Shows exactly what the OBD (On-Board Diagnostic Computer) is reading from the engine.  Shows you how you can increase fuel economy but decreasing pressure on accelerator & reamin at the same speed on highway.
0,Looks good better than niteshades. Oem quality, I learned from old ones and drilled a "drip" hole on the bottom and haven't had any problems
0,Good car wash!
0,Really decent tires & rims! We saved so much money over local retailers who wanted nearly double the money. We received "Vail VR383" tires and after nearly 1000 miles they have no wear I can see. The hold air great and track straight as an arrow. A great deal!		UPDATE 8/4/2017:	These tires and rims are doing great! The tread wear is minimal and the rims look like new. These are used on a 1 ton capacity trailer that hauls my ATV to various destinations which means lots of on & off-road use and they perform very well. When they do need replacing I hope I can pick up another set of these! Still a solid buy!
0,Very good oil at a good price.
0,Great buy
0,grabs very well my only gripe would be the throw out bearing makes a little more noise when cold than what i expected.
0,As described and storage case is compact.
0,Bought these for my Nissan Pathfinder and it holds the cargo door really well. Paid 1/4 the price for these, compared the original ones from the dealer.
0,Exactly what I wanted and expected, thank you for the fast and friendly service!
0,I bought these to replace the 3157 bulbs that came stock on my Polaris RZR because the OEMs are notorious for melting the lens. If I were to do it again though, I would just buy the LEDs that are available through www.superbrightleds.com. They are plug and play, no resistors needed. Make sure you order the CK version.
0,Works great, allows me to monitor stuff like manifold pressure on my Veloster Turbo (why they don't have a boost gauge, I don't know), but also has handy things like AFR, and more! Will also let me read check engine codes should they show up.
0,Great fit. Was able to install it this past weekend. Haven't got a chance to test it out as the car is out. But soon. Should work as expected, don't see why not.
0,Well made and works well!
0,I would recommend this fabric, it looks great in my Honda Accord, I couldn't have matched the leather up any better myself!
0,I have been driving on these for the last two years and impressive performance
0,Fit great look great work great thanks g.m.
0,If you're the type of person who really obeys manufacturer instructions, you'd be lead to believe that transmission fluid is vehicle make-specific. And you'd waste money on crappier fluids.		I first heard about GM Synchromesh Friction Modified Manual Transmission Fluid from a friend who said it solved some of the problems my track-day toy was experiencing. That toy is a stripped-down Honda S2000 that I push very hard. On some very hard shifts into 2nd or 3rd, the car would literally "reject" the gear and pop into neutral as soon as I let go of the clutch. It didn't happen all the time, but it was often enough that it was bothering me.		Being that I like to take care of my toys, I flush both the differential fluid and the MTF on the S2000 every 5k miles. Yes, that's excessive, but even street-driven S2000s are apparently adept at dirtying up oil, requiring MTF changes after 10k or so. On one of those changes, I tried using the Synchromesh Friction Modified fluid. The car didn't screw up the shifts even once with this fluid inside.		Always the experimenter, I went back to MTF from Honda for the next flush. The problems were back. The next change was with GM's NOT-Friction-Modified Synchromesh. The bad shifts seemed less frequent, but they were still there. It wasn't a scientific study, so I can't really say if it truly WAS less frequent with the regular Synchromesh or if it was just in my head, but it did feel that way. The next shift was with Royal Purple's Synchromax MTF. This was as bad as Honda's fluid. Finally, I then went back to the GM Friction Modified stuff, and all was perfect again. Believe me, I am not the kind of guy to buy into hype and make stupid statements about products' performance based on some ridiculous seat-of-the-pants observation. This stuff works like a charm.		Is it going to fix a transmission in need of a complete overhaul? No. If bad shifts are the norm rather than the exception, don't think that fresh fluid is the answer. But if your transmission is acting just a little finicky when you're being a little aggressive, this might be just what you need to reign it in.
0,I use this to smooth down a few medium depth scratches in my two months old Rolex. I only rub about 20 times to reduce the scratches to nearly visible. I think I can completely remove the scratches with this product but I just don't want to worn down the metal too much. It works with very little effort on my part. I think this is a great product.
0,works great
0,As described
0,Works as it should .....it is well worth it to acquire this wrench because without it removing the fan clutch is almost impossible.
0,Works exactly as advertised
0,I can see
0,Replaced 1141 lamps in motorhome. Nice bright white light
0,Great grease, lots of grease.
0,Worked as advertised, fit my 96 Camaro SS. Had to drill out the two rivets to mount it but you have to do this with any coil.

0,Good
0,These lights are awsome!!! Slick looking and bright!!! The wire that came witht he kit was ok... had to add a few feet.. Did not and will not ever use the cheap wire connectors that they send!!! Thats a big problem with trailers, the cheap wire connectors that are used that corrode and cause problems like the lights to stop working or short out! Spend a few extra dollars and use the connectors that have shrink tubing made on them! I recommend these lights!
0,Just what my car needed. Perfect fit for my 1999 Nissan Maxima. Standard parts are quality parts at low cost. Fast Shipping!!!
0,Finally a LED bulb that fits the license plate lamps on my Nissan Titan. Most LED's are too long to fit the housing, but these were perfect. Nice, bright white light. Non polarity led's, so if the lamp doesn't light, turn it 180 degrees and it will work. Consider these if your license lamp(s) use a W5W or 194 bulb.
0,Engine noise decreased and MPG increased!
0,easy to install perfect fit
0,Best bleeder ever made.  I've done 100's of brake jobs using various bleeding tools.  These speed bleeders made is so easy, it wasn't even a job.  I just installed them in the calipers and hooked up a bleeder bag and pumped the brakes. I bled and flushed all the calipers at one time with no helper.  I'll buy a set of these for every vehicle I own.
0,Nissan service mgr told me not to use aftermarket air filters, claimed they're somehow different from OEM and can cause engine damage! Compared this new filter to the old one installed by Nissan, and guess what they're the exact same (see my product photos) down to the markings on the side.
0,As described
0,2002ford focus ztw 2.0 16V great
0,Works as expected. Tight enough not to loose it on the road,  but still easy to remove also for my wife
0,Finally, an affordable replacement for these lights.  Looks great, same quality as OEM, but much less than other aftermarket AND OEM sellers.  Direct replacement!
0,No rattles anymore! Works great with my Teraflex shackles and Warn m8000s winch.  Well made.
0,this small replacement antenna is amazing...stylish and compact it is a direct replacement for my 2008 Tundra antenna. small but strong, I'm getting more stations than with the original antenna.
0,Would've given it 5 stars if it came with nee o-rings
0,Good looking tires. Great price. Glad I ordered them.
0,Awesome!  Gives a real nice clean look / shine to my black charger, love it.  And probably the coolest part is the smell.....ahhhhhh.
0,As always... good product for the money.  Will keep your carpets looking very nice.  Should last a long time.  Nice that they have clips to keep them from sliding around.
0,fast shipping, great product
0,Excellent product, will buy again and recommend it.
0,Great fit...will buy again!
0,Used the seal on a tack room door on my trailer, works great. Thanks
0,Ive used these before and they are an easy solution to banging your head on the corner of your slide-out.  They are easy to apply, and seem to be secure (we had them on our last rig for  couple years with no problems).  They look better than the colored foam swim noodles that a lot of people use.		Ordered on Amazon, good price, fast delivery.
0,I thought these stickers were really funny.  To my dismay, no one else seems to get the joke.  If they do, they sure don't act like it.		Anyway, they still bring a smile to my face when I see them, so (blank) 'em if they don't see the humor in it.
0,The handle was easy to install, bolted up and works great. If and when this one breaks, I will choose a metal handle.
0,no comment needed for rating
0,You can never go wrong with OEM
0,This made the tire changes on my dr650 a lot easier. Should have got 2 but I already had a few from harbor freight. I ordered another
0,Not really sure if Royal Purple motor oil is that much better than others. Amazon offers a pretty decent price.
0,easy to install and work great
0,Confirmed accurate by other gauge and vehicle's tire monitor!
0,Excellent Product! Well made! These have very little wind noise and drag and they actually look good sitting on top the vehicle when not in use. Use them all the time though and they are holding up well. Easy to use. Easy to assemble. Took me 10 minutes to mount these on my 2012 Honda Civic Sedan by myself (first time user). Definately recommend!!! Don't wait!!! Buy these!!! You won't regret it!!!
0,The Auto Ventshade's work as expected.	Install in minutes.	Effectively provide additional sun glare protection.	More importantly, on rainy days the Ventshades allow me to crack the windows 2-3" preventing water from entering my vehicle.
0,Replaced some T5 fluorescent light fixtures that the ballasts went bad in with these. Very bright over my rv sink with far less power consumption being LED.
0,Exactly what I was looking for. Needed something for my 2014 F150 because I lifted it and added bigger wheels and tires.  When going into a Peking structure my stock antenna would hit every cross beam in and out.  I don't care about reception as I mostly listen to satellite radio + my own personal music collection.
0,The convenience of being able to simply remove the filter with a wrench is worth the price difference.		I cannot vouch for how good or bad the filter is, my oil color has not changed when switched from Fram to K&N.
0,Super bright!!! Love these, pretty durable as well. I have mounted them under my golf cart, works great! (I plan to buy more!!
0,Works great.  I had gotten another brand before and it was not as advertised. It was supposed to be a wired "Y" but was not.  It blew the fuse on my truck's 4-flat connection.  This hookup is very good.  It works like a champ. There is plenty of length to hook up my light stick and still have a convenient place to plug my trailer into. Very sturdy construction.  Use grease with the connections to keep them water tight.
0,Great
0,fits and works great.....
0,I change my filters every six k miles. I have had no issues with these filters. And a competitive price on Amazon.
0,I run with these close to the max capacity but they worked well. I would purchase them again.
0,Aluminum unit vs plastic, I didn't care,  but not as advertised.  Works great!
0,Pros:  Cost effective and look great with my BF Goodrich KO/2s		Cons:  I had to get hub centering rings to make up for the gap between this wheel's 83 bore and my 1998 Jeep TJ's 71 hub size.  I know a lot of people here have gotten by without the centering rings, but I prefer them as a matter of safety and to reduce wear.  So now the problem is that by using the centering rings, the caps can't be used. I am looking for button caps that will work, now.
0,ok
0,Perfect fit. Just what I needed. Should have bought them sooner. Really cleaned up the console with the blanks installed.
0,Excellent garage quality tool.	I wish I had this unit when I was in the auto repair business.
0,Works great, simple to install, no more worries about campground power supply.
0,Covers the spare tire for  my F450 beautifully.
0,Nice fit
0,good knob at a good price. had to adapt to make it fit. still worth buying.
0,I bought one of these back in 1997 for tuning my carburetted engines.  I don't know how I got along without it!
0,Can't use !!
0,These work great.  The only problem is the cap easily gets pulled off when driving through mud and rocks.
0,I have used this for two years on my Boston Whaler. It is easy to apply and holds up to salt water. I also suggest the Shurhold power buffer.
0,a perfect change for the trailer
0,Didn't use for my car window but still funny
0,does not fit 97 ford explorer awd 5.0
0,The mounting system with rubber blocks does not look strong enough to me but if you add a whole bunch of black silicone between these rails and the bed sides, not only do you seal that gap but also it becomes indestructible. Other than that they looks great and the sliding rack adds a lot of functionality to your truck.
0,Love this bumper!  Fits perfectly.  I had put the end caps on before I mounted the bumper.  I think it might have been easier to access the mounting nuts with the end off.  Use of an air ratchet is a plus.  The mounting bolts are on the long side.
0,Heavy duty and fits nicely!
0,This is cheap and it works. Just wash out the cloth when you are done, put it back on the arm and let it dry.
0,Very complex an simple to wire up i own and operate a automotive shop so it took maybe ten minutes to install but anyone can install this kit saves time and money in the long run because lights not ran through a relay can adventually cause wiring problems on your vehicle.
0,good
0,This is a heavy mat and will hold up well in my new Ram 2500 truck.  My truck has a factory sprayed in bed liner and this goes on top to keep cargo from sliding around and also to keep the rough finish on the liner from scratching it up.  The fit is reasonably good and fits the bed.  It is very slightly short on the upper end but not enough to be problematic.  This is my second Dee Zee mat.  First was put in a F150 4 1/2 years ago and it has held up very well.  I would buy these again.
0,Way better than I expected - super easy to put on - and car is so slick I have had issues closing the doors lol - I put it on inside and outside of the new Civic Si:)
0,I installed these in my 07 Expedition along with QYL COPs. The Expedition hasn't run so smooth in months. You actually have to look at the tach to make sure it's still running. It's that smooth. When I changed the plugs at 75k miles, I had six break. The ones I put back in I used anti-seize on. They all came out this time at 200k miles on the clock...
0,fits perfect, seems well made,
0,Original equipment filter. Not much more can really be said. It worked as advertised.
0,This thing works great. I plug it in to my car and use it to air up my motorcycle tires. It works fast and is easy to enter exact psi you want. For the price it was well worth it. Good job manufacturers.
0,Great product. Used for many years with my aircraft. Have not tried it now on my RV but I'm sure will perform as well.
0,I had been adding about a quart of oil per 1,000 miles driven, but no more-
0,good match
0,Item as advertised and arrived very quickly!  Was a perfect fit and easy to install.  The labels on each rotor ensure you get them in the correct position, which matters since they are slotted and the front and rear units are different.  The pads came with all clips and some chatter lube.  These really eliminated hopping and steering wheel feedback under braking.  The braking power was also very good.  Be sure to put anti-seize compound between your rotor and hub when you install these, it will make it much easier to remove the rotor if you ever have to replace them.  Once you beat on the old rotors to get them off you will see why I mention the anti-seize.
0,Bought my 2015 Subaru Crosstrek brand new. 1st oil change was done at the dealer as it was free. I've been using Castrol Edge 0W-20 Advanced ever since every 5k. The 1st oil change I did with Castrol Edge made a difference that was immediately noticeable. Subaru's tend to have quite a bit of valve tick anyway, but this oil immediately improved the sound and made it much quieter. A lot of online research on oil brands kept looping me back to Castrol Edge. I didn't notice any MPG increases or decreases, but I'm sure if it did change, it was marginal at best. I'm glad I gave it a try!
0,This is exactly as pictured, and a great value for the price. The only concern I has would be getting it all back in the bag so snuggly after taking something out =D
0,Perfect for my BRZ! Really bright. I think anything with more LEDs would be over kill. This pic was taken at night.
1,didn't fit truck
1,The mirror fir great but the mirror inside the unit shakes and is so loose you can not see out it while driving, I was very disappointed as my factory passenger side mirror has no problem nor did my drivers side until I replaced it.... get what you pay for in this case...
1,Not even close to being an exact match. I clear coated and sanded and it was still off.
1,I have no idea how to use this product and it's pretty scary because it gets super hot. I would feel totally uncomfortable placing it under my car, but people have, so they probably know exactly how to do it so the place doesn't burn down!
1,Mine lasted just 6 months on LS430 before it became intermittent. If you're replacing it yourself, you've probably unscrewed the back and looked inside your original one and seen the copper wipers and the conductive tracks they ride on. I took apart this failing Dorman and discovered that its wipers have sharp ends that ride on and dig into the conductive tracks, wearing away the track in a short time. I don't know of any other reasonably priced alternative. You likely know that the purpose of this system is to keep your bright HID headlights level and out of the eyes of oncoming drivers. One could install a Dorman but disconnect the linkage that continually moves the contacts as the car changes level. Then you could by trial and error turn the screw portion of the Dorman to set the headlight level permanently where you want it for normal load conditions. Just use a flashlight at night and reach behind the rear tire to the adjusting screw. A 2-3 minute effort for each "trial".
1,I thought it would fit my son's JVC stereo but it did not. No hassle returning it though and got it shipped to me pretty quickly.
1,it gets in the way more than it helps. i don't like having on my visor and the gap between the visor and the shade still lets the sun in.
1,This claims it works for 6, 7, 8 inch balancers. On a smaller balancer the timing tab is so far away from the timing marks it's darn near impossible to know where it actually lines up. I bent the timing marks so they were right next to the balancer and that helped but it's still difficult to determine exactly where it's pointing. More like within 4 degrees. One of the screw holes that hold the adjustable timing pointer to the base was stripped out too.
1,Not a true 20 mm carb . I measured it to be 19.4 mm
1,didn't appear to do anything
1,I bought this kit for my 99 Ford Explorer tailgate latch. It doesn't work for it, the latch rod is too big for the for the clamp, putting too much stress on the plastic causing it to break.
1,Garbage.
1,This product didn't fit our Mercedes C300 2012
1,no the size i need
1,DO NOT BUY . Use the 5$ self bleed kit at the auto parts store ! This thing was a complete joke I'm really good with my hands and I have every tool you could think of this tool was definitely one to be thrown away  I tried using it for about 10 minutes and realized it's a piece of junk and it does not work correctly the idea is definitely a great idea just doesn't perform
1,Nowhere in the item description does it say this cover should be used indoors only.  It was only when I went on the Rugged Ridge website did I find this revelation. I only went on their website because this cover was delivered with no instructions or explanation..however, there was a sheet of paper enclosed that stated if it was installed improperly the warranty would be voided...?? Call that your classic CYA...don't tell you how to install it but if you install it wrong they void the warranty.		How about giving an accurate explanation of what's being offered.  I guess the icing on the cake was the 1 day shipping I paid for on April 30th and it arrived on May 3rd.  I'm going to keep this purchase because its more of a hassle trying to return it.  But I can assure you my future Jeep item purchases will be done somewhere else....not a happy camper.
1,Does not work
1,This starter fixed my mower and it worked great...for four months. Now the bendix doesn't want to raise by itself no matter how many times I remove the entire starter assembly and clean it.
1,Switched to k and n and couldn't be happier, I'll spend the few extra bucks everytime
1,Really disappointed! I used the dressing that comes with cover and after 3 weeks the black is turning purple.
1,Wires are small and connectors do not have a tight fit and can be plugged in either way which will put positive to negative which is not good. I guess some times you do get what you pay for
1,Don't buy these straps, ripped in less than a week. Good thing I saved the factory straps. I had to rate at least 1 star in order to submit review. But not even worth 1 star!!
1,Not for a 2009 Ford Focus. The bolt hole is to small for the transmission bolt.
1,I guess one of the only pro about this jack is the cost, but that's not saying much. It becomes very apparent after using this jack that it's not designed for anything, but the very occasional user. One of the first problems I had with this jack is the front wheel; one fell off while pushing it across the garage floor. A quick inspection revealed that the nuts that hold the wheels on have nothing to stop them from spinning off. I ended up removing both wheel nuts and reinstalling them with red thread locker.		After a few more weeks of use the rear casters kept sticking making it hard to push the jack around. I took those apart and found the grease on the thrust bearings to be dried out. I cleaned all the dried out grease and used Phil Wood Waterproof Grease for extra protection. The jack held together fine for a few more months until it started leaking fluid, which rendered it fit for the scrap heap. The jack has a 1-year warranty, but the shipping to send it back is not worth it so keep that in mind. I tried contacting the Torin several times to see if I could just send back the hydraulic part of the jack, but they never responded back.
1,I couldn't get a tight fit around the door handles.  Where the door contours to the window was also a problem area.  I ended up not installing these because the fit made the finish look bad.  My jeep is orange and it really shows how this doesn't fit well.
1,wrong size for my light.
1,The tread is not evenly applied, very visible wobble when riding.  Filed a claim with Maxxis for replacement and they requested more pictures - I sent more and no reply even sent a follow up email - so their product is deffective and their customer service sucks.  I really liked how the tire performed but I don't want to pay more money and risk getting anouther defective tire.
1,All 4 light strips arrived cracked in the middle due to being folded in half.  But what can you expect for $6?
1,Returned them because mounting parts were missing. Reordered, and the next set was missing the wiring. They looked new and unopened, so I not sure if it is an Amazon issue, or a manufacturing issue.  Decided to punt and get something else. Cannot comment on brightness.
1,After having owned an older Mityvac model for more than six years of heavy use it finally failed and I bought this as a replacement.  In less than 15 months and after much lighter use than I put the old one through the new model has failed, having the very same issue as other reviewers - oil sprays out of the pump handle making a huge mess.  In my case the vacuum was substantially reduced so it would not extract oil even after wrapping the handle and furiously pumping.  This purchase was complete waste of money and I can't believe Mityvac hasn't addressed the problem after several years of complaints.  I'm done with Mityvac products.		I have ordered a Moeller 7 liter extractor as a replacement, for which I can find no negative reviews.
1,Do have the time today return it , it showed as if it was soaking in water for its faithful jorney.
1,will not fit in 2000 lesabre w/o modifying
1,I have a job ahead of me.		I generally like Armorall and thought this would be worth a try to keep the modestly nice wheels on my new Sportwagen cleaner. I bought the product, followed the directions with care and now have a clean up job ahead of me.		Armorall DOES tell you that the product will leave white "residue" on your tires as it runs off the wheel. What they do NOT tell you is that it will also leave all sorts of white junk on the wheels and that this "residue" really shows up on a black painted or anodized surface.		PROS:		Full refund from Armor All is on the way		CONS:		- Leaves a sticky mess	- Looks like hell on black	- Costs more than $12 for a modest can		I'll update this when I get the wheels cleaned up.
1,Fun untill the piston comes off. Now i have a connecting rod toy.
1,So I just started hauling loads with my 1988 ford super duty. I just started a 3000 mile trip, and about 300 miles into the trip, my engine overheats, with coolant gushing from bottom of radiator. Get towed to Ford dealer where they replace radiator that they assumed was cracked. A mile later, overheats again, so they replace thermostat. Good for about 150 miles, overheats again, but this time very gradual, and coolant dripping heavily from engine. I assume the worse, either cracked block or head gasket, probably damaged from previous overheating. Out of desperation, I purchase this from walmart, followed instructions by pouring it in and let the engine run for 20 minutes. I let it sit for about 3 hours while I napped in the walmart parking lot. With zero confidence that this will work, I continue on my trip with 10,000 pounds in tow. 2500 miles later, enginestaying cool as ever and hasn't leaked a drop. I never would have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. As far as being a permanent fix, only time will tell, because I plan on putting through the test with my transport business. I certainly hope the people with the bad reviews got double their money back. Picture is of actual load being hauled while all that happened.		UPDATE: It's been about 2-3 weeks since I used this stuff. My truck sat for almost 2 weeks after returning from that 3000 mile trip, and I just returned from a 1000 trip and I could not take my eyes off the temp gauge. It was running noticeably hotter this trip and my stomach was in knots the whole time. I think it is playing havoc on my new thermostat. I noticed when first starting it, that it gets a lot hotter before the thermostat initially opens open and I think it's not opening all the way because this gunk prevents it from doing so. Tomorrow, I'm flushing my cooling system and hopefully get most of this glue out and especially spray a hard stream through the thermostat. It pisses me off that the bottle says to leave it in there for continued protection. I just hope that I don't develop my leak once I flush out all the excess. I will be contacting the manufacturer about the refund!
1,Useless.  Completely useless.  Multiple times I've tried it.  Even letting it soak over night.  Can't even dissolve simple paper gaskets.		I think glue would be more effective.
1,Doesn't REALLY fit, I have a pronto 24, and while it WILL go on, it DOESN'T fit properly over the joystick. NOW; to be sure, it is well made, but the cover looks to be made for the chair WITHOUT a joystick poking out on one side.
1,I gave it threes stars first because the storage case is advertised but did not get one came in a cardboard box from China. Then I down graded to 2 stars because the product was not an ATE product but at least it did the job. Product was not size right either had pieces of metal from the manufacturing process that I had to file down to properly fit.
1,didn't fit the vehicle it said it was for. ended up repairing original harness.
1,Now that I have had on my truck through the winter the lights have started to short out, I assume because it had moisture under the lense cover. Cost was great but I hoped for it to last less than a year!
1,3 clips broke after initial placement - sockets fall out after lifting by handle.
1,Good
1,Crap died very fast.. I'll go back to ddm tuning for all my hid needs...
1,Item was used and both nuts were missing.
1,The trailer store had me buy a differ kind that they said works better and will no crack in a couple of months
1,Doesn't really flex enough to work well. Spilling more now than before. Was a poor purchase.
1,The battery only lasted 1 year and has failed
1,So far so good all 20 work.... however after three months of use as license plate lights they started to fail
1,doesn't work.  I have several of these and this is te only one that I and the Honda dealer could not get to do the job.  stolen probably.
1,I have only had this light all of 4 days and it has now cost $100's in damage when it decided to fly off the car roof scraping and denting my roof before the cord snapped and it landed on the berm. Luckily it did not break out my back window. Now I'd like to know who's going to pay for the damages done to my car when product failed to meet expectations under proper use
1,Was using this to release lines for the transmission to cooler on my 2005 dodge ram 2500. Found this tool to be 100% worthless. I ended up freeing them and removing them with a small flat head screwdriver. Just for curiosity sake, I tried removing one with it after removing and reinstalling so rust wasn't an issue. Still didn't work. Not impressed.
1,The bulbs are what you get for the price. After installing I realized that these bulbs were inferior to the OEM ones already on the car. They were 6k however the output was pretty bad. It wasn't very bright and due to them being D2C, D2R, and D2S compatible fitment was off as well. Will not be purchasing these again.
1,Bought this gauge in Oct. 2013 and worked OK or as advertised for a month or so and then it started to become difficult, e.g., the numbers not showing up clearly and the pressure reading changing as you looked at it.  If your interested in a long lasting tire pressure gauge, check out Consumer Reports reviews or buy a brand name gauge like Michelin.  I've gone past the return date so it is now a waste of money.
1,This was exactly what I was looking for (a very wide-mouthed jug that can hold more than one oil change), and surprisingly, I've never seen another product like it.		I've always stayed away from using the bulky oil pan/container combos, because they look like they would make a mess, and are usually very low quality. Using one of these with a traditional open-faced oil pan is perfect, and creates very little mess. The mouth of the jug is even wide enough so that you don't need to use a funnel when transferring oil from the pan to the jug (so long as you're somewhat careful). If you've been using old milk jugs or something similar, then you know how much of a mess this can create due to spills, over-fills, and drippy funnels as you switch jugs. The extra wide mouth, and 12 quart capacity eliminates all of these problems.		I got this at a local autoparts store for about half of the current listed price on Amazon, and even then felt that I was over paying (but like I said, I've never seen another product like it, so I had no choice but to pay what they were asking). As other reviewers have mentioned, the plastic is very thin, and the cap does not go on very securely. I filled it with water when I got home in order to test it (better to have to clean up a water mess than an oil mess), and found that there were no leaks at all around the thin plastic's mold seam, but when I turned it upside down, as predicted, the area around the cap leaked heavily.		This shouldn't be a problem so long as you don't over fill it, but it would be nice if it were better quality. Just pick up any American-made gas container, and you will immediately see and feel the difference. These jugs are made with blown plastic, and probably cost less than $0.50 each to produce and ship, so it really is a shame that the price is so high.		Like I said, these jugs are very convenient, but due to the poor quality, and the fact that they will obviously get knocked around while doing what they were intended to do, I don't expect it to last longer than a year or two. Oh well..
1,UNACCEPTABLE.  I could start with the shipping blunder, but that likely isn't allowed so I'll skip that and go right to this.  I just finished installing this lift in my garage.  Immediately, I notice one side of lift is spewing fluid.  Time to call customer care.  I make the call and they request that I give them the serial number.  I went outside to grab it, and what do I discover?  The lift is literally leaking from every single component.  Apparently 2 of three leaks are slow whereas the one was a quick leak.  Teflon tape on the threads were used, all bolts fittings were torqued down tightly.  This is absolutely 100% unacceptable.  Upon further inspection  (while looking for serial) I spotted "Made in China".  So disappointed.  It's on Dannmar to make this right now.  Will update with what happens as I went from a slight problem to a major one with the addition of time.  The only weight the lift has right now is the weight of the arms 2' off the floor.  Check out the pics.  Not happy!		Customer service is now attempting to help me via troubleshooting.  I had to call them.  The arrogance on the phone is blatant.  Putting me on hold numerous times even cutting me off when I said I'm at the lift now....music.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  Total game playing.  This continues as the tech, not realizing I own my own shop and am extremely mechanically inclined starts playing more games.  The check valve and pressure release valve are 21mm and 22mm for a socket removal - I ask the tech what size socket is it...."umm, what?  There's no socket needed, just use a crescent wrench".  :/  I am getting more frustrated by the minute with this condescending behavior.  I admit, I lost my cool to this and used some expletives because when you step back - I'm troubleshooting a product with my time, with rude behavior, that cost over 2k, and being treated like - do you want help or not.  We go through some procedures, like adding teflon tape where the manual said not to, etc.  We make some progress on getting the leak at the motor to stop with the tape.  I explain some of the other issues I'm still having - like the lift not going up evenly and shuddering as well as coming back down - to me, the shuddering is obviously because of the transmission fluid cycling right back into the reservoir in reverse (where it should be holding).  More condescending comments come my way as I state it's shuddering ...."oh, did you put white lithium grease in the posts?"  No, I put it on the lift arms.  "Yeah, well is says that in the manual to do that".  Really?  Ok, I'll play along because they know as well as I do this is not because there wasn't white lithium grease, it's because the d#@# lift is defective.  That's the tone that is played constantly.  I explained I want my money back.  Answer is, well you will pay the shipping costs and a restock fee then.  This is what you folks are getting.  They are now going to reluctantly throw parts at me and waste my time figuring out what is wrong with their product (which is stated as designed in US, manufactured in China).  Part of this call was an effort to fix leaks at the posts and at the motor.  While we did nothing to the fittings at the quick disconnect, somehow Miguel thinks we've solved the issues.  I told him it takes time to see the leak.  His demeanor is, well it's not leaking now - must be fixed.  Just let me know if it's leaking later.  Again, I'm emphasizing this quality of service.  That was yesterday, today, of course!  New leaked transmission fluid.  I sent an email with pics.  I'm forced to waste time and play games.
1,If you tighten too much they break, the lens fall off, and wires brake inside
1,junk
1,doesn't work at all. I have tried to use it to remove oil from my mustang, truck, and fiat.. totally useless!
1,Nicely built but unit came without keys that's my reason for one  star  twice  in a  week
1,I ordered this because I read somewhere (not on Amazon) the weight rating was 250lbs. I weight 250 and by the time I stepped on the second step the vertical rails both bent and buckled. This might be OK for people up to 150lbs or rambunctious kids up to 100. This definitely is NOT DESIGNED FOR ADULT USE. If you used it in a very close to plumb position it might work a few times but if you lean it like you should a ladder at a 4:1 ratio it will fail and I would n't expect to get much use out of it. The finish and look are very nice but the rails are just way to thin and the treads "seem" to be installed with 3/16" thin wall roll pin in single shear.
1,no difference
1,Not sure they don't attach to my snap on meter they are just sitting in my box but they look nice
1,Order incomplete
1,Faded and became brittle in the sun in short order. Invest in a better product, this one is already garbage.
1,All the bolts were wayyyy to long. All were over an inch. Had to return.
1,The wax on the duster never goes away, nor do the streaks it leaves behind on the car; especially badly affected are windows.	I do not know how it gets so many + reviews....useless.
1,PRO:	1. Inexpensive		CONS:		1. The filter was not glued properly to the plastic	2. The pleats were weak and the fabric were loose.	3. IT DID NOT FIT MY VEHICLE.  I had to use the old OEM rubber gasket and replace the new thicker gasket.	4. The company claims it lasts only 12,000 miles (Hyundai recommends 30,000 miles)	5. Their customer service is horrible	6. Chinese-made quality		I will not buy again.  Spend an extra $3 for a genuine Hyundai Korean-made filter.
1,Wrong fit
1,Worked great after I went and got a new battery for it and stop working after 1 month
1,replaced stock radio antennae,  kills the radio data ability so the weather and station info doesn't work.		Would return if it cost more than 10 bucks... as it stands, i spent the money used this for a day and threw it out.  Don't know if its a knockoff trd antennae, i suspect so because i would imagine Toyota would sell parts that allow the operation of their equipment at the intended levels.
1,I previously owned the cable luber that only  has 1 thumb screw.  Could never get that one to work.  I thought this one would do the trick.  I could not get this one to work as well.		Either the aerosol lubricant would just spray out of the orifice where I put the straw in, or it would blow the straw off of the aerosol spray.  The one way I could lubricate the cable lines, was to disconnect one side of the cable line from the bike/ATV and use gravity-feed to slowly bring the lubricant into the cable liner.
1,These looked great! But the tape would not stick to my grill like it should have. Parts would, and parts wouldn't. The true test came I pulled the inserts of my grill with no real effort at all. There is no way they would have stayed on if I'd tried to drive with them. Returned them and ordered clip-ons.
1,Poor sound for the money
1,I purchased this with high hopes of being heard on the water. Unfortunately I waited to long to install it and now can not return it.  Finally had a chance the other day to go to lake and work on our pontoon. I was so excited to install this horn and be heard on the water. I can not stand a little "meep-meep" horn. While I was test wiring and figuring out a safe place to mount while tied off to some other pontoons I gave it a try. Well my friend tied off with his new pontoon ,(2017) Bennington 21 footer, decided to blow his factory electric horn. This is the same horn that can replace a standard marine horn on any pontoon console. Well guess what. After he tooted his horn I was like "WTF". I was amazed at how loud it was. Clearly my intentions to a have loud horn just got put to shame. I felt more like a kid that didn't get the "Hot Wheel" but instead got a generic toy does not work.
1,The low port adapter worked fine, I could not use their retrofit for the high side, I had to track one down at the parts store. My system was totally empty at the time. I aimed for the 80% of the r134a based off the capacity for r12.		The Gauge said I was way high on psi after 2 cans and not blowing cold. The compressor would turn on then off often which I assumed was not enough refrigerant but the Guage was high. I tracked down a set of real ac gauges from a neighbors friend. It confirmed the other gauge was off.
1,Getting better results with dish soap and a sponge.
1,you can't keep it on the seat when you get in or out what a pain.
1,The item did not fit
1,the installation went off without a hitch, but then i had to take the h/u out again to set up the USB connection that i forgot to install and the two prongs on the top that hold the top vents down snapped right off and now it just hangs there. this product is great if you don't plan on going back inside your dash again which was the plan, but you just never know.		on a positive note, it does fit very nicely inside the dash (provided the prongs don't break) and it looks like it came straight from the factory.
1,Only worked 2 times and if that's what you even want to call it.  Never sealed on the valve stem and the gauge needle fell off
1,too expensive
1,I used this on a Mazda 5 2.3 engine. It feels like a well built engine oil filter except that the center hole is a tad small making the center rib of the oil cap hard to push in. This will probably be my last use of a Wix engine oil filter for my Mazda 5. I'm going back to K&N.
1,Amazon doesn't have there vehicles for correct fitment as iv'e had two issues within the last 3 days This does not fit a 2015 traverse which it says it does
1,I make a point to replace the wipers every fall on my wife's Durango so she has a good set for the winter. I've purchased many different brands, and being partial to Michelin tires I decided to give these a try.		The plastic fittings at installation seemed iffy at best. They seem to be a hard brittle type plastic that caused pause in my decision, but I installed them anyway.		A month into thier use they fail to wipe the windshield clear on the passenger side, leaving a 3-4 inch wide streak at the middle of the blade. It was almost as if something was stuck underneath the blade but close inspection revealed nothing.		This morning, with 2 inches of snow on the windshield they decided they no longer wanted to stay on the vehicle..........		So I go into the garage and take apart the wiper on the 300, and forgot just how nicely the ANCO parts are made; nice firm fit, and they click on with authority.		The Michelin parts are JUNK. they never seemed to fit tight, and it's a perfect example of a once great company selling crap based on thier name.
1,The bar is way to rubbery, it is not dense enough or pliable enough to pickup anything off the paint.  I was using it with turtle wax detailing spray as the lube, and this was supposed to replace an old clay bar from several years ago and help me prep my truck for waxing.  The truck is kept outside, and gets used and abused, so there are plenty of contaminants on the paint, this clay bar did not remove anything.  The only reason I was able to finish waxing my truck is because my old clay bar still had enough life left in it to finish my truck.  This bar was of zero value.		Like others said, it is not a clay bar, it is more like silly putty or rubber bar.
1,I am not impressed with this horn, I cannot even really hear it inside of my own car, I cant imagine other drivers can hear it. If you are out of the car it is pretty loud but whatever frequency it is using does not penetrate vehicle cabins worth a darn, I should have gotten a bad boy i guess.
1,Bought these and when they came in one worked great super bright LEDs and looks awesome the other one worked only on white when I contacted the seller they told me I would have to pay for the LEDs to be returned to them for them to warranty them even though I've had them for only a day very poor customer service
1,Worked great for about a week till we had a week worth of rain. It was ok in the rain for two days then died completely -- likely short-circuited.  Very poor construction.  Glad it gave out so quickly because it would stink to get stuck with a $100 charger after the 30-day window passes. Perhaps I just got a bad unit, but you would think that the company would run some quality controls before shipping items out for this price.
1,Part fit fine, but one blew out in less than 6 months. Put Monroe shocks on my jeep, and they blew out in 3 months. Will never buy Monroe again.
1,The top pull rings break off. They are hard to place on the trailer hasps and remove. I have one on my side door to my trailer I can not even remove,
1,Didn't last long even though there was lots of jelly left.
1,Does not fit 2012 Mazda 5 as indicated in the Amazon.com product finder.  The correct one is Wix 24482 which is listed for 2013 and later Mazda 5 vehicles.
1,The sockets would not stay on the retainers they would just fall right back off this thing was very disappointing
1,Will not fit a 2010 Open Range 399BHS.
1,poor quality
1,Went to use and the adhesive had all leaked out in the bag.  Maybe the product could be okay but for me it was a complete waste of money.
1,If it does anything I don't feel it.
1,I bought this along with the 7424 thinking it was OEM and a proper accessory.  But I just thew them away once I got one of those Velcro backing plates.  Using an aftermarket Velcro backing plate opens up so many different options.  I just can't see myself buying bonnets and using this foam disc anymore.  I'm not even sure why one is included with the buffer.  Why not include a Velcro backing plate instead?  I bought 2 of them not knowing it would come with one also.  All 3 went right into the garbage can upon getting the Velcro plate.  Sry to repeat that so much...  cheers.
1,Purchased this item here on Amazon.  Took my 2015 Ford F-250 SD to the Florida Keys.  Started getting check engine light.  Panicked.  150 miles from nearest dealer.  Had auto parts store run the codes.  It was the gas cap.		Each time I empty the tank and refill, it takes 5 seconds for the starter to light the ignition.		Today I got the error in the photo.  "Check Fuel Cap"
1,Terrible results.  I got these thinking more expensive the better but I was wrong.  They grip the window so hard that they drag and leave water.  I discovered Biosch? and love them!  Quiet and smooth unlike these rain-x ones.
1,I ordered these to replace a pair of Fuel Fingerless gloves that I had lost. I bought the XL/XXL size, but was shocked when I tried to put them on and could barely get them over my hands. This was not my experience with the last pair I owned. I thought that the pair I received may have been mislabeled, but I went to a brick and mortar store and tried on an identical pair, and they were extremely tight also. I don't know if their manufacturing process has changed or what, but I these run really, really small. I guess they expect them to stretch out A LOT.		I decided to steer clear of these gloves.
1,Moisture  in light right after installation  After sitting outside for a couple days
1,Longer life my behind!  Within 1 week using these wipers for three drives that included some rain for maybe a maximum of 3 total hours, already this wiper is completely skimming over and not wiping in the center area of the blade.  Naturally, the streak it leaves is smack in my field of vision.  I have initiated a warranty replacement with Bosch, so I will come back and update if the replacement is any better.  I'm baffled, smack under where the bracket connects to the blade is where it's not wiping - that's like the exact opposite of what would be expected.  The blade on the other side of the car, which is a 21A model, seems to be working great.  There is no leaf or anything stuck under the blade - I park inside at home and at work.  I swear, you cannot get good wiper blades these days!  Nothing seems to last.  The factory blades go at about 20-30K miles and then after that it's just replacement after replacement after replacement, even if you use factory blades, it seems (which are typically made by a 3rd party that also sells in the aftermarket under well-known brand names).  Given that, for the first time I tried Bosch - notably the most expensive - and this... ug!
1,WILL NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, DUPLI-COLOR PRODUCTS' ARE NOT WHAT THEY ARE INTENDED FOR AND ONLY A BODY SHOP CAN DO THE CORRECT PAINT JOB.....
1,Well.. lasted about 300miles and its back to being an open. Checked all my wires for a short and there is none. Checked the rear diff spline and its got teeth. Got the part showing resistance and now it is a open pin to pin. Guess I will buy another one. SMH
1,The dipstick tube is too large to fit into the block. When it arrived and wouldn't fit I called Amazon and was sent a replacement. It didn't fit either.	I ended up getting one from a local auto parts store which not only fits perfectly, it looks very nice.	After two tries and two failures, I bought a different product.
1,Don't think it said it would ship directly from Tiawan. Waited longer than expected and product is not worth using. For the $10.50 pricetag you can imagine how cheap the stuff is that showed up. Very disappointed....need to read the ad better next time.
1,Was not the right clip for 05 jeep liberty, or maybe it's just faulty design becuase it doesn't lock the fender in between the clips.
1,They lasted less than a year on my 2009 Honda Element.  Apparently they are ridiculously soft and they leave a crazy amount of brake dust.
1,I liked this set until a hole began to wear into the drivers side from normal use. I drove about 20k miles on the mat before it began. I am now attempting to get a replacement from the manufacturer.
1,I do not see that anytihng is better.
1,Not worth for money....it will break very easily... Color is good but the quality is bad.....
1,Good enough for the price, but not bright enough..	Also, a wrong product for my Toyota Camry 2015 - had troubles installing, somehow managed to, but eventually had to trash it.
1,the programmer was very slow, it froze a lot, had many issues. simply its way too cheep for its price
1,Strut boot for RX 2004 Lexus part unusable. Throw away item .Does not fit  the Lexus 2004 Rx 330 shock replacement. Do not buy.
1,Turds. They aren't very bright and light flickers while on.
1,Junk
1,This is more a review of the Amazon fitment listing. It clearly said it would fit the 2012 1900 Stratoliner but after removing the old battery I offered up this battery and it is clearly not the same size. Mine is a YT14B-BS series and the one shipped is a ytx20-bs. Clearly the fitment tables are incorrectly showing the size to be compatible.
1,Can't really say whether it is good or bad. I keep it in my travel car kit. I always reach for RainX around the garage.
1,Blew a 5 pack of fuzes in my Jeep and Truck trying to get it to work again. Very upset this works as a temporary product then breaks anything it connects too.  It's not worth the headache for the price.
1,Poor quality print. Didn't even use on my car.
1,take my review with a grain of salt. it seems to be missing the flat plate that is supposed to go on the back of the chain when your compressing the new master link to ensure that the chain pin doesn't end up pushed through. the press plates holes also had a bur or something that led to catching on the the chain pin. had a very difficult time ruining 2 master links. to be fair, i'm not a mechanic.
1,It absolutely does not work .
1,Two bulb didn't work.
1,Look nice but wouldn't work in the sockets it says it does. Had to get lights from a lighting company.
1,When I purchased these wipers the Amazon vehicle checker said that they would fit my brand new 2015 pickup truck.  Now I just checked back and the same vehicle checker says they will not fit my truck and it is too late to return the 2 wipers that I purchased so I'm out $40 and I'm pi__ed!
1,Great deal from Amazon. Just a little upset something from a US company like AC Delco and the water pump is not made here. Thanks again Amazon. Best deal on the internet.
1,do not fit 04 ram 2500
1,I bought this antenna for my 2011 Ram 1500.  The FM reception loss was instant and I don't recommend this antenna.  I put the original equipment antenna back on and immediately and the FM signal came back.  Waste of money and I'll paint my original equipment antenna black. Win some and loose some.
1,I expected that this would be the bracket that attaches to the window.  Instead,it's supposed to slide into the bracket on the window, which has come off my windshield.  It's of no value to me.  Delivery was prompt, and these are metal, so if it's what you need, it should be fine.
1,I suppose if you're heading on a long trip and want/need the storage space, this would be ok but for me, it's HUGE and looks awkward. It's certainly not a bag I'd keep on the bike at all times as I was looking for. I have a Yamaha V-Star 1100 Classic (which is a pretty good sized bike) but this bag overpowers the overall look. In addition, it doesn't really come with a way to secure it to your existing luggage rack that I can find. There are velcro straps to attach it to the rear seatback but as others have said, it sits too high to use confidently and moves around very easily back there. If I could return it, I would but i've been too lazy to ship it back and now I'm past my return window so I guess it'll sit in the garage.
1,Received quickly from Amazon.  Installed and life was good.  First water on the windshield and I had never seen a cleaner windshield with water on it.  These lasted less than 4 months.  Now I get streaks, and on the larger Honda wiper, it doesn't leaves huge areas with water if you are driving.  The OEM wipers had lasted and were great for over two years. Two stars as they did work and work very well at first.  Minus three stars as the life expectancy was way shorter than even cheapo OEM wipers.
1,Product below xpectation
1,<div id="video-block-R3EERLOSXQ5ZTW" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EJYEHMGmS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aE5tmGXzS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;So very disappointing. Whoever thinks this horn is loud must have little more than a bicycle bugle for their stock horn. Before installing, I recorded a video of my 2011 Toyota Tacoma horn from the driver's seat with the door open. Then I installed the Stebel Nautilus and recorded that. The Stebel is higher pitched, which I don't know if that's better or worse, but it seems quieter. From the other reviews, I really was expecting attention-getting, louder-than-stock sound. I certainly won't pay $42 for a horn that is quieter than stock. I will be returning to Amazon. Good thing I didn't cut up my stock connections as the instructions said to do.
1,In installed this on my bmw x5 and it did not read for the reset.
1,These are so incredibly small, definitely not worth putting on my big Ram 1500.  I expected them to be twice this size.  See picture
1,Over rated power capability and way over priced for a generator likely capable of delivering much less than 1500 watts at 60 Hz and at or above 110 V. Don't be fooled.
1,I ordered these to replace the two I bought on "mark down" at Walmart some years back. My husband put the new ones on today. While installing the first one, the black piece with the grommets for tightening tore.  While installing the 2nd one the whole black piece w/grommets came off.  I realize I didn't pay alot for these, but I didn't expect them to tear that easily either.  I thought Bell Automotive would be a good brand. I am very disappointed. If it weren't for the time/effort my husband took to install these, I would return them for a refund and order a different product.  (The only reason I replaced the ones I had on is because they were starting to fade out.  I am very disappointed with the quality of this product.
1,Didn't fit my 99 Pontiac Grand Prix GT like it said
1,The starter is installed and working, but I am not satisfied as the part I purchased was advertised as a Nipon Denso, but what I received was a TYC.  What is a TYC.  I feel like this was mis-advertising as I purchased a know brand of Nipon Denso
1,I have been using kensun for years and have recommended countless friends and family to the brand and purchased a half dozen times. However, the quality isn't what it used to be :( Twice I have been sent bulbs that are supposed to be 5k temp and they end up working for a week or two and then start turning pink. I've had very long lasting quality in the past (over two years on one set) that never changed color or had issues. I've ordered recently this past September of 17 and have already had two sets start turning colors after only a month or so of use. Kensun even identified them as defective based on the description of the problem. The builds aren't even consistent, different color wires and gauge of wires from shipment to shipment. To say I am disappointed after being loyal so long is an understatement.		Kensun customer service is great and is the reason I give any stars. I'm forced to look elsewhere as simply receiving free replacements is just a pain due to installation on my particular vehicle. It's just a hassle to keep cracking the hood open and removing the headlights to gain access to the bulbs every time one fails in a VERY short period of time.
1,This product claims it holds up to 350 pounds of weight. Not so. We professionally installed and the first time we used it the hitch bent. It could have been a disaster on  the highway. We would not recommend it to anyone. I would have sent it back but we threw the box away and now I will have to pay someone to remove in order to install a new one... NOT HAPPY
1,Lasted two months then died. Try a different brand.
1,I had a similar experience as other low ratings describe.  This tape is just not sticky.  At all.  I was careful to clean and prep the metal surface with an alcohol wipe, wait on it to be bone dry, and apply the tape carefully without touching the adhesive surface.  Tape simply falls off.  Disappointing as I've had very good luck with other 3M mounting tape for other applications.
1,Package came with extra tape on the box. Thought it may have been coming open from shipping... nope it was already installed once in its life. Had to clean out the air filter as it was used. Looked like some had used a food saver to reseal the bag for the air filter... I see what you did there! I do love the product, but hate that is was used purchased at new price... I gave it one star because it was used. The fitment was about 3 star I have to mod a few parts on it to make it fit better.
1,Bends kinda cheap works tho
1,DO NOT waste your money on this device. This device suffers from poor hardware engineering and lack of options with the app. The 100mw of power isn't practical in most environments.
1,To small and did not fit the 150cc GY6 output shaft
1,Fits poorly
1,I bought these bulbs 2 years ago and the tip of the bulb Burns Out for no reason at all very disappointed don't take a chance on buying these they don't last the tip of the bulb  melts like it gets too hot
1,Doesn't fit Infiniti M37
1,This does not fit my 95 Ford Ranger tailgate! Was not worth the money or time to send back.
1,Installation instructions are wrong, Put the metal brackets on the truck first then screw them to the shield. Doing it the way the instructions tell you causes breakage.
1,Don't buy this! the convertor is a piece of junk! might last a year if lucky, Company won't guarantee it a day past when you bought it in the month, I hooked up to my trailer the other  day about 11 days past year ago purchase, which I didn't even install it for a few weeks after buying and they said tough luck! poor way to do business Tow Ready! I probably only used the trailer 4 or 5 times last year, pretty expensive at over $ 63.94 a year. My trailer had all new led lights and wiring and I have had other people use it with no problems and all connections are perfect on the truck, just one dead brake light wire coming out of the convertor. I bought this from e-trailer and I don't know why they show good reviews because their is a whole list of people that have said their convertors went bad after a year, two, or three. I will never buy this Tow ready crap again! not that rich !!!
1,I was so unimpressed with this and the CURT 5702 bracket that I discarded them in favor of mounting my trailer connector in the bumper.  It just looked very sloppy and the connector hung too low under the back of the truck.  The connector was crooked and there was just something about having the connector bracket held on with a hose clamp that I could not live with.
1,WRONG PART....shocked I wasn't getting the "This part won't fit your car" notice at the top of page before I ordered it. Probably a good filter, just too big and too late as I tore the pkg. open to install it. sigh.
1,Not 9" shank like listing states. And for those who will say the shank is not the 2" square tubing that goes into the receiver, Google the definition of SHANK.	The 2" ball also has a Shank. Its the threaded part of the ball the nut goes onto.
1,Piece of garbage mini CD with the drivers blew up in my disk drive and totaled it. Cheap crap.
1,Warps after 4 months of use. I thought AC Delco was a good brand? I used ac delco pads too.
1,I put on my quad but it doesn't hold a charge unless started weekly.
1,Used with my cordless drill to try and buff my counters and cabinets after applying Jubilee kitchen wax. The pad just made a mess as it was breaking down into dozens of lint balls and this was on a super smooth counter-top.  The Jubilee kitchen wax awesome, just had to buff by hand.
1,I purchased the amber bulbs for my side markers. They are just as bright, if not brighter then stock incandescent bulbs. Will buy again if needed.		UPDATE: The dome on on of the bulbs fell off, and the other bulb flickers non-stop. Disappointed as these were in a vehicle I rarely drive.
1,Extremely disappointed by this purchase. I accidentally ordered the "2 pack" for 8.50 or so, instead of the "pack of 6" which happened to be 7.50. I didn't figure it would be a problem because I thought I was getting more than the other. HOWEVER, the more expensive one is just two applicators....for MORE money than the 6 pack. Needless to say I will be contacting the seller. Will post an update if anything comes of it.
1,So my lifted Chevy on 37s with a 350 5.7 motor with no cats true duals straight back out was just too loud so I got this and welded it in middle ways back and omg it sounds like a Honda Civic. Its quieter than a stock quiet flow muffler. I was hoping for a deep tone or something. Guess Ill have to get Cherry bombs
1,Arrived with defective plastic bottle, which makes this borderline useless if you're hoping to use this as a brake bleeder.		The bottle wasn't broken, it was simply manufactured incorrectly. As in, the lid won't fit. I e-mailed the company and was told that they were aware of the problem, but they refused to replace it, instead inviting me to order a new bottle and lid for about $10.		No thanks. Steer clear. There are plenty of cheaper alternatives out there, perhaps run by a company that has a clue about customer service.
1,Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't work.
1,Did not work on the 4 series as shown in the picture. The parking sensor is still blocked and it always shows an error. Tried every position to avoid the sensor. Does not work!!!!
1,The part of the pouch that fits between the faring to hold the pouch in place is so thick, it would pull the screws out from the faring. Further, it is very thick and not bendable. This is a very cheap replica of the real thing. But the real thing.
1,Unable to pull a small dent on aluminum
1,Completely useless to me
1,Horrible !! I can't believe I paid 40 bucks for these crappy, cheap fake carbon fiber plates. One of them snapped and plastic pieces went everywhere, even into the skin of my hands. The second one snapped as well....useless. The dealer plastic frames are better than this crap. DONT BUY !!!
1,I spent countless hours on trying to get this to work. I even bought the T-harness to make the install easier. The T-harness only hooks up the remote car starter part of it. I was under the impression that it would hook up everything just to find that it doesnt. I also bought a bypass for the anti-theft system. I put this system in but couldn't find the power lock wires that I needed to. So I went ahead and figured I could go without the locks. This is where it got interesting. After spending hours and getting everything hooked up,I pushed the start button. The Trailblazer started........and shut off. Tried it again and the same thing happened over and over. Well went to the computer and found that the $120.00 bypass module I got needed to be reset because it was giving me a code. Huh,no problem,went through the list to reset it and got to the next to last step. You need to hit the lock/unlock button. Remember me saying I didn't wire the locks. I went back hooked the lock wires from the remote starter to the bypass module. Went through the reset list and nothing happened. After a hour of trying to wire this and that I came to realize that it must have to go through the anti-theft system itself and I couldn't find those wires to wire it up. I called support and left messages to which I still haven't heard anything yet to date. I emailed support and still haven't heard anything yet to date. All in all,I spent $240.00 for complete junk that I counldnt get to work. I also spent hours on the computer doing research because their directions suck and aren't clear. If you have no expereince in automobiles or wireing STAY AWAY from this crap. Its nothing more than a headache. Remember nothing is universal!
1,The stereo is perfect and works perfect. With that said, it replaced a 1 year old one that failed and they refused to warranty it because it was just outside of the warranty period. It's not a well built stereo and I don't know how long this one will last. The company won't stand behind it as well.
1,Pros: it comes with both pins.	Cons: I have had this for 3 months in upstate New York and it is already very rusty
1,Failed after 8 months.  I actually ended up makeing my own double relay out of OEM relay parts for my VW Jetta TDI and fans.  These seem to go every year or so unless you spend big bucks on OEM.
1,Didn't fit in the 8mm push rivet holes easily. I broke two before I could get one to stay in and lock.  Material is also super pliable so removal essentially deforms the push rivet into failure.
1,Rotors are NOT black coated like the picture. Mine came all gray metal color. I needed them today so I didn't want to have to send them back, so I went ahead and used them. I'm NOT happy that they aren't black on the hubs. The seller needs to put the "ACTUAL" picture of the product on the sale page. The current picture is misleading. Also, they were Made in China. WTH? I ordered the AC Delco brand so that I'd get quality parts and not cheap China crap. Next time, I will probably NOT buy these.
1,I bought this jack for my Jeep because of the red and black color scheme shown in the picture. The jack i received was grey and black.
1,Not even close to fitting like it says. Holes do not line up and does not fit around fuel fill and vent tubes. Was suppose to bolt right in with existing bolts but new bolts were sent. These will not work to to it having a square tube frame.
1,The pre 09 gas cans do not need to be compliant nor retrofitted
1,It's terrible when your lights are on or you turn the light on you can't even tell which light it is the picture becomes indistinguishable spend some money get a better one
1,I have another battery booster (Century brand) that I bought in 2001 and still works great. I wanted another one for my Prius as it is easy for a valet to leave the car on and drain the small battery that powers the electronics and allows the car to start. After 6 months I found it would no longer take a charge and it is on its lowest charge state setting even after 8 hours of charging.		The air compressor actually works better than my other 12 volt compressor only one but that was when it was new. Now it is junk and I need to pull out the NiCad battery so it can be disposed of properly. The compressor also adds considerably to the bulk of the booster so if you want something compact to fit in the trunk or under a car seat this is not the one to get.		Thought with the Black and Decker that it would be better than average in quality but the reverse is true. Bought a PEAK brand for $55 to replace the B&D and will see how well it holds up. As with any rechargeable battery it is a good idea to recharge it at least every other month whether it has been used to start a car or not. Deep discharges are tough on battery life and many chargers will not recharge a battery when it drops below 20% of its capacity though good units have a control to keep this from happening. The PEAK battery booster has an alarm function and will start beeping when it needs to be recharged which is a great feature for this type of out of sight out of mind device.		I hate to be adding junk to the local landfill much less dealing with the toxic aspects of cadmium in batteries so having this Black and Decker fail so quickly is doubly irritating. When you need it the most - i.e. your car battery is dead, that is when you find that this booster is also dead and you are out of luck.		Always a good idea to have a set of jumper cables just in case but the boosters are much handier and work great in situation where it may not be possible to get another car into position with its battery. With a booster it is a more idiot proof procedure with just two cables to connect and not having to worry about the sequence of the 4 connections as with jumper cables. Jumper cables may be a better choice if your car is outdoors in subfreezing conditions (can store the booster in the house though) or for very hot climates as baking at 160 degrees in a car out in the Arizona sun is going to greatly shorten the battery life.
1,Misleading ad. Do NOT fit Del Sol inner fenders
1,Looks pretty good for a month or two.  The "powder coating" is bubbling and chipping off.  I don't know what the heat rating is on the coating they use but I think I could use a can of high temp generic crap from Walmart that would last longer.  Maybe I just got a bad one, I messaged them so we'll see if they can make it right
1,wrong one no refunds available
1,no electric item  and just plastic
1,I have been using EBC on my cars for years and always liked their stopping power and light dust but when I purchased my latest car I decided to try out the rotors. Big mistake! So far I have had to turn them three times in a six month period because of warping. I have taken my car to the dealer and another ASE shop and they both are telling me that it's the rotors. Now I have to buy new rotors and EBC told me to get bend because I didn't have them installed at the dealer. So in my opinion, if your going to go with EBC just buy the pads.		I with I had more hands so I could give these rotors four thumbs down.
1,Leaks like crazy when connected to can. I think mine was missing a gasket.
1,Didn't fit in my trailer hitch for some reason
1,This isn't even the right part for the bumper on Toyota Corolla Matrix...as is advertised....so buyer beware...looks like import junk that won't work with OEM applications on your vehicle
1,The cap leaks while driving. Not just a little but as if it didn't have a cap on at all!
1,Did not fit
1,Bought wrong items
1,doesnt work good for galv pipe used for compressed air, used teflon tape and no leaks
1,poor alignment ad stabililty when making the flare. The Tube will slip when making the flare. then it boke.. poor quality
1,no son  iguales
1,I have purchased and installed wipers on a myriad of vehicles over the past 40 years. These are NOT some of the best. First, as so many have mentioned, the plastic attachment parts are poorly constructed and on J wiper arms the arm is now extended at an angle to the windshield and higher above the surface than the OE blades. Second, the wiper construction seems rather flimsy, the spring being rather floppy. At high speeds these design defects may result in the blade skimming above the water in heavy rains. Frankly, I am amazed that these are marketed as better than average blades. I should have known better. Buy Bosch or any manufacturer used by European or major Japanese manufacturers for OE blades. Do not buy these unless you just want to be disappointed. The price with promotions (which seem continuous) is relatively low, and the quality is similarly low. I could not even find these on the ACDelco website. I assume they are discontinuing them and that is the reason for the promotions.
1,These red LED's are useless. I thought they would be at least as bright as the standard non-LED bulb that comes with most cars but they aren't even close. In the dark the light itself is clearly red, but not enough light projects out to even get a good look at a map or something you dropped on the floorboard.		I had pictures to show how dim they are, but since amazon refused my first review (even though nothing violated the review guidelines) I no longer have the pics.
1,Could be me, but I can't get this thing to work properly. It's obviously working because it lights up but it doesn't reset nuisance codes for my car....
1,I ordered two bulbs. One of them was loose in the socket and turned the bulb off when installing it. It also was not as bright as I thought it would be.
1,Didn't feel any difference in power or smoothness in the engine running
1,Just got them and right off the bat you can tell they are not LEDs. You can see an incandescent bulb right inside the housing. False advertising. Problem is I need them for this weekend so I can't turn around and send them back. Looks like I'm stuck with these.
1,Aluminum, very soft. Not heavy duty at all. You do not want to over tighten the nut. I stripped my first one and ruined it. I also noticed that the fit of the nut on the threads of the stem is very loose. Not much thread engagement which is why it stripped so easy. Definitely would not ever buy again.
1,Don't buy this to line your truck bed. Pay for professional lining. Two coats in and my truck bed is still splotchy and poorly protected.
1,It look cheap and feels cheap but it seems to work, however, I did not feel safe using them without something else that was solid behind one of the other wheels.		Sure does not look heavy duty at all!	Maybe good enough for a lawn mower but not for a car.
1,Nice welds  but doesn't fit a 5 lug trailer tire as advertised. Not sure why they would use the carriage bolts they used either. The supplied bolts will destroy your wheels if you mount with them. Now I'm on a wild goose chase to find 1/2 inch carriage bolts with a 20tpi pattern and not having any luck. Unfortunately I've already mounted this to the side of my camping trailer and the holes can't be undone. Even if I do find the bolts I need to modify the holder to fit my 5 lug pattern.
1,Shipping was fast mainly becasue you pay $5+ for it which is half its price. The quality seems poor and the light output is weak and BLUE. The main goal I bought it for is getting a white light not night club blue. I bought some more from other manufacturer here and they were really bright white and have way more light output than these garbage. I'll return them or giving them away to some friends.
1,I had really hoped these would be great. I bought them to keep near my pistol belt at home in case I ever need to respond to trouble. Unfortunately they fit VERY SMALL! I normally wear medium or large mechanics-style or latex gloves, so I got large in these. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Fingers are way too thin. Also, the pad on the palm is very thick. If I try to hold my double-stack magazine pistol, my hand barely wraps around it. It would not give me confidence in my ability to hold and control my weapon.
1,This is a fragile plastic item that is easily destroyed by automatic car washes.
1,Bright clean white uniform light.  Slightly larger than original halogen lamps.  So had to disassemble some parts in my car (2012 Prius).  Fan does make a slight noise.  Not audible when the car is on.		Update May 2016:		One of the lights failed after just 400 hours.  Too long.  Had to disassemble fixtures etc.  to install
1,Slow af
1,Shameful design, ridiculously fragile, and insanely overpriced. Only reasonable alternative is to buy "Rigid Eye Pulley" from home improvement store ($0.75). Pulley is also available from Amazon: "National Hardware 3213BC". Warn now sells expensive pulley kits (e.g. 84526) that is an alternative to this poor design.
1,Didn't work...still let oil into intake...I did away with this style and used earlier style cover with external pcv valve....fixed oil consumption... usually very happy with AC delco parts...maybe I just got a bad one...
1,Installation was a breeze, and I do like the nice clean look of a solid wiper blade. Plus charity is a great thing.		However, the pink ribbon doesn't make up for how bad these blades sounded when I first installed them. Great loud squeal every time they are used, unless my windshield is soaked. Sometimes I would let my visibility suffer just so I didn't have to hear the screeching. I was hoping they would get better with age, as the dirt softened up the blade, but it actually got worse. Need new wipers before it rains again.
1,Doesn't last at all. Finger stitching tore right from the beginning.
1,Buy something else if you plan on working on anything newer than 2007. Had I known this I never would have purchased it in the first place.		I purchased the battery conductivity tester right after it went out of warranty. After I got it, I found out that it wouldn't work with this scanner (?!). I contacted customer support, and was told it had to be sent in to them to find out what was wrong with it. It then had to have the PCB replaced-another $180.00 for the replacement of the PCB-plus shipping.		Total POS	Mine's for sale; Look elsewhere for something better.
1,Flat mirrors...really! Put some convex mirrors in this kit you jerks then we can talk about more stars for ya.
1,Good
1,They do not work on mopar vehicles
1,Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out. It's title is true. I do not know why some give five stars to this product is very difficult to use it. might not have used it and lie so bad that confuse buyers because they believe that having five stars is a good product but it is not true .. I recommend the pva Chomu. I have one for seven years and works extremely well.
1,if a two piece seal sticks out more than 0.01 inch past te ends of the bearing cap and block then it will certainly ovate and not seal when it's not being energized (the seal will leak when the engine is off). I did not learn this till after i replaced this seal on my jeep and it only leaked when the engine was off, draining the oil galleries above it. go get a mopar part from chrysler. it's actually a few dollars cheaper, and seals even when the engine is off.
1,Even diluting this stuff as little as possible, it still froze up in -10F. The claims are that it will hold up until -26, but nope. Not even close.		Meanwhile, I paid around $2 for some windshield solution at a gas station that worked flawlessly. So at this price, you're FAR better off buying pre-diluted.
1,Didn't fit 4runner
1,100% PURE JUNK - I have no clue how this product has rated a 4 1/2 star. This is pure plastic, with a chrome finish. Cracked two of the three just taking them out of the packaging. Cracked the 3rd one putting it on my car. Junk Junk and More JUNK. But then again, its made in China.
1,put it on my Road King and it came loose driving down the road with a strong side wind which could of caused a problem
1,very cheaply made
1,Too big to fit into my 2001 Softtail. These lights are thicker than the stock lights. Made it impossible to reinstall the mounting rings. After leaving this review I was contacted by the seller and offered money to remove it. I refused and feel that being paid to remove a negative review undermines the Amazon review process. Pass on this one.
1,Only came with 3 plugs. Who has a 3cylinder Lexus huh?
1,Junk ...oil burning smell ....discovered oil covering the bottom of my Honda...its leaking from the filter..... never again...read the same story here by many many  other people..this could have caused a fire or worse cost me my engine !
1,Listing said they'd work in my 2007 Mercedes Benz c230 sport, and while the fit ok, within a driving cycle or two, they caused the engine to throw 3 error codes. The codes indicated a bad mass airflow sensor and 2 bad O2 sensors. This shouldn't be the case with a motor that has less than 70k miles on it, so I checked that all sensors were ok, reset the codes and awaited to see if it happened again. It did, again within a few driving cycles, so I replaced these with Mann filters (c3698/3-2) also purchased on Amazon and I haven't had any issues since (2 months). The Fram appear to be far less substantial and of thinner, lower quality materials. I've never had an issue with Fram in domestically made vehicles in the past, but won't use them in my MB in the future.
1,Junk Dim no good threw it away
1,Hood roundel turned yellow in one week. Steering wheel roundel is undersized. Trunk and wheels are not yellow yet but, they are not in direct sunlight like the hood. Too bad. They looked really good. Shopping for replacements.
1,Poor fit for out 2016 Chevy Colorado. The pre-drilled hole on the driver's side did not match up with one on the hood.  Hard to drill another.  Also, didn't like having to slide a metal clip on both sides of the hood, not sure the "protective" tape was adequate to protect the hood from being scratched. Color is nice.  This was a present for our son's new truck. Wouldn't recommend this product.
1,Bad, trash
1,pretty large for my application on a van. showing mechanical issues. I converted a chevy express van into a urban camper van and used this fan.  At first I thought it was great because it has a built in rain cover, but since I was using this as a 'stealth cargo van' I didn't like how much extra bulk it added to the fan.  Especially for the fact that I mounted this right in the back of the van which was over our bed, I think this was a bad position because it makes it all the more apparent just how large this thing is.  I do like the remote much more than the one from fanstastic fan, taht are similar to the button style  found on this fan unit itself.  But the buttons on the fan unit while durable, I do not like. First off, it's difficult to find the buttons in the dark.		Mine developed a hum to it at slow speed so I've in contact with the manufacturer now.  Which is not something I'm looking forward to pulling out of my van..  Anyway, I wish I purchased the fantastic fan instead.
1,Passenger liner does not stay in place.  The sides of both liners do not lay flat.  I hit them getting in with my feet.  Once they bend up, it takes forever for them to lay down again
1,They ddnt even work???
1,They appear bright as heck, but so does a cell phone's LED if you point it at your face!  Planned on using these at high speed off road... no way!  Lumens mean nothing unless focused.  This is a flood light that would be good for under 20 mph in the woods.  They barely light my neighbor's house 100' away!  Lame, next step will be the high dollar ones with great distance reviews.  Tried to cut corners but it didn't pay.
1,These are cheap materials and they break easy. The option to mount in the handle bars is tough because the screw doesn't tighten all the way.
1,Did not fit 2013 Road Glide lights.  Waste of money.
1,It did not fit in my 2009 Honda Fit !!!
1,Most state parks in Florida now have anti-backflow devices screwed into the end of the spigots.  These anti-backflow devices have a small pin (probably to hold the spring) that sticks out of the middle.  The first time you try to screw the Valterra regulator onto one of these, the pin will crush the concave screen on the Valterra regulator, which deforms the rubber seal washer causing it to leak profusely.  If you do get one of these for use in Florida, be sure to use it somewhere later in the water line run, not at the park spigot.
1,Not as long as OE. Can create a problem on bottom portion of bumper and the splash guard. Fit fine on the top end but had to fish my old ones out of the trash to finish the underside of my bumper cover.
1,I have these installed on my 2014 GMC.  Initially they worked OK, nothing special, they did the job for a short time.  Since that short time of working OK when first installed, they started streaking in one direction.  When you turn the wipers on they clean well on the first pass, the second they streak leaving poor visibility giving you seconds of  clear visibility, this continues with each pass of the wiper blades.  I have cleaned the wiper blades and the windshield many times in hopes of curing the problem but nothing seems to help, the wipers look to be in good shape with very little wear and no missing rubber.		They have been on my truck all summer, and in the end they are rather disappointing and I won't be buying again.
1,The description, is not a direct fit for the opening in the fixture; the unit is expensive and it doesn't last long like as you should expect, in the top of that you need to incorporate a big resistor in the circuit to avoid the rapid blinking, it has a premature failure in few LED's, but it gets to the point that, is better to stay with incandescent, or get a different brand.		Overall stay away from this product.		Respectfully: A. M.
1,Barely has any resistance to hold glasses in. It doesn't lock down or anything.
1,bulbs went out in 2 weeks and had to modify them to fit my 880 pigtail
1,13 months old just off warranty, and now grinding. Yes they were installed correctly using a new axle nut with a torque wrench. Total junk.
1,I would never recommend these lights. They are very cheap and barely attached to the surface I was setting them on. They also fried my upfitter fuse in my truck which I had replaced for $100.
1,This digital tire gauge drains battery even if you are not using it.	I checked my tires once a month, but, I already have to change battery about once per year.	The gauge still use power to memoris the pre-setting of tire pressure. come to think about it, the	pre-set memory is useless if you have 2 different cars. (Because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting). The 2032 lithiumX2 battery is not cheap, I expect it should last at least 5 years.
1,Overcharged snowmobile  battery and ruined it beware
1,They lasted an entire month! Garbage
1,poorly made copy of original  fell apart before I could install it had to throw it in the trash !
1,The visor, I receiver, fit my 2014 Pries well. The quality was there but the visor had defective distortion bubbles in it. I will ship back and reorder . Hopefully the new one will have a clear view plastic so I can upgrade this post.
1,The liquid Collinite is by far better
1,I would not recommend these bulbs at all. I do a lot of 3 am driving five days a week, and for the money I expected more.
1,The description for these handlebars are for a completely different product. There just regular handlebars.
1,Don't waste your money!
1,At first these seem to work great, then after some use the light got hot enough to apparently melt the solder and the whole thing has started falling apart but only one of them, the other is fine still.		I am trying to include a photo but it's amazing that this is somehow supposed to be a functioning light for a vehicle and it falls apart under normal operation.		Useless.
1,The description distinctly states that this pouch is perfect for storing the Battery Tender. Really?! I've never seen a Battery Tender that was less than 2" tall. The picture shows the pouch's long sides, and states the long sides, but doesn't tell you that the pouch is only about 1 1/2" to 2" tall.
1,I love the look of these and they apply very easily however, I bought 4, lost 1, so I bought another 4 and since then have lost 2 more.  I don't drive aggressively and drive on smooth roads.  These just don't hold on to the rim very well.		Update!!		Bought 4 lost 1. Bought another 4 so I would have 3 extras and a total of 7. This was just over a year ago and tonight I've just lost another and i have no clue where. So I am officially down to 3 remaining of the 8 I purchased. Ive just ordered a new set by another manufacturer. I will no longer be a customer of TuningPros.
1,Got for wifes 2016. Too bluey. Put the halogens back in.
1,I'm not sure if i picked some duds out of the bag, but everytime i close and reopen my door, i notice that the panel separates a little more. These don't seem to be gripping like the originals did. I have 25 to choose from, maybe some of them will work better than others.
1,This is absolute crap. For installation, there was no snap in feature but only double sided tape. I ended up returning these
1,I ordered this and a 20" light bar, the 20" light bar was WAY to small to fit in here. Ot left about 1.5" open on each sides to where the light bar actually is. The distance between point A and B is actually near 23". I could install a 20" light bar here, with a bushing and a longer bolt, but it would look rather funny. Not happy that I wasted money on a light bar that will not fit into here. I had to re-order a 21" light bar
1,didn't fit my 2006 ford f 150 even though it was advertised as fitting
1,too hard to mount on rim not what I needed
1,Installed this in my 94 Pontiac Trans AM GT, Worked Fantastic, Got rid of my issues and my 2 weeks of trying to solve my issues. Then coming back home from a 3 hour drive a year after install, system does same issue, tried again replace plugs thinking its a fouled plug, nope, it was again the Opti. i though this was ment to fix the issue of stock problems. Well, It was just a month or so out of warranty with now help from MSD Performance Corp.
1,These products promise a lot and hard to tell if they even work! US fuel is usually great except when you use Rogue merchants that sell low grade gas. I use this on my Honda and did not notice any change to performance, leaving me to wonder if I just threw money down the drain. I prefer and recommend changing fuel filter often and use Shell V grade gas if no use medium range gasoline to keep your engine clean and injectors performance in shape. This could be a lot of undelivered promises
1,Had to grind it to work. How hard would it be to cast it the right size?????
1,7 inches to short,had to send it back for 80% money back
1,Never got it to work with my Pioneer FHX 720BT on my 2007 Hyundai Entourage. The support is terrible, the company emailed me once and never replied again. The instructions are confusing as well.
1,The fit is terrible.  Especially the cargo mat, there is a good 1 to 2 inches all the way around.  the squares that i'm assuming you are supposed to cut out to reveal the tie downs don't even come close to lining up with the actual tie down mounts.  The cargo mat is also a much lighter weight material than the floor liners... which I may add are barely liners, much more just like mats with lipped edges.  Fit is poor all around.  The rear seat liners are the only decent fit.  But even still not great.  I've had husky liners for my other car and they are much better.  I will be returning.  Too bad, I had high hopes for these.
1,bought the Stanley branded version of this to charge 2 12v mobility scooter batteries. i connected the first battery and pressed the charge button and it started charging at 14-15 amps and after 6-7 hours dropped to less than 2 amps and showed 100%. i connected the second battery and pressed the charge button and when i checked it 7 hours later the amps were still at 15 and the battery was so hot i though it would explode. the entire top of the battery it rippled from heat and two of the sealed plugs on top are leaking. needless to say the battery is ruined !		UPDATE : the manufacturer (Baccus Global) stepped up and paid for the ruined battery :-)
1,Very poor quality broke while installing. I was torquing to manufacturers specs. and cracked while doing so. Do not buy this cheap housing!!!
1,These mirrors are built horribly, the only thing they would be good for would be temporary fix on a car you don't really car about looks.  I was going to use this just to be legal but they aren't worth the time.
1,did not fit 2004 F150 FX4 supercab
1,The pictures are misleading. It did not come in a nice organized case as is pictured. Each fuse type came in a cheap plastic baggy with sharpie written on the outside of them for the fuse type. Disappointed. Seller should fix the pictures and not be so misleading.
1,had to return, one didn't work.
1,The details said that they would ship this tow hitch cover along with valve stem covers. The hitch cover came but without the valve stem covers. I was disappointed that they did not deliver what they advertised.
1,Took twenty days to arrive, and then it didn't work. I live in a major city so it's not like it went to the middle of no where. Tried to contact the seller multiple times with no response. In the end the product never worked and I still cannot get a response from the seller.
1,These liners are cheaper and stiffer them WeatherTech liners. I would prefer that they lay flat so my dog does not chew on the edges.
1,I bought this after the manufacture said it would fit my m/cycle....it doesn't.  I am a fan of K & N products and will try to find one that fits my bike. I'll save this one for a smaller application.  Not worth it to send it back.
1,Doesn't foam at all, it's more like white water. Didn't remove any brake dust from my wheels, very disappointed.
1,Did not add any color to my couch
1,Went bald in 60 days and were horribly lopsided. Cart bounced around pretty bad. Pre-assembled but not balanced.
1,Garbage. Filter sprayed fuel all over the truck. O ring was not correct fit for fuel bowl. When I took it out to investigate, it fell apart. Luckily I didn't throw my old one away and had to reinstall it. Do not buy.
1,These curtains are GARBAGE with a capitol G!!	Bought them for my Subaru Outback to gain some privacy if sleeping in the back when camping.	Great concept but very poor execution. Completely see through (adds maybe 10% more privacy than naked glass) and also the suction cups are not even attached to the curtains and I had to struggle to get them into their holder holes.	To top it off the packaging is completely in Chinese. COMPLETELY. I got suckered into buying these. My bad.	Do yourself a favour and look elsewhere or make your own. That's what I am going to try to do. They are getting shipped back to Amazon for a refund.
1,Did absolutely nothing
1,This was a wasteful addition suggested by Amazon, the bitwriter was already at the most current firmware. So this was wasted monies, and I have no way or reason to even see if the chip works
1,I would give this a zero if I could. Soooooo cheap. Wouldn't even turn over 27 hp engine. As soon as I seen it I knew I was in trouble. So cheap compared to Kohler. The bendix was stuck out right out of the box. I think this starter is getting shipped to multiple people and returned. Junk!
1,I have one light out of 3 that has filled up with water and I need to know how to exchange it
1,If your pitman is on tight enough, look elsewhere. This puller's threads are very fine and shallow, making it prone to seizing up during an extraction (they end up wearing down due to the friction and pressure). Mine was rendered unusable, so I'll look elsewhere.
1,Like many off road enthusiasts I really want a 50'' Led bar unfortunately I can't see myself handing over $1000.00 + to some companies, after searching around I give this Led bar a try. Delivery was fast and packaged was very secure in its box.	I ordered brackets that mount to the A pillars of my 07-JK the holes where the bolts would tighten up weren't threaded properly, I did manage to use a tap and create new threads and use larger bolts, needless to say after just one polite email regarding the threads the company was more than happy to mail me new side brackets and four of them for that matter, which has me believe they stand behind their product and back you up if something is off. So hats off the them for responding quickly and taking immediate action most company INCLUDING major name brands give you a little run around before anything but not them.		ABOUT THE LIGHT BAR; after I mounted it I waited for night fall to see how well the light bar works, with the flick of a switch and BAM! Night turned to day let me tell you I'm not impressed easily but holy s*** this thing is bright side to side and far out great spot flood combo I couldn't be happier DEFINETLY money WELL spent!! If you want/need a big light bar that really lets you see in the dark this is it and if the small chance something goes wrong they will take care of you, what more could an off road guy ask for? !!!!! Great Job!!		Update- I took off one star as of this morning I noticed condensation behind the glass, I know many vehicle headlights get this as well and work just fine I can only hope this light doesn't let me down when I need it most! Side note MHO I'm beginning to see why people pay for expensive lights. I may have had bad luck with this one as others are having no trouble at all. Will update if/when fails! Be safe!!!]		Update-04/24/14: To whom it may concern, tonight three led bulbs went out, I have had a problem with this light from the start. I had high hopes but I will not say its not bright or that it does not work! But the craftsman ship is cheap just like the price and no warranty. Three faults 1. bolt holes were not taped good. 2. Condensation problem,3. Three led bulbs out I'm sure the rest will surely follow.		I'm not a big review guy but if want/wanted an led bar as bad as me and don't want to save for name brand..? I strongly urge you to reconsider, Not a bad light as some had great experience I think its hit or miss..	Take it easy and remember the fun starts where the pavement ends!!!		2/24/15	Just an upadate incase anyone cared; the led bar is still working 2 lights are out, probly due to the moister. The price drop from what I paid is more than 50% If your handy open and reseal them as the others have stated, I will remove mine atempt to dry it out and reseal maybe even replace the dead led bulbs if its even doable, sorry if I missed any questions as I stoped getting the email response to them. If you have any feel free...
1,OK, it's not that I don't like it but this wiper does not fit 2013 mini countryman which needs a blade type connector NOT J type.  Said it was compatible with my car when I shopped for it.
1,Not what I expected, they kept falling with the suction cups provided.  Tried many times but still kept falling.
1,The package includes a harness to connect to the battery, and a cigarette lighter adapter to connect you accessories.  Comparing the harness with the ones provided with other products (i.e., Deltran battery tender) the Eklipes is of a much inferior quality and it looks cheaper, too.  Eyelet connectors are not very good, and the fuse holder does not have a secure cap (it tends to fall). In addition, the workmanship on the connectors could be improved. In regards to the adapter, it comes with a cap bigger than the adapter, so I ended up cutting it out and not using it. The cigarette adapter is usable but not the best out there, and the harness could be used for an application where there is no much vibration (I won't use it in a motorcycle), and where does not need to have a good seal for the fuse (I won't use it in a boat). For a few extra bucks you could get something of a much better quality.
1,I am done with Phillips lights. The filament seems to break much faster than other brands I have used. Maybe it is bad luck, maybe it is what I get for buying the cheapest thing out there, maybe you just get what you pay for.
1,Purchased this locally for my wife's car. It did not remove a single piece of sap. Perhaps it works on newly formed sap. But anything a week old, it won't make it budge at all. If you have hardened month-old or older sap, look elsewhere. (The small $1.29 bottle of hand santizer removed more sap (not all of it, but more than this spray!)
1,Good product. Ther gouging the price to where you can get sale of the week spray wax and come out way better in 23oz. Not on amazon though.
1,These are junk. I very really give a one star review but these deserve it. They are all cheap plastic every part of these connectors is cheap flimsy junk. I hate to trash a product but I could find no redeeming qualities at all with these connectors.  I am glad I bought just one order before I purchased the 1, 3, and four connector versions. I will be going with a different brand.
1,Finally got the spring off and found that the spacers do not slide over into place. Being highly irritated I took a torch to the plastic and made it fit. Not done yet, but will update, if all turns out I might change my rating.		UPDATE.	I got the front in and it looks great, then i find that the rear will not work. There is nowhere for the spring to rest, wasted 3 days and $200.		UPDATE pt2.	Could not get the rear to work, I had to buy lifted springs, $170.
1,This is beyond loud, I have a 94 Montero with a 3.0 v6. It sounds like I have a open exhaust. A mellow tone with true performance sound? not even close its as bad as those loud stupid Hondas with the fart mufflers on them.
1,More difficult to use than the ones with a wing nut. You need two wrenches at once to adjust. I used a second nut to keep the bolt from spinning then placed a wing nut to make things easier.
1,These don't work on my Honda, I screwed up and ordered for all the cars in my family and they don't fit. I've change hundreds of wiper blades over the years and never had one that just didn't fit the j hook. Do not take it upon yourself to modify the blade or your car, go buy another brand that slides right on lie it's supposed to do. I want my mo ey back but so far they are giving me a hard time, AGAIN DO NOT BUY IF NOT DIRECTLY SUPPLIED BY AMAZON BECAUSE THEY WILL FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO KEEP YOUR MONEY ON THEIR JUNK
1,didn't fit vehicle Corolla '03
1,I Purchased this less than 6 months ago and I no longer works.  I would have bought the more expensive one and it most likely would still be working.
1,Don't fit my jacks.
1,The bearing was loose after insulation. I torqued the nut to factory specks and it still has free play. It was way cheaper then buying it from the parts store but ended up paying full price to replace this one.
1,Had it for 9-months now and had enough.  Hard to get it centered correctly.  Leaks too much air so im junking it and buying another.
1,It's not a flasher... it's blinker and it only blinks for 4 days til the batteries start to wear down. Don't waste your $$$
1,After 1.5 months of use, 4 of the 10 are either blinking on and off or completely dead. These 4 were placed in the parking lights and license plate light of my car. Therefore they were on all the time at nights. The other 6 were placed inside the car so they don't get used as much. Therefore I am expecting the 6 in the interior to die in the next couple months or so.		Would NOT RECOMMEND. Unless you want to change out your bulbs every month.
1,This arrived in a tiny little plastic bag that basically looked like it had a cup full of dirt dumped in it before the shipper closed it for shipping. The net itself seems to be of extremely low quality. Not sure I'll ever actually use it.		It also smelled so bad that I immediately put it outside before even looking at it. It's still out there as I type this.
1,didn't work on my 2005 dodge ram
1,Initially I thought these looked great but upon further review I decided against them. Basically I want everyone to be aware of the differences in quality and manufacture compared to the originals. I did take one of these apart because I was curious. It was a small investment in the name of science. As it turns out these Dorman switches have LED's in them which may be considered a bonus. However the light they emit is quite different than all the other factory gauges. It is much whiter however strangely enough they are not as bright. Also the lettering on three of the switches I got was applied sloppily. All in all I was let down. I am returning all four and getting the GM ones.
1,I thought this would be a quality item.  Its a shame it has the ARB name/logo on it.  I can't imagine that they would put their name on an item with such poor quality, I wonder if they know?  is it truly an ARB product?		The issue is that it feels cheap, the gauge does not work, and it leaks air out all over the place.  It looks pretty, and seems like it should work, but looks can be deceiving.
1,Ok, nice features with the light, jumper cables, and the display to show battery state and rate of power drain.  But mainly the amps are good.  It performs as rated and holds up well.  The only drawback is, it leaves me wondering how they do free shipping on something this heavy?		Edit - Years later it died on me, with no AC output.  The fuse was ok.  I bought another one and it also died in the same fashion just after it was outside of the warranty.  So, my 5 stars changes to 1 star.
1,had to have a metal shop re drill the hole to fit the threaded trailer ball. Only 1 bolt holding it onto the tractor so it tends to move left to right , should have been made with 2 holes instead. gonna have some welding done to it to make it safe. Definitely Not Safe as is. !!

One worked long enough allow me to clean my trunk. The other two didn't work at all.		----		This review is for the sprayer itself, as I can not test the product. The sprayer is defective; plain and simple. It needs a stronger spring inside to push the plunger back out. I was able to clear the air out of the nozzle, when I first opened it, but it stopped working as soon as the product entered the sprayer head.		Not only that, but the base of the sprayer has some sort of lock ring on it. So even if you have another bottle or sprayer, you can get the product out of this bottle without sawing the top off.		What gives, Chemical Guys?		I ordered another today... that I can HOPEFULLY use. If so, my review will be updated.
1,Horrible boots for the price. Buckles are EXTREMELY difficult to buckle and the buckles also pull apart. These boots didn't even survive a weekend of riding.	WOULD HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND. Buy some Fly Racing Maverick boots with much better quality for the same price.
1,Save your money. This product doesn't allow for you to use all 4 screws on your plate to secure it properly. Barely covers the bumper to my 2014 Honda Accord. DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR BUMPER! I don't even use it anymore!
1,Not blue as stated. color is black
1,Cleans upholstery but there is not moisture or sheen to it after it dries.
1,F-
1,Does not fit the inner surface of the bumper as other 1 star reviews have noted. Instructions were very simple, and for a hitch that fit the truck would have been adequate.		Shipped with Curt bolts and parts with instructions in a bag inside the hitch, in the Amazon box was about 20 5/8" bolts, random, and loose in the box with the shipping material.		Did not have to drill.	Did not have to remove any shims or crossmembers.		Used some washers to space the bumper out from the hitch mount bolts. Makes bumper stick forward about 1/2", looks a little weird, but was easiest way to make it work.		Installed on a 2000 Ford F250, 4x4.
1,EDIT:		I was shorted on the roll about 3 or 4 times in a row.		The product itself is great, but the rolls are all cut at sizes that are random to within 1/4 of an inch. I finally had to report them for having an inaccurate description considering the first roll was clearly not a mistake.		As I said, the vinyl is great, but when you're working with a Silhouette Cameo 2  you need either 9" or 12" rolls. Anything in between is troublesome because of the design of the rollers. I probably wasted a whole roll of material because of bad cuts from the rollers slipping because the rollers can only be placed at intervals supporting 9 or 12 inches. If you have the rollers set for 9" and the roll is 11.4 or 11.5 then the roll will slip, turn, and your cuts will just be horribly ruined.		Solid vinyl, but someone is terrible at marketing.		Great product but i have been repeatedly shorted on the roll width. This roll is not 12 inches. It is about 11.4 to 11.6 inches. 3 orders in a row i have had the same experience each time. I will bot order again if it happens again. 3 times might be a mistake but if it happens again it is intentional.		I have a machine which requires either a 9 inch or 12 inch roll. The rollers on the machine are set to the wodth of the roll but only have options for 9 or 12... nothing in between. I tried to make it work, but it causes a lot of discards... and i don't really like being shorted on product repeatedly.		3 stars. 1 star if it happens again.
1,nothing more to say
1,Do yourself a favor, save up a little extra $ and buy Motul 7100 4T!!!!  You won't regret it!!!!  Your bike will HONESTLY run and shift much better than using this crap!!!!  Castrol is NOT ester based, Motul is!!!!  Motul is TOP SHELF, Castrol is BOTTOM of the barrel!!!!!!!  Motul uses only class V base stocks, Castrol uses much cheaper and much lower quality class II and III base stocks if even that!!!!  Mobil 1 isn't much better either!!!  Do yourself a favor and read the reviews for Motul 7100 4T before buying this stuff!!!!
1,The good:  Once broken in, it looks and feels good.  Provides much protection, with decent quality leather, pads and zippers.  The bad:  Arrives hard as a rock, and needs leather conditioning and removal of pads to break in, by scrunching it with your hands for hours.  There are only two pockets, and they are thin and cheap.  They will rip and you'll lose your keys or cell phone in no time.  The liner is thin and cheap.  And, worst of all, the sleeves are about 3 inches longer than they should be.  So, unless you're a gorilla, you won't fit it.
1,Getting my Kuryakyn pegs and stirrups to work was a nightmare. Even after multiple calls to tech support, I kept buying the wrong parts. All of the adapters are confusing, and non-compatible.		I suppose the worst part is that even once I managed to get all of the right stuff, it turns out it's so poorly designed that my pegs slip no matter how hard I torque them down. We even tried welding them, but I stood up over a hard bump, and broke the weld. I think this one needs to go back to the engineers.		The Harley adapters are splined. The splined adapters work ONLY on Harleys.	The non-splined adapters will NEVER TIGHTEN. DANGEROUS!
1,This is way too small to be useful.
1,Returned it . Too confusing. strong smell too. wanted something easy to throw over a load.
1,Too small for being XL size elbow guard..
1,These do not work on the 10th anniversary edition/Rubicon X/Hard Rock Bumpers. Also, the welds connecting the bars to the frame are terribly thin and look like garbage.
1,did not stop or slow down any leak in my truck.
1,Garbage. It won't stay plugged in on my 2014 mazda 6. My car uses the same type of fuses, but this thing is to bulky to stay in it's place. It tends to fall out.
1,did not fit
1,Cheaply made.  The clip-on chuck broke after only a few uses.  Definitely NOT heavy duty.  To make matters worse, the chuck isn't standard 1/4" NPT thread found on most other units.  Hence, it can't be replaced with the most widely available chucks.		Debating whether to return the unit for a refund.
1,Broke the first time I used it
1,Tight but adequate fit on my 2011 BMW 3 series.		First: If this is 3 layers, I had better go get a magnifying glass. There is no soft inner lining on this cover, the inner side looks just like the outer side.		Secondly, while there are grommets in the middle on both sides, there are no protective flaps to protect the car from the hooks of a bungee cord that would attach there (not supplied).		Third, it comes vacuum packed in a small cube, meaning it is totally wrinkled when you get it. Not sure how long it will take for the wrinkles to fall out.		 5 year warranty was promised. That will be interesting....
1,Did not fit
1,Becareful.  Broke.  Machined too thinly.  Dangerous for any use.
1,DID NOT FIT MY 2005 FORD EXCURSION 6.0 DIESEL
1,Horrible! I mean for tiny messes that do need any suction to clean up. I would suggest buying something better and saving the headache and money.
1,No work
1,Its cheap but works. Not for an every day garage type use. More of a "every once a while, weekend warrior
1,Should have bought a better one
1,The glue on the 3M doesn't hold them down well.
1,I have a 16 Fatboy S and this will not thread into the factory hole.
1,the damn wrench that is needed to perform the job is missing and is not in the kit.	this just sucks.
1,This Cover did not last as long as I thought a $300 cover should. Lasted a little over 1 year, in a area that never freezes, gets little rain (drought conditions in 2014), was not removed and put on that much (less than 10 Times).  The Tyvek seemed to hold up, although I can now push my finger through it easily, but the sides are turning to dust.  It can not hold up to the sun, and I am not kidding it is literally turning to dust, big rips from the little wind it saw, and just falling apart.  I will try a different manufacturer next (already ordered) and hope for the best.
1,Sticker peeled off within a day.
1,Cheap
1,Read product description carefully!! These are cheap plastic  and not worth the $$$
1,This unit is seldom used,but doesn't seem to work,even after overnite charging
1,Didn't work on 97 Wrangler.
1,They don't fit good at all, you need to file down the plastic on the bottom of the bulb.  Then on top of that, the 2 i ordered didn't work....
1,wrong item from my truck
1,worst Headlight Bulb I ever used. it burns after three days. Do NOT buy this product, you will west your money.
1,Nice on picture, but in person disappointed, nothing fit the way i wanted
1,I ran the year, Make and model and the system verified it was the correct part. When I received it, and removed the old one, it was not the correct part. Had to send it back, but at least Amazon payed for the shipping.		Little things are bound to happen when you buy online, I still love ya Amazon..
1,Purchased this item and it fit perfectly but malfunctioned about 2 months later. Had to buy a new one from my local autopart store for anout the same price!
1,This door doesn't fit a 2016 Ford F150, it is too big, I measured it at 8.5 inches, the fuel door hole on my truck is 7.5 inches.
1,Lasted only 7 months and 1 burnt out., other started pulsing and flickering.	Started becoming dim in 3 months
1,stright up junk
1,I used it twice and it stopped working.
1,Not very bright. Still working after 13 months.
1,I bought this tailgate lock and it does prevent the tailgate from opening.  But standby if someone mistakenly pulls your tailgate handle while the lock is locked.  It will break the plastic linkage clips.  It happened twice on my Chevy.  The lock prevents the passenger side linkage from moving.  If someone pulls on the handle thinking the lock is unlocked, that linkage is forced against the lock arm and will break.  I had to remove the lock, the tailgate bezel and replace the the linkage connectors.  Not worth the hassle.
1,Cheap
1,Stuck shut after about 500 miles or so and started overheating. Had new, good quality coolant in the system and still...
1,These knobs do NOT fit properly. I purchased for my 2001 TJ, they go on, but they do not press on deep enough to allow the knob to be flush to the air control panel. They stick out aprox 1/4" allowing the back light to beam out while driving at night. VERY UN-HAPPY
1,Looks like a good unit but after only 2 wks backed into unit lightly and corner of assembly where u rod goes threw ball assembly broke off.not very theft proff.
1,no
1,These came in but what they don't tell you is that you might have to buy a taillight relocation kit also to use these. But we alter them just a little and it worked. Just luckily we were creative. So read the Fine print.
1,I tried to use it for the first time but to no avail. Every time I tried I got this number 1888.88. When I click the button it says no psi found and them battery is dead. It is a waste of money don't buy it.
1,First, to be clear, I bought these for my 2012 CTS-V, and as others have mentioned, this product is NOT a plug and play for this year and model car. However, using the ol' dremel technique, I was able to open the mounting holes a bit to get these lights in there. I also followed up by adding a screw to each mount by drilling a hole through the door cover and into the light's housing near the end with the plug; with this screw in place the lights are more secure and not as likely to wiggle out of my newly dremeled holes.		The projection on the floor under the driver's door is perfect - bright and sharp. However, the projection under the passenger's door is not as sharp; it's just a wee bit fuzzy. It is for this reason I gave this product 4 stars and not 5. True, I may have knocked something out of whack during the installation, but I'm pretty sure I didn't. To potential buyers: the fuzziness is very very slight, and you may not even notice it. I probably only noticed it because the driver's side is so sharp!		Update: March 9, 2017	OK, it's been several months now with these lights. Unfortunately, they've become fuzzy and washed out (see the pic). I'm downgrading my original rating since they do not last as long as promised in the listing. Will buy another brand next time.
1,Had some play in it right out of the box.
1,Product did not fit my 2018 F150 SuperCrew very well at all.  The center console is larger than the cutout, so the mat either had to be tucked between the carpet and the console (which it is not designed to do), or it curved up the sides, either way causing spaces and wrinkes underneath where it would not lay flat.  It was also too wide front to back, and either curled up the side of the under seat storage box, or had to be tucked under, which deformed the molded-in contours of the liner.  No amount of warm temperatures or settling in the truck is going no to improve the fit because it is so far off, and you shouldnt have to cut or trim an $85 liner.  Very plasticy and cheap in feel and appearance.  Returned 20 minutes after opening the box.  Hopefully the X-Act Contour rubberized Husky liners are a better fit, more rubber-like material and higher quality.  That is what I'm going to try next.  If not, I'll go with something else.		I also ordered the Weatherbeater front Husky mats.  While they fit well, just like with the rear liner I am not impressed with the plastic feel, and I also returned those in exchange for the X-Act Contours.
1,95 Impala SS with a hypertech 160f was replaced with this Stant thermostat in hope that the mileage would improve during winter driving. It increased the temp but after 10 days the car began to over heat and the mileage dropped. I put the hypertech back in and the car runs great (as usual) and mileage is back to 20mpg.
1,They look ok from a distance but, not quite what I was looking for. I returned them with no problem.
1,Broke
1,Maybe I was expecting to much, bright long reaching white light. What I got was maybe 10% more light, slightly more to the sides and slightly more far out, with brightness and color about the same as my stock lights. Which would be fine except I paid about 3 times as much for these as stock bulbs would have cost. When these burn out I will be trying something else!
1,no
1,It works, but the mechanism is poor for the price.  This simply blocks the gate latch, rather than disconnecting it like a regular door lock.  Seems like only a matter of time before someone breaks the plastic handle off the gate.  The metal on metal is not well finished and makes for a very loud device.  I filed it down and put some marine grease on it, but its still pretty clunky.  The new version comes with a foam block that needs to be cut to size, preventing the device from rattling around inside the gate.  I also added a metal bracket reaching from unfastened end of the lock to the other end of the handle mount as recommended on the forums to reinforce the security.
1,I returned this upon arrival. Too cheaply built to put on a Harley - King of the Road.
1,Failed after 5 days
1,I returned these. not what I wanted. I would have been great if the plug in would fit the Standard 12 V socket, but they don't, they are smaller.
1,4500 miles already lights back on and rattles
1,Afer a month filter melted and would not flow/  I did research and find out it was probably because of MTBE in fuel her in CT
1,This product is not suited for any applications including boost pressure  it worked for a few weeks but the internal design  a small plastic cage a spring and a flap of round rubber failed and sucked the rubber flap out of the unit. I would imagine it would work fine under normal vaccume naturally.
1,The idea is good but don't waste your money on the dual drive. In the spaces that you need to access (at least on my Tundra) you will never be able to use the 1/2 drive. Also, had to spend some time filing a "burr" that would not let me insert the 3/8 drive.
1,This one is a waste of money!	Doesn't even work if you use a heat gun!	Looks cheap!
1,I'm sorry for a bad review but would really hate for someone else getting a bad valve cover due to the pcv galleries not being anywhere near the size they should be. Could've been just a bad batch but with that happening but it wasn't running right and blowing oil out the exhuast within minutes of being installed from not being able to breathe properly.
1,Had as hell  does not help neck  and cost to return
1,I am large guy and I normally wear 4xl shirts.i ordered the 5xl just to be safe. It was a real 5xl which was surprising. The materials all seemed top notch but for one problem. The teeth of the outer shell zipper would actually move. This would prevent me from zipping it up. That was the only problem but unfortunately a big problem. Amazing was awesome.and let me return the jacket. I bought another brand that doesn't fit as well but the zippers arentop notch. I may buy this again if the offer hi viz in the larger sizes for fall riding.
1,NUTURAL
1,I've used this filter with great success on my Yamaha R1 for several years, but somewhere along the line it's changed.  As it now leaks oil around the gasket.  I've tried to tighten, changed filters thinking it was just one with a defect and still the leak.  Disappointing because I've really had good luck with this filter in the past.
1,Started wearing this on Sept. 18 on our first ride but it lacks padding in the front causing lots of wind noise in intercom and is very uncomfortable on the top due to lack of padding. Maybe a great backup helmet if you only plan to wear for a short time. Not a great riding experience.
1,One light went out last night 3/5/2014. I bought them June 7 2011, but didn't install them till probably Nov. 2011. So by my count that is Nov 2011-12-13 to 3/5/2014. So 2 years and a few months. Factor in not driving ALL the time, and wow...didn't last long. They are awesome lights and excellent brightness and color...but seemingly short lived.
1,Took some time to install. Stopped working after 8 months.	Went to U-Haul and installed their store brand wiring kit, paid extra for insurance and will be replaced if it ever fails.
1,It was delivered ok and it was easily assembled.  HOWEVER, it does not fit my Hyundai Santa Fe.  The factory roof rack cross bars are too far apart at their closest settings.  Make sure your racks are no more than 30 inches apart on center.  Now if I want to keep it I have to buy the extension piece for another $60.00 and wait for another week.  This is very frustrating.  They said it would fit.
1,Bought 6 months ago and did not realize the threads on the tool were incorrect pitch. They were course thread. Even the nut that came with it was the right pitch, but not the tool. Should have checked back when I bought it so I could exchange it. Now it's too late. 1 star cause when I really needed it, it failed me.
1,One of the bulbs burned out really fast, and have had intermittent phases of it not igniting right out of the box.
1,Only had these about 6 weeks before one of them tore when I was folding it. The other one has lasted longer but I never remove it so it hasn't had the opportunity to tear yet.
1,I own a car wash in Florida and I have 16 employees that each use one to dry vehicles by hand, I bought these to try them out compared to the Absorber brand and boy am I dissatisfied. In just over 2 weeks the chamois has completely destroyed itself and is starting to peel. The absorber brand usually lasts me 3-4 years. These are terrible and need to be removed from Amazon.
1,terrible, cables not soldered correctly..
1,***UPDATE***	Initially I posted a good review for this product (5 stars) but I recently had to remove the wheels from my vehicle and ALL of these lug nuts started to strip out! I used the correct size wrench and was just amazed at how soft and cheesy these lugs really are. Prior to this update these lugs were installed once and removed once. The OEM lugs had less wear on them and I know those had been installed and removed at least 50 times. The locking lugs seem to be much more durable and I decided to continue using them. It is because of the locking lugs that this product is getting 2 stars instead of 1.		***ORIGINAL REVIEW***	About a year ago, the tires and rims were stolen off my Dodge Caravan. I ended up getting 4 tires and rims from a junk yard for $100 and finally decided to purchase new tires and factory aluminum rims.		Obviously I don't want some punk a-- delinquent teen steeling them again, so I ended up getting this lug nut & lock kit from Gorilla.		I've used other locking lugs before but they weren't this nice...plus I like the fact that these will be nearly impossible to strip out.		This kit comes with 4 locking lug nuts & key, 20 standard open acorn style lug nuts with 13/16 socket and 4 rubber valve stems - only the one I received did NOT include the valve stems. No biggie because I also purchased 4 of the Gorilla inner mount chrome valve stems (part no VS402C).
1,A little weak in the center/ poor quality weld job
1,Typical, the manufacturer praises it to the sky but it's really just cheap fabric.  We'll see how it holds up but I don't expect much.
1,There are better products out there.  Rustoleum metal finish is probably the closest match I can get to a metal look.  I refinish car rims and found this product useless.
1,could not get it to work
1,rusted within a few days
1,SINCE IT DOES NOT COME WITH ANY WAY TO INSERT INTO THE TIRES,  I TRIED TO MAKE  MY OWN AND IT JUST MADE A BIG MESS, SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS OR NOT. VERY UNHAPPY.
1,This is my second thermostat and the first one had no gasket so I just chalked it up as an oversight. But when I replaced another thermostat that one had no gasket either, so it's more than an oversight. Don't tell me a gasket comes with it when it does not. I will buy no more from this company. Also if you have a supercharger this will not fit any 3800. Nowhere is that stated that I saw
1,These quick disconnect couplers would not fit on my '85 Ford F150. On one of the couplers (blue one), I was unable to get the coupling to move. I saw several reviews that stated you would need to use pliers sometimes but I chose to return the parts undamaged.
1,It looks good, but only for a few months. The problem is that when it does start fading and wearing off, it looks terrible.  White splotches, and uneven wearing.  The fix for that is applying more but it does not hide the nasty white splotches, so you end up encasing the ugly plastic under more product.		The other issue is that it is difficult to remove.  So it's not feasible to remove it and start over. So you end up covering an expensive product with more expensive product that literally locks in the ugly faded product.  Some reviews say this is from applying too much of this, but that was not the case.  I did not use too much product, since that can also lead to really bad results.		Also, the product does get scratched or smeared if you're not careful.  This can happen after the product is dried and "cured".  So you can have smears or blemishes that can't be buffed out or covered.		I really wish I had never touched the black plastic trim on my vehicle.  Other people have plastic much older than mine and it looks brand new.  I spent 50 bucks to make mine look like crap.  Don't use this product.
1,Could not get it to fit my 2015 GMC. I end up sending it back and reorder the stubby for the 2014 model and it fitted perfectly.
1,Not really a Reese and did not fit.  the ad was not clear and I got the wrong item.  When I modified per instructions it was too late to return it!  I ordered the correct hitch from another company.
1,Had metal shavings still stuck inside, Not worth sucking them into my engine. Not 50 states legal, Decided I didn't want to have to remove and re install every time I needed to smog truck. Returned and purchased USA made PPE boost increase valve instead.
1,I purchased this from another outfit.	Pros, the hose itself seems tough enough.	Cons: if you are using more than one hose and only one is the Blue Line, then it has to be the one that connects to the CG sewer inlet. That is where the problem lies. I ran into the same problem more than once, the elbow will not screw in, either too big or too small, and it is too short to stay in a rubber donut/sewer ring. Of course if you have two blue line hoses, the problem is still the same. I ended u[ reusing some old Valterra bayonet screw-in fittings and adapting this hose to fit a standard elbow. I am hanging on to the Blue Line elbow, not sure why though. I use this hose as my spare. I am now depending on a Rhino Flex hose.
1,I give this a 2 star only because it didn't look good on my jeep.  I wanted it to go on the side of where the unlimited sticker went but after placing it, I decided it didn't look good because it was too thick and looked like a sticker instead of blending in with the color of my jeep which is bright white.
1,The 320 cannot be installed in my RV as the existing toilet has a 9.5" flange setback from the back wall and the 320 requires an 11" setback. It is frustrating to read all of the positive reviews and questions/answers and not find any indication on the Amazon web site that there could be a setback issue. Has the setback been noted I would not have wasted my time and have to pay return shipping. Next time I will try to locate an owner's manual before I purchase.
1,Does not fit de3175, too big! Broke a couple trying to make it fit so I can't evendors return them
1,The picture posted shows a short connector, and it needs to be updated with the correct 1 1/2 inch length. See pictures from other offerings.		The valve is otherwise very good quality and would work fine for all applications that had enough room to install it.	In my particular application on a 300Z Twin Turbo if I put the value on there is not room to plug the adapter into it, needs to be 1/2 shorter. Now I have 2 extra ones and still have to use alternative R12 original connector going to my gauge so people would not know it has been converted to R134 if the conversion sticker fell off.
1,I will need to drill several additional holes to match up with the factory body alignment. The part is good quality except for the mounting holes not aligning.
1,I installed this 13" antenna after reading the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I lost most AM and FM reception with this antenna, so I took it off and reinstalled the OE antenna. I suppose "AntennaX" refers to the lost radio stations you will get after installing it. I do not recommend buying this product.
1,Look good fit well. But need a resistor. Blinkers blink very fast now. Annoying.
1,Would not remove from transfer paper
1,Very bright AUX lights, but they do NOT throw a large or usable beam pattern down the road. I would look somewhere else for floods.
1,Says fits my car in description. This is wrong. By the time it was time to do my oil change it was too late to send back. I emailed seller and asked if they would make exception because of the mislead and no one replied.
1,These keep popping out and I'll need to glue them in.
1,You go through all of the trouble of removing the fixture then wiring up the replacement and then the switch is turned on and no light.  I had a fixture from another supplier hooked it up and it words fine.  I'd pass on Luitronics products.
1,The cover is not UV tolerant. The cover fades and deteriorates quickely.
1,Very very thick gel like and hard to spread around the tires. I've tried a brush, foam pad, and a towel. Noting works for me
1,Came with a long deep scratch in one corner and the larger bolts that connect to the tow package through the bumper bracket don't fit back in. Instead they give you small cheap ones that the head is too small and goes through the tow package hole
1,Did not work upon arrival. The truck was idling at around 1700 rpm and surging with no throttle response. Tge one I was replacing worked better. Ended up paying 200 dollars for an OEM and the truck runs smooth again.
1,Smudgy
1,Alternator came in a box that was not well padded so it broke through just a bit, but not really a big deal.	Everything looked ok upfront so I went ahead and installed it, went to connect the computer connector (plug that you see in the picture 3) just to find that half of the rim around the connector is not there and also the little tab that hold the plug in place is gone.	I had to use zip ties to hold the connector in place.	Sure I could have returned the unit and hopped for the best next time but not having a car another week or two while this is getting sorted out is not an option, at least not a good option.	I'm sure this was an oversight at the checkup but I did hope that ACDelco would have higher QC compare to a cheap brand that I could have gotten.	So there... the unit works, plug does not, bummer......
1,Looks like a ring filer but its really not!! Returned
1,They don't fit good for a normal person	Also, they are so long someone if they hit your side of the head, there goes your ear drums..	And you can't wear a helmet with them.
1,Didn't fit
1,bulb is not bright, only can see 2" distance or less.
1,The hardware (screws) that come with this are soft junk.  Pre-drilled every hole and still two of them snapped.  I don't trust the ladder, my 9 year old daughter (who is generally fearless) doesn't trust or like the ladder.  It's what you pay for though, I didn't expect a lot for $39, and didn't get a lot.
1,Top cover comes off every time it is used
1,Failed in 9 months. Alignment and fit were fine, but rubber is already shot. I purchased the Amazon item believing it was high quality, but now see there is no warranty stated. By comparison, these mounts have a lifetime warranty when purchased at AutoZone, NAPA, etc.
1,Does not fit my 03' BMW e46. I'm going to have to drill and I'm afraid they're too long as well. The 'washers' are cool though.
1,Low quality, should report that it is a simple impression
1,Seems heavy duty enough with a lot of places for trimming. Does not fit my 2013 Mini Cooper Countryman. I feel like if a product is truly universal, call it universal. If a product "fits most vehicles," then don't call it universal.
1,I bought this thinking they were going to be blue but there were not blue there white with a little blue tint to it
1,1) Thin Cheap plastic.	2) cord is too short to reach power point.		It does light up when connected and held by my wife as i tested it
1,Definitely does not compare to a flow master has the rumble but not the clarity and tone of a flow master. Pay the extra money
1,Bought this kit with an Amazon PrimeNow order a few weeks ago. I tried using the #2 phillips head bits from the kit to install 10 sheets of sheet rock (drywall) on a new wall. The #2 bits from this kit wear down after 4 or 5 drywall screws and must be replaced. The material used to make the bit seems to be softer than the material the drywall screws are made of resulting in stopping work often to replace the worn bit.
1,This is to long for the 97 Chev 3500 Tail gates but it is listed to fit.
1,a family friend had a foam snow pusher like this last winter and it was great, so i decided to get one. since we got our first significant snowfall today in massachusetts, i thought it would be a perfect opportunity to try my new purchase out on my car. the item extends, but no matter how much i twist, or what direction i twist, it won't remain extended. the pole also constantly unscrews from the foam piece. i'm unsure if i just got a defective one, or if this is a cheap imitation of the one from shark tank.
1,The Mini-Fuse connector has blades that are too thin:  They will fall out of the fuse socket.  They also won't be able to make good electrical contact unless constant pressure is being applied to them.  I did not test the other two sizes, so cannot comment on them.	Also, the holes on all the connectors are too small for multimeter test leads.  They can only be used if the test leads are being held and pressed against the connectors.	To top it off, this poor quality comes at a steep price of $17 for a few pieces of plastic-coated metal.
1,Luckily, I checked it out before I needed it. The telescopic handle was difficult, if not impossible to loosen up and operate. Even after I used a rubber gripper to loosen it, it would not loosen again after it was tightened. Sadly the brush/pusher part of it was very gentle on car finishes and would have been nice to use. I just re-packaged it to send back.
1,The sound SUCKS.  A noise like a strangled cat.	My stock horns were louder and clearer.
1,bad
1,JUNK	I ordered these back in September of 2017.	When I received them immediately thought to my self, wow these appear to be extreme LOW quality.		The wire terminations to the connector ends were lose and easy to wiggle.		It does not take a highly skilled person to know that ANY electrical connection that isn't firm will eventually cause arcing.	Arcing is normally seen at the wire terminations.	Arcing wasn't visible until I removed the headlight bulb from the socket itself and looked down into th connector.		The plastic had melted and caused the bulb to malfunction.	Though it took since September to December 21st for me to discover this, Im extremly lucky to have found this because the plastic melted pretty good and it eventually would have caught fire and burned my truck!		There is no question that this product is junk!		I contacted the seller yesterday and they explained to me that  it was out of warranty  but they have one laying around they could give to me.. Id have to pay for shipping ..	well I decided to pass.. shipping was a week out and I couldn't drive with only one headlight out.		I went to a chain auto parts store and bought two new h13 sockets and repaired them so they now work safely		I would like my money back!!!	F ing Junk.  Do not buy!
1,The mat in this pic is not the mat I received.  The package shows correct mat but the mat is wrong.  Charged $25 to return a mat that was not my mistgake.
1,I really can't see how this gets so many 5 star reviews. I'm not trying to continually kick CG but this product fails bigly... first off there's really no such thing as a specific black or white car polish/sealant. Second this is mostly a glaze that doesn't last long at all. Do research and you'll find a boat load of better stuff on the market. Just because a company is good at marketing doesn't always mean they have the best solutions, just that they know how to advertise.
1,A short term solution.  Only worked for a week or two in my car.  Sea Foam will do the same thing for half the cost.
1,This is a difficult review to write.	The product seems well designed, and had it worked, I would have been elated with how easy it is, and that it's 1/3 the cost of buying a new fob and having a dealer program it (Quoted $150 from a local dealer).	That being said, I'm really bummed that despite amazon saying it's the right product for a 14' Elantra GT (w/o smart key), it failed to program.	The programmer unit that plugs into the ODB port has a limited life span of 3 program cycles.	I assume this is so you can't buy 1, and share it with all your buddies forever.	This means that after you use it to program (or in my case try to program) a fob 3 times, it's garbage.	It says this in very clear text on the instructions, so it's not a surprise or anything, but I think it's important people know that.	The steps to program are very straight forward:	**Do not put your car key in at any time during this process**	1. Plug programmer into ODB port, it has an LED light that illuminates and the device will chirp.	2. Press and hold the the lock button on the fob/remote (for an unspecified amount of time) and the cars door locks will cycle, and the headlights will flash.	The video Dorman (the manufacturer) has on youtube says the exact same info.		I followed the instructions carefully.	The programmer plugged into the ODB port, lit up, and chimed.	I held the lock button non-stop for the 2 minute programming window, and the programmer finally timed out, and shut off.	The locks did not cycle, the lights did not flash.		After 2 failed attempts, I called Dorman support to explain what I was up against and that I only had 1 try left.	Dorman Support said I had the right model for our car, and if it failed it was a sign of a faulty unit and we should seek a replacement from the seller.	(Side note - The seller was super easy to work with. This review is only for the product, not the seller in any way).		After getting a replacement package, I tried the process yet again, and again, failed 3 times.	It seems unlikely that we managed to get 2 faulty units back to back.	From discussing with the vendor directly, it sounds like the device is intended for 2014 Elantra GT's (couldn't find anything that explicitly listed the GT model as supported though), but Dorman support did say it's supposed to work on this car.	We're working towards a return, but I'm let down that I can't make this product work as a solution, and will have to work with a dealership for a new fob.		Again, seems like a well made product... and if it works on your car I suspect it would be perfect, but it didn't work for us.		Update 6-6-2017:	I went to a Hyundai dealership to get an oem FOB programmed for our 14' GT.	They said since I was paying for a FOB from them, and programming from them, they were willing to try programming in this Dorman remote, since they already were putting the car in programming mode.	Even with the GT in programming mode from the dealership, it would not accept this remote.	So it doesn't seem to be an issue only with the programming device that gets plugged in - it seems this unit doesn't work for the GT from start to finish.		I did find it does work on our 13' Elantra Sedan, which is great. But the review stands - bought this for the GT since Amazon & Dorman said it was compatible and it simply isn't.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!  Just recently had the chance to use this charger. I noticed it was light compared to the other Schumacher chargers I've purchased in the past and are still working great but anyway I put it into service and it started up as normal "Charging" and worked for a few days and quit!  Comparing this new one to my old ones that I purchased at Tractor Supply, it appears that thay've gone from an internal heavy duty charging ballast to a cheap little circuit board charger which is worthless. If you have one of these chargers in service be careful as I doubt it has any circuit protection to protect it from catching fire!  I will contact Amazon and attempt to return this piece of JUNK!
1,Dimensions of the muffler itself are a little bit smaller then the original pulled off the Jeep but perfect fit otherwise! I used a grinding wheel to help speed up the removal process of the old muffler. The new one slid right into place - no need to jack up the back either!		......had to amend to 1 star. Less than 2 years later the welds on the support brackets broke loose. Also the seams at both ends of the muffler started to give way. Fortunately my nephew is in a Jeep club and I managed to get an OEM take off muffler from someone installing and aftermarket exhaust system. It wasn't a big deal swapping out mufflers but I cold have done something better with my time if I had just bought a very reputable muffler in the first place. Anyway - good luck with it.
1,Quality of the wrap is terrible. Does NOT have air channels to let out air bubbles and should NOT be applied dry because of that. Awful product. Did not come with said "FREE Squeegee" either. Shipped with tons of wrinkles and folds as well.
1,Dozens of major streaks across the windshield.  Did a warranty exchange and the local shop cleaned my windows with a specia solution.  New wipers have the exact issue.  Massive streaks.  Streaks are so big there are a safety concern while driving in the rain.		I believe the curve is the problem.  Too much pressure is needed to press the wiper onto the word shield.		Ended up returning the second new set and bought some very cheap wipers.  Problem solved!
1,BRING YOUR SEEINE EYE DOG,YOULL NEED IT
1,It looks good but it didn't fit my 2010 wrangler
1,Bought these to replace high mount stop light 920 in my camaro. These were less than 1/4 the brightness of regular bulbs. Smaller Yorkim 194 LED bulbs with the same base were more than twice as bright. These are not suitable for stop lights. These are not even bright to look at in daylight.
1,Died last month.... inspected and the grease was still good. bearing race failure ... was told by doorman to return VIA amazon, but amazon shows the return window closes after 30 days on auto parts ! UGH !
1,these locks go to hell fast in the Minnesota winters, I have had 3 of them now and rubber cap comes off and then they get salt then the lock stops working. I am going to have to make some kind of cap that will stay there to keep the elements out..It is the only one I could find for my anderson hitch though :(
1,cheaply made not worth the packaging it came in
1,It is water proof. but, after having it outside over my car for 6 months, IT DISOLVED.  It pretty much disintegrated in the sun in California.  It turned to dust ( White Powder) almost everywhere it touched the car, (Grey color car)  Now, I have to get rid of the residue and have my car detailed.  The "Cover dust" is EVERYWHERE.  This thing is GARBAGE !!  good for indoors only !!  If something is advertised as a (rain barrier) folks might think it is usable Outdoors.... right?
1,Giving it 2 stars because it has lasted less than 1 year.  I guess the weld broke loose between the bracket and the tube, so now I'm having to replace it again.
1,Maybe me, but I could not make them seal on a motorcycle. Returned them.
1,this is too tiny you get the picture and it looks huge but when you get it its like not even an inch goes on the back of the window how is anybody supposed to read that you're an RN that Staten Island  New York lady rider
1,This product looks great on my f150.  However, I lost most of my radio stations because of poor reception. I had to put the old one back on....
1,Decent kit but definitely not for my M20. Fortunately the o ring did fit which was what I really needed but nothing else fits the carb. Cheap enough so I simply tossed the other parts
1,Not a very good product.  Was supposed to work with my truck but it wouldn't plug in to light up and it fell apart within a couple weeks.
1,UPDATE 9-1-17		A year later, the compressor is broken. As expected, the motor is cheap, weak and has fried after inflating 1 car tire from low (10 PSI) pressure. This happened out in a national forest, so it was not convenient, to say the least. Not a good unit for reliability, that's for sure.		--		I use this pump to inflate bicycle tires about once a month and my car tires a few times a year/in emergencies. I live in the city where space is very tight, so this is a great as an alternative to the full-size compressor I have at my shop. The unit is cheaply made, but not of abysmal quality materials. It is not recommended for frequent use, but will last a few years with light use. It is loud, but not deafening, and is fairly fast on my bicycle tires which are thin for roads. On car tires it is slow, and I wouldn't expect it to inflate any car tire past 60psi. Good value for price, great for rare uses.
1,This is a really insulting hashed together kit with vaguely useful nonsensically tiny tire levers.		metal abrasive material to scuff the rubber, and some pre adhesive applied, patches.		I really hope these poor reviews can stand as a guide to some at least to not purchase.	They simply do not work. You will have as much luck using scotch tape as you will with these patches. They do not stick or adhere in any way. They peel up upon any additional inflation or deflation.	They are incredibly thin unstretchable plastic round discs with no adhesive qualities beyond gift wrap tape.		If we are to give them the benefit of the doubt, then I can only presume that they age poorly? Something surely has to explain how they are able to continue to sell these without being sued.
1,After getting my car inspected, they couldn't get the stem caps off, so they didn't check my tires. That's problem number one. Problem number two, I lost the allen wrench, So if I didn't have another tiny allen set, I'd be screwed (haha, get it?). and third, the screws rust. Man, do they rust. In only a couple weeks, they rusted bad enough to drip rust all over my black rims, looked awful. The only plus to these are, if you leave the screws out, they look pretty nice, but that defeats the purpose. I wound up getting new ones because I prefer the round caps anyway.
1,If you use it around the burner on a stove the heat will turn it brown. I bought some Krylon high heat spray paint. Spray some on a piece of cardboard or something similar that has a coating so it doesn't dry out to fast. Take a small artists brush and touch up your spots. It took several coats to cover up my brown spots. Paint is good up to 1200 degrees F. No browning after a couple weeks. Looks good and white color is real close match to my stove. I seen other reviews that even the high heat touch-up paint of other brands turns brown around the burners also.
1,While the product was surprisingly lightweight and well fitting (medium, YZF-R6), I was sad to see it falling apart after three months.  I don't ride often, and the bike is in a shaded parking area.  I can only assume the wind would catch underneath and shake the cover to tear it apart.	This is my second cover and will be looking for a different brand with a more rugged build.
1,Don't buy these cheap HIDs, installed August 2017, lights burned out November 2017.  sad these didn't last 2 years with professional installation.  Guess you can't go cheap and expect high quality.  The 12000K light range is more 8000k range.  I purchased the anti-flicker harness with these lights too.
1,I have had nothing but problems with this junk jack since day one.  Do not buy it.  Total waste of money.  The handle and release mechanism has never worked correctly.  The "aluminum" in the description made me think it would be a lighter weight - easier to position jack.  WRONG.  It's a heavy jack and it's a piece of sh*t.
1,I agree with the other posts, the difference between running and braking isn't so great.  I was looking forward to a greater delta, and brighter overall behaviour.  Also, I just lost two (2) of these lights after only a few months...LED technology should be running much much longer...like years or decades...  Replaced with the last two spares that I had.  Well, almost, the last one will not fit the socket, looks like mechanical tolerance issues in the build of the bulb.  I will be looking for a replacement.  I like the Kolites, but looks like no 1157 is yet available.
1,These covers feel cheap and do not match the other chrome on my bike. They have an aluminum look instead of chrome. The adhesive is terrible and does not stick as advertised. I followed the directions that are included and they fall off. Terrible product, stay away.
1,Gave two stars since these are extremely bright but I purchased two sets of these and 2 out of 4 LEDs started to flicker and flash after a few minutes of use. Will contact seller
1,had to purchase a better product, did not feel comfortable trailering my harley with your product.
1,Same issue 3-4 years, the handle rubber spins around the metal. I could have added glue like others said BUT. The clicking mechanism doesn't always click and id rather not keep wrenching down on a core and cause more problems. I will stick to LISLE's $10 regular core tool
1,Very cheap, money thrown down the drain! I installed the thermocap, it went on pretty easy. Drove about 2hours, I did let the car cool down about 2hours tried to open the cap and it just spines. When I looked to find the openings to guide it out. The bottom of the cap stayed in the radiator!! It was a pain in the rear to remove without damaging my radiator. Why do people sell cheaply made products? (Do Not Buy)
1,SUCKS
1,Highly recommend you wear a respirator and protective eye glasses when using this because this stuff stinks and I doubt is good for you if you breathe it in.  Besides that, disappointed in this product, what do you need 20 cans to clean brake calipers?  I used a full can pretty quickly, it did clean the calipers, ever so slightly, but I was expecting more cleaning, especially since this stuff is suppose to be potent and in some states required to be shipped by ground.  Oh well...
1,The lights work as advertised however the mounting hardware is not stainless steel and they are rusting to pieces.  I installed them in the spring of this year and I need to get motivated to replace all the hardware while it can still be removed with a wrench and not a torch.		Do yourself a favor and change the hardware out first and repaint the mount with some rustproofing as well or you'll be in the same position before you know it.
1,I purchased this pump in June of 2017.  This review was written in November 2017.	I was hoping this would last more than 5 months.  Or at least more than three times!	Yes.  Three times.  I needed it today while on the road and I got nothing..no vibrating, no noise, nothing.		I used it exactly three times.  The first time was to see how long it would take to air up a motorcycle tire.  The second tans third times were to put air in motorcycle tires that were low.	Not at all satisfied right now. I cannot reccommend this product.  Unless of course you want to use it only a couple of times.
1,No good for frontier 2017 2 door
1,Bought 2 of these in November, 2015. As of May, 2016, both are no longer working. I expected more life considering the $5 cost per bulb. I would not buy these again. These were used in a 2007 4Runner for the 2 dome lights.
1,Not that loud for there size
1,Initial impressions were the bulbs don't appear to be genuine hella bulbs. If you're familiar with Hella products every part they sell has "Hella" imprinted or stamped. These bulbs didnt. And as expected with most hella knock offs, both died within days of each other in less than a year. And this with minimal use (car is driven mostly in the day with less than 5,000 miles per year)
1,2004 BMW Z4 3.0i	Much wider than the existing location.... tossed it into the trash
1,Unfortunately the mats inside of the box were the wrong mats and a different model number than the box itself. shipping was fine and condition of the box itself was fine. product looked fine however it was the wrong product
1,If there is an application in the off-roading world where this particular size and shape is useful, I have yet to find it.  The zipper is too short to provide easy access.  The material is of questionable durability.
1,JUNK! The spring retainers are very thin gauge metal and not spring steel, they just bend. Waste of money.
1,The fit and finish on this was pretty poor. There was rust due to bad plating inside and out on the main line, and the threaded portions were rough and seem sloppily cut. I will update review once it's installed, hopefully I can keep it from leaking.
1,Theses are so horrible and dim also bad customer service I would not recommend!
1,I've been using the SilverStar lamps for several years and have experienced many failures.  Typical lifetime is 4-8 months.  They are great for improving visibility at night but they are very unreliable and probably not worth the cost.  The high failure rate means I have to carry spares which is a little crazy at $40 per pair.  Sylvania needs to improve the reliability of this prodoct.  If you're looking for a bright headlight that will last for several years keep looking, these will disappoint you.
1,Bought a bunch of these. Wish the binding was made of a soft material. But it does soak up water after you condition them by washing them in the machine.
1,These are advertised as NEW but the TWO that I received are definitely both used. One of the hook pins is missing and I had to use a large bolt I had to be able to use it. Both of the boxes were torn open and the plastic covering the hooks on the ratchet are both gouged up like they had been used before. So just be aware that you might get used products when you order these.
1,Broke on first use. Just junk
1,UPDATED REVIEW: TAKE AWAY ANOTHER STAR! SUPER Low quality components?  Doesn't work properly! There are fewer capacitors to run the wiper delay, which also saves maybe 30 cents per unit, but they suck really bad compared to the OEM. The last Doorman wiper delay board was made in Korea, and was markedly higher quality. This one is made from inferior quality capacitors, & transistors, then dipped in so much epoxy, so no one can possibly repair it, and it is not likely to last very long. 2 weeks later and this is already not working like the OEM part. I cleaned up the old board replaced some parts and re-used it. Typical Dorman junk parts. Not the same circuit as the OEM board at all. This has 3 transistors. The OEM has 5. This has 3 electrolytic caps. The OEM has 5. The OEM also has two brick type caps .22uF rated at 250 VAC the Dorman lacks. It's a one size kinda sorta might fit your car replacement. TYPICAL DORMAN JUNK! I rebuilt Nissan ECMs after the earthquake in Japan. The same parts failed in every single unit, and repairs cost about $1 for parts and $15 for labor. Return rate: <0.05% . Return rate on replacement ECMs: <24%. If you keep making the parts with the same fatal flaws they will continue to fail. Dorman, not to be outdone, incorporates the same flaws and adds some more flaws. The lack of parts in this makes the delay settings go from 4 settings to the same as 2. The slowest setting is about every 9 1/2 seconds, the next one is about every 8 seconds, then it jumps to every 3  seconds and every 2 seconds. The OEM had a more linear response, between settings. Typical "how cheap can we get it made in Asia?", Dorman garbage. THIS VERSION ONLY WORKS ON ABOUT 35% OF THE DELAY SETTINGS ON A LUXURY EDITION OF A 1999 CHEVY BLAZER WITH POWER COMPUTER EVERYTHING! MY WIPERS WORK< BUT NOT LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO! HALF THE SETTINGS DON'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL! A MORON WHO CAN COUNT PARTS WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY! DORMAN MAKES GARBAGE! THIS IS ONE OF THEIR WORST PRODUCTS EVER!
1,Didn't fit 97 expedition
1,Spend the extra money for a heavier and more sturdy air inflator.  This is too light weight and the vibration is horrible. Trying to put the cables back into the inflator is hard and will certainly wear out the outer fabric that's on the hose trying to shove it back in when finished. The bag is too small to just leave it out. Please take my advice, you can spend a little more and get a better quality product.
1,There were NO instructions! The decal failed to transfer smoothly or cleanly. A complete waste of my money. The seller, in my opinion was lazy and sold an inferior product! I had been excited about this and then so let down by a shoddy product and poor seller support!
1,waste of money
1,I purchased this battery Nov 15th 2015 for my K5 Blazer, and it worked great upon arrival.  Working fine through the very cold winter, and into spring.  However, I let it sit for a few weeks (2-3 tops) and went to start my truck in June 2016 and the battery was dead.  I hooked up a charger and let it go overnight only to come back to the charger saying there was "trouble".  I had the battery tested and was informed it had a dead cell, maybe two.		I've been working on cars for over 20 years and this is the first defective battery I have *ever* received.  I thought I would upgrade from the Die Hard batteries I usually buy, and pay a lot more, but that was a mistake!		Fortunately, Amazon customer service refunded my purchase price of $164, and now at well over $200 I absolutely would not trust my vehicles to an Exide batter again.  Unfortunately, I also just purchased one for a Mini Cooper, and if it dies as well I will update this review!
1,Too big for my little 21 ft. RV
1,it does not seal right on three clicks i should send it back and try again
1,Can indicates 13oz. Amazon description says 14 oz.
1,I have been searching to see if I can put someone else's firmware in this box.  It often can't find destinations.  Pittsburgh airport is one, it got me to the maintenance area there... thanks. Another time, I was travelling with the family, pulling out of a parking area, it told me to turn left... sent me 6 miles up the road to turn around (no kidding) and had me drive back past the parking lot I pulled out of.  It did this again at a co-workers house.  Thankfully I had zoomed out and saw the star just to my left, because it was about to take me in a 5 mile circle.		The interface is bad.  Want to add your current destination as a favorite, good luck.  Want to find an address, well, it doesn't ask what state and city.  You may want one right near you but it shows you places 50-100 miles away.  Do yourself a favor, buy a cheap prepaid phone, go to here dot com, side load the app on your phone and download the maps you need.  You will have 10 times the GPS and have $50 in it.
1,PLEASE  READ:		For the life of me i cant understand all of these "good" reviews about this product. I must have received  something different. .........		LUGS WILL SNAP OFF UNDER MINIMAL PRESSURE.		...and the welds are questionable at best.		I used a four-way lug wrench  to tighten the spare tire to the mount and with minimal  strength  IT SNAPPED COMPLETELY  OFF! Then i decided  to try the second lug and YES it snapped off too. UNBELIEVABLE!		keep in mind that i used a small 4way lug wrench and im not exceptionally  strong.		JUST IMAGINE  MY 15 INCH SPARE TIRE COMING AT YOU AT 60 MPH AS YOU AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL  FAMILY DRIVE DOWN THE HIGHWAY.		these should be completely  recalled before someone  gets killed.		I replaced all hardware with quality parts, but that still doest remedy the actuall mount and its low quality  metal and welds.  I have removed the mount and taking it to a local welder to have it inspected. Be safe. Buy someting more expensive.		YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.		DANGER	DANGER	DANGER!!!!!
1,I ordered these based on the price and should have known better.  They are very stiff.  I have two sons that played baseball, so I put leather softner on them and ran them threw the dryer for a few minutes..an old tried and true way to soften you baseball gloves.	Even after running them through the dryer, they still seems stiff over other gloves that I've purchased.	For the price, they're adequate.
1,3" foam pads
1,Go with the JDM Astar 1200 lumen bulbs instead. They were so bright I was blinded. These bulbs I could look at and it does not put out enough light like I wanted. Better then stock though. Great build and nice quality. I just prefer the other ones.
1,bought this before a trip for oil changes on my gold wing. description is 4.4 inches high. wrong. that is before you take the insert, invert it as a funnel and screw into the end spout which is even higher. net height probably 7 inches. which does not fit under the bike. has to toss aside the funnel part and still a hole. now it has closed storage capability. amazon made good returned my money. but really, you spec. something without it being fully functional with all parts in place? duh?
1,They did not last as long as I'm used to, are these clones? Usually lasts me a whole 2 seasons but these lasted a month then never cleaned right again.
1,Sizing chart made me mad. The size amazon said will fit my car would fit a bus.	The product seems fine other wise. The door is only good if I care to adjust the drivers rear veiw mirro because it's so far foward and not usable to open the drivers door.
1,According to amazon, this was a fit for a 2009 corolla.  They did not fit the car.  Returning the product and getting a refund was no problem at all.
1,Worked fine for 8 months, then broke.  I use my parking break all the time.  The original one that came with the truck lasted 13 years, this one 8 months.  Pathetic.
1,Not very comfortable to sit on.  Adds over 1 inch of height to the seat. Cooling is not very noticeable, even on high setting.
1,This part does not fit a 2002 Chevy Avalanche With Body Cladding.
1,It does not fit my 2009 Toyota Corrola LE
1,The bulbs put out a tremendous amount of light but for some reason it doesn't make it to the road. I'm not sure how this is possible but when I replaced one with a Sylvania silverstar bulb it was very noticeable. I'd recommend going with another brand if your looking for quality light but if your going for pure white and looks only then you've found it. Another issue I had was they only last for about 2 years at best..
1,Never worked.
1,did not fit on my jeep tj !! cost me $15.00 to return them!!
1,Have one of these, along with 2 trucks (big & small) and 2 bicycles.  Auto shut-off worked great.  But last time I was airing up my tires, it quit, and won't restart.  A compressor I'd bought in 2002 for $40 lasted for 7 years.  This one was $60 in 2009, but it died after 2 years 8 months.  Now I'm back looking for a different one.
1,I really wasn't impressed with the overall result of this Polish, as part of the Mother's 3-step kit. I used all 3 steps, and still think I get better results from Tech Wax.
1,Weak sound
1,Thank heaven for the warranty. The first set lasted two months then stopped blinking. The packaging is poorly designed and both sides arrived with the wires barely hanging on to the resistor where the black heat shrink covers the wire. As you can see in the photos, the wires will bounce around in the packaging and weaken the wires.	I contacted Amazon to find out the warranty information but after three attempts over the period of a month, never received a response on the warranty. Fed up with the lack of response from Amazon, I finally called them and explained the situation then was told they would complete an exchange "as a courtesy" even though the description states the warranty is three years. I even had to send Amazon a link to the manufacturers website as proof.	I can't recommend the product as it's poorly made and the packaging is poorly designed. You'll probably have fewer headaches buying from the manufacturer if you can't live without it (and you can live without it) but you'll still have the same poor packaging. Save your money and buy a nice set of tail lights instead.
1,I have tried to like it.  But it is just to rigid of leather.  Even after months it still has not broke in.
1,Bought these for my 2015 Ram 2500 crew cab, they fit up to the point of installing rear mount. Rear mount don't match up with bar when installed in rocker panel, and when mounted on bar the mount is off line with rocker panel by 2 inches. So I have had to cut new alignment holes in my rocker panel to get accurate fit. I ha e check with Weston directly and there actually manufactured for models up to 2010. Also other sites like real truck, jegs, etc. have them list to fit my make and model also. Very disappointed!!!!
1,Makes an intermittent  buzzing noise so now I have to remove and replace again.  And this is an AC Delco part!		Update 05/09/16:  Received replacement from Amazon (thank you for trying), but it started to make the same buzzing noise again....ugh!  Works but the noise is irritating.
1,Worked for only 10 minutes then kept going on and off. Then after 5 minutes it would go off completely. One hour later it would turn on automatically then go off again in 5 minutes.
1,On a cold, rainy day in November I noticed my convertible top was soaked through so I went online and found this.  Highly reviewed and recommended on many forums. I couldn't wait to apply it, but to my dismay, when the product arrived, I found out that it has to be a warm, sunny day for it to even cure properly. The bottle says apply at 70 F and up and the forecast is all below 50 F. I think this is something that should be stated on the product info so that people don't buy and just have it sitting in their garage for months before they can use it. At this price I wouldn't want to apply it and then find out it didn't work. So here I am, still cold, still raining, it is now late January and I am just waiting for a warm sunny day to use this.
1,Make sure ALL the seats in your car/SUV will fit these. I had a middle portion on my back seats that folded down, they these would not fit on the back. The fronts worked, but the clips to secure them are cheap. Would not buy again.
1,Total junk. It came broken and, seeing how poorly constructed it is, even the ones that aren't broken will be a liability. Straight into the trash
1,This part causes more engine miss fire than the cheap one. I finally reserved to the cheaper one. I regretted returned the same one back to Pepboy.
1,ok this is an update. my friend told me about how easy it was to remove a trimax on a bike that was locked up to both wheels " i purchased one for the back and front" he broke the rear wheel lock so easily i was flustered and angered at the same time. it's looks like it's made out of hardened tin, the shackel is actual steel, but when it's locked it doesn't take much force to pop the pin LITERALLY  out of the shackel.... he didn't even have to use any tools... i literally rolled the motorcycle back and threw himself foreward and broke the shakel...		save your money, invest in something much stronger. this is a horrible product and wouldn't trust it with your new or expensive bike.
1,Well. Hooked it up about a week ago and it worked awesome just great. Then last night I came out to my vehicle to it being on blue when I never turned it on... then when I hit the power all I got were ranges of blue. So I decided sure okay. Started driving then I could change colors. Well I got a mile down the road and the thing started flashing blue, and I tried turning it off and it wouldn't so before I could get a ticket I disconnected the thing. So as far as I'm concerned I'll throw the thing in the garbage. I think I'd rather waste 38$ before I pay a ticket for running flashing emergency colors. Thanks but no thanks
1,Something must have changed at Rain-X because it's not the same as before. I remember Rain-X to be the best but it's no longer the same anymore. For each application to front and side windows, it'll last about 1-2 rainfalls/snow. It used to outlast 15-30 days, of course dependent on frequency and density of the rain/snow. I'm not sure if I can recommend Rain-X anymore. There are better products available.
1,I think this was my fault for not reading every line of the description before buying.  I saw words like wide range and universal and biting teeth...  What I missed was that it works from 3 1/8 to 3 7/8 inches... I am sure I'll use it, just not as much use as I'd hoped it would get.
1,very low light output; only for looks - does not produce sufficient output.
1,Only one led out of the two work. One of them is noticeably brighter and gets very hot. after about 8 seconds it starts to blink on and off. Other than the one bulb acting funny they are bright. I owned the JDM ASTAR Blue Led version of this and loved them. unfortunately I will have to return and get a replacement for the broken bulb.
1,Didnt work for my 01 Suburban
1,Lots of whistle, and no matter how tight you get them, they still tend to move at speeds above 40 mph. The vibration is also enough that they become near useless above 15 mph.		At least they satisfy the law, so I don't get a ticket, but as for usability they are not good. I've heard the round versions are better?
1,This FOB does not fit the 2003 Toyota Tundra as the item description states.
1,Radiator arrived twisted and mangled took awhile to get help with it
1,The ball has a small scratch on it so there goes it's beauty, a lot smaller than it looks. the thing only has tiny adapter for larger hole than the one on the ball. Really?
1,These guns look great and appear to be of high quality.  However, the first indication of a problem was the cross-threaded water filter, which would not attach to any of them.  So I ordered another water filter, no big deal.  But, when I painted with them, ugh!  They were awful.  Neither of the large guns will maintain any pressure unless the spray pattern is closed down to a circle.  As soon as the spray is adjusted the pressure just drops right off.		The result.  Poor atomization, runs, inconsistency, and a ruined paint job.  The small gun maintains as much pressure as desired (up to 60 psi).  The large ones immediately bleed off to 30 psi.  Don't know if I can return them after using them.
1,Dangerous! The wind blew these out from the tires, and sent my trailer down the driveway! I recommend buying heavy duty rubber ones that don't act as a wind sail, and want to fly away!
1,They ripped at the wrist the first time I tried them on
1,guage doesnt go low enough for atv
1,Incorrect boot for the recommended application on 2004 Nissan Altima. Purchased for use with KYB 33436 and 33437 struts.
1,Don't like it, rubber on bottom slippery, drop Ya bike messing wit this item
1,I put this belt on my Volvo V50 when I did the alternator two years ago. Unfortunately, I had to do the alternator again today (sketchy rebuilt, will I ever learn?).		Yeah, the Dayco belt was cracked on the ribs and really looking the worse for wear. I had to make a trip to the parts store and overpay bigtime for a Gates. Cest la vie, you gotta have it today, you pay more.		Not impressed. The Bando AC belt that I did at the same time was still looking good, the Dayco not so much.
1,I like these but the rear ones fell right off after the first time I washed my car.  The rear ones seem to have a small gap from the frame so the tape does not stick very well.  I am going to try to velcro them on.  The front ones work fine.  I have a 2015 Jeep Unlimited		Changing to one star, left rear one broke in half (never did get to velcro them on)
1,I purchased this to use in my auto shop, it worked perfectly initially.	The braided hose is very nice,makes the tool feel like its top notch quality, however, after some use the valve failed, as a result the equipment is unable to maintain the high reading per cylinder.		Not much else to say, currently looking for a better quality replacement.
1,Part will not fit a 2001 expedition.  Waste of time.
1,I installed these in my car in September 2016, and both of them don't work anymore. I originally thought maybe the connection, which I soldered them, but i checked them anyway and re-soldered, same thing. Originally they were blinking/flickering, which is why i rechecked the connection, and same thing. A few days later one side got dim and and a part of the halo was blinking. Then a week later the other side started doing the same thing. And then another week later, they just don't turn on, and the very few times one of them turned on, it was very dim and just turns back off. These just are not worth the time to install. Now for me to fix this, I have to remove headlights, take them apart, and remove my retrofitted projectors, change the halos, And then put everything back. This normally takes around 2-3 hours per headlight, so its very annoying. If you don't mind that these will break in a few months, and do mind redoing work, then go ahead and buy these. I had CCFL halos in my truck for 3-1/2 years not one issue, and they still work fine today. These look great but are very unreliable, I would just stick to CCFL as there is less parts to go wrong. Also to make these fit into the projector, the PCB had marks sticking out, so i had to sand it down, and then it fit. These really are not worth the time or money. For the same amount you can get CCFL halos.
1,This is old technology and geared toward old school detailers that used chamois back in the day.  I did buy one and regret my purchase.  The bottom line:  with all the microfiber towels there are on the market and a variety to choose from, this is going to be an obsolete product.  There are much, much better alternatives to choose from and much cheaper!  It's useless in my opinion.  There's a reason no one uses chamois anymore.  This requires too much prep work and maintenance.
1,So so results. Couldnt tell the difference between this and the dollar store tire cleaner except this smells a bit grapeish. Too expensive!
1,This is junk. It broke on install. I bought 4 I have two left. I have no idea why I bought them but I will never buy any such thing again.  Believe what you hear.
1,DO NOT BUY. Came with wrong size bolt for plastic handle.
1,Quality.... zero!!!
1,without comment, no work
1,I got these for the cold months and the gauntlet style sleeve - I expected a LEATHER riding glove but this is made from plastic and infused with something to make it smell like leather.  You can tell its FAKE as soon as you smell it and touch it.  I returned them immediately.  Do not buy these unless you want a cheap "pleather" glove
1,Very stiff bristles for a car wash brush. I believe this would scratch automotive paint. The bristles are flocked at the very tip, approx. 1/16 to 1/8 inch. Some bristles were not flocked at all. Use for RV's, campers, siding, etc... BUT NOT YOUR CAR!!!	I returned mine!
1,not good
1,Covers are very nice but DO NOT fit  my 2015 Renegade as Amazon said . ( They fit your vehicle ) The head rest covers do not fit any head rest. MY Renegade has a 60/40 split back seat, the cover is for a full seat. also the bottom of the rear seat does not lift so the strapps that would go under it can not be installed ?????
1,In December 2016 I purchased a P.I. Digital Tire Pressure Gauge, I used it with great success and accuracy but in April 2017 it stopped working. I changed the batteries but that did not solve the problem. Yolanda at P.I. Stores immediately sent me a replacement. Today I tried it and once again it did not work, no power to the display. I again tried to replace the batteries but still nothing. This time I am asking for a refund.		I will say when the gauge works it is very accurate, easy to ready and I like the bleed valve.
1,Hard to apply and not very dark at all.
1,This worked great for keeping the battery in my hydraulic dump trailer charged. I use the trailer about once every two weeks, and this panel kept the battery topped up perfectly. I would only rate it two stars because it lasted two years almost to the day and is now stone cold dead -- no voltage. I will be purchasing a different, less expensive five watt panel that is now available on Amazon to replace this one.
1,No extra performance .Sounds good .Fast shipping and easy simple install took 10 mins
1,The sound is awkward
1,A couple showed up with the LED eliments inside busted. The amount of light produced isn't as much as others I've bought in the past ....
1,Bought in august. It is now november. No thanks.
1,This part has already failed after being on my car for only a few days. I drive CL55 AMG. I guess it cannot handle to torque. Do NOT waste your money on this. Get either Genuine MB or Lemforder.
1,I was hoping this tool to be good, but it has poor design. In my honest opinion, the tool is way too big/tall and heavy because 50% of the time I can't take a tread reading because the tool is too big to fit in between the tire and the upper wheel walls on most of the cars I work on. This thing weighs like 1/2 pound and that's just way too heavy for a tire tread gauge. It does feel rock solid sturdier though, but it too difficult to use because it's hard to quickly retract the measuring point in between taking readings.
1,not too effective.
1,BROKE AFTER THE SECOND TIME I TRIED REMOVING THE CLIP
1,Not sure why this is supposed to be a "professional" squeegee as it is far from it. The head has a usable 7" long scrubber section and the squeegee blade is to stiff to fit the curve of a windshield. For its intended purpose it is no better than using the ones at the local gas station.		I returned the Carrand and bought a Mallory scrubber and squeegee that has a true 10" scrubber section and a much more pliable rubber squeegee and bought a Mallory 20" long plastic handle. Learned that it is better to find the best head and best handle and buy them and make your own. Mallory is definitely better made and the price is no more and often less.
1,I purchased this product (2 bottles) in an attempt to fix a slight leak from the valve cover of a Honda H22a engine (rubber seal). No improvement whatsoever over a course of 6,000 miles. In fact, the vehicle developed another leak around the distributor during this time. What did work, over a year later, was using a well known brand of high mileage oil (starts with a "V") and that sealed the leaks inside of 1000 miles.		The product itself comes out clear like water with a similar consistency. I'm aware that this may not have anything to do with its ineffectiveness.
1,The material was cheap, just as I had expected, but three out of four of these covers were coming apart at the seams due to an apparent lack of quality control. I sent them back for a refund.
1,Way too much money!!!  I regret buying these considering acid etch primer is 1/3 the price at the local auto paint store.  One can didn't spray very well.
1,This is awful! It sheds EVERYWHERE so what you clean has lint on it so what's the use in using it!!!
1,I have a Jensen vx 7020 all you need to do is run the pink wire to the rubber screw on the back of radio works perfect nobody wants to tell you this!!!!!
1,The rubber material is very thin and ripped as I tried to get it over the throttle side controls so be VERY GENTLE if you plan on buying these as you get what you pay for. The aluminum banding is also very thin so use gloves when installing.  I also had to remove the connected end cap and modify the end of the grips so that I could use my existing end caps. (not open ended). They have a nice look but unfortunately, I will have to find something more durable. On the plus side, the shipping was fast and got it sooner than expected.
1,Good for small jobs, both 120 volt a.c. and 12 volt dc is a nice option. Expect it to take a long time if airing up a car tire. Very cheap plastic case.
1,Didn't receive the one pictured. The gas cover is  attached from the outer edge buy little itty bitty screws. Pain to install. Once on it looks good. It may deter a potential thief at a glance. But you could easily pull it off by hand it about 2 seconds.		Also, the paint on the gas cover started to bubble and come off. I masked it off and shot it with Plasti Dip for the mean time.		I will upgrading to another one shortly.
1,It doesn't fit
1,no good at all
1,The recess for the pull cable is elongated, allowing the barrel to "cock" in the recess and scrape against the throttle housing, making the throttle sticky and rough. Like having cruise control (not a super good thing for a MX bike!)
1,This item is complete junk that does absolutely NOTHING for your car! 99% of the positive reviews on here are FAKE!! These have been proven time and time again to be completely bogus! Dont fall for it!
1,this did not match any of the valves I have, make sure it will work with yours before ordering
1,....had a pair of these installed a week ago on the bull bar of my truck.....worked fine...until i found myself driving in a rain drizzle...next day...i noticed a dark discoloration in the mirror reflectors in one of the lamps...i have purchased a similar lamp on amazon and the differences are quite visible....i have read other reviews where some people have claimed to have added some silicone around the lens..which i agree can be done..only if the mirror reflectors remain in stable quality....
1,Didn't fit Japanese made Toyota Corolla from 2010.
1,I read all the great reviews this had so, I bought it. Got it fast, then installed it and it made the air come out of the rear vents at full blast all the time. I couldn't turn it off unless I turned the engine off. The air was outside temp. This is a horrible product. I would rather have the broken one in so the air wasn't blowing at all.
1,Advertised as Winter Extreme but actually just the Winter wiper.  Disappointed.
1,Complete junk, one of the lens caps fell off the front in the package. Put them in my fog housings and they just barely glow. I had to send them back they didn't work for me at all.
1,On my third order, I realized there are better products in local stores, so I will not buy this at this price again; last time I buy this!
1,This product don,t work
1,The site stated that this filter would fit a 2012 Hyundai Elantra. I knew that the filter in the car has a different shape but figured it was just a generic stock photo of a filter. Nope, that is the filter you will get and it does not fit.
1,wont thread into the motor. I have aluminum heads and did not want it to cross thread. Will not use
1,Useless product. Does not seal the leak.
1,I received the hitch and found that the locking hitch pin was missing completely. Disappointed with Amazon's quality control on this one. :/
1,battery would not charge right out of box plugged in for 4 hours nothing left over night nothing.	as soon as you removed charger it died.
1,These make my cars rear end ride high, and rough.  The rear struts they sent are too long and have too many coils in the spring.  Not sure what car they were made for but they aren't for an 2002 ES300/camry.
1,squeaky....even with new rotors
1,it did not fit my 2013 sienna 7 passengers. it is about 3 inches short of width. i am not sure if i would recomand this to others.
1,Not as expected
1,The lights that worked are nice however several of them arrived cracked through the polymer and had to be soldered prior to first use.  They where crammed into a small envelope and it appears they broke as a result of this.
1,it worked great when it was received,but in one year of not being used	it failed totally  Even tried to oil the gasket.
1,Good idea, terrible execution.  Tool destroyed itself within first 10-seconds of use (brush head would not stay attached, and kept falling off).
1,Please save your time and effort and get the BMW OEM Part.  I am not a huge OEM Part fanatic and there are typically just as good parts out there for your E46 but this is not one.  Upper hose connection leaked on the first one I installed.  Requested and received a replacement, still leaked.  Ordered the BMW part and compared side by side tolerances for upper inlet nipple are way off for this item...would have never sealed.  Seller did honor replacement and refund so 1 star for that.
1,Lasted 20 minutes on my daughters ATV. Never saw water or dirt. She used it a few times and smoke came out of the mic.
1,They work, they are cheap, they fall off, they are made cheap. You get what you pay for, did I say they are cheap? Yes they are, cheap cheap cheap...
1,Too light and fragile.  Pulled over one and crushed it instead of blocking the wheel.  Get the rubber chocks at Harbor Freight for the same price.
1,Kind of a joke. Needs an additional breaker. The copper pair wire was not long enough. Had to add my own extensions to get it from the hitch to the controller and battery power. I would not recommend this kit.
1,These LED bulbs are a great idea but although they have the 1156 base (BA15S), they aren't nearly as bright as a conventional 1156 bulb. I purchased these LED bulbs to replace all of the 1156 bulbs in my RV. They don't provide enough light for my RV.		All light bulbs are rated with similar terms - 12V, 120V, 5W, 60W, and so forth. The real measure of how much visible light the bulb produces is the output of the bulb as measures in lumens. The more lumens, the more light. I took a chance by ordering these when the seller didn't offer the light's lumens. In the future I will only purchase lights that offer the number of lumens in the description. Remember that not all LED bulbs put out the same number of lumens even if the voltage and number of LEDs are the same.
1,Cheap stuff but low quality. Very poor light, far not 55 watts. No focuses some round lights. Seems like my flashlight lights better.
1,The quality of the chrome plating was terrible.  Looks more like brushed aluminum then chrome.  It is better than the rusted and pitted piece it replaces but that is very low standard.  Don't get this if you want chrome that shines.
1,doesn't fit any tie rod, pitman arm, etc...
1,I couldn't reach my plugs on my E55 AMG. I'm very annoyed.
1,Light for license plate not bright at all. Didn't care for  the break light either
1,When my original Harley battery wouldn't hold a charge I bought the Odyssey as a replacement.  The PC545 was the specified replacement for my '05 Super Glide.  This battery would not crank the engine.  Went through troubleshooting steps with Odyssey and even though the battery passed the tests they replaced it with another PC545.  This second battery also failed to crank the engine.  I finally bought another brand which had no problem cranking the engine.  Odyssey seemed to be baffled by this and actually so was I but bottom line is two new Odyssey batteries would not crank the engine and the other brand did and continues to work well.		As a side note, after the second battery failed to start the engine it took me a while to get around to trying to return the battery and as a result Odyssey refused a refund.  I understand missing the deadline but given Odyssey was notified long before the deadline of the situation I would expect they would do the right thing and refund the cost of the battery.  I also got suckered into buying an Odyssey charger because Odyssey claims their batteries shouldn't be charged with any other model.
1,It barely fits over my air filter and hard to get on
1,"Powered by Schumacker" NOT "made by". Just another once good company that whored it's name out to chinese junk. No more simple reliable basic chargers anymore just expensive microprocessor types that decide for us when to buy a new battery and lucky to last a year.	No mounting options save a flimsy plastic hook. Also can't start engine while connected so not for use as built in solution to maintain a motorhome chassis battery.
1,Looks super-sharp and very nice!  Makes the jeep look new.  And it's very easy to install.  Took less than an hour.  It's thick enough and seems like it would last a while.		Now the reason for the two-stars:  It is UNBEARABLY loud with wind noise!  Once I hit 45 MPH, it started getting loud.  At 70, it was unbearable and after ten minutes the roar it generated inside actually HURT my ears.  Forget conversation of course.  I lessened the noise a little by cracking each window a bit; i think it equalized the pressure.  Also, if you push up with your hand on the inside while driving, it reduced the noise.  But obviously I can't drive around like that.  (Perhaps a tension rod of some kind could help here?  Anyone know of one?)		If you were rarely on the highway (and even those rare times were supershort trips), then I could see this top working just fine.  But if you even semi-regularly drive at highway-speeds, you'll want to get a different top.  I've requested a return/refund for this one.
1,Poor quality. Rusts horribly and appalled that it doesn't come with the mounting kit...
1,cheap tore on top during the winter would not order again
1,Try as I might, I could not get this to work with any combination of our 4 adult bikes and 2 children's bikes. If you look around online, you'll see that many people have the same problem. There is a design flaw in this that is potentially dangerous. The part that attaches to your child's bike can very easily turn; at even a slight angle it can make the bike lean over very far in one direction, especially while turning. There is a way to overcome this, but it is NOT a quick or easy fix. You will have to go to a hardware store and buy MANY things and spend the afternoon in your garage. After all this, it will work... but unless you've got skills and time, fuhgedaboutit!
1,set screws rust
1,PISS POOR ITEM DO NOT BUY IT
1,Must be old stock. Tab broken on one and blade dried out on other
1,Leaks
1,Wow. Cheap. That scared me.  But wow amazingly bright. It says 60" but measures to be 58" oh well. Update... hooked up right. But it started to let moisture in and melted.
1,didnt fit
1,They work but do not make much light much dimmer than factory
1,The connectors to the meter is cheap product and fall off.
1,Thought I was saving a buck here with these guys vs others. Not impressed, very low light output. Quality is a concern as well.
1,This item is not vehicle specific as I was lead to believe. It does not fit well it just sits on the floor and has straps to tie into the seat base witch hopefully lines up with your truck. There is no way this item is worth the money. I don't return items or I would be sending this back. My advise is don't no waste your money on this item
1,This is unbelievable, I thought I was buying from a reputable brand. This is my 2nd energizer (Or I guess Power Bright is their manufacturer) inverter. I got the 1st one earlier this week. It was returned the day it was received because one of the 120V wires coming off the main board hasn't attached, it had come off (It was holding on by 1 strand). The replacement came in today, first thing I checked was that wire through the grill slots, it was attached. Plugged it in to my car battery (via the attached clips), powered up just find. Attached a 50w LED work light (50 watts load at the plug, not 50 watts light output), worked just fine. Fan didn't power up. Attached a 175-200 watt load (my Dremel Rotary Tool, it pulls 1.5A (I've tested this with a DMM)) with the LED light. There was a sizable arc inside the unit. It continued to arc, followed quickly by a FIRE and a lot of smoke until I removed the positive terminal of the battery from it. Looked like a fool trying to blow through the fan opening to put it out, then quickly snapped a pic with my phone..unbelievable. This is suppose to have the usual safety circuitry built in , NONE of it worked as designed, it continued to short internally with my battery connected. This is a DANGER to anybody who uses it with high loads. I seriously question the engineering design and manufacturing if I had 1 dead on arrival and the 2nd caught on fire due to some internal fault (I'm not going to take it apart to see which component failed). Its totally unacceptable.		Oh and if anybody says that dremel was too much for it. I've measured it pulling 1.55A at 110V (modified AC sin wave) from my Cobra 500watt power inverter I have permanently mounted in my car, you know the $25 dollar one on amazon right now. I use it on that thing frequently with no issues. I stepped up to energizer thinking it would be a good product, but the dirt cheap one that I've had a year or 2 works better.
1,works well but was missing one clamp
1,I ordered this for my 2014 RAM 1500, but it does not fit unless you slightly block the spare tire opening.	Make sure you get the correct item before ordering.
1,I Have purchased several kits over the past 2 months and it seems every single kit i get has a bad ballast or bulb wiring not correctly manufactured. i had one ballast actually electrocute me. I Install these kits for my customers and getting real tired of having to return the kits just to find another defect in the kit i receive out of the last 6 kits i have ordered 5 of them had 1 ballast not working. and the other kit had bad wiring in the bulb.
1,This rack does function but not nearly a good as the standard J-Rack. I traded for a smaller car with factory cross-bars. None of the eaily removable rack adapters would work properly.  The fold-down feature allows me to garage the car but still load my kayaks quickly for a trip to a local lake.  The lower arm is shorter and does not curve up as the standard J-Rack.  The result is that it is easier for the kayaks to fall if not strapped quickly, especially if the is a lite breeze. The fall off occurs with 3 foot c-c as well a 2 foot; straight cross rail or curved.	A standard J-Rack on a trailer works great.		If I were to recommend it I would add qualifications. It might work with extrmely narrow kayaks not the 29 inch wide Pungo or others of similar with.
1,First take a shallow or deep metric or SAE socket to see what exactly fits.  A 1996 Ford Contour needs to use the 18mm spark plug socket wrench, like the Motion Pro Spark Plug Socket 18mm with 12 points and an end that will accept a 13/16 crow foot flare nut wrench for torquing the strut nuts back on.  12 points and flare nut crow foot wrench will have better grip, than a 6 point. Although the 6 point wrenches and sockets are cheaper, and you'll want to have the spring coil compressed all the way any way, but 12 points are just better to avoid rounding the nuts off if they're not impact sockets.		The adapter here is for a 3/4" strut nut.  Cannot see how it works if you have to hold the strut rod with a 6mm allen wrench while turning the strut nut counter clockwise/clockwise with a 13/16 combination wrench (taking it off) or 13/16 crow foot flare nut wrench (putting on) the crow foot goes on a torque wrench to specific pound. Then you install it back on the car/truck, then torque the strut nut on top, sticking out under the hood. You have to hold the strut rod with the allen key either taking the nuts off or on and to torque them back on.		You'll use the crow foot wrench set any way, but you can buy them single.
1,Not sure what Toyota it works with, but not even the Toyota dealer could read or program it.
1,I have had them on my truck for less then 6 months and they are all pitting from the inside with rust. Must have a thin chrome coating would not recommend. Wish they would honor a replacement guarantee.
1,Cheap - buttons don't fit in the shell. Tore because the materiel is so thin.  Have bought others that I was happy with - not this one!
1,Edited 7/27/15 - I have had the cover on and off for a few months and now that it has been exposed to the weather the silver poly has dried and is cracking apart all over. Just trying to uncover and recover my vehicle it breaks apart! The thing has turned into a total waste of money. I'll pay more for a better cover made of better material next time.		I bought this to cover one of my 2003 Honda CR-V's and it fit great even with a roof basket and the factory grill trim and rear door mounted spare tire. The cover was able to pull down and nearly cover the wheels as well. I did have to unscrew the radio antenna (no big deal to reinstall when I drive the car) but I plan to replace that with a short flexible rubber unit that will fit under this cover. The material is durable but poly-based so be careful not to stretch or pull too much as it will thin out some in the spot you pulled. The straps are very good under the bumpers on my vehicle.
1,They work but aew made of EASY to break type of plastic
1,I would not give this product a star if i could. Went to put air in my motorcycle tires today and this thing would just spit out air from the air hose and it won't sit in the tire stem. Only purchased it about 8 months ago. I was expecting it to work a bit longer than 8 months. Pretty disapointed.
1,Like other reviewers said, size is more like kids size. Don't buy if you have a normal sized man head. I am 5' 10' tall and 180 lbs.
1,I got the K&N for my 01 Grand Marquis. I was skeptical for a long time but seeing Amazon's lower prices vs Autozone I decided to give it a shot. I was hoping to see an increase in gas mileage. Unfortunately it had the exact opposite effect. With a paper STP I can get my car to average 24.5-25.5 mpg when driving conservatively. With the K&N filter in I saw my mileage immediately drop to 23.5. I put the paper filter back in and just got 25.5. When driving 400 miles a week that equals 1.02 gallons/week.. So with gas at $3.80/gallon after 2 weeks the savings from this "lifetime filter" has exceeded the cost of a paper filter from increased gas consumption... I reset my trip odometer every time I fill up and even while driving, comparing the gas gauge to the trip odometer I could see the KN was reducing my MPG. As for power, maybe a little at WOT but that's it and with this car it's got enough stock power so you really never have to push it to WOT.		So there you have it. Maybe these other people have had their mpg go up...or maybe they're driving more conservatively after the KN cuz they're paying more attention to their gas consumption/driving style and want to see it pay off. Buyer beware...
1,Not happy lots of scratches and scuff marks. Tape missing on two
1,It's a great starter kit, but both kits I ordered had LEDs out.		I took strips from both and created a functioning kit. I'm returning the others for a new kit.
1,junk...don't buy...lasted a week....wasted money
1,Junk. Don 't buy.
1,This is too thick for headlight it mirror tinting and does not apply well at all. Spent over 2 hours trying to work it on the headlight with all the proper tools, squeegee/heat gun/razor etc and it just creased itself and looked awful versus a regular vinyl that can be manipulated and pliable.
1,We fulltime. Takes about 2 weeks for this to clog. Cleaning it is a major pain.	$1000 A/C protected by $.01 worth of plastic.	Dometic, again, should be ashamed.	And they vend that $.01 of plastic for 1000 times what it took to make it.	Fits okay, for 2 stars.
1,Tiny thin cheap
1,Junk. Very loose fit in a Jeep TJ
1,Worked for my project but the metal is not high strength and this will not last. I would avoid it.
1,If you have a Ford Fiesta, the ends of the wiper do not touch the glass effectively reducing the wiping area. Not good.
1,Kinda Small .. Well Really Small .. Thought it would be bigger :(	If fact its sooooo small that you can not really see what it is !  LOL
1,I needed a switch and this fit the bill, but it arrived dead.  I ended up getting one from good 'ole Waytech.
1,I have 6.5 jl speakers. the bass was much better without these.
1,Product arrived fine. But it disnt fix the leak. This product leaks too
1,I ordered these for my 2001 Ford Escape. Amazon says that these will fit my model car. Not one of the 3 actually fit on the knob prong. One comes close, but it doesn't match the original equipment and the knob backlight does not shine through it like the original equipment. Returned these for a refund.
1,NOT WATERPROOF! doesnt work anymore. not since the first rain day
1,Way too small, need to make it bigger. Also very hard to get eyeholes to line up. Can't really use it safely.
1,This will not fit ultra classic electra glide. It will hit the rear brake light and will not mount even though before i bought it specs says it will.
1,These mirrors shake while driving! Wasted $133
1,After first wash plastic fibres poked thru. Did a little bit of paint correction for free today
1,Sounds like whistle when the cars on. only when you rub your engine it sounds like turbo and the insert flys off with the rattling of the exhaust
1,material came apart month after purchases I only weight 170 pound so shouldn,t have been weight. not happy at all with purchases
1,It didn't work on 03 Hyundai GT to clear airbag light. Called customer service who told me to update the tool online. I tried several times and with two computers (PC) without success. I read that updating the tool is not easy even if I couldve established a connection with the server. Youre supposed to register the tool, download a program. Install it. Then run it and download a file onto a SD card. Then put that SD card in the tool and upgrade it. Perhaps this tool is great with another car, but didn't work for me.		What really work great was Amazon. When I requested a return, Amazon sent a label and free ups return. Refunded the $ within hours. Very happy!!! Go Amazon, the future of all online purchases one day!!
1,I sprayed this over painted plastic that I thourghly prepped before I applied this, even took the time to wait 12 hrs between 4 layers it held up for about a months before it peeled off in spots.  This may work well in areas where there is no abrasion or even washing.  I was over all disappointed with this considering all the time I put into applying this.  I will be sticking with paint from here on out.
1,These weren't much brighter than the original dome lights in my 1998 Toyota 4Runner. Lights also flickered sometimes.
1,Too flimsy to be of use.  No way to compensate for seat position (recline).
1,crap won't work on 2001 dodge 5.9 call super chips
1,Unhappy with the results. New rotors should not have runout issues, but these do. As stated in other review, both front hub bearing assemblies replaced along with these front brake rotors. Still have runout issue when braking immediately after replacing. As stated 40+ years of repair experience, These parts should have corrected issue but didn't. I'll have to get rotors resurfaced which I could have done with old components, but I said just replace them been in use since 2010.
1,ok this is an update. my friend told me about how easy it was to remove a trimax on a bike that was locked up to both wheels " i purchased one for the back and front" he broke the rear wheel lock so easily i was flustered and angered at the same time. it's looks like it's made out of hardened tin, the shackel is actual steel, but when it's locked it doesn't take much force to pop the pin LITERALLY  out of the shackel.... he didn't even have to use any tools... i literally rolled the motorcycle back and threw himself foreward and broke the shakel...		save your money, invest in something much stronger. this is a horrible product and wouldn't trust it with your new or expensive bike.
1,Do your reseasrch. If you have a 6.0 these will not work! Yes they fit, but they don't filter the oil because they are not long enough to shut off the by pass valve.
1,deodorizes fine, but very poor on break down
1,It works,, but it does not light up very bright and in the sunlight becomes useless
1,I put these on my wife's HHR....	They went bad pretty quickly! Not even a years use.	I replaced them with some shocks from autozone with a lifetime warranty....	This is my first disappointment from KYB and I have installed them on many vehicles....
1,the left camshaft sprocket do not fit. very disappointed
1,Idk how these h13 led bulbs are getting high marks because they are not very good at all.terrible beam pattern.
1,Most of the time I really like everything that I buy from Amazon including stickers. etc. I was really disappointed to the printing qualify of this sticker for what I paid for. The quality of the paper is great (5 Star), but I will definitely get rid of that printing machine that you guys used to print this. The picture was bad.
1,I got a bad set, oh well that's why you return stuff.
1,Too much intake noise.  Awful. It did Increase throttle response.
1,order these (2 sets) and just received 1 set and was billed for two can't seem to get power sports to deliver my 2nd set now what do i do i have e-mailed power sports and stiill nothing
1,When mine arrived, there was no "i" in the word "misbehave", only the dot, so the decal was useless.
1,It's completely white 6000k...which I don't like...I bought	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006R0XYGY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1	from YupbizAuto seller	which have blue tint about 8000k of white...more relaxed than this product...however,it can't beat by the price 6$ for 4 led...so cheaper compared to others....	But actually you get what you pay for....I highly recommend 2pcs as the link on the top...It's worth for your money...	I didn't use any of 4 LEDs.
1,Had to return because it didn't fit my truck.
1,The lettering is too thick for my taste.
1,didnt need it could not send it back
1,stopped working after one day.  replaced with part from local parts store.
1,I was so excited to put this on but my order did not come with bolts. Stock bolts are too short. Looks good when I dry fit it
1,Didn't work for my car but it said it does.
1,did not come with sensor pictured and terminals were different so they could not be swapped to old connector	I received denso #234-4012
1,Stupid!!!  The 4.9" measurement includes the rope....WTH??  Very deceptive pics, I've been happy with a few MP products but this is ridiculous, the flipping tool is about an inch long, deceptive trade practices........it sucks just used it and the gears on my Honda chewed it up pretty good.  I'll be lucky to get 2-3 more uses out this PO ESS
1,I got about a year and a half out of these bulbs, they died a few days apart. The original bulbs with 5 years of use on my car went back in. They're not very expensive but not really worth the money. They are a little whiter than stock H11's but don't hold a candle to HID in output or color, the blue wrap on them is just a gimmick.
1,Piece of junk.
1,This cannot replace the OEM product.
1,Way too big lol. Didn't expect that wow
1,did not fit my quad wanted to mount it on the rack on the front of my quad would not fit needs to be a little more universal somehow
1,The product arrive whit a different retail box; the glue tape don't arrive whit the product and now I can use.
1,The range is not far. Apart from that its good. So if you live in a compound that is large do not waste your money on this one. If your house is enclosed then you can by this.
1,Lasted a week, cheap foam material.
1,I put this on a 2003 Mini Cooper. It did not fit exactly and needed a bit of trimming which I was ok with. It looked ok for a little while but eventually started changing colors. It now looks like a really dirty brown stained version of itself. Considering I had to trim it and it didn't last long with out changing colors and now needs to be removed and cleaned up I would say all the work was not worth it. Skip the gas cap cover if you are going with the checkered pattern.
1,Disappointing,  it look like my factory lights.
1,Nice looking but was not able to use it on my Mercedes-Benz because it won't stay in place.
1,The installation was a breeze however I am very disappointed in the way the tailgate drops. It goes down pretty fast and I still have to hold my hand there to stop it. I was expecting it to drop much slower than the way it does. I do not trust it without my hand there guiding it down. If I would have known this then I would not have bought it. I love the idea but this did not meet my expectations.
1,Don't order this Through the Roof Sealant.  It is very difficult to 'brush' on to a surface.  It is thicker than honey.  Plus, Amazon shipped mine in a too large box loosely along with two other products that I had ordered.  The can was badly dented-in and the lid was almost impossible to re-close after opening.  Also, the loose can damaged the other products beyond usage....crushed.
1,too long to get into tight spaces.
1,My Putco Chevy Silverado stainless steel fender trim came with only six metal clips. It requires sixteen for the install 4 per fender. I contacted Putco about the problem I was told to report the problem to amazon.
1,does not fit bikes the rpoduct claims to fit,  have 2 bikes and these wpouldn't work for either one of them.
1,first 2 work great 3rd one is garbage finally unboxed it for the snowmobile battery and low and behold does not work and of course out of warranty I did try this on more than one battery and double checked it with a volt meter I will not order any more really a buyer beware
1,Burned out after a month or two
1,They drove fine, and were not particularly hard to mount. The did not last at all. I bought a used car with mismatched tires. Two were half worn down Michelins, and two needed immediate replacement. Toyos, I think. I replaced the worn tires with the Kumhos, and they are already worn down to the cord. The original half worn Michelins are still half worn. I bought more Michelins this time. I wish I knew exactly how many miles it took to wear these down. But not that many. When my wife told me that her tires were worn down, I was really surprised, and even more surprised to find out that the ones worn out were the new ones.
1,Ok
1,I was excited when they showed up.  But the damn things didn't fit well kept sliding off.  Head pieces couldn't fit the head rest. Eventually my wife threw them in the garage and that's where they are until this day.  Talk about a waste of money.
1,At first these bulbs were great. Nice and bright. But then after about a month I started to notice the individual leds on the bulb start to go out. Now 3 months later there's not a single bulb without a row of leds not lighting.
1,Had to return. Did not fit under the seat of my 2014 Wrangler JK 2 Door Sport
1,I didn't notice this working as suggested on my vehicle and it left a greasy film on any glass that got oversprayed; finally, this stuff smells horrible. I won't buy it again.
1,Stopped working in a matter of weeks.
1,This mitt is a bit thinner than I expected and doesn't hold as much soap/water as I had hoped.  When you pull it out of the bucket, it really just drains off quickly, so you have to hurry and get it onto the car.  Also, it's white, so it shows dirt and grime very quickly as you wash.  I was surprised at how much grit and grime actually stuck to the mitt, even though I was using the 2-bucket method.  It just didn't wash off in the rinse water.  My old trusty microfiber sponge worked better than this mitt, unfortunately.  And the grit and grime rinsed right off the sponge, but not this mitt.  Another dud from Meguiar's (see my Water Magnet review).
1,Adhesive backing is visible and white while on car, good thing my paint is white or it would look weird
1,The one from red hound auto is cheaper and way better. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess.
1,Items arrived ahead of schedule.		Did not work.
1,Ive had these in just under a month and loved them, until one already went out today. Not sure if its the bulb or ballast but its out already!
1,Its a bad cap. Its only worth it for 2 in a half months cause mine just broke
1,Very displeased with the light after only 12 hours of being on the vehicle four of the led lights have already quit working. With that being said it is very bright and seems to be well made. Maybe I just received a bad light. You can see the four lights not working in the picture
1,This junk should really get zero stars from me!  I looked at it online, read the reviews and figured it would be the product to remove some light scratches from my dark blue colored car.  I washed the car and applied the Scratch Doctor as directed.  Nothing changed.  Nothing.  I rubbed harder.  Nothing.  I added more of the goop and rubbed again.  Absolutely nothing happened but my arm getting a great work out and me breaking out into a sweat.  I paid $10 bucks for a tube of crap.  Don't bother with this stuff.  If you have scratches, go to the body shop and get them to fix them.  Plain and simple.
1,Sorry....This Is The 3rd Email----REMINDER....The Dang Compressor...".NEVER PORKED"!!!!  From Day Got It...n PluggedINTO 4 Diff Cig-Liters....SoJustReported Back To Amazon/Product Contr....So GotRefund Credit...n TOLD To Dump It...Yes, I Did!  Piece O Junk! LesH
1,The ratchet locking mechanism literally broke after i got the first piston in.  Tried to use it with the mechanism not lucking and beat my head against the wall.  Bought another style.  I strongly do not recommend this product.  If you are like me (maybe you are and maybe not), i have limited time to build my project and this just set me back a couple weeks.  Awesome!
1,The problem is the resin never really seeps into the cracks. I followed the instruction to the letter. Now it looks the same as before. No difference before and after. My only consolation is I paid only $10.93 inc. shipping. At the Auto Show, a vendor was selling this same product for $20. Now I have to save and pay for a new windshield...
1,While the quality seems decent, it isn't until you wire them up do you realize these are terrible. The bulb is irreplaceable, the pins seem to be cold welded to the wiring and can't be unsoldered and in addition the wires are clamped permanently down inside the bulb's enclosed fixture so you cant replace it either (I know this because I completely tore and bent the metal enclosure apart to inspect everything. No swapping to LEDs or anything... You're stuck with halogen and if it burns out, you're screwed period.		Speaking of LEDs, the ring around the projector is poorly designed and utilizes the older style of LEDs like these&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Chanzon-100pcs-10-colors-x-10pcs-5mm-Light-Emitting-Diode-LED-Lamp-Assorted-Kit-for-Arduino-Warm-White-Red-Yellow-Green-Blue-Orange-UV-Pink-Lights/dp/B01AUI4VSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Chanzon 100pcs (10 colors x 10pcs) 5mm Light Emitting Diode LED Lamp Assorted Kit for Arduino Warm White Red Yellow Green Blue Orange UV Pink Lights</a>&nbsp;which are a very poor choice for vehicular applications due to their poor light output when compared to High Power LED chips normally used in vehicles. These can not be used for DRL's as they have zero output during the day time.
1,I had to re-gap 6 of the 8 plugs, which is difficult with Iridium . They came decently packeged. I just got them installed and have not had to the to experience what they offer as far as performance on my g8 gt.
1,Only one out of 2 keys worked and you don't know until after you pay to get them cut
1,UPDATE... I tested it with a jump box when I gave my review... But as as I spent a ton time mounting, running wires. Installing a switch it stopped working. It currently will not light the center 3 light modules will not change to anything the end lights steady burn. It will on and off, but that's it. I'm very unhappy and can no longer recommend product. .........Brighter then I thought for a $40 light. Luckily the pattern I would use is the first pattern seeing how it does not have recall. Also does not have a pattern from left to right or right left. But for what it is in very happy. Will certainly consider future purchases of this brand.
1,These are not bad or poor quality lights, but they are not worth it.	They are not bright at all, in fact the factory incandescent bulbs are much brighter. Then to fix the hyper flash issue when switching to LEDs you need to spend more money on capacitors and a secondary wire harness unless you want to ruin your factory ones with wire taps.		There is no benefit to this upgrade other than the lifespan of the bulbs.

'' Uploaded New Video to show that the cable is Defective - FEB.10.2016 ''		iDealShopper rate this at 2 Stars.		* Video attached has no narrative by me, I just wanted everyone to see and hear why this is a Defective unit, to bad customer service doesn't exist as I wanted to test this unit out *		There are only 1% of products that I have ever given a 2 star or less. Unfortunately I have no choice but to leave this 2 star rating for the following reasons. While I like the LCD displaying the amount of charged left, the safety jumpers and the nice design of it. I could not test this Power Bank Jumper because the cable it came with is DEFECTIVE. Everything else on this Power Bank works, just not the jumper itself and that is the main purpose of this purchase.		The way you use this Power Bank Jumper is by connecting the jumper to the Power Bank 1st. What this does is it does a Error Check on the cable and lets you know when you could do the jump by displaying a GREEN light. Mine didn't do that, instead it just kept on BLINKING GREEN & RED Lights.		So then I decided to attempt another method of connection these jumper cable, but connecting it to the car's battery 1st. What that also does is it starts the Error checking again on the cable to make sure it is ready for the jump. And once again it continues to BLINK GREEN & RED and doesn't stop. So I went to YouTube and discovered that Suaoki does have some manufacturing problems with these cables and if it doesn't stop BLINKING GREEN & RED, you CANNOT start the jumping process at all.		I emailed Suaoki days ago, waited for a response and nothing came back. My email contains a hidden signature that when read, I get a notification. Suaoki read my email but have decided not to respond to this issue. It also appears that I am not the only one in here with a defective unit. So I have to return this unit back to them via Amazon.		I have uploaded some Images and Video to Amazon that might not show up right away. Amazon has since change how they process these and when it will show up on the reviews. Please be patience. Thank You.		I purchase these at a discount price for an honest & unbiased review. (I know you hate to read that part, but my review are always honest, if the product is not good, then it won't get the stars it deserved). My discount was increased without notice and I ended up paying more than I should of.
1,Cheap sponge.
1,Wrong size wrong product....
1,These are seriously the WORST headlights ever. Sure, they are a bit brighter than the cheap, OEM ones, but it comes at a huge cost in the life of the bulbs.		These burn out fast. Very fast. After some research, it seems that the Silverstar headlights are supposed to burn around 300 hours. The cheapie headlights last around 1000 hours.		So let me get this straight: I'm paying $25 per bulb for 300 hours when I could be paying $7 per bulb for 1000 hours?! All for a bit more light output?!
1,Good price but very slow upload
1,How is the yellow caps for ford and gm supposed to stay on the filler neck it has noe threads to secure it to the neck ? Mine leaks when under a vacuum unless you push down hard on the cap to make it seal on top of the power steering pump neck . Why doesn't it thread on to the neck ? So then I would not have to be holding it in place.
1,They are ok but not very thick like the old tempo ones. I guess better than nothing. What happened to quality.
1,Did not stay secure on my 06 cobalt. Always loosen
1,As others have mentioned, product showed county of origin as USA.  However, it came today in a bag marked "Made in China".  The listing really should be updated for accuracy.  I don't have a problem paying $10+ for a bent piece of metal, if it's made here.  Very misleading and annoying.
1,No good, this was the second batch of supposed #1076 bulbs from a different company. Lights look great but don't turn on due to the ground being wired to the bulb base and not the terminal like even the pictures show in the description. These are wired like a #1157 bulb but have a #1156 base so are even worthless as a taillight bulb, as i said this is my second order with a different vendor  with the same results. I guess the origional factory must have screwed up building these, maybe if they would have put a part number on them it would help. I wasted allot of time waiting and messing around with these bulbs.
1,Did not do anything at all I was half tempted to take them apart and see if there was anything inside
1,Overpriced straps. Make sure you don't just strap your bike down then head on a trip. For the first 1000 miles they kept stretching.
1,I agree with the other reviewers.  Can't recommend this product to users due to the smell, especially when you put it on FRESH.  I also waited a few days to see if the smell would be gone, but it didn't.  I'm not surprised since it uses a spray for cleaning and reusing.
1,6 out of 10 bulbs worked when I received them. The company is sending me out replacements which is nice. The ones that do work are nice and bright.
1,Appeared to stop water but it was Really noisy material and the fit was horrible the Medium was like an XL. I ended up returning it. For not too much more you can get a little better quality
1,The color as DRL(daylight running light) is yellow like any other halogen bulb.  Only full brightness at highbeam is close to 4000k.  Very disappointed to have not known this disclaimer. Photo on the left is regular; on the right is CrystalVision.
1,Disappointingly cheap. No mounting hardware included  to fit the included screw caps. No locating tabs to keep the frame tight against the plate and its also too narrow overall, will not adequately fit a 50-State plate.
1,Cheap junk.  Do not buy.  Bought for a 2000 S10 Blazer door panel and half of them broke after a week of use.
1,Search for "smh10r will not play media" on the Sena support forums....this is NOT an isolated incident.		I wanted to step up from my 3 year old freedcon bt system for my modular helmet due to short battery life and a proprietary charger, so I bought this. Error. Terrible error. Half the time it doesn't want to connect to the Sena Bluetooth Device Manager and it NEVER connects to my media. I wanted this 90% for the ability to play music, and 5% for phone calls and 5% navigation prompts. It only handles phone calls, so is a nearly complete waste. Now I'm left to foot the bill for returning all of the related accessories I bought on my own dime, as they are private sellers on Amazon.		 Off to a brick and mortar who not only sells this exact unit for thirty percent less than here, but will also get me a 100% functional unit on the spot if I so choose. That said, I'm going a different route after this. You had one shot, Sena, and you failed abysmally. My little forty dollar 3 year old freedcon smokes you. Shameful.
1,Have not had it very long.  Can't get information on the coad it brings up.  You have to buy the information on repairs.
1,I am not impressed with these things at all.  It takes a lot of finagling with them to get them where they are at just the right length and hooked up just right and setting at the right place on the ski to work, which is not the easiest thing to do when you are setting idle in fairly decent size waves like on the busy lake we use. I would not buy them again. It could be they work like a charm on another ski though, maybe it is just the size and shape of ours that makes them not work so well (Sea Doo Sparks).
1,Do NOT install these or ANY type of xenon, LED, or colored bulb inside a HALOGEN REFLECTOR HOUSING! IT IS ILLEGAL AND DANGEROUS. THE ASSEMBLY WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR IT. It cause severe glare, blinding other drivers! And runs the risk of setting fire to your vehicle, as (again) THE OEM HOUSINGS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR THESE!!	WHITE ONLY. NO BLUE. And there is no such thing as a "30,000 Kelvin" bulb... Your wouldn't be able to see it, because that temperature is up I the ultraviolet spectrum!! You'd actually be blinded!
1,Garbage
1,Ehhh.... Works but in jersey where others pump your gas.... half the time they pull it off anyway
1,Ok so I gave this a good review but now I put it on my truck and it not rain or water proof so do not use it in a rainy states  worked good for the day but little water hits it and it's done for thank
1,After looking at other manifold sets, I decided on this set since it's made in the USA.  On receipt, I attached the hoses and high/low side EZ-Snap connectors.  When checking out my 1999 Subaru Outback, the low side connector snapped in place with no leaks.  I clicked the high side connector in place and heard Hisssssssssss.....leaking.		To Mastercool's credit, I had a replacement high side EZ-Snap connector mailed to me just two days after calling their toll free number.  The replacement connector came in today's mail.  Back out to the old Subaru.  Low side snapped in place with no leaks.  My spiffy new replacement high side connector snapped in place and....Hissssssss.....leaking.  It should be noted that my years-old cheapie "Quest" (EF Products) R134a valve/hose/single pressure gauge setup attaches to this same port with no leaks whatsoever.		So I tried pushing/pulling/rotating the EZ-Leaky-Lousy-Snap connector.  I eventually managed to get it to stop leaking by rotating it to juuuust the right position.  It leaks when the high side pressure is only ~70 PSI on the 1999 Outback.  When I attached it to my 2013 Subaru Forester high side connector, it showed no leakage at ~150-200 PSI.  This suggests to me that their valve needs a good bit of pressure on it from the R134a system to seal properly (NOPE - see UPDATE 6/5/16, below).		Sorry, but this is not what I expect when I buy a Mastercool product.		UPDATE 6/5/16....it looks like the high side EZ-Snap connector leaks BADLY (hissing coolant, dripping oil) even at 145 PSI on the 1999 Outback fitting. Of course, the old Quest hose/gauge didn't leak at all when I added coolant through the high side port after evacuating the system.		The high side EZ-Snap connector also puked oil & pressurized coolant after I snapped it back into the manifold "hose holder" port. The low side didn't leak at all. Yeah, Mastercool quality!		UPDATE 6/15/16...I've given up on the Mastercool EZ-Snap connectors on our Subarus.  I returned one of the high side connectors to Mastercool for their evaluation.  They "checked and rechecked the coupler, found no issue."  Yup, no issue, other than leaking coolant/oil on the 1999 Outback, leaking also on the 2013 Outback, leaking also on Mastercool's own manifold hose holder.  No issues at all!  I've switched the Mastercool EZ-Snap connectors on my manifold over to a set of YXGOOD manual couplers (&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/YXGOOD-A-C-Air-Condition-Quick-Coupler-Adapter-High-Low-Manifold-Freon-Connector-R134A/dp/B012ZC7RVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">YXGOOD A/C Air Condition Quick Coupler Adapter High&Low Manifold Freon Connector R134A</a>&nbsp;).  The YXGOOD couplers work on all four of our Subarus, and also attach to the Mastercool manifold hose holder with no leakage.
1,My car has been charging for 35 minutes and it barely turns over.	The "car start" to be used as a way to jump start the car does not work.	The firm has no internet website and thus no support at all....they know	they would be overwhelmed with complaints so they said the hell with it.	We know we sell crap and if people will buy it then its their problem	I would not buy this for anything other than as a weight to keep the newspapers outside	from flying around the neighborhood.
1,After using this for month it left a nasty white film on plastic trims. That film is very hard to remove. Be aware!
1,They would not turn completely off.
1,This WAS (see my update below) an excellent buffer, representing real and true VALUE for what you get.  And what you get is orbital consistent power in one hand that allowed me to wash, wax and polish my huge SUV (Nissan Armada) in just under two hours. My old 6" buffer had to be replaced due to the on/off switch becoming inoperable which is disconcerting to put it mildly.  The Ryobi is smooth, consistent and stays with you on the job without jarring your bones to the core (unlike the old buffer).		For those of you thinking that bigger is better in the buffing world?  Think again.  You need a 6" buffer like this one to hold in one hand, while the other hand squirts out the Mother's Caranuba wax (highly recommended) as needed.  It speeds up the process considerably as opposed to stopping each time you need more wax as would be the case when using a 8-9" two hands buffer.  Believe me, I've gone down that route in the past as well without good results.  I just use the Ryobi to apply the wax, work on sections of my car, rest a couple of minutes, then take off the dried wax manually with a soft microfiber towel.		This procedure works well for me and doesn't leave those dreaded swirl marks oft-times left behind by the buffer.  But wait you say!  How do you go about applying wax on the fly to the lower parts of the car like the doors and rear quarter panels located near the tires?  It's tricky and takes a little practice but I find success by squirting the wax slightly above the area I want to buff in, then quickly move the buffer over that area and work my way downward.  Probably more information than you needed but there it is.  This is an excellent buffer.  That's where I came in, so happy waxing everyone!		UPDATE:  I bumped the buffer accidentally with my foot recently, causing it to take about a 1 foot fall off the bottom rung of a step ladder and that was it: FINI!  As in broken beyond repair.  I took it to a small engine repair shop in hopes that it was something benign but was told the unit was not worth the necessary repair costs which miffed me to no end!  Now maybe this was a rare anomaly of some kind but I'm now wondering about the overall build quality of a unit that would break so easily.  Be advised and because of it, I'm taking down my recommendation to the 2 star level.
1,Not sure if its the circuit board is bad , but didn't work for me
1,wrong one
1,Worked for two weeks, were bright when they worked......one quit, then the second one stop working as well.
1,Didn't do what i needed it to do. It said it would make it where my bright indicator would light on my dash after I installed led headlights. Well it didnt. I would suggest trying a higher quality product.
1,Terrible.  I followed instructions to a T and none of my windows will shut with them.  Very disappointed.
1,ALTHOUGH THE BULBS FIT INTO THE HOLE AND PLUG, IT IS ABOUT 1/16 TOO LONG.
1,junk.
1,The wipers themselves clean off the water nicely, but on my Ram 1500, the drivers side when driving lifts and the wiper misses the lower left portion of the windshield. And to boot, on the drivers side once the blade hits far left and comes back, it brings backwash with it back to the windshield. I have had Rain-X Wiper Blades before  and this is the first time I've had issues with them.
1,Didn't fir properly and kept popping off. Springs came off way too easy.
1,I bought this to kill the smell of swamp mud in my Jeep and It didn't work so well. I left the lid off and still couldn't smell it .
1,Not even close to OEM quality. The plastic pulley wheel seems very brittle and cheap
1,cover 2 people don't make me laugh almost don't cover one would not keep you warm maybe with another blanket
1,I was surprised to find a pair of gloves that a child had simply removed the fingers with a pair of scissors.  Rough edges, poorly sewn, and ill-fitting.  Not at all what I expected...but then, you get what you pay for.  The seller did apologize and refund the purchase price.  Spend a little more to get a quality product.
1,After buying 3 different squeegee's from Amazon based on 4 star glowing reviews, I have determined that all these people must have stock in these companies. Please check out all my reviews of these worthless products. This squeegee has double lips on it creating a chattering noise that will wake everybody in the house if you shower @ 5am. It hardly removes any water off the glass Doors and tile shower and it does not come with a hanger. The rubber is very ridged and hardly flexes. I bought a $1.99 Squeegee from Walmart a year ago and it was the best $1.99 I ever spent. Going there tomorrow since I cannot trust these reviews at all anymore.
1,OK so these looked like they might be OK for the price and are made in Washington State (buy local thing).  I was terribly disappointed that a local Washington State company would claim these are waterproof (they know how it rains here).  These boots leaked buckets as the water ran off my waterproof riding suit pant legs right down into the upper part of the boots.  Within minutes of riding the boot was saturated.  The zippers also failed after about a week, the upper stop came off and the zipper just pulled right off in my hands!  Don't expect any support or protection from this boot either, it's front is sort of "armored" but the sides and the rest of the boot is very very thin material. Vega will not deal with any of these issues and say I must go through the dealer I purchased them from... however the dealer says they didn't make the boot or the claim of waterproofing so that's a warranty/advertising issue and to go through Vega. Catch 22 right?  If I ever get this resolved to my satisfaction (return for full refund) I'll post how much effort it took. For now I would avoid VEGA at all costs due to poor products and terrible customer service.
1,States that it's amber/yellow, image shows its dark amber but when received and installed it was a pale yellow. Liked the quality but not the color. I need a dark amber side marker bulb to match my amber LED turn signals.
1,Didn't fit my dodge 2500 cummins but it is a gorgeous hunk of metal fam
1,Seems no mater what I do it don't work right. I live off grid, have years experience with DC voltage connectors but these just don't work well to get full wire rated amps.
1,I've had good experience from other OPT7 products and with this one as well. As others have mentioned, I do wish it was brighter but the product it self including the mounting hardware are great.		P.S. OPT7	I would gladly pay more for a brighter version.		Update.	It seems after using a turn signal sometimes the white drl does not come back on. After doing some research it looks like I'm not the only one with this problem. Guess ill have to try another product.
1,Does not fit my 1996 Ford Explorer XLT 2WD.
1,McGard 24234, listed as Dodge Ram 1500 compatible.  Well, they are 9/16" thread.  Mounted on factory aluminum wheels.  These are WAY longer in length than the stock wheel nuts. They look like sticks protruding from your wheels compared to stock lug nuts, see pictures.  Would not recommend these at all.
1,Junk
1,do not stay in place
1,They are so bad. If I recommended these to anyone I would be a fool. You can't see s*** with these bulbs. All for looks! I'm warning you. Do not buy this s***.....
1,Windows software recognized the scanner but was unable to communicate with it. Tried different software, USB ports even two different laptops but still no luck. There are a lot of similar products sold on Amazon (Wifi, Bluetooth or USB interfaces) and lots of people got the same problem. If you're looking for a USB interface OBD II scanner, go with ScanTool OBDLink SX. It's slightly more expensive (around $30) but it's totally worth it. Better quality cable, nice bundled software plus three years of warranty.
1,THIS STUFF LOOKS AND SMELLS LIKE THE ORIGINAL, BUT DOES NOT GO ON THE SAME AND DOES NOT WORK NEARLY AS WELL. I USED THE ORIGINAL WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT (LATE 70'S) UNTIL IT GOT SOLD OFF TO WHOEVER IS THE OWNER OF THE PRODUCT NOW. IT HAS CHANGED. IF YOU LEAVE ANY WAX ON THE APPLICATOR IT WILL START TO MOLD............ALSO HAD THE PRODUCT WHICH I RESEALED THE CAN AFTER USING, STARTED TO MOLD IN 2 MONTHS. I WOULD SUGGEST THE COMPANY THAT OWNS THIS PRODUCT GET THE FORMULA RIGHT!!!!! i BOUGHT 3 CANS AND THEY ARE NOW ALL IN GARBAGE. NOT BEGGING FOR "SOMEONE" TO MIRACULOUSLY SEND ME A REFUND, JUST WON'T BE GETTING ANY OF MY MONEY ANYMORE. CALLING IT "PREMIUM" WAX IS PRETTY LAME. SUGGEST MOTHERS!!!!!!
1,I have installed many solenoids and isolators and recently tried this one.  I installed this one and after 2 days of use the top of the unit (the small circular disc on the top) blew apart and the plunger popped up and grounded the battery against the housing - this started an electrical fire in my engine compartment, luckily I was able to get the fire out and pull the solenoid plunger out fast enough to prevent further damage.  This product is extremely unsafe and you risk starting a fire in your vehicle, which could lead to a forest fire, house fire or even death.  The problem is that the top of the unit is not crimped or welded on properly, which can cause the solenoid to pop up and fall back down grounding our power source.  I will be letting Amazon know that they are selling a dangerous product.  Of note, I am an experienced mechanic and showed this failure to two other mechanics - none of us have ever seen this happen to a solenoid before.  It is hard to imagine a product could be make with such low quality.
1,NOT wide angled like they advertise. Nor are they bright.
1,Very upset they said these would fit a dodge but they are for a Chevy but sense they where cheap I just wired them to fit the dodge plug. They are a nice blue I have low beams but no hi beams because dodge has hi and lows in one light bulb.
1,I ordered and installed these in my Ford Explorer to replace my originals which still functioned within spec, but I wanted to replace them for preventive maintenance. After the new sensors were installed my check engine light came on and remained on for the two days I drove with them installed. I even I unhooked the battery overnight and the next day the light came on again. I hooked up a Verus scan tool to view the data stream of the sensors and both of them showed that they were not functioning at all. I'm disappointed with this O2 sensor and the factory quality control of them. Thanks to Amazon for refunding my purchase!
1,Didn't pull codes
1,My Chevy van is not 'suoportrd' by the features.
1,Even though I was assured by the manufacturer that they would fit, these mirrors will not fit securely on the 2014 Mercedes-Benz ML mirrors.  Unfortunately, I tried to mount them 6 days after the Amazon Return period had expired; so they could not be returned, and I'm stuck with them.		So, contrary to what the manufacturer will tell you, they will not fit securely on 2014 MB ML mirrors.  The mirrors have too much taper for the straps to hold without slipping off.		If you have a 2014 MB ML, do NOT buy; and if you do, be sure to put them to use before the Amazon Return period expires!
1,Ordered these expecting AGC size fuses, but unfortunately these are NOT AGC size. AGC size is 1 1/4" long by 1/4" diameter. The fuses I received are 30mm long and 5mm in diameter. This is slightly smaller than AGC size in both dimensions, so they did not fit in my fuse holder.		Depending on how your fuses are mounted, 30mm by 5mm MAY work for your specific application, even though they are not true AGC size
1,my father has an old Lisle. but the wheels are shot so i decided to buy one for my self. well its crap ill never buy another one its bending in the middle and the wheels already show tremendous amounts of wear
1,If I could leave 0 stars I would. My package arrived crushe'd the product inside is dented, scratched, and bent. I'm not even sure it's possible to install
1,Looks like i poured glue all over the leather couch, didn't close the cracks.  Too much $, for a crap product that is difficult to use.
1,I thought this light would be a bit blue, but this things are pure white.  Make sure you are aware of this before buying
1,bolt holes did not line up.had to modify to make it work. shipping wasn't the fastest either. pay the extra 20$ and get a better one.
1,I like it but after 3 months its starting to rust out
1,My Trailer box is 316" long and this fit like a glove. I installed it myself on top of the unit. When you open the box you will see a tag that says ( front of cover ) without that the could be a large can of worms. All workmanship is top of the line. What you can't see in this picture is under the flap on the roof is three screened vents to ventilate the roof. I installed this the day before a large snow storm. The wind made the top flutter slightly preventing snow from accumulating. What is very nice is that sides can be unzipped and secured with Velcro straps making it unnecessary to remove cover for maintenance		.UPDATE: 2 1/2 years later ( JUNK ) the top materiel is made from something different the sun ate that up and ripping everywhere. Tearing on rear corners underneath . I would guess that any cover will do this in time. I look at it as renting storage space for my camper in my back yard. Expect to be paying about a $100.00 a year to protect your camper.
1,Do you have any Armour All? Then if you just bought this, you bought it again. I have an 06 Nissan Xterra. Lots of plastic. This just bounced off, just like the other stuff. Very under whelmed. I followed the directions on the bottle. Wiped off any excess, then checked it. You can hardly tell its on there. Just like the other stuff. It even smells the same. If I was the other company, I'd sue them for stealing my useless formula. Going by all the rave reviews, you'd think this was the best thing since sliced bread. I think if your plastic is really bad, and this is the first thing you put on it, then yes, I guess it would look pretty good to you, just like the other stuff. I'll use it, after I use up the "other stuff, since I coat my plastic pretty regular to "try" to keep it lasting longer, but I think we're just kidding our selves with this stuff. It doesn't work well, and it doesn't last! Period!
1,Didn't work for my 1994 c1500. Good shipping time though
1,Save your Money. These are way better http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009W09HG2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00	The kit comes with small ones that are dim. I only used the one for the plates. The rest I used the ones in the link.
1,Sadly, the quality is crap. They fit and function like original but I only got 4 years with minimal driving out of these. Wish cognito or kryptonite would make these. Dorman quality just sucks, OE lasted 13 years go figure.
1,Fits perfect but rides like crap and now my vehicle is inch and a half higher in the front.	The shocks feel like they're too short and when I hit a small bump it feels like it overextended
1,Was impressed by the components they include in the kit... appeared to offer lots of parts for many types of installations.		BUT.... despite its appearance it could not pull hard enough to open a VW Bug hood... seems weird.		AND... now that it is installed.... how do you return.		I'm trying to connect with the manufacturer... but know this issue...
1,These lights are not as bright as the stock Sylvania that I was going to replace them with. Spend a few extra dollars and buy PIAA 9006 bulbs.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PIAA-10926-9006-HB4-Intense-White-9006-51W-115W-Xtra-Intense-White-Bulb-Twin-Pack/dp/B000MG630I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PIAA 10926 9006 (HB4) Intense White - 9006 51W=115W Xtra Intense White Bulb, Twin Pack</a>&nbsp;They are very bright and will last a long time. They are the best!
1,Ok...I'm giving this kit 2 stars because I got it to fit on my 2006 Hinda Pilot EX-L. I would say the instructions are super poor and you do have to kinda rig it to fit. And even while I rigged it, it doesn't sit flush like I would like. See pics.		Heres how I figured out how to install it..	1. Place the trim on the double din radio and snap on the side pieces. It will take a little bit of patience but try to keep steady.	2. Find the best holes to use to screw in the plastic mounts to the side. It shoukd be pretty obvious and in the end, the front trim should still be pretty flushed to your radio.	3.now slide the radio into the dashboard and line up the holes.	4. Screw in the top screws just til u feel a little resistance.  Do not tighten (I used loctite on these top two screws because they will be left loose..but u may not have to)	5. Now screw  in the two bottom ones and tighten normally.	6. Now install the factory front facia in its place WHILE you press downwards on the bottom lip of your double din radio...just below the screen. What you are trying to do is wedge the factory trim over the metra trim because it is a tight fit. That's why you left the top 2 screws a little loose...but snug.		That's it. I kinda like how it isn't flushed because it points the radio parralel to the ground.....		Hope this helps
1,Bulbs were somewhat brighter than stock. They only last a year and a half on normal use to and from work.
1,Good size but I took a gamble to see if they would work on a klr 650.........it does not. The bags are hitting your knees and hang at a very funny angle
1,Well it was bright but only worked for 3 months . I would not recomend it . Now the so called warranty is over & I'm stuck with it .
1,did not fit great,odd vision looking through. it blew off my helmet on the highway
1,I replaced my factory antenna with one of these because I was scraping the ceilings in parking garages in my lifted F-150. I probably won't be scraping anymore but my radio reception has suffered a bit. This is problematic because I live in LA, where it's flat as a pancake, radio waves are unobstructed and the only radio station I listen to is literally located 20 miles away. If I'm having issues getting a clear broadcast under these conditions, I'm not looking forward to listening to the radio on a road trip.
1,This is an example of getting what you paid for.  Mine arrived missing a pop rivet.  So, I had to repair it in order to use it.  Since, I only intend to use it on my single cylinder motorcycle, it only has to work just once and I'll get by.  If your looking for a nice piston ring compressor for your garage, perhaps you should look at others.		I see folks using inexpensive ring compressors for an engine rebuild and wonder why when there are tapered ring compressors that match their cylinder bore.  Pop ... done ... repeat.  This ring compressor is a step up from using your fingers and if your careful using it then it should get the job done.
1,So I've had these on for a month or more before I'm writing this review. Installation was fine and we let them sit for 48 hrs with the Windows up. Now that being said, the front windows still hit the plastic near the front of the window. My husband even trimmed some of the plastic down and they still hit. Would I buy them again after having the in channel? No. They also greatly increased wind noise which is disappointing. So overall, they keep the water out when it's raining, but they rub and are noisy. I guess the decision is yours...i would try another brand and ones that sit on the outside of the door.
1,Doesn't translate all the Dodge codes, but will read and clear the,.
1,Have these as back up lights under my bumper work great... Puts good light....Mounting sucks (using nylon nuts when you can't put a wrench in it,  had to use flathead to hold nut) and also water condensation was built up in about 3 days... No issues but it's there		Update! Half of one of the lights failed...tried to contact mfg but no dice....what can you expect for the price....i would give one but they worked great when they worked
1,Needs to have brighter illumination, Worked great at first. Now it will only work 80% of the time. The buttons don't always work. No longer clears codes. It needs to be improved upon before I can recommend this version. I would pay more for a different unit that worked better/reliably and had a more readable display. This reminds me of 80s technology.
1,the manufactures of this otherwise nice product decided to cut corners with something as small and simple as the freaking rivets.  In other words, A moron within the company decided to scrimp on something so small and simple as a rivet that becomes rusty after the very first rain storm.  Are you all kidding me?  This  moron  with no common sense has a nice job while my ass sits at home with my felony.  What is wrong with people???  BTW, would you like your rusty product back?  I don't need crap like that...You get what you pay for ...Fill-Right rivets haven't shown any signs of corrosion anywhere.  Yes, 30 bucks more, but it's worth not taking your business to the cost over conscious armatures.
1,broke after two months
1,After taking the time to install which is a real pain. It leaked 2 hours later and left me stranded. This part actually is ending up to be very expensive after a tow!
1,Maybe I don't know how to use this, but it doesn't fit any standard sized wet sand papers, and I found it hard to use.
1,They light up great. Batteries wear out fast. Worst problem is that they are NOT WATERPROOF. So these are fine for bicycles but NOT FOR CARS.		THERE ARE OTHER LIGHTS SOLD THAT ARE WATERPROOF AND SOLAR CHARGED
1,Does not fit Subaru correctly, they fell off when ice got into the connection area and I had to cut the stupid bracket which looked like it wasn't correct after I installed them anyway. I had tie wrap it on to get home in the storm. They should have given the pins which I took from my old Anco set but they still aren't worth the money! The attachment bracket is not correct for this vehicle. I will be contacting Trico.
1,Maybe would fit if you have a massive watermelon for a head
1,Does not fit a 2017 Lincoln MKC
1,Broke immediately. Not even worth the couple of bucks I paid for it. Seller, stop selling this.
1,After a couple months of use I've noticed that half the bulb has "burned" off the blue tinting. Still works but don't expect the bulb to provide a bright white light. At best is marginally better than stock. If stock was 3000k I'd rate these 3800k new and 3500k current
1,When I first tried this I thought it was awesome.  It started my 4 yr old Stihl chainsaw that had been in storage for 3 yrs.  I tried it, with success, in my Echo trimmer and edged as well.  I'll never mix fuel again, or so I thought.  Then after felling a tree my chainsaw wouldn't start.  So I went out and bought a new smaller Echo chainsaw for limbing. I put the fuel in then after 30 min of pulling I gave up and returned it, defective.  Bought another Echo, same everything, and spent another 30 min trying to start it.  Back to Home Depot, 2 defective saws it's not possible, I said. I took off the plug before I returned the 2nd Echo and it was fouled with a black soot.  I'd write it off to improper combustion if it actually started.  Then off to Lowes, Husqvarna it is.  Fueled it up and another 30min., nothing.  Ok my original saw and 3 brand new saws and none will start?  I just bought the TruFuel from HD online 3 days ago, 6 PK.  So I drained out the Trufuel from my Stihl and my new Husqvarna and put in fuel I mixed up with 2 cycle oil and Sta-bil and after 10 min. I had them both starting and running. I seems to work in the line trimmer and edger but it's staying out of my chainsaws.
1,Doesn't work as good as another well known brand. Never gives the same info twice for the same destination. Also just stops working for no reason, requiring you to start over  again.
1,Well the one on the outside didn't make it on the first ride i was on the freeway and went to shift and it was gone, i put loctite on them and torqued it down as much as it would take with it being aluminum that really sucks.
1,Junk
1,This product is well built and worked flawlessly on my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Less than half the cost of the Mopar product. Replacement boots are also available so you don't have to buy an entire new coil if one of them becomes worn or damaged.		Update!		Spoke too soon! I am six months into this item and it failed on me. Jeep started running on only four cylinders, check engine light flashed multiple misfire codes. Lucky for me I was only a few miles from where I keep my parts vehicle and was able to swap it out. If I was any further away I would have had to call a wrecker. I guess when it comes to electrical products, its worth paying extra for the factory item. The original part lasted 12 years and 190,000 miles. This one lasted 6 months and only 2500 miles, since the car was off the road for a couple months having the engine replaced. Thank you Amazon for coming through for me and sending me a return shipping sticker and refunding the purchase price.
1,On multiple bikes even with the rubber piece it won't hold the throttle above 40mph.. I figured this would be good for highway crusing, but on my smooth vtwin it won't hold solid even.
1,Switch is good, instructions suck.  READ them don't follow the diagram as it is WRONG!!!  Following the diagram for the 3 wire hookup will result in a shorted LED backlight.
1,Junk has some value, this cable doesn't have any value..	Three day after installing this cable it was completely frozen
1,sent back
1,Cheap Chinese junk. Defective out of the box. Believe the negative reviews. 16% of the reviews are 1 star for the same issue of leaking vacuum. Doesn't say much for Dorman quality with such a high defect rate.  Buy the OEM part and save yourself the hassle of returning it and than having to buy the OEM part. I would be very  concerned on the product life of this valve even if it did hold vacuum since a failure to control vacuum will cause you vacuum pump to run constantly and shorten its life.
1,We have a very new Winnebago 5th wheel trailer.  An extremely nice RV.  However, it came equipped with Trail Express tires.  I always inspect my tires and check pressure--ran at max 65 psi on 225/75-15 tires.  Why would Winnebago put these cheap Chinese made tires on an expensive trailer?  At less than 1000 miles, one exploded.  It tore-out the side of the trailer.  Thousands of dollars in damage to the wheels and trailer.  When I get it back from the dealership (currently under repair), I will tow it far enough to have four Maxxis tires placed on the unit.  I won't even resell these virtually new take-offs, as I do not want this to happen to someone else.
1,Product was broken and had to send it back.  This is a fragle product and although it looked OK at first glance, I had to take the bulb off to remove the shipping material. This is when I noticed it was broken inside.  I sent it back and a new one came packaged the same way. This one works fine.  I unpacked it and it wasn't broken.
1,As stated already, this is a hard plastic piece of plastic. Unfortunately, the brass staples used to seal the box scratched the top and bottom of the grille. So if you don't plan on prep work, sanding, cleaning, priming, and painting, then beware, this probably isn't what you're looking for. I've spent the last three hours doing just that. The gouges were particularly deep in the bottom. I'm in the process of painting, and the second coat is about to go on. My work is the only thing that saved it. I dropped one star for shipping damage caused by the packer, I've dropped one star because it was oily and dusty out of the package, and one star for the rigidity of the plastic.
1,I had a slight oil leak, after 1,000 miles it's still leaking exactly the same
1,Stopped working,money down the drain.
1,Cap fits but interior design wrong causing air leakage. Useless!
1,I purchased multiple of these ballasts.  I would not purchase them again. They usually only last about 2-4 days then need to be replaced. I would NOT recommend these nor purchase again
1,Poorly made. Cotton stitching on a heat shield product? Can't imagine a project requiring heat shield for which this would be adequate.
1,installed in a 2011 ford fusion. could not get it to pair with my motorola droid turbo 2, let alone sync up with all three of the apps the product recommends you use.		it was cheap enough that it isn't a terribly big deal for me...it will be useful to someone i know eventually, i'm sure.
1,I don't see anything more / or better than with my existing mirrors
1,Bought a set of these two summers ago 2015. Worked great. It is now December 2016 and I have to replace the driver side. Bright still works not the cruising light. Burnt out. Can not buy just one to replace the bad. Not a good deal.
1,The gloss finish of this vinyl give this a more realistic look than some of the matte films I've seen. From a far distance it looks good... until you get close enough to actually see it. That is about it for the positive points.		This vinyl is THICK and quite a bit harder to stretch over curved surfaces than films I've tried in the past. After wasting a good 25% of what I ordered trying to get this stuff installed halfway decent, I finally broke out an industrial strength Milwaukee heat gun and had some success wit curves. The trick seems to be heating this film just a wee bit shy of its actual melting point for the curved parts. I covered some of the wood trim in my Volvo's interior. I wasn't super pleased with it, but it looked good enough for the untrained eye & I called it "good enough".		To my great disappointment, the edges of the film had all lifted in less than 48 hours and now my XC90 looks like garbage. It looks like I tried to cover things with cheap contact paper or something. It all has to be taken apart again & removed ASAP
1,Fuel rail wrap was missing a hole in the middle of the rail between number 3 and 4 injectors for a vent cap.  Installed on a 2004 Grand Cherokee 4.0.  The injector sleeves didn't fit very tight on the injectors.  And the fiberglass insert that goes on top of the intake manifold didn't fit in the screw mounts at all.  A better idea for heat reduction would be to get or make ceramic coated headers to reduce engine bay heat.
1,I just use it one month right now not working low quality.
1,Many of the other reviewers are okay with the lack of visibility due to it being a thicker piece of film. However, if you plan on seeing anything outside the window clearly and be able to read signs and make out distinct objects, then you should not purchase this window tint.		I had put the film on the driver side window around 2pm in the shade. It was a clear day. After I finished putting the film on. I could hardly see or make out addresses in the neighborhood because the film was so blurry. I don't want to imagine how it would fare during the evening. A very big safety issue.		Other thoughts: It being thicker than average tint, the film was very hard to shape and cut.
1,I did not buy this from Amazon. I purchased it from a RV store.	It leaks. Good thing i tested it day before I really need it to use it. Luckily i had silicon with me, in my tool box. With silicon I left it on from 3PM to 10am & it worked fine. Now i am looking for a cap for it, because I like to leave it on permanently.
1,Put these on less than a year ago (July 2017) The passenger side has failed..... I would guess less than 10,000 miles on it.  Bucking up and getting the Timken this time.
1,The springs break to easy...  Like they really break off... Mechanic doesnt want me to buy this again...
1,Broke upon installation
1,This down not fit 2011 Honda Civic Low Beam Head Light.
1,Looks used and dirty.  I tried using it and its worse than a paint brush from home depot.  Spend the extra few dollars and get a better product!
1,The box read JK 713,5 but the item was completely different than what's picture. The bends were 45 degree angles rather than the 90 degree bend show in the picture. Looked as if someone had swiped them with REDROCK's Taillight version. I've sent back for an exact exchange to see if the pictures are actually wrong or if I've been swindled. I'll update this review when I get the new set.
1,Absolute junk. If you like your mirrors to continually move while you ride, and loosen when you try to reposition , then by all means buy these massive pieces of excrement
1,I've bought two driver's side wiper replacements from Valeo and both streak a bit right out of the box.  One was really bad, the other was just a bit noticeable.  Slightly disappointing but the fit is good and they don't make any noise.  I'll probably try them one more time before I go to another brand.		Update - The second Valeo I purchased continued to get worse so I've downgraded this rating to one star.  I've switched to the Bosch Icons and so far so good.  But their reviews say that they streak too soon also so we'll see...
1,Did not work for me!  The hole in lock was too small and would not go over the u-bolt.  Had to drill it out to size.  Once lock was installed (as per instructions) I could turn the entire lock assembly (a little hard but), and at same time, loosening the lug nut and  thereby able to remove the tire.		My fix was to install 2 thin lug nuts (grounded down to fit inside the lock assy.) and jam them together, preventing them from turning when the lock was turned.  I carry a pliers and a crescent wrench to loosen the jammed lugs for removal.		This way, when the lock is installed, you can turn the lock assembly all you want, but never able to loosen the nuts.		Should have sent me a larger lock for the u-bolt you sent; and maybe one with a swivel washer of some sort.  Then again, maybe there's something I don't know.
1,Sprayer doesn't work. Can't rate the actual product if I can't apply it.
1,They probably work fine, but are NOT surface mount due to where the wires come out of the assembly.  They wouldn't work for my application so I returned them.
1,did not work well started flickering after install
1,Plastic not metal like it says do not buy
1,Doesn't work properly for Toyota Avalon 2004. If you use it you can't use the OEM Coil Spring insulator and the Spring will creak.		Instead search a toyota site for the OEM part for the "Upper Insulator" in the Front Suspension section.
1,I expected SS parts to put on my show truck. On closer inspection, I noticed the letters were NOT magnetic and the way the letters were cut left imperfections that I could not repair. I decided I didn't want to put the these letters on my truck. I sent the letters back.
1,Shape of the bulb area is different, does not fit in turn signal assembly of my Harley. Almost damaged housing assembly when removing it. Poor engeneering. Returning.
1,About the only truthful information about this product is that it seems to be a glass lens and it's 3-3/4" diameter. The frame is BLACK PLASTIC, made in Taiwan (what isn't) and the reflected image is distorted. Of course, I can still see objects clearly in the mirror. It's just REAL maddening that people put false descriptions on Amazon to sell products. This was to be installed on my classic restored car, so it's important that the mirrors match/cover my chrome outside rear view mirrors that are flat (can't see anything behind me unless adjusted exactly correct.
1,Tried it, didn't seem to make a difference.  Won't buy again.
1,These needed to be replaced after only 6 months due to streaking, seemed to be pressing the wiper at uneven points almost from the beginning on a G37.  Also did not like how they looked at rest from driver's view (the way the backside of the wiper looks, not a smooth clean look).  Went back to OEM and much happier.  Have also used BOSCH ICON in the past, they may look similar but BOSCH perform much better.
1,This is one of the nicest looking extensions I have bought. However, the side steel springs on each side of the plug are too weak to hold the plug in the socket. Any vibrations or the touching of the cord would cause the plug to disconnect. Tried 3, 12 volt sockets. All had the same problem with this plug. I did speak with a reprsentative from Tire Tech and he offered to refund my money. Very nice people at Tire Tech. They are trying to produce a good product.		Amazon was more than helpful, as usual. Ordered another 12 volt car cigarette lighter extension from Amazon and it is working great.
1,Terrible
1,It didn't fit my 2006 BMW 325i.  There are a couple of problems.  The pin on the wiper arm only fits about 1/2 way through a hole in the blade.  I might have kept it if that was the only problem, because the blade swiveled okay on the wiper arm.  The bigger problem is that a BMW housing, that fits on top of where the wiper arm pin fits through the blade hole cannot be seated on top of the wiper blade.  The blade has all this adapter plastic on top of it that prevents the housing from seating completely.  It *almost* seats, but is forced up about 3/16" by a protrusion from this adapter plastic.		Since I was unable to install the blade I can't comment on how good the blade is for cars that can use it.  I'd like to know who determined that "It fits your 2006 BMW 325i".  I suppose it was the manufacturer, that's why I'm giving it one star.
1,Only half of the lights work, the other half do not.  Not to upset, cheap bulbs in bulk.  It is hit or miss.
1,It's pretty crapy. The tongue is way too short (not enough metal past the pin hole) and two of the support arms are welded on very crooked, causing the deck to twist and torque when assembled.
1,Is well made but it does not have tabs on the back to hold the bottom of the license plate in the frame as many other frames do.  They should supply custom bolts for the bottom since there aren't any tabs to hold the plate.
1,I went ahead and ordered this IR thermometer because of all the great reviews on it... I've see an IR thermometer work before and it's awesome, so I decided to get this little one, since it's so versatile.  the box even states for use as a medical device since it doesn't have the laser.... well, either the thermometer is way off, or i'm real sick.  the temp reading against the skin (or arm pit, mouth, chest, under shirt, leg, ear, head) varies from 90 to 97...	(the mouth is consistent at 97)	my house AC is set at 77, but all the readings are 75.5. at least in that aspect it's consistent... but when I opened the box and expected to see 96.2 for my body temp or something around there... I wasn't to happy to see the numbers being way off.		Therefore I must the party pooper for giving this product a 1 star rating because there's no point to having this if it's not going to be accurate.		I'll work with Amazon in getting the item returned or exchanged with another one.
1,Was told by Amazon this would work to put in our new pioneer radio in our Ford F250. It did not work. We ended up spending over an hour trying to figure out how to make it work because we were told it was suppose to and the directions were hard to understand. We ended up having to go to the auto store and buying a different one that worked perfectly.
1,Does not stick on surfice that well-tends to peel when hot out> Save Your Money Folks.
1,These lights don't illuminate as foglights should. There all over, just testing them by turning you low beams off then leaving these foglights on, there not bright. They match my F-150 2016 headlights don't get me wrong but the lighting as foglights hmm nah. I'm very disappointed, maybe that's  what I should  do is invent  something that somewhat works charge an amount and live the good life. However I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. Very poor product
1,Purchased these sway bar links for my 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan 3.8l on January 8th 2018. At first all was good, then started getting clunking noises again after I already replaced the front struts that didn't last very long either.		Today on February 27th 2018, I went and bought at a local Irish Auto parts store. This was a $20 part and the quality is better than the AC Delco. Thicker and stronger. I replaced the drivers side. I will do the passenger side tomorrow for preventive maintenance.		Giving two stars since the passenger side seems ok.
1,Two of the stepper motors were bad upon arrival. Quite a pain to do all the work to install, and have to undo then redo it to remedy low quality motors.
1,It was nice not having an antenna scraping across the garage door when going in and out, but it drops reception more than I find acceptable.  It also whistles when driving down the highway and drove me nuts.  Unfortunately, I kept it too long to return.  Fortunately, I kept the original.  This is going in the trash.
1,Seem to be good quality upon Installation but after using for one day they drive me crazy. They slide all over while getting in & out & the back mat gets hung up under my driver seat & is starting to tear.
1,These do not fit a 2012 Chevy Silverado Truck!
1,[UPDATE] While driving the blade part of this wiper flew off the clip that attaches to the wiper arm.  NOTE this does not mean the attachment mechanism failed, it means the wiper blade assembly flew apart while I was driving!!  This is seriously unsafe.  This pair of wipers was just more than one year old.		[Original review]		I've been a fan of Rain-x wipers since they first came out maybe 4-5 years ago, and have now bought several sets from Amazon. I am pleased at how the pricing has gotten more competitive (my first set I bought with introductory rebate BOGO offer, and tried not to pay more than that for a pair since). About 1-2 years ago the sizing changed, and the last set I ordered flashed up on amazon "not the right size for your car" Ignoring the warning I bought the same size I had ordered 3 years ago, and when they came they were definitely SHORT by about 1". I kept them because they still covered all the main viewing sections of the windshields. Overall performance is pretty good in both rain and snow. They don't crust up with ice too much because of the design. Maybe a little bit more than traditional winter wipers, but not enough so to be a problem. Generally they wipe quite streak free, and I'll continue buying them in the future, making sure to pay attention to the amazon sizing recommendations. They seem pretty durable from UV perspective also, though to be sure I haven't tested them in desert conditions.
1,the gauge stopped being accurate after a few months. it is literally 10+lbs off.  if it reads 27lbs, there is really 42lbs of pressure in the tire. so don't expect it to last for anything more than filling tires, the gauge will fail.
1,Returned for better product
1,I've installed one side today. I stripped the stud on the upper and can't get the flush mount grease fitting to take grease. So aggravated right at this point. I just ordered a new set of Synergy's. Everybody on the jeep forums are recommending them. Wished I'd have done a little more research before spending the money in the first place.		Shipping was quick and great though...
1,Doesn't fit 1157 like stated.
1,Stress points on the handles are sewn, not continuous webbing. Installed almost exactly 3 months ago. Catastrophic failure. Put my lady on her ass in the dirt. Poor quality at best. Dangerous at worst. Try something else.
1,After 2 years pure garbage pushes hard. strap broke right away. metal on strap straightened out first use. Sits in the way. Just takes up space. Foam on pegs lasted a few uses. Just a waste of money and we didn't even get much snow the last 2 years.
1,Charger arrived in perfect condition, but is defective.  Attached tender to 1 month old battery which had a Battery Tender Jr. attached and was holding it's voltage at 13.35v.  Attached this unit and it took it to 14.6v for an hour before I detached it.  I waited a few minutes and reatached it and it did the same thing again.  The battery was boiling from the voltage being so high for an hour each time I attached this unit.  Cheap junk made in China.  Lucklly Amazon is awesome and is replacing the unit.  I hope the next one works or I will just go back to my individual Tenders.  I wish Battery Tender had better quality control... don't they test these units before shippping?  I guess not.  Hope my 1 month old battery is still OK.
1,Did not work for my 06 RAM 1500. my truck has canbus system therefor i would get flickering or no light output at all and decided to buy these to prevent that problem but they didn't work. I just ended up doing a relay harness.
1,so bad, I can use them.
1,Not genuine leather, but actually synthetic. Looks like leather on the outside. The inside is not the suede-like finish you would see with actual leather. No leather scent either. The "leather" is a kind of foam material. Returned.
1,For over a hundred bucks for a very simple piece of plastic and metal, it could at LEAST be packaged well. I ordered two, both were damaged badly enough it affected the function. They sent replacements, both came with bent frames, the same poor packaging, and one had a giant boot print on it. No wonder it was broken. I sliced my hand open close to needed stitches and bled all over my equipment. ALL of  the metal in the package is	stamp-cut so it's basically a box of razor blades. This is where a little warning sticker would be appropriate.
1,Like . I do like it but now, I just saw that one of my new lights has water in it, we had a lot of rain, and nowOne has water in the lens
1,I purchased this to remove leftover adhesive from the side of a vehicle after removing some molding -- and it literally did nothing whatsoever. It was tantamount to using water. I tried it also on that stiff black foam stuff that's used to mount nameplates/vehicle badges--same thing.		I literally don't know what this is good for. Goo gone walks all over this product and I've never heard anyone really recommend thatfor really tough jobs (as a 3M product would imply).		Their adhesive removal drill wheel works great (which I bought in conjunction with this product) but this was a total waste of $10 for me. I actually threw the can away 7/8 full as I couldn't imagine it actually working on anything.
1,Did not fit my doors
1,Thanks to amazon and my prime membership or this would have been a really bad purchase.  Out of the 10 lights only 7 worked out of the gate.  I only needed 5 but I paid for 10.  Amazon didn't want them back and refunded the purchase price. I kept the 5 running in my dash for almost 6 months now and two of those 5 are flickering. Not looking forward to the hour break down of my dash to replace but when I do Im not going cheap again.
1,I had this winch a while until I finally got the chance to change the old one out.  Well, this is a POS.  If I could return it, I would.  Low quality, and poor materials used.  Don't waste you money like I did on this winch.  OK, to be fair, I did take the cable off to keep as a spare for the SuperWinch I ordered... So I did get something I can use.
1,Sharp edges, poor quality finish.
1,Super cheap product. It almost felt like it was going to fall apart in my hands. The screws provided are cheap and the coating of the paint scarcely covers the "steel". It's about as thick as a soda can and scratches very easily. I would not recommend this product for the price listed.
1,DID NOT STICK GOOD ON VEHICLE.....STUCK MORE ON THE PAPER ;(
1,Looks cool, but can't work  - since it is too small to fit original hole... waste of money, since it rattles around in opening... specs would have been nice to compare to orig unit beforehand!!!
1,On June 27,2013 I ordered the set of 6 new Ignition Coils. I installed them when they arrived and my 2002 GMC Envoy ran great and smooth and the MPG increased by 2MPG. In Sept. of 2013 I had an engine code of #1 misfire, I replaced the coil with one of the old ones and again it ran great. In Nov.of 2013 I had an engine code of #2 misfire, again I replaced the coil with one of the old ones and again it ran great. Jan. of 2014 I had a code of #4 misfire, again replaced the new coil with an old one and it ran great again. My original coils lasted over 11 years, and are again in service on 3 of the 6 cylinders. The coils are advertised as GM parts, but clearly they are not OEM parts. In less than a year I have replaced 3 of the 6 new coils I purchased, be warned you get what you pay for. If you have to pay someone to install the coils, they can be very costly if you are not a DIY person.
1,Works within 5-10 feet nothing near the original
1,I purchased two of these lights and installed them on my truck as auxiliary back up lights.  Three weeks after they were installed I noticed a crack in one of the lenses.  I contacted the company, who, after telling me that they were sending me a replacement, and then two more emails, they have sent out a replacement.  Now, two weeks after the email telling me they have shipped it, it is still sitting in China according to the tracking info.  This issue has taken more than a month so far, and still no resolution.  Next time I will go to my local NAPA to buy the light!
1,Numerous failures
1,The thread on the ball joint stripped while installing and now I have to cut it off and replace with a higher quality product.  Not too much more to say.
1,Returned did not fit as advertised for Mercedes E 500..
1,The starter itself is not bad, the problem I had was the warranty. After two months of using, the key chain plastic starter broke off from the ring. I called the  warranty department and I was told that this is not covered ( the warranty  stated "All parts have two year warranty against defects in workmanship") Representative told me that I can send the unit for replacement plus $30.00 Two months later the same happened to my wife's unit (I bought two starters)  and again the warranty was declined. It's only a plastic cover that needs to be replaced and they made such a big deal about it. I will stay away from this brand.
1,these are OK, but they are cheap and quality is poor.  I dropped one of the hammers and the head broke off, not the handle, but the iron head !  The set I received looked as though they had already been used.  Even the case was shattered when it arrived.  Think next time I would look for a better quality set of body hammers.
1,The cover is nice. The stitching on the outside around the edges is a total disgrace. Less than 3 years its all off. I don't reco it.
1,Installation is easy enough. Directions are clear. The element is garbage.		After completing the installation, it pligged it in to the available 120V/20A GFCI where my RV is parked. It immediatelty tripped it. Using my meter, I isolated the issue to the element. I used an adapter to plug into the 120V/30A. It made 1 tank of water, and the element completely failed.		I've bought countless items with the Camco name on them. I'm very surprised they have such poor QC on this particular product.
1,Apparently the spring inside heated up too much and compressed causing the plug to develop a bad connection that caused more heat even to the point of discoloring the metal parts and left burn marks on the internal fuse. The fuse never blew.
1,You get what you pay for. One of the fittings is not machined out so it's worthless and the mounting bracket is junk. But it was 20 bucks. Probably won't use.
1,Don't let the bottle get at all low. The turbine oil is great. The 2-star review is for having to clean up half a bottle of oil from the bottom of my tool box again. Don't get me wrong, the oil is a super product that I use constantly in A/C and appliance repairs, but the mess it can make gets really old.		As the weather changes and barometric highs and lows pass through, the pressure change from high to low pushes the oil up the zoom spout if the cap is worn, loose, or missing. Oil fountains everywhere. As long as there is little air over the oil, the problem doesn't seem happen, so keep your bottle full.
1,Don't waste your money on this product. Try AUTOZONE or ADVANCE AUTO at buying a better pump than on AMAZON.
1,I installed one of these LEDs to replace a blown LED side light in Porsche Cayenne.  The bulb illuminates and is bright white, however it triggers a warning message to check side light.  While these bulbs are very low cost, and I'd recommend them for a standard application, these don't appear to be suitable for an error-free application requiring a CANBUS built-in load resistor.
1,At first I thought they sent brackets for a TJ but they don't even come close to installing on my buddies TJ not to mention my '17 JK. The holes do not line up to the mounting holes on the JK windshield frame. Not really sure what i can do with these at this point. I won't drill new holes into the brackets because that will look like crap.  Maybe use a plastic dead hammer on them to open the angle of the brackets?		Follow up: I ended up cutting the bottom portion of the bracket off. So, now they are only being held by the upper 2 bolts. I drove approximately 100 miles on the highway and seems to be holding fine with my 52" LED bar light just as they are.
1,This is a cheap product. I gave it a shot, but it does not even come close to the real ones. It will not scratch your car but it's not soft and also very difficult to work with. Can you do the job? Yes you can, but it's not easy to work with.
1,Broke
1,After a year it started squealing.  After 1/2 second it changes its original low tone to an extremely high pitch sound which is embarrassing.  Factory lasted 8 years and I got 1 out of this upgraded version.
1,some come out
1,Bought three of these for use when setting up vehicle to be towed behind RVs. One didn't work out of the box and the other two burned out within a few weeks of use. Not recommended at all. I now have switched to using water-proof 40-amp relays.
1,Sad good price, unable to ship to California
1,1/2 LEDs out in less than a year 8mo
1,Out of the box 5 of the lights did not work!
1,Chinamans garbage
1,its Blue color, no white.
1,Had them in about two weeks and one stopped working.  Found both were melted.
1,what are high performance ignition coils ?  If you own a  Ford, use motorcraft ignition coils.
1,Useless for our Venza. They slide right through the opening to the floor and become upreachable and useless
1,Lasted 2 weeks past the 30day return before it stopped working, definitely avoid this product
1,Cheap construction.  Vibrates while driving.  If you try to tighten the mirror the cheap pot metal bolt breaks.  Yes, the bolt is made of pot metal. Mirror surface is wavy.  A far cry from factory quality.
1,Bought my size. Needed 2 sizes up. The company wouldn't exchange. Useless.
1,did not work for removing decals off my trailer -- it just seemed to ball them up and smear the glue all over
1,garbage. Where the throttle body connect to the sensor that is shown above has a plastic ring that connect to the throttle body, it WILL BREAK!! I sent it back to amazon. This is not a good fit part. You will have High RPM and Horrible acceleration. don't buy this one, you will see at the bottom of the pic, that the plastic caved in to the sensor. Which will make it ineffective. Buy OEM or Duralast not this one, if you look at the bottom of the pic, you will see what it looks like after 5 starts. the center connection will break against the throttle body.
1,When it arrived, I tested it to see if was air tight.  I placed a finger over the bottom hole and one of the top ports while blowing on the other top port and I could feel air blowing into my face from the top fitting for the sight tube.  This would be seen as a vacuum leak by the engine computer.  I sent mine due to the air leak.  I'm somewhat pleased about having a defective product sent to me because I've read up more on these catch cans since my initial purchase and it appears that non-baffled cans do not catch nearly as much oil as baffled cans, so I'm going to buy a can that has a baffle as a replacement for the defective unit I received.
1,first time i rode in the rain it shorted out
1,Blew apart within 2 days very poor design, don't waste your time with this product
1,-Poorly manufactured.	-Fog up real quick and stay foggged.	-Pretty flimsy.	-Comparable to gas station glasses.
1,Worked for long enough to be out of amazon warranty. Wells fuel pumps are legendarily poor quality, but thought this might be better. I was wrong. No interior lights, no door chime. Only installed for 3 months.
1,I had a steering wheel puller set (Lisle 45000), but needed a pair of puller legs for removing a steering wheel without threaded holes.  I bought this set to get them, because this set was cheaper than getting the puller legs by themselves.  Those work very well, but one of the threaded bolts bent as I attempted to remove a steering wheel on a different vehicle. Update (4/17/15): one of the puller legs broke when attempting to remove a steering whee that didn't have threaded holesl. This was only the second time I used the puller legs! This would have been a one-star review if it had cost me more.
1,This stuff appears to do absolutely nothing beyond making a mess. I've sprayed it MANY times on a water pump gasket on my Land Rover (and let it sit) and it's done absolutely nothing.... just  made a big mess. VERY disappointed and feel like my money was completely wasted. :(
1,Looks great but lousy reception. I live in the country and the old antenna	worked better so I reintalled it. Also a note on the AntennaX package said to	remove before going thru a car wash.		I now have agreat tool to stir my paint.
1,Very flimsy, several links broke while extending the sewer hose holder but I was able to use it, hence the two stars vs. one. I would not however purchase that product again.
1,Dead on arrival. It did not work for me at all. I changed the batteries and still DOA. I would not recommend this product. Maybe I got a bad one.
1,Nice upgrade installed along with led bulbs and is much brighter than stock plain lights.
1,Did my steering wheel. I've worked with much cheaper vinyl before and had a better experience. Even with a heat gun this stuff does not want to flex around a trim piece. The adhesive just won't hold it. Peels back very easily. Unsticks itself from behind trim and creates bad edges. Does not look as real in person as it does in pictures.
1,Look cheap.  Would not put them on my bike.
1,Caution.  IT DOES NOT WORK WITH AN IPHONE.  I used it with my Note 3 okay but when I went back to the new iPhone it will not pair.  In Amazon search I put OBD IOS iPhone and this device come up but IT DOES NOT WORK WITH AN IPHONE.!!!
1,Will clear coat work for scratches on the 'tan' top? I thought I would get the same color as hard top but I still can't seem to find it. The clear coat came instead.		I really would like to get the hard top looking nice again. Thank you.
1,All I can do to give it 1star, so disappointed on the condition it showed up in, even in that impressive tube. Paper coming off, deep wrinkles, doomed from the start. Good thing it was wet application, was easier to pull back off and trash can it.
1,i expected the cover to be thicker and more cushioned. Seems not very substantial...and also was too large to fit a MG-TD correctly.
1,Junk
1,NICE LOOKING PIECE DELIVERED AS PROMISED,BUT DOES NOT FIT MOTOR GEAR TOOTH COUNT.THEY WANT $7.42 SHIPPING TO RETURN A PART THAT DOES NOT FIT.
1,I really don't like the way they feel and fit. Other posible comments on the way they look and not very good about how they feel. It doesn't feel right and the elastics on it don't match the style. Really not what I was expecting. I rather stick to my old ones.
1,I've had this installed since June 2, 2017, and today Sept. 9, 2017 it blew apart, and I lost all my power steering fluid while I was driving.  I was able to get to someplace safe where I could pull this thing out and replace it with a 3/8" dual hose barb.  It was installed properly, with the correct amount of fluid.  Apparently the retaining ring isn't mean to last for the long run.		The one I installed was the supposed "new" version and it still failed.		I would never install this product again.
1,Failed in less than a year, buy an OEM one. This is not a job you will want to do more than once.		Installation on a 2005 Dodge Durango 4.7L was a massive pain, but not because of the part itself. The valve came with all the necessary gaskets and hardware. No more CEL, no issues.
1,Pure Junk !!!!  Makes very nice streaks on your glass.  Poor quality covers, like toilet paper.
1,I purchased these to protect the undercarriage of my car when using my HF jack stands.  Dimensions seemed large enough to fit the stands and I thought they would work well enough.  Wrong.  A deeper belly in the heads on my stands caused these covers to cup badly and the thin covering did little to eliminate the marking that the teeth of the jack stand left behind.
1,Wish I had not indulged in this product.  I thought it would help keep the garbage bag manageable outside our RV.  I had liked the idea of the lid.  But I didn't think it through enough I guess:	--The size is totally wrong for normal 13 gallon bags.  If you want one that fits correctly and does not slide off the rim, you need to special order a smaller size; 13 gal. is too large.	--It is very light weight:  Wind knocks it over.	--It does not have a base, just a bottom rim:  So if you have a lot in the bag, it bulges out the sides and falls off the top rim.  When it bulges out, it is hard to remove the bag for disposal.	--Dummy me:  I looked at the lid and considered it a bit of a safeguard from curious animals.  In fact, raccoons can tear right through the plastic....And do.....  The lid will "kind of" keep the flies out.
1,The gun boot 6 and bracket will accept a bolt action rifle with a large scope and seems to be reasonably rainproof as claimed.  The black molded hard case is roughly molded and clunky in appearance.  The hatchback opening is a big improvement over the model 4 but difficult to open and will not open far enough to stay up so it constantly tries to fall on scope when extracting gun.  The foam lining hangs up on the gun and tries to come out with it making rifle removal a three handed and annoying process. The case has a drum like quality and is very noisy.  The bracket is advertised to be universal fit, but would not install on a Honda Foreman 400 without drilling holes as it would not line up on factory rack.  I get the impression that Kolpin did no actual field testing of this product as its shortcomings are immediately obvious in use.  The idea is great, but this product is way overpriced and needs significant improvement.
1,Item description stated 5x5 bolt patern...i found out while on side of road with a flat it was wrong patern. Not sure if description was wrong or the person packaging messed up but it caused a lot of headache for me.
1,1998 Durango I believe has no cabin filter.	This is listed as it will fit my SUV but close inspection cannot	find placement location. Appears not to have one.	 I checked on Dodge forum & confirmed NO	cabin air filter exists for 1st generation Durango----fwiw
1,Great idea but seems to need further development and testing.  The O-ring threads past the lugs in pan, therefore not effective as a seal... The O-ring is missing after one oil change thus is now no different than original plug.  (7.3L IDI, 1990 Ford)
1,I'm sorry, two stars because it's bad perform.	any time is start any time does not function correctly.	Also, design is good.
