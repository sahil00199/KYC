0,I just finished the waffle vest. It was only my third attempt at an intermediate pattern, and it came out very nice. The instructions are easy to follow, and there was a lot of useful information. Worth the money.
0,It was funny and entertaining.  It is a good beach book.  you don't need to be a rocket scientist to enjoy it.
0,Well written, good characters. Held my interest from the first to the last.

0,Great book for the times in which we live.  If you're interested in the effect of government intervention in the free market this is your book.		The quote that best sums up the book is from Henry Morgenthau - FDR's Treasury Secretary after 8 years of increased government spending to help with the depression:		"We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work ... After eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started ... And an enormous debt to boot!"		I hope we learn from the past.
0,love little feat, so happy to have read this interesting book.
0,Excellent book.  I found it very hard to put down.  I like all his books and I wish there were more.  I hope there will be more.
0,Book is good and pictures are colorful. Book is fitting for 2 or four years old. The book is short but well written and entertaining
0,Good story development. Good characterization. I've had several bad experiences lately with ebooks; this one proved good writing is possible.
0,I read this as a teen, back when it was relatively new. What I like is Gerrold's thesis about television drama and what elements are needed, in what combination, to make a series successful. This is not a book of Star Trek trivia, but more an analysis of what makes a good Star Trek script and how the Star Trek fan base got its start. Written in Gerrold's slightly wry and intelligent voice. If only he had given us more original episodes!
0,The stories are very nice to read to children or for them to read themselves. It is a calming book.
0,My granddaughter is a 3rd grade school teacher, and also an avid collector of American Girl products.  This item was purchased as a Christmas gift for her.  The doll is darling and of very high quality and will be a wonderful addition to her collection.  It was very well priced.
0,This chilling account will hit you hard and make you think about how close the tipping point can be.  This novel is 300 pages of riveting fiction that I couldn't put down.  There is room for a sequel and I truly hope Sheehan-Miles is diligently working on one as I write this review.  His character development and plot progression will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I had to put it down a few times, take a deep breath, and just think about the decisions these characters were forced to make by events and machinations totally out of their control.  This is a story of slippery slopes, preserving liberty at all costs, and the sacrifices that requires.
0,I have fallen in love with this series and all the things they go through on a day to day bases. The books all make you feel like you are watching the story unfold. Gwen Keebler is hiding from her past and does not trust very easily , she meets her best friends dad and even with the fourteen years difference she has feelings for Retired Brigadier General Dale Bryant . Will she let people in this time and stay in one place? I would recommend this book.
0,How can we not love this book, any story about any of the lovely Winston Brothers is a good story :) - I like that the characters instroduced, like Shelly is ia little quirky and not just rich and beautiful and perfect like in many books - not that Penny Reid ever creates the modellesque girl leads. Looking forward to the the next 2 books :)
0,Loved the book. I learned so much about America's greatest president. Wish we could have more presidents like him. It would be a better world.
0,I've listen to this alot./Very well done. It keeps me interested. Jack keeps it funny and interesting at the same time!
0,I love this series and highly recommend it to everyone that likes this kind of story. I started reading young adult when I got a book for Christmas. Every since then I look for all of these and Jayde Scott is a fantastic author that keeps me wanting more. I have down loaded all of her books since the first one and have not been disappointed yet.
0,This classic study of the economics of baseball, specifically the numbers driven Oakland As of the early 2000s, is rightly considered a classic. Describing how Billy Beane, the general manager of the As at the time, brought in your statistically minded analysts to take a hard, dispassionate look at his players, and who could make the biggest bang for the smallest buck. Its a great read.
0,I cannot begin to tell you how much I thoroughly enjoyed this piquant telling of the tale of Milicent Le Sueur. Perfectly and perkily narrated by Jan Ross [AUDIO], this cheerfully bizarre tale of a woman who mentally erases her former identity to become a bag lady very subtly casts a spotlight on the plight of homelessness and the wide variety of people whose lives are not standard nine-to-five suburban fantasies. Meanwhile, our charming heroine, when approached correctly, displays amazing powers of observation and proves infinitely resourceful in solving several murders. Plan to be enchanted!		  Disclaimer:  "I was given this free review copy audiobook at my request and have voluntarily left this review."
0,The book has some great suggestions for those trying to write the next "great novel" while making a living.
0,i am enjoying this book
0,This book is probably the most difficult of the three in the Border Trilogy. McCarthy pulls out all the philosophical, linguistic, and metaphysical stops in his writing here, to an extent beyond even his other  famous work, "Blood Meridian". It was tough going, working  through the shifting narrative voices, the textual structure (and lack  thereof), the absurd and the profound -- and that's not even considering  the tragic plot. McCarthy creates a hero in this book, Billy Parham, quite  different from the hero in the first book of the trilogy. Billy is not the  elegiac mystery that John Grady Cole, of "All the Pretty Horses",  is; rather, we are plunged deep into understanding and compassion for him.  He seems to be our viewpoint to the nth degree. This of course makes the  things he goes through in the tragic plot of the novel, so much more  incisive to a reader's mind and heart. Difficult is the word for this book  -- difficult and rich.
0,It's really difficult to say more good things about Kristen, she's literally out of this world! Loved this series, a lot. I thought it was going to be very hard since Ilsa was very loved in the fantastical world, but KA managed to make it happen and in a very real way. Loved Apollo, hated when he was a jerk but he had more, a lot more good things, very good things. Loved the scene when Lahn makes a rescue.... sigh deeply.... loved him.	Can't wait for more KA books, don't care which series, i just want more books from her and faster, hehehe and actually meet her in person, maybe someday my dream will come true
0,Pat Barker can do no wrong.  She puts you into the lives of her characters and explores the complexity of relationships at a deep and profound level .
0,Archmage continues the epic Legend of Drizzt series by R.A. Salvatore; a tale that is among the longest fantasy series ever produced. That is an awful lot of books following this lone Drow, but somehow, Mr. Salvatore continues to keep the stories fresh and exciting after all this time.		The tale begins with the War for the Silver Marches having ended in the defeat of the orcs and their allies the Drow of Menzoberranzan. Naturally, the dwarves of the three citadels are overjoyed at their hated enemies defeat and banishment to the distant mountains, and none more so that Bruenor Battlehammer, who sees this victory as the first step in finishing up business that eluded him in his first life. And so he immediately turns his attention from rebuilding the Silver Marches to rallying a force of dwarves to follow him to their ancient homeland of Gauntlgrym, where he intends to drive out its new inhabitants and reclaim it for his people.		The dwarven task will not be easy, however, because the Drow citizens of the city of QXorlarrin are the main residents of ancient Gauntlgrym, and they intend to keep it. But the Drow (as usual) are distracted by the constant in-fighting of the Menzoberranzan royal houses. These chaotic groups busily weaving intricate webs of intrigue between themselves; each house hoping to raise their own standing by seeing to the humiliation or destruction of the others within Goddess Lolths city. And if that wasn't enough, behind the scenes Lolth herself is busy expertly instigating it all. Her true motives remain hidden, but her initial desire is revealed, as she tricks an unsuspecting ally into slowly planting within Archmage Gromph Baenres mind the idea to cast a spell that will surely result in the destruction of the drow themselves!		The Companions of the Hall, meanwhile, come to yet another fork in their road of friendship. The reincarnated companions of Drizzt having helped save him and now having aided Bruenor in setting right the threat of Many-Arrows. In many ways they have fulfilled their obligation to one another. And some among them begin to wonder if they should remain together or part ways to pick back up with their new lives. (Their answer might even surprise you.)		From this beginning, Salvatore weaves his familiar brand of sword and sorcery. This Drizzt concoction filled with rousing sword fights, intricate subterfuge, godly machinations, and brief interludes of character introspection. Yes, there are page after page of Drizzts every action and sword stroke during his duels. And, yeah, Catti-brie continues to collect powers like they are pebbles on a mountain hillside. But it is all so very familiar, so comfortable that it doesnt detract from the story, because this is Drizzt . . . and Catti-brie . . . and Bruenor . . . and all the rest out having their usual amazing adventures. It is suppose to be fun and fantastical and large-than-life. I mean, that is what Drizzt is all about, right?		Even as I ask that question and insinuate my own feelings about what my answer would be, I realize that many might be disappointed in this novel. Well, actually, I know some long-time readers are, because Ive read their reviews or heard their criticisms spoken aloud. The sentiment being that this is just more of the same. Another quest to retake a long-lost dwarven homeland by Bruenor and his friends. One that is a pale reflection of earlier quests to retake Mithral Hall or uncover Gauntlgrym. Each obstacle, each decision, each personal moment of this band harkening back to previous books and similar situations from earlier in the series.		Well, after hearing and digesting those criticisms of Archmage, Im not going to try to refute them.  It really isn't my job to do so anyway. I mean, Im just a reviewer, who expresses my personal feelings about the novels I read.  Im not a Drizzt expert. I don't pretend to be. So while I might vaguely recall this or that being similar to something I read in the initial trilogy two decades ago, it didn't keep me from enjoying the sword and sorcery fun dished out by the author here.		So if you haven't tried Drizzt yet or have been away for a while, pick this one up, because Mr. Salvatore is still brewing a really smooth blend of sword and sorcery adventure, and it goes down really easily.		Wizards of the Coast and Netgalley provided this book to me for free in return for an honest review. The review above was not paid for or influenced in any way by any person, entity or organization, but is my own personal opinions.
0,This is a great story about falling in love and believing in that love. Reeve is an out of work actor his last job has ended and the second job he has between acting gigs just put him on 1 week unpaid leave. Sutton is looking to be the director of a new "next big thing" movie but first she has to land the job. When she meets with the producers they have heard of a Sutton being engaged to her boyfriend just recently and they think it is her. So that she does not loose this chance of a lifetime Sutton goes looking for an actor to play this fictional fiance in comes Reeve's. However what started as pretend for both of them is starting to feel pretty darn real however how can either of them believe this not just part of the job but something more. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
0,So great.  I wish she could write more of these
0,This was my favorite book of the series so far.....absolutely loved the chemistry between Graham and Mallory!  Adriana is a wonderful storyteller and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!
0,Great series. Love the books.
0,Lots of emotions. You will not be disappointed. A heartwarming story.  Couldn't put it down.
0,K.L. Slater is a new author to me so I was full of excitement and apprehension when I first started to read Blink.  To say I was blown away is a bit of an understatement really	Recently widowed Toni and her young daughter, Evie are leaving their old life behind and moving to Nottingham.  Tonis mum lives locally and feels her daughter and granddaughter both need a fresh start.  They have a house, Evie is offered a place at St Saviours primary school and Toni manages to find a small part time job in a local estate agents doing what she loves.  But Toni has a secret.  A secret which she believes only she knows about.  But others are watching and they're watching closely enough to work it out for themselves.  Evie is in danger.  Tonis secret has made her daughter the centre of someone elses attention and its all Tonis fault		Outstandingly good!  This is the first book Ive read in a while that Ive really immersed myself in.  I went through so many emotions whilst reading which always makes a book a favourite read for me.  There were times I felt genuine sadness and empathy for Toni, and other times I despised her and wanted to give her a good shake!  The chapters are either set in the present day or three years ago and told from several different perspectives.  The chapters narrated by Evie broke my heart, pure and simple.  K.L. Slater manages to write the 5 year old voice so incredibly well that I was near to tears at times.  I should add that I have a 6 year daughter myself so I could easily picture her speaking in a similar way to Evie and having similar thoughts.		The tagline of this book is no understatement; a gripping psychological thriller with a killer twist youll never forget.  It sounds like marketing mumbo jumbo and something you should take with a pinch of salt.  Let me tell you though, the tagline, its true.  There is a brilliantly crafted twist which makes this book go from a great read to a fantastic, remember it for some time to come read.  I couldn't quite believe what I was reading and had to go back and re-read the section again.  It happens so subtly, so beautifully that you almost miss itonly to realise shortly afterwards what is going on.  Superb writing!		Would I recommend this book?  Of course I would.  Its a completely mesmerising tale which I devoured from its shocking buzzing start to its explosive end.  I cant wait to read more from K.L. Slater.  Shes definitely on my authors to watch list now.  The characters make this story; from the repulsive TA, Miss Watson to Bryony, the overbearing, hateful boss to Toni, the barely coping, newly single mother.  All brilliant, all wonderfully written.  Blink gave me goosebumps.		Five out of five stars.		I chose to read and review an eARC of Blink.  My thanks to Bookouture and K.L. Slater for providing me with a copy.  The above review is my honest and unbiased opinion.
0,as expected
0,Good stuff not the new Harry potter lifelike I thought lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol good bye
0,Thick plot, fast paced. Good character development .  More info about guns that I cared for.  Good summer reading .
0,This is a compelling memoir not only for the extraordinary story it tells but for the author's ability to share the emotional journey she took as one of seven children in the home of survivalist parents who made no effort to ensure her education. Westover's maternal grandparents were horrified when their daughter married her rough, farmer boyfriend. Although all of them were Mormon, it was clear that he was a person apart from the community, and later, Tara recognized that he was certainly unstable and possibly mentally ill. This did not deter him from becoming the absolute patriarch of his family. Distrustful of the government and medical establishment, he did not even register her birth until she was nine. Siblings taught her how to readthe Bible and the Book of Mormon.		Although I was curious about survivalists and about Mormonism, I was unprepared to learn about these things from the inside out, as it were. Her father, living in Idaho, had clearly internalized the botched government attempts to address the family of Randy Weaver, but his paranoia was his own. And like a lot of zealots, he carried his family along with him. Until you read about the internal family dynamics, it's difficult to imagine how her mother could have been convinced to become a midwife with no medical training. But that's what happened. She was forced to observe another midwife, and despite having no interest in it, assisting that midwife until she established her own (lucrative) practice among survivalists. Later, she became a preparer of homeopathic medicines and then a healer who used some sort of click technique to channel the power of God.		Only by reading this book can you imagine what courage and audacity Tara developed to earn her doctorate in history, but it's all herefrom preparing and acing the ACT exam to get into college at around 17 to finally earning a doctorate from Cambridge University. Although this memoir did nothing to soften my attitude toward survivalists (and patriarchs), it did make me sympathetic to the Mormon educators  and elders that the author encountered. Where else but an institution like Brigham Young University might she have found the sympathetic guidance to face her academic inadequacies and social awkwardness? And where else might a teacher spotted her as someone with enormous potential?		Fortunately, the author doesn't take herself too seriously, and the narrative is full of amusing stories that help balance the bleakness. One of my favorite asides came early in the book when Tara, having been taught by her father that no one but a whore reveals what is below her collarbone and above her ankles, encounters her first roommate. The young woman is wearing a tank top and sweat pants with the word JUICY across the derriere. Somehow, she Tara plunges forward into the next phase of her education. What an inspiration!
0,A must have
0,Ever since I found the first book in the Sky Brooks series I've been hooked! I can't wait for the next one and the next after that and so on and so on!!
0,I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.  I love the Caribbean and love cruising so I was intrigued by the title of the book.  This author did not disappoint.  She gives us the murder weapon right away but weaves her way through the story to bring out the killer.  Our sleuth, Kayla Sanders, has been invited back to Constellation Cruise Lines as a published travel guide author to sell and promote her book.  Four years prior, Kayla left her pursers job with CCL frustrated and broken hearted after finding that the company's policy was to only promote males to leadership positions.  The heart break was that her boyfriend, the man she was making lifetime plans with, was making time with other women.  The author, Diane Rapp, gives a  "behind the scenes" look at the ships crew and introduces the characters in a unique way that made me connect with them.  We get to travel the islands with Kayla as she looks for new material to update her guide book.  She manages to island hop while looking for clues and confirming alibis. Kayla and her new friend, the ships magician, work together to find who murdered her ex-boyfriend and Chief Purser on the Aurora, Patrick MacIntyre.  Of course, some romance was woven into the story and I did think it a bit "mushy" at times, but I enjoyed sleuthing along with the characters.  I appreciate the authors effort to give us some island history along the way.
0,Contrasts in culture, technologies, traditions, beliefs; and still the characters pull together for the common good.  ..something that is missing in Washington...
0,Precious
0,Enjoyed the concept of changing your age for one day and realizing that maybe what and who you are isn't so bad.  Nice story.
0,Mary Roach answers all your questions about being in a space ship and more. Try her other books,Stiff, Rabid and Gulp.
0,Living in the Bay, I'd only heard a little about this guy. The structure of this book lures you in: the anonymous pervert kid, various suspects, just the right amount of forensic science detail and subsequent trial excerpts. Perfect.
0,Clever writing.  It's one of those thought-provoking reads with some comedic relief to keep it interesting.
0,Unlike one of the reviewers, I didn't find the hero too super to enjoy.  I like my heroes better than most as far as their abilities and insights and balanced by internal conflicts like this one.  This was a nice combination of eccentric characters that rang true to the region (according to the tales told by one of my friends who had relatives there).  Since I have not been there but have heard of the region, it was a satisfactory somewhat educational journey into the inner workings and attitudes of the locals in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan .  The plot was sufficiently fast paced, and the characters and their concerns were developed enough to keep one caring about the outcome.  Not award winning fare, but still a nice read.  I would read another in the series.
0,It's a classic for good reason.  A must read for everyone.
0,I really enjoyed the suspense plot in the book but was a little disappointed by the romance part and I would have liked a little more science. all in all it was a great book.....just not as good as concrete evidence.

0,Amazing comic, ranging from Batman's early days to the polished 21st century look. My favorite out of the eight would be the 6 days of Scarecrow, I'm not going to give away anything but it was my personal favorite a recommended buy!
0,I've read almost all of her books because she is always full of surprises. This was true for this book, too.
0,Thoroughly enjoyed this classic-styled Harlequin Romance.
0,Great and funny story. I really enjoyed this book. I've read several books by Susan this one has been the funniest! I highly recommend it!
0,Awesome
0,What I Thought:  You don't even know how excited I was at the opportunity to review an Adventures in Odyssey book.  This is the stuff of my youth, sitting around the radio with my sister listening to Whit and the kid's have adventures at Whit's End.  It's so cool.  This is my children's first introduction to AIO, and having just purchased some of the CDs for them to listen to, and was excited to see how they responded to the book.  While it is probably a little bit old for my five year old, she still sat and listened and actively engaged when something caught her ear.  My seven year old was definitely engaged and asked when we could read the next chapter.  I love the idea of introducing real, historical adventures to kids, in a way they can plainly understand.  In fact, I even learned a few things that even I hadn't known. This is a really exciting prospect - introducing history to my kids since both the hubby and I are huge fans.		What is even more awesome is that you can access curriculum that pairs well with the series.  And with a three book series that sounds like it could be something awesome.  I would love to explore the curriculum with my children and go further into the content with them, on a level they can understand.  Having some experience with Focus on the Family and the Adventures in Odyssey radio series and movies, there is no doubt in my mind that these books and accompanying curriculum would be awesome.
0,I absolutely loved the storyline in this book. It was such a fresh perspective to see life from the henchmen of super villains. I always wondered what happened to the poor henchmen who survived  after their evil leader was taken out my the super spies from secret services. The wit and humor in the book kept me laughing as I followed the escapades of Mark and loved to see the Henchman's book club evolved in such a fashion. It was a sad moment when I closed read the last words... as it was said in the book, when you truly enjoy a book you read every word including the notes at the end acknowledgements and advertisements because you do not want it to end... and I indeed read every word printed in the book and wanted more.		So to everyone wanting a great book told in the perspective of the bad guys, this book is for you.. buy it...it is TOTALLY worth it.		And to the Author: Thank you for bringing me a bit of joy at a time in my life when I really needed a good laugh.
0,Albeit the shift towards Swift, this NSHipster book provides crucial design patterns written in Objective-C. Swift is not fully ready for production use so this book is still quite valid, however there's rumors of a remake of this book in Swift...
0,This was another fun story by Penny Reid!  Her writings are highly intelligent and insightful.  They'll leave you laughing hysterically at one liners and then turn you around and broadside you with heartfelt endearments, welling up the peepers.
0,Totally love Dir Pitt, and this one did not disappoint. I'm a sucker for this sort of plot--the mysterious deaths, the "ghost ship" with one lovely survivor, the evil family--just the stuff I dream of reading about--and it's all here in one book.		If I could give it more than five stars I would. One of those reads that you keep thinking about long after you've finished. It has a place on my keeper shelf now! :)
0,Amazon has missed the distinction between the book and the movie - the reviews in this section are of the movie, not the book. I read the book years ago, its word for word what's in the movie, and great. But still, its a BOOK not a MOVIE!!:)
0,This is a romantic comedy with magic. It all fits together nicely and is an enjoyable read. When we meet Ally, she has been brooding over her breakup with James for over a year. Her friends are getting tired of it as well as her parents. Her mother had convinced her to go antique shopping with her to find a shelf. While at the market, she stumbles onto a vendor selling antique boxes. She picks one up and the old lady running the booth tells her that the "coffer" has chosen her. She puts it down and goes off to find her mother. Once she is home, she finds the coffer wrapped up in her bag. When she rubs it, a man appears. He is not a genie, he keeps telling her, but a man that was cursed centuries ago and put in the coffer. The magic and fun begin. When Ally finds out she gets five wishes, she starts with the superficial one of being able to change her appearance whenever she wants. She takes off some pounds, tones up and changes her hair. When it works she is thrilled. Money is next, then being able to read minds. The rest of the story is her effort to get James back. James unfortunately is now engaged to Vanessa, Ally's nemesis from work. Without spoiling the story suffice it to say, true love wins out. I do not normally read this type of book, but the author gave me the opportunity to read her book for an honest review and that is what I have done.		If you want a light, quick read with a little romance and fun, pick up this book, you won't regret it.
0,Good and teaching
0,This book as good, but it was far too drawn out. I ended up skipping over big chunks of it.
0,Great story. Lot of exciting action scenes. Have read all books in series and it just keeps getting better. Looking forward to next book.
0,Enjoyed the characters in this story and the plot twists. I actually predicted one of the plot twists, but not how it played out. Couldn't put it down once the main characters met.
0,OMG!!!! You will want to scream, cry and slap the s*** out of Chase in this book, but you will have to read to find out what happens.	The events that happen in this book are WOW! This book will have your heart racing.	I enjoyed this book, it is an amazing read.	What will happen to Chase and Allie?	Read this book to find out.
0,Weird things are happening at night in the Orsk store in Cuyahoga, Ohio- oh, let's just call it an IKEA store, even though the text in the book implicitly states that Orsk is a "knockoff" of IKEA... Anyway, recently the employees have gone home leaving a pristine store at quitting time, but then come in the next morning to find damaged furniture and ruined Kjerring bookshelves, excrement-smeared Brooka couches, torn draperies, foul odors, and extensive graffiti in the ladies room. And with Corporate due in from the home office on an inspection the next morning, Basil, the manager, has no intention of letting this vandalism continue. Basil volunteers two employees to stay with him and do floor sweeps all night in an attempt to catch whoever's doing the vandalism. But this is more than they are anticipating. They're in for the surprise of their lives... or their deaths.		I admit it- my wife and I are IKEA junkies, and "Horrorstr" is a horror story made for IKEA fans. The novel is designed and laid out like an IKEA catalog, with every chapter headed by a parody-perfect illustration and ad blurb for a fictitious piece of furniture, as well as treats like order forms, evaluations, and more.  And even these become progressively... unnatural... as you move towards the end. If you've been in an IKEA store you'll know exactly where the characters are and will find yourself chuckling at the reverential skewering of products, corporate philosophies, decor, and consumerism that pepper this novel.		The plot itself is frankly not spectacular, often derivative (the ground here has been well-trod), and a bit predictable- but the creepiness is tangible and when mayhem occurs, it pulls no punches. Plus, the fact that the action is set within a vast big-box store like IKEA (sorry, Orsk) makes the problem loom much larger than is often the case.		It's a fun tale, a must-read for the IKEA addict, and is worth getting for the book design, layout, and illustrations alone. Very enjoyable and recommended.
0,After I started reading this book, I did a search to see if the author was biased because he portrayed the Arabs as horrible people. Also I was shocked by the actions of the British after World War II. Both were apparently true. I thought after all the suffering of the Jews, that the Allies did as much as possible to help the Jews. But I was wrong. The British were certainly not as horrible as the Germans, but they did everything in their power to stop the Jews from establishing the Jewish country including putting them in camps if they tried to reach The Promised Land.	However, I enjoyed the story while I was learning the history. When I found out that my book club picked a Leon Urus book, I moaned. I had never read one before, but l knew they were lenghty. I discovered that the story and the history mesmerized me. I simply couldn't put it down.
0,In 2006, avid mountain climber Kelly James and two friends planned a climb of Mt. Hood outside Portland, Oregon just before Christmas. Holding Fast is the story of this ill-fated climb that only resulted in one body being recovered from the mountain after a "perfect storm" prevented rescuers from reaching James in time.		It's a deeply moving story of a family that shifts overnight into emergency mode in order to try to bring a husband, dad, and friend safely off the peak of one of our nations most challenging summits. The author of the book is James' wife, Karen, and she paints an incredible narrative in short, terse sentences that lead you through the book in 2-3 sittings.		Seeing the rescue effort from the families' perspectives is a powerful reminder that behind the news and media saturation in events like the 2006 rescue effort are real people who are thrust into surreal events. Holding Fast reveals a humbling portrait of humble, God-trusting people who cast all their hopes on their Creator and are subsequently devastated.		Author Karen James opens her heart to the reader in rare form allowing one to experience the tragedy anew but with great insight and personal investment.		I vaguely remembered the series of events two years ago, but I found myself more engaged in the story. Knowing that Kelley and his friends didn't make it off the mountain did not detract from the power of the story. Rather, the mysterious things revealed and "coincidences" that Karen shares during the story are enough to leave one shaking their head in at least curiosity, and at most, awe.		James also is candid about her grief process. I was uncomfortable at times with her deep absorption into her husband. At times, she came across as a person who had no life apart from him, whose identity was bound up solely in her husband. Even her faith seemed to be dependent on her husband's.		I noticed throughout the book that although she referred several times to their home church - Fellowship Bible Church of Dallas, an excellent, biblically-centered church - she only referred to God as "God." In fact, I grew increasingly bothered by that - not because it's wrong, but I have always been disturbed by the generic use of "God" in our society. It's safe. By using the word "God" you can refer to just about any vague deity and not offend anyone.		However, I was shocked when in the last paragraph of the book, she quoted 1 Peter 1.6-9 where Jesus Christ is revealed. Then, the last two words of her story are found in Part 4 of the two book - which encompasses two pages. Her last statement reveals more about her own faith journey than the failed rescue effort:		"I am very proud to say that I was not the greatest love of his life. That honor belongs to Jesus Christ."		In what I'm sure is her first book, Karen James has penned a spell-binding encounter that weaves sorrow and joy, soaring hope and crushing devastation into one tale.		I don't know how much perspective a person can have only a year out of such a devastating and grievous event, but the author allows us to enter into her journey - up to August 2007. The final two pages, in my opinion, may show us that the God that was referred to throughout the book was bringing Karen up a mountain to meet Him while He was taking Kelley off of another to be with Him.
0,Love the Hannah Swenson mysteries.
0,As usual a good read by Grisham.
0,Helping me in class with assignments.
0,If you are already an artist or have been drawing or painting for a couple of years, skip this book.  There's a lot of basics in it.  It covers form, perspective, shading and highlights, still life and landscapes.  Instruction on using different mediums, also.  I feel the best part of this book are the sections on the human body - drawing the figure, drawing hands and feet, drawing heads and faces.  And also an additional section on drawing children.  Most of us struggle with drawing and painting people.  You can get away with a little inaccuracy in landscapes or still lifes but not the human form or faces.  I'd recommend this book solely for the instruction of figures and portraits.  The rest of it is nice, too.  It would make a great gift for someone just venturing into the art world.  Nice size book and very detailed information.  Highly recommend!
0,The camera is so new that I don't think there are many other books out for it right now, maybe one. The menu system can be complex but the author does a good job of detailing the process of changing options throughout the menu system. Good info on learning the available functions on this wonderful and exciting camera system!
0,Ever wonder what the phrase "Men are visual" really means? Being a woman, I never really understood what that meant. But it was that question that this book promised to answer. And being curious, I knew it was one that I wanted to pick up.		There are a few things that this book does really well. First of all, within the first chapter, my question was answered... and honestly I was amazed at what that common phrase really means for the men in our lives. The explanations of what that phrase means are quite well done and I feel like while I can't relate, the book accomplished it's purpose and I would say that I understand it.		Also, I think this book does a wonderful job of moving in a direction and looks at what the visual nature of men really means for them and how that affects us. That visual nature means that there are particular responsibilities placed on women. If you've followed any of the buzz around this book, you'll find the authors fielding a number of attacks on that one point. Honestly, the authors expected that and mentions those arguments in the book. With that in mind, this is a book that may need to be read wtih a lot of prayer. Some of these truths are difficult to read about. But, Shaunti Feldhahn and Craig Gross present them tacfully and thoughtfully.		However, that same note is one of my complaints about the book. I feel like so much of it was spent on cautionary statements. I can see where they were needed and I didn't totally mind it. I just felt like the book was a bit heavy on those cautions and would have liked to have spend a bit more time on the other aspects the book has to offer.		And on a personal note: I read this book side-by-side with my husband. We read a chapter a day, and while this book is certainly designed to be read by women, he enjoyed it as well and it did give room for some good discussions between us. With that said, I have to agree with the authors that for some women, it may not be wise to jump into those discussions. But, in a relationship where husband and wife have good communication skills and can handle difficult conversations well, this is something that can help the information in the book become a bit more relevant.		**I received a copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are my own.**
0,Holy cow. So I started off thinking this was a simp! e boy meets girl and they fall in love..  Well it is but it has some serious twist and turns.
0,Great bible for young kids around 7 years old
0,Fresh from the havoc he caused in Washington in The Black Widow, the terrorist Saladin continues to orchestrate attacks in France and London.  Despite now being Head of the Office, Allon returns to the field to continue the search and destroy mission for the evasive terrorist.  The usual cast assembles, infiltrates Saladin's network  and pursues him into the hashish trade in Morocco.		Silva's story telling continues at his usual high level.  Pages turn quickly, and even though fictional, the reader learns a great deal about how international terror works and is funded.  As usual, Silva continually reminds the reader of previous Allon adventures.  This adds to the length of the story, but also serves as a useful refresher for regular readers or as needed background for those new to the series.  My only real complaint with Silva's writing is that he comes close to overusing repetition for dramatic effect.		This is one of the best in an excellent series.  Great suspense plus detailed information on the timely subject of international terrorism.  Recommend highly.
0,Good for beginners to moderate players
0,5 year old granddaughter  Loved this book and thinks kids her like it. She can't wait to get the dinosaur and snake book!!
0,Lot of information. Hope you like to read because there is a lot.
0,I deliberately got the unabridged version for two reasons. I feel it's a waste of effort to read a book if you're not going to read the book that the author intended. I have also noticed that abridged versions tend to remove material that the editor feels is irrelevant or not socially acceptable, not giving the reader opportunity to determine these things for themselves. In the case of Les Miserables it was eminently worth it. The book is given its epic scope by the wealth of historical detail and meandering political rhapsodizing. The translation is clear and easy to follow, with poetry translated in the footnotes so as not to ruin the beauty of the original.		I am halfway through the second out of five books in this volume. the plot thus far is as follows: Jean Valjean, a man who is by turns awful and luminous, is changed by a chance encounter which sets him on the road to rising greatness, until his greatness plunges him back into infamy. Meanwhile, a woman of common birth falls into ever greater hardship, inadvertently the fault of Jean Valjean, who at her deathbed promises to rear her only child, a daughter of seven years old. He encounters numerous fearsome obstacles in fulfilling this promise, but is now living with the girl in Paris.		This book was written during the chaotic period between the French Revolution and the Paris Commune. Victor Hugo looks unflinchingly at poverty, starvation, illness, aging, crime, government, wealth, drunkenness, child abuse, corruption, police brutality, and social upheaval. All of the minor characters are fully fleshed out and human. His villains are not cackling stereotypes from Disney movies. They are sickening in their realism: people who are blindly indifferent to evil, who moralize their actions, who are driven by prejudice to ruin lives, or have suffered to the point of deadness to empathy. His heroes and heroines are also characters of complex morality, doing or desiring to do evil and seeking to justify it to themselves. They are driven by fear and misery and are differentiated from the villains only by virtue of being sometimes compassionate and selfless. Despite this, there is little moral ambiguity. It is clear who you are meant to side with and Hugo never leaves you with any doubt as to why.		I can't wait to see what happens next!		If this book ends as good as it started, it will definitely be on my top ten ever.
0,I am listening to it daily.  I listen just before retiring for the day and for the first nine days of the year each day has been a parellel to my day.  I love the way Gods word finds the right words at the right time.  Thank you Beth Moore for another wonderful book. My small group will begin studying the book Entrusted by Beth Moore next week.  It is guaranteed to be a great study.
0,What an amazing read!! I love her books, I get so lost and forget about life itself!! I'd recommend to anyone I know!!
0,First off, the presentation - three books come in a box, with clear instructions on how to use them. One book is for mom, one's for your daughter, and one is a shared journal. My 9-year-old immediately had us filling out forms and drawing and doodling and telling each other secrets. It was pretty cool right away.		I really like this series from American Girl - we have other "Care and Keeping of" books, mostly devoted to teaching girls about what they can expect as they mature into teenagers. This is the first time I've encountered a book specifically for moms, and it's a really nice addition to this book series.		If your daughter is entering that awkward not-quite-teen phase, this will likely be a great help to both of you.
0,This was a fun little romp. I think Mr. Showalter is funnier when you can watch and listen to him delivering his material, but I got some good chuckles out of this nonetheless. When he says it's a book about trying to write a book he is not lying. This is not a memoir or an autobiography. It's a funny guy being silly, like really super silly. Every chapter could be a State or Stella bit. i understand why some reviewers, fans of his,	didn't really like the book. while there are some sharp moments, it's mostly just goofy stuff. But it's also somehow really inspiring. He's going through this process of figuring out how to write this book, at the same time it's a commentary on his life and the process he went through to figure out what he wanted to do and who he wanted to be, which I find so relatable as someone who kind of flits from bit to bit without much direction myself. So in that way, despite the author's best efforts to create a totally absurd deconstruction of a memoir, the book really did inspire me and give me a kind of motivational boost. It feels totally dumb to say so because of exactly how silly the book is, but yeah it's inspiring. His tendency to poke fun at himself is very refreshing, and there's that word... refreshing. Especially now six years after it was written and everyone is taking themselves so *expletive* seriously. Reading it was like hitting reset for me somehow.	Highlights include a chapter on good penis smell vs bad penis smell, romantic mix tape track list with explanations, and a head shot from his early acting days that is totally cringeworthy but also kinda cute.	Anyway that's too much of a review and analysis for a book that really is 100% silliness.
0,Imagine yourself sitting in front of the formal w3c standard(s) and trying to read it cover to cover...		I tried that and it is very hard, boring, and very unproductive.		Now, try to read it with this book as a companion -- you will find yourself understanding everything on the spot.		There are a lot of useful examples and explanations which are (in my opinion) missing from the standard's text. This is what makes this book so useful.		Also, the organization of the book makes it very easy to locate information you need and to use it as a reference book.		Trying to understand the fine details of the XML Schema standard and the capabilities of XML Schema? Trying to implement an XML parser or an XML validator? If so -- you will probably appreciate this book and will probably use it a lot!		Even now, several years later, I sill find it useful and revealing.
0,Buy this book. Awesome, awesome explanation of		how we are trully to love .		Thanks !
0,This was a required book for one of my college classes and I truly enjoyed it. It has great information for Ideas and Essays.
0,I feel so sorry for those other readers who haven't enjoyed The Map of Time because they couldn't make it past the large number of pages, unusual third-person POV that insists on making extraneous comments, and loosely connected division of the novel. The number of pages, though it could have easily been cut down by cutting out information not directly pertinent to the story, didn't bother me. The Map of Time is not a book to be breezed through, but Palma's wonderful writing hardly makes it a tough, slow, boring read either. The narrator, who occasionally interjects commentary, adds a bit of humor to the story (there are also little satirical and humorous notes added in other ways) and has a certain purpose revealed only at the end. As to the division of the novel into three distinctly individual stories, while unexpected, it is not unpleasant.		The Map of Time is definitely a unique and surprising book (and I'll try not to rant incoherently about its awesomeness). Its three stories are not what readers expect from the back cover and other plot synopses - at times I was wondering when H.G. Wells and the sci-fi bits were going to appear - but this does not subtract from how wonderful they are. Palma makes the Victorian era interesting, working in historical tidbits and occasionally adding humor as well, poking fun at historical personages, events, customs, and even himself. In some ways, the first two parts of the book can be considered an exercise in the gullibility of both readers and the Victorian English populace as Palma investigates various methods of time travel, but the novel is still highly enjoyable. It's not for every reader (see the first paragraph of my review), but hopefully many others will be able to get wrapped up in Palma's narratives. This is a book that readers can lose themselves in for hours.		I was under the impression that this was a stand alone novel, but apparently it's part of a trilogy. When I discovered this, I came about as close to jumping up and down in joy as I've ever done over a book.		Disclaimer: I received my copy of this book from the publisher in return for an honest review.
0,I was told this series was better than Harry Potter.  So I hesitantly picked it up.  I am a huge Harry Potter fan.  I have read the books and seen all the movies dozens of times.  Fablehaven excels, it is now a favorite alongside of Mr. Potter in my house.  Seth doesn't disappoint as the annoying, mischievous little brother.  Every time an idea pops into his head.  I would hold my breath waiting to see if he had learned his lesson from his previous escapade.	Kendra is endearing and fun.  She is more sensible and balances her brother out.  They have the typical brother sister relationship with the added stress of having to deal with witches, dragons, and chickens that can spell.	Fablehaven is a wonderful journey.  Share it with your kids.  We read it out loud as a family, and it was such an enjoyable read.  Check out Mull's other series, not one has disappointed us.
0,I happened to start reading this book while visiting my mom, and became so engrossed in the opening chapter that I had to take it home and finish it, promising her I would return it.  The characters are interesting but complicated. (I should have written up a character list to help keep them straight.)  The plot lines are compelling.  I do realize I have come in at the end of a long series.  But the understated writing and Moscow setting are intriguing enough that I will probably go back to the beginning of the series and read about this quasi-86 Precinct of Russia.
0,You can almost always count on a Janet Daley book to be great.  This is no exception.  A radio show therapist is having her patients targeted by a murderer, and then she becomes the target.  Texas Ranger, Ian Pierce comes to the rescue. By some strange coincidence he is an old boyfriend of Dr. Caityn Rhodes, the therapist, and the romantic clock starts ticking.
0,I read this immediately after reading Lawrence's book and perhaps I should have read this one first as it contextualizes the "Seven Pillars." Lawrence's book is marvelous but can get confusing with it's many many characters and places described absent placement in the larger historical or geographical scheme. Together the two books give the reader the necessary temporal and physical layout of the region and war that anchors Lawrence and also fully animates this great biography by Anderson.
0,I really enjoyed this easy to read book.  The pages flew by and I learned a lot about how an amazingly famous person, feeling washed up at age 27, was able to reinvent himself.  A very enjoyable read.
0,Great read on the history of the emerging field of chaos theory as a loose multi-disciplinary field applicable to almost every discipline and yet adopted by no discipline as its own.  The pioneers are as varied, free-thinking, maverick, and ostracized as the discipline itself.  Approach this book from the standpoint of 'history of chaos science' rather than 'technical introduction to chaos theory,' as the work doesn't quite take upon itself to teach the reader the rigorous field of chaos theory even at an introductory level.  It is a book for the lover of science for science sake and a qualitative introduction to chaos at that.
0,What an awesome story this was.  I devoured it like a bag of gummy bears.  Can't wait for Book Two.
0,This book is worth the apple pie and double buttery crust recipes alone. I made the coconut cream pie and it was good too. I have her other vegan cookie book too. I intend to try everything in the book and I do recommend this one if you need vegan pie recipes.
0,No need for fear. This product offers an excellent price for a well wrapped, like-new box of lotr. This is an outstanding piece of work for any collector or fan, coming with awesome artwork as well as 2 maps in the Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. The hardcover and pages came flawless and shipping was within expected date.
0,An excellent guide to those who are comming from another language
0,I read this in a day. I'm not a rapid reader; I may read an abundant amount, but not in a short period of time. Not one single negative comment comes to mind when the word "Margarettown" is mentioned. I absolutely adored this book. Completely unconventional, very unique, and brilliantly written.		The characters are so believable and true, you feel like they are all close friends (yes, even fictitious...May, Mia, Maggie, Marge, Greta, and Old Margaret; crucial to the book!). I also respect how Zevin comes across as a genuine intellect, not narcissistic. New favorite writer anyone?		Surprised no one recommended this book sooner to me. Read it, now.
0,The series of books are so good I could not wait to read the next book. You will not be disappointed.
0,Even though I was the one who subscribed to this book to read and review, my grandchildren ended up reading and loving it. On a side note, always buy books to enlighten and spoil your kids and grandkids with love. I really liked the authors fine message in the book. Hes right up there with the best with the simplicity and effectiveness with which he delivers the message. Books like these are an important key to growth and character development. They are the first steps to attaining educational success. This childrens book was wonderful and I recommend you get it for your kids, and also teach them how to read.
0,Great book and great service.
0,Yet another great book, he has out done himself again
0,Hitler's Fall Guys is an unusual book in that it is written by one of the greatest of American aviation heroes, Colonel Walker "Bud"  Mahurin, about his one-time enemies, the men of the Luftwaffe. Mahurin, the  only man who has scored victories in the European, Pacific and Korean  theaters of war AND been shot down in all three of them as well, does two  things. One, he presents familiar material in an entirly new light,  offering insights never before presented, and based on his vast combat  experience. Two, he presents entirely new material, again based on his  unusual combination of experience and insight.  Throughout the book, Bud  maintains exactly the right tone of respect for the achievements of the  Luftwaffe and hard-hitting analysis of its failures. This book fills in a  lot of loose ends that books by former members of the Luftwaffe leave  unanswered. A fine book by a true hero!

0,Just like new! Great service, very quick! This book will be come a classic in my classroom and will be loved for years to come!
0,Good read.
0,This is an amazing story of unexpected turns and twists, and of stamina, determination, and the pursuit of fairness and justice.  I enjoyed it very much and found it hard to put down.
0,Emotional, heartbreakingly raw read.  Tina Saxon certainly loves to keep the readers hanging. Bring on book 3
0,This Book is amazing for sculptors of all kind, very detailed and easy to understand, in my opinion is the best anatomy book i know, totally recommended... worth every dollar...
0,I have read them all and can't wait for the next.  Never a boring moment in any of these books
0,It's was a gift.  I hope she likes it.  It looked neat.
0,If you love america's test kitchen tv show, I highly reccommend this book. I love it, so glad I spent the money. The only other cookbook I use as much would be joy of cooking. They expain how and why they do everything and it has a great list of kitchen must haves from ingrediants to appliances. Every recipe I've tried has turned out great!
0,Nicolette moved away from her hometown in Cooley Ridge, right after her best friend had gone missing. A family crisis brought her back to the same old town, but now quite different. She, together with her brother Daniel, had to sort everything out about their father's failing health and their childhood home.		And then a neighbor went missing, and soon we are taken back to a very different and unique narrative, starting from Day 15 to Day 1.		Wow!		I never thought I'd be rendered speechless after reading this suspense thriller from Megan Miranda. I didn't have the words to describe how I felt when I got to the last page. The story was uniquely presented, the characters were all kinds of complex and relatable, the thrill and excitement in finding out the perpetrator was just awesome!		I've yet to read Megan Miranda's other books, but if All the Missing Girls is an indication, I am confident that I would enjoy all her other story creations.		This has been a mind-blowing, nerve-racking, bone-chilling read, narrated in a twist.		In other words, this is a must read..
0,I loved this book it is awesome. I liked it because it had good word choice and if you have read Geronimo Stilton before you know how he acts he is a bookmouse, but he never gets out of an adventure. I think it is for all ages. If 3 or under an adult might have to read it. Anybody would love it. You should go ahead and read it. I hope you take my advice, and read flight of the Red Bandit
0,This book was surprisingly good! Not a piece of literary art by any means, but a very good zombie novel. I found it to be an appropriate length, leading off in a manner that drew you in and introduced the characters of the story. Even though there was an obvious main character in Josie the sewage truck driver, many other people were introduced that were entertaining and really added a lot to the book. Mr. Bebb was able to give details about many characters and hop back and forth between them without making it confusing.	The zombie apocalypse was explained "believably". I hate it when some books don't even say how the dang thing got started. This version had the added bonus of insane, homicidal, Mexican immigrants! Sweet ! Not to give away spoilers but I loved how it also followed through with an END.  Not just a helicopter flying away in the sunset.	There were a few characters who weren't heard from (Yugo?). I noticed that there is another book that follows this one. I'll have to get that one now to see if it follows along with the same people. I'm gonna bepissed if they lived just to die in the next book!
0,Loved! Just as I have with all of Rachael's books, I loved this, as did my daughter who couldn't wait to read it either. Sam has been featured in the first two Meet Your Match books, and it was great to see her get a story of her own (although I had a hard time at first imagining how old she was!). I loved both Sam and Colton and the way they balanced each other out. They had some tough decisions to make and I love the way it all turned out! Another favorite for our family!
0,I thoroughly enjoyed this book due to Doerr's excellent storytelling and writing style!!!
0,This is the third volume in the TiC series. It is excellent. Vol. III covers maintenance, crew roles, and has unit photos left out of the previous volumes or newly found. In a perfect world, this book would have been published first to make many of the details in the previous books more understandable, but it is a delight to have even now as a summary for how the crews cared for their weapon and fought inside it. Maybe not every Tiger was photographed, but after these three volumes, you wonder how anyone got missed!
0,This well-written story did exactly what I wanted it to do. It swept me away to another time and place. It's apparent Ms. Matthews is knowledgeable of the ins and outs of Victorian society. Her expertise made it an enjoyable read.
0,I really enjoyed this medieval Christian romance.  The story moved well and kept my interest throughout.  I look forward to reading more by this author
0,A stunning book. A selection from this book was featured on Poetry Daily and I was intrigued by the economy, compression and use of language. Still, you don't imagine that anyone could maintain such virtuosity for seventy pages. Wrong. I am a voracious reader of modern poetry; this book stunned me. Surprising nouns and verbs juxtaposed in surprising ways at every turn. The commonplace constantly elevated to the extraordinary. The everyday brutality of fact, as it presents itself in nature, appreciated for its kaleidoscopic thusness. And I read the whole book (in one sitting) before I discovered that the cover illustration was painted by the poet as well. Rarely have I seen a better marriage of cover and content. The painting tells you everything you need to know in terms of form, color and energy--and all the rest--about the poetry. The people at Copper Canyon have come through again, bless them. All that and, if the title (Flood Song) and the arrangement of the work throughout the book (such intoxicating celebration of negative space) mean anything, it is one poem. No titles. No numbers. No pretension whatsoever. The words working closely with the space to create a single arc of meaning. One poem. It is a rare thing for a poet to be so comfortable with telling you all there is to know about himself. Sherwin Bitsui does that here. Ultimately, that's poetry.
0,This book is a quick read and laugh out loud funny. I think most women will relate to her stories and struggles to find a balance. Her writing is very open you will feel like you want her as your friend.  I think we will be seeing and hearing much more of Sarah Colonna.
0,This was a great read!  I knew a lot of this stuff already from prior research, but to have it all together in one book is very handy!
0,Excellent!!!
0,I love this series, but I had already read this one under the name Shannon Drake.	I purchased this thinking it was going to be a new release.  Very disappointed.
0,Nothing new here, but told from a new African perspective.  We older feminists have given up making feminism easier to swallow.  I don't seem to mind if people gag a little trying to get the truth down.  This gentle woman author is still trying to make the lesson more palatable.  I read that this was issued to all middle school kids in Sweden, and wondered why.  I now understand that the recipe has been altered, sweetened to hide all the bitterness; now anyone can drink from this blend.  There will still be a lot of indigestion.
0,First, I would say that, if you haven't read "You," you should start there. While " Hidden Bodies" is a great story on its own, Joe Goldberg's complexity is best understood across the complete timeline.		Having said that, I didn't expect that Kepnes could outdo her work in "You," but I loved this story even more. Believable? Maybe not, but this is a 21st century Bluebeard and the fairy tale ending is as magical as you could want.		Kepnes also manages to nail the sardonic humor of the "intelligentsia," the disdain of the younger generation for all things traditional, and the irony that is the old becoming the new and the new becoming the old. Whether you're into literature or pop fiction, horror movies or "Friends," there is something here for you. Enjoy!
0,This book continues the exciting storyline we first read in The Line, then builds to a dramatic climax near the end of the book and the end of one of the characters I've come to like from earlier.  It's a real ride, and highly recommend it.
0,Twisted Threads by Lea Wait is the first book in the brand new cozy series called Mainely Needlepoint. I adored this book! The characters were charming and the settings were delightful. I liked Angie right from the beginning and quickly fell in love with her Gram, Charlotte. I was hooked by the first sentence of this book.		Angie comes back home after her mother's body is discovered. Her mother had been missing for several years and most people in the town assumed she had just run off with a boyfriend. Angie has worked with a PI in Arizona. She plans to use her knowledge to not only help solve her mother's murder, but also to help her Gram find the man who has taken advantage of her needlepoint business and not paid her or the other needlepointers.		I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end. Twisted Threads by Lea Wait is a definite page turner that had me staying up late to keep reading. I liked that there were two mysteries going on simultaneously. The characters and the mystery plot kept me turning the pages as fast as I could. The story was fast-paced and I liked the edginess of Angie. This is well-written and I am very much looking forward to the next book in the series!		I received an advanced copy of the ebook for review purposes - this did not influence my opinion in any way.
0,Tis is the most amazing Masters and Mercenaires ever! I've been a long time fan of this series and I love this story of Theo and Erin's journey. You have to read it to see if it's a happily ever after.	It is a thrill ride that will keep you reading long into the night. I wanted to climb inside my e reader and grab Hope McDonald by the neck myself!!!	The icing on the cake is the guys are all together again and they will have you holding your ribs when Ian is leading their conversations. The story has it all, suspense , thrills, laughter, hot	Alphas, and so much more,	My recommendation is to go get all the series and meet all the Mastedd and their stories. Can't wait for the next one.	Five stars is not enough for this one,
0,I'd seen part of the movie Roots about 30 years ago and my only true memories from the movie was Levar Burton as Kunta Kinte being beaten until he relented and acknowledged that his new name was Toby.  That small memory does little justice to the extensive work of the book "Roots"--never mind the fact that that doesn't occur in the book.		Fast forward 30 years and I decided to read this very intimidating book--both in size and material.  The book was on my wife's shelf collecting dust when I casually mentioned that I'd like to read it.  I never felt too pressed to actually do so because there was a movie after all: if I want to know what's in the book I can always watch the movie.  Eventually, I began reading other books I had and I was on my way to purchasing more books to read when I stopped myself and said, "I'm not buying another book to read until I read what's here in my own house."		Two weeks after cracking the cover I was absolutely thrilled that I took the time to read this gem.  As I was reading it I thought it was excellent as a fictitious representation of what happened during slavery.  When I read that it was a fairly accurate account of Alex Haley's actual lineage the book was no longer merely excellent, it approached sacredness.		There is no amount of praise for what Alex Haley did putting this book together.  Much like a paleontologist is able to construct a full dinosaur body from a few bones, Alex Haley did the same.  He had nothing more than scant pieces of information from his grandmother about "the African" and he used that to construct the masterpiece "Roots".  After 12 years of research and countless miles of travel Alex Haley had created what can be called a masterpiece.		Everyone knows, at least academically, that slavery existed; and for the most part everyone agrees that it was a horrible thing.  Alex Haley takes you beyond the academic knowledge of slavery.  He goes inside the true nature of that slavery and brings it to life like nothing I've read or seen before.  The book starts with Kunta Kinte and continues with his lineage but Kunta Kinte could just as well be the forefather of any African American that is the descendant of slaves.		The time period of the book was almost too perfect.  It could have quite possibly started with the inception of the American slave trade but I think something vital would have been missing.  If it started at the beginning we would have been privy to a group of unfortunate souls that were all starting in a new land as the first of their kind.  They would have been the ones to establish a slave behavior that would go on to exist for centuries.  But, by the story starting in the 1760's we see the dichotomy between the existing slaves and the newly "acquired" slaves.  There already existed house slaves, field slaves, "mulattoes" and with that the array of personalities with them.  There existed the complete erosion of any sense of self or self worth, the ignorance and loathing of Africa and anything African, the ignorance in general, the deferential behavior towards whites, the despondency, the fear, the endless laws regulating slaves, the firmly ingrained stereotypes, and the other subtle nuances of being a slave.  Alex Haley showed the juxtaposition of a proud young Mandingo who was thrust into a foreign land having to deal with all of the aforementioned and more.		Since the story is about Alex Haley's lineage it progresses from Kunta Kinte through the Revolutionary War, various other wars, slave revolts, the Civil War up until Alex Haley was born in 1921.  Along with the rapturous narration of Alex Haley's family history there were many other historical nuggets woven into the story.  There was mention of different presidents and of course different important Black figures such as Crispus Attucks, Benjamin Banneker, Gabriel Prosser, Phyllis Wheatley, Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and others.  Roots was exactly what I wished all my history books were: a novelized version of history.  An interesting novel with important facts woven into it and not a book of facts and dates with the occasional interesting occurrences.
0,Fantastic Book about the corrupt Federal Reserve.
0,Still a good read and a feel good story.  A good place to start to love Heinlein's stories.  Recommend to young men mostly
0,Adobe's InDesign CS4 is far and away the best text and graphics to print software. It is moving Quark off its well-deserved pinnacle in this category for professional use.		The trouble is, there is so much power with the endless well of commands necessary, it is very difficult to use. And, of course, Adobe continues to avoid really good help for its customers. In this case Adobe Press has joined with Peachpit Press for the 827-page Real World InDesign CS4 by Olav Martin Evers and David Blatner. The only failing -- and it is major -- is the total lack of color which, for a work in this subject, is unforgivable at the $55 price -- less with Amazon but still should have color.		Adobe must find some way to re-categorize their huge and growing encyclopedia of commands for all their software. At the very least they should have the same commands for the same effects in their other fine software. The full design suite should function more fully together even though some elements can be read by InDesign, it can be tricky.		This book is late in arriving. CS4 is likely to be renewed as CS5 fairly soon and, with Adobe, you'll be waiting for the update for commands. But, meanwhile, the best quality of this book measured against others for the same purpose, is being able to find the obscure commands necessary for that skill, trick or set of strokes you need for a book, poster, whatever.		And, for that, the Evers. Blatner work can't be beat.
0,Have you ever read a book that has an event that is so horrible that you have to take a break - back up - even maybe cry with the loss. This 3rd book in the Red Rising series is the best of the 3.  Everyone thinks the Reaper is dead. Why wouldn't they - his execution was public. Nobody is looking for him as the Jackal keeps him locked in a box without light.		Lies and politics go hand in hand. Alliances are made along with tremendous sacrifices. Lives are lost, friendships rekindled, and the war of the colors and for freedom, continues.		I did get this book from my local library
0,You really need to one-click this series now. This is the 10th book in the Trinity Masters series, but also overlaps with the  Admiralty Series. In theory, it could be read as a stand alone book, but it references many things from previous series that could be confusing.		For a general premise, both the American based Trinity Masters and European based Master's Admiralty are behind the scenes movers and shakers in politics, science, art and government. Each has recruits and "legacies" who are children of previous recruits. All are bound in marriage to a trinity for life by the anonymous leader of their group. A recent change for the Trinity Masters is that between when they are bound together, and when they are actually married, they have a mystery of significant importance to solve.		This trinity brings together heirs of the founding fathers - Hamilton, Jefferson and Adams to solve clues left to them by the founding fathers themselves. We found an evil "purist" group inside their ranks sunk a ship with children and priceless art aboard during World War II. The art was saved and slowly sold off on the black market. Only one child of the Master's Admiralty survived. They blame the Trinity Masters and plan to exact their revenge. (All in previous books) The leader of the Trinity Masters has a poem passed down to her through the leadership that suggests, in time of need, there are truths to discover about a wrong done by Europe to America also. She sets Tess Hamilton, a Smithsonian curator, Isaiah "Jefferson" Hayes, a suspense novelist and heir of Jefferson and his slave, and Caden Anderson who was assumed dead and son of a purist trinity - but also descended from the only survivor of the Admiralty's children. They must discover the hidden secrets of the poem, and stay alive while someone else tries to stop them - all while getting to know each other as future spouses. Enjoy this wonderful merge of historical suspense/thriller and romance.

0,REMY was everything we loved about REAL & MINE. We got to see Remy's point of view, how much he felt for Brooke right off the bat, and to see why he struggled with himself. It is much easier to bear the weight of the angst and frustration from his book because we get interruptions from the present (them preparing for their big day) and this helped me keep interested and invested in the story. In REAL when most of these events were unfolding, we got Brooke's inner dialogue and her frustrations that bothered me a bit.		In REMY we get all of the real, raw, ripped, and primal nature of this fighter and how he is like this huge animal trying to protect his family. There is something so visceral and raw about his protective instincts and carnal desire for Brooke that I think would be quite ridiculous on any other hero or other book boyfriend.		Katy Evans writes these characters like a lion and his lioness and it is totally believable. I love how we got events from both of the first books and got to see Racer and the rest of the gang. I am sad to see Remy and Brooke's story ending, but hopefully we will get glimpses of them in the future books. Overall, a great series!

0,Susan Smith is one of those writers that you can be certain is going to produce a really good book This book is no exception there is action romance  humour and parts that had tears come to my eyes and after all that a promise of more to come in the next book.
0,I'm always looking for books that kids can live through vicariously and this is a beautiful one.  Not many city kids will ever get to be on a ranch or for that matter near animals like Rena & Roo.  The photographs make the book come alive for any reader.  FASCINATING!
0,Book 4 of The Elemental Series is another great read. Following the adventures of Larkspur the Elemental on her journey to rescue her father, The King. This story picks up where Book 3 left off and it's non-stop action from the first page.	Lark faces banishment from her home if she continues on her quest. Life is never easy for our heroine but you can expect her to do what is right. Throw in some demons, a Tracker and more elementals and you get a wild ride that can't help but be stormy.		I received this book as an ARC for an honest review, but then I went ahead and bought it because I loved it so much.
0,Despite the obvious and predictable appearance of a rather dastardly villain of the Snidely Whiplash variety, the content of "The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane," a novel by Katherine Howe delivers a potent and sad message that bears extensive thought.		The story, itself, engages with interesting and finely drawn characters that center around the "historical mystery puzzled out by a notable scholar" plot quest that came to mainstream fruition with Dan Brown's "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Da-Vinci-Code/dp/0307474275/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Da Vinci Code</a>" and literary perfection in A.S. Byatt's "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Possession/dp/0679735909/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Possession</a>."  In "Physick--the title refers to an almanac of sorts written by a "witch" or "cunning woman" of the 17th century, in none other than Salem, Massachusetts.  The actual "Physick" is a compilation of time-trusted "instructions" that one would attribute to a witch's grimoire.  Spells to ward off sickness and other maladies are listed along step-by-steps to cultivate other phenomenon perhaps not all in keeping with the religiosity of the Puritan populace of the time of the book's main composition.  Perhaps the volume and its writer are so controversial that the denizens of the late 1600s would consider it such blasphemy it could evidence a discovery of witches and add burning embers to a flame of anger and hatred already fostered by the superstition, boredom, jealousy and hysteria that led to the Salem Witch trials.		Howe's main character, Connie Goodwin possesses good Yankee commonsense combined with scholarship and tenacity. In 1991, she pursues her doctorate in colonial history under the advisement of her mentor Manning Chilton.  When her mother, Grace, definitely a woman whose New Age sensibilities of her 60s heyday drive her more grounded daughter to eye-rolling bouts of frustration, calls from Arizona with a request to look into a property tax snafu on a family dwelling in Marblehead, Connie reluctantly but diligently moves from Cambridge to sort out the paperwork and clean out the cottage.  What she finds there intrigues her from a multitude of levels.  For not only is the house pre-Revolutionary and hidden from plain view by overgrown shrubs and other wildly nurtured vegetation, it is a treasure trove of paraphernalia utilized by the generations of women who lived there.  As Connie accidentally upsets a Bible on a dusty shelf and discovers the name "Deliverance Dane" on a paper folded and tucked into the shaft of a key within the book's pages, a scholarly quest to find the "Physick" ensues that consumes Connie from a historical standpoint but then eventually acts as a portal to a portion of her identity of which she is unaware but sorely needs to uncover.		The actual hunt for the Physick involves wading through old records and library stacks that should appeal to the avid Sherlockian literati especially when shining moments of enlightenment are gleaned as reward.  Connie's education like that of her creator aids her in wielding a mental machete that hacks a path through the darkness of ignorance towards ultimate revelation.		The story falters a bit with the addition of the two-dimensional villain who from the get-go is so insinuatingly obvious as the cause of all things that go wrong for the protagonist that it is almost painful to have to undergo the process that leads to Connie's eventual understanding and ultimate reckoning.		Nonetheless, the true strength in Howe's book is not really the discovery of history, self and confidence--which is, indeed, entertaining in itself--but the insightful comments that the author makes with regard to the nature of women.		In one very poignant portion of the story--the novel does include some "interlude" chapters where the cast from history is focused upon--Deliverance Dane from the vantage point of an imprisoned woman accused of witchcraft by a hysterical group of young girls (made famous in Miller's "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Crucible/dp/0142437336/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Crucible</a>") and women who acted as inspectors looking for so-called "witch marks" on the bodies of the soon-to-be condemned, sadly notes that it is always other women that "leap" to accuse each other and that they pose a danger to each other that somehow did not pose to men.  For whatever reason, the other women in the community throw Deliverance and the other accused under the bus--why?  Is it jealousy?  Ego? Spitefulness?  Whatever the reason, Howe's perspective is that this seems to be the nature of women--a point of fact that hasn't changed and never will. Men gain admittance into the "good-old-boy" society.  There is no such thing for women.  Knives in the back are common and forthcoming.  Howe's prose within the "Interlude" sections is tinged with a realistic melancholy of not being able to trust any woman regardless of one's friendships, confidences, special talents, recognition or acceptance of self.  For anyone traveling the road of individual enlightenment--be it through religion, spiritualism, witchcraft herb lore or sincere intention--beware.  Unfortunately, this is a road best traveled alone without women companions.  Howe tells us that there is no sisterhood of the traveling pants or sorority of the ya-ya sisters--those are just imaginings or wishes.  In the real world, spiteful condemnation is certitude upon which a woman of certain skills can solely rely.  Hopefully, her Connie will heed her words, plow forward keeping her extra curriculums to herself and trusting no one.		Bottom line?  "The Physick of Deliverance Dane" by Katherine Howe entertains from the vantage point of the historical novel whose scholarship is insured by Howe's own scholarship and that of the conundrum obscured by time and unraveled through clever observation, education and intellect.  "Physick" is a novel revolving around witchcraft, the Salem Trials, the finding of self and the world of Harvard doctorate candidates.  On a more important level, it comments with regret upon the nature of women and the oftentimes futility of possessing integrity when the crowd is easily swayed through malicious intent and spiteful jealousy to act against you.  Recommended as a fast read that gives insight beyond the actual paranormal plotline.	Diana Faillace Von Behren	"reneofc"

0,This manual is very extensive.  Its range of topics include survival medicine, to creating emergency shelter in the field, to foretelling weather and how to find direction.  It includes full color images of poisonous snakes and edible as well as poisonous plants to avoid.		While I haven't been in situations that tested virtually most of these methods, as many are geared toward survival in extreme circumstances, I always take this with me when I hike.  I have, however, needed the info on tying knots, have used the pictures to identify snakes, and I often peruse the descriptions of first aid to keep familiar with it.		---*** THE BOTTOM LINE ***---		If you are someone who regularly spends time outdoors, even if it's just a dayhike or camping close to other people, you should really have this book that could help in many situations.
0,I was very lucky to get my hands on this before its release date!	Erin Noelle is an amazing writer. And she proves herself again with this one!	I'm in love with the characters, and the story.	Surviving Us is a MUST read!!
0,I have always loved Sandra Brown books.  I chose this one because I saw the movie first.  I must say this, the book was better than the movie.  What a wonderful read and will keep on reading more books by this author.
0,Sultry jungles (Feehan brings the rain forest alive with her descriptions of the flora and fauna and animals), steamy sex scenes (WOO!  This book is hot, plus you can feel the love and attraction between the two characters.) and hot leopard shifters (who doesn't love a good shifter romance?)  This book started with a novella, The Awakening, that got the ball rolling with the series basics.  Wild Rain was much more in depth and descriptive as it is a full length novel.  I've already ordered the next book in this series.  I've always been a fan of her Dark series and the leopard series does not disappoint.		I won the book Wild Rain from Goodreads in exchange for my honest review.

0,I loved the first Jefferson Tayte story and was really hoping I would love the second book as well. I am glad to say, the second book is just as great as the first book. The story in the story is very depressing, You feel so sad for Mena and you really hope something good happens for her. But as you read the story, you just know it doesn't work out for her. I would recommend anyone whom read the first book, to read the second book as well. I think you well enjoy it as much as you did the first book.
0,Read this book with my son, age 12.  He loved it.  There are not a lot of good 'boy' books (as he calls them) available.  He enjoyed this story.	It is a story full of magic, adventure and fun.  The kids get into some rocky patches along the way, but it adds to the excitement.  The book has a slow start, but I recommend hanging around, it picks up speed and doesn't slow down until the very end.		The two main characters Zoe and Zak are opposites, and they complement each other.  One is a thinker, who takes things slowly and the other rushes into a situation.		Overall, if your child is a fan of Harry or Percy, he/she should enjoy this book.
0,Delilah Dusticle and the Cursed Tempest is a modern-day fairytale featuring a dust fairy and her cleaning company. This time, shes called on to save a town from a terrible curse, but though her dust fighting powers are perfect for the job, she knows she cant use them in the way everyone expects.		I really enjoyed this story. The writing is tight and to the point, while still bringing to mind the vivid imagery that breathes life into a story. Theres a good bit of magic, as would be expected in a fairy tale, but in a modern setting. The characters are also pretty cool and varied in their personalities and quirks: the leather jacket guy (theres a funny picture of him in the book), the lady whos always searching for nearby enemies and threats, and even the grumpy sponge, whose grumpiness is offset by a new bout of orneriness I found delightful.		The illustrations are a bit more abstract than in earlier books, but artistically pleasing and complementary to the story. Near the end (starting chapter 10) the cute little spider is back (the one from the Transylvanian adventure). Id have loved to see more pics of grumpy sponge because hes another of my favorites, but whats there is good.		The only thing that threw me off is that its been a bit too long since Id read the previous book. As a short read, this story doesnt spend much, if any, time reorienting readers to the things leading up to this point. For a little while, I thought I might have missed one of the books as what was mentioned seemed unfamiliar. I later figured out that some was referencing events from the previous story, some was previously unrevealed backstory, and the rest was filling in the time between the last story and this one. On that note, Id recommend reading (or rereading) the previous two stories, plus Eliza Bluebell, before starting this one.		Overall, I thought this was a fun read, both humorous and serious at times with a clever cast of characters and an interesting setting. Id recommend it to folks who like shorter reads, fairy tales, and funny stories. The illustrations are nice, too, though not quite as standalone entertaining as they were in the last book.		I received the review copy of this book from the author.

0,Russell Hoban, Bread and Jam for Frances (Harper Collins, 1964)		The badger is one of the world's most noble creatures. Somehow, when they get rendered in picture books, they always end up desperately cute. Never has this been truer than in Russell Hoban's Frances books. While my only brush with Hoban's writing for older folks was less than auspicious, the Frances books are never less than a joy. In this one, Frances refuses to eat anything but bread and jam, no matter what her parents give her to eat. After a while, they stop giving her anything else, and she realizes that variety is a good thing. Ah, if only it worked that way in real life. A fun one, this. ***

0,The CEB Student Bible makes some curious translations that some with prior exposure to scripture may find jarring. The frequently used title for Jesus, 'Son of Man' is now 'human being' or 'human one'. This gives the text a very different feel, a much earthier Jesus when referring to himself or in an indirect address. Traditionalists or those who disagree with this translation may object on usage of the CEB for this reason alone.		An attractive feature of this bible is the textboxes interspersed throughout the 66 books. These textboxes are written by scholars, seminary professors, and students. They help add clarity to different ideas within the text, particularly those that might challenge modern readers. This idea of highlighting challenging or seemingly contradictory areas of scripture is one that I found very enlightened. Many translations do this via footnote, but the textbox makes it so much more likely a lay person will read it than a footnote which is often in very small type and at the bottom of a page.		Each book contains an introduction with a preface, key themes, and tips for reading. This makes it much like a middle or high school textbook. Have no doubt that this is precisely the demographic the CEB is after in translating and marketing this particular Bible.		Another helpful feature includes 16 full-color maps at the end of the bible. These help illustrate the very foreign places (many which no longer exist) referred to in various books of the Bible. Many students will prefer the NIV for its seeming universality in protestant churches across the English-speaking world. Catholics will continue to prefer the RSV or NAB. Fans of beautiful prose will cling to the King James Version despite its well-known limitations.		Whichever translation best leads you to Christ is the best translation for you. Surely some will find comfort in the readability and modernity of the CEB. I won't be using this as my personal bible, but nor would I rule it out as a resource for young people. 4/5 stars.
0,'When I read a book from this series it's like visiting old friends. A STUNNING end to an EPIC series!' The propensity of each story from this series to make me feel deeply is immense simply because of the history ingrained in my mind and heart. I'm in love with every single character. There are so many layers with so much depth. Their lives are firmly and forever entwined. The Original Sinners Series is a must read for fans of forbidden romance with lashings of BDSM and a love so deep it takes ones breath away.		THE QUEEN begins where The Virgin ends and throughout showcases the past and the present time with flawless writing and seamless transitions. It's about grasping every moment, speaking to others as if they'll be your last words and an abundance of forbidden deep, deep love steeped in kink and taboo. The main players, Nora, Soren and Kingsley, have been together for a period spanning over twenty three years and this series covers much of their history in one way or another.		One tiny twist of fate. I love the deep, thought provoking nuances placed in the prose. Its about destiny, a destiny where there may have been multiple choices and possibilities but all paths would have surely resulted in the same destination. The way The Queen is peppered with earlier memories throughout the telling is engaging and, at times revealing. A couple of chapters left me with an OH-MY-GOODNESS hanging in my thoughts. At times the story gave me goose bumps. The level of Soren's devotion is awe inspiring, especially towards Nora and Kingsley. His selflessness and love evoked tears of emotion from me. His character is complex and intrinsic to the level of intensity felt whilst reading this story.		The manner in which the story arc plays out in THE QUEEN, tying together all aspects of the Original Sinners series, both the Red and White years is just incredible and stunning. Most of the main players whom I've loved throughout the series make an appearance enhancing the story and helping to bring everything full circle with just the right amount of sentimentality and a perfect level of depth and beauty. I LOVED every KINKY, POIGNANT moment.		The Queen depicts Noras transformation into a dominatrix and Queen of the Underground World. She's her normal self, which maybe makes her appear selfish at times but ultimately her behavior is explained with the exploration of why its simply the way it is between Nora and Soren. It explores what could have happened and comes full circle so the reader comprehensively understanding all the whys. Every thought, every question mark Ive experienced is addressed. My many deep conversations with other readers that this series has evoked, especially THE SAINT, have been comprehensively addressed. As a reader, I totally bought into the way the leading protagonists, the people who matter to her, understood her qualities and the lifestyle choices made by them all. Their access-all-area friendships and the dynamic between the main players exude beauty. So many friendships that feel so much deeper than simply just friends. I'm truly happy that I also saw a selfless side to Nora, a side that is borne from love and it was the most beautiful and emotional aspect of this story.		The Original Sinners is a series of epic proportions and The Queen, slated as the last-in-the-series, offers stunning closure. As a forever fan of the series I'll always hope for more! Each story within the series is perfectly crafted with characters, prose and dialogue that are intelligently developed and carry the dynamic of the story forward. Its overflowing with an abundance of meaning and kink wrapped in the most wonderfully epic forbidden love story that has grown in stature with each new release from the series. In turn, with each book I have gained a deeper level of understanding into the lives of the three protagonists and their story. This series will remain a forever favorite and is one I will always HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

0,It's 1962 and there's an important chess tournament in Amsterdam. In the first round Emil Clment has to play against Wilhelm Schweninger. Wilhelm Schweninger is a German who worked for the Ministry of Propaganda during the Second World War. Emil Clment is a survivor of Auschwitz. The Frenchman's life was saved because of playing chess. The two have a mutual history and are linked by Paul Meissner who is also in Amsterdam at the time of the tournament. He thinks they have unfinished business together and he tries to convince Emil to listen to him. Meissner is the person who has made sure Emil's life was spared and they have a story to tell. He's now a priest who tries to do good. The three men keep meeting each other and slowly their history is being revealed.		Emil's name in Auschwitz is The Watchmaker. Because of his repair work he earns himself a couple of privileges which he always shares with a friend. When Meissner introduces chess to improve the morals of the officers in the camp he doesn't know yet that among the Jewish prisoners there's an unbeatable player. To prove that Jews are inferior some of the Germans want him to play chess against their German champions. The stakes are getting higher and higher and Emil is just a pawn in the game, someone who doesn't have a say and who has to play to save his own life and the lives of others.		The Death's Head Chess Club is a story about a Jewish man who was deported to Auschwitz and went through something too terrible for words. Even though Emile manages to keep his life he loses everything else. He loses his family and everything he holds dear. In 1962 he's still a very broken man. I found it unbelievably hard to read about the horrors in the camp, so it took me some time to finish this book as I could only manage a couple of chapters at a time. Of course this isn't the first WWII book I've read, but every time I read about Auschwitz it shocks me to the core. There's a lot of information about the camp itself and about the nauseating things that were being done to the prisoners, especially the Jews. I think there's a good explanation of the hierarchy of the camp which made the story more understandable and which also made it come to life.		I doubted if I would review this book for a very long time. I think John Donoghue has written a very good story and he's definitely a great writer. I had issues with the character of Meissner, who worked in Auschwitz at the end of the war. He's supposed to feel terrible because of the things that happened there and he tries to atone for what he was a part of. I kept feeling conflicted about his character, especially because Emile seems to see him as a friend towards the end of the story. For me that was too quick and also maybe a bridge too far. Because I felt so conflicted and because I didn't like certain aspects, for me this book is also a success. It made me think and it keeps making me think. I try to form an unbiased opinion, but what is the correct way to look at things in this situation? The moral questions that are arising and inner discussions I keep having with myself are turning a really good story into something great. This novel made me contemplate cruelty, the horrors of war, forgiveness, being the better person and plenty of other things. If you're prepared to feel conflicted and to read a good story that will tear you apart inside, then you should pick up this book.

0,This book was well worth the wait.  I love the KGI Series.  Steele went from being a man of few words to silver tongued devil.  I really enjoyed reading as his & Maren's relationship developed.  As always when it comes to Maya Banks, I was not disappointed.  And know I am not so patiently waiting for the next installment in December...finally Donovan's story.		Is someone is looking for great books I highly recommend the KGI Series.  Once I started I could not put them down.
0,This was such a fascinating novel! Imagine being told someone you love most committed suicide. Now, imagine them from the after life trying to make sure you make it through everything. Fabiaschi tells a unique story with I Liked My Life, with every point of view. The hurt of a husband, a teenage daughter was spot on, even the feelings of someone from beyond. Truly amazing. I was fascinated the whole way through.
0,What a beautiful book. My daughter loves this book so much more than the dancing princesses.
0,This is definitely a heartfelt story of sadness and bittersweet joy ending bit. Some of it do happen for real.
0,My second book in the series to read, its also the second book of the Survivors Club series overall. Its got a bit of a different tone than book three that I enjoyed, and the characters stood out in a different light.		I liked that this book had a gentler feel to it than the previous volume I read. Not to say that the fact of Vincents blindness and Sophies dire financial straits aren't heavy and presented with the requisite seriousness and drama. Yet, I think that theres a lighter, gentler romantic air to this one. That was a nice change of pace.		I think a lot of that lighter feel can be chalked up to the characters themselves. Vincent has an attitude that I could only dream of having in a similar situation. He takes his blindness in stride and gets on with his life with a minimum of fuss or drama. There are occasional moments where panic attacks occur, but he meets the challenge in his life with strength of will I can only admire.		Sophie also shined. Life throws a hell of a curve ball her way; if not for Vincent, she would have been in a very drastic situation. Past emotional trauma also makes for a damaged soul. Yet, her heart is big enough to take in Vincent with all his problems as well as her own. I liked that she didn't dwell on her hardship-filled life; she got past it quick and looked at the positive that occurred when fate wove her lifes path with Vincents.		There were occasional forays into eye-rolling clichs. The whole showdown in the dark thing, I felt, was really unnecessary. Yet, unlike book 3, I didn't feel that they weighed down this book. The sweet, sweet romance and the characterizations for our leads more than make up for any clichs that might have occurred.		I adored this installment for the Survivors Club. The romance was tender, and our lead characters strong despite the trauma. Even the odd clich didn't detract from my enjoyment; I still was enthralled by this tender romance. Highly recommended for lovers of this genre.
0,Let's get the obvious out of the way first. Yes, this book ended in a cliff hanger. Yes, it was abrupt. No, I don't really like when that happens. Now on to the good stuff. This is a really good beginning to what I expect to be an amazing series. It was a fast paced, short read for me. It has intrigue, action, and sexiness! The story isn't exactly full of twists and turns, but there were elements that I wasn't expecting. I really want to find out what happens next, so I'll be buying the rest of these books.
0,...This book is, in my view, in a tie with the first Dune book for first place.	It is an entirely new universe since the death of the Tyrant Leto II. The lost children are returning from the Scattering and the Famine Times, and humanity is slowly waking up again....	There is a newness to this volume; there is action; there is great science fiction; there are fantastic plot and character developments; and last, but not least, there are many twists and turns followed by a spellbinding finale - thus, a fabulous sequel to a most challenging and "non-action"-oriented Book4. You will remember why you love the Dune worlds and their author, and thereby will be prepared for the Grand Mother of all Dune books, Chapterhouse:Dune (6), which I have reviewed elsewhere.	Cheers!
0,I loved being inside Buck's head as his dog-thoughts were flashed across the pages mirroring the movements of the sled.
0,F..ing brilliant. Maybe visa versa but you'd need to read it through to judge that. And that won't take you long because it's tight little chapters are easy to take, but will have you twisting with the plot so frequently....well. as long as I could suspend my disbelief....it was a kick.  Still I'll wait for Netflix to see the movie.
0,I like all of Stone Barrington Novels.  Roger
0,Okay, so lets start with my love affair with dragons. Sure, werewolves and vamps are super cool and all, but dragons are just epic. Majestic. I had been thinking I needed more dragon shifters in my life when this book came through from Dreasmpinner and I was all over it. Then...well, then the author wrote the scene I wish for in every dragon book Ive ever picked up and it was perfect. But, okay, lets go back to the start so I can articulate this review.		Warwick is a bit of a loan dragon <see what I did there?>. Shifters of all types go to him when finances are tight and hes not surprised when Alpha Montgomery comes to him for money. The amount is apparently staggering and Warwicks terms are appropriately stiff. Pay it back or he takes the pack lands as collateral. When the debt comes due, the Alpha hasn't paid back a cent and Warwick has come to collect with little care that hes crashing Montgomerys sons birthday.		As an Omega, Avery has been relegated to useless in the pack. His birthday party should be a celebration, but the sense that hes in a room full of would-be suitors, some of whom aren't subtle, leave him less than enthused. He escapes for air when Warwick arrives and is drawn back by a pull he cannot name. Warwick, intent on collecting his due, feels it as well and is only marginally better at not showing his hand. Marginally because when he makes his move, he gives up the money and the pack lands in lieu of Avery and three businesses.		At that point, I had no use for Alpha Montgomery at all. The true mate pull doesnt excuse a father willing to hand over a child to cover his own mistakes, especially because he didn't know that was happening, So, yeah, not a fan, and I was happy the focus shifted to Avery and Warwick trying to figure out what they are together. Theres some miscommunications that were..contrived?...the scene in the restaurant left me wanting...but for the most part they were cute together. Then Warwick shifted and let Avery ride him and all those little bits of eh disappeared. Everything about that scene made the book for me and had there been as much descriptive showing in the rest of the story, this would have been a 5 star read all day.		If you're a shifter fan, a dragon fan, a fan of low-angst insta-romances...you won't be disappointed at all.

0,feminists and fans of strong fiction	Review how can you ever really know the truth about another person? We all write our own narratives about the people we know and love		Billie Flanagan is living the good life in Northern California. Her husband, Jonathan, has a lucrative career that permits her to stay home, even though Olive is now in middle school. But one day she heads out on one of her favorite hiking trails, the Pacific Crest Trail in Desolation Wilderness, and she never returns. Search and Rescue crews find a single hiking boot and a cell phone far below the trail with its screen smashed. Her bank cards and checking remain untouched. Jonathan and Olive are forced to face the truth: Billie is never coming home again. They hold the funeral, and a year later, Jonathan sits down to write a memoir of his life with Billie. It is here that we join the family.		Many thanks go to Net Galley and Random House for the invitation to read and review in exchange for this honest review. The book will be available to the public July 11, 2107.		This psychological thriller starts with daughter Olive, who is in middle school, seldom a proud or happy time for any of us. But one day Billie appears to Olive in the hallway and tells her that she should be looking harder; she isn't trying. Olive is convinced that her mother is still alive and trying to reach her. Eventually Jonathan starts to wonder as well. Neither of them is able to move on effectively without knowing the truth, yet there it is: they have no body and they have no proof of anything. As their journeys unfold, both externally and internally, Brown develops the hell out of both of these characters and through the memories both evoke in word and thought, she develops Billie best of all. An interesting side character named Harmony rounds things out nicely.		As each layer of each character is revealedI was planning to say its like having three sets of Russian nesting dolls, but thats not right; each has many more layers than that, more like onions--the readers viewpoint is forced to shift from one point of view to another, and so we wonder at various times about alternate possibilities. Could Billie really be alive somewhere? Did she just up and leave them? Shes done that before. She is a runner. She has been known to drop people with no warning at all, just ghost them. It was a long time ago, but its true.		Or is she dead at the hands ofhmm, the ex-boyfriend that surfaces at the funeral? And we wonder whether maybe Jonathan, whose memories of Billie are not all as rosy as the ones we hear at the outset, did something to harm her. And then we wonder about Billies friend Harmony, who moves into Jonathans life rapidly enough to disturb Olive considerably. Shes so needy, so hungry for his attention; would she have offed Billie in order to have a crack at him? Many of these ideas are merely hinted at rather than voiced by the narrative, and this is part of what makes it so tasty. At first, I think my idea is original because I am so smart, but then I look back, as a reviewer has to do, and I can see its not really about my being smart (darn), but rather about very subtle foreshadowing. Brown uses lights and mirrors to get our minds moving in different directions, and the disorientation is, in its own twisted way, part of the rush.		A last note goes to the tangential but rarely-seen moment when a character muses about why its so hard to find an abortion clinic when you need one. This is the reverse side of a pet peeve of mine, the commonly used notion that every accidental pregnancy necessarily must end in childbirth, as if the year were 1950 or 1960 rather than the 21st century. I wonder whether Brown had to fight to keep that reference in her novel? One way or the other, this was going to be a five star review, but when I found that courageous little nugget, I wanted to shout for joy!		As to the endI cant tell you what happens of course, but I will tell you that this doesnt end ambiguously. By the conclusion, the reader knows what happened to Billie.		When all is said and done, this is fiction that every feminist can embrace. If there is a heaven, Charlotte Perkins Gilman is looking down, and she is cheering.
0,There is some pretty kinky stuff happening at the casino these days.  But who can resist a hot guy in a uniform?  I do not blame this girl for wanting more from life, and wanting the security guard, who wouldn't?  I loved the way this story came together.  A lot of this story I can imagine actually happening, and so much was unexpected.  The romance is a real sizzler.  It is a great read, I am looking forward to more True Desires.
0,This is a very short book that has easy to digest, useful information.  The individual chapter authors should be good resources.
0,Kenyon sees Christ as seated on the Throne of David, not an infant in a manger, not a figure on the Cross, not a resurrected good man, but the Divine Son of God, seated in authority at the right hand of God as the Zeal of the Lord makes His enemies his footstool.  Kenyon also demands that Christians think.  If you do not want to THINK, I recommend that you avoid him and take an easier route.  He will challenge you to read your Bible and DO what it says.  E.W. Kenyon helped train Kenneth E. Hagin [according to Hagin], whose ministry influenced Kenneth and Gloria Copeland.  In my opinion, Kenyon's writing is not for insincere faith.
0,Excellent book. Well written and breath taking information. More than what expected from the book.

0,The first recorded attempt to escape Goas occurred in 1930 when a farmer failed to trade the land for a lusher parcel. He established a precedent for the next sixty years: a great urge to leave, matched only by total practical impossibility.		Upon his death, he bequeathed the farm to the Roman Catholic Church. The diocese, not knowing what to do with an unprofitable farm, established a school.		Into this desolation enters Larry Kaplansk. (Kaplansk had an "i" on the end until Principal Tuyeni removed it on the day that Larry arrived.) He comes to teach English and History.		Mavala Shikongo immediately catches the eyes of the male staff at Goas but her past as a revolutionary soldier and rumors of a bright hope for her future create a distance. She is gone as quickly as she came in three short weeks.		When Mavala comes again, things are different. This time she has a young son in tow and she plans to settle at the school.		Kaplansk and Mavala begin secret rendezvous in a nearby cemetery. Upon the graves they build a relationship of mutual personal destruction. Their passion for one another launches them down a spiral of despair.		But Mavala may be more than Kaplansk's condemnation. She may be his savior and his only escape from Goas.		Set in the early 1990s, soon after Namibia won independence from South Africa, the novel is mostly narrated by Kaplansk but sometimes tells the story from other character's perspectives. Peter Orner's debut novel is presented in episodic chapters, often just a few paragraphs long.		It may give a first impression as just another artsy piece of literary clap-trap but Orner knows exactly what he's doing. The Second Coming of Mavala Shikongo proves to be written with force, style and wit.
0,Randi did it again! I have been waiting for Stolas ever since Randi told us about it and this book does not disappoint! Stolas is definitely my new book boyfriend! I can't wait to see what is next with this series!
0,I enjoyed this book and the spiritual aspects. Will look for more by the author.  I would recommend this to others.
0,Fast moving and unexpected events....Constitution Book 1 was a great impossible to put down sci fi thriller!  I only write reviews when a book is exceptional and/or I want the next book in the series to come out.  In this case "Constitution" meets both criteria!
0,"The personality of the dead person was usually much more interesting than the personality of the murderer."		  Straight up whodunnit inside an English Catholic monastery.  Shows its role in society as a alternative for men who though somewhat scary aren't mean enough to want to imprison.  Kinky and funny enough to keep the pages flying.
0,This is the first book I read of hers. It was a wonderful story. I couldn't put the book down. I will be reading all of her stories in the future. I am going to put her on my must read list. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.
0,Great book. A little predictable but very sexy and romantic.
0,Using written accounts of the passengers, both survivors and not, the author weaves a beautiful story. A wonderful glimpse into the world of 1915.
0,I got this book from the library in the science fiction section, but I would classify it as fantasy instead.  I couldn't put it down, I enjoyed the characters, the story, and the spirituality.  Great stuff!		This book may challenge your world view, so readers that cannot approach a differing world view with an open mind would be advised to avoid it.		The 'new age' sprituality is introduced at a light pace, and fits seemlessly with the story.  As a contrast, The Celestine Prophesy series tended to bog down for me in this respect.		To readers that enjoyed this book, I would also recommend 'Religion Wars' by Scott Adams.		Entertainment: 5 stars	Enlightenment: 5 stars	Overall: 5 stars
0,Enjoying it.
0,Engaging for me and for younger kids; great to get conversations going about certain temptations and obstacles; good detail, but not too much in biographies, yet we can delve deeper into the ones we want after interest is raised by this book.  I re-created the map from the endpages onto a pair of full length curtains and decorated the walls in the boys' room with dragons and a "dragon slayer" knight.  I wish there were more resources to go along with this. I printed coloring pages of dragons and knights to go along with it, however.
0,Take a break from the hustle and bustle of traditional baking, Christmas shopping, and full holiday schedules to savor the true meaning of Christmas with one or more emotionally engaging devotions compiled by Kathy Ide for  21 Days of Christmas. Their story-style format celebrates the season with twenty-one devotions that capture meaningful struggles and situations common to us all.		One of my favorites was "Star Light, Star Bright" from Kathy Ide. Her unusual portrayal of Joseph from a first person perspective added a dimension to Joseph I'd missed in the familiar Christmas story. Her devotion brought into focus what Joseph must have felt at being chosen to be the earthly father to God's own Son.		Then there's Nanette Thorsen-Snipes devotion, "Doubting Thomas" about a little girl's faith, the impact of divorce, money problems and the power of prayer. Or Washington State author Jan Cline's devotion "The Box," a story wrapped in surprises, fruit cakes, mysterious presents and the true meaning of gifts. Devotions conclude with a "Life Application" segment and brief author bio.		The purse-sized devotional fits nicely into purse or bag for coffee breaks or other spare minutes with readings that highlight the importance of family, traditions, and celebrations, yet emphasize Jesus is the reason for the seasonan attitude often lost in our increasingly secularized society.		Kathy encourages readers who feel moved or blessed by the stories to share their experiences with others at www. FictionDevo.com, and read what others have shared. If a more casual setting is preferred, visit FaceBook.com/FictionDevo to share your thoughts.	I suspect Kathy's new series is destined to become a best seller because of the variety of authors and well-written stories that celebrate God, His grace, His love, and Christ's gift of salvation. This devotion series is designed for readers who already enjoy Christian fiction; however, the books are an excellent gift choice to introduce those who haven't yet discovered the value of Christian fiction.	Future books in this series include 21 Days of Love (January 2016), and 21 Days of Joy (April 2016).		21 Days of Christmas, Stories that Celebrate Gods Greatest Gift, Compiled by Kathy  Ide, Broadstreet Publishing, 2015, 160 Pages, 978-1424550517, $14.99		Midwest Book Reviews: Gail's Bookshelf November 2015	Pinterest: GailWelborn	Twitter: @GailWelborn	FaceBook: Gail Welborn

0,Loved, loved, loved this book.  If you are a fan of Laura Frantz you will so very much enjoy it!!		Tamsen is at a crossroads in her life.		So is Jesse, whether he knows it or not.		This is a great novel on love, danger, and what God can do to bring two people together.		LOVED it!! I so did not want it to end.  If you enjoyed Courting Morrow Little by Laura Frantz you will love this one.  I will be buying Lori Benton's other book as soon as I possibly can!
0,Paulson's work is so outstanding.  Great books for children, even better to read to them!
0,Great book, very informative, very well arranged, topic wise;It's on point with many topics, easy to understand, clear, and very thorough in research, up to date.
0,Like so many others here I cannot say enough about this wonderful book. I have read extensively on the topic of WW2 but the Italian story is often a footnote in history. I could tell just from the brutal honesty of the author in the Preface that this would likely be a special book but I really had no idea how special it would be to me.		It is hands down one of the finest books I have read in a very long time. Pino Lella was a genuine hero. Whether it was just circumstance or his own desire to become such a person is beyond me but, however it came to be, there are whole families that are alive today because of his heroics as a young man. In so many ways it seems that his heroics couldn't help him avoid the tragedy of war that was brought upon him personally.		The story of Pino Lella has finally been told. Please take the time to read it. I assure you that you won't be disappointed that you did.
0,This story is a science fiction dystopia. It features a corrupt earth government, Skyships of rebels, and aliens. In this future when the United States has been devastated by something and retaliated by nuking any perceived enemies, surface dwellers are divided into fringers and the residents of some protected cities. These cities are powered by pearls that fall from the sky and have enough energy to keep the cities going.		The main characters are Jesse Fisher who has been raised on one of the skyships and is supposed to be training as one of the agents who are spies and soldiers. He's more interested in going to one of the other cities as soon as he turns eighteen. The other main character is Cassius Stevenson who has been raised on Earth under the control of the mysterious Madame who goal is to bring down the skyships.		The boys first meet on earth in one of the abandoned cities when both are looking for a fallen pearl. When they touch each other something strange happens to each of them. Jesse develops the ability to call the pearls to him and to cause them to explode. Cassius gains the ability to explode spewing fire all around him. Cassius has no control over this ability but Madame says that she has the cure if only he goes to skyship academy and brings her Jesse.		Jesse has plans of his own and wants to get to Seattle to find out about his mysterious past. This story is filled with action as both boys find themselves on Earth and making their way to Seattle. This is the first book in a series. I'll be reading more to find out more about Jesse and Cassius.
0,This is really helping me through the holidays!
0,Great book. Little girls always love this story
0,As I say with any book of Gary Thomas', he's written the best book I've read on several subjects, including this one.		I was enriched by "Sacred Search" at the absolutely perfect season. I was mostly revived from the heartbreak of losing my first marriage and wondering whether it was possible to blunder less the second time around. While this book seems directed to young folks coming to marriage the first time, it helped me understand the mechanics of my first marriage's failure and what really mattered in finding a better match the second time around.		Let me emphasize how important this book is, even if you're already married. My first marriage involved two very good people who sincerely wanted to do what God wanted. It ended in total frustration, with one person out of the faith and the other involuntarily dismissed. Had we had this template for understanding ourselves and each other, I would like to think we could have negotiated our challenges with understanding and greater acceptance.		When you read through this with someone with whom you're getting serious (each with their own copy to mark up), it facilitates the conversation. It will not let you leave the hard questions unasked.		Don't be put off by the somewhat unromantic tone with which the book begins (the outgrowth of his extensive counseling with troubled couples.) "Sacred Search" is very rich and inspiring. So much good counsel beyond marriage, too. "It's not just about what we do for God; it's about who we become in God. When I keep relating to God, I literally become a different person, so there's always someone new for my wife to get to know. The same is true for me with her" (p. 175). So much information about laying a foundation for a marriage that stays fresh and vital.

0,Can't wait for Hard line to cone out to see what happens next. I've read the whole series in less than a week. Wish I could start the next book now!
0,This book gets better and better as it goes. There's plenty of action and much more magic than in his other books. The deviant nature of evil is explored in shocking ways that I never would have expected--something Goodkind always excels at. I enjoyed this book more than the first Nicci book, but I can't figure out how to explain why, without major spoilers. The ending is exciting and satisfying, while still leaving me hooked, craving the next book in that delicious way that only a great series can. I loved it!
0,This was a good read I can't wait to read the others. This team are always in my top ten of favs. Good read.
0,The print is very small and the book was dedicated to a person even though it was so-called new. The King James Version of the bible is very easily understandable and the Catholic Church (for some reason forbade this a while ago but it is now allowed)by the Vatican.	In the public schools in 1950, the psalm of King David: psalm 23 was said every morning when I was in the second grade at school. I was 7.	It is really short but very beautiful . Some so-called loving ?? over tolerant??? woman in Florida in 1952 made a law and abolished all saying of prayers in the schools ,biblical or otherwise, even though, at that time, the one and only God (the triune God) was worshipped all across the United States! Insidiously, and with the advent of the wonderful television set overtaking people's minds, this idea did not worry our passive brains which absorbed so much advertisements for soap and asperine that another idea for learning more mathematics and competing  with non- TV  Russia was appealing,  but, abolishing God from the scene seemed like the logical thing to do GOD  took too much instruction.time . . . so. . . in the name of FREEDOM . . . (freedom meaning license not, freedom with responsiblity). . .  TV , in itself , was an additional informative source, even though it has been known that books are better for the brain and TV eliminates some important thinking processes. (Abraham Lincoln was a poor man from the back woods of Kentucky but he owned (his family owned) the Bible and they actually read it! and he is considered a great president. There are many really exciting dramas in the Old Testament and after 2000 years, it is still considered a best seller ! and sits on a book shelf in some homes. (unopened) . Guttenburg in 1492 published the first Holy Bible in Germany and there are so many wonderful proverbs and stories in it . . . that we do not need either the "Qu'ran" or "Mao's little red book" or "Mein Kampf" . . . at least the bible should head up the library list for everyone. Confusius is often given credit for the sayings of Jesus Christ !. . . this is so annoying . Will a generation of those who communicate in SMS all their childhood and youth be able to read the Bible ? . . . We do not need an evangelist or a priests for very much today; in former times most people could not read before the printing press came out, but, which is why, Martin Luther, an Augustinian Catholic Monk had to copy many sections of the hand written huge bible chained to a pillar in the church in order to read it properly . He was a brilliant scholar and saw how many lies were being circulated by the intellectuals of the time to the analfabetic populace! It is good if they really instruct people on the stories and how to use the bibles on the shelves at home. . . when we can read the Bible, however, instruction as to how the bible came about and the words that are difficult need instruction, but , how can we get that if it is NOT PERMITTED or ALLOWED to be taught at public schools. No wonder there are so many "private" schools and home -schooling ! The bible  is our guide on how to behave. Sure, some hateful people use it as a weapon instead of a guide. Like all neutral things have good and bad potential. My "nail- clippers" were confiscated on a trip from Holland to the USA, right after "9/11" like I was going to run into the cock-pit and clip or injure some part of the pilot. . . .yet, we ate a meal on the plane with sharp plastic forks. . . ? Absurd ?
0,A fun and quick read.	A slight twist to the time travel plot makes the story interesting. Our "far from perfect " main character keeps it light hearted. Wait. What?	Don't bother trying to attach "rules". Time travel is 'timey wimey ', as a great man once said. Go with it!
0,It is great to discover new royals and read about their influence on one of the most powerful royal houses and English rulers. Henry VIIIs many wives and mistresses are well documented but these three women had an impact on the Tudor house that Soberton is celebrating beautifully in this book.
0,I didn't expect to like this series with the first few chapters and I got totally hooked! Really enjoyed them! I couldn't wait to read all three!

A copy of this book was provided to me with no requirements for a review. I voluntarily read this book and my comments here are my honest opinion.
0,When this was published, shortly before 9/11, bio attacks was little on people's minds. The anthrax letter attacks quickly changed that. Yet, 13 years later, after much expenditure and awareness, people have forgotten the danger, know little of the history, and preparedness is questionable. We still have trouble reacting to major disasters, people still panic at the littlest disruption. And people still live under the illusion the government would never experiment on them. The dangers of bioweapons are well-known (we created many of them), and yet the government busies itself with spending money on waste and buying votes, while the borders are open and we have seen a resurgence of diseases because of it (natural germ warfare is just as much of a danger, just look at ebola spreading across Africa).

0,There aren't any words in this.  It is just coloring, but from the pictures you can kind of figure out that what she's wearing might not be appropriate and you can talk about it.  Then the next page will be some ideas for her and then there will be a picture of the same girl wearing something more flattering and modest, yet in style.  My fashionable 7 year old is appreciating this coloring book and we've already had many conversations about what is or isn't okay for her to wear.  She tends to like things that are too small for her because her favorite clothes are the ones that she will eventually grow out of!  Anyway, this is sweet and a cute little size and great for fashion loving people.  It's thought provoking but not pushy in it's opinions.
0,I was previously unaware of any David Bishop offering. I am very glad I found this terrific book with many great characters. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting an enjoyable read with an interesting plot plus well developed protagonists. Enjoy.

0,Prez Reverte, Arturo.  El Puente de los Asesinos (Mexico DF: Alfaguara: 2011), Las aventuras del Capitn Alatriste.		This is my favorite author in the field of Spanish language historical fiction.  I've bought and read nearly all of his works most of which feature Capitn Alatriste, a former soldier in the Spanish king's endless imperial wars against the Protestant countries of the north in the early 1600s, now turned into a blade for hire.  The powerful men who hire him and his young understudy, igo Balboa, the narrator, are for the most part corrupt courtiers if not just venal men of power.	Perez Reverte employs the adventures of this aging, expert warrior-assassin, a good-hearted and sharply disciplined bachelor, as a stand in for the Spanish people ruled by short-sighted, conservative, often egotistic men, including the king and his advisers.  Historically speaking, the capitn and his assistant are said to have lived during Spain's accelerated decline from the heights of the most powerful nation in Europe. The author is motivated by telling the world the details of this fascinating national downfall.		In this story, Alatriste (literally sad wing or fallen crest) is hired to help launch a coup d'etat against the ruler of Venice, then an independent merchant-trading republic.  The attempt, based out of the Spanish colonial enclaves of Milan and Naples, includes the assassination of the Dogo, the Venetian king.  The reader is treated to a detailed description of the local political system, important public buildings, and relevant neighborhoods of the city of canals.  The capitn, igo, and other Spanish soldiers are betrayed at the last minute, possibly by Spanish officials, and only a handful of them survive and are able to escape including the capitn and his assistant.  [March 2012]
0,I can't believe it took me this long to get around to this book.  It is honestly the best book I ever read.
0,Well-written, interesting, believable characters and a plot that moves along make this book a stand-out. Open and Shut is a legal mystery, with a healthy dash of humor via the smart aleck personality of lawyer and lead character Andy Carpenter. Carpenter's inner dialogue is irresistible and I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. It's always a pleasure to find a new author with a large book list, and I've already started on the second book in the series. I'm looking forward to many more good reads!
0,I applaud this book and Boston's informed insights into the issues of gun laws, patriotism, government, and firearms.		I found his analysis to be complete and fair (his bias for specific products is evident, but at least he admits them.)		I think he is dead on accurate when talking about personal liberty, being responsible for your own protection, and items that almost no one owns yet everyone *should* own.	.	I would have liked to have seen a chapter on "gun privacy." And privacy issues in general when dealing with weapon and ammunition purchases.  However, I can see how privacy issues would take an entire book of its own (He has written a great privacy book as well, with an updated version hopefully coming out in 2007.)		Privacy is even more important in this day and age where the Patriot Act has unknown numbers of three-letter agencies just looking for people to buy guns, ammo, special literature, etc.		I previously had an issue with what appeared to me as Boston telling people selling guns at gun shows to get drivers license information of the buyer (Section 28/4).  However, after emailing Boston I finally got my facts straight.		EDIT (July 20th) :: I emailed Boston and he informed me (paraphrasing) "...that most gun show private sales will not request ID from buyers.  In section 28/4 he was just telling people to protect themselves when SELLING there own firearms that have already been papered in their own names."		That makes sense to me...  If you have already papered a gun to yourself, then it makes sense to cover yourself if you sell that gun.		With that straightened out, I can now increase my review to 5 stars. (if the above EDIT would let me change my rating).		Excellent book!
0,Mary gets a phone call from a college friend which sends her off on her next case. Ronnie Beaconsfield Fitzwarren is concerned about her Aunt Vivian who has disappeared. Vivian has spent years in and out of asylums, most recently Bedlam for a series of mental health issues. Mary met her once when she accompanied Ronnie and her new baby son to Bedlam to show him off to her aunt.		Apparently, she and a nurse got a weekend pass to visit her older brother Edward, Marquess of Selwick, on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday. She disappeared along with jewels she inherited from her mother and a few other trinkets from the family safe. She had a pretty good head start since she left before the birthday celebration and wasn't noted as missing until she didn't return to Bedlam some days later.		Mary goes down to Selwick to investigate and get a better picture of Lady Vivian than her one meeting afforded her. She meets the Marquess and takes an immediate dislike to him as he is a rather unintelligent misogynist in love with his own opinions and the sounds of his own voice and who has taken a strong interest in Benito Mussolini who is bringing fascism to Italy. Her other interviews with staff who remembered her don't really give her any clues to where she might be.		Meanwhile, Holmes has been looking for Lady Vivian in London including checking jewelers and pawn shops which might have received her jewelry. Mary decides she needs to check Lady Vivian's medical files at Bedlam and manages to get herself committed - briefly. Speaking with other inmates and checking Lady Vivian's files leads her to think that she might have gone to Venice.		Holmes was all set to let her go to Venice alone until Mycroft drafts him to go along and look into the fascists who are gaining control there. Together and separately, Russell and Holmes investigate with Holmes becoming an acquaintance of Cole Porter and his wife and Russell becoming part of Elsa Maxwell's Lido set.		Secrets are discovered and the two cases come together. Along the way, the reader sees what Venice was like in 1925, what is was like to be a woman at that time, what the social and sexual mores were, and what fascism was doing to Italy. The clever conclusion allows right to triumph and villains to get their well-earned comeuppance. This was another wonderful entry into a long-running series.
0,Sweet, heartfelt, sexy, and wonderfully funny, The Bed Mate by Kendall Ryan will make you swoon, sigh, sniffle, and BEG for more fun and sexy romances! This is one of those books you find yourself losing track of time and where your at because you just get...SOOOO into it. The characters have a rich background and are wonderful and full of life and depth. I loved how easy it was to go from friends to lovers. There was a constant buzz of chemistry between hero and heroine that was utterly charming and SO SO HOT!		I have loved all these Room Mate stories. They are so much fun and have a great amount of humor, heat and heart. But The Bed Mate...mmmm...even BETTER! Its a bit more fast paced but damn..its sexy as all get out! I loved every bit of this story. It made me laugh and made me need  a cold shower a time or two..ok maybe three.  You can't get more sexier and more fun than The Bed Mate.		The Bed Mate gets a FUN AND SUPER HOT HOT HOT FIVE SHOOTING STARS!
0,*ARC provided for an honest review* Drowning Erin is a full length, stand-alone romance novel. This was my first read by author Elizabeth O'Roark. Drowning Erin is about two characters who have known each other for years and the story goes between the past and present with alternating POV's. Erin is so convinced that she knows that a certain kind of life will make her happy that she, in turn, makes herself miserable trying to fit into that mold. Brendan, on the other hand, appears to be living his dream but is buried with guilt from a past relationship. If you love angst this is the story for you! The story and characters sucked me in and I seriously could not put the book down - it gave me all the feels! I cannot wait to see what the author has in store next~
0,Unlike most of Mr. Gorey's more macabre fare, this is truly a children's book of delightful images of Halloween.  The book is actually two books in one with "A Halloween Treat" on the front side and "Edward Gorey's Ghosts" starting from the back cover when you flip the book over. In the Halloween Treat half, each page has one of the letters that make up the word Halloween on the bottom corner and alternates between children with Candy Corn masks, cats in costume (like the front cover image) or 2 other small children out trick or treating who keep expecting jelly beans and get something Gorey-esque instead.  Simple text captions for the illustrations are easy for children to follow/read.  The "Edward Gorey Ghosts" section has images of ghosts ranging from humorous to slightly spooky, in different settings with no text, takes up a little more than half the book, but again, delightful drawings worthy of showing the smallest tyke with no cause for fear (either yours or theirs :)  A truly lovely Halloween Treat and suitable gift for all ages, whether you are a Gorey fan or not!

0,**Note: There are no spoilers for this book, but are slight spoilers for previous books in the series.		This is book three in the Eternal Mates series. Vail is our severally tortured hero of this story.  We met him in book one where he had spent thousands of years under the control of an evil witch and was forced to be at war with his brother and the rest of the elves.  This witch had tortured him and left him without much of his sanity.  Needless to say, he doesn't have much use for witches now that he has finally escaped her clutches.		Our heroine was introduced in book two.  Rosalind is a witch and a bit of a hermit.  She especially avoids elves.  It was foretold that she would die at the hands of an elf, so she has refused to spend any time around any elves to make sure she doesn't meet up with the specific elf that is supposed to kill her.  Fate has something different in mind for both our hero and heroine.		When they are both captured and held together in a prison and Rosalind is forced to heal Vail, she has no choice but to be around the elf as he is forced to be around the witch.  Their time in the prison, which would be enough on its own, is made much more difficult as they both deal with their hatred of the other species.		Rosalind and Vail are fated mates, so they feel a connection from the start.  However, Vail doesn't take to this very well.  The evil witch trapped him by convincing him that she was his fated mate.  So when Rosalind shows up as his actual mate, Vail instantly feels it is another trick.  As they work together to escape the prison, along with the help of an incubi, we see their relationship bloom and the mistrust between them dissipate.		This was the darkest story in series so far.  Since I like dark stories and tortured heroes or heroines, this was a great story for me.  I love the look into Vail's head.  Heaton does a great job portraying his forays into and out of his bouts of madness.  The worldbuilding is just as good as the previous books, which is wonderful.  She really does a great job with the descriptions to make you feel like you are actually their.		The cast of characters in this book is really small.  For the most part, the story is just Vail and Rosalind, along with the incubi that was also imprisoned with them.  I'm a big fan of secondary characters. They can make or break a story for me.  However, the lack of secondary characters in this book didn't make the story suffer at all.  Vail is such a complex character, he  and Rosalind were able to hold your attention without the extra characters in the story.		**Book was provided to me by the author. This review is my opinion and was not requested or provoked in anyway by the author.
0,Overall a good book although it sort of loses its way towards the ending.  Good for anyone that has ever taken a yoga class.
0,I never knew this side of the great actor George C. Scott. Didn't know the madness and addiction. The woman who loved him her whole life told his story beautifully. It was obvious she loved him very much.
0,Holy smokes. I was not mentally prepared for this book. I don't know that anyone will be. I loved how dark and intense this book was. Seriously kept me reading kept me wondering about the characters. The pacing was flawless this is like Fallen Crest only much darker. Think Amo Jones type dark, or Celia Aaron type dark. I don't know where this author has been hiding all my life but she has a forever fan in me.
0,Wonderful boo! Gift for a friend.
0,Perfect coloring book for your Star Wars enthusiast!
0,Delightful fantasy that engages the reader immediately. Couldn't put it down until I finished it. Bought a copy for my grandson to read and explore in preparation for a trip to Biltmore this summer. Cant wait to see where Serafina spent her days and nights.
0,Excellent follow up book to totaled !!!  So sad that the series is over!!!  Drew and Bree are addictive!!  Would love for it to continue and maybe explore more with them and expand into Bree's BFF Sue meeting someone  would love to see more of Liam and what's in store for everyone !!!  Great job Stacey!!!
0,As a Sergeant in the 89th Infantry Division under Patton, I found it fascinating to see what Patton's troops did from the point of view of the "upper echelons".
0,This book took my breath away.  The writing is fabulous and the story is compelling.  I give praise to Jason Luke and hope to read more of his books in the near future!
0,Reviewed by Joe Graham for Reader Views (1/07)		Most of us have visited nursing homes and have been sad and depressed at the frail, unhappy people that we have seen there. We feel bad for the people who are in the home whether they are friends or family and we hope that a similar fate will not be part of our future.  Thomas, in "In the Arms of Elders," attempts to change the way we think about the elderly with what he calls "A Parable of Wise Leadership and Community Building."		The book tells the fictional story of a young couple, medical professionals, Bill and Jude who think they have all the answers about how to deal with the elderly. On a vacation, they are shipwrecked on a mysterious island named Kallimos, and they are forced to rethink the way they think about the elderly. With wise council and stories, two of the elder residents of the island, Hannah and Haleigh help Bill and Jude adjust to life on Kallimos.		In her first lesson, Hannah teaches them that the three plagues of the elderly are loneliness, helplessness and boredom.  Does that sound very much like the atmosphere of most nursing homes?  Then Hannah goes on to teach them that "Elders exist because they show us how to make a community. As we give to them, they give to us their wisdom, their experience, their affection. When we come together to meet their needs, we learn how to live as human beings."		After a year on the island, Bill and Jude are washed back into their life in the Other World and at this point the parable ends and Thomas talks about the changes that can and should be made in nursing homes. With his wife, he has created a different kind of world for people living in nursing homes called The Eden Alternative.  His Eden Alternative philosophy is currently in practice in every state in the U.S. and all over the world.  The Green House, another project of the author is a new way of looking at elderly care and it "is inspired by the richness of close personal relationships and the healing power of community."		I would recommend the book to anyone who thinks that there must be something better than most nursing homes that run rampant with the three plagues of loneliness, helplessness and boredom.  Thomas gives the reader a great deal to consider but he does it in a very loving, comforting way. After reading the book, most readers will be curious to find out more about the Eden Alternative and The Green House and the author provides a list of contact information and web sites.		Thomas and his wife are in the forefront of a movement to change the face of elder care as we currently know it and hopefully the changes will be in place as the baby boom generation finds itself in need of that care. We can only hope that the love and respect for elders and for keeping them a vital part of the community that Thomas espouses in "In the Arms of Elders" will be the norm in  elder care in the years to come.		Received book free of charge.
0,Read it in one day. Gripping and keeps the pages turning. Great plot and character development. You won't be sorry.
0,Once again the Cast women have done it again. This book was excellent and I'd recommend it pulls you in to the story right away. I am so glad I read this
0,This was such a good book! I loved Riley and felt for her. I was ready to tell the town's people off, myself for what they did to her. I was with Riley all the way, regardless of what she chose to do. Such good storytelling from Hattie Hunt that is apart of the Whiskey Witches universe.	I was given an advanced copy of this title from the author and voluntarily have given this review of my own free will.
0,Really cool book
0,Very well written and thought provoking. Here  you have a race of aliens that consider mankind a "threat" to their way they look at the universe and mankind provided options that they never even considered. Overall a very good read.
0,Very good and very fast,	I loved it, I really exceeded my expectations, it was worth all the money, I do not regret it, seriously thank you very much
0,Intriguing This stand-alone is easy to follow and difficult to put down. No editing or formatting errors. No gratuitous violence or drag-you-down drama.		The storyline bounces between present day and the Viet Nam war. Believable characters with distinct personalities. Thought-provoking and informative dialogue.		No desire to re-read this story. I am interested in other works by this author.
0,I am a great fan of Peter Kowey's novels, and am looking forward to his next book.  In all three of his books, I became totally engrossed in the story, and find the medical themes a welcome change from most other  cop/detective/ mudrer stories.  The main character's wife is a lawyer, and that gives an even brosderder interest to the action.  I give the author 5 stars for his work to date, and hope he keeps it up!
0,Certainly a different world out there, so find it a bit far fetched some time, but then maybe I am just concervative. Have fun
0,I highly recommend "William S. Rice: California Block Prints" to art lovers and especially to those who are soft block or linoleum block carvers or aficiandos of this art media.  It is filled with color pages of Rice's exquisite & evocative art prints and this art collection appears to be quite comprehensive.  This book is a definite keeper in my art book collection.
0,This book is pretty good.  The characters are all interesting and the main character has her own human flaws even though she's a fairy.  The relationship stuff gets a little old toward the end, but it makes me want to read more.  If you like fantasy that is a little more grounded than usual, you'll probably enjoy this.
0,If you are new to SE's books, at this point you have laughed then giggled then gasped out loud and perhaps sighed disappointment as you find yourself a normal human, curled up in your favorite reading place with the entire book replaying in your mind.  The most amazing thing you come to realize is that Ms S.E. Is one of the most talented authors out there and she must love to write cus , I know you will thank me for this bit of info, THERE ARE MANY MORE BOOKS TO READ.  You will never read one of her books and be slapped upside the head with a cliffhanger.  But you will want to read each and every book in the series.  You won't be bored if you read them out of order.  You will laugh and purr and gasp in surprise with each book you read.
0,Loved it.  The book kept my interest.  Glad I read it.
0,Okay, so I read several reviews and could see several people had left lower ratings but decided to take a chance anyhow.	And I'm so glad I did! Yes, there were some minor grammar errors, but the author did a fabulous job building up the angst between the main characters. There were fun, spicy love scenes, lots of temptation, and definite hurdles for these characters and I think the story was well written.	Avery was lovely, always caring for others even if it wasn't the smartest decision for her. Tristan was a selfish man at times, but he still respected Avery's wishes towards the end. Best of all was the happily ever after.
0,An interesting story but a bit contrived.  Good picture of life in Charlston in both the 19th and 20th centuries.
0,Very informative book!
0,This was suspense-filled and I was biting my nails at each twist and turn.  It was almost like I was there.
0,This book has the same magic as sorcerers stone except this chapter of the potter series involves a secret chamber in the school. Even though I still like the first book better, Harry's second year is more challenging as well as more action.
0,This is my favorite series. I can't stop reading. This book is incredible. I strongly recommend it!!! I hope this author has other books.
0,First, let me say I am not an avid reader. I have trouble maintaining attention to a book or article. I love my daily newspaper probably because most of the articles are short and hold my attention. Some of Grisham' s books have been good reads for me. This book by Lieutenant Colonel North was a good read. He moved back and forth to different locations and time periods holding my attention with exciting moments and events. It probably helps that I would fall into that "anark" category. I love God, my family, and my country. This book was hard to lay down. God Bless Oliver North..
0,I love Mark Helprin. He's as good a man as he is a writer, and, in many ways, he's the last honest man of belles lettres in the world. His earlier works, including "A Soldier of the Great War," "Memoirs From an Antproof Case," "The Pacific," and "A Dove of the East and Other Stories," will stand as timeless classics from a period that will almost certainly be characterized by incessant assaults on the English language and, subsequently, the death of literature. Mr. Helprin has no peer in his command of words or in living up to the charge of being true to thine own self.		Many contemporary writers either focus on inane subjects and end up boring the hell out of readers (whether readers, according to that which is currently in vogue, acknowledge it or not), or take on grandiose themes and fail as spectacularly as a stunt plane that crashes midway through an air show. Mr. Helprin, in the manner of the classicist he is, dreams big, takes on eternal themes, and grapples with the paradox of time itself. He rarely misses the mark.		"In Sunlight and in Shadow," I will venture to say, could fairly be classified as reverse eucatastrophe, which is to say, beauty, truth, and good that ultimately begets tragedy. Mr. Helprin's writing has matured from "Soldier" and "Memoir" to a point that will be easily recognizable to readers who enjoyed "The Pacific." The story of Harry Copeland and Catherine Hale, set against the backdrop of New York City immediately after World War II, is primarily a story of selfless love and sacrifice, a motif that Mr. Helprin has mastered with such poetic skill that he could easily stand alongside the great bards of the Medieval and Renaissance eras.		In the world of music, there are fiddle players and virtuoso violinists. In the world of wine, there are Cote du Rhones and Chateauneuf du Papes. In both cases, Mr. Helprin has the complexity of the latter. The banality of overused words of praise like 'gusto,' 'verve,' 'beauty,' and 'majesty' do not do justice to his writing. However, if you were ever transfixed by the movement of clouds lit by city lights during a winter snowfall, or yearned to be transported from the deck of a ship to a point on the horizon where the sea meets the sky, then you will understand the sublimely intricate tapestries he creates.		To be fair, Mr. Helprin is not for everyone. And in reading "In Sunlight and in Shadow," or any of his books, one must understand that plot, as such, is perhaps not entirely linear, and certainly does not lord over pace. One might be daunted by the density of the bocage found therein. The reader must take into account that his rhythm and cadences are defined first and foremost by the beauty of the words. One might even say that the journey is more important to Mr. Helprin than the destination. With that said, my only complaint with "In Sunlight and in Shadow" was that the plot was compelling enough that I was, at times, frustrated by being forced to plow through the bocage. Thus the four-star rating.		Enjoy this book. Savor the words. Allow Mark Helprin to lead you through the streets of New York City and discover for yourself the timeless truths he puts on display.
0,Synopsis: It is post WWI, Ernest and Pauline Hemingway are living in Key West when they hire a young woman, Mariella, whose father died suddenly leaving the family impoverished.  Mariella has earned the heart of not only Hemingway, but the handsome, but disfigured Gavin Murray, a veteran of the war, who wants her heart forever.		When a hurricane bears down on the keys, what secrets will be exposed that are destructive as any level 5 hurricane and threaten everything Mariella has ever thought true?		My rating: 3.5/5 Stars		My opinion: After reading and despising a book based almost on the same characters, I went into this book with a bit of trepidation. I loved the storyline of this book. I felt it was incredibly engrossing and loved the majority of the characters. I must admit, even with this book,  I continue to have a serious dislike of Pauline and Ernest Hemingway that I was hoping to have alleviated in this book.		So why the 3.5 star rating? I have to admit that this book probably would have been a 4 or 5 star read for me had I read it versus listening to it. I found the narration of this book to be highly melodramatic and almost had given up on it.  I found there were periods where the narration was like nails on a chalk board.		Source:  Edelweiss for Tantor		Would I recommend? : Yes
0,This is a great story on a number of levels. It's long but it has more depth than anything I've read in awhile. This book doesn't center around one time period or one issue - it takes 30 years to tell this story. I loved the historical tie-ins. The context is very important to the story and for a person born after 1974, I wouldn't necessarily understand the way the world was for about half of this book. Even if I had, it's important to see what the context meant for Tully and Kate as they wind their way through life.		At its core, this is a story about friendship. It's also a story about love and choices and how we are defined by how we grew up. The characters are likable, even when they aren't trying to be. You can empathize with them at most points of the story.		This book tugs at your heartstrings and doesn't let go. My main complaint is that the story drags a little at the middle and then end but it works.
0,Unpretentious yet powerful ...		The author asks powerful questions and people seemed very candid and thoughtful	in their answers.		I felt "relieved" to know that there are so many wise, courageous, and	intelligent people using their enterprises to make a difference.		And ... I love being a "fly on the wall" to know how the world is	occurring for these people.
0,Following two women in Afghanistan, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the page. The women each take a perspective and display such bravery in an oppressive environment that caught me by such surprise. The book very quickly became one of my all-time favorite books. It has stuck with me for years after I read it, and I purchased it with the hopes of reading it again soon (I borrowed it the first timeand I often don't reread books.) I read the story in two days. I got so wrapped up in this world and these womens lives I just did not want to leave. I cant recommend this more.
0,This is by far one of my favorite coloring books.  The drawings are clear and easy to follow and not too intricate in style and design. However, there is one minor inconvenience, the pages aren't perforated, which makes coloring difficult while the page is still attached.  Other than that, I will definitely consider purchasing another book from ArtyShock in the very near future.
0,This was a very enjoyable Perry Mason mystery. One of the first things I always report on is whether it is a "fair mystery". By that I mean, can you figure out the murderer from the clues given as Mason gets them. In this book, the answer is a resounding yes. However, as is normally the case, Gardner through you a few curveballs to keep you off balance. In this book, I sadly picked the wrong murderer, but for a similar reason by which the real murderer was revealed. But I failed to evaluate two clues correctly.		In the story, we have Mason finding fan dancer's feathers. Some of the descriptions of two women and their performances are a bit lurid for Mason novels. LOL Standard elements are there: Mason's client in big trouble, missing witnesses, Paul Drake pulling out all the stops, and a highly entertaining courtroom scene.		To discuss the courtroom scene, its structure makes this book more like the flow of the TV shows, although in the books Mason doesn't break the murderer down on the witness stand as most often happens on the TV show. However, these courtroom scenes are clever and hilarious ... top notch.
0,I really liked the story line to this book. Brandon is loyal and sweet and Spencer showed a backbone in sticking with him. Great twist at the end - I did not see that coming.  They're perfect together I can't wait for the second book to come out!!!
0,I want to start off by saying that this book first came to my attention when I read AE Via's Nothing Special series the summer of 2015.  I had started You Can See Me at that time but just couldn't quite get into it but that was more down to my need for more Leo & God.  When I realized that only Leo was in this one and only briefly, I just couldn't wrap my head around Pres' story.  Having said that, I wish I had stuck with it just another chapter or two, because this is a great read. So when I read the latest entry to the author's Nothing Special series, and Pres, Ric, & Blair made an appearance, I decided now was the time.  So even though I'm a little late to the party, I still enjoyed myself and had tons of fun.		Mnage stories aren't for everyone but for those who find them intriguing then I highly recommend You Can See Me.  Truth is, this is so much more than just your typical mnage tale. You Can is a story of drama, friendship, recovery, romance, fear, love, and of course there is plenty of heat to spice up your afternoon.  I use the term "mnage" but "polyamory" may fit the ultimate relationship between Prescott, Rickson, & Blair more accurately.  Whatever term you choose to use, it's amazing.  As hot and wonderful as the three of them are together, this story is so much more than just the sex.  Prescott's desperation to be wanted, Ric's fears, Blair feeling used, all of it put together will tug at your heart, leave more than a few tears falling, and your throat dry from screaming "talk to each other" but it will also put a smile on your face with Blair's zest for life and though it's for different reasons, both Pres & Ric's determination to rebuild their professional careers will give you hope and warm your heart.
0,So far I've been hooked on this story about a New York state woman saving and housing disabled, abandoned farm animals.  This book really makes you think about the welfare of animals and how we treat them when they are disabled or handicapped.
0,Hi enjoyed this book by Dianne Harman but I didn't find it as good as some of her past books but it was an enjoyable read
0,This constant looping from past, present and future keeps you reading. Constantly searching for Mitchell will keep you asking " when is it, where is it, and why is it so hard to win?"
0,Am just finishing the Walters book....and hate to have it end.  So glad that I ordered it! .	Book on the presidents was amusing and informative.  I liked it for sure.	Although D'Souza is one of my favorite authors, found these books repetative and too long.	Judgement Ridge happened in my territory.  Well written and a good study in human depravity!	  Robyn Kasupsk
0,I couldn't believe how great it a story it is. A great read.
0,Trust me, if you are looking for a book that kids (and adults) will love, one that has humor, wit and great characters, you can NEVER, EVER go wrong with Dav Pilkey. I laugh out loud every time!
0,I purchased this book for research I am doing on nursing during the Civil War.  I have only read parts of it, but it seems to be a good resource.
0,I was finding the book an interesting read and suddenly the secondary theme ( the abducted sister of one of the males) dropped of the pages.	That was what I was more interested in and the situation was not resolved.	Apart from that well written.
0,Simply put this book was an awesome portrayal of the ordeals of two totally different men and then their becoming friends. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially id they are Pagan or Heathen.
0,Love this authors style of writing. She makes you laugh and cry all at once. A great read for sure!
0,Having two boys at home they say some pretty out of the normal things; well my oldest came home calling his brother a bucketdipper and well my mind went somewhere else and at that point of course I had to research where this word came from ... and this is why I ordered this book.  My oldest who is in Kindergarten was read this book in class and was taught that when saying or doing something not so nice thet was "bucket dipping" which hence the term "bucketdipper." Now there are many reasons thet someone can be a bucketdipper the book goes on to show many examples.  The example I found extremely useful for children to understand which was when someone is hurt they hurt others; I loved this exampl of a bucketdipper.  When someone is a bucketdipper they not only dip into another bucket but they also dip into their own hence not really helping themselves by choosing to be men or have a bad attitude. Now the point is to be a bucket filler the bucket fillers when filling others buckets also fill their own as it feels good to help others feel good. This book allows children to self reflect and think about how to not only earn stickers or checks for their own end reward but how to help others most importantly and feeling good about it as a reward in itself. I highly recommend the collection of these books as it is a great lesson for adults and children alike anyone can benefit from self reflection at any age.
0,Excellent  book  about  the  Navy Seals. It is  exciting  and  heart touching .  Yet very informative  about  the  Navy  Seals training.
0,Just as the title says, this book contains Ken Ken puzzles you can actually do! Toward the end they get more complex and harder, but still possible.
0,I'm routinely using knots and bindings with work and play.  Though decorative, some of these can be useful for getting the loose ends tidy.
0,Matt and Cassandra are a country meets city couple.		Matt is a cowboy rancher and professional gambler that loves his family and his home and will do anything to keep them happy.  Cassandra is an engaged city girl used to the finer things in life and has a dad that is a gambler . (Oh, and we cant forget about Chewy, the Chihuahua either.)		Without giving any spoilers, this story has some touching moments and a bit of humor too. I enjoyed  this opposites attract ,fun, cute, sweet, quick read.
0,Outstanding.  Exactly what I was looking for.
0,If you think the concentration of financial and political power in the hands of a tiny group of predatory families then this is the book for you. If you think it is not a problem, then you really need this book.
0,Gotta get the next one now!!  Keep them coming until all the bad guys are terminated and their cause defeated.
0,This is the best drawing book I have gotten to date. It gives detailed instruction. Almost immediatley I was able to draw realistic looking cats. Using the techniques in the book I was able to expand and draw other animals as well.
0,My first observation while reading this book were the chunks of time I lost, because I was so caught up in the story; always a good sign.  Second, was that the story launches right into the heart of things from the very beginning without a lot of needless build up ( this is not the book to read if you haven't already invested in the series).  To the very end Colfer creates another imaginative plot line, saving his biggest story for the last.  He managed once again to expertly weave an action packed story that is easy to follow, with well-developed characters and humor.  Always attentive to details Colfer even invests in his secondary cast of characters taking them beyond the typical one dimensional characters you usually see in other books. I also love his use of the narrator and really enjoy all the extra info and tidbits the narrator provides.		Colfer brings Artemis' quest for change to a nice final resolution.  It was really interesting to see Artemis develop over the course of the books.  Usually main characters in series do not change much (i.e. Stephanie Plum Series) and that is what keeps the story moving forward.  But in this case Colfer allows Artemis to take full ownership of his humanity, moving him from selfish master criminal to someone willing to sacrifice for the good of others,  while not losing the characteristics that come together to make him Artemis Fowl; the intelligence, confidence, cool detachment and ability to keep his eye on the goal.		If I had to nitpick for something I didn't like about the book it would be Foaly's and the fairy situation underground.  I feel like I had a decent amount of investment into that situation without much of a payout.		Over all I am a happy girl.  While this book wasn't my favorite in the series (that honor goes to the Eternity Code) this book was still pretty great and a worthy ending to the series.

0,This book is awesome!! I haven't been able to put it down since I turned the first page. I!m really looking forward to part 2. Hopefully I won't have to wait long!!!
0,I wasn't a big psychology fan until i read this. It really causes you to take a hard look at yourself and discover the BS  that's in your life. I gave it to a friend who was a divorced alcoholic and he quit drinking and changed his life for the better.
0,I was very much impressed how the author developed her story of this family each one being so different.  It reminded me that we all live in our little worlds thinking about what other people's life must be like but never really looking for the reality that truly exists!
0,This book was amazing! To be honest I'm such a huge fan of Jamie Mayfield that upon reading his insert for this story I bought it. I'm definately better for it. I wanted more! Christi is special in more ways than one. Great read you won't be disappointed.
0,Some nice patterns.
0,This is her best book yet. The story takes turns you never expect. it's  so good  so good I couldn't put it down.
0,Great to have for all the little ones and their parents in your life!
0,A dozen monkish thirty-somethings practice their disciplines in or away from their home base in Garrison Oaks.  Carolyn's practice is language.  Since her parents died, she's dedicated her life to learning languages.  Margaret's discipline is dying, Jennifer's is healing and resurrecting; Michael puts Dr. Doolittle to shame with his relationships with animals of the air, land, and sea.  David battles, and Peter studies mathematics.  Rachel predicts the future.  Almost all of their parents are dead, and they consider themselves a family because since they were orphaned, they have been under the care of and serving Father, a powerful enigma.		Father becomes absent, and none of them know where to find him.  Someone has to take over and lead the family.  No one talks about it, but a power struggle and mayhem ensue.  Some of the family seem clueless.  Others, like Carolyn, are ruthless.		Carolyn enlists an outsider named Steve to do her dirty work, and won't give him a break.  He winds up charged with murder, then escaping jail while being interviewed by a government agent named Erwin, who is badass defined.  What is not clear, and makes the middle of the book a compulsive read, is Carolyn's true motivation and methods.  This is one of the most creative story arcs I've read in years.  It's absolutely impossible, but completely logical.  For a fantasy.		It's unfortunate that Mr. Hawkins did not maintain the urgency of the middle of the book through to the end.  I thought the story would end with a bang, but it ended in a soft, cozy thud.  Still, most of it is a very exciting read, provided you don't mind a little blood and guts.
0,As an outsider, I must say "well done."  This book was very interesting and informative.  I believe that the authors have come to terms with many of the problems popularly associated with modern Christianity in America.  From my perspective the problem is the stereotypes addressed in this book are not true of rank-and-file Christians, but are true of the most conspicuous, visible, and vocal members of their faith.		I have learned some things.  I selected this book because I wanted to understand the phenomenon of religion in the world around me.  In particular, I was interested in the phenomenon that is Christianity in the United States today.  As the authors correctly recognized, outsiders in America are generally well-educated on the basics of Christian doctrine and the claims of the Christian faith.  Still, I understand where Christians are coming from when I did not before.		It appears that the word "Christian" is not of much use in predicting what attitudes a person will have.  Eighty five percent of Americans self-identify as Christian.  What that 85% of Americans mean by the term varies widely.  This helps me to understand how Christians can claim on the one hand that this is a Christian nation and that they should be entitled to have the state acknowledge their supremacy, while at the same time they complain of being a beleaguered and disfavored minority.  I used to think it was mere convenience.  It is much more than that.  There appears to be a minority within Christianity which does not accept the majority's claim to be members of their faith.		I was not surprised to learn that "the lifestyle activities of born-again Christians were statistically equivalent to those of non--born-agains."  Page 47.  That is consistent with my experience as well.		I would be happy to learn that many of your the Christian faith are reading this book.  It is very informative for people outside their tradition as well.  To me this book is not a call to action but it gives me some insight.  To members of the Christian faith, this book should be a call to action.		JG
0,How I wish Id had this wonderful book to read when I was a young Army wife! Jens words of wisdom would have been just what I needed to endure the long days of TDY and solo parenting! Drawing on her experiences from living around the world, her stories are engaging and her down-to-earth encouragement is like having coffee with a dear friend. I especially love the challenging thoughts at the end of each story. This is one of those books I will return to again and again for inspiration. ~ Karen Campbell
0,This reminds me of when I went to sicily in 2011 when we ate all the food there yummy... true to the island itself... want to go back but this next time NO tours... want to eat and live the sicilan way on my own time.  wonderful country if you never been you gotta go
0,I like Margaret Coel books. They are not full of twists and turns but I like the stories built around the Arapaho and Shoshone reservations. I read all of Tony Hillerman's books and was looking for something similar and voila, these are close.
0,This is a great book for readers new to Brenda Jackson's books.  I first read Surrender and wondered who are all these people she's talking about?  Now I know.  Justin, Dex, and Clayton are highlighted in their own books in this collection.  My favorite by far is "Eternally Yours" -- Clayton and Syneda's story.  They don't have as much emotional baggage as the others in their books (which is a good thing), but they did have plenty of sparks flying between each other.  The funniest scene is when they are in Florida on the porch after returning from dinner.  That was hilarious!		If you are new to Ms. Jackson, please get this book.  You won't be disappointed to get to know these brothers from the beginning.  Now as I make my way through the rest of her books, everything and everybody fits.
0,Like meeting up with an old friend full of surprises.
0,It starts out a bit slow but I can tell the author was meticulous in his exploding current and future technologies. Good fun read.
0,Fabulous story. Loved how it all tied in. Couldn't put it down.
0,Good recipe book for HCG. ketchup recipe is a huge hit even with the none dieter in my house and much healthier than store bought.	my only issue is the measurement of the recipes that make more than one serving. once cooked its hard to make sure you get one portion. start out making the one portion ones to get your eye used to what a serving is. The recipes are flavorful and nice variety. very helpful on HCG diet which can be blah and boring if not given good recipes at the start. there a lot of prep work so make in quantity servings and measure out into containers will save you time later.
0,This story quickly pulled me in, and though Im in my thirties now, this novel brought me back to age fourteen like it was yesterday. Wendy, the main character in "10 Steps to Girlfriend Status," is easy to identify with, and her authentic teen girls voice carried this story along at an enjoyable, breezy pace. Shes fresh with hopes and dreams as she begins ninth grade with many changes on the horizon: some exciting, some mysterious, and some worrisome. How she deals with them makes for a lovely story of growth and discovery.		The author wields words well, immersing the reader in the moment, with no unnecessary verbosity clouding the novel. The story deals with some heavy issues in a sensitive way without making the story depressing, including Alzheimers, blended families, and first time dating. Lessons are learned about remaining true to oneself and remaining a caring, kind personeven when things don't go the way one wants.		While this book is second in The Bird Face Series, it can easily be read as a standalone novel (I didn't read the first one yet, and this didn't present any issues for me). "10 Steps to Girlfriend Status" is a wonderful read for preteen and teen girls, with many themes they can relate to and learn from, all in a highly enjoyable and entertaining form.

0,DCI Banks takes us on another exciting journey and the twists and turns are really most enjoyable. I am always sad and excited to get to the end! Well done Peter Robinson, another great read!
0,This is a book that I would label as very important if you are interested in making family or just your own plans for any huge emergency that can happen over a widespread area. Luckily, the 31 days it specifies don't have to be sequential!  Some of the items listed are too much to accomplish in a day, I think.  But it's all laid out in logical order and with good instructions and encouragement.  I recommend this book to anyone who is concerned about a catastrophic event of any kind...this book could be an important part of your planning to live through that event.
0,This book was so well written! I am in love with this story! Two people beating the odds and making a wonderful life! I'm speechless.
0,I received a free copy for an honest review of this book. Loved this book! I found myself staying up late to read it. It was one of those books that you keep on saying one more chapter then I'll go to bed. Megan is a fabulous writer! Will definitely be reading more of her books!
0,In Small Gods, the thirteenth novel of the Discworld, Terry Pratchett gets philosophical, religious, and existential on us, delivering a remarkably insightful look at man and his relationship (or lack thereof) with the gods.  There are gods everywhere on the Discworld - you can't swing a simian librarian without hitting one - except, of course, only a few people can see them.  Each small god lies in wait, desperately seeking to make someone believe in him; on the Discworld, gods need people more than people need gods, for belief is the food of the gods.		The story takes us far away from the environs of Ankh-Morpork to Omnia, a land on the Klatchian coast ruled by the priesthood of the Church of Om.  It's an arid, harsh world where the Quisition works tirelessly to beat the sin out of individuals deemed to be suspicious (and almost no one is safe, for the priests regard the very existence of suspicion as proof of guilt).  You would think that the Great God Om would bask in the glory and power of all that faith being demanded of the people, but ritual has replaced substance in Omnia; the people may worship Om, but they don't really believe in him anymore.  For the past three years, the Great God Om has been stuck in the body of a one-eyed tortoise and has only now been able to find one man with the true flame of faith burning inside him.  Unfortunately for Om, that one believer is Brutha, a novitiate in the Church whom, all would agree, is just a little bit slow on the uptake and is just about the last person Om would have chosen to become his new Prophet.  Brutha does have a perfect memory, but all that memory crammed into his mind leaves little room left over for actual thought.  In a way he fits right in, though, as the Church does all it can to discourage individual thought, because that kind of thing just leads to trouble.		Naturally, Brutha has a hard time accepting a tortoise as the Great God Om, and Om doesn't have the power to do anything but curl ineffectual oaths and curses at things that bother him.  Om is actually a pretty surly little god, but spending three years as a tortoise, having to worry about falcons swooping down on you and then dropping you from a great height, tends to bring out the worst in gods.  Brutha is increasingly disturbed to learn that Om never really gave his followers any instruction whatsoever; all of the holy books he knows by heart suddenly come into question, and that's hard on a true believer.		As the novel progresses, Brutha finds himself accompanying Deacon Vorbis, head of the Quisition, to the land of Ephebe where philosophers cover the landscape like locusts, argue violently among themselves, and generally live in barrels.  One such philosopher is Didactylos, whose philosophy can basically be boiled down to the words "It's a funny old world."  He now becomes the unifying part of an underground movement that insists, despite the tenets of the Church, that "the Turtle moves," that turtle being, of course, the Great A'Tuin.  As so often happens, religious dispute breeds war, and the future of Omnia - not to mention the future of the Great God Om - lies in the palms of Brutha.  There is only one thing you can be sure of in such a precarious situation: somewhere nearby, Cut-Me-On-Hand-Off Dhblah will be there selling all sorts of wossnames - onna stick.		Pratchett's razor-sharp wit cuts especially deep into religion, society, and the body politic in this novel.  To some degree, organized religion is being satirized in these pages, but it's a healthy and honest sort of criticism; more than anything else, Small Gods is an ingeniously subtle philosophical examination of the meaning of life in an uncertain world.  Pratchett offers one explanation as to how and why gods die, and there is more than enough weighty material in these pages to give us pause in between fits of laughter.
0,One of my favorite authors.  I wait for her net book to rea.
0,Halo The Flood is worth reading, but not what I expected. Halo The Flood is a novel version of the original Halo video game. The exact story and events that happen in the Xbox video game happen in this book. It was a very quick read. If a friend has a copy of this book you should definitely borrow it, but don't buy it ( unless you won't too DUHH! )	Overall: Great, no, good, if you like the story of the game, then yeah. Worth reading, Yeah. Is 'Fall of Reach' better, oh yeah. Enjoy this book, but read 'Fall of Reach' first.
0,Lady At Arms is a tense and wonderful book!  Full of intrigue and a powerful story line you will not be disappointed.
0,I loved this!	Finn is clearly in need of help in the first book.	In this book he decides to take matters in his own hands, but is it the right way?	I loved how his vulnerability came out but still in an alpha male kind of way.	I love the brothers!!
0,A wealth of information.  Excellent dictionary and easy to read.
0,Let's be honest. This subject has been done an a lot. With that said, this is a fun read. I enjoyed it a great deal, and highly recommend it. Mr. Nuttal asked if there should be a sequel. My answer is a huge yes, can't wait.	  The characters are likeable and very human. Nobody is perfect all have faults but do their best in very difficult situations. They  adapt and overcome in the best tradition of humanity. This story has a realistic feel to it. The problems of trying to deal with an alien culture are constant and no easy answer is found. All in all I liked how the story progressed. Some books you finish and think that was time wasted. This booked I was sorry to see end.
0,it was a good collections of short stories from the old West
0,what a a great book, I loved every minute. wonderful writing and fantastic characters. I cant get enough of the immortals after dark series. do yourself a favor and pick these up.
0,As I expected
0,The trouble with witches: I am happy they are shaping out Annie's character a little more. Storyline of clove meeting the parents is still focused on Landon and bay which to be honest I'm sick of. Landon and Bay are the focus of every book and I'm disappointed because I would like to read Thistle and Cloves point of view.
0,Some things are funny because you didn't know other people noticed the same things too.  Some things are funny because they are so true of human nature....no matter if the human is a Christian or not.  Some things are funny because you can't believe he "went there" and called it.  I had several moments where I laughed out loud :)
0,I don't love the story. Wish it was more about the actual going on the potty instead of just buying all the stuff--potty, underwear,etc...
0,'All my Sons' is Arthur Miller at his finest. Beautiful, tragic and real. The more heart-rending because the characters are so like us, we love them for the mirror they present us with, but have to reject them to redeem ourselves.
0,Jeffrey Ricther has written a very thorough yet readable book describing Microsoft's .NET Framework from both 3,000 feet and, at the same time, 1 millimeter.  His direct interaction with the Microsoft team that developed .NET has proven to be a competitive edge that other .NET books currently on the market lack.  If you're serious about .NET programming in any language, this is a book you need to buy and read multiple times.

0,Her books give us a view of the subject in context!  This book gives us a glimpse of the skull in cultures of the southwest.  It is one of my favorites.
0,This book reads more like a novel than a history.  Although the subject matter is frightening, the insights are wonderful and the language is often deliciously poetic.
0,Nicely interwoven, original female perspective, sufficient twists. The very setting and plot are a bit overused though.
0,RE-READ THE MAGIC!	Being that I am an adult and was also an adult when I read this story the first time it was published  I kind of surprised myself when I knew I had to own this copy. So glad that I listened to my enter Hermione and brought it. What a wonderful copy this is. It really brings the world of Harry Potter to life once more. The artwork is the real star to this book as well as the size. If you are a fan of HP this is a must have, If you have a child who has never read HP, this is a must have. What a great Christmas gift this will make. I am thinking of buying copies to donate to my local library and children's hospital. The movies are great but nothing is better than opening the book and getting lost in the pages. Thank You again, JKR.
0,I read the Phoenix Pack one of the best stories ever written. I was so glad she has continued on with the Mercury Pack.  I love Derren and Allys story love the twist and plots of the stories. You gotta love a story that captures you and keeps you on pins and needles trying to guess what's going to happen next all the way to the end. Ms. Wright doesn't write short stores she writes stories that tell a whole story from start to finish with no cliffhangers . I started reading years ago this is t he way a story is told. Ms. Wright keep writing I guarantee you have a reader for life.
0,CHARM CITY picks up a few months after the events of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baltimore-Blues-A-Tess-Monaghan-Novel-Tess-Monaghan-Mysteries/dp/0061210021/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Baltimore Blues: A Tess Monaghan Novel (Tess Monaghan Mysteries)</a>. Tess is still living above her Aunt Kitty's bookshop, and the endearing musician/bookseller Crow seems to have worn down some of Tess' reservations about a possible relationship. She's even relented enough to accept a job as an apprentice investigator for the curmudgeonly lawyer/rowing instructor Tyner. But this unusually "normal" period doesn't last long, as the editors of the Beacon-Light hire Tess to investigate a case of a reporter undermining the system, publishing a controversial article that was never meant to run. In no time, the subject of the article turns up dead. An apparent suicide. Tess follows the trail through the ranks of the newspaper, convinced the suicide was, in fact, murder. Several secondary characters get some great fleshing out in this second volume, notably Tess' best friend (and crack reporter) Whitney and the always awesome Crow. I am now completely hooked on this series and thrilled to find there are, count them, seven more to go. Bring on the fun.
0,The Iron Fey series is one of my favorites, as I love how Julie incorporated an entire new realm into the Nevernever (fairyland). So you can imagine how excited I was that she decided to continue the saga with Ethan's story!		Sad to see that Ethan has grown up to be a bit of a jerk. But it's not really his fault, as the Fey have made his life miserable enough that he's had to come up with some rules to try and help him survive. Unfortunately, those rules practically guarantee that he won't have any friends and will keep getting in trouble. Plus, his poor mother worries.		At a new school (not the first one), Ethan tries to keep his head down, but trouble still manages to find him. Despite everything that's happened, Ethan is a good kid who can't ignore when a half-fey is being bullied. He steps in, and starts down a road never expected.		Really enjoyed revisiting this world, and loved getting to know Ethan in more detail. And Grim! Love that cat! Plus we're introduced to Kenzie, an amazing girl who won't take no for an answer and wants to find out what makes Ethan tick. Really enjoyed her character! So brave and resourceful and funny, and I'm hoping she sticks around.		Julie hasn't lost her touch and she continues to come up with great plots, interesting characters, and awesome writing! What can I say, I'm a huge fan!		This is an exciting new spin-off of the Iron Fey series, and I can't wait to see what happens next for Ethan, Kenzie, and Kerrian!
0,Almost finished reading this book, I found this book to be educational in the area of psychic abilities.
0,These characters are the kind that you take into your heart and they become a part of you. You begin to feel as if they are your family and you can't wait to see them again.  I love the main character Nurse Lee and also "Chummy".  Simply delightful!!
0,This is a great compilation of  recommendation letters, and the one thing that I know is that you won't be able to find anything like this anywhere. I found the letters to be very effective and useful and the one thing that I like best about it is that it is a full book not several articles put together and called a book. The author took his time and did it right. Because he did that we have a book we can actually use. I highly recommend this book.
0,Usual disclaimer: I was given a print copy of Powerless by Tim Washburn for review.		As the title (and cover) imply, Powerless is the fictional account of a world wide collapse of the power grid caused by solar activity.		Author Tim Washburn takes an every-man approach to the story. It is not sensationalist doom and gloom like we see in the media today.  It is however, a very sobering book for that exact reason. Powerless, while pointing out how a government may handle such an incident, focuses more on how the average person is impacted. It does not preach about our reliance on electrically powered technology, but shows the effects.		No secret that I like post apocalyptic stories, so Powerless is right up my alley. Washburn does not rely on mass rioting and savagery to highlight the disintegration of society. He instead focuses on individual characters experiences. Some do okay, others not so much. A good balance, not an all is lost kind of story. The primary characters are honorable, even the politicians (remember, it's a fictional account). The bad guys don't get center stage.		I suppose a reader can see Powerless as a "message" book, but I don't read it that way. I read it as and action/adventure story with good characters, a believable plot, and a very entertaining presentation. Yes there is violence, but not exceedingly so. And of course there is romance and even sex (not violent, or rape). It will make you think: What would I do...? I don't think this book will inspire a wave of "prepperism", but then again?		Powerless by Tim Washburn is certainly worthy of a look. Enjoy!		Mike

0,And we thought we knew the story of Cinderella... not so!		Annora is a sweet, innocent, lovely young woman who is caught up in a world of magic and lust when her father makes an unfortunate remarriage following the death of her mother. She is in part rescued, and in part used, by the Fairy Man, who, in return for her help in his mission to retrieve a mysterious potion, promises to aid her in the rescue of her father. Cinderella must meet and marry the Prince... but love isn't a fairy tale, and this Cinderella's Prince Charming isn't the Prince you'd expect!		Romance, adventure, and magically erotic! All wrapped in a beautiful, lyrical style of story telling that has you enraptured from the very beginning to the very last word.		I loved the Fairy Man, the mystery and romance, and yet the originality of him - I was almost disappointed when he evolves beyond the bantam description (I know, a little vague, but I do no wish to give away the story). I loved the subtle strength of Annora, her believable motivations and her "just an ordinary girl doing the extraordinary" courage. I loved the blending of several Fairy Stories into the one.		"As you wish" is a reader's wish come true - it is not just a good story, it is a piece of art.		Mystical, magical, and surprising - don't hesitate, buy it!

0,The son of a senator has been murdered and now Detective Creed Lowell and his partner, Andrea Myles, find themselves caught in the middle of a supernatural war....		  Creed knows he's always been different.  Despite being an active member of the NYPD's Occult Crimes Unit, he's carefully avoided anyone who might be remotely sensitive to supernatural energies.  His carefully guarded secret is about to be revealed, along with all the burning questions he has once he meets Riana Dumain.  Riana is part of a specially trained triad, a group of Sibyls who are locked in a battle against a nefarious group called the Legion.  Riana is attracted to Creed instantly, but is he an Asmodai, one of the very demons they are battling?		  Wow, what a phenomenal start to what looks to be a great new series!  Anna Windsor does a marvelous job at building her world and making it work for her in BOUND BY SHADOW.  The concepts of the Sibyls, Asmodai, and elemental powers have a strong basis in legends but Ms. Windsor puts her own sexy and sassy spin on them.  It's hard not to get wrapped up in the sheer beauty and power of the world she has created, with the various aspects of good and evil creating a very potent storyline.		  BOUND BY SHADOW is more plot driven than character driven but this isn't to say the characters are weak by any means!  Rather, Anna Windsor's characters evoke deep emotions from the reader as they make sacrifices in their quests to ultimately "do the right thing".  Creed is a unique hero, a man who literally is at war with himself.  His struggle is an emotional one and one that still leaves me impressed by the strength of his inner convictions.  Riana is quite a contrast, a woman in a position of power but unsure of her leadership skills. The clash between these two is an interesting one as the heart wars with what the head says.  BOUND BY SHADOW is a very complex but satisfying story. Highly recommended!		COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES

0,The Tarot is a wonderful visual interpretation of life. It is a catch all for our beliefs about ourselves and others, and it takes into account conventional wisdom, subconscious archetypes and behavior patterns that can be applied to interpreting any given situation. You'll learn to recognize exactly where to focus your attention and how to realign your energy to bring about positive change.		Regardless of your spiritual tradition, this book will help you realize that peace of mind, body and spirit is internal and only a breath away. Phenomenal little book that could change the world. If everyone would read and begin to practice the principles outlined in this slim volume, the world would indeed be miraculously transformed and we could actually have heaven on earth.		For those looking to deepen their awareness and compassion in daily life, this is a really good book. A practical manual to help one implementing small changes into every day. It is valuable in wisdom and the readings some in short sections that make it easy to maintain your focus as it is read to you.		Through combining ritual tools of empowerment, we strengthen who we are as individuals. What better way to maintain the courage to walk an individual path!		I was given this book from Schiffer Publishing. www.schifferbooks.com
0,If you read the first novel in this series you kind of expect crazy things to happen. I loved that novel however this one blows it totally out of the park. It smashed it. This novel is soooo much better. I had a hard time putting it down. It literally engrossed me from the first chapter.	Kensington aka Kensie we meet as a kind of stand offish roommate. She discovers herself in these pages. It's not a smooth road but of trial and error. CT blows up everything she every thought she could want. They are like magnets. The chapters fly by but the tornado is still coming.	I feel like my heart was just ripped out of my chest and crushed halfway through. The corruption and plot was completely unexpected! My heart broke for Kensington over and over again. I know she is the cheater. I know she done horrible things but that was just.... I have no words.	This is the epitome of the perfect rocker romance, not only because of the lies and decite but because of how much heart break lies in the pages. It's very well written and I can't wait to see what comes next for these characters....
0,Love it!!
0,great read!

0,Loved this and have listened to it several times. Highly recommend!
0,I had a near death experience and saw and felt the loving light.  Ian's description is so accurate and a wonderful story of God's love for us all.
0,I might have gone 3.5 stars if that were an option.  I was quite surprised and interested in where the story went though.  Although the characters were interesting, several of them were not particularly likeable. But perhaps that made them more realistic.
0,Good book, well written, interesting story. The author has again done a good job with putting this case in a book that you can read in a day if you so wish. Just the type of books that I prefer.
0,ok book
0,I love mideavil times with princes, kings and dragons as well as evil magicians; and this tale did not disappoint!
0,The polarization in American politics has disturbed me for many years, particularly the bizarre conspiracy theories used to justify political positions. This is the best explanation I've seen for why it's so hard to reason with people on the opposite side of the political spectrum. I plan to argue less with committed ideologues and spend more time with people of moderate views
0,Bryce and Jane have a common enemy. She wants to keep him behind bars and needs information that Bryce has but is not sure he should share. He is trying to protect his daughter. As the danger increases, they really grow close and he is determined to keep her safe.		I like the mix of action and romance. They make a great couple. They are both strong and protective of the people they care about as well as willing to take on danger to keep others safe. He made some mistakes but he has made the right decisions about protecting his daughter.		I am voluntarily reviewing a copy I received.
0,What can I say, very interesting writer. I guess I will read whatever I can find...just a small amount to read yet.  I am loving hardbound used books.
0,enjoyed the book
0,I could not resist a book called For Love of Words, in part because I rate words as my favorite tools.  Yet, this thought-provoking tale could. just as easily have been called For Love of Story.  As Alison, the narrator returns home to prepare her thesis, she finds herself confronting her past.  From her complicated relationship with free spirited and unconventional mother, to a burgeoning romance with an old friend, and her almost unacknowledged yearning for her unknown father, Alison is searching.  What she finds is a jewel of a bookstore, a mesmerizing reader named Henry, and a purpose for her life.  The importance of Words, and story emerge in an unexpected but compelling fashion.  I found this a wonderfully satisfying and deeply thought-provoking read.
0,p.j. has been among ny top 1 since i figured out what a lug nut was for couse i took all six off
0,The world is divided into many parts. Where I live, such things are unbelievable. Women are still struggling for basic human rights. How can we help them?
0,I just loved this story about Jackie Nolan. A bad girl for the right reasons along with a conscious to boot. I cannot say much more because of giving away the story. I will be buying #2 in the series!
0,I thoroughly enjoyed Blood Magic! I found myself waiting breathlessly to see what happened to Renee next.  I bought this for my Kindle, but will also be purchasing a copy for my bookshelf! Total must read of the year!
0,This book shows you how to build strength, power, athleticism, and astounding physical ability using only your bodyweight as the resistance. Learn how to perform many different types of push-up, pull-up, core exercise, lower body exercise, and conditioning movement, and in the process develop the strongest and most capable physique ever.
0,A very enjoyable read.		A must before reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS, or even after.  I am glad the film's a trilogy.
0,Another great story from this writer. The main character is an awkward teen that you pity and root for in the beginning of the book. If you know the author, of course things take a dark turn! As the story progresses, the more you get to know Nigel, the more you fear him and what he will do. You will treat socially inept people a little differently after reading this book. This is the first book from this author that I have read that doesn't involve the supernatural or aliens. He doesn't disappoint.
0,This book is adorable and very funny.
0,I bought this book for my Grand daughter.  She just loved it. and learned alot of our Nations history,	This book let her understand what happened to Lincoln and what was going on in his last days before	he was killed.  Since she is eleven. I think she learned and retained a great part of our History.	Is a great book for younger People and also the Older ones too.	It Should be read!!
0,... this book really started out slow.  After about 70 pages it dawned on me, "I'm learning new information, and it's going to help me.  A lot!"  This thing really drags out for awhile, but I really understand so much more than I did before reading it that it's worth every penny and every minute I spent with it.  After awhile it gets very, very interesting as things start to come together.  After a few hundred pages Pelz starts to go through drills and they look like real gems.  He's got more drills than my dentist.  There are months and months worth of great things to work on!  I love that because it means I'll get better, and I look forward very much to the work.  This book should have an index.  It does not and I would recommend that you highlight useful text in yellow, and write in pen atop each page a short summary.  What's the best putter grip, the best club, the best way to putt at an angle downhill, why putt at a target at 3X your ball deviation from the aimline, etc., etc?  Dave Pelz covers it all.  Pelz pushes some of his products but that is useful.  Who knows better how they work?  And a workperson is worthy of her/his hire.  Glad someone has these useful tools available though I plan to make some of the more expensive ones myself.  If you want to putt better, need some exercises and some basic information so you can figure out your own problems on the green?  Then buy this book.  If there is a better book on putting, I have not seen it....END
0,Love it. The characters all grow and/or show greater depths. Story advancing nicely. Very good read.
0,a definite must have book! love it!!! stop reading this, and go order one :) ships fast! and packaged well. very happy!!!
0,I thoughly enjoyed this book.  It  was funny and had me wondering what was going to happen next. Poppy is a bit of a kluts and godrick is pure alpha male. I throughly enjoyed all the characters in this book they were absolutely wonderful
0,I just finished this book today and I read a lot of books , all non-fiction or true crime ... I have only given one review .. it has to be a very good book for me to take the time to write a review .. My heart goes out to Elizabeth Acker .. I don't know how you got through your childhood .. Your mother is one sick cookie .. I have no respect for her or your father-step father .. He just stood by and watched his wife abuse you and did nothing .. one spineless human being .. It's a great read .. I wish you the best Ms. Acker .. and my luck was to have a good mother .. who never raised her voice to me .. let alone her hand .. I truly wish you could have had the same .

0,Extraordinary writer; Soul inspired. Expresses her own love dance with her albatross friends as she describes the nuances of their extraordinary lives.
0,Must have for anyone wanting to work in psychology. This is like the bible for mental disorders.
0,I loved this book could not put down. it was full of suspense a really interesting and great book. I would certainly recommend Martina Cole a great author.
0,Edward Steichen's family of man was the greatest photography exhibit of all time. This is a powerful book.		Try to get one that is in perfect or near perfect condition as it is an old book and some are very worn.
0,This is a rough read, but so worth it... you are going to want to stop but keep on pushing.		I think this is a really unique perspective on the horrors of the concentration camps. Seeing it through the eyes of children that are trying to make sense of their surroundings and that are trying to survive. It's an odd mixture of navet and wisdom beyond their years.		On top of this, the writing is absolutely stunning!!!
0,I have been proven wrong!!! Fake Fiance was yummy however, I Dare You just took first place in my mind and it was delicious. I mean, like how can you have a crush on someone for a long time and not make a move until you know for sure she has a thing for you? Maverick is a push and pull for me. In one moment, I am in love with you Delaney and in a moment I have to let you go. Like dude!? Choose dude. Now our heroine!!!! I am so in love with her. She is strong, funny and such a down to earth person. She was willing to wait and see where life take her after the accident with Mav. This author knows how to fish for reader. I was proven wrong to assume that Sunny from Fake Fiance will have only spot in my heart however make more Sunny. Thank you for the book Ms. Madden-Mills. Please let this be in audible soon.
0,An irregular scouting squad attached to the US Army takes on zombies, cannibals, and survivalists.  A nightmare of apocalyptic proportions is dealt with by individuals who have lost nearly all of their past and present. The story of a team that forms its own framework for survival.
0,Definitely would recommend!  Great story line, good characters, and lots of intrigue.	Wonder how close to the actual truth!  Can't put the book down!
0,Charles Cumming has written a flawless collection of spy novels.  "The Spanish Game" is the sequal to his first novel, "A Spy by Nature."  Characteristic to all of the novels is a well-researched, highly-plausible and unique intelligence operation, but the driving force is always the characters, their relationships and their flaws.		What should delight the reader about the intelligence operations that Cumming depicts is that they are not hackneyed derivatives of daily headlines in English language newspapers.  His characters are not battling Bin Laden in Pakistan.  They're pulling off subtle operations that Cumming has devised from research, ingenuity and, perhaps, some excellent sources.  So the reader is interested in the plot precisely because it isn't one that had already been related in every newspaper.		Yet it is always the characters and the relationships that propel Cumming's books.  The intelligence operation in "The Hidden Man" was the least inventive, yet I enjoyed that novel best because the author made the lives of the characters so interesting.  In all of his novels, the plot concerns the political intrigue of intelligence operatives, but the impact relies especially on the domestic intrigue among the characters: jealousy, adultry, pride and, especially, ambition.		No, as other negative reviewers have observed, the central characters are not likeable.  Alec Milius, the main character of "The Spanish Game," is especially flawed.		That doesn't mean that the reader should be disinterested in his fate, though.  Milius' ambition has driven him into difficult circumstances, and what little solace he is finding there he is stealing from the person who has been kindest to him.  I'd assert that every human being has felt the tug of ambition though and has contemplated a heinous action.  Alec is someone who has succumbed to those temptations.  Indeed, he is remarkably incapable of resisting such temptations.  I find him to be neither unsympathetic nor uninteresting.  Rather, I find him fascinating to watch.  The interesting character in "MacBeth" is not Duncan, and it is facile to say that MacBeth is not a sympathetic character.		Comparisons between Cumming and Le Carre are natural and useful.  The Le Carre novels that I've read have all been naratted from an external perspective.  We've learned about the characters by watching their behavior.  Cumming takes us inside his characters.  We learn about them by listening in on their thoughts.  In Le Carre's novels, layers of deception are exposed and further layers are implied.  In Cumming's novels, it is layers of self-deception that are exposed.  In Le Carre's novels, there is some power that asserts and retains control, behind the machinations of the characters that we observe.  In Cumming's novels, there is no ultimate power.  The characters flail around one another, and we sense governments flailing around beyond them.		The writers offer different experiences, then, but I'd expect that fans of the one will also be fans of the other.  They're both literary novelists first, who happen to have chosen the secret world as their context.
0,A great book!  I read a lot of history and am surprised that I had not run across this man before. I couldn't put the book down it is so interesting.
0,Kristin Callihan has become my most favourite author, I cannot wait to read the next book in the Darkest London Series. Since I read her first book, FIRELIGHT, I could not wait to read the next book in the Darkest London Series. They are all wonderful. You will understand once you read the first book, you won't be able to stop. I hope you enjoy reading these books as much as I have.		56babsey@gmail.com
0,This is a very fine book, and should be read cover-to-cover. It is not a reference book or a beginner's book but I think anyone can gain from reading it.		I would like to comment on some of the other reviews which "gush" with what reads like professionally-prepared reviews. I am very suspicious of such reviews and you should be too!
0,This was one gripping adventure, it is a book that will keep you up at night emersed in one heck of a story. I can not wait to start book too.
0,Attitude, insight and perpetual coolness from a marketing genius with wisdom to spare. Buy it.  Yeah, just buy it. End.

0,Good deal
0,A different story about courage.
0,I enjoyed the book very much. It had an unusual story line that was refreshing.
0,Literally couldn't put it down until I was finished!
0,I haven't seen the movie yet, but I plan to. This novel is a page turner. I was just out of college in the eighties, and I played some of the video games in the story, including Tempest. The references to eighties culture are terrific.
0,Phenomenal book!
0,Great book, This method is very easy to learn and understand. Learning medical terminology is a memory game and this book has that covered. Anyone taking this class with this book is guaranteed an A!
0,The Eleventh Commandment was my first Archer book, and it wowwed me from  start to finish.  I liked Archer's style of setting up characters  throughout the book, resisting the temptation of telling you the  characters' entire life story in the first chapter you meet them.  I found  myself thinking I knew how the story would end -- and revising my thoughts  several times.  A quick, but challenging read for anyone who loves  government-oriented plots.
0,Just as with most world-wide examples today, the historical lives of English monarchs and other persons of power and fame was dominated by men.  But, as women mature I personally believe we grow weary of so much exposure to one-sided male perspective.  This book helped alleviate my weariness.  Meade does Eleanor, and the rest of us, a service by telling Eleanor's incredible story of power and politics and gender with a historians well researched, reasoned clarity, a scholar's forth-rightness, and a woman's sensitivity.  And what a story did Eleanor's life make!
0,Lincoln Chafee is an honest man who presents a challenging view of the Bush regime.  His story gives hope to a crippled nation, that a ferrier could rise to the station of US Senator, representing his constituency and nation with a commitment to integrity, sustaining the idea of America.  When he decides to run for POTUS he has my vote.
0,Great story
0,I had  this to read  along with my 33 Days to Morning Glory.  There is so much we didn't know or realize about or Immaculate Mother.  So inspirational and this book will open your heart to Mary who will direct your to Jesus.
0,Wow! What a creepily awesome novel this is! I absolutely loved the world Mr. Beer created and found myself quickly drawn into it. I can definitely describe it has a dark fantasy with elements of horror woven into it. If you like Tim Burton movies and Joseph Delaney or Stephen King novels, then this is for you.		Crik is about a boy, Jack, who lives in Crik village where every inhabitant possess a unique Talent. Jack's Talent is his shadow, Yang, who is ever present, mischievous, and unable to be controlled by Jack despite what everyone else believes. One night, Jack accidentally witnesses the origins of these Talents, and wanting to know more about his shadow and how Talents came to be, he begins on a journey of discovery. While the main characters of this novel are children, for me the content and themes are written more for adults.		Mr. Beer is a very talented story teller and this novel was beautifully written. He has a vivid imagination that doesn't conform to the norm and is easily transferred onto paper for readers to enjoy. While this book is a bit long, there is always action leading to the next scene. I recommend for anyone who enjoys dark fantasy.		Thank you to the author for giving me a copy to review!
0,Shultz, aided by his illustrators, is a very good tutor. Far from trivializing, the book gives a substantial introduction to the complex topic. However, the easy reading can be deceptive as it still takes work to understand this complicated subject. A good memory is still a requirement as I found reviewing and use of the glossary to be essential. Contributions of Mendel, Darwin, Morgan, Watson, Crick  and others are well detailed, as well as biology of cells, mechanics of reproduction, and the role of DNA in heredity and maintenance of life. Ethics of cloning and GMOs is covered with little bias. History of human evolution and projection for the future is examined with just a bit of speculation. The rest of the book is totally factual. This is the best I've seen for a comic book form tutorial on any subject.
0,I loved this book! I would have given it five stars and a tiger except it rushes through the eastern European,  final part of the author's amazing trek by paddle, oar and quant from Wales to the Black Sea.  I rushed through that part too so I could learn how the author got away from the hoodla (plural of hoodlum) who kidnapped him. I think both of us, the author and I, were in a hurry by then to complete the experience. Or maybe he was pushed along by the mighty Danube at a speed too fast to allow for reflection. Clearly the trek was grueling and I think the author's magnificent narrative powers made me feel something of his exhaustion. The author is funny, insightful and helpful to those who would learn how to row through Europe. I suppose I never will do so, but I have benefited by reading this splendid account by this brilliant writer. My thanks go out to him for his having written this wonderful narrative and my recommendation goes out to all who might read this book to do so
0,Read all 10 books and they continue to be enjoyable
0,Loved the series and how the two series ended together in one story...quick read couldn't put it down...would read again
0,Never Let You Go is a work of fiction that pulls you into the story from the first page. It is intriguing and exciting. The main character is a young mother who has suffered many tragedies in her life. She made some mistakes when she was younger, but had spent seven years turning her life around. Then several shady characters from her past converge on her life at the same time. She is presented with some difficult choices that could have dire consequences. She and the other characters grapple with some hard concepts including the battle between good and evil. I didn't want to put the book down. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys fiction with a bit of suspense.
0,I'm not a paranormal romance person- but I do love Jessica Park. So I tried clear and I did love it! What I loved most though was her character development here. She makes you see these people, especially costa
0,Jesse Stone is a very interesting character with many layers. I have enjoyed the series immensely . Can't wait to get on to the next one.
0,The most beautiful, tragic story I have read in a very long time.  The author really wrote eloquently.  I felt that I lived through those horrific years with Vianne and Isabelle!  Highly recommend!
0,I love the books that Debbie Macomber has wrote about these three mischievous angles. No one writes like she does. I have a lot of her books in paperback.
0,Amazing! Words can not describe how amazing and suspensful this novel was. There were so many twists and turns and you never knew who was who until the final 10 pages of the book. I was on the edge of my seat after the third chapter of this novel all the way up to the last page. A true page turner!		This story is very hard to describe, but I will try to give the basics. It is a story of lust, romance, hate, lonelyness, love, envy, and just about every emotion you can think of. I really can't give much more than that because if I do I will give things away. There is so much mystery and suspense in this novel that you have to figure out, that if I said anymore I would give away the main tie to everything else.		If you are looking for a great page turner, this is the book for you! This book was a mystery/thiller/murder/family bond/suspense. All in one.		Great read and hope you enjoy it as much as I have!		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Disintegration/dp/B0048EL5M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Disintegration</a>
0,As it was getting close to Valentine's day, we decided to get this book for my kiddo to read.  She absolutely loved it, particularly the mystery of who left the special Valentine!
0,This is a scholarly account of years spent in China.  It is carefully crafted using honest descriptions, sometimes humorous descriptions.  This book affords a very enjoyable read!
0,Jennifer is an excellent young woman. I sincerely feel she deserves better than all the success she can clearly envision. I liked her so much that I decided to buy her book EVEN IF I NEVER READ IT. That's how impressed I am by her and the introduction, and the beginning of the book, I read before the book was released.
0,OOOhhhh! The suspense keeps our kids on the edge of their seat reading this story! They far surpassed the chapter reading requirements for their book club!
0,In 1980, President Carter made the decision for the United States to boycott the summer Olympics which was to be held in Russia.  This decision was made because the United States wanted to make a statement protesting the USSR's brutal invasion of Afghanistan.  For the most part, the United States Olympians were devastated by this decision.  Many of them had put in thousands of hours training for the opportunity to represent the United States.  Many of the athletes were at their peak and this would be the only opportunity that they would have to participate.	 "Boycott" tells the stories of the athletes and how President Carter's decision impacted their lives.  Information about what was happening at the time is interspersed in between the athlete's stories.  I felt that the inclusion of this information makes the book unbiased.  If I had just read the athlete's stories, I would have been very angry that this boycott occurred. Having read the history of what was going on; I gained a greater understanding of why President Carter made his decision.  I still don't agree with it, but I do have a better understanding.	 After reading "Boycott" I agreed with many of the athletes who recommended that the United States not be present during the opening and closing ceremonies. I think that this would have made a greater statement to the world. By not participating at all, I felt like the athletes were being punished, and the USSR was being handed medals that could have been won by many of our athletes.  In effect, we were handing them the opportunity to achieve greater fame for their country because they didn't have us to compete with.  The effect of our boycott faded in time on everyone, except the athletes who lost their dreams of participating.  I was fourteen years old when this happened and had no memory of it until I read this book.  If we had participated in the games, but boycotted the ceremonies, I believe that we would still be seeing the clips from the ceremonies, as a reminder, every Olympic year.	 The athletes really impressed me.  At the time this was happening, most of them were just kids.  Some of the insight gained by them is shared in "Boycott."  I found many of their attitudes to be inspiring to me.  I wish that things could have been different for them.  My grandfather was a gold medalist in the 1932 Olympics.  He had the opportunity to participate in a rowing event.  He was proud of his win, but his true passion was in wrestling.  After the Olympics, he decided that he would compete in wrestling in the 1936 games.  Unfortunately, a serious neck injury ended that dream.  While he was proud of his medal, I always felt that he regretted not being able to represent our country in the sport that he was most passionate about.  I felt that this was the case with these athletes; they had some that they were passionate about and wanted to show the world their abilities.  By denying them their opportunity to compete, we denied them their chance to shine and we denied ourselves the gift of showing them off to the world as representatives of the United States.	 Brothers Tom Caraccioli and Jerry Caraccioli make a winning writing team.  I appreciate their willingness to share both sides of the story.  Being that we are in an Olympic year, I was pleased to have the opportunity to learn about an important historical event regarding the Olympics and United States athletes.  Considering that the 2008 Olympics took place in a country historically and currently known for its abuse of people, I found the timing of "Boycott" to be perfect.  This is definitely a thought compelling book.
0,This is a book that you give to your children. They will refuse to read it or just not understand it immediately. Tell them that their response is understandable. Then, tell them that they must make a promise to you to keep it anyway. Some day they will finally pick it up before they are going to give it to Goodwill and just read a few pages. This will happen after they graduate from college and hopefully after they have a graduate degree as well. Or, it could happen when they are searching for someone to tell them about how the American understanding of philosophy or psychology came into being and possibly be sick of the suffocating Freudian world that is understandably never included in cognitive science books of today. But, still remains imbedded in the "go deep" Freudian Buddhism now the rage. They will discover an evenhanded and pragmatic view of the early 1900's. The lights will go on and they will find a comforting voice of reason and adventure that is the mind of William James. They will see a mind that is relentless in its freedom to search anywhere and look at anyone's ideas with an open curiosity and not just to gain support for their drive to be famous and exclusive like Freud did all of his life. This is not easy reading. The language is twisted and driven, questioning everything in the early 20th century. But when they stay with James, they will receive a gift that will enrich their life, a voice that becomes their mentor, a friend, father or mother who wants them to grow in any direction they want. With James, you feel like you have a partner who deeply cares about whatever search you are fond of. James is not trying to sell you his world view, but he is trying to make you think better about your life and everything that is important to you. This is the basic democratic view of the imagination and what it can do if it is released from the elitist cords of European history.
0,good suspenseful
0,This man, though seemingly normal, killed two wives and his own children. Clearly not so normal. I hope i didn't reveal too much, but the author reveals all very early. The book was well researched and well written. I would recommend it to true crime readers.
0,Charming book.  Very good read.
0,Very interesting book especially in these times.  An interesting look at Islamic hate 150 years ago.
0,Couldn't put this book down! This debut story I read from netgalley made me laugh, cry, and want it to never end! I can't wait for the next book to come out. This is a cliffhanger so beware but well worth reading!

0,I have read a few books by Melissa de la Cruz but this is the first book in the Blue Blood series I have read and considering I only started reading book #7 I wasn't really confused but I wish I would have read the other books before.		I very much enjoyed this book so much that I have now put the other books in this series in my long list of books I want to buy. Gates Of Paradise is very well written and I just couldn't stop reading it.		I highly recommend this book.		*I have received a copy of this book for my honest review*

0,Still laughing.
0,Well, Im sold. I wasn't sure I would be. Like many other romance book junkies, I have a crap ton of book series that Ive already collected still waiting to be read.		For what its worth, you're unlike any other woman Ive met. You make me feeleverything.	*	Youll never feel alone again, Ava. I promise.		A lump forms in my throat, emotions overcoming me.		Youre going to make me fall in love with you more every day, aren't you?		Im certainly going to try. You deserve to be loved, and you have so much love to give. Im happiest when you look at me like Im your whole world, so Ill make sure to work hard to earn that look.	**	Luckily, I was charmed by this story. It had two very strong lead characters, several interesting supporting characters, fun pacing, humor, and plenty of steam. I especially loved the fact that Ava and Sebastian were both in their thirties and had each achieved success the hard way. Obviously, Avas non-fraternization work clause was no match for the chemistry they had together. And, I was thoroughly entertained by the progression of their relationship and Avas integration into the Bennett family fold.		One of my favorite lighthearted moments takes place at the office:	I pull myself up straighter. Just so you know, all these long hours mean youll get laid a lot less.		Well see about that, Sebastian replies, a rueful smile on his face.		Does anyone care that Im in the room? Logan throws his hands up in the air.		No, Sebastian and I reply in unison.		Okayglad we settled that, Logan concludes.		I also loved the cute epilogue and the fact that Pippa and Ava were scheming to pair Logan up with Nadine, Avas bestie. Up next in the Bennett family series is Logans story.

0,It was a gift for my mother and she can't get enough of this author.  Shipping was fast.
0,This book is a little long in explanation for me, but it gives you variety in your green smoothies, which helps in increasing alkaline content to your overall diet, hence reducing inflammation and stress in your body.  I always do what is easiest, ie, for me it is spinach leaves, water, half a banana, and spearmint leaves from the garden.  If you have peppermint, even better.  But putting kale into smoothies is a good idea and there are some good recipes for serious vegans to introduce more variety into their regime.
0,I have become an Irene Hannon reader. Having read all of her last 2 series, I am really liking this series the best. Trapped actually has topped her other books so far. There was one loose end I didn't feel tied up correctly, but I still enjoyed this book. Trapped is a mystery thriller, even if it says Romantic Suspense.		In Trapped we return to our current favored PI - Dev, James Devlin. Laura Griffith has taken on her 16 year old sister, Darcy. Only Darcy isn't happy with the rules, and while a horrible snow and ice storm rages, Darcy leaves home. Her parents dead, Laura is her half sister and only living family member. Darcy figures Laura will not miss her. She is wrong.		The hours tick by , then the days, and a brave but frantic Laura works with Dev to try to find her sister. Before long it becomes a stronger and stronger possibility that she has fallen into serious trouble. The deeper they dig, the worse things look for Darcy.		Meanwhile, there is a tormented soul who is seeking redemption. He is looking for the right woman to save him. His idea of redemption isn't exactly ours. No, not by a long shot. He is an "upstanding" citizen, with some idiosyncrasies that will rock most readers minds.		No, it didn't scare me, but it was a very good page turner. I thought Irene did a wonderful job of her villain, and of course the new characters. I was glad to see the progression of things in Dev's life too.	You will enjoy this one!
0,A good story with a lot of  twists and turns, that'll keep you reading it until the end.
0,First of all, I have to thank the author for having me stay up ALL night long to read.  Believe me, it's a good thank you because I truly enjoyed it THAT much.		Now that I have my insomnia thanks out of the way....		The book picks up exactly where All In left off, in the car, going to Ethan's sisters house.  I absolutely devoured it and grinned, then actually teared up at some parts (I won't leave spoilers, that's for you to read your own self).  Ethan... bless his british heart.  I absolutely ADORED him.  He's perfectly flawed and OMG... molten hot in the way he feels for Brynne.  Reading it?  You can tell that this is it.  She's the ONE for him.  They're absolutely perfect together.		I absolutely LOVE this series and am ecstatic that there's going to be a fourth book.		Keep fueling my insomnia, Raine!  LOVE it!!
0,This was a great read , I enjoyed it from beginning to end .
0,Easy to read and concise--just the overview I wanted before I began an in-depth study.
0,good
0,After watching the show, you can hear Dr. Pol's voice as you read the book.  It's as if he's talking to you. A good read!
0,Could not rate it less as was anxious to return to it at every opportunity.	Takes awhile to separate the characters. Interesting characters who all have different personalities and life stories based on happenings in their past.	As you read on the stories within the story begin to merge.	Just as everyone's story comes to an end there is a surprise!
0,The Odyssey is an amazing novel.  The story is awesome and the translation by Albert Cook is great.  This novel is great because it gives us a look at what ancient Greece was like.  They valued marriage, they expected women to stay at home, that men would die in battle, on the sea, or raiding other people, and also that something that was unexplainable was due to the gods.		This novel is a great adventure.  The Odyssey begins by showing Odysseus to us through the words of Meneloas and Nester.  Then we are brought to Odysseus and learn his plight.  We see him released after seven years of living with a goddess.  When he is rescued again, we learn of his voyages since leaving Troy and the reason that one particular god is so angry with him.  Once his story is told, his rescuers bring him to his fatherland.  He then takes vengence on those who had ravaged his home while he was away, and he is reunited with his faithful wife Penelope.		As well as being a great insight to Greek life, this novel is a great story that I look forward to reading again.  I highly recommend it.
0,I will be singing in the chorus of a Mikado production this summer. This was a big help.
0,Grace loses her sister Casey and must raise her niece Evie.  She has	done it before since their own parents fought each other and were	just after money.  She worries that her mother will fight her for	custody of Evie.  There is someone that would like to help her - but	should she trust Mitchell, who called her a liar years ago?  Worth a	read.
0,This mystery/thriller is full of action from the first paragraph to the end! Extremely strong female character Abby does not fear being in harm's way and seeking the truth. I loved this book and am now reading a lot of this writer's work. Although I had never heard of this writer, I first purchased a Michael Prescott kindle book special through Amazon just to try because of the great reviews. I have not been disappointed. I now recommend his books to friends, and I look forward to reading more of his work. Using Kindle through Amazon is a win/win when you get a great book like this in mere seconds!!
0,Author Doug Wilson has written a thorough biography of the legendary third baseman of the Baltimore Orioles.  We all have had individuals who have assisted us along the way in our lives and Brooks Robinson had an American Legion baseball coach named George Haynie, a major league mentor in George Kell, and an influential first manager in Paul Richards.		Robinson's major league career spanned the years from intermittently in1955 through 1977 and those years were filled with memorable years of All-Star games, gold glove awards, and World Series performances in 1966 and 1969 through 1971 with World Championships in '66 and '70.  His performance in the field against the Reds in 1970 made him a highlight reel.  Author Wilson does a commendable job in relating Robinson's acrobatic fielding plays against Cincinnati in 1970, but the plays really had to be seen to be appreciated.		What really makes Brooks Robinson special is that he always had time for others.  He would sign his autograph legibly rather than a quick unreadable scribble and engaged in conversation with those he was signing for.  You will find no scandal associated with Brooks Robinson in this book.  This is a book you can give as a gift to a child who enjoys baseball and reading since you will not find it laced with profanities.  In other words this is a book for all ages to enjoy.  Brooks Robinson is a genuine baseball hero and a credit to the game and the Baltimore Orioles for whom he played his entire career.  It was fitting that he entered the Hall of Fame the same year as his major league mentor George Kell both of whom are natives of Arkansas.  Many thanks to author Doug Wilson for giving us this biography of Brooks Robinson to relive his career and for those who were to young to see him perform his wizardry on the diamond.
0,"Stella" is the fascinating tale of a lovely, young and blond Jewish woman given an incredible "Sophie's Choice."  'Die along with your family or cooperate and save both yourself and your loved ones.'  Cooperation, of course, meant cooperation with the Nazis at the lowest level.  Stella would have to search out and betray hidden Jews to the Nazi death machine.		Stella made her choice and I do not judge because, never having lived through the horror of arrest and threatened extermination, I don't know what I would have done.  I'd like to think I would have chosen "honorable" death over dishonorable life...but...I really don't know.  Nobody knows what they would do if faced with a similar fate and a similar choice.  Christ said, "Let he who is without guilt throw the first stone."  I wouldn't and won't throw that stone.		Stella made her choice and it was a horrific one.  She became a griefer and was responsible for hundreds of arrests.  Hundreds died who might have survived had Stella never existed.  The story implies that Stella may have taken some satisfaction in her skills.  I don't doubt it.  Once a person gets pointed in a certain direction she usually gains satisfaction from a job well done.  Besides, there is the Stockholm Syndrome where the victim identifies with her victimizer.		This story is valuable at seveal levels.  It is a study of human nature under remarkable stress.  It is also a study of the complexities and inconsistencies of the Nazi extermination system.  Stella lived but her family died.  Would she have also been killed if the war had gone on longer and her source of victims dried up?  Or would she have lived like a lovely butterfly in a bottle?  Would she, with her blond good looks and charm, become an honorary Aryan?		I'm reminded of a story told on Heinrich Himmler.  He is walking outside the wire of one of his camps one day and spots a goodlooking blond man behind the wire.  He called him over so he could talk to him,  "Are you a Jew?"  "Yes." the clueless man answers.  "Are your parents Jewish?"  asked Himmler.  "Yes." replied the young man.  "Are your grandparents Jewish?"  "All Jewish." the man replied again.  Himmler shook his head, "Then I'm sorry I can't help you."		This story is fascinating because it implies that Himmler may have saved the man had he proved less than completely Jewish.  Likewise, Stella might have survived the Holocaust even if Hitler had won the war.		Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God" on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico
0,This series is fast becoming like literary crack for me - I couldn't put this one down. I thought about it at work and even dreamt about it when I was sleeping. I guess I'm lucky that these were written a few years ago so there's no agonising wait for the next one - it's just waiting for me in my Kindle.		This one was simply heartbreaking. Z has suffered incredible abuse in the past and now bears the scars both physical and emotional. Bella, who we met in Love Eternal, has been kidnapped by the Lessers. Zsadist, who she made an impression on before her disappearance, is desperate to find her. Believing her dead, he goes on a rampage before a lucky escape by a civilian vampire allows him to find her to discover she too has been treated most cruelly.		There's plenty of other plotlines going through this one but this is the story of Zsadist and Bella and how she brings him to life through her love. He pushes her away constantly but her love for him is strong and healing. It's beautifully done and very very touching and Zsadist is, emotionally at least, unrecognisable at the end of the novel from the vampire we first met back in Dark Lover.		There's a lot going on here too and we have the shocking loss of a much loved character - totally didn't see that one coming. I cried at the grief that followed.		So, Butch and Marissa up next - bring it on!
0,Even better than the first installment and the cliffhanger at the end is diabolical, but I love it!
0,Amazing book!!  I sat down to read this one last night and couldn't put it down!  Well developed characters and plot, an awesome start to a new wolf shifter series!!  I can't wait for the next one!
0,What an amazing journey through the most interesting woman - full of life, love, vigor, enthusiasm, open mindedness, intelligence and joy.
0,Sylvia covers all the basic religions views on God in the first half of the book. The second half is not quite as dry and much more interesting.
0,It's a wonderful feeling to say that I knew from the second page of this book that it would be good. Not having read Lansen's earlier novel, The Girls, I now feel envious of those who have, since talent like hers as shown in The Wife's Tale makes me believe all her writing must be wonderful.		The Wife's Tale is a novel about Mary Gooch and her life. Her constant battle with food and her body, her ever-present hunger, her ghosts from the past reminding her of better times. Times when she was happy, and carefree, and skinny. It's about her secrets and her husband. Her husband of twenty-five years who she married when she was young and svelte and pregnant, before she gained the weight and lost the baby. Her husband who disappears the night before their anniversary, saying and doing nothing, just leaving. Leaving her with her secrets and hunger until the day she wakes and realizes she doesn't need food. She wakes from her life and chooses to take a step in a new direction, to embark on a journey. To become someone other than the woman who only wears dark navy scrubs, the woman from Leaford who is incredibly obese. To be the woman who solves her own problems. In the journey she takes to find her husband, she finds herself: the Mary without the food.		This story was heartbreaking and sad, but also incredibly beautiful and lyrical and literary and uplifting. Lansen weaves Mary's memories into the story which help us to understand her pain, weight issues are something to which most of us can relate. Brutally honest and blunt, occasionally fresh and funny, but always true and real from the perspective of an overweight women who feels helpless, this was a touching message of hope and the power of change and strength in us all.		I loved Mary Gooch. I loved her for being honest with me about who she was and the secrets she has. The chocolates, the binges, the tabloids,  the obsession. And I loved her for making a choice, for leaving Leaford, for going after her husband, and then changing direction on the way. For following her father's old advice to "take a drink from the hose and push on."
0,Great sci fi read and quick.
0,This was just the kind of book I needed yesterday. Romantic, well-written, emotional... just lovely.		Aria Watkins has been through tragedy and this is her comeback story. I've read a lot of similar NA books this year, but this one is a standout and it tugged on my heartstrings in a new way. It's paced well, the characters are all likable and believable, and it manages to find a healthy balance between humor, romance and sadness. I found myself grinning at parts and I'll admit that I cried as well.		This is definitely one of those stories I plan to reread. It was the perfect holiday escape!
0,The were very well written and you couldn't help but care what happens to them. The author made you see what life was like on a wagon train. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves time travel with a happy ending.
0,I read on another site that this was not going to be a trilogy, only two.  Just finished it last night.  A pretty good read, but once the US war machine got cranking, it was pretty obvious that the Americans would walk over the Japanese.		The occupation of Japan is going to be far more brutal than history, after the news of the treatment of Americans in Hawaii gets out.  The Japanese fleet is essentially in the same state as it historically was after Midway.		The main reason there will not be another book is that so few of the main characters survived the retaking of Hawaii, particularly the Japanese.  Either that, or they are tied to Hawaii; the story would not be continuing there, but deeper into the Pacific and into Japan itself.  However, the taking of Japan without the A-Bomb and the fight against the insurgency if the Emperor had not been co-opted could have been interesting.  A quagmire?
0,The information I've always looked for. So many books and sites tell you things that worked for them but never really explain why. Reading this book and the Fascinate test really helped me understand my brand on a deeper level. It's provided insight how to present my brand and why so my brand is attractive to my target market. Highly recommended if you want to tailor your brand to your audience on a deeper level.
0,Warning: Have Kleenex ready!!		I jumped into this story,  not expecting the direction it went into. I expected something entirely different, but it was still a good book nonetheless. I loved how it turned into something that shows you what true, passionate,  unconditionally love should be. And how selflessly they both were and are, considering the situation. The message was thought provoking. This isn't my first book by the author,  and definitely wouldn't be my last.
0,I read this book here in Brazil. This book has many photos; all of them black and white photos. About the attack to Pearld Harbor, the book doesn't talks only about the attack itself, but also about its results for both: americans and japaneses. As an introduction, this book is good.
0,Great

0,Howling wolves! Marauding Swedes! Neighbors burning each other's matrirachs at the stake! For slaughter and devastation, nothing beats the Thirty Years War, fought across 17th Century Germany at roughly the same time as the colonization of New England. Considering that it was fought with sticks and stones, and a few well-nicked swords, no war has ever caused a greater number of civilian casualities per capita, or determined a nation's future so decisively for so many centuries. It was a war of religion, of course, always the most ferocious, senseless kind of war, fought between sects of Christians who hated each other as devilishly as Sunni and Shia in Iraq.		Simplicius Simpicissimus - stupidly retitled here as "Adventures of a Simpleton" - is the greatest classic of its time and place, the Don Quixote and Forrest Gump of German literature, yet not widely read in the English world. It's as funny as Flashman, as philosophical as Candide, and as human as Tom Jones or any other great "picaresque" novel in history.  "Picaresque" derives from the Spanish word "picaro", meaning rogue, and our hero Simplicius is certainly a rogue, at least in his middle chapters. (The prototypical picaro was Lazarillo de Tormes, of Salamanca; if you haven't read Lazarillo, stop now! Read it and come back another day!) But Simplicius is first described as a rare fool, a child raised with no knowledge of the world, a "holy innocent" with the comic ability to outwit almost any adversary. Eventually a different fate awaits the simpleton-turned-knave, but you'll have to read the book to discover it.		A note on translation: This is a beginner's version of Simplicius Simplicissimus, abridged and narrated in generic plain-speaking American English, with no pretensious archaisms. Quick access, in short to the basic story, but lacking the quaint smack of von Grimmelshausen's rollicking dialect. For German readers, a translation has no point; the original is far easier for them than Shakespeare for Americans or Don Quixote for Spaniards. There are several more complete English translations, but in their efforts at completeness they tip toward ponderousness.		The real origins of the picaresque genre are far deeper than the Renaissance or Baroque. There are essentially picaresque "novels" in Hellenic Greek and pre-Christian Norse, and the great Chinese rogue, the Monkey King, should be part of every child's library. But as a study of human depravity during times of civil war, Simplicius is unsurpassed.
0,Sir Edwin Arnold delights the reader with unmatched grace in the quest to introduce the reader to the lovely world of Buddhism and its Truths, and the incredible story of Prince Siddhartha Gautama who (after much, much suffering) while sitting under the Bodhi Tree in Bodh Gaya awakened out of the wheel of sorrow and ascended into pure enlightenment, wisdom, love, and mercy, therefore becoming The Buddha.		- Five starts for the heavy introduction to "old English writing" and its beautiful nuances.	- Delightful read, no dislikes at all.	- I would recommend The Light of Asia to anyone, especially to those who already have some knowledge of Buddhism, since the author incorporates the history and teachings of Buddhism in poetry form.
0,This is a pretty thick novel so to say I read it in two nights is saying a lot. To say that the second night I read about 3/4 of the book and stayed up till around 2am finishing it says even more.  I was worried initially that it was going to have one predictable ending and I was happy it did not.  It fully explored and followed through on the idea of "what if a modern American woman signed up for an arranged marriage service... and went through with it". I guess some might say that it was still somewhat predictable, maybe not predictable but at least somewhat reminiscent of a certain movie that stars Matthew McConaughey.		The book is broken down into three parts. Before she gets married. The Wedding. After the Wedding. Each part will hold your interest and keep you waiting for the next and to find out what she will do.		I've not read anything else by this author but I'll be looking for her book Spin to check it out.
0,What a fantastic new book from Eloisa James! I've read tons of her works; some I found wonderful, some I found barely acceptable. "The Duke Is Mine" is one of her best! Funny, witty, a bit ribald, sexy, adventurous... a definite twist on the "Princess and the Pea" tale.		"A test?" Georgiania asked, her tone rather dubious. Olivia nodded. "Do you remember that old story of the lady who was decreed to be a REAL princess because a pea had been hidden under her mattress? Well, this is my version. No prince is REAL if he obeys his mother." (p 289)		The book is exceedingly well written with believable and enjoyable characters who are refreshingly unique for historical romance, as is the plot. The oooonly (minor) failing of the author's was (in my opinion) Quin's confession regarding a certain red kite. That all was handled a bit too tritely for my taste, but over all not a problem. Quin is sexy perfection as the little understood (even to himself) HEA (her Happily Ever After) and Olivia is the perfect dollop of sassy, brash, disobedient, loyal, insecure, warm-hearted, and realistic. I sincerely hope Georgiana's book is next!		I HIGHLY recommend "The Duke Is Mine" if you love: historical romance, romance, wit, comedy, salaciousness, and tree climbing.
0,TYPE OF AUSTENESQUE NOVEL:  NON-Austenesque, Women's Fiction		TIME FRAME: Present Day - the beginning of September to New Year's Eve		MAIN CHARACTERS:  Three forty something wives and mothers - Tamara, Jennifer, and Bridget		WHY I WANTED TO READ THIS NOVEL:	I'll be honest, unlike Marilyn Brant's According to Jane and A Summer in Europe, this book wasn't instantly added to my wishlist.  Three women in unhappy marriages contemplating affairs doesn't really sound like something my romantic heart would enjoy.  But having read and ADORED both of Marilyn's other books (as well as her lighter contemporary romances) I figured I should still give it a try.		WHAT I LOVED:	- Three Heroines:  I loved how this story was divided up by the three main characters.  Some chapters followed just one of our three heroines at a time and others displayed their exchanges and interactions when they assembled together.  I liked having multiple main story lines, learning more about three diverse heroines, and seeing the story from three distinct point-of-views.  Triple the heroines, triple the drama, triple the romance!		- Accessible and Real Marriage Issues:  The return of an ex, the emergence of indifference and inattention, feeling unfulfilled and undervalued - all these things are common causes for unhappiness or dissatisfaction in marriage.  It was interesting to observe how each couple dealt with these issues and how they altered each woman's feelings and futures.		- Complex and Philosophical:  Lots of introspection, self-examination, and reflecting going on.  Marilyn Brant does a fantastic job of conveying the varying dynamics and dilemmas in modern marriages.  This novel isn't just a simple romance - it is thought-provoking, sensitive, and multilayered!		- Marilyn Brant Staples:  There are some things you should expect to find in all of Marilyn Brant's novels: decadent and vivid descriptions of food and a music playlist that perfectly matches the story's tone.  I love this about Marilyn's novels!  The only downside...the reader doesn't get to eat the delicious delicacies first hand! (I so want to eat Bridget's creations!)		WHAT I WASN'T TOO FOND OF:	- More Resolution, Please:  I sort of wish that there was a little bit more closure for this novel.  I really enjoyed my time with Tamara, Bridget, and Jennifer and I would have loved to seen a little more of how their futures panned out.		CONCLUSION:	If you are skeptical about this novel because of the premise or because it sounds like it is about extramarital affairs  - I'd recommend you still give it a chance.  It is NOT about adultery and divorce.  This novel is about self-identity and relationships.  As with any Marilyn Brant novel this story is well-crafted, absorbing, and skillfully written!		Austenesque Reviews
0,Great pace and suspense supported by good writing and solid historical detail (and invention). Engrossing and entertaining, it's a guilty pleasure to jump back and forth between imagining the historical reality and suspending disbelief as I'm caught up in the plot.
0,Excellent!
0,OK.story was great though it did play with my emotions.  I can't wait for the next bookwhich might be the last book of the series. EEEEEEKKK, but I'm sorta happy that this series will be ending soon.  I get really wrapped up with the characters and I just love them and want them to be happy now.
0,Girl! Now you KNOW I'm gonna miss me some Cash & Keyshia ! But I love how this series ended . As usual I laughed , I got sad , I was surprised ..just every emotion there is I felt & I LOVED every bit of it ! Outstanding job I can't wait to see what else you have in store for us
0,Love the series and highly anticipated this book.  It is well written with a deep dive into the tortured love story of Chris and Sarah. This book changed my opinion of the characters.  I felt Sarah split herself open and kept coming back to Chris who expected everything but gave very little. It appeared he was always setting a situation up where he would always be the victim. Excited for more to come in the series!
0,The Book is better than the  small group series.  the book is more in depth
0,Could not put it down!  There were parts where my chest literally ached with anxiousness to find out what was coming next and hoping it would end the way I wanted.  Loved the anagram's, very creative!
0,I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. The characters are engaging,the plot well thought out, and the ending is perfect. I will be looking for other books by this author.
0,Cuando empezi de estudiar espanyol este libro me confudio pero cuando tiempo paso y me volvere mas conocido con la idioma era un bien recurso. I still suck at Spanish but at least I can consult this book (along with spanish.about.com) and get in better speaking shape. It's definitely good for travelers who have some book space.
0,I loved this book! It really gripped me and pulled me in! I can't wait to read more!!
0,...it's all good.  I've read scores of marriage books; I do premarital and marriage counseling, and find Love to Stay an excellent book to give to engaged couples and newlyweds.  Good for the Church Library as well.  An easy read with solid advice and helpful stories, Hamilton deals with connectedness, intimacy, forgiveness, problem-solving, and managing the seasons of marriage.  Marriage is risky business, and the stats bear this out.  Someone said to me out of real concern, "I don't want to be my fiance's future-ex."  People don't enter marriage intending "till divorce do we part," yet there is genuine fear that things may not work out.  Couples need to do the hard work to make the commitment last.  Hamilton gives some tools to help make that happen, along with spiritual resources to get necessary help from Above.
0,A classic poetry book.
0,This is one of my very favorite children's books of all time. Its clever and fun and funny and keeps the child engaged both through its rhymes and the character experiences themselves. Its the perfect gift and addition to any bookshelf- boy or girl.
0,Honestly, I didn't know what a verb was until studying high school French (damned late 1960's "I'm OK, you're OK" elementary educational experiments) so the whole issue of speaking and writing grammatically passed me by when it would have been painless to learn it. Argh.  Fortunately, one woman with a good grip on the gnarly weirdness of English and a compassion for the accrued errors in common parlance has weighed in to help. I voluntarily took myself to my college's Center for Academic Assistance to learn many of the lessons in this book, but not all stuck. So, I am thrilled to have a great, concise generously-illustrated guide to good grammar. Of some of the mistakes discussed, I said to myself, 'I knew THAT.' While reading too many others, I'm ashamed to say, I thought, 'What the hell is wrong with that?' Short of having a grammar nazi review every piece of your writing and explain your own personal grammar problems, this is pretty damned wonderful.		Another reviewer (the 3-star review counterpoint) points out Ms. Casagrande's supposed misuse of "had." This 'had' business bedevils me so I checked the Prentice Hall Grammar Guide and lo and behold, the reviewer is wrong because he ignores the existence of several subtle past tenses beyond just vanilla past tense. So, I will enjoy reviewing this without qualms to brush up my English. Thank you, Ms. Casagrande. I owe you an apple.
0,It took me a wee while to get into this, but oh my god I cannot put it down now, it's written well, it does very occasionally go off on a tangent but never for long, but the premis behind the story is what makes it an original for fantasy/magic lovers. Don't want to spoil it for anyone suggest you just read it
0,I saw the movie made of "Green Journey", the precursor to this novel, and loved it. So I went looking for more of his work. This sequel is so delightful, full of interesting/unexpected twists and turns and character development. The relationship between Agatha and James continues as they travel, and after she returns home. You will enjoy them and all of the characters in their lives!
0,Take your time reading this to savor the author's use of language and description.
0,Like flying, the destroyer duty was endless inaction followed followed by action so intense it is beyond comprehension. This book does a good job of placing the reader in the South Pacific WW2 setting.
0,Love this series, but hate waiting for the next one. You most definitely need to start with the Big Bad Wolf Series first to really get to know all the characters in this series. Heather Killough-Walden is one of my favorite authors, she is right there with J.R Ward in my opinion. Can't wait until the next book.
0,What a wonderful approach to writing a novella.  I absolutely loved the way this story was told through letters, messages and phone calls.  Even though it was a short easy read, it had depth that many full length novels never achieve.  It also gave a lot of background to characters who I'm sure will play a part in Mrs. Wade's upcoming new Bradford Sisters series.  After reading this, I'm anxiously awaiting the first book's ("True To You") release in May.
0,Fast pasted, very interesting book.	Just as interesting as the other 3 books before this one.	I recommend reading it.
0,Very credible and entertaining! Fun to read!
0,I learned so much and enjoyed all the intrigue --fun book.  Glad it was a Book Club choice as it got me out of my usual genres.
0,THANK YOU, Professor Rutledge for writing this book.  As Anderson Cooper implored folks to do at speech of his I attended, "Never ever let people forget Katrina".  Thank you for your wonderful book that personalizes the stories.		I too was one of those stories as I was trapped in the Superdome and couldn't escape until a group of us were smuggled out.  I wrote my story in Diary From the Dome.  Wish I had possessed your writing talents though.		[...]

0,I love Martha Grimes and this installment of her Inspector Jury  series is probably the best so far. She has given her Jury character a chance for happiness, which long time readers have hopes for, but will it last. This book should be read before you read The Black Cat because they are linked together.
0,The story, Ship of Theseus, was a great read on its own. Add in the additional story going on between Jen and Eric's notes, along with all the inserts and you become part of the story searching for answers. I rarely read a book more than once, but I will definitely be reading this again in the future just for the experience of feeling like you're part of the story.		I opted to read the novel first, ignoring the handwritten notes and inserts. Then went back and read the notes in chronological order and inserts. Lots of paging through the book, but lots of fun.
0,This is the third novel of "Vampire for Hire" series and I find myself becoming a little bored. Slow reading, not much going on except for newly turn vampire learning her own restrictions. The main character life changing rapidly as she floundering to adjust. But, no bell's and whistles to hippy storyline just yet . . . Hoping for more. Not throwing in the towel yet. Still feel it is a worthy read and I want to know the outcome of her son.
0,This book is a big help in these times for people who require a quick study of the scriptures.  The bible is a book of truth and it requires diligence in reading.  It took me several readings of the bible when I first encountered it as God's Word.	If I had this book to begin with it would have help me in my study of the scriptures.  Therefore I believe this book is a good beginning to help one appreciate the Bible, and to grow in the knowledge of God who would have all men to be saved.
0,For a while now, I wanted to learn Python to make myself more marketable.  And, Python Programming was the perfect crash course to get me going.  This little book has everything you need to get started.  Throughout, it provides screen shots and examples that are especially useful.  I found Python Programming easy-to-understand.  It doesnt make assumptions that the reader already knows certain things, but explains everything thoroughly.  Python Programming will definitely be my go to reference as I begin utilizing my newly learned skills.
0,The excellent Jesuit historian, John W. O'Malley, provides a broad and sympathetic overview of the papacy from its beginnings through the time of Benedict XVI (Joseph Ratzinger). O'Malley keeps the narrative moving along at a pretty fast clip since he is covering so very many figures. Readers will get a balanced sense of the major issues at important junctures in the span of the popes and an often clear sense of the diverse personalities represented across these "Vicars of Christ" (at least those for whom we have good documentation). This is not and does not intend to be a predominantly academic or in depth treatment of the Petrine Office. His treatment of the papacy in the last two hundred years gives readers some very fine and nuanced descriptions of many quite divergent sorts of pontiffs. A satisfying volume for a wide audience.
0,This book has some interesting facts.  It is entertaining and fun to read.  I would recommend this book.  Also, check out, Strange Stories Amazing Facts which was the book that got me into these.
0,The book for review is "Simply Grilling 105 Recipes for Quick and Casual Grilling" by Jennifer Chandler.		It is rare I review cookbooks but am  glad I took a chance on this one.  The photography in this book is amazing almost good enough to eat off the page.		Majority of people love to grill, whether it be inside or out.  This book is amazing. The instructions are easy to follow, the ingredients are simple and what you get is a product that the whole family would love to eat.  It opens up the world beyond hamburger and hot dogs. The variety of foods mentioned gives a whole new meaning to the word grill.		Sections branches out to pork and fish and all the way to appetizers, vegetables, salads and desserts. Yes desserts! What a concept and I am loving that.		This book most definitely stands on its own in comparison to others of its kind. I received this as an ebook and need to go get a copy in hard cover. This will definitely add different dimensions to the phrase, "Mom, what's for dinner?"		As someone who collects cookbooks as a hobby this will add to my shelf. Jennifer thank you for creating this book.		I received this book for free in exchange for two honest reviews.
0,Great book about American's (especially artists, scientists, medical personnel, etc.) who spent time in Paris in the 1800's when Paris was the center for learning.  An interesting perspective of life in Paris during that time period.
0,I cannot begin to understand the heartbreak she has survived but survived she did, keep on believing and talking to God.
0,Brown reveals that shame is an American  epidemic from which few escape. Overcoming shame and shaming behaviors just might be the next great human evolution. Brown treats her subject with compassion, humor and well grounded scholarship.
0,*received an ARC for honest review*	If you read S.L. Scott's Kingwood Duet, you met Jason Koster as one of the characters in the supporting cast. Jason was the star of the football team in high school. He fell in love with Delilah Noelle and they were inseparable... or so they thought. Delilah and Jason are torn apart by lies and live their lives in different directions following the heartbreak. Years later, Jason comes back to his hometown looking for peace from life on the road and recent crime and violent experiences that he has found himself in. After helping his mother and reconnecting with old friends, he can't help but be drawn to the one that got away, Delilah. Delilah has a past that is volatile, but she is willing to try again with Jason and this time around they need to be open and honest with one another. But when they are tested by outside forces, will they defeat it and find solace at last or will they be torn apart.... AGAIN?
0,I look forward to more by this author. Never a dull moment. Just when you think you know where it's going there is a new twist.
0,Good price.
0,For the most part this was an excellent book.	It doesn't go quite as far as I would have liked.  I was looking specifically for information on creating a menu system with the DOM.
0,Penny has captured all the joy and sorrow in life in this story. Her perceptions are spot on. Another homerun.
0,This is by far one of my favorite personal finance books for young professionals. It gives a pretty succinct recap of the basics of personal finance ranging from loans, investments, and credit cards alongside other information. My favorite part is the fact that it includes info on robo-advisors for investing such as Betterment and Wealthfront, and has a lot of comprehensive charts and other information. Even though the book targets women, I'd argue that it has useful information for everyone as a general 'modern guide to handling one's finances'. I took off a star for two reasons: 1) it seems like a lot of the direct book links don't work - i.e. the ones that are supposed to lead to the book's website and 2) the Kindle version occasionally cuts off the larger charts.
0,Keeps your attention throughout the book.  Romance and mystery intertwined smoothly.  Unique mixture of "Big City girl" and rural cowboy.  Would advise if you want a good reader.
0,I really enjoyed this book, but didn't care too much for the ending.  It had a good plot that will hold your interest.  It is a fairly light read,  would be a nice beach or plane book.
0,The best book that I read and enjoyed this year..
0,These are a great series of books.  Humorous, fast-paced, well-developed characters.
0,Love the series!
0,All these five books are great. It is a very easy and nice read, and extremely interesting.
0,I LOVE this book. It's very humorous and shares an important lesson. I recommend  this book for all ages. I think every kid should read it.
0,Everything was great! Book was in excellent shape. Came super fast. I am very pleased with the book and its quality.
0,Great story
0,Book was good but it reminded me of a 3 hour movie than should have been 2 hours.
0,Really gripping read. Couldn't put it down. Another good read from Joy Ellis.
0,Out of the corner of your eye, you see something. But when you turn your head to look at it full on, there's nothing there. Thousands of times people see glimpses of the "unseen world"; a shadow in the corner, a light seen briefly where there wasn't any before, or even hearing voices in the night that no one else can explain. Holly Silverstone discovers the things she saw when she was a small child were in reality things from the "unseen world." A place where Holly discovers magic, mystery and bravery she never thought possible. A world she can't quite grasp and struggles to understand. Daisies changing to butterflies, shimmering doorways, shadows and voices....	Jay Ellis ensnares us in a magical web of storytelling where we find that those things that go bump in the night are really there but can only be seen in his unseen world. 2 Thumbs up, 5 stars...whatever you like to gauge your book reading by, Jay Ellis' "Shadows and Voices" is incredible. This is a book for reader aged 12 and up.  I personally cannot wait for "Gold and Smoke", the next book in Holly Silverstone's magical education at the Highlands Academy by Jay Ellis.
0,The reason this book isn't just another diet book and is really helpful is because its purpose is to train us to take our mind, our thinking, and examine our thoughts by the light of God's word. It trains us to then take those false thoughts one by one and find the biblical truth that will transform our minds, renewing them to line up rightly with truth. Herein lies hope for change, because it's acknowledging God and His word as our source for help.
0,I enjoy knitting cables and this book is full of great patterns. I would like to make everything in it
0,This is perhaps the most thorough, most comprehensive, and most damning account of the Nixon administration's behavior regarding Watergate that will ever be done.		Where others have had to rely on either some amount of speculation, assumption, or hearsay, Dean's effort benefits from his first-person perspective, along with meticulous research and near-fanatical dedication.		At times the book becomes almost too dense and (as others have noted) occasionally repetitive.  However, Dean is not attempting to write prose or create a narrative so much as almost a legal-academic dissertation within an historical political biography.  And Dean brings a lawyer's tenacity to providing the facts - regardless of what they are or whom they may affect.  And although he does provide some context into choices and actions - both those involving himself and the major players in the Nixon administration (Nixon, Haldeman, Erlichman, and Mitchell) - taken during the growth of the scandal to try and help the reader at least have a sense of understanding why things were done, he never even attempts to excuse, justify, explain, or re-frame them.  The result is a book that is at times a bit difficult to read, but one which, through using the actual words of Nixon and his conspirators (including Dean), is completely captivating because of its candor, and one that actually draws the reader in to the inner circle of Nixon and his men. Easily the closest thing to actually being in the room as the crimes mounted.		True, Dean does allow himself to suffer a bit of self-indulgence by constantly repeating praise and compliments others have for him (at times a bit too indulgent), but waxing effusive about how clever and able Dean is in the handling of the caper also serves to show just how far into the conspiracy everyone is. So much so that further conspiracy and felonious actions (obstruction of justice, suborning perjury, etc) is met with vocal approval.		In the end, The Nixon Defense confirms the worst fears about the level of corruption and mendacity within the Nixon administration.  Discussions regarding criminal behavior, subversion of the democratic process, and disdain for ethics and decency happen with the same cavalier attitude that most people use when considering whether they should have chicken or beef for dinner.  It's clear that from almost the outset the president and his top advisors were complicit in not only the obstruction of justice, but also of suborning perjury and a conspiracy to cover-up a crime.  And as time went on, the felonies just multiplied until the behavior of Nixon and his cronies Colson, Haldeman, Erlichman, Ziegler, etc were so egregious they would even make members of the Cosa Nostra blush.		Ultimately the entire Nixon era should serve as a cautionary tale of the dangers of paranoia, megalomania, egotism, and the need for revenge.  Unfortunately, it may just serve as a blueprint for how not to conduct a conspiracy for future criminals in office.
0,Overall this book is well written, has many twists and turns but has just a few inconsistencies that distract from the overall enjoyment.		During one part of the story an individual is shot in the back with a shotgun from point blank range, but then suddenly is well enough to not only free another character that is tied up, but also well enough to disappear while the house is burning down and surrounded by police. Also the house that is filled with natural gas never explodes, even though it is in flames. This tended to distract me from the overall story as I wondered why an author that spent so much time writing a realistic crime drama would allow this hole in the story.		Additionally there were a few parts of the story where I became lost as to what was happening as the story made a jump from one thing to another with no transition.		With that being said, the characters are believable and overall the story is well researched and the flow of the story smooth. It is well written and the few issues with the story certainly don't detract enough to make me not want to read more from this author. The ending leaves a bit to be desired, but I assume it was written that way as a lead into his next book.		If you enjoy murder mysteries with a few twists and turns I recommend this book.
0,My only complaint with this book is that I wanted more. It took me into the story and made me want to see where the characters went from there.
0,Held my interest right from the first page!  Mystery and romance intertwined beautifully. Didnt figure out everything until the last chapter. Excellent book
0,This book at had so many twists and turns that were completely unexpected. I cried, I laughed and now I want MORE. Truly an amazing author. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
0,I loved the book. All of the books of this family are excellent!
0,Being a lost soul in the sense that I have no idea what to do with my life, Dan Millman gives some insight into what drives my ambitions, interests, strengths and weaknesses.  This is a very interesting book that should be shared with friends and family, not necessarily as a roadmap for one's life, but as a guide to seeing what your life (and others like you) could be.  It is also great as a spooky "hey, check this out" item to use with your pals.
0,Part 1 is the story of Leander Jordan, a fifteen year old boy who doesn't give himself enough honorable credit for the the man he is about to become. Leander joins the Union army but gets injured almost immediately and sent home. In this first half of the book, the reader gets a slice of Leander's home life, friendships, rivalry and hoped for love, and the devastation of war- the lives that are lost, and the lives that go on.	Part 2 is the story of young Paul Settles. Paul attends to Leander in a makeshift Union hospital. When Leander is sent home, and Paul's father dies, Paul rejoins a troop, but too soon ends up captured and confined to Andersonville Prison.	Secondary characters that know both Leander and Paul are threaded solidly throughout. The author does a fabulous job with twists and turns that made this reader gasp with glee.	Twenty pages of an Author's Note, with original photos of the prison and soldiers, plus a selected bibliography will satisfy questions brought up in the book, especially of the layout of the tents and the "sinks" (latrine).
0,I originally purchased this in South Africa written in Afrikaans as a souvenir for my young'uns and we loved it enough to want it in English, too.  It is extremely fun and "gross"-ly educational for all of them - from the baby all the way up to my husband.  The mouse runs into several of his friends and they peek inside each one's diaper to find poo and, in this way, you learn about different animal feces.  Fun, right?  Then you can see that the mouse has a dry diaper because he went in the potty, which paves the way for potty-training all his friends (and your kiddos).  My boys request this each night and the toddler opens each diaper while I read...and we all laugh.  It just doesn't get old.  So, if you have boys in the house that love poop, I'd recommend this book!
0,A great read!!
0,Harry is always a delite.  Connelly has way with words.
0,AWESOME book, well written can't wait to read next book in the series.  I we would definitely recommend this book.
0,Excellent Book
0,I count Lee Child among my favorite authors and was eagerly awaiting "A Wanted Man".  So eager that I chose to purchase it for my Kindle rather than wait to get it at the public library where I volunteer. Reacher is a super hero and is right up there with Mitch Rapp, Elvis Cole, Joe Pike, Lucas Davenport,Kurt Wallander,Dave Robicheaux and Scot Harvath all of whom really enhance my love of reading.  Perhaps this venture by Jack was not quite as good as some of Child's best but it was right up there in plot twists and superhuman efforts.
0,Received my copy today.  I sent my daughter a copy too.  Everything I read was true....one sided...medium paper....great detail....love the peace signs,butterflies, flowers throughout book.  Many hours of coloring anticipated.  I deal with depression.  Coloring is a great coping skill...A must buy for owl lovers and collector's.
0,I'm sure I am not the (intended) targeted customer for this book, but I enjoyed it a great deal.  As a mixed media artist, I am far more apt to spend money on art books, rather than coffee-table decorating books....and, no offense, I am not a "follower" of Ms. Moss. But the premise of this book resonated with me, and I was curious to see how other creative people use their visual archives to prompt ideas and prime the creative pump.  One of my favorite "spare time" projects is organizing the visual flotsam and jetsam in my studio (from the ridiculous to the sublime) and creating Idea Binders.  "Color", "Ethnic Pattern", "History of Costume", etc.  Any time I want a shot of inspiration or a creative jump start, I flip through one of the binders and the ideas tumble out like ball bearings. This book provides a fun look into the creative idea files of a savvy decorator/designer, and the fact that the book itself was designed by Doug Turshen assures that the subject is presented with style, elan, and spot-on elegance.	For many reasons, I was happy to add this book to my studio library.
0,James Patterson is one of my favorite authors and this was a very suspenseful story.  I especially like the Cross books.
0,Quick read. Funny, and entertaining. I felt that the characters were developed, and that the plot was strong. Other characters in the story were interesting enough to want to see their stories also.
0,When the topic of community organizing comes up, a single name comes quickly to mind: Saul Alinsky. Alinsky is often cited as the founder of the field, having made his name through a hugely successful campaign on the South Side of Chicago in the 1940s. Two books he wrote, Reveille for Radicals (1946) and Rules for Radicals (1971), cemented his reputation nationwide. During my own brief experience as a community organizer in the late 1970s, Alinskys methodology dominated the field, largely through his writings. Yet another man, working in the fields of California, much closer to me in Berkeley, was compiling a record to rival and perhaps surpass Alinskys. He is the subject of an excellent new biography, Americas Social Arsonist: Fred Ross and Grassroots Organizing in the Twentieth Century.		Community organizing in rural California		After brief periods as a teacher and social worker, Fred Ross found his way into community organizing through a series of posts with the New Deals Farm Security Administration. As the manager of relief programs in a series of migrant camps set up to house the Okies made famous in John Steinbecks classic novel, The Grapes of Wrath, Ross became familiar with poverty at its worst. During World War II, Ross worked for the War Relocation Authority, which managed the relocation of Japanese-Americans to internment camps throughout the West. In Cleveland, as the Los Angeles Times pointed out in its obituary, he was credited with persuading defense plant owners to hire [thousands of] Japanese-Americans, who were then freed from the camps to work.		Following the war, Ross played a leading role in establishing the Community Service Organization (CSO) in South Los Angeles. Under his direction, the CSO registered the thousands of Latino voters who were instrumental in electing Edward Roybal as the first Hispanic to serve on the powerful L. A. City Council. With a vision much larger than local politics in L.A., Ross then set out to take the CSO statewide  and, he hoped, ultimately nationwide. However, that effort foundered once Ross and the organizers working with him left for other towns. Local CSO chapters, typically led by working class Mexican-Americans such as farmworkers, quickly fell under the sway of Latino professionals and business owners. These more affluent officials were unwilling to support the radical policies that the organization had been founded to pursue.		Enter Cesar Chavez		Though organizing CSO chapters brought Ross to the towns and cities of California, his passion centered on the plight of the Mexican and Mexican-American farmworkers who made California agriculture the envy of the world. When he met a twenty-five-year-old named Cesar Chavez in San Jose in 1952, Ross career began to shift away from urban California to the fields where thousands of poverty-stricken men, women, and children picked the fruits and vegetables that made the states powerful growers and packers wealthy. Chavez and Ross began a decades-long collaboration that led in 1958 to the establishment of what became the United Farm Workers union (founded by Chavez and Dolores Huerta). As Thompson writes, When they met, Chavez would later say, Ross had been about the last person I wanted to see. Then he started talking  and changed my life.' Ross, the consummate organizer, remained steadfastly in the background through the many years of their work together.		Today, the United Farm Workers (UFW) is a faint shadow of the powerful union it was from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. Much of the blame for the unions decline must be laid at Chavez feet: he was a brilliant leader but a disastrous manager. At one point, Thompson points out, when asked to name the people who reported directly to him, Chavez stopped counting at fifty-eight. This number is an order of magnitude greater than what business experts call the span of control. Then, in 1976, against almost universal opposition from everyone around him, Chavez insisted on forcing a measure to be placed on the California statewide ballot to permit organizers to enter the fields so they could talk to farmworkers. When the measure failed by a vote of two-to-one, Chavez began the first of several purges of union staff, demonstrating a pattern of behavior that can only be called paranoid. (Thompson didn't use the term; thats my interpretation.) Chavez also brought a destructive cult called Synanon into the union, with predictably disastrous results. One of Chavez colleagues explained to all who would listen: Cesars gone nuts.' The unions power quickly deteriorated, and eventually the UFW retreated from the fields and became essentially a lobbying organization. Today it relies on direct mail rather than farmworkers dues.		A balanced portrait of a man		Americas Social Arsonist paints a picture of a supremely talented and driven man with a litany of personal faults. He was intolerant of those he trained who lacked his passionate commitment to organizing, and many disliked him as a result. (As Thompson notes, As an on organizer, Ross was endlessly patient. As a trainer of organizers, however, he could be merciless . . .) Twice married and the father of three children, Ross was rarely at home. Though he was indifferent to the discomfort of poverty, that was not always the case with the members of his family. Only his younger son, Fred Ross Jr., came to know him, and only because he began working with his father in organizing at the age of sixteen. (Fred Jr. has himself become a world-class organizer. As Executive Director of Neighbor to Neighbor in the 1980s, he led a campaign around the country that helped persuade Congress to cut off U.S. aid to right-wing forces in Central America.)		About the author		Gabriel Thompson is an Oakland journalist who writes about labor and immigration. Americas Social Arsonist is his fourth book.
0,A great book. She gives you great background on victim personalities. Hard to put down. And to think there are people that oppose death penalty. They're crazy.
0,Larry King gives a wry, funny insight into the writer's life and his own experience.  Some of it is hilarious, as in the Hollywood producer who tries to get him to write a story for free.
0,Agent of Byzantium presents a plausible alternative to the actual history of the Mediterranean region based on "what if" Muhammad hadn't founded Islam with enough action to make a good yarn.
0,This is a wonderful read. I have spent a good bit of time in the areas in which this novel is set (hiked to the top of Montsegur last summer) and feel she captured the beauty and mystique of this region. Excellent story, well-written, captivating characters, very effectively captures the Cathars and their persecution. As a former history teacher, I also love the fact that this novel brings to life a fascinating time and place and corrects wide spread misrepresentation of these fascinating people - Cathars - and presents a much more accurate portrayal than the Church-dominated versions more often told. As is the case with excellent historical fiction, history comes alive and breathes!
0,So simple and elegant. A journey of voice and how to search the weathered caverns of your being to find that voice. That Sybilesque menagerie of schizophrenic characters lingering in the dark recesses.  Searching the alleyways as the murmuring voices rumble in your inner soul until that perfect one, the one which resonates not with your heart but with the soul of the character who lives in.  The character who yearns for freedom and to be heard.
0,I have loved every single boo, Katherine Logan as written and you will love this one too even though time traveling is not involved but that does not mean it is not coming down the pike.  Fun, fast reading, you will enjoy, great summer book too.
0,It has been quite awhile since I read a book that I was anxious to get back to every time I had to put it down to do something else.  Like eat, sleep, or leave the house.  But ELIGIBLE was one of those books for me.  I've read all of Curtis Sittenfeld's books, and this one is my favorite, thus far.  I will admit, I've never read the real Pride and Prejudice (but I've seen the movie a number of times so knew the plot).  Even so, I liked the retelling of the story in a modern way and had a good time comparing it to what I know of the real Pride and Prejudice.		The characters aren't all likable.  That's okay though because you aren't supposed to like Kitty and Lydia very much.  They are supposed to be annoying and immature and vulgar.  Mary was the mystery.  Jane and Liz the ones you wanted to come out on top.  Sittenfeld did well developing these characters into the modern world.  As the story moved on I was anxious to see how the relationships between Jane and Chip as well as Liz and Darcy would turn out.  I needed to know what would happen next to the Bennet family.		The Cincinnati setting was most appropriate for me and brought the story together in a way that felt comfortable and interesting.		Bottom line:  I just really enjoy a good story and this one was just that.
0,This book is a simple one. It gives the second grader a chance to get the basics of math. However if your second grader is advanced in math they will find this math book a little boring.
0,This is a book I would recommend for all book groups to read. The discussions will be really deep due to the nature of what transpired in this story. Tom is a lighthouse keeper. He marries Isabelle, takes her to live on Janus with him. Isabelle suffers 3 miscarriages. One day, a boat washes up on shore with a dead man and a tiny infant girl. Tom has to report it via signaling to his superiors, but Isabelle convinces him to wait a while before he reports it. The events that happen next tug at your heart and soul.  It makes you question yourself, what would you do? I literally couldn't put this book down. I learned a lot about lighthouses and what some of the people in Austrailia are like. When our book group discusses it I"ll be giving it an A.
0,Great "read". Interesting topic.
0,Well written narrative of the long journey of MDMA to become a more acceptable form of therapeutic treatment for PTSD.  Succinct and informative history of psychedelics and the vilification related to abuse and fear-mongering by those who don't completely understand this powerful set of substances.  I couldn't put this book down and devoured it in just a day and a half.  I'm not convinced that it is the default form of treatment, but certainly it should be an option for those who cannot seem to cope with traumatic memory.
0,Delivery was good and the book was very helpful.
0,While this is a good story, its far too short on details. Since the writer has created an entire life of gods and sacrificed 21 year old virgins for money it would be more helpful to explain more. We find this Guardian and the future sacrifice having sexual encounter and then its 3 days later with a plan along with others involvement. ??
0,Read China in Ten Words first.		This book is good, with wonderful stories and insight into China. However, China in Ten Words is a much pithier, better read. This doesn't have much value added over China in Ten Words, and felt outclassed in comparison.
0,Best WWII book EVER!
0,I read this series when it first came out decades ago only in paperback .. I'm a re-reader of my favorite books and my original books are falling apart so finding the series compiled into 2 volumes was terrific!
0,I loved your Prime Chronicles series so I thought I would try this series as well!!!  I am so glad that I did!  It was every bit as good as your other works!  Can't wait for more.  I have bought all of the rest of the series that is available so far.  Can't wait for more to follow!
0,Liked seeing Detective Warren somewhat sidelined.  That premise alone makes the novel worth every penny.
0,I don't even remember how I ran across this book but  glad I did.  Definitely a page turner!
0,The Dream Machine deserves many more than five stars.	Mr. Waldrop provides a valuable synthesis of several important perspectives:	(1)  The development of personal, interconnected computing from its fundamental roots in academic and corporate scientific thinking, conceptualization, and experimentation;	(2)  How the vision of one man, Professor J. C. R. Licklider, played an important role in nurturing the development of this form of computing;	(3)  How creating a computing community that frequently shared ideas in-person and on-line accelerated the development of the technology and the society it served; and	(4)  How the contributions of the major and minors players fit together to bring us where we are today.	Whenever I read a book about the history or current state of computing in the future, The Dream Machine will be valuable for helping me put the observations into context.  This is true despite the fact that I have been doing consulting in this industry for almost 30 years, and had early access to many of its important innovations.	In fact, if you only read one book about computers in the next two years, The Dream Machine should be that book.	As valuable as I found that framing of the development, I was even more impressed with seeing how to foster fundamental human development through this example.  Professor Licklider was trained initially in psychology.  From that unusual perspective on computers, he quickly perceived what humans can do better than computers (make judgments, fine distinctions, and decide what order to do things in) and what computers can do better than humans (make difficult calculations, remember lots of things at the same time, and rearrange mountains of information into new forms of order).  He also foresaw that the full exploitation of these combinations would have to come from playing with a responsive computer that did your bidding during real time.  Although he knew that the costs of such would be prohibitive for many years, he helped encourage first time sharing and later software protocols that would bring the experience to as many people as soon as possible.  Although he was not alone in his perception of all this, he was unique in his dedication and influence in bringing it all together through a long career as an academic and business researcher, visionary leader, professor, mentor, and twice head of ARPA computing activities in the Pentagon.  His life should be an object lesson to all about how much difference one can make through bringing the right people and resources together to work on the right questions.	If you are like me, you will find reading about Professor Licklider to be one of the most moving experiences you will ever have from reading a combination of history and biography.	Some will complain because the book relies primarily on secondary sources.  I found that foundation in books and stories I know well to be its strength.  There is an enormous amount written about the history of computers and key people.  How it all fits together is what I needed, not a new theory of what happened.	Having been in the middle of or next to much of what is described here, I also came away with many new perspectives on where computing should go from here.  In essence, this book succeeded in transferring Professor Licklider's vision and perspectives to me.  Having seen how profound his vision has been, I can only hope that this transfer will take place for many people and coming generations through this outstanding book.	I should note that for those who are not technically oriented this book is easy to read and understand, even though it is about a technical subject.  I was also impressed that the personalities of the various pioneers in computer research came through loud and clear.  Many of these people are known to me primarily through their accomplishments.  I was glad to find out about them as people.	After you finish this wonderful book, I encourage you to think about where you have a unique vision for how to improve the world that no one else understands or is as committed to as you are.  How can you advance that understanding to the benefit of all?	Take a long, hard look at how we can come closer to our potential as humans!
0,Good Series
0,Love Perry Stone books.
0,A very good story well written. The words flowed together. I could hardly put the book down. Try it you'll like it.
0,I just finished the entire series, and I loved each book.  The crossovers with the Divine creek books were wonderful.  I suggest you read them in order, or you can read them out of order, but I like how the author builds the characters as she goes.
0,I always love a good read by Mr. King, and this book did not disappoint. Full of twists and turns, Revival left me wanting more. Once again, hats off!
0,The Magician's Nephew by C.S. Lewis is a wonderful beginning to The Chronicles of Narnia.  Two children, Digory and Polly, are given a great gift by Digory's uncle.  He gives them rings which give them the power to  travel to different worlds and travel home again.  They travel to many  different worlds and have many different adventures.  I one of the worlds  they find an evil queenwho follows them back home.  Polly and Digory take  the the queen to a different world where they meet a kion called Aslan and  many different talking animals.  Digory takes a silver apple back home to  his dying mother.  When Digory gives the apple to his mother and she is  miraculously cured.  Digory plants the apple core and magic rings in his  backyard.  You will have to read the rest of this magical adventure to find  out where the magic appears next.  This book is one of the most wonderful  and magical books I have ever read.  Lewis's imagination really keeps the  books alive.  It makes you feel you are sharing the adventures right along  with the characters.  I would recommend this book to anybody because it is  so fascinating.  This adventure-fantasy is for people of all ages.  It  makes you want to keep on reading to find out what happens to the  characters.  There is a lot of suspense and it is very absorbing.  I love  the way it leads into the next book of The Chronicles.  It makes you want  to read all the other books that follow.
0,Love the story.
0,Excellent transaction. Received timely and in advertised condition. I would do business with this seller again.
0,Stephanie is over her head as usual.
0,Deliciously gory! Well paced and intriguing,  I'm ready for part 2! Seriously creepy moments  with enough suspense and bloody guts to keep me glued to my screen.  Recommend!!
0,When I started reading I wasn't sure I would finish it. Then as I kept reading it got to where I didn't want to stop reading; however, I had to get sleep. I thought the ending brought the story full circle.
0,I'm agnostic but wanted to learn more about Christianity and this is a very interesting way to do it.
0,This book is just plain good.  Good to read, good to learn from, and good to find out the worst or best people running our country and our lives.  I thought I knew everything about the Clintons and the Obamas but Blood Feud has really brought me up to date and leaves me more disturbed than ever regarding the fate of our country with people like them in charge.  The book reads fast because  you just can't put it down.
0,Good reading from an interesting guy.
0,So this was the last book in the King series and I re-read the other books to be sure I was in the right mindset. This series was captivating from the first few pages in book one, so I was sad to start The Ten Club, knowing it was the last I would read about these characters. The books have always been non-stop action and twists that keep you guessing.		Ten Club starts with a bang. Mia, King's wife and mother of his son, learns that he is alive and chases him down to find out what happened. She is shocked to find that he doesn't remember her. She knows she should stay away and let his brother Mack go through with his plan to end King and Ten Club, but she can't give up on him. And this starts a breathtaking story that includes the past, present and future. King has very dangerous plans to rule the world, and his family are torn between ending him or trying to redeem him. The twists and turns are fast and furious, but not unreasonable. Answers come just as fast. Pamfiloff is a master at keeping track of mythology, keeping it detailed, but simple to follow.		While Pamfiloff does an excellent job bringing the new-to-the-saga reader up to speed, I would recommend reading the other books first. There is a lot of paranormal elements that she does so well, but there is also warmth and humanity.		There has been a lot of talk about the ending. It is unexpected, and some may have found it unsatisfying. Me, I loved it. I enjoy not knowing where Pamfiloff is going, and being happy when she gets there. It's not a traditional HEA, but one might argue that it's exactly what Mia expects. After all, she knows King has never been a saint, but she loved him anyway. And Mia does have an ace in the hole when it comes to keeping King in line. You will just have to read the book to find out what that is.
0,Anthony Beevor is a marvelous war historian, who puts together  a fascinating overview of the various theaters of war at the different stages  in the war and of the widely differing leadership styles in the conduct of the war.  The author has provided a most interesting	account of the  political background to most of the strategically  important decisions taken during the war by the various leaders and has also highlighted  the strengths and weaknesses of many of the generals involved and in all theaters.  What makes this book such a tour de force is the author's  ability to describe in detail the experiences of the front line soldiers and the horrors of war, no matter where.
0,The Denarians. Fallen angels battling the Knights of the Cross. Nicodemus is the leader and the best bad guy in the entire Dresden Files series. In this book, the Shroud of Turin goes missing and Dresden is hired to get it back, only to wind up working with the Knights of the Cross and Johnny Marcone to stop the Denarians from ending the world. All while dealing with his vampire ex-girlfriend coming back to town and a duel to the death with a top official of the Red Court.		Here is where the series starts to really, really, really shine. And this comes from the fact that Butcher has multiple plot lines in his books at one time. Rather than focus solely on the investigation, Dresden is forced into a myriad side situations that help develop him and the other conflicts and story arcs of the series. It keeps the books exciting, fast paced, and action packed.		Butcher's writing has gotten extremely refined compared to earlier novels and his pacing is much better. It's a fun read that really manages to capture everything I love about this series. It also has Michael in it, and Nicodemus, which makes it about a hundred times better than any of the others.		On top of that, it introduces a bevy of characters we'll grow to love later on. Molly Carpenter, Butters, the Denarians, Kincaid, and Ivy. Ivy and Kincaid are awesome characters, and Ivy especially is hilarious and scary at the same time.		Overall, an excellent addition to the series.		Books (from my favorite to least favorite)	1. Death Masks	2. Summer Knight	3. Grave Peril	4. Storm Front	5. Fool Moon
0,it is a good reference for me as a substitute teacher
0,This series is so freaking fun! I loved this book so much. So many laughs, so much sexy, and the girl power is to die for. Brooke's writing is so fluid and keeps me engaged from beginning to end.  If you haven't check out this series, do it. It just gets better and better.
0,Entertaining story!
0,I love this man. He is cocky, and filthy, and protective, and soooo schmexy! Any woman would want this man to love her like he loves Emmy! Exceptional story about love, and acceptance, and heartbreak all in one!
0,CAPTAIN BARBER, PFC CAFFERETTA AND LT. COLONEL DAVIS -MEDAL OF HONOR HOLDERS ALL ...IF YOUR A FORMER 'JARHEAD' YOU WANT TO GET THIS BOOK!	SE,PER FI
0,It was exactly what I was looking for..small and compact.  A-Z with numerous pages in each section. At the back of the book are some very useful sections:  Internet & Computer Information, Home Network Settings, Software License Numbers and 5 pages for notes. I wanted this to complete and put it in my safety deposit box in case something happens and my daughter needs access to my computer.
0,Used this for a project my freshman year, and was a great example to show the kids that came to visit!
0,This is the great and very interesting book to read. So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)
0,I really enjoyed this book, though it's not one I wanted to sit down and read at one time. I read it each day and got something out of it every time. Robin writes about a personal story and then compares it to that of a Biblical person. I know there are a lot of books that do the same, but this one stood out to me. Robin writes with honesty and she included some great verses and sayings that I will need to copy and print out. Honestly, this book came at just the right time and the following verses and quotes I needed to read.  I highly recommend this book!		"I received this book from Booksneeze for free in exchange for an honest review."		Grace: (noun) a manifestation of unmerited favor.		Victim: (noun) from the Latin Victima, a live sacrifice.		"I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." Jeremiah 29:11		The great thing with unhappy times is to take them bit by bit, hour by hour, like an illness. It is seldom the present, the exact present, that is unbearable. -C.S. Lewis, Letters to an American Lady		Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin. Zachariah 4:10		Godly people do not fear bad news; they confidently trust the Lord to care for them. Psalm 112:2,7		[To forgive is to] set a prisoner free [and] discover that the prisoner was yourself. -Lewis Smedes, Forgive and Forget
0,I'm not sure my sixteen year old "Loves" this book but it is required for her AP Physics class this year.  Hopefully it will help!
0,Interesting concept with most supernaturals living under the humans radar in towns that are spelled to keep humans from realizing they are there. These towns also house the supernatural prisons, which are meant to remain hidden, even from the town folk, unless you are on the town council or work there.		Jessa is a powerful wolf shifter, expected to take her fathers place on the towns council in the shifters position in three years when she turns twenty-five. Her best friends are the Compass brothers, a set of quadruplets (only 1 other set is known to exist) and each one is a different type of supe; vampire, fey, wizard and dragon shifter. They took a vow long ago to never share a kiss or anything sexual, valuing their friendship more than risking having a relationship go sour. The Quads are very powerful, and protective of Jessa, and also expected to take council positions in three years.		Her world is turned upside down when her mother, who she doesnt remember, comes back to town and she finds she has a sister. The reason her mother left to begin with and what it all means shakes up much of what shed always believed. And this seems to be the trigger for other events that take place.		I love the relationship Jessa has with all of the Quads, although being picked up all of the time is kind of weird. She doesnt believe she has a mateyou don't know until you at least kiss or have sexbut you get the idea that one of the Quads, Braxton, would be hers. And being in a position of power also comes with those who are jealous or want to take you out.		We get action, emotions, humor and some intrigue. I cant wait to find out what happens next as they try to prevent a war.
0,Love all the Tucker series. Wish there were more!
0,I like this book - a lot - and I read it (as is my annoying habit) in one gulp. It has everything a book (that I like) should have, kept me guessing, kept me interested and glued to my bed (which is, believe me, a tad difficult) and I hear it calling to give it another go, which I most certainly will do in the near future.	Hope there's more where this one came from.
0,This was hands down the most sexual, hot , sensual dark erotic book.  BUT,,, I thought it was already dealt with in the first 2 books. Maybe part of the book for a sexual balance,, because of Mercy remembering who she was from her amnesia. I guess I just wanted to know more about who the heck this Abraham character was. There was so much to build a story on with Sades dad,,,, and Abraham. Sade and Kane working together,, to bring them down. I won't give this book any less then 5 stars,,,because,,,it's still AWESOME writing. It was just already done in the first 2. I love Mr Banes style of writing, he's becoming one of my favorite authors. His characters always seem to have both alpha personalities. Having a hubby thats alpha and me. Well,,, it always a recipe for crazy bantering back and forth. Like a war of the type A, personality. Makes me realize how crazy we sound to everyone else.
0,I usually purchase used referential or text books as I am just looking for the material; just bear in mind that the quality description may not always accurately describe the book's condition. Sometimes I feel I got a great deal other times not.
0,He makes an outstanding argument for a comprehensive belief in Judaism, although hid arguments in opposition to those of Richard Dawkins do not necessarily hold water in my opinion.
0,This is the second book in this series and it is as fun to read as the first one. The plot is good. The characters are interesting and the love story is great.
0,The Wizards Way is a valuable read for any business person, someone on a personal quest, someone who has an inkling that theres more, and a person whos motivated to be better in his work and social life. The book lays a groundwork to explore and own the natural and everyday magic we sense is around us.		Tobias Beckwith has collected and collated the secrets of wizardry into an organized, entertaining, reflective, and motivating manual. He shares his how-to path on becoming your own Wizard in both professional and personal life. Thats a tall order and the book lives up to the expectations of the reader who wishes to active these goals.		The author relies heavily on examples and interviews with past and present people whos adopted the wizards mantle. Corporate wizards like Steve Jobs, mythical wizards like Merlyn, spiritual wizards like Gandhi, entertainment wizards like Jeff McBride, and wizards of science like Einstein. He examines these and more specific examples and then provides wizard work at the end of each chapter to help you work on your own to digest, create, and manifest your personal wizardry.		The book is not, however, dull or pedantic. It is filled with fascinating stories told in an entertaining, intimate, and engrossing manner. Mr. Beckwith makes the sometimes arduous task, of becoming more than we are, accessible and enjoyable.		Ive spent most of my life aspiring to wizardry. Partly as a corporate manager and business trainer, partly as a salesperson, partly as a producer, partly as an actor, and partly as an entertainer combining magic with storytelling. So Im familiar with the multifaceted wizards path. What Im saying about this book, is that it will help me to accelerate and amplify my personal journey and goals.		Wizardry is not some new-age-woo-woo path, its about being the best you can, and giving all youve got to your career, work, family and friends, to leave a magical legacy behind. I cant recommend Wizards Way highly enough, its the most important and engaging non-fiction book Ive read all year.
0,Of course, many parts of this book are dated because of the sea changes in the advertising industry. But, the advice and insights in this book remain the foundation by which all advertising evolves. It is a must read for anybody who has a career in advertising or marketing.		A CMO who has not read "On Advertising" because they feel like it is an ancient text is like a Priest who has not read the Bible.
0,Chuck Norris is one of my favorite people, and I really enjoyed reading of his early life and how he overcame the odds. His Christian faith is something all people should read about and know that it works. I was impressed that he didn't try to hide his mistakes, but gave God the credit for overcoming them. The martial arts isn't too bad either. I am a fan.
0,What a set of books. It is hard for me to leave reviews. Because I get tangled up a lot. But here goes. I love Rage, Beast, Lil Vinnie, Miranda And Especially Faith, If I was Faith I would not have survived. She is one hell of a fighter. In this second book After what she went through at the morgue and then hearing Hudson on the phone I would have died from shock right there, Her strength is amazing. The author has written  these Characters personalitie's  perfect.  Even Lara and Hudson as young as they are have strong will's I am about to read book three.  So far these two were awesome on the edge of seat reads. I started reading book 2 at around noon and just finished it at 1"14 am .a.m. it is that good. Thank you T.R.Ragan
0,Really enjoyed this whole series.
0,Dennis is not the showman his brother was, but his brother wasn't the expert Dennis is. Terence was a wizard of words and ideas. (Read Terence and listen to Terence--everything you can get your hands or ears on, by all means.) But you'd be very hard-pressed to find many living souls with the breadth of scientific expertise specifically in these compounds and plants, a Western cultural background and who can seamlessly marry that with a profound, long, deep and non-merely academic understanding of shamanism and visionary plants. This guy is maybe one of a handful on the planet with those qualifications. I would so like to hear more from him in the future about his perspective on the plants & compounds, the ayahuasqueros, his experiences and how to have my own in today's world of ayahuasca tourism and "the guy from Brazil doing the full moon party at Malibu".		Dennis's book was so guileless, and the more moving for it's guilelessness. I do feel I know Terence now more than I ever knew him before (having spent many workshops at Esalen with him in the 90's); more than I ever expected to be able to know him. Dennis's guilelessness is the mirror opposite of his brother's (as Terence himself put it) "dog and pony show". (And what a show it was!)		Don't get me wrong- I am a card carrying Terence fanatic. Adore the guy, still. And of course psychedelics was but one of his topics of interest and thought provocation. But my interest in psychedelics specifically makes me hope fervently for more output from Dennis.
0,I have looked all over for a practical book of egg cleaning. This little volume has everything you need to heal your family friends and yourself.
0,Lost lost and excellent pop references from the 70s and 80s. Guaranteed to bring back summer childhood memories, both good and somber.
0,I am not a big fan of back and forth time changes.  Alexandra Sokoloff made it work better than most and I realize it would not concern others.  This story line  also made me want to bury my head and pretend such horror doesn't exist.......but with breaking heart I know it is reality.  God will eventually bring these monsters made by Satan to justice......until then we can only pray and possibly donate funds to try and help the survivors find some peace.
0,I read this book in a few day's! I read before bed, I did have to switch to lighter material one night! This book falls into the neglect you family book, as in you just want to sit and read and neglect everything!
0,The book is very enjoyable and very easy reading. I enjoy reading about Adam and Bagel. The burglar surprised me and gave the book more suspense! I like the subplot going on in this book.
0,Beautiful set. Love these.
0,A quick read, a factual yet compassionate view of a core tenant of Islam.
0,Full of political intrigue, this period romance with a splash of magic is a fun, light read. I was frustrated by the lack of described intimacy, especially noting the back blurb and the cover, but the book was well written and the romance compelling. The characters had good chemistry and tropes employed were reasonably explored.
0,This book will rip your heart out, throw it on the ground and do do a little cha-cha dance on it. But then it will pick it up and put it back in and you'll be so happy you'll wish you could do it all over again
0,Ty Buchanan is an unforgettable character, probably because his frailties and fears make him very lovable.  A great story.
0,I received this book from the author as an advanced reader not really knowing what to expect, but I was delightfully captivated!		I love history for many reasons.  Connecting with a past that is far removed from our present is an adventure -- learning about the movers and shakers of the day, what motivated them, and how they shaped the world, all of which is a good study for modern people; but perhaps what is most interesting to me about history above all things is connecting with the day-to-day lives of ordinary people who lived and breathed, who had hopes and dreams for life, and who did the best they could with the life they were given.  Christy Robinson, in her forward, states about her book that it is a "history of human beings whose lives are mostly forgotten."  She uses the effigies of long-dead people to try to breath some life into the people behind the stone, saying "it's not about the blank stare of the 700-year-old marble effigy -- it's the reminder of the person it represents."  In her search for each effigy, she, like others who go in search of ancestors, appreciated the connection with these people whose effigies grace the many churches across Europe, taking in the notion that the people whose effigies now stand cold and dark in those places actually stood in those same places at some point in their lives.  The effigies provide a way to wonder about the lives of the people, not just wonder at their tombs.		After a bit of introduction, the book follows a trail of effigies regionally throughout mostly Great Britain, but also onto Continental Europe.  Information is given about the effigies themselves, the detailed information about their locations and condition, but vignettes of certain individuals make the reading very easy and enjoyable.  It's part travelogue/part reference book in a way I have never encountered before.  Robinson has a very easy and casual writing style, easily accessible by the casual reader and more serious history student alike.		I would recommend this book to people interested in history and genealogy as well as anyone planning trips involving these regions to do a similar search of their own.  A lot of time and care was put into the writing of this book, and it is a worthwhile companion for any traveler.
0,This is the fourth book in a series. It compliment the first three. Each book has it's own theme yet keeps the reader reaching for more.	The writer establishes credibility without overwhelming the characters as super human. Each has a significant role in supporting the story as it progresses.	Hopefully more material is available for future episodes.
0,Jeffrey Buckner Ford's narration is one of the best I have ever heard. He is most assuredly the right choice for this audio performance.  I gave this audiobook, five stars, because of his reading.		Moreover, the author has done a good job in creating a story that brings readers face-to-face with the Iranians' nuclear threat against Israel. He does so in a way that involves characters with human interests that on some level we can relate to, so that their plight is mentally and emotionally our plight.		In addition, there is psychological drama as well as tension-filled scenarios involving the submarine, itself.		I think you will enjoy reading this book, especially if you like to see how fiction mirrors such a present-day potential situation of reality.
0,I'm relatively new to the Whiskey Creek Series. I liked this book as a stand-a-lone, and I imagine readers of the entire series would have a more developed sense of the characters and their backgrounds.		I was drawn into Come Home to Me right from the start.  I enjoyed getting to know Presley and Aaron.  I understood Presley's reluctance to spend time with Aaron, her Kryptonite, because she had turned her life around and didn't want to 'fall into' old habits, like falling into his bed. I also understood her intention to protect the life she built with Wyatt and avoid any battles with Aaron.  Having said that, I do not agree with her keeping the fact of Wyatt's paternity from Aaron upon her return to Whiskey Creek. It wasn't an issue only until Aaron relocated, rather it would be a constant issue throughout Wyatt's life.  The deception added to the plot by keeping readers wondering when the s*** was going to hit the fan, because inevitably it always does.  I kept wondering whether Aaron and Presley would ever recognize their emotions/love for the other, whether Presley could elevate her self-confidence when it came to Aaron, & whether Aaron would be able to recognize his feelings as more than jealousy and lust and make a commitment to Presley (& Wyatt).		I loved Aaron's persistence in trying to get Presley to realize that she wasn't the only person who had changed & grown since they parted.  I really enjoyed all things related to Presley and Aaron and was glad that they were unable to deny their love for one another by the end of the book.		The problem I had with the book is the storyline with Cheyenne seeking to deceive Dylan in the worst manner possible.  I prayed that Aaron would not agree to her plan.  I expected Aaron to back out once he knew Wyatt was his son and had run through the rollercoaster of emotions from having been lied to about his being Wyatt's father.  I really loved the rest of the book, but for this sub-plot which made me very uncomfortable, I had to drop the rating for this book to 4 stars.		Brenda Novak is a brilliant story teller and I am looking forward to the next book in the series.  (I can't wait to see how she is going to keep Dylan from being irrevocably hurt by Cheyenne's actions.)		(I was given a copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.)
0,I love this book.
0,happy about the selection of cards
0,Loved it!!!
0,I enjoyed the book.  It gives a great picture of Johnny Carson, the variety of entertainment deals he was involved with and many of the famous players from the '50's through the 80's.  While the author was there through all of it, I thought he did a good job of being objective and providing the context and information of the events without the stories and descriptions being self serving.  Very much worth the read.
0,Bam!!!  Right between the eyes.... Great book
0,I have enjoyed all of the Stone Barrington stories I have read so far.  This one a little different from the usual mysteries.  More of a	family type and has a pleasant ending. Good reading. I can picture one of the famous English movie actors playing Stone in one of	his stories in a movie.
0,Crazy good book.  I was hesitant from the synopsis but looks can be deceiving.  I love this author's writing style so there was no way I wasn't at least going to give it a try and I'm SO GLAD I did.  I love a good suspense/romance story but this one is not just good it's great.  Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and was smoking hot to boot.  One of the best books, in my opinion, of 2015.
0,Good one
0,Just finished this book.  Truly liked it.  Good story.  Thrilling with alot of suspence.  If you like	good detectives this is it.
0,ROSENFELTS BOOKS ALWAYS EXCELLENT
0,I have now read 4 of the Dragonfire series by Deborah Cooke.  They have excellent characters and they continue throughout the series.  I plan to begin reading the next book in the series tonight.  Enjoyable story lines and plots.  You could do alot worse than read this series.
0,I like having all his poetry to enjoy.
0,this is a wonderful book.  note that i did not buy the tapes, and cannot comment on them; however, my experience with other TY books is that the tapes and CD's associated with them are not well-connected to the book and tend to really suck.  for audio learning, i'd recommend the pimsleur course. (in general, for self-study of a language you really need *both* an audio-focused course like pimsleur and a book to explain the grammar.)		another reader said there is not enough grammar, which is totally untrue.  this book has a lot of grammatical explanations; they are very well-done and well-paced, not too technical but extremely clear, whether you are linguistics-savvy or not.  the book also does a generally good job with its presentation of vocabulary.		the main complaints are those of all TY books: the binding is poor and the books are shorter than they should be.		beware: TY books are completely rewritten from time by time.  there does in fact appear to be a newer TY-Chinese book, so don't assume it's the same as this one.
0,Where is the next book?!!! I wouldn't have read this if I had realized it wasn't in yet. FYI. Great book though, it starts slow then becomes the page turner you're looking for. This book is immoral to say the least so if you can't handle it, don't read it.
0,This was an excellent book! I hadn't heard of the book, but read it with the book club I am in. Fast read and well written. Cant wait to see the movie!
0,This was an excellent story!  I had a hard time putting it down.  I want to see more from this author.
0,Really enjoyed the small town atmosphere and the people that reside there. Colbys character was interesting and believable  but was not so sure of Ians .Enjoyed the fact that he had bought the farm that she had for years imagined herself having and then eventually being there with him.
0,The only thing bad about Sarah's books is that they have to end. I absolutely love her storytelling and couldn't put the book down!
0,Loved this entire series. Each book was riveting on its own, and the plot twists were excellent.
0,I would characterize this as something like Lewis's "modest proposal" for the temptation of mankind. In the epistolary tradition, but representing only one side of the conversation, the letters in question are those of a senior demon, the eponymous Screwtape, to his nephew Wormwood, a minor devil, and represent Screwtape's collected wisdom on the subject of the temptation of human beings from the straight and narrow.		Like much of Lewis's writing, The Screwtape Letters is essentially an apology for Christianity, but unlike some of his other books, Screwtape is funny, sly, witty, and full of sarcastic japes and jests. Of course, it also provides plenty of Lewis's own wisdom (demonstrated "in reverse" by Screwtape, as true a "devil's advocate" as ever there has been).		A very entertaining and illuminating read! Even if you've found some of Lewis's theological writings difficult or tedious, try The Screwtape Letters.
0,Delilah stories by Barry Eisler are great.  She is a Mossad asset.
0,Hopefully, I didn't just enjoy the last chapter in the Breeze Saga. Even though I'm a blow boater, I've spent many an adventurous hour aboard the "Leap of Faith" and hope to spend  many more.

0,A story of a great engineering feat for its period,also a story of rampant graft ,robber barons and their croneys who got it done.
0,Great! Love book movie combos!
0,As usual, Sallis' writing is wonderful, and like Cypress Grove (CG), this is more about who Turner is than the detective challenges to be met.  There are several, and they largely end up tying together.  Turner is a complex and fascinating character with a history of police work, therapist work, jail time, and other life adventures.  The story is primarily character-driven, with Turner's first-person perspectives taking the forefront, but more involvement with the others in his life than CG, his woman Val, newcomer J.T. and those who work with him on the small town's police force.  Nathan and Isaiah, Turner's neighbors of sorts in the woods away from town proper, play interesting roles, also.  The writing and characters' quality leads to the but....  But in this story, there is modestly more violence than in CG, some of which seemed unnecessary to this reader, and the rather unsettling stories from Turner's past, while a part of the telling of who he is, sometimes are downright unpleasant.  If those things are all right to you as a reader, enjoy this.  Will I be looking for Salt River, the next in Turner's story?  I'm not sure.  Maybe when I'm ready for another turn at Sallis' wonderful writing, but maybe another Lew Griffin since I thought highly of Eye of the Cricket.
0,I read loads of books about park rangers, so many in fact that my friends call me a wannabe ranger. One of the things that holds me back from just going for it and becoming one myself is the fact that I'm scared spitless to be in some of the scenarios described here. I have a great respect for these loyal, humble and very very outnumbered men and women. I live very close to the GSM and have often watched the rangers patiently dealing with a variety of situations.	While I will never become a ranger myself, I will always be impressed how well they do when they are so short-staffed.
0,No spoilers here! After reading this book I CAN NOT WAIT for the next series and continuation of these characters story. Casey dropped some MAJOR bombs through out this book and I could not put it down. I felt this was a great ending to the War of the Fae and a great lead in to Clash of the Otherworlds. I am so in love with all of these characters at this point so I can not wait for September.
0,Devon Bandison masterfully weaves powerful trials, lessons, and gifts from his own journey as a father and leader with practical and immediately applicable exercises to help you become a truly present and connected parent. More than that though, he shares the essence of what real leadership looks like  both in the lives of your children and in your everyday life. You now hold in your hands everything you need to be the man you know you are capable of being.
0,If you enjoy mysteries, this will be a good book for you. Twist and turns throughout. The end of the book was a page turner. I like how it was written from each character's perspective.
0,I thought it was very interesting book well written and I really enjoyed it.
0,Such a great story about how we can turn our self-doubt into courage to overcome something that may seem scary or too hard of a task. Jabari goes through that thought process and with the help of his dad he is able to take the big jump. His dad teaches him to take a deep breath and change his self-talk into something positive. I will definitely be using this in my kindergarten and first grade growth mindset lessons next year. Another winner!
0,This book was not what I expected... it was better.  This is my first book by River Laurent and I know I will be reading more of her books.  Cinderella.com is a modern day fairy tale romance story that's sexy, hot, dirty... and a fantastic must read.  The writing is great, the characters are interesting and intriguing, and the story line is captivating.		I volunteered to review an advanced readers copy of this book.
0,Nurture or nature? Trevor Noah went through unimaginable hardship & was blessed with enduring love. This is an amazing tale...
0,Max Collins offers up the best (in my opinion anyway) of his Nolan/Jon series. With lots of music, (Collins is an accomplished musician in his own right) mystery, and suspense he has you on the edge of your seat from the get-go. Jon gets involved with issues from his past and when he winds up in trouble (I won't tell you what kind, you have to read it yourself) Nolan feels the necessity to come to the rescue. The story-line is so intense I could hardly put the book down. SCRATCH FEVER ranks right up there with the best Collins' (including the Quarry and Heller novels) has to offer. A must read for rock fans as well as mystery fans!
0,Ms. Comley has scored another winner with Cold Case. I have an affinity for cold case storylines and this was is a gripper from the beginning. The plot line is tight with a variety of suspects that keep you guessing until the end. The characters well developed and especially our MC, Sally Parker. Not only is she a superb detective but she has issues of her own that never seem to leave her alone. Adding more depth and drama to the story. What I enjoyed the most was the dialogue. It brought each character, good or bad, to life in a colorful and meaningful way.		You can read it as a standalone, but for me, I will have to go get Book 1 and 2.
0,Connie's sense of humor really shines in this one. Quite entertaining.
0,I absolutely loved this book.  The author did an excellent job with her storytelling.  The characters were well developed and the flow of the romance wasn't rushed.  I loved how the characters were woven together.  Even though it ended well I am still hoping for a follow up.
0,Kim Jones you are a ROCKSTAR!!!  I love your MC books and you have blown me out of the water with this one.  I was so wrapped up in this story and these characters. I laughed, I cried and totally wanted to THROW my kindle with this one. But YOU ROCKED THIS STORY.		Be prepared when you pick this one up y'all that you won't want to put it down. This is about Saylor and Dirk and the people immediately around them. Come and check out their story. It's an AMAZING one.		I really can't wait to see what's next in the Sinner's Creed Series.
0,One of the best books I've read
0,Sometimes books with a particular theme are way too heavy on all the theme details, you almost need a dictionary to know what they're talking about. Happily not this one. I learned about different types of wool/fibers, spinning, related tools - all spurred my interest to learn more .	AND .......... there was a good mystery at a fiber festival ...... and a little bit of romance. I look forward to all being there in future books.
0,I was on the edge of my seat  and then the book ended. WTF? I need resolution! Great book, fast read, a different take on the zombie apocalypse, I loved it but I need more. What happens to the family?
0,one of the best time travel books there is! i can't wait to read the second novel and i saw that there would be a third one out soon.
0,I was asked to give my honest review of this new book and after reading the 1st Chapter, I was hooked. The writer draws you right in to this story. The writing was in the 2nd person, and although there are multiple languages smattered throughout the story, it intrigued me. It is a well told story of a farm girl, Maria, as she travails through her journey to join her Mother after her Father's death. Shian Serie has written a good book. There is violence and some disturbing sexual content but it was done in a way to show how difficult Maria's journey to find her Mother, actually was. A sort of discovery of life and all it's hardships, as well as it's joys. I know some languages so the smattering of them did not bother me. There is a translation of all the words used in the end of the book, to help those who need it. This did not detract from the story. It actually enhanced it, as the use of foreign terms, and even some sign language, showed the reader the path that Maria was on as she adjusted and learned as she travels on this journey. I hated the ending... but then I think it was purposeful in venturing on the next journey. I can not wait for the next book in this series.
0,Loved A Promise of Fire so much! The best book I have read this year.  This is the kind of book that I love, the one where you don't want to put down and can't wait to pick up again. I was almost tempted to reread it as soon as I finished. Loved the inclusion of Greek Mythology too. I can not wait for the next one to come out!
0,This is a great resource. I am enjoying it very much.
0,This series can never stop!!!  If you want a fast, fun, sexy read any of the Real Man series will work for you.  Babe and Josephine's story is over the top, hot, and their relationship takes off like a rocket!  Jenika, you do not disappoint.  Looking forward to the Viking.  This book, as well as the rest of the series, is free with your KU subscription, so read them all.
0,Mr sparks does a great job telling these type of stories.  The last song was very good and deals with young love  divorce issues, and even death.  It was a heart warming book.
0,Enjoyed it--just as I have many other Mansell books.
0,This book was entertaining but a bit dark and depressing. You certainly don't get into the book hoping for a happy ending, and to me the main element of suspense was whether or not the local doctor (main character) was going to get a happy ending of his own. I won't give that one away. I was also interested in the setting involving an old, formerly wealthy family, trying to survive the transition to a modern economy. Overall a very good creepy atmosphere if that is what you want!
0,I recently bought this Bible after carefully comparing the text online at the publisher's website.	The "Goals of this translation" stated in the HCSB Introduction are all honorable and I'd argue that they did acheive them. This is an accurate,readable Bible in contemporary English. The study helps are valuable and the accuracy was not compromised due to cultural or social agendas(gender inclusive trend).	The footnotes in this Bible are educational.	A good example is found in the difficult passage of 1 Sam. 6:19 "God struck down the men of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the ark  of the Lord. He struck Down 70 men[out of]50,000 men.."The footnote reads "Some Hb mss,Josephus read 70 men."Study of other Bible versions will show that there are many different interpretations of this verse. The HCSB has a sensible rendering of the passage.	This is not a "study" Bible per se. But the additional helps were a surprise!	Some features that I really like are:	"Where to Turn" is a convenient,helpful section.	The Table of Weights and Measures and the Bullet Notes come in handy also.	The words of Christ in red.	The bold typeface of the OT passages when quoted in the NT.	The use of  "Yahweh" in the OT when the text emphasizes The Name."Yahweh" is likely not the actual name(YaHUaH) but a step toward recognising the importance of The Name is a positive in this translation in my opinion.	Uses "Messiah" in a Jewish context and "Christ" in a Christian context.	The quality of this hardcover binding is excellent,especially considering the very reasonable price!	This Bible is versatile enough that a new student or an older student of the Bible will both benefit from it's use.
0,This was such a pleasure to read, a narrative story that provided a heartfelt description of the challenges Justice Sotomayor experienced in her climb to success.  Her life experiences offer important insight regarding struggles of minorities to succeed and excel in the dominant culture of privilege.
0,Perfect book if you like ocean themed coloring pages!!!  Not too intricate so is nice for beginners.
0,Excellent !!
0,I was super excited to read Pantomime. The problem is, while the story and idea are great, they're not executed as tightly as they could be.		There are so many things I loved about Pantomime. I loved the country of Ellada and want to know more about it. I loved Micah. I loved Gene. I loved Drystan and Cyril. I loved Penglass. I loved the circus itself and all of the characters in it. I could go on and on and I want more.		Pantomime suffers, though, from a lack of a real plot and slug slow pace. The main culprit for the slow pace is the frequent switches between Micah and Gene. The switches also called into the light the lack of a real plot.		Even though the plot was thin and the pace slow, I enjoyed Pantomime. Luckily, Micah and Gene were endearing narrators and I really grew to care about them. Their problem was a very individual one I really loved following and found refreshing. Micah's problems were real and his questions poignant. So, despite my problems, Pantomime is a must-read. It's a book I had to struggle through at times, but the end result was rewarding and definitely worth the time and struggle.		I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
0,This series gets better and better. Adam totally stole my heart with his alpha male attitude and his ability to let Tori rule his heart without her knowing. She may not know that he truly wants her, but she has truly fallen in love with him.		This story is suspenseful, action packed, high energy, and hotter than sin Read. It packed the perfect punch needed to make a 5 star book. I'm very much looking forward Wicked Bite!
0,Loved this book!  I felt connected to both of the main characters and their struggles.  After reading book 1 there was no way I wasn't going to read book 2 and see how the story ended!  I enjoy reading books with a dark theme, and this book did not disappoint!!  Definitely would recommend reading King and Tyrant!! Going to be reading book 3 in this series next. Love this author and look forward to reading more from her!!
0,Good book easy to follow.
0,Have returned to my previous love of yoga; I am a senior citizen and this helps me with strength and balance.  The book has all the instructions and pictures of poses that I need to reintroduce myself to yoga.
0,Not your average fairy tale, it has real bite figuratively and....I can hardly wait as they say for the rest of the story. Will the Blackwood curse condemn Lily and her brother to death?  Great reading, would like to have this author at my next dinner party.  This story will surprise you. I am not related to the author nor did I receive any compensations for this review.
0,It was a good read, however, the story was too short which lead to having to subscribe to the next book.  I hope the next book is a little longer.
0,Reading this book is time very well-spent.  I am fairly realistic and so agreed with a lot of Charles' thoughts.  That being said,  I didn't necessarily see everything his way, but thoroughly enjoyed the constant feast of thought and perspective.  It is very well written and each topic well considered.  I have recommended it already to numerous people and don't hesitate recommending it to everyone.
0,I have enjoyed Glynn's Survey for nearly 10 years. Now his Survey is in it's 10th edition. This is the second edition published by Kregel, the first having been published in 2003.		As I began collecting book recommendations from my pastor, friends, and teachers, I also began searching the internet for recommendation lists. One of the lists I found early on was John Glynn's Survey posted at bible.org (it has since been removed). Glynn's work offers a great format for categorizing and labeling books. He is interested in the level of difficulty as well as the theological viewpoint--two very important pieces of information when it comes to selecting books.		Glynn's method is to collect recommendations from reputable evangelical sources and to consolidate them into categorized lists. For each book of the Bible, Glynn distinguishes between technical, semi-technical and expositional commentaries. He usually adds a section for monographs dealing with special subjects on each Biblical book. He also has a system of noting the theological perspective of each author (such as evangelical, evangelical/critical, conservative/moderate, and liberal/critical). In the introductory sections to the book and each division Glynn spells out his method and criteria.		Along with listing commentaries, Glynn covers reference works, introductory works, theological works, church history works, language works and even Bible software (such as Logos, Accordance, and BibleWorks). Some of his previous reviewers have noted that the Survey bears the obvious marks of Glynn's strengths and weaknesses. This is partly the case because Glynn decided to highlight his own recommendations. While this is a nice feature it truly distracts from his intent to provide a list of books most recommended by scholars and professors. However, it does provide the reader with someone to associate with the recommendations offered which leads to my greatest criticism of this volume (to be dealt with below). In many places it is obvious where Glynn spent the greatest amount of time.		  * In the commentary section the greatest concentration is on the Gospels, Jesus, Paul, and the Book or Revelation.	  * In the Classic Theologies section he omits any reference to Calvin (other reviewers have noted the absence of Barth and Acquinas), and he highlights none of them.	  * He is very heavy in pneumatology, especially Charismaticism; and in eschatology, especially Dispensationalism.	  * The Church History section is a nice start, but leaves much to be desired. You can spot Glynn's predispositions best in this section.		Chapters 19 and 20 have a lot of helpful analysis of available computer resources.	Chapter 21 provides a selection of web sites which is greatly lacking, but a fair start for the person unfamiliar with the many online used book dealers, academic sites, and theological journals. Finally, a very helpful addition to this volume is "The Ultimate Commentary Collection" which is a quick listing of the top 2-4 commentaries for each book of the Bible.		Another feature of this volume worth mentioning is the footnotes regarding forthcoming volumes. Of course, these notes will quickly become obsolete, but it is a very helpful service that deserves being perpetuated.		Really, this entire project is worth being continued. The concept of cataloging the most recommended books is extremely helpful to students and teachers alike. I've read a handful of notes from professors who direct their students to this Survey when they are asked for book recommendations. However, there is room for improvement. Here are a few of my observations:		  1. One of the greatest weaknesses of this volume is the fact that we are not told who has recommended each title. To that, we don't know which books are the most recommended except for the ones highlighted by Glynn himself.	  2. There are very few annotations. I'm not a fan of lengthy annotations, but some basic information about the usefulness of each volume would be ideal.	  3. Glynn only identifies the theological perspective of the authors in the commentary section. Granted this is an ambitious task to begin with. However, similar labeling would be of great benefit throughout the theology section.	  4. This volume is great for listing the most recently published works and is spotty when it comes to classic works. A true "comprehensive guide" would include the best classic works, too (even puritan, neo-orthodox, and liberal works).	  5. A work like this would be most beneficial if it were offered in a searchable, digital format. I would love to see this made available online and/or as an add-on to the popular Bible software packages. Making this Survey available in this way would allow for more room to add extra notations, labels, bibliographic information, author details, etc. Really the sky's the limit.		Of course, there are space constraints and noting all of these features would take up too much space to make this book manageable in print. However, a reasonable compromise could be agreed upon or the project could be printed in different volumes--one for commentaries, one for theological works, etc. The plan of this Survey is great and highly useful for a fairly broad range of students. It is a project that requires constant updating and expansion. I truly hope that Kregel will find someone (or a team) able to take up this project and carry it on through many more editions.
0,The stories in this book are extraordinarily entertaining.  The characters are quirky, but recognizable, and there is some truly laugh-out-loud dialogue.  Mr. Ryan has the keenest eye for nuance, and his stories contain sly and perceptive depictions of his characters' personalities and motivations.  A winner of a book!
0,The Law of Attraction has truly changed my life thanks to the writings of Wayne, Joanne Scaglione and Jack Canfield. They have very effectively reduced the principles of the LOA to practical ways to live it. I have truly found peace, love and joy these past few years using their tools. The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Living-Series-Workbook-and-CD/dp/B001IW9OJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Living Series (Workbook and CD)</a>&nbsp;got me hooked... tools I continue to use.

0,This is a wonderfully inspiring book on how one person came to grips with, and then flourished, with the diagnosis of advanced prostrate cancer. I highly recommend it to anyone who is dealing with a diagnosis of cancer or other life-threatening disease. It will show you how to live to the fullest and leave a legacy by concentrating on what's really important--your relationship with God, family, friends, church, and community. You'll learn how to make your life count, whether your time on earth is short or long.		Get the print version. I love my Kindle, but this book has a beautiful layout with quality printing. it's soothing just to handle it. Get a few copies to give away to your loved ones who are struggling.with serious health issues.
0,P.M. Barnes illustrates the struggle of apocalyptic foot soldiers as she introduces us to an in recognizable world. Claire, a powerful woman who has suffered inconceivable losses comes to grips with a future she never imagined. The end times create unpredictable loyalty, but blood is thicker than anything. Time does not heal. It only serves as a reminder that we are the arbiters of humanity.		Masterfully written, Zombie Seed calls to us to examine the subjective meaning of life in the most basic sense as it is redefined in a new world with no order. I highly recommend this fast-paced book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
0,A great book! Really helped me. Came on time, in good condition. I would definitely recommend it for not only those struggling with eating disorders, but the loved ones of those struggling, as well.
0,One of the best books I have read this year!
0,FANTABULOUS plots and good maneuvering of characters in the plots so that the final outcomes aren't predictable.
0,This is a great book.  I love Nancy Guthrie's approach to scripture application to daily life.  I also love having so many different ways to pray for my kids.  I especially love the blanks where you can insert each child's name.
0,A bit of a romance novel. Good, easy beach read. The book meant a little more to me because it was based in "my beach."
0,Valen "Alamo" Slater has wanted Jasmine Buckley  since he met her, he didn't act on it as the time was not right.  Alamo is ready  to act on it but Jasmine is seemingly oblivious towards his feelings towards her.  Not to mention Jasmine is focused on her business and developing a cosmetic line and is not sure she wants the distraction.		Jasmine has been crushing hard on Alamo but she thought he liked her best friend, she could not have been more wrong.  As they begin exploring the attraction they have for one another, Alamo finds himself rescuing his sister which puts Jasmine in harms way.  Alamo is going to protect his woman no matter what and the more he has gotten too know Jasmine the more he knows she will be staying by his side no matter what.		Another page turner from Piper Davenport.  What I love about this series is you can visualize the characters and the the way the story unfolds.  Loved Alamo, he is gruff but not where Jasmine is concerned.  Loved everything about this book.
0,Exceptional reading keep you interested. Good story line  make you want to read the next book to see what happens next
0,Interesting story about a woman wanting to live her life her way, but meeting resistance every step of the way.
0,I would have given five but she threw in everything including the kitchen sink.  By subtracting one subplot the story would have read better.
0,I bought this book because it was good value. Having worked through it I have to say that Rosenthal is a lot smarter than I am and I had to look at other sources to fill in some of the gaps in his proofs. The book covers a lot in 200 pages and this is at the expense of detail. One thing that frustrated me was the exercises with no solutions. This is a good book but you are going to need some additional sources to work out wtf is going on at times.
0,I actually read The Seventh Scroll first, so already "knew" Taita from the scrolls. Here this clever slave tells the story of early Egypt through his writings. Wilbur Smith's style is, a always, so good and so easy to read, I couldn't put the book down.	From the very first 'play' that Taita has re-wriiten, and the results of that, to the fighting against the Hycos which had horses and charriots! to the very last, where Taita's queen and love has died, this book kept you in suspense and as you learn  more about the people around Taita, you also learn to know him better and even start to love him a bit.	I'm sure there must have been someone like him in ancient Egypt.	I am not sure how much of this story is based on facts, but it certainly read like a great historical novel. Because of these two books, I have started with the 'Courtney" series, and fell in love with that family just as much as with Taita.
0,America's Greatest Depression is a timely book for the year 2009.  All too often this era of bloated wealth, excess spending, and the prurchase of homes by many who should have never changed their renter status creates the belief this year is the 'worst of times' and it is not.  It could become this with government interference.  The volume serves to discuss many facets of the 1930's era and reading it would benefit the baby boomers.
0,This is the life story of a true master who has shape his life through his dedication to martial arts.	 I found it captivating with lots of hints about what is the spiritual side of karate. "Karate my Life" is more than just a life story; it is a message for anybody who is trying to get to the heart of karate.	Thank you sensei!
0,This is a real nice addition to the Katharine Briggs books. Loads on info on the fair folk. Katharine Brigg's books are becoming scarcer , it seems, or are simply being made reference in libraries. I'm rather fortunate to have been able to read them when they were still widely available. Well, no matter. Morgan Daimler's book is wonderful and resourceful.  Anyone interested in the good folks will want to read this.	I received a free Kindle copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for a fair review.
0,I like this author's style of writing and the way the story line is built up. The author has done a good job of building the suspense. However, I only gave it four stars because people seem to be turning into "living dead" type creatures which is just not my thing. For that reason, I decided to read only the first book. The author may be doing a great job of carrying on the story line, it is just something I do not prefer to read. It involves a medical mystery, and having worked in medical, I often find myself at odds to how and why the "sick" behave. Some of my family members might enjoy this kind of book, I prefer something that is more realistic.
0,I subscribed to Ramit Sethi's email list for tips about starting a home-based business and making money. His tips are timely and written in a friendly, no-nonsense style that is both easy to understand and possible to achieve.		Same with this book. Though it was written with millennials as his intended audience, I as an older woman found his tips to be timely and manageable. This is the first book that I have actively used to begin to improve my financial picture, and though it will take longer than the six weeks he promised, I am committed to take as many as the steps outlined to improve my financial story.		Read the book. You'll be glad you did.
0,Great information for a healthier dog. Shipped quickly.

0,I enjoy highland stories but they can be very good or very bad. This one was very good. The characters were well written. There were a couple times i wanted to slap the heroine for just being stupid. But I got over it. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
0,My sons favorite book!!
0,Due to work obligations, I wasn't able to read for awhile and boy was I anxious to get back to this book!  The will they/won't they attraction with Alex and Aidan continues and it just tears at your heart.  Then along comes Seth, who seems to be showing a softer side toward Alex, but are his motives true?  Alex continues to go through heartache as a tragic accident happens that made me want to cry along with her.  All while the council is out to put Alex into servitude so she would be less of a threat.  And did I mention the Furies?  Looks like the Gods are planning to make their appearance known moving forward.  So many emotions, twists and turns.  This book will keep you interested from start to finish.
0,I truly enjoyed reading this author - there was just enough romance and excitement throughout the book that had me reading it in one day!!!

Grescham Machen and the Crisis of Conservative Protestantism in Modern America</a>&nbsp;is an excellent study of the man and his theology.		The Authors Preface to this 1937 book states, This book constitutes the second part of a series of radio addresses which the author has been delivering over station WIP, under the auspices of Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia. The first part,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Christian-Faith-in-the-Modern-World/dp/0802811205/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Christian Faith in the Modern World</a>, dealt with the authority of the Bible and with the Biblical Doctrine of God. The present volume deals with the Biblical doctrine of man, including the related subjects of the decrees of God and predestination The book does not pretend in the slightest to be original. It is dependent throughout upon the masters of the Reformed Theology---particularly upon Charles Hodge, A.A. Hodge, B.B. Warfield, and Geerhardus Vos Its several chapter proceed in logical sequence and seek to develop one central theme. (Pg. 11)		In the first program, Machen says, One point, at least, is clearwe cannot trust the Church. The visible Church, the Church as it now actually exists upon this earth, has fallen too often into error and sin Well, then, is there anything at all to which we can appeal? Is there anything at all that remains constant when so many things change?... The world is in decadence, the visible Church is to a considerable extent apostate; but when God speaks we can trust Him, and His Word stands forever more We can find the Word of God in the Bible (Pg. 13-14)		He observes, But unbelievers will not accept the Bible record of Jesus as a whole. Very well, then, I will say to an unbelieving friend: Here is a New Testament. Take it and choose any passage in it that you will in order to prove that your view of Jesus is right. You do not like my passages. Well, let us see what your passages say. (Pg. 18-19)		He states, the choices of Gods will are always determined by the ends which His infinite knowledge and His infinite wisdom place before Him. A denial of that view of the will is sometimes represented a though it were in the interests of freedom But a little reflection will show that the exact opposite is the case. If a mans choices are not determined by the ends that he has in view, but simply by meaningless oscillations of his will, then they are determined by nothing but chance and the man becomes the mere plaything of something external to himself. That is particularly clear in the case of  God. If Gods choices were not determined by the holy ends he has in view then His actions could only be regarded as dependent upon a blind meaningless chance No, we must really hold to a sound determinism when we think of the will. The will of man is not free in the sense that it operates independently of the feelings and the intellect What we call the will is just the whole person making choices. (Pg. 28-29)		He explains, I do take some things in the Bible literally and some things figuratively But I have a perfectly good way of deciding which things in the Bible I shall take literally and which things I shall take figuratively You see, I hold that the Bible is essentially a plain book. Common sense is a wonderful help in reading it I submit that if a man really reads with ordinary good sense and good will those utterances in the Bible where the Bible speaks of God as repenting of the things that He has done, and the like, he will have no difficulty whatever in seeing that those passages are mot emphatically not to be interpreted literally and that a literal interpretation of them is a very heinous exhibition of misunderstanding and bad taste. (Pg. 32-33)		He argues, If God does not know what His creatures, including man, will do, then a wild, unaccountable factor is introduced into the universe Can we hold that although God does not know what the persons He has created will do, yet He can go on governing the rest of the universe in an orderly fashion? Surely we cannot hold that at all God, moreover, on that view ceases to be God. He becomes a being who has to wait to see what His creatures will do; He becomes a God who has to change His plans to meet changing circumstances He becomes a finite being Also very unsatisfactory [is that] while God does not determine or foreordain the actions of the persons whom He has created, but leaves their actions to the operation of their free will, yet He does know beforehand what their actions will be this form of the theory does not really overcome the difficulty the trouble is that if God really created these personal beings, knowing beforehand what, if created, they would do, He did really determine their actions. Their actions were certain before they did them. (Pg. 37-38)		He points out, Why is it that some men are saved? Is it because of anything they have done? Is it because they are less guilty in the sight of God than others? The whole Bible is concerned with denying that According to the New Testament, as according to the Old Testament, those who  are destined to salvation, are chosen to form Gods people, not because of anything that they have done or would do, but simply because of the sovereignty of Gods good pleasure. (Pg. 54-55) Later, he adds, the doctrine of predestination  does not mean that Gods choice of some men for salvation is arbitrary or without good and sufficient reason---mysterious though the reason may be to us. It does not mean that God takes pleasure in the death of a sinner; it does not mean that the door of salvation is closed to anyone who will enter in [But] the doctrine of predestination  is really the only solid ground of hope for this world and for the next There is no  possibility of bread in the mighty working out of Gods eternal plan. (Pg. 67)		He asserts, in our day miracles have ceased. They have not ceased forever; but for the present day they have ceased. There is a good reason why they have ceased. But though miracles have ceased, certain other supernatural acts of God are wrought every day, when men and women are born again by the mysterious creative work of the Holy Spirit that the Bible calls the new birth. (Pg. 113)		He states, the real decision as to what view is to be held about the origin of the first man is not reached by a consideration of the evidence adduced by biologists or geologists as a matter of fact the decision is reached on the basis of other kinds of evidence Is there a God, Creator and Ruler of the world? Is He free to enter  the world that He has made?... If a negative answer is given to these questions, then no doubt the evolutionary view will be held regarding then origin of man. The biological and geological evidence obviously does not of itself justify such a view On the other hand, to the person who does not share those naturalistic presuppositions, that leap from the actual evidence to the evolutionary hypothesis will seem to be a reckless leap indeed Such a person will say with great confidence, not that man is a product of evolution but that God created man. (Pg. 123-124)		He suggests, The materialist explains that connection between physical processes in the brain and thought-processes in the mind by saying that only physical processes exist and that what we call the mind is only a very intricate form of physical process. The explanation is quite absurd, when you come to think of it. But why cannot the connection between brain processes and mind processes be explained equally well just by saying that the mind makes use of the brain as its instrument?... No doubt the relation between the mind and the brain is a great mystery But there are many mysterious things which yet must be accepted as facts. So with great confidence we can accept the teaching of the Bible  that man had a body and also has a soul, and that  both do most truly exist. (Pg. 135-136)		He asks, Does the doctrine of the imputation of Adams sin to his posterity mean that the descendants of Adam, though themselves good, yet suffer the penalty of Adams sin? Does it mean that good people, because of what Adam did so long ago, are treated by God as though they were bad, suffering many miseries in this life and the pains of hell forever? No, indeed, it does not mean that at all. On the contrary, every person who suffers the penalty of Adams sin is also himself bad. Indeed, badness is necessarily involved in that penalty itself. (Pg. 217)		He explains, [The doctrine of total depravity] does not mean that all men not Christians are at every moment just as bad as they possibly can be.  On the contrary it is perfectly consonant with what is also plainly taught in Scripture---that the Spirit of God, by His common grace, restrains even unregenerate man from the full manifestation of the power of evil the dominates them it means  that the corruption of fallen man affects all parts of mans nature. His faculties remain, it is true; he is still a man, and as being still a man he is responsible. But all his faculties, all parts of his nature, are vitiated by the corruption into which he has fallen The whole life of man is corrupt the Biblical doctrine of total depravity means that nothing that fallen and unregenerate men can do is really well-pleasing to God. (Pg. 241-242)		Machens presentations of doctrine for a more popular audience (more so even than his sermons) are an excellent presentation of Reformed doctrines.
0,A Father's Story by Lionel Dahmer is a harrowing account of a father trying to come to terms with the murderous crimes of his son. It is a story that brings us to the limits of belief in its descriptions of how a little boy became one of the nation's worst criminals. It is a true story that makes us ever cautious of our own children as they grow up in the modern world with all the influences that can lead children astray. But more than anything, A Father's Story is a warning to all of us that we need to be ever present for our sons and to provide direction and purpose for their lives. Lionel Dahmer is that father and Jeff Dahmer was that son.		From the beginning of Jeff's life we see a traumatic series of events that may have played an important role in molding the violent man that Jeff would later become. His mother, for example, struggled with severe health problems during the pregnancy- nervous seizures and extreme sensitivity to noise- sometimes taking as many as twenty six pills a day to relieve her symptoms. Moreover, the first years of Jeff's life seemed anything but stable. Jeff's family changed homes several times while Lionel worked hard at finishing his PhD. On top of his mother's continuing illness, this time was plagued by arguments between both parents. Indeed stress had reached a peak with Jeff's mother Joyce feeling condemned to spending all her days at home while Lionel spent all his days and sometimes much of the night working in the laboratory. By his own admission, the laboratory had become Lionel's obsession- his focus in life that would cause him to rush home for supper and back to the laboratory with barely a glimpse of Jeff as he played in the yard. With all its comfort and the predictability of its molecular reactions, the lab had literally become a refuge from the unpredictability of family life.		Gradually Jeff Dahmer the boy sank into his own world withdrawing from reality:"drifting toward that unimaginable realm of fantasy and isolation" as his family struggled to deal with its own brokenness. But Jeff clearly yearned for his father. At times he would clutch onto his father with joy sensing the security we all feel when our fathers come to our rescue. But these moments were rare- as he grew into a teenager, Jeff sunk further into his own "quagmire of inactivity" spending much of his time alone in his room or watching television. A different side of Jeff began to develop- a side that was curiously interested in collecting the remains of dead animals. Oblivious to these changes, Lionel could not fathom the depth of isolation that had gripped his own son's life. Indeed in his isolation, Jeff would gradually become an alcoholic turning to the bottle in desperation during his final years at school.		Jeff carried out his first murder at the age of eighteen. His mother had already deserted him, leaving him alone in her house to fall yet deeper into his insanity. Lionel's later attempts to send him to college ended up in disaster. With his absence from class and his ever increasing problem of drinking, Lionel pulled him out of college. With Jeff's unwillingness to work, Lionel finally sent him to the army hoping that the structured and disciplinary life style of the military would change his attitude and outlook. Initially things went very well for Jeff- his father noticed what appeared to be a transformation in attitude and appearance. But this moment of hope for his future came to an end when, three months before his military service was up, he was discharged, again because of his drinking.		Seemingly in desperation, Lionel suggested that Jeff leave their house in Bath, Ohio to live with his grandmother in West Allis Wisconsin. Lionel believed that the affectionate nature of his grandmother and the love that she felt for Jeff would offer the best environment for getting his life in order. Once again this period - which lasted over 6 years- was a time of great hope. Jeff helped out his grandmother with all the tasks and daily chores around the house. And yet free as he was from the safety net that only a father's love could provide, the sinister side of Jeff's character continued to develop unabated. He began to steal, he acquired a gun, he brought strangers back home and he took on a very curious interest in chicken bones which he bought from the store and treated with numerous household chemicals.		After moving out of his grandmother's house Jeff was arrested on charges of child molestation. For this he was sentenced to 5 years of probation with the first year in a work release program.  Deep down, Lionel still believed that the innocence of the little boy that he had known in his son could be rescued, that Jeff's problems were all simply connected to his alcoholism and that with the right kind of psychiatric help his son would return to some level of normalcy and decency in his life. Little did Lionel know of the gruesome details of all that would later take place in his son's house and of the murders that his son had committed. Only later on, following his final arrest and the media frenzy that accompanied the trial of his son, would the sordidness and the perversity of his drift from sanity and humanity become apparent. Jeff had murdered through acts of violence that defy belief.		So ended all hope of Jeff Dahmer's rescue. As his trial proceeded Jeff showed little remorse for his acts. His father began to search his own inner self remembering his own childhood fantasies and nightly dreams as if they offered some explanation for what his son had done and what he had become. He remembered his own desire for control and power and his idea that his PhD would give him that power. As Jeff was sentenced to life imprisonment hundreds of letters, some religious in nature and some from people seeking comfort from Jeff for their own personal problems and life struggles, began pouring in. But it was the search for a cause- for some sort of reason, for a simple explanation- that occupied much of Lionel Dahmer's time.		Maybe it had been Jeff's genetic makeup, maybe his alcoholism and drug-taking, maybe the drugs that Lionel's first wife had taken during the difficult pregnancy or maybe even the violence that Jeff had been exposed to through television. But as speaker and author Robert Lewis suggests, perhaps more importantly than all of these might have been the lack of parental direction that could well have prevented Jeff from simply `drifting away' both as a child and as a teenager. Jeff had lacked the guidance a child s desperately needs. He had been left alone to drift. Dahmer's last words provide a stark warning to all of us fathers: "Take care, take care, take care". Ours is a world fraught with danger. Ours is a world in which we must take care of our own- our sons and daughters- to ensure that they become the men and women God wants them to be.
0,This book is great in a the way that supports the idea that you don't have to spend thousands of dollars on equipment, memberships, and gym clothes in order to get a good workout.  I was already doing some of what was recommended in the book prior to purchase, but in info presented gave me a lot of other ideas on minimal equipment/bodyweight workouts.  As it is, my workouts consist of kettlebells, bodyweight exercises, and running and I spend zero dollars in gym fees.  I will say that some equipment can be purchased, but $100+ kettlebell that you can get many years out of vs 350-1000 dollars per year in gym fees really makes a difference in your budget as well as your self confidence.  To say that I'm in as good shape working out in my living room or front yard as those in the gym surrounded by equipment really says a lot.

0,"Finding Angel" is one of those books that's an instant classic. The characters meshed rather well but held to real life in the little squabbles that any truthful person would admit that they've had.  Once in a while I encountered things that I didn't understand, such as some of the conversations that I felt were fillers, or like they were there to add more depth to the characters.  I  dismissed them, hence my confusion.  The story line was not overly predictable, for which I am thankful for.  It truly was one of those books that makes me wish that it will continue on if only for the characters that I grew to love.
0,This book is easy to read and understand.  I highly recommend it.
0,This book was so good and Killian was just as awesome as his brothers. I am sad that the series has ended.
0,Strong characters and a great story line.
0,My kids love this book! We read this book over and over again!
0,I loved the diversity of contributors to the book - some famous like poet Luci Shaw and Madeleine LEngle and Brene Brown. Some I fell in love with for the first time (Jill Kandel, writing about death).	  This a perfect gift for any woman approaching or past her 40th birthday.
0,I purchase this every year and usually by Wednesday I start to read the Sunday readings so that by Sunday I am familiar with them and I can understand the homily better.
0,I'm am up to date on the series all 18 books I think this is by far the best series I have ever read. Very well put together great story line I loved all the characters of course, However Alphonso and Salang are amazing. Thank You S W Frank for keeping me glued to the book I love your work. and look forward to more .
0,A very odd thing happens when reading Richard Kramer's utterly brilliant novel THESE THINGS HAPPEN: after reading each page there is a reluctance to turn to the next one, as though doing so just might let all the little wonders of the story, the characters, the words, the ideas, the wholly original manner of intermingling the spoken word tattooed into fragments of thought processes or descriptions of place evaporate.  But of course they don't and by the end of the first chapter the reader realizes that every page is just as unique and satisfying, allowing these little technical bits of magic to flutter around the atmosphere as we grow into the story itself.		And what a way to make that story! Kramer's tale is a poignant one: Wesley is a bright young sophomore in high school who is living with his father Kenny and Kenny's life partner (it takes a full book to finally come to a name for their relationship) George in an apartment above the little New York City  theater district restaurant that George owns (with Kenny). Wesley's parents are divorced and his mother Lola has remarried an ophthalmologist Ben and Wesley has been living with Lola and Ben until it was decided that Wesley and Kenny needed to nurture their father son relationship. George, a wondrous character this George, comes from a theater background and lives in that world psychologically much of the time.  He is close to Wesley and bonds more with the boy than Kenny does.		The turning point of the story comes when Wesley's best friend Theo wins an election in school and abruptly announces to the audience that he is gay. Wesley is a bit surprised but accepting and the two boys wonder is being gay a choice and when and how do you `discover' you're gay? The boys decide that the question should be posed to Wesley's father and his lover since they are very comfortably gay - or are they? Kenny is a major legal figure in the Gay Rights movement and George is not secretive about his theatrical/domestic/culinary existence. But when the question is posed, neither Kenny nor George knows how to respond. And then tragedy happen: Wesley and Theo are victims of a gay bashing, a factor that draws Lola and Ben into the arena with Kenny and George and from there  the remainder of the story dissects the lives and thoughts of these characters who discover aspects of their philosophies and feelings about each other in a manner that can only be termed transcendent.		Each chapter is named for one of the characters - Wesley, George, Kenny, Lola, Ben, Theo and an insert from two sidebar characters Jerry and Lenny - and each of these chapters allows that named character to reveal his side of the story. In addition to writing one of the most touching and revealing novels about contemporary people and how we relate and communicate, Kramer inserts passages that are so perfectly sculpted they deserve sharing: George and Kenny - `We don't know each other; we never have.  Knowing is the father of cherishing. It is where it begins, and ends, too.  To allow that is the gift. And it has not, in this time, been given.'  George says to Wesley "But all you need to do is `be, alive. Don't worry about `being' it." and  `Time can afford to be lazy because it has nothing but time.'  and  from Kenny `But you press on; you can't turn away, you face the world not as you find it but as it finds you, because it will. Definitely use that, I think; it's the sort of statement by someone who will one day be assassinated.' and from Lola, `But I always know what I think, I have to; it matters to me. It's what civilized people do.'		But writing this note about Richard Kramer's gift of a book immediately feels ludicrous. Can anyone do justice in commenting on such a phenomenal achievement? Perhaps.  But the only real joy will come in reading this book yourself, not once, but several times.  If this novel is not selected for the major literary prizes of the year, this reader will be surprised. Think Jamie O'Neill's `At Swim, Two Boys', think Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's `Mothers and Sons' or `The Master.'  No, just read Richard Kramer. Grady Harp, April 13
0,very suspenseful and interesting.  Enjoyed it
0,Fabulous romance!!! Romance novels can often be too one dimensional but this one blew me away! The subplot drove the story beautifully and allowed for the romantic element to be organic and not forced. What a wonderful, original and totally unexpected book! I picked it up because it won the silver medal in The Reader's Favorite Awards and I couldn't be happier that I did. I cannot wait to see what the author comes up with next.
0,Very good story.  I had tears at the end.
0,Loved the book. I used to live in Wilmington and and recognize the places mentioned. Made me miss the area.
0,Good Informative book
0,Cute book.
0,Much food for thought and many angles to ponder.  Book truly opens the door for new thinking processes and opportunities.
0,I have read all of Dickens' novels and found them all to be wonderful. But if I have to recommend a starter Dickens novel to anyone I would definitely choose The Pickwick Papers. There is nothing more enjoyable and it is no wonder that this, his first novel, was an immediate hit. The diverse characters and stories, the humor, the keen observations of humanity, and how everything comes together towards the end are all incomparable characteristics of a Dickens novel. But don't read Dickens like you would read a spy novel. Take time to savor the brilliant prose and the beauty of the English language.
0,A lot to agree with, and humorously written, but I wouldn't buy it again at full price... and I love O'reilly
0,The story of Dornan Ross, Vice President of the Gypsy Brothers Motorcycle club,  his father Emilio Ross, Kingpin of the Il Sangue Cartel, John Portland, President of the motorcycle club, and Mariana Rodriquez, slave to Emilio and mistress to Dornan because she was taken as payment for money owed by her father.  Mariana has been protected so far by Dornan and is currently bookkeeping for the Cartel and money laundering and is very very good at what she does.  Mariana has secrets that they do not know and one especially big secret that she tries to keep unfortunately  Christopher Murphy, a psychopath that wants to rape her and is truly a monster and is also a very evil DEA agent on the take for the Cartel knows it and blackmails her.  So much happens in this book including murder, rape, betrayal, a lot of consensual and non consensual sex, human trafficking, drug smuggling, torture, beatings, kidnappings, and so much more.  Many secrets are being kept and many are being revealed.  Emilio is a complete monster, Murphy is the same, there was hope for Dornan in the first book but as you read this book things change.  Mariana has come to love Dornan but so much happens and things have a way of changing because sometimes the darkness wins out and there is so much darkness in this story.  This story ends on a cliffhanger and we must await the third installment wondering how things will turn out.
0,What a great book Amanda didn't hold her tongue for anyone if you crossed her path and made her mad with bad manners you could bank on getting told off and that's how the story of Brady and Amanda gets started all over a cup of coffee at the coffee bar where Amanda worked. Brady was a Texan through and through from his Stetson hat right down to his boots he referred to women as darlin and Amanda hated that word. Their story gets better by the page and I was over the moon when Tiffany came out on the losing end. This book has twist and turns around many corners but that's what makes this book so interesting. I LOVED IT. I voluntarily read this book to give my honest review.
0,Another good book by Patterson!
0,informative...thanks so much!
0,This series is the First I've read from the Author, Rebecca Donovan.  I love them.  They are so interesting, keep you reading. They are down to earth very easy read.  I enjoyed the 1st one. Now reading the 2nd. one.  I hope people try this series. I'm going to read them all and then try some more books from Rebecca Donovan.  Enjoy!
0,I can tell when Im reading a good book, because when Im not actually reading it, I continue to think about it. I think about the characters, as well as the story and wonder whats going to happen next. The Day I Saw the Hummingbird is one of those books. The author, Paulette Mahurin has written a heart wrenching story about slavery in the United States during the late 1860s. I use the word wrenching here in both an optimistic and pessimistic way. There are situations in this story that show great love and sacrifice, but there are also sections that show intense hatred and heartless acts of metal and physical abuse. The world that Ms. Mahirin has created shows the hopelessness that slaves felt as they endured great cruelty and were thought of as property instead of human beings. Hummingbird is a raw and serious novel, which seems a little shocking in todays world, where most folks seem to focus much of their time on getting the latest cell phone or binge-watching shows on NetFlix. A large portion of the US population live a relatively pampered life which is 180 degrees opposite of this story. As you read this book, think about how much food is in your refrigerator, or how many pairs of socks you have, or the last time you ate around spots of mold on a piece of bread because there was nothing else to eat. This story is going to grab you. Its going to cut deep. Itll make an impression. An impression that will reveal to you that no matter which political party a person agrees with, which God they worship or which country they live in, all human beings are people and should be treated with respect and dignity. Hummingbird will give you a new perspective on life, I guarantee it.
0,I met a man who wasn't there.		Summer vacation season is in full swing and Inspector Martin Beck has just arrived in an isolated summer cottage on an island off the Swedish coast.  The very next morning a neighbor rows out to advise him that he is wanted on the telephone.  He is needed back in Stockholm for a meeting with the Police Chief and the Swedish Foreign office.  Beck grudgingly returns for the meeting and is asked to travel to Budapest, Hungary to find a missing journalist.  The journalist, Alf Matsson, has gone missing and the tabloid newspaper he works for has pressured the Foreign Office to search for the report.  Beck has been asked to `volunteer' for the task.  Despite, or perhaps because of, his wife's displeasure (their marriage is not in the best condition) at his departure, Beck accepts the assignment.  In short order he is provided with a full set of travel documents, a brief dossier on Matsson, and a ticket for Budapest.  The only thing Beck lacks is the first clue as to how to locate Matsson.		As the story progresses we see Beck put together bits and pieces of information as he wanders, seemingly aimlessly, through the picturesque streets of Budapest.  Beck is traveling purely as a civilian and soon attracts the attention of the Budapest police force, in particular a detective who may or may not be an ally of Beck. Beck also attracts the attention of what may be either Budapest's underworld or representatives of the Hungarian security forces.  For all intents and purposes Beck is a stranger in a strange land.		As with all the other Martin Beck mysteries in this ten-book series (this is the third in the series), "The Man Who Went Up in Smoke" is rich with character-driven narrative. Beck's character and his relationships with his colleagues and his wife are fleshed out as Beck plods along trying to unravel the mystery surrounding Matsson's disappearance.  The authors, the husband and wife team of Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall, do a nice job of revealing details in a measured pace along the way.  The plot and narrative do fall squarely within the usual police procedural `formula' but that does nothing to take away from the enjoyment of reading the book.  Although the reader may find the ending a bit predictable (I didn't) the real enjoyment of the series involves the development of Beck's character.  As with many good detective series (Simenon's Maigret comes to mind here) the personality of Beck takes pride of place. He is far from being a super hero, is no Sherlock Holmes (who is?), smokes too much, doesn't eat right, and has some troubles at home.  He is appealing because of these flaws not despite them and his dogged determination and his personal involvement in the cases he handles drags the reader right into the story. He works at his job and doesn't and cannot rely on flashes of genius to solve a crime.		The Beck series has been an entertaining one.  I recommend starting with the first book in the series (Roseanna) and working your way in chronological order.  My only fault with the publisher, Vintage Crime/Black Lizard (a division of Random House) is that they do not identify the order of books in the series.  Despite that minor quibble any reader who enjoys Simenon, Eric Ambler, or Boris Akunin will enjoy the Martin Beck detective mysteries.  Recommended. L. Fleisig.

0,During the 1970s I was living in Kansas City,Missouri, while the Greens were conducting their experiments on Yogis at the Menninger Foundation which was then located in nearby Topeka, Kansas.  I really knew very little about yoga,but I became fascinated by the reports about the Menninger Foundation's experiments on the local TV stations. One of the primary subjects of the experiments was a yogi named Swami Rama. [...]		At the conclusion of the Menninger Experiments I will never forget  the way that they summed up the definition of yoga,"Get into a relaxed state and visualize the desired bodily result." Up to that time my total experience with the mind/body effect had been as a competitor in high school and college sports together with being trained by the US Army Rangers during the Cuban Missile Crisis and later attending the US Army Intelligence School at Fort Holabird, Maryland.		I have continued my interest in mind/body training and have since come across demystified  versions of yoga using  similar internal projection and visualization techniques to achieve various desired bodily results such as the use of Isometric Exercises to develop mental, physical, and emotional strength.  Although I can find no connection between him and yoga there was an individual who taught a similar technique to the intelligentsia ot America during the turn of the century named Alois P. Swoboda in a course that he called Conscious Evolution. His course was directed at teaching the individual to develop their internal latent powers to help them adapt to the ever changing Universe. Currently John E. Peterson has authored a book titled "The Isometric Power Revolution" which takes the same approach although directed more toward the development of physical and mental strength.		I would definitely recommend "Beyond Biofeedback" to anyone who has an interest in the power of the mind over the body.
0,Omg I love this book
0,Interesting look at Southern Italian immigrant life in the late 1800- early 1900s. I was draw in by the story. This was a new author for me I would read another of her books.
0,For those dealing with liver disease in their loving dog, this book is a good start.  There is a lot of useful information. The book is very easy to read, and it should be read completely before utilizing it for a diet though. The information on herbs and supplements is especially useful, and something that can be helpful, while putting together a plan for your dog (with your vet).		However, there is some information that is not stellar, like the listing of raisens as a source of potassium...raisens have been known to be a danger to some dogs, causing renal failure and kidney damage.  Some dogs can eat these with no problems, but when dealing with a dog that has liver disease (or any related liver problem), I would not want to chance finding out if my beloved dog is one of those to get renal failure from raisens.  None of the few recipes use "raisens" in the ingredients list, but someone without prior warning of feeding raisens to dogs, may end up feeding them as a snack.  Also, throughout each recipe, the microwave is often the suggested means of cooking.  I am not in favor of using the microwave, since this can remove more nutrients than the traditional ways of cooking (or feeding raw).  The recipes also use ingredients like pasta, brown rice, oatmeal, white potatoes and/or sweet potatoes.  The recommendation for my husky is low grain (less than 25%) and high protein/low fat/less than 50% carbs (including grains) thru his holistic vet and oncologist.  Otherwise, the remaining ingredients look fairly good and easy to find.		Note: my 13 yr old husky (healthy everywhere else and acts like he's 5-6) is having his gall bladder removed & has a small growth on his liver (found via ultrsound).  This may be much different than what your pet is going through.  It's unknown if it's cancer, but liver disease is noted as highly possible from his bloodwork (which is thankfully getting better).		The author does state throughout the book that treating your dog with a homemade diet, supplements, etc... will involve much trial and error; to find what works for your dog.  She is sharing what she believes ended up helping her and her dog.  So, this should be kept in mind, while reading through this book. Overall, the book is well written and should have a lot of useful information that you can discuss with your vet; as well as, some great tips on caring for your sick pet, things to look for (common symptoms) and possible solutions to try. it's not a one size fits all solution for liver disease, but it truly is a helpful read.
0,It is FABULOUS! Read, re-read, and repeat!
0,Mark Tillotsen lives in a small apartment with his extended family in a city that has become the center for refugees. To have the opportunity for additional food rations, he volunteers for rescue operations, going outside of the city limits to retrieve people not affected by the Change. It's dangerous work, as he has be vigilant for The Haters, vicious killers that were once family, friends but now have a single minded purpose to kill the Unchanged. Mark and the convoy make it to the abandoned office building and begin to load people into his truck. The effort is going well until Haters are spotted, swarming toward the office building and the convoy. Soldiers are able to repel the initial onslaught but cannot maintain security as they become outnumbered. Now, it is a race for survival and Mark is extremely anxious to get back to the safety of the city.		The Haters seem to smell the Unchanged. They see the convoy arrive and begin their attack. As they kill, they seem to go into a frenzy, wanting to kill more. Man, woman, child, it doesn't matter as long as the Unchanged are wiped out. Into the fray comes Danny McCoyne. While he is a Hater, he is on a mission. Not so much to kill the Unchanged, but to find his daughter Ellis, whom he knows is a Hater but has been spirited away by her mother, who is Unchanged. Danny is driven to find Ellis. Other Haters want him to find Ellis, as they see the future of their cause to be tied to child Haters, who are more vicious and more focused than adult Haters.		Dog Blood, by David Moody, continues the story begun with his book, Hater. This novel is as suspenseful and well written as the earlier book. Where it differs is the perspective. Starting by focusing on the Unchanged, Moody builds the feeling of dread and foreboding as Mark leaves the safety of the city for the unknown. Adding to the reader's discomfort, Moody is tightly focused on Mark's perspective as The Haters begin their attack. You are drawn in the action, a feeling that is exciting as it is uncomfortable. As the attack continues, you are really beginning to hope that all of The Haters are wiped out and Mark returns, alive, to the city.		Not satisfied with this, Moody shifts the focus to The Haters, in general, and Danny, in particular. Experiencing the attack from Danny's view, it is a totally different battle. I found that this was a really strange feeling; earlier, I couldn't wait to see The Haters eliminated, now, witnessing the attack from a different perspective, you begin to empathize with The Haters. Moody continues this interesting and effective device by shifting the focus of Dog Blood between the two men, until the exciting climax. An excellent follow-up to Hater, Dog Blood is hard to put down.
0,Reviewed by Christina for QUEERcentric Books	4.5 stars		I was thrilled when Imperfect Harmony by Jay Northcote came up for review. Music and a May/December romance? Whats not to like? What I was not prepared for, even after reading the blurb, was the despair in the story.		WHATS NOT TO LIKE?		John Fletcher is a 42-year-old former music teacher. Rhys Callington is a 23-year-old former up-and-coming rock star who now works as a choir leader. Both men have recently lost their partners.		Death Cab for Cutie became a popular band with their song I Will Follow You Into The Dark. This is essentially what John did, followed David into the dark. Although John survived the accident he didn't allow himself to live, and his enjoyment of music was ruthlessly locked down.		Music was something John shared with David, his late partner, and he refused to enjoy music without him. It was part of how they met, braided into their lives and partnership.  After David died John stopped teaching music, stopped playing, and stopped singing. Even listening to music was intolerable.		Then he hears Rhys.		Johns interest is immediately piqued just by the sound of Rhyss voice. Seeing Rhys adds to the intrigue. His bright blue hair, piercings, colorful shirts, and radiant personality all combine to add color to Johns mundane existence and knock down his defenses. John stops fighting the music and joins his neighbor Maggie for choir.		BRIGHT BLUE HAIR, PIERCINGS, COLORFUL SHIRTS, AND RADIANT PERSONALITY		That first choir performance really affected me emotionally. Watching John open to the music while remembering David was almost too much. His guilt, sadness, and the breath of fresh air music brings him all added poignancy to this tragic and beautiful scene.		Rhys intimately knows Johns pain.  He blames himself for his boyfriends death.  They were bandmates, on the verge of making it big before it all violently ended. Rhys tried to mask the pain with drugs, but eventually found solace in music. Not in seeking fame and fortune  that part of his life is past now  but the music itself.		Imperfect Harmony is the telling of two weeping souls finding peace and acceptance of their pasts, and finding balance and purpose for their present, so that they might possibly be able to establish a future.		As I said earlier, I was not prepared for the amount of despair and agony I would feel right alongside John and Rhys. There were times Id put the book down because my heart truly hurt. Davids death hit really close to home for me and even writing this now I have tears running down my face.		The story is not all doom and gloom, though. The author manages to balance the sadness with plenty of laughs. Johns neighbor Maggie is a hoot, and we should all have an elder family member as awesome as Rhyss grandmother.		John being a substitute teacher that Rhyss little brother has had in class is interesting too.*wicked grin*		Oh, and the dogs! Those wonderful, innocent animals create one of the cutest (and, if I thought they could plan ahead and dominate the world, slickest) meetups ever.		Watching as Rhys and John test the waters after celibacy, trying not to act like teenagers with their first hard-ons, was priceless.		YOU ARE GOING TO HURT FOR THESE CHARACTERS.		Jay Northcote does such a phenomenal job with the writing in Imperfect Harmony. You are going to hurt for these characters. Youre also going to love with them, laugh with them, and find happiness with them.		Imperfect Harmony is one of those books that, when you're done, you still feel the pain but also have happy tears in your eyes, a smile on your face and hope in your heart.
0,I love my crock pot and using it makes meal time a breeze even on those super busy days. I am always looking for new recipes and this is full of them. It doesn't give nutrition facts at the end of the recipes but does let you know the nutritional benefits of each one. Great addition to a cook's collection.
0,I've never really given the FF a chance before. Truth is, the FF never really appealed to me. I loved there villains but i couldn't care less about the family. After reading all the good reviews and the news that marvel might drop the FF comic, I decided to take a chance and pick this book up. After reading this book I fell in love with the FF! The art is good, Ive never really had a problem with marvel art. The story is amazing! This is a must buy! Also if you buy this book, you should buy vol. 2, to get the whole story. Respect the 4.
0,I wish there were a more Ali Reynolds books,she is so interesting. I like the way Jance makes Ali come alive on the pages of each book.
0,CECIL'S PRIDE tells the story of Cecil, the lion that was tragically shot down recently.  The pictures are absolutely stunning, and the story with a sad ending is lovingly recounted, with many interesting details about lions and their prides.  I chose it to share with my grandsons, particularly the older one who just turned six.  However, when my daughter and I looked at the book, we both felt that the subjects of preserving wildlife and of hunting wild animals for trophies, are a little too intense for his age.  We have decided to put it on a shelf for at least a couple of years.  I did show the pictures of lions to the younger guy, age three, and read to him a little bit of the narrative.  This book is not appropriate for the ages stated (4 - 8); it probably should be re-targeted for ages 8 and up.
0,Great book. Came as described and was ahead of time. A useful reference for my doctoral research on Spiritual Giftedness.	Thank you.
0,Everything that Father Groeschel has written is excellent in one way or another. Some of his books are more deeply theological or philosophical; some, written as much from his perspective as a world-renowned psychologist, and former teacher at Columbia as from his priestly perspective - require pondering and meditating in order to absorb the teachings. Others - like this slim volume - present his practical spirituality and his almost Zen-like outlook on resting in our trust in God. Half of this book is a fascinating interview, and the remainder is taken from his speaking and writing on the terrible events surrounding his near fatal accident. The reader does come away with a feeling of hope and courage to face life's challenges.
0,It is Yogis best quotes. A great read!!
0,I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book. I thought I would read a couple of chapters of this book before going to bed. How wrong I was because I was hooked from the first page. Bryant and Grace are adorable and the chemistry is of the charts. Let's hope Dori writes about the other LaClaire brothers.
0,A very entertaining read. Enjoyed the character interaction, gentle humor and the no-nonsense heroine,  Amelia Peabody. There is historical interest as well, all engaging an ongoing interest for me to continue reading her subsequent books.
0,Another little gem.  Recommended to me and I can say, I could not be happier than I am with this beautiful little book.  Very educational, and eye candy for the lover/collector of a most beautiful culture and stone, The Turquoise.
0,My two and three year old love this wipe clean books. Great quality and great educational tool. I definitely recommend!
0,Great Book!!!
0,Wow! and more Wow!! Romance and crime. Intrigue at its finest. Great book
0,The book describes the transformation of the protagonist - a young Parisian architect faced with moral dilemmas during the occupation of Paris by Nazis. The plot is engaging, and well developed, the narration depicting the Nazis antisemitic obsession quite interesting.  Altogether the book is worth reading
0,Great arrangements for piano
0,Love what Dr. Aviv has to say. It works real well for me and has a lot of good information.
0,This author is really good and this history of the flood is great.
0,Gladwell writes another winner here. David & Goliath is filled with fascinating stories that break the mold of the expected. I refer to several of this stories often in daily conversation and have recommended the book to several of my friends.
0,I wasn't familar with the author until recently when I met him and we talked. So I decided to give his series a chance and told him I would give him truthful feedback. It wasn't hard to give good feedback because his series was great. I really enjoyed these. I emailed Andy afterwards and asked him to start writing faster so I had more from him to read.		The series brings you into the story, makes you feel like you are there with the characters. You look down at the clock and the night is over.		Great Read.
0,I have used "Simply Scones" for at least 10 years.  I had a B&B in New Hampshire and the guest preferred scones to muffins or coffeecake.  I always made them smaller (dividing the dough into more sections and cutting them in eights) as the larger scones went to waste. You can get at least 24 out of a recipe with three disks cut into eights. My favorite is the "Apricot, White Chocolate, and Walnut Scones".  I use this recipe as a base and add other fruits and flavorings. No matter where I take these scones I get asked for the recipe. I have recommened this book countless times over the years.		The scones freeze well before baking (and after) and I usually make them the night before and put them in the refrigerator then bake in the morning. Frozen scones bake well after sitting out about a half hour before baking. I have been happy with every recipe I tried.  Also have the muffin book by the same authors. That is very good as well.
0,RUNNING SCARRED, by Jackie Williams, is a perceptive, emotionally satisfying, contemporary love story. The physical and emotional scars the characters must cope with give it much poignancy and depth.		Ellen, a wealthy young heiress whose confidence has been battered by her abusive fianc, struggles to reclaim her self-respect and her independence. She purchases a deteriorating chateau in France, intending to restore the neglected old building and transform it into a retreat for wounded veterans and their families. Her brother and several friends, all of whom have suffered severe war injuries, pitch in to help with the restoration.		When she first discovers the chateau, Ellen also discovers its resident recluse - Patrick, an army veteran whose soul has suffered even greater scarring than his body. Blaming himself for leading his command into ambush, devastated by his wife's desertion, he shuns the company of others. Ellen is the first one to see past his scars to the worthy man beneath, and he is drawn to her despite his determination to remain aloof.		Theirs is not an easy journey. There are setbacks, uncertainty, even danger. Ellen's and Patrick's previous experiences have left them quick to fear betrayal and abandonment. Trust and love are not easily won.		Ms. Williams' characters are well-developed and believable, and the supporting characters are fleshed out nicely and add interest, especially David, Joe, and Geraldine. It's very easy to root for these people, who have a full range of human strengths and foibles. My only quibble was with the villain, Justin, who was so blatantly shallow, loathsome, and sociopathic that it was hard to believe sensible Ellen would not have seen through him immediately, much less have stayed with him for years. The beginning of the novel deals with Justin quite a bit, so for me, it was a bit hard to get through. I'm glad I did, however, because once Ellen buys the chateau, the story really starts rolling and is very good indeed.
0,Imagine it!  Zombies in the wild west!  What an exciting mixture of zombies and cowboys!  That is the only world that Red has ever known.  Red and her new family have found shelter in an old fort.  Surrounded by thick walls they don't have to worry about the walking dead outside.  New beginnings and a food shortage force Red and Trace to go salvage for supplies.  With Red's special "ability" they can get closer to the zombies than most people.		Red and Trace soon run into trouble.  Someone from Red's past has not forgotten about her and would do anything to have her back.  They have some tough choices to make, not to mention there are a lot of people counting on them back home.  Will they make it back in time?		When I first started reading this book, I was unaware it was the second book in a series.  It was not until I was half way through that I realized it.  There is enough back story that the book can be read by itself, though I really want to read the first to get caught up on all the action.  The characters are wonderfully written and well liked.  Red and Trace have to go through so much and still prevail.  I also enjoyed the Native American characters we are introduced to.  Aponi, a great healer and her little brother Kitchi, who is destined to be a great warrior.		I am a true zombie lover, I have read all types of zombie genre.  Some great and some not so.  This is one of the great ones.  You can't go wrong reading Angela Scott's Zombie series.
0,This is a required text for my criminology class and I really love it. The information is pertinent and the writing is clear and understandable. Good resource.
0,I don't know about you, but I remember opening up Eric Carle's books and lighting up with joy as I flipped through the pages. When I was a child, my school would often bring in different books of his, and our teacher would let us read them or he/she would read to us. The colorful pictures and variety of animals, shapes, objects, drawings, etc., you can't be disappointed as a kid. All the things that kids love are in his books. I bought Eric's book sets because of my past memories and fondness with them. As of now, I often use them when I teach to children from the ages of 3-6. In my classes, the books are always a big hit. The children smile when they see the pages turn, and they are able to easily remember the numbers thanks to the colorful images. I personally think that everyone who has young ones, or will have young ones, should make this a top priority purchase.
0,A really great beginning for a series as the plague sweeps over the country. Very realistic cant wait for more.
0,This mini book set has been a great addition to our son's Eric Carle library.  They are small, but that makes them easy for him to hold on his own (he's 3) and highly portable for travel.  The pages are a nice paper weight, but the binding seems a little fragile.  We've been using them for 6 months now and they are showing some wear. I'm afraid we might start to lose pages. The print is small, so they require some good lighting to read.
0,A book that reveals the insecurities in us all.  Not everyone goes through life with all the answers and sometimes you will be surprised with by answers you didn't expect.  The writer takes us on such journey.
0,What an incredibly fascinating book! I've been thumbing through it for the last several days and find myself engrossed in the pages again and again.		I am just an amateur to design so the writing style and the simple explanations were perfect for me. The framing of history through the lens of design was perfectly executed and the accompanying photos were appropriately selected to show the concepts discussed. The pages are glossy, the photos sharp, everything you want in a coffee table book with the added benefit that you get to learn so much. Among the more fascinating topics: planned obsolescence. How it used to be that engineers tried to create a product that was durable and well made, but the problem arose that once a consumer bought that high-quality item, they didn't need to buy it again. So in the 20s, they began to rebrand things. Designers replaced some engineers and they began to redesign the exterior of products so that even though it was essentially the same thing on the inside, it was new and shiny on the outside and the new would be fashionable and the old was just a has-been and got tossed in the trash. And thereby our consumer-based economy was born.		I think we're seeing a re-branding now. It used to be a a razor was just a razor and soap was just soap, but now they're repackaged so that men need a specific soap and  razor, and women need a different soap and razor for some reason.		That's just one example of the fascinating tidbits that I've encountered in this book.		Can't recommend the book enough, definitely worth the read.		By the way, I would recommend the paperback because it's a thick book. Even with the paperback my wrists were complaining. I'm sure if I had the hardback I'd have been suffering greatly.
0,It's wonderful to discover a new author who can deliver a well told story with depth and creativity. I totally recommend it!
0,There is something about Kathryn Cushmans books that speak to me. Everyone I pick up draws me in and blesses me, teaches me, in some way. While my preferred genre is usually romanceand Cushman includes a smattering of that in most of her booksany book written by this author makes it onto my TBR list. And Fading Starlight is one of the best yet.		As Lauren Summers struggles to regain her footing after a career-ruining debacle, her faith and determination shine through her interactions with others, her desire to follow Gods leading and work ethic.  Offering a stark contrast to Laurens open, giving nature is her neighbor. Charlotte Montgomery is suspicious of everyone, won't let anyone close, and holes herself up in her home in the gated community. So, naturally, Laurens innocent acts of kindness are seen as calculated attempts at making Charlotte owe her.		The characters in this book created a full picture of Laurens life. Despite a trying past, people came around her and loved her, raised her to love others and the Lord before anything else. While some of Laurens decisions may not be the best, she learns from her mistakes and does her absolute best to make them right in spite of losing benefits for her personal gain.		A story of healing, of letting go of the past and letting people in, Fading Starlight is beautiful and poignant. I highly recommend this one.		***Bethany House provided me with a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest and fair review. All opinions expressed are my own,
0,Although sometimes long winded, I think this book could be the start of a great series.  Although Thornton mission of the book was anti climatic, I believe it was intentionally done to create links into the next book of a series. In my humble opinion, the author now hasten"legs" he needs to build the story into an epic!
0,A very good read
0,I have read the whole series.  I am sorry that it looks like there will be no more Odd books, but I will continue to read as much Koontz as possible before I join Odd
0,Really, really love it!  Got the book from our library.  Then knew I had to have my own copy.  Have read cover to cover (except the recipes) three time.  So easy to follow, so worthwhile!
0,Spoilers Ahead		I freaking loved Razing Grace part one, and part two did not disappoint!  From beginning to end Amo Jones immerses you in the dark underworld that Raze and Millie rule.  Again, the depravity, and evil that encompases the love between Raze and Millie is of the charts hot.  One of my favorite parts of the book was the 6.  I loved getting to know the masked men, and I cant wait to get more of them, perhaps in their own books.		One thing I typically hate in books is the h getting pregnant and taking off without saying a word to the H.  I really cant stand it.  Lucky for me Millies lapse in judgment didn't last too long.		The big bang of the book, was Miles coming back from the dead!  I was absolutely devastated when he allegedly died in part one.  Miles is definitely my favorite!  I just love his fun personality, and how he can go from charming to psycho in an instant.  A Miles book would make my year!  As endearing his obsession with Millie is, he deserves his own woman.		Throughout the book there was heartbreak, redemption, toe curling sex, and MILES!!!  So good!		HEA, duel POV, no cheating, triggers would be death of an unborn child.

0,Amazing gripping story about old Scottish clans.  Love the time travel angle of the story.  A long and epic love story, so hard to put down.
0,just as described  good quality. lots of detailed pics
0,I read this astonishing book in one sitting, and am reading it again. Shepard is notoriously secretive, and these letters lift the veil.
0,I like all of Alan Russell;s books but this one was especially good.  And if you like dogs, it has some of the greatest passages that show the bond between man and dog.  Gideon and Sirius make a great team and a great reading experience
0,I was very impressed with this book. Our family does raised gardens and grows some of our own crops. But, we are always looking for more ideas and ways to increase production, lengthen the growing season, and make better use of the urban space we have. I loved the greenhouse and hoop house ideas. We are getting the supplies ready and will be building in a few weeks. The strawberry garden barrel seems like a great improvement over the green hanging "growing bags" we have bought in the past. I am quite excited to get to work on that project. I found the pictures to be very useful that went hand in hand with very easy step by step instructions for each project. A lot of other DIY books or books along these lines don't have anywhere near as many details or pictures. We have already built a chicken tractor (a lot of time, planning, and hard work... but worth it!)and it would have been great to have the chicken ark directions then. The only thing missing that we would've REALLY liked to see is a DIY project on a SOLAR OVEN.  **I will update and let you know how the building goes when more of the projects get done.**
0,this a amazing about a hero in ww2
0,Loved Lucas! Love how he and Emily got together. I could almost feel how Emily felt approaching him to help her out. The chemistry was there along with the sizzle. Enjoyed book 1 so much that I can't wait to read the rest of them. Keep them a coming, Susan Fisher Davis!
0,The hardships of the 18th and early 19th centuries are depicted in this story in a personal way, that makes more sense than simple statistics can do.
0,A really beautiful book (both pictures and words) for sparking great discussions with children.
0,Paper Hearts by Claire Contreras is a solid 4.5 stars read that I would recommend to anyone who likes second chance romances. Even though the characters from book 1, Kaleidoscope Hearts, appear throughout book 2, it is not necessary to read prior to reading this book.		Paper Hearts brings us the story of Mia and Jenson. Madly in love as young lovers, life tore them apart when Jenson left California to attend college in New York. Knowing how hard a long distance relationship would be, they decided to take a temporary break from each other with the idea that they would reunite again down the road because their love was destined to last for infinity. But life decided to throw another unexpected curveball into the mix when a girl from one of Jenson's class who he had been dating gets pregnant.		Determined to make sure his child will never feel abandoned like he did as a kid, he turns to his best friend and love of his life for understanding and support, but Mia is too devastated by the news and runs without never looking back.		Now five years later, fate brings them back into each other's lives when Mia takes a temporary job for the same magazine Jenson works for in NY.		Jenson, now divorced and in a good place with his career and role as a father, hopes this is his chance to get the only women he has ever loved back.  Will Mia ever be able to get over the hurt she still feels and be able to embrace his daughter that in her mind should have always been their child?		Paper Hearts shows you the importance of not focusing solely on your pain when life doesn't go as planned,  but also the pain the one you love might be experiencing.
0,There are books and authors (very glad for them) and there are BOOKS and AUTHORS..The Last Child and John Hart are in the latter.	Mr. Hart is an incredible writer and keeps improving; breathing life and layers of complexities of life due to experiences we sometimes have to endure and come through; hopefully becoming more enlighten, especially growing up as children....Why I say that as a reader is because when I am moved emotionally by an author, there has been some tranformation in my psyche.	I only review when I am moved by a story. This story is a stunner with true to life insights even though it is fiction. That's how masterful Mr. Hart is..	Thank You Very, Very Much Sir!!! No matter what I will NEVER, EVER GIVE UP!!
0,This is a polished and well-crafted new mystery with Guido Brunetti being as competent and successful as always.  Brunetti becomes a little more phisophical with each new story: his love of history and his knowledge of the Italian political scenario add interesting background to the story.  Donna Leon never disappoints and "By Its Cover" is right up to her usual  high standard.
0,I really enjoyed the journeys that several of the characters in this novella go through to find out who they really are now that they know Christ. For each of them, this involves weeding through their pasts and who they used to be as well as sorting out other people's expectations of them and their current status quo. Asking themselves what they are willing to change to be and do what God wants them to. The characters were fun and witty, and I really enjoyed getting to know them. The bevy of little matchmakers in the surrounding community were pretty funny too. I would love to see more books about these characters, especially Sadie's daughter Mari!
0,Thank you!
0,Very informative book but I gave it a 4 only because I want more pictures especially since a non-expert like me has no idea what the names of succulents are!
0,Bill Hayes' books are like Christmas ornaments - remarkably crafted, original and deeply tied to personal events and milestones.  Insomniac City, his fourth, is no outlier in this regard.  What's new here, beyond the shift to New York City, is the feel of the near-present.  In his previous works, particularly The Anatomist, the past is as much a character in the narrative.  When Hayes reflects, it's usually to a far distant past (his own or someone else's).  In Insomniac City, however, the cast of characters is diverse and shifting, with O(liver Sacks) and I (Bill) serving as a balance and heart for the book.  From other reviews you've heard about the touching death scene and periodic table, but don't miss the first confession of love from one to another.  Recommended for most readers.
0,Great advice for a single mom if she is raising a son on her own!
0,amazing and.  blew my mind.  made me choke up.  this woman is 1000 times stronger and braver and more wild than I could ever be.  I didn't want book to end.
0,Love this book! I lived in Miami for ten years, so I can testify that all the crazy events that happen in this book truly are possible there.		Dave Barry builds and maintains suspense while delivering the story like a stand-up comedy routine, loaded with rich irony, snarky Floridian sarcasm, and outrageous occurrences. "So, this guy walks in wearing a only a shirt, and it's on the wrong end, and part of him's peeking out the neck hole." (My paraphrasing here.)		There are life-threatening situations, some political intrigue, Bridezilla moments, animal shenanigans, obligatory illegal aliens, desperate road trips, and mogul-life-changing culinary discoveries. There's "adult language" and "mature scenarios" used throughout, so it may not be for absolutely everybody, but it sure is a grown-up good time.
0,Tante Lulu travels to the Navy Seal base in Coronado to collect Cage and take him back to Bayou Black in Louisiana to care for his grandmother whose dying of cancer. While home, he reconnects with the love of his life that he'd lost years ago. Neither are willing to risk their heart again. A whole team of Seals are brought into Bayou Black undercover to investigate a suspected terrorist attack plan for Mardi gras. Cage's story unfolds. Tante Lulu gives out two more hope chests and puts together another musical dance performance by the Le Deux family. Great read with a lot of humor. Tante Lulu's a hoot!!!
0,Nancy Kincaid draws you into her novel with vivid passages and dialogue that will have you laughing out loud.	Her main character Lucy embodies all emotions of the 60's south with an understanding wise beyond her years.  It takes you from her mothers' idealistic naivet to her stepfathers' racial undercurrents and her forbidden crush on Skippy the colored boy from next door.	This novel touches on important social issues without being preachy, yet managing to entertain you all the way.  Crossing Blood is important reading and if I were a high school teacher it would be required reading.
0,I loved everything about this book. She story was not only told in a great way but the meticulous way it was written shows true talent. This was my first book by Ms. Bellerophon but it sure won't be my last.
0,Helpful info on bird feeding and particularly types of feeders.

0,Impressive book! At times I was laughing so hard I had to wipe my tears away! Id be happy to be Tommy Wiseaus friend. There would never be a dull moment! xD
0,One of my absolute favorite Heyers. The books was laugh out loud funny at certain points. Definitely a spunky lead female that is very different from the rest.		SPOILER: She has her "enemy" kidnapped and stashed in a cellar at one point.
0,3.5 interesting stars		Elsa and Paul have, when they were in their fifties, decided to buy a pensione in Naples. The year was 1931 right before the war years would set in. Elsa and Paul were German Jews who eventually became Italian citizens. The story of life in Italy at the time of the rule of Mussolini is told in this book written by their grandson. He uses Elsa's words to tell of the times that people were going through with the rise of Hitler and the hatred that seemed to spread across Europe for the Jews.		This was a tale of adventure, of meeting people through the pensione, of eventually being able to come to America after many harrowing experiences. Living in Fascist Italy, Elsa and her family see the changes coming and once Hitler comes to power those changes did not bode well for Elsa, Paul, and their children. The children were able to come to America, but the road for Elsa and Paul to do so, was fraught with many difficulties.		Through all of this Else remembers and cherished the people and friends she and Paul made while owning the pensione. Her Italian neighbors embraced them, but of course the writing was on the wall where Jews were concerned as Mussolini aligned his country to Hitler and the war.		Ralph Webster has told a loving stoy of his grandmother and the trials and joys she lived through. Elsa embraced her life, loved her husband and her children and their children and lived until the age of ninety-eight.

0,The 1941 Anglo-Iraq War is considered a small sideshow of World War II. At the time the British thought that the Germans and Italians were making a play on the Middle East via Iraq that would threaten its entire eastern empire. The Iraqi government and military thought that the war could force the British out after it had dominated the country since its creation after World War I. For Berlin, it saw a way to extend its hand in the Middle East against a greatly weakened London. Iraq and Germany didn't believe their actions would lead to war, but it resulted in a short, but violent conflict that pitted British, Iraqi, Jordanian, German, and Indian troops against each other.		At the start of World War II Iraq was part of Englands oil concessions and was a way station between east and west. Petroleum was produced in Kirkuk and shipped to the Mediterranean, and Persian oil went through the Shatt al-Arab waterway to the Persian Gulf. There was also the Habaniya air base in western Iraqs Anbar province, which protected those interests and was a stopping point in the trip to India. Iraq was no longer a British Mandate, but London still played a dominant role in the countrys politics, economy and military.		That caused resentment amongst young Iraqi army officers who turned to pan-Arabism as a solution to English imperialism. Four colonels came together and became known as the Golden Square and threw the militarys weight behind politicians they supported and overthrew those they opposed. In 1941, they backed Prime Minister Ali Rashid al-Gaylani who shared the Golden Squares anti-British sentiment. Germany and Italy were also actively courting Iraqis at this time via its ambassador in Baghdad Dr. Fritz Grobba and meetings in Berlin and Ankara. London took this threat seriously and tried to remove PM Gaylani from office. That led to a coup by the Golden Square in April 1941 that put the premier back in power. Gaylani and the Golden Square read the headlines and believed that the Axis powers were going to win the war, thus offering Iraq the opportunity to escape the hegemony of Great Britain. The Axis were looking for openings in the Middle East to weaken the British. Neither actually believed that this would lead to armed conflict. Both thought the British would withdraw due to their losses in Europe and North Africa. England on the other hand saw this as a serious threat not only to its hold on the region, but one that could isolate it from India, the jewel in its crown. This set the stage for the Anglo-Iraq War.		Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to remove Gaylani and return a pro-British government to Baghdad. A small British force from Palestine and the Transjordan Arab Legion were sent to reinforce the Habaniya base, while the 10th Division from Indian landed in Basra under the Anglo-Iraq Treaty. Iraq responded by asking the Axis for aid and air support, and cutting off the flow of oil from Kirkuk. The Germans sent two squadrons of fighters and bombers to northern Iraq via Syria which was under control of the Vichy French as well as several trainloads full of weapons and ammunition, which ironically were never used. Even then, PM Gaylani did not want war. He demanded that the Indian forces move through Iraq for Palestine as quickly as possible, and sent troops to surround the Habaniya base hoping to pressure the British there to depart as well. The fighting started at the beginning of May when the British bombed the Iraqi forces outside Habaniya and Baghdad. The war then went through stages. The British were able to beat 9,000 Iraqi troops in Habaniya using air strikes. The British and Jordanian forces then moved east for the Battle of Fallujah towards their final destination Baghdad where they were to meet up with the Indian units moving north from Basra. Several times on this march German planes were deployed against them in air strikes. Gaylani and the Golden Square ended up fleeing. The English then moved onto Mosul and then Kirkuk, which eventually led to another campaign to free Syria of the Vichy. Everything was over in a month. Gaylani and the Golden Square failed to free Iraq of British influence, but their effort led to a war they didn't want. Germany was not looking for a fight either, but did send military aid to an Iraqi military that didn't seem to have a real plan, which helped lead to their defeat. England came out victorious and subdued what it thought was a serious move by Hitler that could have threatened Transjordan, Persia and ultimately India.		The Anglo-Iraq War is little known and Iraq 1941 does a good job not only breaking down the short conflict, but providing some background to what led to it. There is some great art work and some photos of the units involved as well. The book does focus upon the British forces more than the Iraqis and Germans, but it is a quick and easy read, and there is a bibliography with some good suggestions for further reading.
0,Bought as Christmas gifts for grandchildren and they loved it.
0,This is my first baking cookbook and I love the receipes and pictures. There are some strange ingrediants that I will never be able to find where I am, but a quick substitution, and we're off. I've made the old fashioned cupcakes and the blueberry muffins and found them very easy to put together. And delicious. And I can bake these with my 3 yr old helping. Fun book that hopefully will get very dogeared and used.
0,Much, much better than the first book, which was still a good yarn.  Now we have humans in space, more aliens, political intrigue amongst the Minith, more indepth characterizations -- a real page turner.		I immediately downloaded Book 3.		Good show, Steven.
0,Scot Harvath is one cool, capable hero.  A ex-Navy SEAL, an ex-member of the U.S. Ski Team, and now a Secret Service agent who takes it upon himself to save the kidnapped U.S. President when everyone else is looking in the wrong direction.  The best thing is Harvath is not a superman-type hero.  He's got the same worries and fears that anyone would have in his situation.  Plus this guy just gets messed up throughout this book.  Buried under an avalanche, shot, beat up, thrown into a freezing river.  Still, Harvath's never quit attitude sees him through the situation.  Lots of great action scenes, especially in the beginning when a group of mercenaries carry out their brilliant plan to kidnap the President.  Good suspense and good flow to the story.  I'm looking forward to more Brad Thor books in the future.
0,Even if you've been writing action and conflict successfully for years, you're going to find something of value in this book, something that will raise your writing a notch. The author discusses different weapons, how they're used, how they can NOT be used, blunders to avoid in writing, raising suspense... Everything a writer needs to know for that perfect battle or skirmish or duel or act of self defense--any level of personal conflict. A must read!  (Free on Kindle at this time.)
0,The long awaited continuation of The Villain Daphne is back in London, in her own establishment, independent and free - or so she thinks!	But Adam isn't finished with his revenge against the Fairchild family, and soon a furious fight between revenge and desires rage between Daphne and Adam.		Adam has a very peculiar character development, which, of course, works in Daphnes favour in the end. Will revenge lead Adam or will his desire lead him to what he wants the most?		Will Daphne force the issue of what she truly wants or will she fall for Adams offer?		Sensual, and naughty but nothing we have not already seen Mistress Victoria do before, in her earlier books! I will HIGHLY recommend this continuing story of Adam and Daphne and see how the story between the Scottish Laird and His Dove ends.
0,Ben Rehder consistently turns out good stories. I have enjoyed every book he's written and can hardly wait to see what he comes up with next.
0,This book is everything!  I've heard nothing but great things about it and after reading it I can see why. Julie Murphy gives teens a realistic look into the life of a teenager that I think all teens need to read. Not everyone is the cheerleader and this book is a great example of how everyone is beautiful. I loved how confident Will was and I applaud the author for going against the norm with her characters. This is an amazing read that will help all of us find our inner Will!!
0,Once again debbie macomber hit it out of the ball park with another great read from the cedar cover series!
0,You can't corrupt someone if that person is already there. Yeah, Matt has some issues to deal with but as you will see life has not exactly been kind to him. Lucy on the other hand has a wicked sense of adventure that tends to get her in trouble. I'm cheering for these two kinky as all get up people. They belong together.		These two have grabbed the bull by the horn and followed where their biology has led them. I love Matt and Lucy's story along with all the supporting characters. Series like this that build upon characters in each book is highly appealing. It's like a faimly that the more you know and learn about them..,the more invested we are in the story and the outcome. Very..very enjoyable
0,When I was going through my divorce, my mom's therapist recommended that she read this and that she give it to me.  Both mom and I were baffled by the process I was going through (there were moments where she was screaming at me, "I just don't understand what you're thinking! I'm so confused!"--I thought, "Try being me!").  In the end, I read the book before she did.  I've only just finished it--I stayed up all night reading it and recognizing myself and my experience on so many of the pages--but already I am thankful for this book.  There's something reassuring about knowing that others go through very much the same thing.  Now I know that this "crazy time" I have been experiencing is part of a normal process.  What a relief!  The book has also helped me to start to process what went wrong in my marriage.  I am looking at the way I relate to people in new ways.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has encountered divorce or who plans to get married--as the quote on the cover says, this should really be required reading so people can avoid deadlock marriages.		No mumbo-jumbo or silly exercises to do--just straight talk about what happens to you when you go through a divorce.
0,This book is a light read, pleasant read even. It is mind opening, absolutely worth the read. Reading it with application on mind, asking yourself how it fits in your company, team, group or organization brings immediate changes to your way of thinking about building products and solving problems.		This being said, the formatting of the book is broken. A lot of spaces are missing, resulting in words being together, which often makes you lose your rhythm.		Still, a very nice read.		Addendum: It's interesting to note that the Kindle editions seems to be at fault for the missing spaces (as reported by the author, Robert I. Sutton, and hopefully will be corrected in future updates)
0,The life of a small town girl is not my thing. Ive waited twenty-six years to run from it. My chance at freedom comes when my Hollywood crush, Dax Pierce, comes to Mistport, Maine. When I started reading I couldn't put it down I read the book in one day. Dori is magnifysent writer. I cannot wait to read more of her books. Keep up the great work. You should definitely read this book.
0,"I dislike when converts are called `Jews by choice'. What are born Jews? Jews-by-force?" This question put by Charlene whose Marrano family settled in northern Mexico after fleeing from Spanish Inquisition points to one thing that many involuntary, "birth-forced" Jews could learn from this book: "Be sensitive to the intrinsic value of Judaism," Charlene says. "That's my message."	While Charlene, who converted to Judaism as a teenager and long before she discovered her Jewish roots, belongs to the chapter "Crypto-Jews", Barbara Kessel in the subsequent chapters reports equally intriguing statements of "Hidden Children", of "Children of Survivors" (of parents reluctant to disclose their Jewishness) and of "Adoptees".	In her Conclusions chapter, Barbara Kessel points out possible answers to the question she put in her introduction: "What do we learn about the concept of identity from those scores of people who said they were attracted to Judaism well before they discovered their Jewish ancestry?" She offers various approaches: Are those "Jews-again" motivated by the desire of "repairing the world and themselves" as many former hidden children who became psychologists do in their professional work? Are they escaping from some kind of what Leon Festinger calls "cognitive dissonance", in this case from the unease of having to live in a belief system which forces them to belie their basic feelings and concepts? Do their Jewish souls reside in Carl Jung's collective unconscious? Or are those returnees right who describe this inheritance as "something transmitted genetically" (Maria B. Gonzalez, p. 21), as "tissue memory" (Miriam Ramos, p. 25) or "genetic coding" (Margarita Hernandez, p. 27)? Are there certain "Jewish characteristics ... that have a genetic basis" (p. 122), similar to the fact that "kinship among mice ... is determined partly by smell, and smell is carried by the genes" (p. 123)? Well, I prefer less odorous and rodent, albeit strongly traditional Jewish characteristics like disobedience in face of inhuman doctrines which led me, for instance, to the discovery of my family's Jewish roots after nine Catholic generations. Anyhow, Barbara Kessel's final statement implies a need that is common to all humans and a point for everyone who considers reading this down-to-earth, well-written book of very human interest: "Nine times out of ten, finding out who you are is the most life-affirming adjustment you can make."
0,The digitizing of 'Walden' is sort of a dichotomy.  Not sure that Thoreau would have approved of the process or all the gee-gaws one requires to read a digital version of his book which was probably written with a quill by moonlight.  However, it's here now and I must say it is wonderful to be able to have a copy of this book in my pocket for dipping into at any time.  Yes, there are a few small glitches with these digital books but the process is really not totally simple.  And my gratitude in having this copy far outweighs any irritation with any paragraph shifts.  I would recommend that any people who fall into the 'entitled' bracket, those who live on their devices rather than their wits perhaps could take some time to read this book and learn some tips on living simply and finding happiness.  At the very worst, you will be better prepared to compete on 'Survivor' ...
0,This is a very good and clean love story,  interjected with other types of love stories .
0,Nice to have for reference and new ideas
0,This book is simple read. It has inspired many of my team members to get up and take action. Must read
0,This book is such a fun adventure! I found myself looking forward to coming home from work so I could read it.  The author did a wonderful job of bringing us right into the safari without ever leaving the couch.  And what an important message for everyone to know...maybe this book can be the real life ivory needle that helps save the elephants.
0,This is a book from the perspective of a free market proponent who advocates abolishing the Federal Reserve Bank, aka the Fed. There is little consideration of opposing views as this is a book defending a proposition.		The author, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, noted the Fed "creates money out of thin air	in its abilities to print money, change interest rates, and change reserve ratios on how much can be lent according to how many deposits are on hand. Barack Obama noted "it's important to understand that much of that wealth was illusory in the first place" when discussing the recent economic downturn.		Paul fears that the Federal debt is too high and interest rates too low. These are creating financial problems that will not easily be resolved. Paul believes they the debt has been mismanaged so badly that it would be better to dissolve the Fed. A central bank, which the Fed is, serves in the interests of favored economic and political interests at the expense of the middle class, Paul argues.		If the Fed no longer exists, the Federal government will lose its ability to fund as much spending as it now does. Paul sees this as a mean to reduce spending in both military and social programs.		Paul believes that abolishing the Fed will require banks to lend more cautiously as they would no longer have the Fed to support them when they develop financial problems.		Paul observes the adjusted monetary base, which is money that is circulated or deposited in the Fed, was $856 billion in April 2008 and $1,749 billion in April, 2009. This increase was not due to any matching increase in national wealth. It is almost all new printed debt.		This increase in debt may financially work so long as enough depositors do not withdraw their funds. If this happens, banks turn to other banks, and if that is enough, they turn to the Federal government. The recent government bailout has increased the factional reserve, meaning far greater loans may be held by banks than they have money on hand.		There had been support for creating the Federal Reserve Bank or something immediately after President Andrew Jackson closed the Second Bank of the U.S. in 1836 following a financial panic. A banking panic in 1907 was a leading cause for creating the Federal Reserve Bank a few years later.		Paul argues that bank failures and business failures are part of recurring business cycles. The Fed was supposed to minimize business cycles. Paul argues the Fed was acted in ways that mad the cycles worse.		Paul wants our government to own more gold. The U.S. and other Western banks are selling off gold because of their high debts. Paul argues the recent economic downturn is an economic correction to the overspending prior to the downturn.		Paul argues paper money is unconstitutional as the Constitution requires debt payments in gold or silver. The U.S. Supreme Court, though, consider paper money as "necessary and proper".		Paul favors letting the free market set interest rates.		Senator Bernie Sanders, a socialist, and Paul together have introduced legislation to audit the Fed. He notes the call for an audit cuts across the political spectrum. In fact, Paul argues the actions of the Fed that cause the flow of wealth from the poor and middle class to the wealthy should concern many.
0,You know those greatest hits albums where an iconic band will tack on a couple extra songs, lukewarm new material or stuff that got cut from previous releases? That's kind of how The Legends Club is for John Feinstein, who has covered a lot of this ground before between A March to Madness and to lesser degrees with Forever's Team, Season on the Brink, and A Season Inside, to say nothing of his work with The Washington Post and elsewhere. Anyone who has read Feinstein's body of work will feel deja vu with The Legends Club. You get the impression the Duke grad wanted to write the definitive Mike Krzyzewski book but Coach K would cooperate only if it didn't focus entirely on him. The widows of Dean Smith and Jim Valvano, along with younger brother Bob Valvano, provide a lot of great anecdotes, but Krzyzewski's wife, Mickie, gets a lot more ink.		I didn't get through this knowing anything more about Valvano that wasn't in ESPN's terrific 30-for-30 "Survive and Advance" special other than a little more through the eyes of Krzyzewski. Ditto for Dean Smith. You'd think between the fact that Valvano and Smith no longer are with us and the fact that Smith never granted Feinstein the unlimited access he's come to expect, Feinstein might have spent at least as much time for this book - if not more - with former NC State and UNC players as he did with Duke players. Heck, Smith's touching gesture of arranging for each of his former players to receive $200 after his death for a nice dinner isn't even mentioned. But we sure as heck know that the 1990s ACC tournament game pitting the 8-9 seeds was the Les Robinson game. That warranted a dozen references.		Anyone who has read a Feinstein book has grown accustomed to a dozen pages of name dropping in the acknowledgements and Legends Club is no different. But the photo inset, dominated by photos of Feinstein with the three subjects, is downright awkward.		Still, if you grew up an ACC basketball fan -- I went to Lefty Driesell's Maryland basketball camp and graduated from Virginia -- you'll appreciate Feinstein's aggregation of his previous work. It's just that the prolific hoops writer needs some new subject matter. Here's hoping his agent Esther Newberg declares a moratorium on ACC hoops books.
0,I got this for my nephew and he loved it. great price and it kept him busy
0,This was very interesting and enjoyable ferry tale type story. Always amazes me how different authors create Time Travel books.
0,There is quite a bit of useful information in this book and it is GREAT for a reference guide. It is an easy read. The information in it needs updated as it pertains to what to use as mulch/compost and little things like that based on what we now know about chemical additives in our paper products but is otherwise AWESOME.
0,John Scalzi is quickly shaping up to be the next Big Name in modern SF. This book synthesizes the best elements of several of the best other SF writers -- it has plotting and action reminiscent of Heinlein, situational comedy that rivals Douglas Adams while still (somehow) retaining believability, something of Neal Stephenson's eye for future trendspotting and commentary, and even a taste here and there of Vernor Vinge.		This book is definitely for adults, or at least for readers old enough to handle topics like bestiality or the desire of an AI for sex without flinching. The best way to describe the book might be by stating the opening: A human diplomat creates an interstellar diplomatic incident when he uses a rectally-implanted gadget to fart out insulting messages in the scent-language of an alien race. Not that the book is overly crude -- it is, in fact, a testament to Scalzi's writing that all of the crudity is perfectly incoporated into and dictated by the needs of the plot -- but still, be aware. (If this paragraph has made you more interested in the book, good!)		It will be very interesting to track Scalzi's growth as a writer. As good as this book is, there are parts of it that are slightly derivative. But then, as (either T.S. Eliot or Mark Twain, I can't remember) said, "Mediocre writers borrow, great writers steal." There's nothing at all wrong with a book this well-crafted, and with this much of the writer's personal style in evidence, lifting a little here and there from other the other greats of the genre. After all, as the title's allusion indicates, that's part of the fun. And very few SF titles within recent memory are anywhere near as much fun as this.
0,Always love Gresham's novels. This one hints at a sequel that I would definitely love to continue to follow. Glad I got it
0,A daughter that is "hands off" and a man who doesn't take no for an answer leads the reader on a wonderful adventure through a logging camp and into a baking challenge. From the moment Tom Jeffries laid eyes on the beautiful Jo Christy, he was smitten and would do anything, even stand up to her taller than oak brothers, to win her hand. You'll enjoy this wonderful, touching Christmas novella of sweet romance.
0,I happened across this at my local library and, being a child of the sixties, found it a compelling subject. I breezed right through it and have little more to offer to the praise already put forth, other than this: I think of it often and have come to the conclusion that it needs to be a movie. The script would have everything! Humor, action, suspense, drama, pathos AND bathos, father/son dynamic, a solid moral context and life lesson. For a broad audience and stronger box-office, it could conceivably be PG-13, but R would probably be more of an accurate portrayal. Nice bookend to the movie "Blow", too.
0,Very cute, love how humanity is capable of having paranormal variants in our gene pool.  Loved the cute plot and characters!
0,As reviewed
0,I picked this book after a fellow author (RJ Keller) flagged it in her FB stream. I Kindled a sample, liked it a lot, and bought the whole thing pretty much immediately. I've enjoyed it ever since. Not every essay hits it out of the park, but there are some that are snorters. This guy is seriously funny, and best of all, he has substance. Some of his observations apply stock motifs in surprisingly effective ways. He writes very well. He laces in some fun 1980s cultural references, and has a nice middle-of-the-road stance toward some polarizing topics. All in all, a great find. The Force is strong in this one.
0,I've been a fan of Jill's for a very long time. She delivers interestingly quirky characters, plausible storylines, laced with steamy romance. Though this one continues with a cast of characters introduced in another book, this story is a stand alone read that you don't have to have read: that said, you should read it because she hasn't disappointed me yet. I've always wanted to visit San Francisco and hearing the architecture and districts described I want to even more! And the fountain...totally on the bucket list to see that fountain.  Another solid hit that won't leave you heartbroken.
0,I really liked this book! The characters felt real & the story good. The sex was hot but not over the top, just right. When you find yourself routing for the couple to find a way to make it even though you know they will, it means it's a good book.
0,I loved it.
0,My daughter cried the last 7 chapters. She loved it so much I could not get her to go to bed.
0,This is a great read and enjoyed it very much and I recommend it for those wanting to understand Complete Armor	Of God and wanting to know how or do Spiritual Warfare. Thank you!
0,This book was harder than the mcat at times.  It is a good resource if you want to improve using questions that are more challenging.
0,Darrel Bain is at it again.  This time we have the pleasure of learning all about the comedic antics of Biscuit, his pet dachshund.  Or as Bain describes him, "six inches high, six feet long, has ears that drag the ground and likes to lick faces."		I'm sure the description is pretty close, because fans of Darrell Bain know full well he isn't given to hyperbole. And if you believe that, you'll probably believe that this man who truly resides at Santa Claus Lane hates ice cream.		Bain weaves tale after tail of the trials and adventures of raising a puppy on a tree farm in the wilds of Texas.  He seemingly writes with a wink and a perpetual gleam in this eye, which is why the stories are fun to read.  I wonder if Bain develops a Pinocchio nose whenever he starts putting his ideas down on paper.		But why shouldn't the reader believe Biscuit created his own vocabulary, can honk a truck horn, or had a wild run-in with Viagra?  Fact or fiction?  I'll leave that for you to decide.		The reader will come to love and laugh at a little dog he or she will never meet.  In the process however, Bain reminds us that life isn't all rosy, and can bite you when you least expect it.  The harsh realities of life play a minor role in this entertaining little book, and leave an impression that lasts a tad longer than the light-hearted theme.  But whoever said life would be all ice cream and doggie biscuits?
0,I really enjoyed reading all these books, which is why I read the entire series.	Great writing, held my attention, highly recommend for fun.
0,I have bought or read every childcare book on the market. This one is the best by far.  It is comprehensive, easy to follow, and relatively cheap.  I have consulted it many times when my kids were sick and it helped out my mind to ease.  I have bought several to give as presents to new parents.
0,Very captivating!
0,Wow this book was simply amazing. I found out her secret and Ethan fell more in love with her. They had some ups and down's. I am thinking something and will find out soon in book 3. I loved how they became so in love and are so deep with it. They care for eachother and are a great couple to follow. They've had hard times but are overcoming them. I LOVE them!!!
0,I absolutely love everything I've read by this author. She makes all her characters come alive and make you care about what happens to them.
0,This is a poignant story rich in history, detail, hardships, overcoming circumstances, and knowing who to trust (besides the Lord, and including the Lord). It's early in the year, so for me to say this is the best book of the year does not do it enough justice. But it is. Which is too bad for all the other books I am going to read this year, because this is going to be tough to beat.		First, I need to touch on the details. Jocelyn Green is a wealth of knowledge, and luckily for us shares so much of this knowledge with us in this book. The attention to detail she puts in every sentence is outstanding. You can see and feel your surroundings in historic France. You can hear the war in the background in historic Pennsylvania. You can place yourself amongst historic figures like Alexander Hamilton; you can experience what life was like as a lacemaker in a time and place where that was not acceptable; and you can see what it means to leave everything you know and go out into a new world. You should also prepare yourself to learn something new, because you will. Even fiction novels can provide information to what happened in the past. Yes, some of it is dramatized, but it was evident how much time and research that Jocelyn Green put into this book to bring the time period and characters to life.		And bring them to life she did. Vivienne and Liam are wonderfully charming, stubborn, fearless, and brave. You can't help but cheer them on, both separately and together. I would have loved to bake with Vivienne and hear stories about France, or join Liam in meetings to see his passion for doing what is right. You learn so much about them over the course of the book that you feel like their friend. Their family. In fact, I was so sad to see the book end, because I didn't want their story to end. But, the great thing is that I still have them with me in this book. I can open the pages and revisit them whenever I want. And trust me, I will!		I received a complimentary copy of this book. I was not required to write a favorable review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.
0,At first the title caught my attention. I couldn't determine what the storyline would be... from the very beginning, the plot twists will draw you in.  The characters also are quite compelling.  You will enjoy!
0,Jennifer Hotes' Four Rubbings is an exquisitely wrought YA novel full of beauty, intrigue, and adventure that is crafted with love and care.		Throughout the work, her prose is lush and lovely. Her words and the descriptions created from them shine like polished stones, like those that devoted survivors place on top of the headstones of their dearly departed. Also quite beautiful are the characters of the four teen stars of the novel. They are all resourceful, grounded, compassionate, and loving, despite their less than perfect home lives.		While adventurous, these young people are rarely reckless. As a former teacher of YA Lit to children exactly their age, this is an important distinction. At times they often behave better and more responsibly than the adults in this book. But these teen characters don't come off as too perfect. They show disappointment, frustration, impatience, and even romantic feelings for each other. At fourteen years old, its only natural these four friends since childhood might develop little crushes on their friends as they mature, and they do.		This is important because the population that this book is written for wants characters they can relate to a lot more than characters their parents want them to read about.		Overall, Four Rubbings is an absorbing and fulfilling read. As plotted, it begs for a sequel.
0,Caged in Winter is an awesome read! The storyline, the characters, everything just sucked me in and wouldn't let go until I devoured each and every word. This book is almost perfect. While I really enjoyed Winter, I just had a bit of a hard time relating to her. Not because she wasn't realistic, she was. I just couldn't relate 100%.		Winter is a former foster child who is trying to out run her past and make a future for herself. She is currently waitressing through school, when she meets Cade. Well, not really "meet". He noticed her right away, her fake smile and flirty attitude, but sad, dull eyes. He stepped in when a customer got handsy with her. Then, she blew up in his face for costing her a much needed tip from Mr. Hands. The story just rolls on from there. He wants to know what's behind those eyes, to crack into her heart. She doesn't want a Prince Charming and feels like she needs to keep him at an arm's length.		These two characters have so much growth throughout the story. While Winter is learning that it's okay to let people in and to depend on people, Cade is learning how to give up the weight of responsibility he feels. They learn and grow together. I absolutely loved how they supported each other's dreams and encouraged the other to reach for them. The author found a perfect balance for these characters.		I absolutely loved their dynamic. Cade is the right mix of alpha, patience, and support; the perfect match for Winter. I enjoyed reading about Winter learning to open her heart to Cade. She was alone and only had herself to depend on for so long, that it was a really slow process. This is my favorite aspect of the story. They got to know each other. Their attraction and chemistry was off the charts, but they took it slowly. I'm just so glad that it wasn't insta-love. It made the whole story all the more real.
0,This book was a wild ride from start to finish. I read it in one evening, and when I finished, I felt like I'd just ripped through an entire series in one day instead of a novella. It was AMAZING. Everything was unexpected and not at all what it seemed, and the blend between Norse mythology and the core retelling of Beauty and the Beast was unlike anything I've ever read. Hands down one of my favorite books to date.
0,I was so delighted to receive this gorgeous book as a Christmas present. The exquisite colors, fine quality and highly detailed photographs of James C. Christensen's paintings are a joy to behold. The included notes for many of the paintings increased my appreciation and enjoyment. I have been an admirer of his delightful works for many years. These works, whether a fantasy character, poofy man or more realistic style will leave one feeling inspired & uplifted. This is a fabulous book I will return to again & again.
0,This was a really good book, I love the protagonist!  Moves very quickly and a great revenge story.  A very interesting premise too, of a woman who "hides" people, like a one woman witness protection agency.
0,Overall, a really good read! Lots of action and excitement to make a person want to keep reading, and the ending doesn't disappoint and makes you look forward to the next book.
0,Slow starting, good story.

0,If reading about cleaning and getting rid of pests is your idea of a fascinating read this book is for you. I found it very useful even though I have been making my own cleaners for years. I found some new and interesting recipes that I am planning to use soon. It tends to be a bit repetitive about the harmfulness of chemicals etc. but the recipes are easily found in framed tables while browsing the book, so you can easily skip those parts when you are in a hurry.
0,Good read
0,When I saw the comparisons to Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen I just had to give "Gutshot Straight" a try. And believe it or not, Lou Berney's debut novel lives up to the comparison.		"Gutshot Straight" is a fun crime caper novel involving a newly freed ex-con named Shake matching wits with an Armenian crime boss, some hired hitmen, a Vegas hood and a shifty stripper. The pace doesn't let up from the opening page, and Shake immediately becomes someone you want to follow. And follow him you do, from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to Panama, all while evading bad guys and trying to cash in on a 5 million dollar prize. The story takes a few twists, there is a double-cross thrown in here and there, and plenty of oddball characters introduced that add a wonderful flavor to the tale. I won't spoil the tale by dropping any hints as to what everyone is chasing, who is allied with who and why. But if you like fast paced, quirky crime novels, you should check this out.		I'm hoping Berney is planning a series based on the Shake character as he is too much fun to lose after a single story.

0,Another incredible story and a beautiful HEA to one of my favourite couple . You brought it home Pepper! Thank you.
0,Great Book and great pics, I am not a collector. Book is great for anyone who had these in the 1980's. Hope they come out with another book with the later series. Very Pleased with this purchase!
0,One of the best books I've ever read...absolutely brilliant.
0,I loved the idea of the people with special mind abilities, and the first person narration really made the discovery of Darren's abilities fun and suspenseful. I zipped through all three books because I couldn't wait to see what happened next.
0,I received this book from the author, in exchange for an honest review.		Ashley Capes is a very eclectic writer: I became aware of his writing through the first book of his fantasy saga, "City of Masks" and its sequel "The Lost Mask" that should reach the shelves soon. Then I was asked to read and review his novella "The Fairy Wren", a curious and inspired combination of mainstream and fantastic elements. I also know he writes poetry, even though my abysmal ignorance of the medium prevents me from appreciating what Im certain are equally enjoyable works.		So, when Mr. Capes proposed I read his newest novella, "A Whisper of Leaves", I accepted immediately, since I was curious to see what new avenues he would lead me along. This is again a different kind of story, both in concept and background, since its based in Japan: even though modern civilization tends to create a similar context, no matter where you are in the world, there are subtle differences in outlook and mind-view and they tend to influence both the characterization and the story itself. I found these almost subliminal differences quite intriguing, and they added to the appeal of the novella.		In short, the main character Riko has come to live and work in Japan, though she was born and grew up in Australia where her parents moved long ago. As the story opens, shes facing some work troubles brought on by a huge misunderstanding and to take her mind off these troubles shes hiking at the foot of Mount Fuji with her friend and roommate Kiyomi. When Riko finds an old journal hidden by the forests underbrush, she doesnt know that the apparently innocuous object will have a deep impact on her life and on the way she views the world.		This is as far as Im prepared to discuss the story, because I believe readers must discover it on their own: what I feel free to reveal about it is that its a tale about obsession, and how it can impact our lives, even beyond our will.  Obsession can take many forms: like the kind that possesses Riko, ready to put aside her own problems, and to jeopardize her friendship with Kiyomi, to uncover the mystery held by the pages of the journal, and to know as much as possible about Makiko  the journals owner  and her life. As the story progresses, we see how obsession can live even beyond the grave, how it can fuel a souls search for fulfillment and how it can motivate any creature to deeds of love or hate, which for some might be divided by a very thin border...		In consideration of the novellas compelling quality, I can easily say that burning curiosity was indeed the driving force that moved me to finish it quickly: the clues pile up in such a crescendo that you will not be able to close the book until you have solved the mystery at the basis of the story. And thats not such a bad way to give in to obsession after all!
0,This book popped up recommendations from Amazon yesterday.  I was having yet another day of struggle.  Although a couple of weeks ago I picked up one of the many free booklets from Unity entitled Prayer, and towards the end there was a short chapter on the power of amen.  It
0,Loved it!! Very enjoyable!!
0,What a unique style.  I couldn't put this book down and this is not my  preferred  genre.  A must read!
0,Is a small book but has great, great recipes, if you are in a hurry and need a sauce to make your diner spectacular you need this book.	A good sauce makes a big difference in any plate.	The recipes are well written and are very easy to follow.	I absolutely adore this book.
0,Ever since first learning about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in school, I've been fascinated with their story so when I got the chance to read this book, I couldn't wait. For those of you unfamiliar with the Rosenbergs, they were a Jewish couple living in New York City during the Red scare of the 1950's. They were accused of spying for the Russians and giving them the instructions for building an atomic bomb. This book is a fictionalized account of these occurrences as seen through the eyes of a neighbor.	The book's main character is Millie. She is a wife and mother living in the same building as the Rosenbergs. She becomes friends with Ethel and they bond over both having difficult sons. Millie's son David doesn't speak and is prone to tantrums and her husband Ed, a Russian emigre, wants to send David to live in a home so he doesn't have to deal with him anymore. Millie refuses to let Ed take her son from her but she must make some sacrifices in order to keep him. Ed is a thoroughly unlikable character and I found his situation at the end of the book quite satisfying.	Millie meets a man named Jake at a party at the Rosenbergs' and when he tells her he is a psychotherapist and that he may be able to help David to communicate, Millie eventually warms to the idea and she and David spend many afternoons with Jake as he works with David. Millie begins to eagerly anticipate these afternoons with Jake and soon realizes that she's in love with him. Jake says he feels the same way but there are things about Jake that Millie doesn't know and these secrets could change her life forever.	I appreciated this book's take on the Rosenbergs. I've always felt that they were wrongfully accused and I like that this book painted them in such a sympathetic light. I was unable to put this book down once I started reading it.
0,An amazing read! I read the book halfway in 2013 when it first came out. I had to travel out of country for some time so I had to abandon it. I picked it up again last week and read it from start to finish. I had enjoyed Ms. Pessl's first book, "Special Topics in Calamity Physics" immensely and Enjoyed "Night Film" equally if not more. The story is about a "horror" movie director Stanislaw Cardova and his daughter Ashley but neither actually ever makes an appearance. We know about them through a reporter who suspects Cardova is actually involved in black magic, torture and may be even murder. His charismatic daughter Ashley dies under mysterious circumstances. Reality interacts with fantasy; life with movies and fact with fiction. Things are often not what they appear to be. Cardova's message is that to experience life fully you have to experience fear as fully as love. You have to have courage to confront fear with eyes wide open and 'fight your way out of it and fly.'

0,I think the book of Josephus is a must for anyone that wants to fully understand the Bible. To understand the history of the Bible is the key to fuuly understanding the scripture.
0,This was definitely a well balanced contemporary romance: straightforward hot sexual desire, danger, suspense, and laughter. What a sexy wrap up to her Winston Brothers Series. I enjoyed that each brother had their own unique expression of their sexuality: Cole (steadfast patient lover) - Tangled Sheets; Chase (bewildering "kinky" lover) - Tangled Dreams; Mack (playful accepting lover) - Tangled Images; and finally, Zane (feral protective lover) - Wild.		LF doesn't miss the mark in her grand final-lee of her Winston Brothers series, Wild. Zane is the seductive alpha male. At first, for six years, Tamara was just the business woman (mysterious gypsy) next door, however the more he was determined to know her after that one afternoon she walked into his store and declared to him "I want you...to share your body with me, and let me give you mine", the more he desired to fulfill his secreted fantasies of "scorching carnal activities" with her.  The initial stun and embarrassment of her straightforwardness caused him to reject her, conversely after considering the many days and nights he previously spent obsessing over this mysterious gypsy, he decided to accept her proposition for an evening of mutual physical attraction.		The more time he spent with her, the more his attraction grew into a deep emotional attachment, protectiveness and affection for her. However, there's a problem. Someone is trying to run her out of town, even to the point of possibly murdering her.		It's wonderful to see the Winston brothers and family take a united front to protect the love interest of Zane.		Her eccentric family involvement resonates at a deep level because you can identify with it if you come from such a family - i.e. `My Big Fat Greek Wedding'. We've all been there in one way or another... at one time or another... and many of us have been there more times than we'd care to admit. Her gypsy Uncle Thanos, Aunt Eva and Aunt Olga embarrass her with their old world beliefs - believing the damaging schemes against Tamara and her shop are due to they're being haunted by a deceased Uncle Hubert.		Again this is a multi-faceted character romance story - not as much committed to the "romance" of falling in love, but the old saying of `you not only marry your spouse but their whole family...'
0,I bought this book in a kindle format initially. I'm so glad it's available as a paperback! Excellent reference for nurses on required documentation for ICD-10 in a fast-find format. It covers the things your documentation must have for claims to be billed correctly and paid timely.
0,Loved this book! I liked the family dynamics: stepmom and ghosts. The story was fun to read and had lots of great twists that kept the story moving!
0,If you're chicken enough to stop eating at fast-food restaurants, then you should probably quit buying food at your local super-market all together and grow your own food!	Most of the food we consume has chemical color, scents, and flavor enhancers...including simple things such as hot dog buns.  Guess what, the pink that makes your strawberry ice-cream look its color, is made out of insects.	Pick up this book!  It is intriguing.
0,From Internet sources we discover impressive biographical information about brilliant novelist Tosca Lee, a bestselling American author of historical novels and supernatural thrillers. She is best known for her exploration of maligned characters, prodigious research and vivid imagery. Lee was born in Roanoke, Virginia, United States to a Korean father and Caucasian American mother. Her father, Professor Emeritus Sang Moon Lee, who had early aspirations of an opera career, named Tosca for his favorite Puccini opera. As a young classically trained ballerina and pianist Lee pursued an early career in dance until injuries derailed hopes of a successful career. Lee received her BA in English from Smith College and studied international economics at Oxford University. As a young classically trained ballerina and pianist Lee pursued an early career in dance until injuries derailed hopes of a successful career.		Lee continues her study of historically significant, maligned, and tortured characters in her thriller, FIRSTBORN, a supernatural suspense thriller centered around the fictional descendants of the "Blood Countess" Elizabeth Bthory. In this volume Lee offers more information about the legend: Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bthory de Ecsed (15601614) is the most notorious female serial killer of all time. The exact number of her victims is unknown, though one witness testified at trial to a total of 650, as detailed in the countesss private diary. Her accomplices were burned at the stake, but Bthory herself was spared execution. Instead, she was walled up in a set of rooms in Cachtice Castle (in present-day Slovakia), where she remained for four years until her death in 1614. Known to be exceptionally educated, wealthier than the crown, and a doting mother to her children, the private life and sins of Elizabeth Bthory remain a mystery. History calls her a monster. Others, a victim of conspiracy and greed. Legend knows her as the Blood Countess.		Lees magical way with ideas and words is evident in the intense opening to this mesmerizing novel: Six weeks ago, I woke up in a cabin in the north woods of Maine with no memory of the last two years or any pertinent details of my life before. My real identity, for one, along with the names and faces of anyone I ever lovedall erased by an elective procedure I chose to undergo in a bid to protect a powerful secret. Because when you're me, knowledge is dangerous. And my memory is deadly. It took them one month to find me. My name is Audra Ellison and I am twenty-one years old. Ive spent the last two weeks on the run, chased across Eastern Europe, hiding in her underground. Piecing together the past I erased. Not knowing whom to trust. I am a direct descendant of the Blood Countess Elizabeth Bathory, the most prolific female serial killer of all time, and I am being hunted by an ancient organization called the Scions of the Dispossessed, who have sworn to destroy her progeny. For four hundred years they have systematically murdered our kind in revenge for Bathorys purported atrocities against their peasant ancestors. They are peasants no more; today their secret society backs some of the most powerful offices in Europe, with influence throughout the world. But the Progenyalso called the Utodare not without resources. We are gifted with a legacy passed through the female line. We can persuade others without words. We can appear to possess the characteristics that anyone looking at us wants to see. We have  unnaturally strong charisma. We stand out in a crowd. Which is great if you want to be a rock star . . . But terrible when you're trying to hide.		Lees synopsis prepares the reader well: Face-to-face with her past, Audra Ellison now knows the secret she gave up everythingincluding her memoryto protect. A secret made vulnerable by her rediscovery, and so powerful neither the Historian nor the traitor Prince Nikola will ever let her live to keep it. With Luka in the Historians custody and the clock ticking down on his life, Audra only has one impossible chance: find and kill the Historian and end the centuries old war between the Progeny and Scions at lastall while running from the law and struggling to control her growing powers. With the help of a heretic monk and her Progeny friends Claudia, Piotrek, and Jester, Audra will risk all she holds dear in a final bid to save them all and put her powers to the ultimate test. Love, action, and stunning revelation reign in this thrilling conclusion to The Progeny.		Concluding one of the most well executed novels of recent years Tosca Lee delivers this second segment of her series THE HOUSE OF BATHORY with polished prose and a very keen sense of timing and drama that brings the legend of Countess Elizabeth Bthory de Ecsed to life. But Lee makes the story even more fascinating by blending the concept of Elizabeths descendents and their gradual demise through near sci-fi means. With Lee the story seems all actual and terrifyingly real. Step aside Bram Stoker et al  Lee Tosca reigns! . Grady Harp, April 18		I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book.
0,Hoffman is one of my favorite authors.  This continues the story that began in Redemption, which got me hooked.  I hope she has another one in the works.
0,I couldn't put the book, well my Kindle, down. The book really kept my attention and i get bored easy but i love to read. I really recommend it.
0,Kudos to Lia Habel for creating a richly three-dimensional world that only in a few points strained my ability to suspend disbelief. It's not an entirely easy sell: a post-apocalyptic world in which the dominant members of society have fully embraced Victoriana while the rebel "punks" are evolving their own cultural strain, adopting some of the trappings of the mainstream society retrofitted with steampower. To this, you add zombies...some of which retain the power of reason.		Habel manages to pull it off, I think, by mixing intelligent and plausible characterization with just enough myth-building to keep things moving. She doesn't put too much time into explication, but wisely lets her characters take many of the trappings of their world for granted. (Sensible; when's the last time you stopped to ponder the workings of your refrigerator or telephone?) This lets us take them for granted, too.		Those who want to immerse themselves in a steampunk world may not find this truly to their liking. Although there is adventure here (and plenty of it), where this book excels is in characterization. The book is written from the shifting perspectives of the main characters, with the bulk of the story being narrated by Nora (our heroine and romantic lead), Bram (the "thinking dead" hero) and Pamela (a strong supporting female friend). Fully developed back stories and sympathetic motivations make their adventures compelling. In my opinion, all of them: while some readers may find Pamela's subplot distracting, I found myself just as interested in her fate as I was the main duo's. That's high praise, since the main duo had more going for them than the inherent tension of a Romeo-Juliet romance, with Nora trying to make sense of her new reality and preparing for a reunion with her father and Bram a soldier attempting to deal with heightened threat levels from the mindless dead.		Reading the text on the back of this book, my son compared it to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Twilight/dp/0316031844/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Twilight</a>, but while I enjoyed that series, I found this a better book. There was simply so much more going on, and all of it was entertaining. That said, this is by comparison "romance lite"--the romantic angst in this novel is much more low key. If the tortured yearning appeals to you - well, you will find some of that here. But it's more internal, and balanced by major focus on other things.		This book is the first in a series, but those who (like me) worry about committing to new series need not fear. Habel kindly provides good closure here. There's certainly enough left open for her upcoming sequel, but in terms of this story, I'm satisfied.
0,Cute story! It was frustrating how long it took them to acknowledge their feelings, but sadly that is how some people are in the real world.
0,Wonderfully written with characters that stay with you long after you finish reading. I was totally hooked and loved every minute.
0,Alex Kimmell brought back to me visions of the Twilight Zone!  His collection of eclectic stories kept me coming back for more.  Though he's a horror writer in general, these stories take your brain on a new adventure.  The writing is solid and crisp, and his scene descriptions allow you to visualize the story like a movie.  I can't wait for Alex's next collection of stories!

0,This book may be a very useful tool for people who are ready to break the cycle of self-destruction and family dysfunction. Living with alcoholism absolutely affects everyone in the house, and we don't have to live with the secrets anymore. If you don't want to pass the hurt, the shame, the pain on to your own children, get this book and begin to heal the wounds of your own childhood.
0,Book gives you insight into the behind the scenes action in court.  Easy reading!
0,I wait with bated breath for the her books each year.  I have read them all numerous times.  The latest doesn't disappoint.  Nora never fails to give a great read and her character development is only exceeded by her great dialog. With this latest book her heroin Lila and her hero Ashton have a great mystery to solve and adding one of the scariest villains I've ever read added to the enjoyment.  Nora writes great strong female characters and adds witty dialog in all her books.	When I read a Nora Roberts or a J D Robb book I start over to reread as soon as I'm done.  I do that with no other author.
0,This book had a lot of great stuff in it. The magic system of Osteomancy, is a fresh idea that I was immediately intrigued by. The story setting, a re-imagining of California in the Sixties after a powerful 'mancer causes it to secede from the Union,  allowed me to the relate it to the California I've known, while also allowing for creative license. The Heist is used as a literary device and serves to anchor the story when it begins to wander off on to tangents.		The issue was that it was all of those things, but not Enough of them. We get a few lines and explanations of how osteomancy works and that Daniel is different, but after that it's mainly listing off the ingredients in people. I wanted to see more Osteomantic baddassery.		The world building was very well integrated into the story, almost to the point of being immaterial. Yes there are canals rather than boulevards, but WHY? What does that DO for us? A few lines near the end up the book don't sate my curiosity. The North/South split, the secession, and so many more things mentioned in passing... I want more of those. I want to know things.		And finally the heist plot was almost rudimentary, sketch like. It wasn't the piece de resistance like it was in Ocean's Eleven, or the Heist, or Fast Five, or any other number of heist stories. It was just some scenes, and didn't seem like it was meaty enough.		This book had so many great parts in it, but it never seemed to gel together. I dithered between 4 and 5 stars, but in the end, while I definitely want to read more from Greg, and am hoping for more in the same world, it didn't have that Something to push it into five star territory. I'd recommend this novel to teens and up with an interest in fantasy and/or heist novels.
0,While I am an avid history buff, I will admit that my knowledge of the Vietnam War is a bit sketchy. Until I picked up this book, I had no idea that we even flew propeller aircraft in the war, or the potential that each pilot rescue had to become a major air and ground engagement. George Marrett did a nice job of adding to my knowledge.		=== The Good Stuff ===		* First and foremost, the book has some absolutely spell-binding content. It is simply amazing to me that a single person could handle as many simultaneous tasks as the combat rescue pilots were able to manage, and Marrett does a nice job of explaining the complexity and details of what these men accomplished.		* Marrett is pretty honest with his readers. He discusses fear, doubt, anxiety, and his emotions, both during the actual combat rescues and later sitting in the "officers club". Probably the best chapter of the book is written after he leaves Vietnam, and begins to wonder just what the whole purpose of all the sacrifices was. Looking back, I am not sure we ever answered that question.		* There was a nice mix of the technical and human sides of his experiences. i am not a pilot, have never been in the military, and have never been shot at---but I finished the book with a decent appreciation of what it took to fly (and learn to fly) a rescue mission.		* While the book bogged down in a couple spots, and can get somewhat repetitive, I ended up reading the book in two or three sittings, and it held my interest throughout.		=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===		*Marrett writes in the understated style, commonly found in people that routinely risk their lives in dangerous jobs. While i am not a fan of overly dramatic and semi-hysterical prose, the author takes it a bit too far. The danger, risks and absolute terror that these pilots felt can easily get lost in the stoic, understated prose. It takes a bit of an effort to stop reading for a minute and think about what you actually read.		Someone actually was flying a prop-driven plane, low and slow, over state-of-the-air anti-aircraft weapons, combining the roles of combat pilot, navigator, search and rescue officer, and forward air controller while bullets were literally whizzing by. And the consequences of a mistake? Death, a horrible captivity, or at the very least a nasty couple days in the jungle.		* Other than the final chapter of the book, where Marrett admits his doubts about the purpose of the whole war, the author never really gets above the level of tactics of an individual rescue. He avoids any mention of the strategy of the war, the geopolitical goals of the US, or any short and long-term consequences of Vietnam. It would have been interesting to see his take on these subjects.		Marrett studiously avoids any contemplation of the cost/benefit of the efforts spent rescuing pilots, or their remains. He takes it on faith that "we don't leave Americans behind", and acts accordingly. But I did get the feeling that he may have had some doubts about risking and losing live soldiers to rescue deceased ones. Given the risks he took and friends he lost, It would have been interesting to hear his thoughts on the subject.		=== Summary ===		I enjoyed the book, and walked away with an appreciation for what these pilots went through. There were some parts that I felt could have been better, or at least expanded upon, but I would recommend the book to anyone with an interest in Vietnam and especially the actions of rescue teams.

0,Phew, I feel like I have just stepped off a roller coaster after reading Silent Lies. What a web we weave indeed.		What should be a normal happy family is destroyed by deception. Mia is thrown into turmoil when hubby Zach commits suicide, she goes through the daily motions simply to keep daughter Freya going. Zach dies the same night one of his students goes missing .. does he have anything to do with Josies disappearance.		Life moves on, Mia finds a new love interest, Will. Then out of the blue Josies room-mate Alison appears and tells them Zach didn't kill himself!		Mia is left shattered but determined to investigate further. The twists and turns that follow will make you giddy. And the outcome is totally unexpected.		I thoroughly enjoyed Silent Lies .. well written, edge of your seat stuff, never quite sure who to believe or who if anyone to offer sympathy too.		A tremendous psychological thriller and I will be checking out other books by Kathryn. Thanks to the author, publisher and netgalley for my copy which I read and reviewed voluntarily.
0,Building on the fast paced action of Terms of Enlistment, Lines of Departure slows just a little to add some character development. Nicely done!
0,This book gripped me from the first sentence.  I was hooked even when I didn't want to be!  I have never heard of this author and was a little unsure if I would even like this book.  I figured that I would give it a chance, but had set my mind to think I would end up not liking it.  I was so wrong.		My heart broke from the first pages and those pages were intense.  The rest of the book grew in intensity and at times I thought I wouldn't be able to take any more!  Many times I would try to set a time limit to reading it so that it wouldn't consume my thoughts, but too often I turned the timer off and sat back down to read "just one more chapter."		I personally liked the first person storytelling.  It's something different that I hadn't read in quite a long time.  It made me feel as though I was, in fact, one of the characters and I think that's partly what made it more intense.  Of course, I wanted answers and I didn't want to be hurting by my wife's actions!		This book is the first book in the Jevin Banks Experience Series.  I'm very much looking forward to the second book in this series and to see how the story all plays out.		______________		I received this book free from Revell Publishers in exchange for my honest opinion of this book.
0,As recommended by a friend, I read the book quickly then set aside my "one day" to focus more on each chapter and build my own personal life plan. I dove into the book and plan today. 6.5 hours, lots of notes, 2 Sparks and 10 pages later, I have the start of a Life Plan that can keep me from drifting away from what's most important. It was a helpful and personal process; flexible to meet people at different seasons of life, but a great template to work through your dreams and plans. Certainly the dedicated day (with a few breaks) was necessary. I love the themes that surfaced in most of my relationships and priorities which just confirms how interrelated it all is. Giving it a full day to work on (your Life Plan) will help ideas flow from thought to thought in a productive way. I had spa music in the background so  could focus but have some mental stimulation through the day. There are also helpful ideas to put the plan to work and review it from time to time to revise as needed. Life has plot twists so that will be necessary, but the overall life goals should stay the about the same. If you are seeking a process or template to help plan your next few years or more, I recommend this book. Also would make a great gift. I wish I had this tool in my early 20s, but it's just as helpful in my early 40s.
0,This introduction to Carol Jordan and Tony Hill is an ode to excellent characterization.  There are no stock players straight from central casting here.  McDermid takes the time to crawl around in people's heads and make the story interesting from that angle.  This is something few authors do.		The mystery itself was top notch. It moved in unexpected ways and finished off with a bang.  Tension between Tony and Carol gives the book an extra spark, especially with Tony's personal demons.		I'll be back for more of this series.
0,Really love the Corey texts. Very readable and very informative.  The case of Stan is good and shows each theory of counseling.
0,Ok this is a book that should come with a couple of warnings, like do not read while drinking because sudden bursts of laughter could cause unseemly displays, do not read in public because rolling on the floor of public transport may cause you to be arrested, among others.	Seriously I kept highlighting lines that had me in fits of laughter and looking back I have pages of highlights from the first line in the first chapter "What are you thinking about hike you're pretending to listen to me?" I was hooked.	Lily as a heroine I wish I had as a best friend, I just loved her sense of humour, "chipmunks are adorable, I'm empowered." Now who could argue with that, and she comes across as so down to earth, loyal and sincere and real that I want to add her to my address book.	Now Adam on the other hand I wouldn't mind adding to my little black book, except for the fact that he is now taken by my friend Lily and had been a player but "He had grown rom being one of the cutest boys in my class, to being devastatingly handsome. His hair was such a dark brown it was almost black, and even though it was cut short it had  slight curl to it. He had eyes like warm chocolate and his dark lashes and eyebrows showcased them refectory." Ok I'm in love.	You have to love Adam's Jewish family too, they fall for Lily not only is she Jewish but she goes to the same synagogue what more could a Jewish mother want, the phone call when Adam's mum rings Lily's phone had me in stitches look out for it.	A wonderfully written story by someone who not only knows the workings of the court system so it is real but has an amazing sense of humour and a deft hand with romance that makes this a book that is going straight to my favourite shelf, and one that I will be rereading when I need a pick me up and a good laugh.	I received a free copy for an honest review.
0,This just takes the cake,absolutely the most incredible,intriguing,mystery,romance I have read in a while,beautiful story about art and his friend also.couldn't leave it down
0,Great biok
0,I am so sick of the endless self important expletive deleted idiots who piss, bitch, and moan about every typo, grammatical error and their hemmoroids. Review the book or better yet write your own perfect masterpiece.
0,What a wonderful insight into life in a village in France! I felt as if I was right along with the author living in Beaune. Wonderful descriptions of the challenges of life in a foreign country. Been to France once several years ago with my wife and am planning on going back in the near future. Wonderful series of books. I recommend reading all of her Grape series books.
0,Once again enjoyed. NYPD Red..the twists and turns made it difficult to put down. Hope there will be a NYPD Red 4!
0,This is a wonderful debut novel by author Teresa Tysinger. Livy and Jack reunite after many years in the quaint town of Laurel Cove in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains and their relationship is so realistic and heartwarming, as a reader you feel the tug of their emotions. This is a contemporary romance with a captivating and romantic storyline of love and grace. Pour a glass of tea and start reading this book, I guarantee you won't want to stop. I had the privilege to read and review this book, the opinions are strictly my own. I can't wait for the second book by this fantastic author.
0,As a classical music enthusiast for most of my life, I confess I never gave much thought to what a musician endures to earn a seat in a preeminent orchestra.  After reading Patti Niemi's "confessional," I will be thinking about those precarious and rigorous steps every time I take my seat for a concert in Eastman Theatre!  Niemi not only takes us behind the scenes in the life of an aspiring musician, she gets us to feel her struggles and doubts.  Stcking It Out is insightful and entertaining, a double-barreled victory.  I can't wait to read more from this author!
0,Thoughts:  The Mastered Series is one of my absolute favorite series of erotica books  not just because of the authors talent and skill with words and with seduction, but also because of the creativity and the beauty behind it.  For instance in the first two books, Ronins skills with the ropes, just had an intrinsic beauty that was fascinating  and while Unraveled is different, for me there was something even more appealing within the pages.  In Unraveled, we finally get a female dominant.  This added a whole new dynamic, and I loved how Knox really had had to fight with himself on what it meant to be a real man and his shock that someone could actually even think that he would be submissiveand that submissive automatically meant weak.  It was okay for women to be submissive but not for menthe classic double standard.	I have longed to see a female dominant in a book.  I would have enjoyed it simply for that alone, but the fact that it came from Lorelei James made it all the better!  She did an amazing job capturing the realism behind the reactions  not just in the intimate moments, but also in the everyday ones.  Just another example why I love this series!  It just keeps getting better and better!	Overall.dont be fooled or put-off by the fact that Knox is submissive, or the he gives her control in the bedroom. Knox has his dominant moments and he is far from a push-over.  Their relationship is a lot of give and take, and there is a lot of discussion about the boundaries, what they are, and who gets to be boss where.and there are reasons why Shiori is the way she is, and she is a very caring Mistress and seeks to care for those who submit to her.	Take a chance on this one.you won't regret it!	Rate:  A+	Review by: Sarah	http://www.thebookreadinggals.com
0,If you know me at all, or have at least followed my reviews for any length of time you know that I don't read historical romance. Ok, thats a lie because Ive read some but as a general rule, nope, not for me. In fact when I went looking for additional reviewers on my blog one of the criteria was people who read historical since I get a lot of requests for it. I have tried countless times with countless different authors to read historical romance and it never works. Im not crazy about the time periods, the language is often weird to me and I find them boring. Then I got a request for His Mistress and everything changed.		Being married off to a commoner should upset Jane more than resign her but she finds her fathers orchestration to be typical of his disdain for her. With his upcoming marriage he needs Jane out of his hair and his house and she finds herself being thrust into the arms of Tobias, who shes secretly craved for from afar. Her need to dominate and seduce leads her to a secret club where she dons a mask and becomes another person. One who has no insecurities and is stronger than she would be allowed to be in public. When she sees Tobias at the club shes shocked at his need to submit. He doesnt recognize her but responds to her alter-ego with surprising vigor. If he enjoys such activities within the clubs walls, will he submit to her once the secret is out?		The last thing Tobias wants is to get married but blackmail is forcing his hand. Jane has always been quiet and plain but incredibly sweet and he doesnt want to sully her reputation if his extracurricular activities ever came out. The local BDSM club is the only place he can go to release his demons for a short while. The clubs newest female Domme intrigues him the instant he see her and submitting to her becomes his only desire. While she is different than anyone hes ever met, she also seems familiar and Tobias has everything to lose by letting her fully dominate him. Yet he finds thats the only thing he truly wants to do. With his upcoming marriage to Jane, Tobias will have to decide if he can love one woman while craving another.		Never have I been so consumed with a historical romance that I didn't want to put it down. NEVER. Monica Burns has created an erotic and incredibly emotional journey that I didn't want to end!		Janes character is a complex one. She battles herself and what is expected of her every day. She craves control, dominance and to make her own decisions. In a time period where women are obedient and subservient, Jane stands alone. Or so she thinks. She finds happiness behind the doors of her friends elite and very secret BDSM clubs where women rule. With her mask in place she can be whoever she wants. Men will bow at her feet and she can finally grasp the control she most desperately wants. Seeing Tobias there sets off a firestorm of emotions within her. She wants to tell him the truth but he seems only to respond to her alter ego. They enter into a tenuous sexual relationship at the same time her true self is sweetly courting her groom to be. She can tell demons from the past ride Tobias constantly and keep him from fully submitting to her yet he seems unable to let them go. He grapples with himself and his need for both Jane and the woman at the club.		While I found the idea that Tobias didn't recognize her because of a simple mask a bit unbelievable I liked the aspect of Jane being two completely different people. Being able to essentially hide behind her mask gave Jane the power she craves as well as anonymity. As her and Tobias get closer in both her lives Jane finds that her strength is beginning to manifest outside the BDSM world and Tobias is answering in kind with his submission.		I loved this book so much! Jane and Tobias are perfectly suited to each others needs and the journey each takes is profound and emotional. I felt so bad for Janes plight of basically being sold to Tobias and her fathers obvious distaste for having her around. Tobias is a good man but his guilt over his past shackles him. Hes been unable to share his pain with anyone but the mysterious woman at the club beckons him even when shes not around. Tobias slowly learns to trust not only Jane (and her BDSM personality) but also himself, which is the most important aspect.		Monica Burns has created a book that all types of romance readers can enjoy. Her smart and fast track writing kept me thoroughly entertained and never bored. The interaction between characters was seamless and easy as well as engaging. The smoldering sex scenes are well done and leave little to the imagination and are INCREDIBLY HOT. I am so glad I was interested enough in the blurb to take a chance on this one. A female domme set in a historical romance? WHAT?! Give me more!		I give His Mistress by Monica Burns 4.50 stars!

0,The story of a preacher's daughter growing up in a small southern town. She has a dream of moving on, becoming more than a small town girl.
0,I'm looking forward to the next book. I will recommend this to my own kids and grand children. Nothing boring here.
0,This series is a fascinating peek behind the veil of life for a Saudi princess and for women in general in Saudia Arabia as told by a self-admittedly spoiled baby of a large royal family who fights, almost from birth, for her own and other women's rights. it takes a strong stomach to step into this world which can, at times be very brutal, but this trilogy also weaves a rich tapestry of details of their lives, the challenges they face day-to-day and on a political side as the royal house wrestles with the challenges which sudden wealth can present to those who, only a few generations before were living in tents.
0,Loved it.
0,Beautifully written. If you love historical fiction this is great. The writers style is superb.  i look forward to reading more of her books.
0,Rachel Van Dyken how's out done herself with Gabe's story. The Gabe from Ruin is not what we think, he's so much more. Your heart will break for him but then rejoice for him. Rachel weaves such feelings in her stories you can't help but love all of her characters.
0,This is a wonderful companion to the Flat Belly diet book.....the recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients are common.
0,Such a sexy vampire!
0,A really excellent crime debut, dark, clever and immensely readable, Shallow Waters is a gritty and addictive read that will grip you from the outset.		Hannah Robbins is an excellent main protagonist, emotionally resonant and with just enough secrets to embed you into the series  she is driven and very authentic, you will get right behind her. I liked the relationship she had with her reporter boyfriend, it gives an intriguing twist to proceedings and the rest of the cast are well rounded, as an introduction to a new ongoing series this worked perfectly.		It is violent  possibly not for the faint hearted, the mystery element is emotive and very well drawn and will keep you turning those pages to discover the outcome. The police procedural portions of the tale are well rounded and realistic, the pressure and the horror of tracking a killer comes across beautifully. There is a terrific depth to the plotting, especially in relation to allowing the reader to get to know the victim, therefore ensuring that we are as desperate as the police are to catch the villain.		Overall then a really really great read and one that I highly recommend for fans of Crime Fiction. Cant wait to find out what is next for Hannah and Co.		**Source: Author Review Copy**
0,Great Book!!
0,Myra Lynn Kelly is one of those authors that if one of her books is on my TBR list I know I can pick-up and will easily get sucked into.  The Wedding Date Bargain was no exception.  I totally fell for Sarah and Max as a couple and the whole group of friends and really didn't want the book to end.  This was definitely one of those times where I wished this was the second book in an established ten book series, but who am I kidding, I'd be through that in two weeks easily and still have the end of series blues times ten.  My point is that the story is great but the characters are amazing and I highly recommend this book.  I actually did immediately text my friend and tell her she needed to read the first one and then immediately move on to this one, which I typically do not do.
0,This book is the 6th in the Mountain Cove series but it can be read as a stand alone.  Even though there are characters from past books, you will not be confused by their appearance if you haven't read the other books.  This book has non-stop action so be ready to hold on to your seat!  That's what I love about Beth Goddard's books.  She holds the reader's attention with her storylines so well.  In this book you think you know who the villain is right away but there are so many twists and turns that you are constantly wondering if you are right or not!  The story is set in beautiful Alaska but the rugged scenery lends to the story itself as nature creates some of the suspense throughout the book.  There are problems at the waterfalls and the ice caves and the trees and the rivers.  The heroine, Jewel, is being hunted and targeted and she doesn't really know why.  She is constantly being attacked and how she survives all these attacks, I can hardly believe!  Poor woman!  The chief of police, Colin, has always been interested in Jewel but has never acted on those feelings.  Now, however, he won't stand by and see her killed!  He does everything possible to being her attacker to justice.  Open the book and be prepared for a great story and great characters!  It's an awesome read!
0,Great purchase
0,I want to applaud Terry for giving us some amazing insight into how the world of Kahlan and Richard evolved.  Great job.
0,Right from the start, the prologue lets the reader know that a murder has taken place.  But who was the victim?  Who was the murderer? And who stood by and watched it all?  After that dramatic beginning with all those questions running around in your head, the story begins.  Ms. Baylee gives the reader just enough details to keep you guessing who-done-it and just when you think you might have figured it out, you realize that you got it all wrong.  Not until the very end was the killer revealed, and to me, that is what makes this book an excellent read and a solid mystery/thriller.		Stranger at Sunset by Eden Baylee is one of those novels that starts off as a slow burn and gradually builds to an intense inferno.  Ms. Baylee has managed to craft a thrilling and engaging masterpiece that was difficult to put down.  There were so many characters involved with the story, but each one has an integral part that made this story so engrossing.  With vivid descriptions of Jamaica and of the resort, I really felt that I was right there in the action.  This was an amazing and intense psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and I would recommend it to anyone!		*I was provided a copy of this book via the author in exchange for an honest review.
0,Don,t remember story, but I read it so I most have enjoyed	SLEEP TIGHT..
0,I have loved the entire series and this one didn't disappoint.  I felt so many emotions during different parts of the story, and I am so sad that it's finished!!!
0,I love this book, it is full of wonderful nuggets of information that I always was curious about like "why does Missouri have a nub?". This is a well researched book and I highly recommend it.
0,You can't go wrong with the Bronte sisters when in the mood for a romantic novel. The characters are complex and compelling.
0,One of the most inspiring books I  have read. I would highly recommend  to anyone.
0,This book seemed more intense it seem that Goldie was more obsessed than usual. the book was well-written. I rushed to finish the book because I knew they were planning on having a baby and I wanted to see if there was any indication this was the last book
0,loved book 2, now im reading book 3. Highly recommend! very addicting books.
0,At first this book seemed a bit heavy but as I got into it, there was a wealth of information.
0,Great book, full of stories
0,I was so happy when Dre came back and he came back a better person and I love it
0,Kids love these books. Chances are if they have the first, they'll want the second and so on. Go ahead and get them all. ;)
0,Great characters! Great storyline! Great writing! :) Loved it!
0,Awhile I appreciated the great writing of the author I found myself almost feeling voyueristic? the spiritual journey of a Native American boy.it was a raw sad story and in the end I felt like I did not belong here.
0,I really enjoyed the time period and the setting of this book. The protagonists are Luke Callahan, a US Representative from Maine and Anne O'Brien, a Librarian in the Library of Congress. While I love historical fiction, mixing in a strong dose of American Government only makes it more enjoyable for me. The dialogue between Luke and Anne is great fun, making for such sweet character development. I really adored the snarkiness of Anne, and by snarky, I mean hilarious. Obvious thought and hard work went into her lines by the author. Well done. Lukes personality is great fun, too. I love how he generally refers to Anne as OBrien. I also found Lukes background and family to be very intriguing. While I've never been to Maine, this book really makes me want to visit.		What I didn't care for  the pacifism of Luke. While the author attempts to make this ideology to be valiant and brave, it doesn't work me. Adhering to the history, setting, and romance, makes this book an entertaining read.		I received a copy of this book from the publisher, through The Book Club Network (bookfun.org) in exchange for my honest review.
0,WoW! This book is Amazing!! It is so Awesome!!! Bernie, what can I say he is just adorable! I think him of my baby brother and wanted to smack Billy the Bully. All the characters Suzie, sissy(she is cute! Ye! Ye!) then Lenny and Alcandor.	I am thinking now too, if some world of Gods exists. Throughout the story I was thinking that, this is really cool! When I read the synopsis I though it would be nice but the story blew me away! The story line hooked me and I liked it to be from other character's POV to know what was happening.	I liked the idea of Lookies, Bernie sent on his Universe. Bernie he is just, has soft heart and that's what I love about him, caring for everything and not blinking out.	And also enjoyed the short story of Bernie ans Billy's fight, from the link at the end of the book!	Looking forward to read what next will happen. Must Read book!	And I got the e-copy in exchange of an honest review.
0,I had just finished reading the Watchers Trilogy by Katrice and love it  I wanted to continue reading, so I started the Witch Avenue Series.  Read Lonely Souls just based on the previous books by Katrice Bolton.  I knew nothing about it, just started reading.  And Loved It.  The main Characters Triss and Logan are young kids brought up in the world of magic.  When things start to go wrong, all they have is each other.  Lots of twists and turns and lots of laughter.  Awesome book!  This is good, Altered Souls is better and Released Souls is great!  Check it out for for yourselve.  Good clean fun reading that will leave you wanting more.
0,I had occasion to buy from Rags to Riches while I was in Abu Dhabi on business.  I found the book well written by a close friend of the Sheik.  Of course he is biased in the sheiks favor.  They grew up together and Mr. Fahim is one of the people who literally went from rags to riches due to the Sheik's gifts, which were distributed to the entire population, according to Mr. Fahim.	To me it is staggering that a remarkable modern kingdom today had no paved roads in 1968.  Amazing.	To understand Abu Dhabi I would certainly recommend this well written book
0,As with all of the other books by Debora Geary, the books have just the right amount of detail without being boring and good story lines to keep you interested.  The characters  are interesting people you only wish you could have as friends - who wouldn't want to "teleport", etc. ?  This was another "great escape"!
0,OMG, I was flipping the pages the millisecond I finished a page. Talk about a surprising development, but I don't do spoilers so I can only say so much. The action, danger, the fear all comes through the pages. Am I sorry the book is short and ends in a cliff hanger, yes. But the review I'm doing is based on the story and how I feel about it. IT WAS TERRIFIC and all I have to say is I hope book 3 is at least halfway written and oh yeah, I'm available for Beta reading.
0,Great book
0,I am hopelessy overtaken when I open up a book of Harry Potter!  I must say that I liked this one even better than the first, and I hope that the  series conitnues in this path.  There are more moments of magic, mystery,  and excitement to be found once again.  It is nice to open up the book and  see that you are returning to Harrys life that you came to know so well in  the first.  I like the further development of the beloved characters, and  there is never a dull minute while reading this second book.  I highly  reccomend this book if you fell in love with the first one!  Great read for  all ages.
0,This is the first of three novels E.R.B. wrote about the island of Caspak the three books are among the best E.R.B. has written and that saying alot. If you get a chance pick this one up it is a great adventure and the best of the trilogy "the people that time forgot",& "Out of times abyss" are the follow ups to this exiting adventure all are great storys and all can be injoyed being read independently but I would incurage you to read all three. out of the huge bulk of E.R.B.s work only Tarzan, The Barsoom series and This the Caspak series have recieved atention from hollywood hopefully with C.G.I. more of E.R.B.s work will hit the big screen It would be nice to see this trilogy redone with todays special effects.
0,An Amazon free ebook that captured my imagination and attention. A single Mom who recently experienced the end of a 25 year marriage to a philanderer. Feeling invisible as she finds it difficult to reconnect to feeling desirable, she decides to use this invisibility to investigate who murdered the man left in her mother's garage and set her house on fire. So begins this story with a well-developed and highly believable cast of characters.
0,Through her personal stories and metaphors for life, Feinberg creates a wonderful set of chapters to meditate on and push you to grow in your relationship with God.  It has several fun features too--an offer to correspond over email about what you love about Jesus, a song list, reading ideas, and quirky footnotes.  I read this book in two days it was so great and engaging.  Now I need to go back and read it again!  As a single woman--this book really helped me put God back in the husband spot in my heart.  Thank you!
0,Liked the story, but wish the order of the books were a little clearer.  I have the same quest as asked in the book, were are they why have they not make contact yet, or is it because we are not ready.
0,This was a series of short stories, but all connected. The reason I didn't give it a 5 was much of it was about past Torchwood. It was exciting and did involve time travel. Always a plus.
0,Very good ideas for gourd crafting and nice colorful pictures.  Very good for beginners and above.  Would recommend to all.
0,wow
0,I love the stories that Grace Walton writes . My heart was pounding through the whole book ! Read her books, you will love them !!!!!!
1,This book was all over the place.  The writing didn't grab me and I found my mind wandering, which never happens in a good book.  I was 75% into the book and still didn't know where the story was going.  I was just hoping it would end soon.  The story says that a book is only as good as its last page.  I didn't like the last page or the 400+ pages it took to get there.  My rating has nothing to so with the subject matter, only the writing.  I felt nothing in this book.
1,I have owned several of these "Dummies" books, but on this one, I had to ask myself why I bothered. This book has nothing new or revolutionary to offer. I can't imagine it helping anyone learn to sell any better. It says "7 books in 1" but none of them are worth much. If you really need help selling, look elsewhere.
1,Freud may or may not have been a creative genius.  Whatever else he was, however, he was enormously clever and remarkably well informed, with access to an astonishingly broad and diverse range of references.  Moreover, he had an uncanny ability to pluck as needed from his well-stocked head a suitable allusion, concept, image, or idea to make whatever point he wanted to make.  He was a prodigiously skillful ethnographer of the psyche, an activity that included the interpretation of dreams.		Freud worked as one steeped in classical scholarship and also thoroughly knowledgeable in the science and practice of the medicine of his time.  The latter body of knowledge included more scholarly material and sustained research concerning mental illness than many of us realize.  Freud, moreover, was a capable practitioner who brought relief and even recovery to those suffering from a variety of neurotic symptoms, or so he reports, and I see no reason to doubt him, though he does seem unwaveringly committed to the notion that he's always right, a characteristic that might diminish his effectiveness just a bit.		Nevertheless, I found The Interpretation of Dreams to be very disappointing.  This may be due to the fact that my previous knowledge of Freud was limited to textbook accounts, which are often unreliable and seldom capable of capturing the genuinely brilliant insights of world-class scientists and scholars.  Perhaps I was unprepared to appreciate Freud in anything stronger than a textbook distillation.		I think, however, that there is a more serious problem, one that is intrinsic to Freud's work and pervasive in mainstream social and behavioral science even today.  Freud was a functionalist.  In this instance that means that once he concluded that all dreams were instances of wish-fulfillment, he unduly constrained his interpretations, and he made excruciatingly heavy demands on his interpretative powers.  Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to maintain the claim that all dreams functioned to serve this one end.		By way of analogy, imagine that Freud was a contemporary ethnographer interested in the way schools work rather than what dreams mean.  Imagine further that he proceeds from the assumption that all schools are organized in a merit-based way, producing young people who have been selected, sorted, educated, and allocated in accordance with their innate intelligence.  There would be no surprise, then, when observing an elementary school classroom, his practiced eye and fine-tuned ear affirmed that assignment to ability groups was indeed made according to what Freud took to be intelligence.  His meritocratic assumption seems correct.		However, suppose another observer of the same classroom noted that there was also a very close connection between family income and ability group placement.  This might be construed as suggesting that money brings advantages that may make affluent students seem smarter than they are, while the intelligence of students from families with little money is masked.  Just like that, Freud's assumption that elementary schools function in a merit-based way is faced with a plausible alternative.		At this point, Freud can either acknowledge that his functionalist deductions may have been wrong, or he can creatively argue that income is a good proxy for intelligence, say after the fashion of Herrnstein and Murray in their much celebrated and much maligned book The Bell Curve.  Eventually, moreover, Freud will be forced to do the same kind of intellectual contortions with regard to race, gender, number of parents in the home, ethnicity, region of the country, urban or rural residence, and a whole host of other factors that are confounded with merit in the form of innate ability.  Why should these seemingly extraneous factors serve as disguised indicators of brain power?  Exactly the sort of conundrum that mainstream sociologists of education and educational psychologists find themselves facing today.		Given Freud's demonstrated ability to come up with a seemingly endless collection of self-serving interpretations, however strained, stretched, and willfully contrived they may have been, he'd probably do quite well.  The fact remains, however, that once he makes an all-embracing assumption -- that dreams function as wish-fulfillment, that schools function as meritocracies, that religion functions to assure social solidarity, ... -- he has boxed himself in.  His interpretations have to serve the function he has assigned them.  If his assumption was correct, it's all to the good, narrowing the scope of material with which he must deal.  If he was wrong, however, he's in trouble.		I found many of Freud's dream interpretations tortured, twisted, convoluted, wildly implausible, and unregulated in any way as to what constitutes suitable evidence.  If Freud had been less clever and his cultivated intelligence had been less well stocked with variegated substance from every domain of knowledge imaginable, I think he would have been forced to concede that he was wrong.  But Freud made what I take to be an erroneous assumption and then outsmarted himself, giving incorrect interpretations to dreams because of his initial dubious assumption as to the function of wish-fulfillment.		Freud is to be commended for introducing extremely interesting and useful concepts such as censoring, resistance, over-determination, condensation, displacement, and dream work, and for helping us understand how these notions mediate the connections between the manifest and latent content of dreams.  Nevertheless, his bottomless grab bag of obscure references, abetted by his too-often stream-of-consciousness writing style, enabled him to make a case that all dreams function as wish-fulfillment.  The case was often very weak, however, and his technique was inconsistent, sometimes using the dreams of psycho-neurotics and other times discounting them as aberrant.  Truth be told, Freud's method of dream interpretation was constrained only by his unbridled functionalist cleverness.		Yes, some dreams may function as wish-fulfillment, but it seems abundantly clear that many do not.  Why Freud tied his brilliance to this dubious assumption escapes me.  In any case, I give him credit for stubborn determination and boundless ingenuity.
1,Here is an example of the idiocy of UFO nutcases:		We actually believe that there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children who were kidnapped and sent into space on a 20-year ride, Robert David Steele said during a winding, conspiratorial dialogue with Alex Jones, the right-wing nut-job.		Can you believe this? This book is in the same vein. Bogus stories about things that never happened!		Read legitimate history. Get a life!
1,The Illustrated Guide to Edible Wild Plants offers a good description of wild edible plants. Easy reading, very thorough and detailed.
1,Read Maggie Shayne's Wings in the Night trilogy? Want to hear more about her vampire heroes? Well, this book does offer the opportunity - at least, in part. But it falls far short of the original Wings in the Night stories and of the initial follow-up volume, At Twilight.	In this collection, we have a new novella, Run from Twilight, and another reissue, Twilight Vows. In Run from Twilight, Mary is being targetted by a serial killer. Michael Grey appears from nowhere, it seems, and he claims that he's protecting Mary - but is he the killer? Michael is a vampire who was mortally wounded at the height of Al Capone's `reign' in Chicago, but he was transformed at the point of death by Cuyler Jade of Beyond Twilight. The most melodramatic point of this book is when Michael's wife, Sally, shoots herself in front of him, apparently unable to reconcile herself either to his death or to his `resurrection' as a vampire.	The Michael and Mary story certainly has its moments, and it was intriguing to see that the investigation organisation Mary contacts is run by Maxine, Lou and Stormy, the more likeable characters from Twilight Hunger. Disappointingly, still Shayne hasn't furthered the romantic plot regarding Lou and Maxine. Anyway, I was enjoying Michael and Mary's story until suddenly - WHAM - it was over, at a point where I was expecting at least 20 more pages to finish the romance and the general storyline in a more satisfying manner.	Twilight Vows, the reissue, is set in Ireland - and it's advisable to read this *before* reading Twilight Hunger, given the major spoiler in Hunger which affects this novella. Rachel Sullivan has been fascinated all her life by the legend of the two vampires who once lived in the castle. However, she never expected that one of them, at least, was still alive. So when Donovan O'Roark walks into her pub, she is astounded. Even then, though, she takes him for a descendant of the original Donovan - until, after she follows him to the castle and wangles herself an invitation to stay the night, she discovers the truth: he really is a vampire.	Like most American authors writing Irish characters, Shayne wildly exaggerates Irish speech rhythms and dialect; as an Irish person I felt embarrassed reading it. No-one says `Lord `a mercy'; the expression is `Lord have mercy'. Many of her other faintly-phonetic renderings fall short of the mark. And I wonder who advised her on Irish names? Donovan is never, in Ireland at any rate, used as a first name; it is a surname. And Donovan's surname is properly spelt O'Roarke.	Again, as with Run from Twilight, this novella was over-short. Donovan went from denying that Rachel meant anything to him to realising that he loved her in far too short a time, and we saw nothing about his own feeling about her in years gone by, given that he'd watched over her since her childhood. Shayne did this much better with regard to Eric and Tamsin in Wings in the Night. Again, the story needed another 20 pages or so at the end to finish it properly, too.	Overall, this collection needed at least another 50 pages to be worthwhile. The stories in Wings in the Night worked because they were long enough to cover what needed to be covered; the romances were satisfying, and we also saw more of the characters in later books, which equally helped to round off the stories. These novellas, as well as being too short, gave us far too little of characters from earlier books (nothing at all in Twilight Vows), so that hook wasn't present either.	A very disappointing sequel, just as Shayne's Twilight Hunger, her first novel-length story - was disappointing. I just hope that her latest offering, Embrace the Twilight - another novel-length story, is better!	wmr-uk
1,Mr. Macdonald is now in the company of the Nazis and the Islamofascists, of those who preach hatred of the Jews.		True, he does not say this directly. But what he does in effect is try to argue that Jews are anti-Gentile, that this is the heart of their ' evolutionary strategy'(nu?) and that this leads to resentment hatred, and  murder of Jews.		He in doing this ignores wholly the fundamental teachings of Judaism which teach that every human being is created in the image of God, and is thus of infinite value.		He ignores the fact that the most frequently mentioned commandment in the Jewish Bible is the one about honoring and respecting strangers because the Jews who were strangers in Egypt understand this kind of suffering.		He ignores the fact that among the great Jewish contributions to mankind is the idea of equality before the law.		And while ignoring the heart of Jewish teaching he also ignores the facts of Jewish history.		If Jews are so ' successful ' in evolutionary terms why is it that the Jews who numbered five to eight million people , one out of every ten citizens of the Roman Empire today are less than two tenths of one percent of mankind as a whole. That is had the Jews simply grown at the same rate as the world's population they would be over two - hundred million today, and not around thirteen million.		Jews would not be the Chinese but they would be among the larger peoples of mankind.		Another important area of distinction which escapes the author is that between the actions of individual Jews and that of those acting for the benefit of the Jewish community. The great majority of ' prominent Jews' have no direct relation to action for the Jewish community. And as Hannah Arendt pointed out often their ' prominence' works against the Jewish community as a whole.		One more point. To talk about Jewish successful 'evolutionary strategy' in the same century when over one- third of the Jewish people were murdered is obscene.		The Jews are the only people who have not replaced their losses from the time of the Second World War.		So where is their ' evolutionary numerical success'?		On the other hand , the Jews can say that among their contributions to mankind is the transmission of the idea of One Creator God who relates to each individual human being with love and consideration.		This teaching is however one which the author of this particular piece of hate- literature chooses to reject.		Instead of this work I strongly recommend readers look at  works by two non- Jewish writers, Thomas Cahill's "Gifts of the Jews" and Paul Johnson's "History of the Jews" These works also have the advantage of being in readable prose.
1,I think my rating of this book is due to something much more than just disappointment. I wish I could say it was because Im not a big fan of sci-fi, but I hardly doubt thats it, since I was really interested in the sci-fi parts of the story. I really enjoyed reading about all the space aspects in the story, and was entertained for the most part.		Jeth is a pretty good fleshed out character, too. I liked his interactions with the crew and the fact that they all seemed a great family. I loved seeing such strong friendships within the book.		If Im going to attribute my indifference to this book on something, it could be the romance that was thrown in here. I feel like there are moments when a love story can be added, and moments when it shouldnt, and in this book, I feel like a love story shouldnt have been added. Jeths main goal is to get Avalon back and help his crew, so why cant you stick to that? Adding a romantic interest (which was frankly annoying) to the story was really unnecessary and it really made me lose interest in the book.		I could also say that my indifference is due to the writing. This book was narrated in third person. This led to everything sounding really detached. I found I couldn't give a crap about most of the things happening because I couldn't connect emotionally to the story.		Last aspect of this book that irked me was the predictability. Jeth and his Crew-trusted people they shouldnt have, constantly made the wrong decisions, and never learned from their rash, impulsive actions. For them being portrayed as some badass teenage mercenaries, youd think theyd have more common sense.		Overall, I could say that I was pretty underwhelemed by this story. I'll maybe read the sequel to see how the story ends.		Rating: 2.5 stars
1,All things being equal, I would have called this effort "a solid C".  Except for the opening, there's absolutely nothing original in it, but it's well written and there's some good dialogue.  The H/h are interesting, and I actually liked them quite a lot.  However, once they have sex, the prose escalates beyond purple to ultra violet in its description of the characters' emotions.  It was so bad at around 80% I couldn't read any more, so I skimmed ahead to check out the HEA and then quit.  I'm not sure if I'll read any more of Kasey Michaels.
1,I didn't much care for this book, hence the two stars. If you ever tried reading some of these sentences out loud you might die from shortness of breath, assuming of course that you follow normal rules and don't breath while it's still the same sentence. Seriously, some sentences have upwards of 6 or 7 semicolons. If you're reading it as literature, you might like it more than I did because I wasn't trying to find deep, double meanings in the crown, surka, etc.		Aerin's a cool enough character, but there's not all that much character development that's actually believable. ***spoiler alert*** She does change, but that's because in order to save her life, Luthe dumps her in the lake that makes her something more than mortal. Yet, after all that arduous traveling and fighting the big bad evil mage she gets pulled back to the present, sleeps with Luthe, then heads back home to take the fight to the northerners. When the kingdom's saved at last, she marries the guy who's loved her all her life, yet still thinks of Luthe. And it's all okay in her mind because she's "more than mortal" now so she can wait for Luthe later. Oy, I wanted a fantasy story, not a soap opera.		Tor is so under-appreciated. I wish the author spent a bit more time fleshing out his character. I happy, go-lucky princeling type character is so overused in fantasy.		The part where Aerin trains to slay dragons is okay. Her epic fight with Maur is cool. The end battle where they're all fighting off the depression Maur is pressing down upon their spirits is just blah.		Ironically, those who are going to like this most are the dig-deeper types. Those who just want a fun story are going to be sorely disappointed, I think. Also, it's a very dense read. The sentence structure isn't always conducive to easing the reader along. My opinion of the dialogue varies. No part of it left me duly impressed or annoyed.		Overall, I expected a lot better.
1,I am really having a hard time understanding why people find the main character Andy to be "lovable". He is absolutely disgusting in every way - self-absorbed, immature, whiny, foul-mouthed, weak, lazy ...  This book is neither funny nor dramatic. It is a soap opera in which all the adults act like HS and college age fools.  If that is entertaining for you, go for it. Fortunately, I cannot relate to anyone in this book. I have no friends or family or even acquaintances who behave like these immoral and classless people!
1,Larry Diamond wonders in one section of the book why the USA didn't stop Iraqi massacres of some of it's own population in 1991. I give him the answer. The USA was still a little paralyzed from the militarily-crippling antiwar demonstrations of the late 1960's early 70's. Those demonstrators made it hard for the USA to use the american army, navy, air force and marine corps in any kind of fight. True we used the military in Desert Storm but only till the Iraqis were out of Kuwait. Taking over Iraq in 1991 was too sure to bring heavy US civilian protesting movements. By 2003 the former 60's protester were too old or had passed away or were now too involved in their own lives to take such an active part in organizing effective demonstration movements.
1,In giving an honest review, I must say that I imagine most people would be somewhat disappointed with this book, though it is not downright terrible by any means.		There is not much information presented. The first 16 pages of content are very basic information on spells. More detailed information on such basic things as what a spell is, how the moon might be involved and so on are free throughout the internet.		I also have qualms with a stance taken by the author. They claim that love spells are 'white magic' spells, or in other words that controlling others is ethically acceptable, simply because the subject is love, and love is a good thing. I'm not sure if this is a flimsy justification for the guilty mind or just very poor logic, to put it gently. Either way the novice witch should be informed in a more honest and straightforward fashion than this, so that they can do what they will - but as informed decisions, not rationalized blurry lines.		I disagree with a few more little things here and there, but I'm not going to nitpick it to death, because:		The bulk of the book is simply various spells, and this is indeed a 'book of spells,' so this should be the weight of the review. Even here, though, I can't bring myself to award more than two stars. The spells are extremely simplistic. Some of them are nothing more than saying a sentence and wanting it to be true.		For example, the 'Realistic Dream Spell' involves relaxing and finding inner peace (no more detail than this is given), and then saying, "I like my thoughts and I like my dreams, so let me make my feel real," before going to bed. And that's the entire spell. I'm not sure if this particular spell was a typo, or if 'feel' was meant as a noun.		Another example, the 'Cold Fighting Spell' is simply yelling about how much you hate having a cold and telling the cold to go away.		A lot of the spells are of 'themes' that I also personally don't find appealing, only considering far more useful or important themes that could have been in their place. While this is largely subject to my personal opinion, some themes include: a slew of love spells (like getting a lover back and so on), confidence spells, hair spells, dieting spells, etc.		I very much dislike coming across as condescending or harsh, but honestly this book was just not that great in my opinion. Perhaps it could serve as a very lighthearted beginners book.		I know that for a lot of people that the intention and personal power behind a spell is of the greatest importance, and so perhaps yelling at your cold with enough passion and focus could count as a spell. I tend to follow the philosophy to an extent, but this just seemed in a way sort of childish to me.
1,"Meh," is my first response, to be honest. Abbott gives us a pretty rote story of mean girls (think Heathers, crossed with Mean Girls, all wrapped up in Carrie, and you'll be in the ballpark), tosses in a murder 'mystery' and some cliches about cheerleaders and disconnected parents, and stirs it all up with a dash of snark and a soupcon of purple prose. *shrug*		The sections about the squad stepping up their game, under the tutelage of a new coach, were actually pretty interesting. It's nice to see cheer recognized as the sport it really is. I would gladly have read a book about that process. Abbott, however chooses to go down another path, creating a world entirely peopled by cardboard characters and unbelievable dialogue. She has hints of a good writer, and some of her phrasing was lovely... until she spun off on wildly Faulknerian rambles. Not a single character rang true for me--cartoon villains.		This novel is hard to quantify, as well. The girls are in high school (though they don't act or relate to each other as kids), setting it squarely in YA territory, but the level of violence and sexuality makes it highly inappropriate for the kids at whom it seems to be aimed. I think it will be popular with 'Women of a Certain Age', the demographic that drives fanfictions about kids who act like jaded forty year olds at seventeen, and who want to believe they were THAT COOL in high school. Add in a whiff of lesbianism for titillation, and you might have a middle ager hit.		Just don't believe the reviews that claim it is a better mystery than "Gone Girl", because it's not.
1,Disorganized writing reflecting the mind behind it...I got a headache everytime I picked it up.  While there are some interesting things presented--if you can pick them out of the abyss of chaotic thinking--there is little to satisfy the truly critical thinker.  A waste of everybody's time.
1,Not nearly as good as the first in the series.  I found myself skipping past long, boring, unrealistic stories that were meant to be funny and just were not.
1,Billed for this unordered book, again
1,Not a good resource. It is the old paradigm that fat causes us to get fat. Not worth reading.
1,It was very well written don't get me wrong but I just couldn't get into it, and even thought about skipping over parts - but a friend recommend it so unstuck with it and I just couldn't get excited about it.
1,I admit I had high expectations for this book after having read The Surprising Purpose of Anger by the same author.  However, unlike that book which is at the same time accessible and profound, this book is repetitive and trite.  The entire point of the conversation (it's in  question and answer format) is that within everyone is a "blessed divine energy" that is only accessed when we allow ourselves to experience feelings and needs, both our own and other people's, without judgement or evaluation.  There are better explorations of how to do this in Rosenberg's other books.  I can't help but 'judge' that this book is geared toward the new age crowd that likes to have practical advice sugar coated in mystical language, as if simply calling something "blessed" and "divine" somehow automatically elevates both the message and the reader.
1,I am so sorry, I can't even finish this book. This is very rare for me as I will usually stick it out till the end no matter what, but not this time.	The novel starts well enough, a damaged girl, a greedy father, a sympathetic doctor and interesting characters around her. Then suddenly give her super powers and her attorney is gleeful because now women can truly fight back.	I felt like I was watching an episode of "Heroes" but surrounded by great in depth storylines and characters. Maybe I'm wrong and I rarely leave bad reviews but honestly, this is more along the line of "Twilight, or "The Hunger Games". Probably a great Tween Novel.
1,I decided to start this series at the beginning having read so many wonderful reviews of the books and thinking I would have a great time and many fun hours working my way through the numerous volumes devoted to the crimes being solved by the Pitts.	I am SO disappointed! These books are repetitive to the nth degree and in my opinion, Charlotte does not get nearly enough word play.	The settings are so far always the same few, upper-class neighborhoods and the characters are the same haughty, annoyed, uncooperative snobs.	Over and over and no one can ever remember Thomas Pitt's name because as a policeman he is SO beneath them.	I know Anne Perry is a very successful writer and certainly has no cause to listen to me, but I wish she had utilized more of the "Oliver Twist" world, the time period in which this series is set, developed a richer relationship between Thomas and Charlotte and moved beyond the veneers represented by the oh so proper social constraints of the times.	Yes, she does set a rich period tone, but it's just the same over and over and over.	I've read my last book of this series.
1,I returned this book. There just was so little of interest in it. Not many recipes and poor picture quality. I did better finding recipes on Pinterest and printing those.
1,For someone who hasn't read the early Pendergast books, this might seem like a halfway decent stab at a cop book by some fledgling writers. For those who have, its a further descent into oblivion.		Bodies are beginning to crop up in New York  just bodies, not their heads  so naturally, the NYPD is on the job. The reasoning for involving the FBI and Pendergast is tenuous.		The investigators move from case to case with the flow of the murders, gleaning almost nothing. As though this wasn't tedious enough, the writers weave in a preachy political message. In this process, the clever and insightful Pendergast we once knew is nowhere to be found. The cipher in this tale stumbles and mumbles around, contributing little or nothing. It is only after the killer reveals himself does our hero claim to have solved it. The claim is lame as he doesnt seem to have had adequate information and readers certainly weren't well informed.		The revelation is fomented by a trap set by the villain for Pendergast, the head of the police investigation and the agent in charge of the New York FBI office. Its hard to decide if the trap is more obvious than the supposedly expert prey are obtuse. But, this does set up a showdown between the protagonist and antagonist in which Pendergast displays all the combat acumen of a teenage Quaker. His final ploy defies credibility.		The early Pendergast novels were brilliant, skillfully blending vivid characters, intriguing plots and just the right dash of the supernatural. This has almost none of that and barely surpasses pulp fiction.
1,I thought I was getting a book  I can't  use this
1,Alright! Almost $20 for a book that is inked throughout and looks like it's been dunked in coffee and water. The cover looks like it was folded over itself several times... All in all it an embarrassment made worse by the privledge of paying for this "acceptable".		I guess my standards are just too high...
1,As a mental health professional, the concept of this book was intriguing. Unfortunately, as the title suggests, this book was in fact written by a sociopath and it is readily apparent that the author does not care about his or her audience. Reading this is comparable to reading the DSM, if the DSM had characters. The author included little anecdotes about her life growing up, going to college and law school, and professional career, but then gets away from the story to philosophize about how her sociopathy affected her decisions in various stages of her life. This wouldn't be so bad if the philosophizing didn't significantly outweigh the actual anecdotes about her life. I was easily bored and truth be told could not actually finish this book because of its tediousness and monotony. I received a free copy of this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for an honest review.
1,The book was great when it described her work in the one room school, and her life in the one room shack, which made the inhabitants get there water supply from the creek nearby.  From then on it was tedious and thin on detail.
1,I was intrigued about the story but just found it severely lacking... I liked the writing style, alternating between past and present, which helped provide the back story. The main character's quest just seemed too easy, in part due to the brevity with which the author portrayed both the characters and the events.
1,The physical book itself completely feel apart. The binding came apart and I could not finish reading the book. Very disappointing!
1,I usually buy for my kindle but, thought this sounded interesting, so I purchased in paperback.  Huge disappointment.  Very slow and highly repetitive writing.  I gave up on it one-third of the way through.  The main characters had no emotional appeal he/she.  The indecision was ridiculous on the part of Elizabeth of Lancaster.  I hoped this would be an interesting read on the few women who are written about in this time period.  I was wrong.  Unless your into drivel, save your time and money.
1,I am a 70's throwback ! So if you've read "The Omen" books or saw the movies & Read or saw " The Exorcist " this book is nothing NEW!	I've read some of Mr. Johnstons books and enjoyed them but this one just landed with a dull thud!	Save your money for the next King book coming out in May!
1,This book sucked. It was poorly written and had no information other than the author's opinion. It ends with no resolution
1,There are better cases to feature.  My son had a summer assignment re: key Supreme Court cases.  Only some were described in this book.  I took Constitutional Law in law school.  This is just ok.
1,I thought this would draw me in more because of the musical nature of the story. However, it just didn't donut for me.
1,The book was not well written.
1,I've read all the previous books in The Mortal Instruments series, and after finishing CITY OF FALLEN ANGELS, the overwhelming thought I had when I closed the book was: she should have stopped at book 3.  The The impossible love between Clary and Jace has been the driving force of the first three books.  And honestly the incestuous obstacle to their romance has always been a real hindrance to my enjoyment of the series overall.  I knew eventually it would be revealed that somehow they weren't actually related, and I had to cling fiercely to that thought every time they started making out thinking they were brother and sister, but it was big on the ick scale even still and I think that particular storyline was drawn out much too long.  But after such a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to their love no longer exists, what could possibly trump incest in CITY OF FALLEN ANGELS?		The answer, unfortunately, is nothing.		But Clary and Jace still act like their love is impossible.  Jace brings new meaning to the word brooding.  His objections to being with Clary felt very thin to me and her response was overly melodramatic.  I haven't been able to loose myself in this series really since the first book, but I felt especially detached from this one.  It didn't help that half the book was devoted to Simon's perspective and his ongoing struggle to come to grips with his new life as a vampire.  He's never been a strong enough character to hang a book on in my opinion, and he proves that in CITY OF FALLEN ANGELS.		Bottom-line, the Jace/Clary parts of the book were unsuccessfully trying to recreate the romantic tension they had in the previous books, and the Simon parts just weren't interesting enough to warrant the page time he got.  Yes, there is a plot involving demons and murdered Shadowhunters, but with all the characters faux drama, it fell flat me. Diehard fans of the series will no doubt love this latest installment, but if you've been lukewarm like me, you might want to pass and try Cassandra Clare's Infernal Devices prequel series instead.		Sexual Content:	Kissing. References to homosexuality.
1,How does one review a zombie novel that contains few, if any, zombies?  W.Greatshell's "Xombies", while peopled on the periphery of the novel's action with virtually unstoppable hordes of Xombies (reanimated people Xisting on a higher level of the evolutionary ladder), is devoid of any significant zombie-on-human action through much of the story.  The Xistence of the Xombies acts as an impetus for the protagonists to flee in their nuclear submarine to the Xombie-unfriendly wastes of the Arctic circle.  There they discover a comic-booky enclave of humanity undertaking last ditch efforts to stem the Xombie tide, though in ways that might not be in the best interest of humanity.		The Xombies emerged from the activities of a viral strain that initially affected women with active menstrual cycles (so menopausal women, little girls and genetic abnormalities like our heroine Lulu are immune from the initial infection, though they and all men could still succumb to a Xombie's "kiss").  This is a cliche done to death already in Werewolf, Vampire and Fantasy fiction, so why not here as well, right?  But Greatshell's interesting conception quickly falls into  narrative pieces.		Lulu and her mother are attacked by Xombies while staying in a boarded-up summer community in Rhode Island (in the best tradition of "Clicker"'s Phillipsport, Maine).  It is quickly discovered that bashing them with cars, braining them with tools, shooting them in the face dozens of times, cutting them into little pieces, using explosives, poisoning them and spraying napalm all over them have only limited effect in hindering them, and do not kill them.  The infected, more like mutant smurfs on sci-fi overcharged steroids, quickly drive our survivors to a supersecret Air Force base in the arctic.		And this is where Greatshell's novel begins to hit the wall.  The Xombies are simply too powerful to provide any level of suspense in the story or to enable the author to continue along the lines of a prototypical, excellent zombie novel.  The Xombies are as "high-concept" or "literary" as a zombie could be. The story reverts from a zombie survival tale to a disingenuously overt, snarky, hipster version of Lord of the Flies that might have been better left to its graphic novel form, truth be told.  Any of the gore, violence, grittiness and desparation of the standard zombie tale have largely been Xcised.  Xombies become "Big Metaphors", humanity succumbs to being "Semiotic Representations" and the readers learn "Universal Lessons About Life, Love and the Human Condition".		And Greatshell then quickly flounders in this new turn as well.  Whereas a Golding or even a skilled satirist might have used Greatshell's super-secret arctic base to really tap into the perversity and self-defeat of modern organized government and western society, Greatshell pushes the story to a certain limited point and then sloppily ties it together in a fantastical ending with the re-emergence of the Xombies.		The only saving graces for this novel (from the perspective of both the zombie genre as well as political satire/social commentary) were the excellent writing, haunted imagery and the verve, willfulness, spunk and attitude he lovingly imparts to our heroine Lulu.  Most of the other characters in the work fail to really touch any kind of chord with the reader or else have such ambiguous roles in and import to the development of the story that the reader, sighing in frustration at the obvious effort Greatshell put into fleshing out their story lives and deaths, is left confused and not a little bored.		Overall, I would suggest not purchasing "Xombies" unless you are a true zombie fan and desire to taste the fruits of some truly tepid, literary zombie horror.
1,This book contains a great deal of helpful information but instead of presenting the material is some progression it seems to dump volumes of information on you all at once.  The introduction chapter (Overview of CherrpyPy) is anything but.  I would recommend a few diagrams showing how CherryPy is architected and a simple example which can be enhanced in subsequent chapters.  Instead, the author launches into a multipage Python example (titled basic example) without describing what the end goal is and how he is working toward it.  It is very easy to get lost in the details.		Unfortunately, there are not many alternatives out there as far as books go.
1,It is not my style.  Wasted pages for coloring and hard to do searches.
1,Book has a simple plot and the 50 50 story line is so overdone that it lost all credibility.  When there are two possible outcomes, the odds are rarely ever 50 50.  Bad logic and bad story line.  Lastly, if the woman was so perfect, Teacher could have shown a little more flexibility.
1,Granted, I started reading this just after finishing Jonathan Franzen's book "Freedom," which a tough act to follow but this book, "Driftwood Lane: A Nantucket Love Story" by Denise Hunter, is a true lightweight, almost like a comic book.  I only got through 3 chapters and had to put it down.
1,This is the 3rd time I am trying to finish this book. I love Italy and I love cooking so I am trying to get through it but It is so slow and I do not find it well written. It is not an amusing book. I am trying to finish it as it does have some interesting facts but I wish the author had a better style of writing - something that would captivate me rather than making me just feel compelled to finish the book so that I got my paperback moneys worth.
1,I couldn't get into any of the characters enough to finish this book.  It just didn't do it for me.
1,I have loved each and every book by Barbara Michaels and could not wait to get into this one.  I am very sad to say it was not at all up to the degree of writing I have come to love in Barbara Michaels books. It really was a difficult read.  It was slow and I struggled to continue reading it hoping it would get better.  It didn't get better.
1,i have loved every one of lora leighs breed books but this one left a bad taste in my mouth. i agree with the other reviewers about the repetition and how irritating cassa is. i am sooo ready for her to write about jonas.
1,The next time you see a a parade of unkempt "fill in the blanks" protestors marching against "something" they'll probably be waving this "Little Red Book". The original "Little Red Book" was of course written by Chariman Mao and was a 'de rigeur' fashion accessory for protestors of the sixties. That book was misquoted at length and widely misunderstood. Klein's book is sure to be the "Little Red Book" of the current generation of self-centred malcontents because of two qualities that it shares with Mao's - its size and its vague writing.	 At least Klein is forthright, albeit surreptitiously about the lack of analysis or direction of her overtly political treatise. Early on in the book she concedes that there are no 'concrete answers' to any of the problems she decries nor are there coherent strategies to deal with or resolve them. Klein instead takes the favoured route of most of the professional whiners of the New Left and instead devotes her book to to celebrating mindless protest and "civil action" while endlessly repeating meaningless panaceas like "social justice".	 In between bouts of self-congratulatory accounts of her activities with young "activists" Klein burdens the objective reader with her sweeping generalizations and superficial analysis of every topical issue from landmines to loans. Scattered hither and yon throughout her accounts of activities on the front line of activist protest are the usual justifications for the short-sighted and often violent activities of those she accompanies: "How can a movement be accountable when communities are fraying?" Klein asks, and thinking readers cringe. By example, Klein's acerbic discussion of the role of private security is laughable in the context of her breathless descriptions of the of mindless mischief and vandalism which her fellow travellers commit. Klein's book is full of such chicken and egg conundrums: The "activists" portrayed are often portrayed fighting situations of their own making. This of course begs the question "Which came first and why?"	  Quite in line with the thinking of those it champions Klein's book is pointless and reactionary - even against itself. Her bland recitation of the various sine qua non of activism; "globalization" "aparthied" etc. is given without context - either historical or political. The accounts of specific actions are unevitably laudatory and one-sided and show no concern for the outcome. Klein has written the perfect book for todays knee-jerk reactionary activist. Filled with comforting catch phrases and light on substance or consequence Naomi Klein's "Fences and Windows" is appropriately titled: The "Fences" are the misbegotten ideologies that keep her activist sheep marching forward to confrontation, the "windows" their distorted and ephemeral view of selected issues. There is no doubt that Klein is "preaching to the choir" with this book and anyone else is advised to avoid it at all costs.
1,This was written in a few days, if not a few hours. Or at least thats how it feels. Full of spelling and grammar mistakes, missing words, duplicates... The closing word thanks you for reading this book about 'Bill Gates' !... Copy pasted without much care for the reader.		The author inserted random wisdom and general tips for a better life (or however you want to call them) have nothing to do with the topic of the book, are annoying to read since its what you find all over the internet's self-help articles and such...		It reads as a summary of a collection of articles... Basically, read the wikipedia page and a few articles, look at a collection of buffet's famous quotes and save yourself the trouble.	The reviews that say so many good things are probably at least 50% fake ones!
1,I borrowed this book from the library expecting an insightful, educational account of witchcraft in America but was a bit let down. The author tries to convince the reader that she is having  some kind of existential dilemma and seeks a deeper spirutual relationship with something new and exciting so decides to check out various pagan circles to see if she can find her calling. Her writing is not terrible but she spends alot of time describing in lengthy detail the appearance, attire, living conditions and personal problems of the people she follows. It gives off a "holier than thou" vibe that is hard to shrug off. It makes you feel bad for the people that let her in their circles because they appear much more genuine than the author.		I cannot say the book was entirely awful and worthy of only a star because I did finish it and enjoyed the parts where she talked history. However, her own experiences seem embellished and lead you to believe that something exciting is about to happen but it doesn't. A good journalist? Sure. A bonafide convert to the teachings of Aleister Crowley or any other occult leader, which would surely cause backlash from her elite circle? Doubtful.		If you want to read a book that has exemplary writing and spoken from a witch herself, check out A Witch Amongst Us by Lois Bourne. Perfect read for anyone interested in first hand experiences with witchcraft and answers a lot of the burning questions that may not have been answered in Witches of America.
1,Beware. pages missing.
1,Things I've learned from reading just the first chapter of this book at the Pearls' Web site -- if you don't believe me, check it out for yourself by searching for "No Greater Joy":		* Place appealing objects within reach of toddlers, then "switch" (aka smack) their hands when they reach for them.		* If your nursing baby bites your breast, pull his hair.		* Newborns cry to be manipulative.		* Training children is just like training animals. (I have to wonder, then, why the Pearls advocate hitting children, when the vast majority of dog trainers don't advocate hitting dogs. I've never once laid a hand on my dog all through her training, and she is perfectly well-behaved.)		There may be a few positives about this book, but I would never in a million years support these authors by buying anything of theirs.
1,I don't get how naive Jewel was and how abusive and dumb Touch was. This book didn't do. The ending was stupid. Nothing happened. Jewel fell for the same bull twice and Touch idk. The book felt rushed through.
1,I'm always for giving a new author a try especially w/ a familar author doing the publishing. This was not a good read. Someone dropped the ball in this story. Do not buy. It could have went some where but the potential was lost trying to finish it, I think. I don't recommend.
1,I definitely agree with most reviewers: Isa Chandra Moskowitz is witty and engaging as a writer, but the recipes mostly don't do it for me. I thought there were too many American-style "we don't eat meat or dairy but we just love faux-meat and faux-dairy" recipes, as opposed to recipes that are equally vegan but are based on grains, legumes, and vegetables.		I don't regret having bought the book, but so far, my other vegetarian/vegan cookbooks are getting a lot more use, while this one is looking hip and post-punk on the bookshelf. I probably won't be racing to buy another book by this author.
1,Forever My Girl tells the story of high school sweethearts, Liam and Josie.  Although, they are deeply in love, Liam makes the decision to go out on his own and make his way in the music field leaving Josie and his friends and family behind with little explanation.  Ten years later, Liam is drawn back to his hometown to say goodbye to a good friend that has died.  Of course, he finds Josie again and something unexpected.  I am usually a sucker for second chance romance novels and thought Forever My Girl would be right up my alley.  Boy was I wrong.		My biggest obstacle to liking this story was actually Liam. When the reason for Liams departure is finally revealed it was lame (sorry to borrow my mothers 80s slang, but it fits).  But I was willing to overlook this because Liam is young and when we are young we do stupid things for silly reasons.  Strike two came for Liam during a flashback scene and we are shown how he broke up with Josie.  I have a few curse words I could use for Liam, but I want to keep it clean but honestly jerk just doesnt even begin to cover it (so use your imagination).  Strike three (and hes out) was not only did he leave Josie, but he just walked away from his friends as well.  That put him in D-bag territory in my eyes.  So my feelings toward Liam really slanted my view of the story.		I started out liking Josie.  She took a hard stance against Liam and wanted him to go away again out of her life.  She had moved forward in her life, found a loving fiance, and owned a business.  But she quickly slipped back into Liams life.  I felt a little too quickly.  I found the only likeable person in the mix was Nick.  He seemed a standup guy being there for Josie when Liam certainly wasn't and being a father figure for her son 6 years.  As the story progressed though, I felt Ms. McLaughlin wanted me to hate Nick.  Nick becomes angry and hostile to Liam and pushes Josie to set firmer boundaries with Liam.  Was that being unreasonable?  I didn't think so; Nick had to feel insecure with Liams return.  He knew how much Josie loved Liam at one time not to mention they shared a son as well.  Who wouldnt feel insecure or angry when they see the one they love pulling away?  Toward the end, Josie wasn't fair to Nick at all.  As soon as she began to feel the need to be with Liam again she should have been honest with Nick instead of hurting him more.		The lack of emotion really irritated me as well.  Where was the anger that Liam hadnt been told he had a son?  Liam didn't immediately pursue had had happened to Josies messages..it was almost like oh well I lost 10 years with my son.  No full on immediate reaction to unearth the truth.  Josie forgave Liam too easily.  For ten years her truth was Liam didn't care he had a son.  Even if that wasn't true, for ten years she believed that!  Wasnt she pissed off?  I couldn't feel Kaitlyns grief, Josies struggles as a single mom, or even Liams supposed remorse.  I couldn't even feel the great love that Liam and Josie hadif it was that great how he could he even have thought about walking away.		Overall, Forever My Girl was just not for me which is so disappointing.  Based on other reviews, my fellow readers obviously found no problem with the book with Liam.
1,Pity poor Count Dracula: His legend has been subject to Tom Cruise's mincing, Keanu Reeves' "acting," and now this ham-handed "DaVinci Code" wannabe. Kostova's first mistake is tap a bunch of graduate students as her heroes--as if your typical grad student weren't a spindly-armed, underemployed poindexter more suitable to be a minion of Dobby the House Elf. What, does the Dark Lord need help finding primary sources? The exciting event the kicks off the plot is--hold on to your britches--the discovery of a strange book on a grad student's desk! True, there are few gory murders, but the author splatters more ink on a even more heinous outrage: A card gets ripped out of a library's card catalogue! Oh, the humanity! Lots of pointless wanderings across Europe with the depth of a Lonely Planet guidebook and yawn-provoking pokings into libraries ensue. Worst of all is Kostova's writing style: The mechanical insertion of an adjective before every single noun. "A creepy wind came from the gray sky and swept over the gloomy town." It's like a metronome and reads as if generated from Bad Writing Software 2.0. Oh, the monotony!	Avoid this book, with garlic, a silver bullet and sharpened stake at your side if necessary.
1,This is a good primer on Information Architecture.  But I get the feeling  that these guys decided just to knock off after 150 pages.  That was easier  than contending with the knotty implications of all the conflicting  structural imperatives that IAs deal with day in and day out.	Given that  the authors work at nothing but Information Architecture, I sincerely hope  that they have a far greater depth of knowledge than this book conveys.	Mostly, the message that rings through this brochure is: "Principle  x is highly valuable sometimes, but it all depends on how it interacts with  principles y and z, and you'll just have to figure out what's the most  important as you go along."	Well, duh.  Those compromises between  design principles are the hard part of the job, and the authors don't  provide a solid practical or theoretical framework for working through the  compromise process.
1,I never got past the 2nd chapter.
1,This had a horrible ending. Like wtf!!! This is not a HEA. I did not see that coming. Why would the author do this???
1,Nobody's Fool is one of my all time favorite books. Thought this would be an opportunity to catch up with old friends, but that was a big mistake.  Gave up after 100 pages and hope that memory will fade so it won't spoil a book I like to go back to again and again...
1,I didn't like this book at all and I was hoping it will end soon. The story line was boring, and I didn't like the characters, not even the supposedly HOT guy (???), they were boring too! There wasn't anything interesting, just two people meeting, going out, making love, oh ...and some ropes to spicy things up.
1,Rape, incest, child abuse & bullying are just some of the serious and troubling issues that bombard the reader of Blue Rose. The author has no balance in the plot to provide the reader relief.  The entire story is pretty much filled with Alana's internal dialogue and horrific memories. Her self-loathing and self-destructive behavior make the story unbearable to read and the ending unbelievable.		I found Blue Rose utterly depressing. Since Alana's story is not essential to Jack & Lily's story in the Flowering series, I strongly advise to skip this book.
1,Read the first book and then first few chapters of the second , didn't like it that much. I got it since I had heard it compared to  the Twilight Series and I didn't feel it was on the same level.
1,Listened to this on tape. The book was very disjointed. Ms. Tyler was unable to develop most of the characters. There were inconsistencies and unfinished threads. This was my first attempt at an Anne Tyler book and I will probably not try another.
1,I liked the female character, Jenna.  I liked her toughness, her brilliant mind, her individuality, and going after what she needs or wants.  She helps Rylan with a computer virus in his company and is attracted to him. Rylan is yet another one of  those young billionaires.  We learn that Jenna suffered an horrific childhood, subjected to physical abuse and unimaginable sexual abuse.  Dylan reveals that he is a Dom and wants Jenna to be his sub.  Here is where the author appropriated liberally from Fifty Shades.  He shows her his playroom, check.  In it, all the "toys" are displayed, check.  He explains the Dom/Sub lifestyle, check.  Where the author lost me was when Jenna agrees to be his Sub.  SERIOUSLY?!?!  I cannot comprehend how someone who endured such depraved sexual abuse as a child, would EVER agree to such an arrangement.  It was so beyond the rhelm of logic, I just quit reading.  Save your money and do not waste your time with this book!!
1,Author McDonald does a decent job in giving the play by play of the summer that Maine native and Penobscot Indian Louis Sockalexis spent with the Cleveland franchise in the National League back near the turn of the 20th century.  Though too much time is spent describing the game details and not enough on the Native American experience and Sockalexis place in it, I can recommend this book to baseball fans and Mainers interested in finding out how (possibly) the Cleveland franchise in today's American League came to be known by its present day nickname.
1,Unbelievably bad.  I am willing to suspend belief up to a point, but this story was so beyond believable that I had to put it down.
1,I am not sure what nice thing to say about this book. I had expected it to be like your usual mnage a trois but this was just a hot mess.  Start off with a woman now married, whose ex now wants to have a mnage a trois with her and her husband. He offers then price they cannot refuse; money and job promotions. Before long other players get involve and the story goes off track.
1,I like witty chick lit as much as anyone. Sophie Kinsella does a fine job with this genre, and I like The Spellmans, as written by Lisa Lutz. Helen Fielding and her Bridget Jones series always earn a chuckle or snicker from me. I was hoping to discover another writer that compared, but was disappointed in this book. The main character, who supposedly LOVED her dog Cocoa, so much, had little concern about actually caring for the dog, but treating it more as a toy. I found myself constantly  being more concerned for the dog's well being than the heroine's. She was plenty self absorbed enough to make sure her needs were met. So, unlikeable and shallow heroine, neglected dog, and unconvincing mother daughter relationship did not add up to an enjoyable read for me.
1,Didn't think it was a terribly good book.  Bit boring and not terribly funny.  The ending was good but what a pity that it was really only the  last page.
1,Book is a piece of c rap.  One of Grisham's scams on his readers.  Grisham made a few bucks but further corrupted his image by publishing Playing for Pizza.
1,I really don't like to leave negative reviews but I was really disappointed in this story...it started off OK but after the assault on Cora, it just went downhill....and was so boring I kept thinking I just couldn't go any further....I did manage to finish but it took me over a week, and normally I'll finish a good book in a couple of days...this one I had no problem putting down...the characters are weak, not realistic at all, and the plot has many many holes...and there were so many loose ends left at the conclusion.  Sorry, I will delete this one & am glad I got it free...don't waste your time.
1,Not a must read, it you watch the show you don't need this book
1,Fun short stories staring some of our favorite characters. Very entertaining.		I didn't like the book. However, the characters were borderline from unlikable to a few exceptions the plot was a bit poor. The writing was poor at worst and bad at best. I developed some interest in the book but not enough to sustain me. If part of a series, at least one thing peeked my interest to continue. Even though the plot was uninteresting, not original or unique in any way and contained an overload of pretense, the romance was a little better but the romance was still flawed. The male/female lead was possibly abusive, verbal/physical or both, boring, or had no to very little chemistry with love interest, etc. Everything was too easily predictable. Overall, ok maybe some redeeming value!
1,No clear perspective (positive and negative) is given.
1,I had hopes for this story, billed as an historical mystery, set during The Great War and written only a decade later. Early in the book, there were a couple of moments where the setting captured me, especially the narrator's description of his feelings of vulnerability on learning that the war was to end in only a few hours. How was he to protect himself during that time? This was well done.		But then! The prose simply seemed to falter, become just pedestrian, workman-like, with no sense of energy or "joy" in the writing to pull me along. And the descriptions of the soldiers themselves began to seem more and more like caricatures rather than like people. I realize that this is a novel, but I still expect it to be populated by people. As for the mystery itself, it did not grab me enough to keep me interested and reading. There are simply too many other books waiting.		1.5*		A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review.
1,DNF @ 14% Therefore, I don't feel it is fair for me to give it any stars.	The world in this novel is unique,  but not enough to carry the story. This novel couldn't grab me, so I knew it wouldn't hold me.
1,I selected to read this book thinking it might be something my tween daughter could possibly read in the future but sadly, it's not. The book starts out on the wrong foot with Kiri smoking pot. I'm not nave...I know kids smoke pot but to start the book out with that put me off from the start.		Backstory:  Kiri feels like she has to be this "perfect" daughter who is a musical genius. Since her *screwup* sister Sukey died, she has been treated by her parents as "the good one". She was told her sister died in a tragic car accident and that's why her parents won't let her drive.		Kiri is an exceptional piano player. She spends countless hours practicing and also has a band with her best friend (and sometimes crush) Lukas. Kiri's parents are out of town on a 6 week cruise. Kiri gets a weird phone call from a guy named Doug saying he has her sisters stuff. Kiri goes against all she knows and goes to "the bad part of town" to find this guy. She ends up meeting Skunk when her bike's tire goes flat. He takes her to his place and fixes it (and you breathe a sigh of relief that he's not a bad guy).		The book focuses on Kiri trying to connect with Doug, Doug taking her to her sisters apartment, Kiri lashing out against the world, Kiri getting drunk and stoned and Kiri having sex. Kiri finds out she was lied to by her parents and has a near emotional breakdown. There are parts of the book that are understandable and I know there are kids out there who cope with drugs and booze but no where in this book is there a moral that it's wrong to do so. It's one thing to say kids are doing it but I felt it was almost promoting it. The base story is a good one but all in all, I'm glad it was a quick read because I was wanted to stop reading it right after I started.
1,Everyone has been accounted for but there is no meat to the story. The opening with Sal was off putting to me and in our current recognition of pedophilia by women. Given his protection coverage it stretches the imagination that his father is not aware of his activity. Selange for the first time got my applause by calling her son on his actions & activity.	This is the first time I did not immediately restart reading for the tidbits I might have missed.
1,This was one of my better free books. Simple romance and a fast, easy read. Might look for more from this author.
1,Spoiler alert if you prefer to not know what happens don't read this review. This started out with the most amazing concept. A blind girl who is a secret vigilante. A powerful female protagonist who has turnef what is percieved as a disability into a powerful ability. How disappointing when one chapter in the author abandons the complexities of this powerful plot restores her characters sight and turns her into another ordinary hormonal teen with super powers.bleah. there is so much of this out there and there are other writers doing much more believably. Preston you had something that would send a powerful message to a world full of prejudice and discrimination  and instead you joined the world "pack" who chuck the disabled in the too hard basket on a daily basis.
1,This wasn't horrible....but it definitely wasn't good, either. Skip it.
1,In his Thursday Next series, Jasper Fford introduced the term "bloopholes" - small details in a book that make the whole story at best improbable, at worst impossibe. There were so many of thos in the first few ahapters here that I was unable to sustain my suspension of disbelief.	One example is when two freedom fighters without question accepts a newcomer... it does not ring true that they would not have shown more suspicion... Another when a charachter flees on a mount, an arriving at her destination merely abandons it... Beasts of burden in a rural economy are expensive, valuable property - one ambling around on its own in harness would surely have been noticed... and the story would have been entirely different.	I must admit that I lost interest halfway through, and it is entirely possible that the book improves - it is also possible that I am nitpicking - but it is very important to me to be able to believe in the story, and I am sorry to say, I did not believe in this one.
1,I have been knitting for almost 30 years and picked up this book as a reference guide.  The illistrations are incomplete and unclear and don't match up with the written descriptions.  The section on casting on doesn't cover nearly enough of the cast-on options available or why to use different cast-ons in different situations.		There are many errors in the book as well.  The graphed or charted patterns do not always include all of the symbols you will be reading, so you don't know what the stitches are.  Also, the charts do not match her written instructions.  And some errors are just pathetic oversights.  The pattern for the cabled scarf is wrong.  The directions for the chevron pattern are wrong; the author even calls for a decrease when obviously you need to increase.  Her instructions for arrowhead lace have errors as well.		This book is poorly written and poorly edited; I normally love the "for Dummies" books, but I was severely disappointed in this one!  For a reference guide and a "how to" book, I recommend The Knitting Answer Book by Margaret Radcliff.  It's illistrations are excellent as are her descriptions of what to do, how to do it and when to do it as well as what the effects are.  As for patterns, I'll stick with Barbara G. Walker's Treasury of Knitting Patterns.  She has excellent instructions with no errors EVER.
1,Howie Carr has made a long career out of cultivating sources and writing stories that no one else dares to write. However that skill fails him here.  For one thing this book is nothing more than a bare bones rewrite of The Brothers Bulger.  He once again tells the story of Whitey Bulger and how terrible he was.  Along the way he takes pot shots at people and organizations he hates even if they only have a very tenuous connection to the story.		The worst part of it all is that he builds the story around a stone cold killer.  John Martorano was a truly evil person and Howie tries to make him out to be someone who while bad was OK because he stuck to the thieves code of honor.  Making excuses for this disgrace kills this story.  He is a background character for Howie to settle old scores but shame on him for even being included.  This book is not worth the money.
1,I didn't like this book. It took me forever to finish because I found it incredibly annoying.		The author is EXTREMELY biased. She tries to convince us of Judd's innocence from start to finish. I would rather read a book that allows me to make up my own mind, but she tries her best to not let you do that!		The author goes on and on about how Judd was a victim, (despite the fact that she confessed several times to the killing of her two girlfriends) because she acted in "self defense". Later, the author tries to theorize that maybe she didn't kill them at all.	The author portrays Judd as a sweet, little old lady and includes several photos of her in her later years, knitting etc. - which is misleading because Judd was 26 yrs old when she committed the crimes, not an elderly woman. There are only a few photos of her as a young woman, and no photos of the victims at all, because we are prompted to believe that the victim here is Judd.		The author frequently mentions that Judd was beautiful, petite and that her friends weren't as pretty as she was (significance?). She repeats several times that one friend in particular was quite a bit larger than Judd - and yet we're to believe that this tiny fragile woman was confronted by two larger women, (one armed with a gun, the other with an ironing board) and after having been tackled, shot, hit several times on the head with the ironing board, came to on the floor to find her two friends dead. Really? I found it much easier to believe the simple theory that she shot them as they slept.		I felt the author was far too enamoured with Judd to give an honest account of what really happened. She mentions her relationship with Judd throughout the book, (I hate it when authors continually insert themselves into their own book) and there are several photos of the two of them together, the author smiling with pride, which is weird, because she's posing with a killer, not a celebrity.		I finished the book feeling as though Judd was guilty of much more than she admitted to, and although the author says that 39 years was enough time for Judd, I don't agree. There doesn't even seem to be any remorse from Judd.		Anne LeRoi and Hedvig Samuelson were the real victims in this tragedy.
1,I just don't get what is supposed to be so great about this guy. I thought this book was boring, uninspired, unoriginal, and depressing. Maybe it's better in the original Norwegian (I read it in English).
1,I thought this might be a good book. I was disappointed for the most part. A few chapters were interesting, maybe even heart warming, if one could ignore the poor grammar, word usage and actual words crossed out during proof reading(?) but left in the copy.		Im quite sure I won't bother to read any more books by this author.
1,I know that anti Semitism abounds, in many places, perhaps even more in Dickens' era, but Dickens is a pedantic pompous writer who speaks out, sometimes at the expense of the story, about the suffering of the poor, and injustice, and yet here we have a book that unquestioningly has a character who we get to know virtually nothing of except that he is a Jew and evil.		This isn't just common garden anti Semitism that can be brushed off as a sign of the times. Two hundred years earlier, Shakespeare treats his Villian Shylock so much better and at least gives him a defence.		The word Jew is used here 328 times, almost exclusively to refer to Fagin: over and over again. He is introduced as: "A very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair" and from then on Dickens seems to revel in using the word Jew as often as he can.  The Jew did this and the Jew did that.  Jews are immediately recognised and referred to as such by characters in the book even when they are criminals with no religious attire that would identify them.		All this made me aware of what a great achievement the musical Oliver is. A Jewish writer, Lionel Bart, turned Fagin into a lovable rogue in the musical.  In the book Fagin is a murderer and the instigator of murder.  Bart takes an anti Semitic story and transforms it into what Oliver could have been if Dickens was not so obsessed with pointing his finger at evil Jews whose criminality can be just assumed.
1,This book was a great disappointment, especially given the critics' rave reviews. When I bought it, I was eagerly looking forward to sinking my teeth into it. Joan's story has always held a fascination for me; but while a number of the varied fictional accounts have done a good job of conveying the inspiration and excitement of that story, I have yet to find a nonfictional account of "the facts" that seemed reliable. Harrison's research was broad-ranging, and many of the details she includes are fascinating and will be new to most readers. And she is a good writer. However, there is much more "analysis" than history here, and it is deeply flawed, partly because Harrison is obsessed by a need to draw parallels between Joan and Jesus. Unfortunately, not only is her exposition of the Jesus story and its aftermath profoundly anti-Christian, but it also reveals a gross lack of knowledge of what the New Testament actually says. As bad as that is, it naturally raises a question as to the accuracy of her citations and interpretations of the literature pertaining to the Maid of Orleans. My wait continues.
1,'MAD About Trump: A Brilliant Look at Our Brainless President' by MAD Magazine falls pretty short of brilliant, but it has some laughs liberally sprinkled throughout (pun intended).		The gags stretch back quite a few years to Trump's Apprentice show, but for the most part are from the last couple years.  There are fake movie ads and comparisons between Trump and the preceding 43 U.S. Presidents.  There are famous hilarious things Trump has misspoken about other American heroes.		I read MAD years ago, and it was funny at the time.  This doesn't feel that funny.  Maybe because the subject already has the feeling of a parody.  Some of the humor feels like it just lays there.  There are gags that feel like they are from a late night tv show.  This isn't the MAD that I remember, but it is mildly funny.		I received a review copy of this ebook from DC Entertainment and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.  Thank you for allowing me to review this ebook.
1,I've left the Star Wars Universe at what turned out to be roughly halfway through the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Good story to that particular one, not important. That was back in 2007. I correctly called that TFA was going to be garbage as soon as I heard the rumors it was being made. I am one of those fans that TFA made *extremely* angry and as far as books are concerned, I will not go chronologically past the point I stopped at. Yes, I found out what happened to my favorite character and I'm still pissed about it.		Seeing this one in the library and seeing where it fit in the timeline seemed like a decent pick to read in the gym. The first 20 chapters were actually really good. It made me laugh in a lot of places and I am one of those people who can calculate eigenvalues in my head, so I could even appreciate the math jokes. My home gang thought the Fexian skullborers were plenty creepy and even some goofy pictures had been drawn. And I actually really liked Nakari: nice and obnoxious, just to my liking.		Then comes the kick in the teeth. I will say no more, but if you want to actually enjoy this, do not start chapter 21. After that, it's ruined.
1,I know very little about the Burma Road.  I know very little about General Stilwell, although I did meet his son Benjamin once.  I do, however, know a LOT about the Doolittle Raid.  I was excited to find this book at the used bookstore because it looked interesting and I'm always interested in learning more about WWII.  The first thing I did after getting the book home was to look up the Doolittle Raid in the index and read the short description in the book.		Imagine my surprise to find four errors in three paragraphs.  First, the raid was on April 18, 1942, not April 20.  Second and third, not all of the planes crashed in China (and none were shot down, as Mr. Webster claims).  One landed on a runway in Vladivostok.  Fourth, 13 Raiders, not nine, became POWs; eight were captured by the Japanese, and the five who landed in the USSR were taken prisoner there.  Three of the Japanese prisoners were executed and one died of dysentery and abuse.  The five captives in the USSR escaped about a year later.		The number of errors in these three paragraphs, especially about an event that is so easily researched, makes me seriously question the accuracy of the rest of Mr. Webster's research.  My dad has a copy of Barbara Tuchman's "Stilwell and the American Experience in China".  I think I'll skim Mr. Webster's book, which IS very easily readable, and borrow the Tuchman book for a real account.  Mr. Webster writes a good narrative; perhaps he should confine himself to relating his travel experiences.
1,I have read my share of dump endings but this one  takes the cake.  The book was ok about avg for series, a 3 star book until the end. Boy did it get unreadable quick.		Spoiler alert	Here it is - greatest hero of earth's entire existence (had defeated alien enemy all by his lonesome 50 yrs ago) decides he should sacrifice several billion people in decades long war so the people of earth will eventually agree to invade Swarm homeland SO -  he can fly there with an army to rescue his love/wife to be whom crashed there 50 years ago.  Yup - a basic god / superhero all this time devises a way to get billions of humans killed so he can get enough people together to rescue his love.  that's how it ends - Come On Man!
1,I'd love to read the book on my Kindle, but not at a price higher than the hardcover edition. Wake up, Penguin.
1,Another interesting premise ruined through poor execution. This writer is trying but it feels like she's just checking things off a list, you know, the master Twilight how to write a YA romance novel list, rather than truly expressing any talent. An 8th grader could have written this.
1,good story and some research....well acquainted with the Gardiner museum...one of my favorites.
1,Sorry. I'm not that excited about this book like the reviewers. I'll just say Hurwitz is trying to write like a Lee Child, and that worked for me while I wait for Lee Child's #22. Fight scenes are pure Child. Smoak seems very young, trained in many ways but lacking in something, social skills, maybe. A bit of raised by wolves. That is probably why I didn't like this book that much. If he was that darn clever as the book leads you to believe at first, why did he get into so many self made predicaments? I wish Smoak's weaknesses were brought out more in the book. Hurwitz tries with the back story, but fails. And that name, Smoak. If you're stuck in an airport like I was and you think the cover is awesome like I did, give it a shot. Give you something to do on the flight from LA to New York.
1,A Search Consultant myself, the book put forward some good idea's which it completely fails to work out. It is a book written for PR purposes rather than an attempt to give a genuine informed in-depth look of how, quoting the back-flap "the profession is charting the course of global business". Therefore it resembles nothing more than an parade of truisms.	An example is how McCool calculates the cost of a bad hire; I know the cost is high but the costs as claimed by the author are not substantiated, either backed up by any research or by detailed argumentation as why they are so high: the cost of a bad executive hire ranges from 10 to 15 times the annual salary of the executive (20% direct costs - 80% indirect costs). Why? How?  McCool never explains or argues how he gets to such figures - his assertion this represents the cost is enough.	The "because I say so" argumentation underlies all claims made in the book. All follow the path where idea's which do make sense are brought forward, but are not worked out nor illustrated in a manner that goes beyond the writing of what looks like a quickie performed by a PR ghost writer. Still, the majority of the chapters are not as meek as the one where he tells a story of how a headhunter can be a "hearthunter".	Sigh.
1,The illustrations are great and the concept is nice. I was left grossed out with the ants skimming across the kid's breakfast milk. At the end, the mother tells the kid where to find his smile. It would be better if he figured it out for himself. Most readers want the point-of-view character to solve his own problem. I was going to get several copies to give as Christmas gifts, but after reading it, there's no chance of that.  I'm sorry because it's obvious that the author put a lot of effort into this book and I commend him for that.
1,I downloaded this book for free because I was interested in seeing what it was about. I usually can find something constructive to say about a book no matter what. That being said, I would like to admit that I was only able to get through less than half of the book due to some statements I found to be incredulous. I am not from the streets and was not raised in the streets, but about nine years ago I began a relationship with someone reforming their life from having been involved in that particular lifestyle. I was exposed to his past experiences and him being considered an "OG" in the present. I have learned A LOT about gangs. If you are familiar with the streets there is a saying, "snitches get stitches" and that is if they are lucky. So to read that gang members readily gave up information had me shaking my head. The authenticity of gangs could be worked on a bit. To anyone distanced from real gang life, this book may be believable, but for anyone who is closer to it, some accounts are not. I really am sorry I could not give a better review, but I expected a lot more.
1,first, I HAVE NOT read the book- just the quick description about it on Amazon- I have never seen so many spelling mistakes, run-together words- did anyone else notice this? I can't imagine reading the book, seeing all the mistakes in the review!
1,Would like to know why this book was written and what the author was trying to say, I see no reason to read the book
1,I'm dumbfounded by all the positive reviews here, as it was all I could do to finish this book. The plot was farfetched, and Avery totally lost my sympathy as she became increasingly self-absorbed, to the point that her narcissism was almost comical. Especially tedious, however, were the steamy "love" scenes. Since the YA genre has to portray even necking as scandalous (and forget about petting), the overdone descriptions of basically just kissing became ludicrous and maddeningly retarded the plot. And I thought if I had to read one more time about the "hotness" of the Haldens or their hazel eyes, I would puke.
1,I was expecting a lot more because I loved the first two books so much. I think Wells should have quit while she was ahead.
1,Ken Kesey and the pranksters are a worthy subject, important in their own weird way to the American fabric.  Unfortunately, the book is written as if Wolfe feels it necessary to bombard us with self-indulgent would-be prose that comes off as self-admiring and detracts,from the actual story. Bottom line, the few firsthand accounts of the acid tests, directly quoted from participants, come off as far more authentic than any of the gibberish Wolfe generated by watching tape. Don't let the description fool you. He was no more part of the experience than mountain girl was part of corporate America. Wolfe has long been overly proud of his work. He fails on many levels here and the result is a tiresome journey into the mind of an innocent who has no experiential connection to the subject, which is probably why the stiffs love the thing.
1,I was really excited to get to read this book! I was able to get a copy through Netgalley and started it immediately because I heard really good things about it. Plus it's written from the perspective of the main character who's unable to feel any emotion. It started out great; I loved being introduced to all of the different Emotions and Elements. It added a cool feel to the tale that I hadn't really expected.		But somewhere near the middle of the book I began to enjoy it a lot less. Elizabeth would claim not to be able to feel anything still and then there would be scenes where it was kind of obvious that she felt something or else she wouldn't have even done anything. And then I'd think that that meant she was finally breaking through when a few pages later she wouldn't even notice any change and would continue to insist that she felt knowing. It was a little frustrating.		That being said, I spent most of the book being incredibly confused because it was all building up to the last section except with the way that it was written I didn't really enjoy that anticipation and felt no burdening mystery. Instead I was just impatient and felt as though this book was something that I just needed to get over with and I really hated that. I think maybe a different approach with this concept would have made me enjoy it all a little more but this book as it is just didn't do it for me. While I liked some of the supporting characters, I really felt nothing at all for Elizabeth and didn't have that emotional connection toward the story.		There were so many little characters that were introduced throughout that could have been used to clarify the purpose of all of these Emotions and Elements that were introduced at random and in a confusing manner but that opportunity was never really taken. I do think that maybe other people will enjoy this book better than I will but I'm glad that this is a stand alone novel.
1,Malva is a princess avoiding her fate while Orpheus is the son of a pirate trying to find his own fate. As their story progresses on the seas, they are caught in a mythical world with only a couple of companions. They must travel to the end of the world and face their greatest fears in order to return home. Along the way, they find adventure, romance and a few puzzles that need to be solved to get everyone home. Only thing is, not everyone returns home.		This was an adventure fantasy story. I liked being taken on a sea adventure and the concept of being stuck facing your fears was fun. The main characters were all nice to follow. I liked that you met the antagonist early on after Malva discovers the betrayal of who she thought was her closest advisor. Everything progressed well, until the very end of the book.		After such an adventure- I wanted a happy ending. While it was semi-happy, I was not completely happy with the ending. I like my main character to get all smiles by the end, but Malva did not. They go through so much on their journey, to have the end without the main characters together, is not how I like it.
1,I have read several other Doctorow books and enjoyed them but this is just a mess. I have no idea what he was thinking or why the sadistic love affair was included since it seemingly related to nothing else. What indeed was the purpose of the "mystery" of the cross. Other readers who have rated this a one star have said it better than I have but this is a complete waste of time and insult to readers of an otherwise brilliant author. This ranks as one of the worst books I have ever come across.
1,I liked the show so I thought I would try one of the books.  Sooooo tedious.  I didn't care about any of the characters.  The relationships were jejune.
1,Love Misty but this book is just silly....Got to give the girl an applause tho for marketing. Misty just keep dancing ....forget the books. I know you	Are also quite an inspiring speaker...just forget the books
1,I am less impressed by Mohandas Gandhi after reading this autobiography.  He appears to be something too narcissistic with trivial details. It does not justify the position that Gandhi deserves in our history.  I do not recommend it..
1,The writing wasn't bad, a little disjointed, but okay. The execution of the plot was awful though. These two people were so dysfunctional and codependent. Being treated like Indie was is not okay, what's worse is that she knows it, but they have such chemistry" that she can't say no...which shows her own issues and need for therapy (I'm not judging people that go to therapy by the way, I think it can really help). I love bad boy/good girl romances, but that's not what this was, this was a toxic relationship with a man that is completely and apologetically self-centered. He didn't feel bad about using people, especially Indie. He needed major therapy, not just rehab (I guess they do therapy there, but still). I'm just shocked and disheartened that so many people see the relationship in this book as a good one. I think maybe the author needed to show more of a change in the main characters. All we were given was that he went to rehab again and then went to find Indie. Perhaps if we had been given more than that, if we were shown his emotional growth, it would have seemed like a healthier relationship instead of the addict getting a new addiction/obsession... Just because that addiction happened to be Indie, doesn't make it okay. That's an obsessive and dependent relationship, not a healthy partnership. He was borderline stalking her at one point and he even knew it. What happens after their first real argument? I don't see them as talking it out, I see it as him yelling and throwing a temper tantrum and running to get high. since he was having an issue when his new addiction. He needed to go through more of a change to show he was capable of being in a healthy relationship and that they had more than what was going on in the bedroom. Spoiler* Not just going through rehab and see Indie with a baby and being okay with it. That doesn't show real growth.
1,I did not like it and did not finish it.
1,Why O' why do we keep reading these dragonlance stories from Wies and Hickman?  There is a reason those missing gaps, as they are called, are only mentioned upon in the novel and never gone over in detail.  That's because there isn't anything more to tell us.  To go back and try to micro manage a story to death doesn't leave anything to our imagination.  After a while it just becomes a paycheck for the people writing these stories and it loses it creative appeal.  Be content with the original Chronicles and Legends.  There really isn't anything more to the story.  Put your time into a different novel, something new.
1,It had some laughs, but disjointed, no depth, and not correct genre. Nothing really happened. We travel around and save the day, the end.
1,Average
1,I am sort of a moderate (yeah okay) but I lean toward the liberal side of the fence on social issues. But Ann seems to be out for blood in this book. I counldn't finish it because I found myself reading the rants of a person firmly convinced of her viewpoint. We use to have a term for people like this though I've given over calling Radical Leftist wackos and Radical Right wingers Fascists, I can say that Ann has at least taught me that there are people out there who are absolute in their views and vehemently so. This very intelligent woman (I'll grant her that) recently mentioned that Canadians ought to appreciate the fact that we haven't crushed them yet. I mean really! Attitudes like this have motivated people to commit massacres and lynchings through out history. I mean I am not saying Ann Coulter isn't an intelligent individual but she seems to lack tactful social skills that you're supposed to learn at the age of 10. She doesn't seem to speak or forward her political opinions in an intelligent manner. In the book she seems almost sophomoric about it all. And it's really sad because she's probably a good person, certainly a good American, but she seems well, Hitler-esqe in how she presents her views. What else is there to expect from a Fox News pundit but really?
1,You could play a drinking game with this book: every time he whines, take a drink!  Because there it is, on every other page, complaints - about his various body parts/ills, poor trail markings, crowded shelters, etc., etc. This gets old. I just finished Wild and this book does not compare.  Although the story is interesting and pretty well-written with good photos, there's too much whining and also criticism of other hikers. And spare us the toileting issues. (When I read Wild, I did wonder about that, but now am glad that Ms. Strayed left out those details!)
1,Frankly I wonder if this author has even read Dugin beyond copy and pasting clips from the internet.  Avoid.
1,This guy's stuff is the most oversold "language-learning" available.  Vague ideas that sound great but have zero useful support.  Since it's all flash-card-based, HEY, Wyner, here's a thought: How about a concrete plan of attack.  Not some vague ideas of the principles of learning, but a concrete step-1, step-2, step-3 map  with links to each step that actually work, instead of the non-effective vague garbage you present.  The lonely one star is only because you pose some interesting questions, although zero actual help.
1,God story
1,The author clearly states early on that the best approach to optimizing his book is to read it through, in the order written, preferably several times, right. This is not the way I use a technical support manual. So I am not qualified by his rule to completely evaluate the support this book might offer to the Nikon D7100 user.		My 'user' classification complicates the evaluation I offer. I was changing "horses", or systems, with the purchase of a Nikon DSLR. So I was frustrated to begin with. Frustration by stepping up from a 4/3 Olympus DSLR system, several actually over many years,can be managed with insight from good research on the new acquisition.		So I bought this book prior to purchase and studied it - not cover to cover, but overview oriented-to the conclusion that it needed the D7100 to complete its meaning. Once the package was in-hand I was immediately impressed with a.) the complexity of the D7100 b.) the quality of the included Nikon D7100 User Manual. It was easier to read, better organized, and more readily relatable to the camera than the Klosterman "experience".		So by my experience, which is one of multiple transitions (4/3 to APS-C, Olympus to Nikon, mirror-less to prism, contrast to phase, etc.) the extensive Nikon User Manual was more help on start-up than the book. This is a reversal of what I anticipated. The writer of the experience book rambles about very technical aspects in page long paragraphs that complicate understanding. As seen in the Nikon manual , this is a beautifully systematic DSLR system. You probably don't need the book to support the D7100.
1,I am Christian whose primary goal is to glorify God by raising spiritually mature children. I read this book, prayerfully considered it, did my research and thankfully moved on to other approaches. I have two kids who are great sleepers, great eaters, and are hopefully on their way to being spiritually mature.		Gary Ezzo has been discredited by well-resepected Christian leaders, pediatricians, and parents. (see link on [...] for several references including a particularly good one by the Christian Resource Institute)		Yes, this book does make valid points, but the tone and underlying message is "if you don't do things THIS way, you are sinning and your kids will turn out bad." And vice versa. Hey--No author, Christian or otherwise, can make these types of guarantees!! Every child is different, every parent is different. There are exceptions to every rule out there. Yes, God is the same and scripture is always the same, but as sinful people we cannot ever predict the future nor predict the exact results of our actions...let alone anyone else's.		Furthermore, many Babywise imperatives have zero (or out-of-context) Biblical backing. For example, Ezzo says that God would condone letting a child cry because, after all, even God the Father did not answer His son's cry on the cross. As the CRI states, "We see no way to make such an application of this verse without completely disregarding its original context and purpose." It is truly dangerous to provide out of context Scripture. After all, many Christians will read this book, note the Christian source, and not check references. Please don't be one of those!		If you do read this book, pray about it and please do some research on Ezzo. Just because an author quotes Scripture does not mean he/she is speaking God's truth.
1,Seller was real good,just don't care for the book. This book is strictly totem poles as shown on the cover. It does tell history.
1,For a Christian, this book is really sad. In the situation Ish finds himself.....he cannot turn to God to get him through the horror of being a lone survivor? Then to begin a family and not tell them of the past, not teach them to read and write??? Not tell them how to start over? Not tell them the history of man and God?  Not tell them about their Creator??  It's a very depressing book in that respect.  To just live a life of a scavenger instead of truly beginning again?  I think the first thing most survivor would do would be to fall on their knees and ask God for help. It depressed me and made me sad that anyone would live like that with no hope. I did finish the book only hoping that they would find their way to God and change the direction they were going.........sadly that was not the case.
1,Teaches a little vocab.  Not much more.  Fun book, best suited to introduce children of about 12 to accounting. Amazon requires 20 wods but I have nothing more to say.
1,not enough action and too much trivial bull in the book. Way to boring. the book goes on and on about nothing.
1,I just read Delusions of Gender (which was excellent!!) and thought this would be comparable...but the other one was infinitely better.  To be fair though, I've only managed to get through a third of this book.
1,I disagree w/ the one other review.  I have read a couple of other books by this author.  Two of them are Sweet Caroline and Love begins w/ Elle.  These books were good reads, and I grew to really like the main characters.  They were people that I might want to "hang out" with, and I was interested in them and cared about them.  However, I was just never really all that interested in Taylor and Will.  I like a relationship that you really believe the feelings between the couple.  I didn't really believe theirs, except that they kept saying it. Him to her and her in her head.  They played a couple of games of one on one basketball, they played some pickup football, they occassionally remembered how much they cared about each other once upon a time, they redid the computer system for his furniture store along w/ some other people I could've cared less about, her dad had a couple of health issues, she struggled w/ whether or not to move away to California for a job, there was a kiss every now and then, etc, etc, etc.  I know that was a major run on sentence, but maybe you get the picture. The book just didn't flow well to me.  This was 10 years after their relationship had fallen apart the first time.  This guy had clearly grown up, and she supposedly still had feelings for him, but the entire book was about the same thing over and over again, her not wanting to give him another chance!  I thought they never really even had a long meaningful conversation that seemed to last more than 5 minutes before it was abruptly over!  Also, there just seemed like to me to be a lot of extra, irrelevant characaters in the book.  I couldn't keep up w/ whose sibling was whose or whose sister-in-law was whose or whose neice/nephew was whose. They would be in a scene for a little while then gone, and they provided no real significance to the scene.  For instance a niece that was interested in some of Taylor's clothes at one point towards the end.  I thought, really, what was the purpose of that???  Just didn't make sense to me.  I found that the last one-third of the book, I was just skimming the pages trying to get finished so that I could move on to a better book!  It was just okay for me, but to each his/her own!  I was mad @ myself for spending $10 downloading it!
1,This book is horrible for someone attempting to learn programming for the first time, it too technical and not practical.  I had to take the course twice and it still did not sink in.  To math oriented and too much technical detail causing the average person to just want to quit.  I first took the class on line no instructor and it was terrible.  I then took it over with an instructor and he was no better he did not like the over emphasis on math problems and technical jargon so that did no good in teaching me the basics needed.  I got the step by step book and I'm seeking another so that I can teach myself.  I really want to learn this program
1,I have to put this into the same category as Fifty Shades...boring, poorly written, unbelievable premise.  Sorry to be a spoil sport, but it drags.
1,At the beginning of World War II the author was an 18-year old enlisted aviation ordnanceman who subsequently served on several carriers in the Pacific.  Readers would hope that he would leverage this experience to provide a unique and original viewpoint of war on a carrier.  Unfortunately, Kernan strays far outside his expertise.  Many of his comments and some of his facts are dead wrong; some of his comments and many of his interpretations can seem to be creditable on a superficial level, but are also either dead wrong or one of the breed of insidious half-truths that have a life of their own and are hard to squash.  This book will be cited in future works, so another cottage industry has been created to correct the horde of myths and inaccuracies that will trickle down into Naval history from this book.  To crown this achievement, Kernan creates a new "conspiracy theory" about the Battle of Midway.		 Any good conspiracy theorist needs to first establish his personal credibility.  This Kernan attempts in a few introductory chapters where he talks about military history, carrier aviation, ship design, and aerial torpedoes.  His believability dies quickly. Specifically, I count 20 substantive or interpretive errors or half-truths in the book's first 25 pages.		 There are errors where his facts are just dead wrong:		*  "The USS Oglala was hit by four torpedoes ..."  No, she was not hit by any torpedoes - she sustained underwater damage from a single torpedo hit on a light cruiser that was moored inboard of her.  Because she sank without taking any direct hits herself she was later known as The Ship that Was Frightened to Death;		*  The Japanese had not "stalemated the Russians in Manchuria," actually the Japanese were soundly beaten at Nomonhan, the 23rd Division being nearly annihilated with 76% casualties.  The only reason the Soviets halted was because they had Poland to invade and then the Germans to repulse;		*  The US Navy had radar "courtesy of the British."  No the first USN radar was on a ship in April of 1937, and the first production radar, the CXAM, began installation in May of 1940.  Exchange of radar information with the British did not happen until the Fall of 1940;		*  Carriers to launch wanted 30 knots of wind over the deck, not "30 knots [of ship's speed] plus the wind."		... and many other factual errors.		 There are errors where his proffered opinions are either only half right or misleading.  For example, his comments on the placement of islands on carriers, boiler and engine room subdivision, and stack numbers and placement are superficial and uninformed, and generally half-truths.  Tonnage limitations and how the disposal of stack gasses effect turbulence in the landing area is never mentioned.  He thinks that early US carrier designs had arresting gear at both ends of the ship because "depending on the wind, the carriers were as likely to launch and land planes while going backward as forward" - no, Alvin, the arresting gear at both ends was for emergency recoveries without having to break the deck spot, or in the event of battle damage.		Even more egregiously, he does not understand the distinction between belt armor and a ships torpedo protection system, mixing them up in his discussion and then laughably coming to the conclusion that carriers succumbed to enemy torpedoes "because they were not armored enough."  He uses technical terms improperly: for example, a ship's propeller shafts are referred to as "drive shafts," equating a carrier's propulsion system with that of a 1941 Chevrolet roadster.		 After thus establishing his credibility, Kernan then goes on to collect some of the reasons why so many of the US torpedo bombers were lost at Midway.  Most are straightforward, collected from other secondary sources dealing with the battle, and are presented in a workmanlike manner.  However, when he moves to original material he reveals his true roots, not those of a Navy aviation ordnanceman, but of an English Professor from an Ivy League school.  What he really wants is to talk about racism and class barriers in the wartime Navy.  Racism he could work in only for a sentence, since it is clearly irrelevant to the story.  Classism, however, becomes the centerpiece of the only "original" analysis in the book.  Kernan contends that there was a conspiracy among the Navy high command to confuse or suppress the facts surrounding the attack of Torpedo 8 in order to protect the career of the Commander Hornet Air Group (CHAG), Commander Ring.		 The bare facts are the following:  the enemy carriers were located inexactly.  Ring and Waldron have an argument before launch on the flyout course to use to find the enemy, but Ring is unconvinced by Waldron's arguments.  Ring, as CHAG, gathers his squadrons and heads out.  30 minutes after launch Waldron again argues over the radio with the CHAG, then, on his own hook, departs from the formation with his squadron of torpedo bombers.  Waldron finds the carrier, attacks, and his entire squadron is shot down, inflicting no damage.  Ring does not find the target and returns to the Hornet.		 Waldron is Alvin Kernan's hero.  He dedicates the book to him.		 In Kernan's view, Waldron is the self-sacrificing hero and Ring is the goat for not agreeing with him, and subsequently for not finding the targets when presented with the "correct" course by Waldron.  This is exactly 180 degrees out, and where Kernan displays a lamentable ignorance of how military organizations work.  Waldron was obligated to present his views to his commander; however, he was equally obligated to follow the orders of his commander afterwards.  Kernan spends a lot of ink explaining why the Devastator was a poor aircraft and inadequate to the task; how, then, can he make Waldron out as a hero for disobeying orders and leading his squadron on a suicide attack in such an inadequate aircraft?  If the TBD was unlikely to penetrate to the target without fighter support and the diversion of a dive bombing attack, points all well made by Kernan, how can Kernan subsequently praise him for doing just that?		Waldron was guilty of disobeying orders, and should have been court-martialed; the real "conspiracy" was that the Navy gave him a Navy Cross for getting himself and his people killed.		 Examine what could have been: if Waldron had followed his commander's orders, he would have arrived at the point of no return and turned back, undoubtedly with a great big "I told you so" expression on his face.  But then, his torpedo squadron would have been back on the Hornet and available for subsequent strikes, including those against Hiryu and against the Japanese cruisers on the 6th, after the Zeros were gone and the TBD had a reasonable chance of getting hits.  Had he acted appropriately, his combat power would have been preserved for later, instead of senselessly thrown away.  These points totally evade Kernan as he obsesses with his conspiracy theory.		 The evidence that Kernan presents to support his idea that there was a Naval Academy Alumni Association conspiracy to "save" Ring career is that Ring did not submit an after action report (rather, that Kernan could not find an after action report in the archives, quite a different thing), and that Mitscher's after action report was inaccurate as it supposed that Ring passed to the south of the target carriers, when he evidently actually passed to the north.  Kernan does not understand that the after action reports, submitted only days after a battle, sometimes reflect the very real confusion of the battle.  Considering that Torpedo 8 and Fighting 8 were lost in toto, Mitscher was writing a report based on limited inputs and not a full picture.  Often only an exhaustive after-action review is able to get the facts sorted out.  From this slim reed - the lack of a report, and an inaccurate report - Kernan claims a conspiracy to protect Ring.  That's the jist of Kernan's argument.  There is no other evidence, no corroborating testimony, no other facts, just Kernan's perception of class jealousy manifested into a conviction of a conspiracy.		 One wonders if Kernan's research in the field of English is held to the same standard of evidence.		 One should buy this book if one would like to see a collection of secondary source information regarding the US torpedo bombers at Midway.  He has some quotations from works that are not easily located, and collects faithfully most of the arguments against US torpedoes and the Devastator torpedo bomber that are located in disparate sources.  One should not buy the book for clear charts or graphics - "minimalist" is the style, so minimalist as to be nearly incomprehensible.  One should also purchase this book if one wants to be entertained when the real naval historians go into damage control mode to stamp out all the disinformation spread by this book.		 One should not buy this book if you are less than an expert in the field, for you are likely to be misled by what is known in the Navy as "bum gouge."		Dr. Alan D. Zimm, CDR USN (ret) (By the way, NOT a USNA grad).
1,The story is good and so are the illustrations. But detailed drawing is not compatible with Kindle. Pages load slowly. Details are difficult to see. I suggest purchasing the print version. Dont buy animation for Kindle.
1,IN THIS ERA OF GLOBALIZATION WHERE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RULES THE WORLD. DOES AMERICA GET THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST MINDS. YES, THROUGH LEGAL IMMIGRATION IT DOES AND IS TREMENDOUSLY BENEFEITED.ARE THERE MASSIVE PROBLEMS DUE TO ILLIGAL IMMIGRATION. YES, AND IT NEEDS TO BE CHECKED. DOES THIS MEAN ALL IMMIGRATION SHOULD BE STOPPED? AMERICAN COLLEGES,COMPANIES,SOCIETY AND IN THE END THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SUFFER DUE TO MEDIOCRE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST. EINSTEIN WAS AN IMMIGRANT 60 YEARS BACK. SO WAS THE FOUNDER OF HOTMAIL FROM INDIA. SHOULD PEOPLE LIKE THAT SHOULD BE RESTRICED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE NON-WHITE AND NON CHRISTIAN? WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE BELOW AVERAGE ENGINEERS,DOCTORS,MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AS LONG THEY ARE NATIVE-BORN AND WHITE? WHAT HAPPENED TO A  JOB GOING TO THE BEST PEOPLE INSTEAD OF POLITICAL APPEASING TO THE NATIVE ELEMENTS. THIS EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED 100 YEARS BACKS WITH A STRONG BACKLASH AGAINST THE IRISH AND ITALIANS. WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART POOR AND UNEDUCATED AND COMPETING WITH THE NATIVES. THEY WERE ALSO DEMONIZED AND DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.WE ALL CAN FORM ALL OWN CONCLUSIONS AND CONFRONT THE INNATE XENOPHOBIA,BIGOTORY AND UNDERLYING BIAS IN A POST 9-11 WORLD REGARDING THESE MATTERS OR CANNOT WE?
1,The Heroin is full of bitterness it ruined the story. She brings so much negative emotions it sucks the reader's energy. She's so bitter, always arguing and fighting and complaining it's a very annoying book. Sorry.
1,it comes to no surprise that these anti-religious loons are trying to convert as many people to atheism and humanism when events like 9/11 were sparked by religious fundamentalism. It is fundamentalism that is the problem, not religion itself. However, these people who have limited understanding of God seek to do damage which is not supposed to be the role of individuals but rather a collective of people who seek to prove that they are right and everyone else who is not like them is wrong. These secular fundamentalists are no different nor any better than their religious counterpart, I find it interesting how much they have in common yet they hate each other.		This war on religion should be more so focused upon the war against fundamentalism, not religion, nor God. These inspired texts have caused much conflict, no one can deny it, but they have also cause people to reach potentials never before reached. Could it be that fundamentalism is the problem being that fundamentalism is what has caused religion to be used for war and personal gain? These critics of religion should be willing to help their religious heretical counterparts in breaking down dogmatic fundamentalism. Instead they dont, they attack all of religiosity as if it was the full problem. These books and others like them are based on ignorance.
1,My mother read the book after I purchased it and really did not like it. As a result I decided to cut my losses and not read the book .
1,I started reading the Jack Reacher novels three months ago, and this is the sixth one I've read. The novels make for compulsive, page-turning reading. But the author also has a very good eye, a deft turn of phrase, and an interest in recounting facts which have left me with the impression that I'm reading something better than trash.		Most reviewers seem to prefer the early novels in the series, but this is my least favorite so far. The story started well, but quickly became implausible. And, in contrast to the later novels, Mr Childs doesn't seem to bother with factual research, and just makes things up, regardless of whether they're right: this undermined the novel a bit for me.		It's still a pretty good read, and I'm enjoying it, but I enjoyed all of the others a lot more.
1,So I like the book, however I only gave it 2 stars because something bothers me, and I think about it every time now, when Edward says if he smelled fresh blood, like if she was crushed by the van or during blood typing,  he wouldn't be able to control  himself,  so what happens when she has her period? I mean it should have shown up during the 1 month time frame where he wasn't talking to her. He sits right next to her in biology he would have smelled it. Soooo there you have it. That's bugs me because it is a pretty glaring error.
1,Of the advertised 501 tips there were three that were good. Most were general, not specific to Disney. Then I read other Orlando guides and found two of the three good tips. Not a good investment of time or $.
1,The book is evidently written to impress the author's academic peers.  It is not lucidly written for the average intelligent person.  The author mentions all (most?} of the political sciences ideas on the matter just to cover all the bases, however the discussions of them are not lucid at all, and quite tedious to plow through.  One thing that impressed me is the lack of any in depth statistical knowledge which might support the various positions and ideas.  Only simple surveys are given as evidence.		I must say that some of the academic ideas are interesting.  It might be worth skimming the book to find out what these ideas are.		However, after all the dust has settled, the author claims limited, more simple government would be better, since it would be easier for the average voter to understand and therefore make a sensible vote.  This seems quite plausible to me.
1,Faulty!
1,This is a shameless book. The title sets up a premise which the opening pages immediately and without any trace of guilt debunk: that during WWII in Princeton there was a weekly series of discussions at Einstein's house among Einstein, Pauli, Godel, and Russell which featured deep insights into the very foundations of physics and math by four of the giants of the 20th century.		Sorry! What we meant to say was the meetings probably never happened, and even if they had, what was said at these meetings is a matter of complete speculation because no accounts survive.		So now that we've shot down the premise, what should we write about? Let's make it a series of sketchy minibiographies along with some  vague, wordy, superficial descriptions of their contributions to science and math.		Unfortunately, at some point the original author dies! We shouldn't blame him for this, as it presumably wasn't his fault. Now what? The manuscript is too short for a book-length project. I know, let's hire someone else to write a Part Four about Oppenheimer, Heisenberg, and the race to build the atom bomb. Never mind that this has very little connection with the previous three sections, other than being about physics in the 20th century. Just tack in on to the end and voila! A book! Now send it to the printer and keep our fingers crossed that it will sell enough copies to make a decent profit.		Oy! Is this any way to write a book?
1,stupid
1,Didn't finish.
1,I have to admit that I liked the writing style on this, at least a paragraph or page at a time.  But, it never seemed to get off the ground.  The engaging prose was not quite engaging enough in the absence of clear, well-paced story for me.  But, I could see how someone would like it just for those great paragraphs.
1,Misleading title and horrible information which you can learn from watching a YouTube video. Please save your money and instead invest in Fastlane Millionaire by MJ Demarco which is actually worthy of your money.
1,The first book in the series was a five-star rating. Should have stopped there. I purchased the next three should have been condensed into one.
1,This is a biography of Cary Grant, born Archibald Leach, and having loved watching him in Hitchcock films, I decided to read this book. The book goes into some detail about his early life before coming to America, which is somewhat interesting. Then, the rest of the book is about the films he was in, who he co-starred with, what the films were about, and how the public reacted to those films. It's really more of a book about Cary Grant's role in Hollywood, rather than an actual biography. A biography would include more about the actor's personal life and relationships with others, which this does not. I read half the book then had to put it away. Sadly, it was a very boring book and I would not recommend it.
1,The Girl from the Woods is a book I expected to really enjoy. The synopsis grabbed me and the reviews were great. Unfortunately, Im part of the minority, as I did not enjoy this one.		Dont get me wrong I didn't hate this book. There were some good moments to be found. However, the book was not at all what I had been hoping for. I wanted to be pulled into the story from the very beginning, yet I wasnt. I wanted a romance I would adore, yet I never really cared much for the romance. I wanted a paranormal read that would leave me with all kind of crazy emotions, yet the paranormal element seemed to take a backseat. All in all, I wanted more from this one.		I think a large part of my issue with the story is that I expected more depth from this one. Its a very quick read, but even for a quick read, there isn't quite the depth I would have liked. Things hit you one after the other  they just are, without much by way of explanation. I found myself questioning too much, I found myself unable to buy into a number of aspects of the story, which in turn prevented me from enjoying the way things came together.		It had potential, but for me it didn't quite deliver.
1,This book was okay... I too would say borrow it or check it out from the library.  It had some useful information, but what it did have was not indepth enough to really be of help, and most of it was irrelevant.
1,If you want your child to learn to set his or her own limits, to feel safe at home, or to develop a variety of ways to deal with the natural adversity that the world can deliver, then this is NOT the book for you. This book will teach a child to fear his parents and to use force as a first means to solve problems. A child brought up this way in the modern civilized world is likely to end up in jail. But then, so will his parents, since the training recommended here will bring Child Protective Services into the picture once the methods of discipline being used are discovered.		Firm and consistent discipline is very effective, and doesn't require the use of a switch or any other means of corporal punishment.
1,Note:  I received a copy of this book in return for my honest opinion and review.		This first children's book by the author was originally published in India and the publisher lists it for young readers in grades 4--6.  After reading the book I don't know why the book had to be so long---370 pages and this length did not materially add to the plot or interest in the book.  The majority of reviews had been five stars and very positive and I wanted to make sure I was giving the book a fair chance.  Perhaps the difficulty for me is that the book must have been written with children from India in mind and the cultures are very different between India and the U.S.  The author evidently wants this to be the first novel in a series using her main characters----dogs, cats, a squirrel, bees, crows and for the book to become a children's literature classic.  I am at a total loss as to the statement that the book presents multiculturalism to the child reader and somehow the marriage between two different species (a dog and a cat) was considered significant and that the author's degree in psychology really helped her in writing the book---after reading the entire book, I don't agree with any of these statements.  The author needs to develop the characters more---a description of the characters to make them come alive for the reader would have helped.  What was the author's intent in writing this book?  What was her purpose in writing this particular book and what did she believe would result from the child reading it?  What size are the characters?  Are the bees the same size as the squirrel?  the same size or larger than the dogs and cats?  The squirrel is half the size of the crow and the crow completely wraps the squirrel within its wings to protect him?  There were once big cats and dogs---what size are the dogs and cats in the story?  There are 14 pencil drawings in the book but they do not help the reader determine size and appearance of the characters in relation to one another and the text does not clarify the situation for the reader.  It would have been helpful for the illustrations to show all of the main characters in relation to each other.  What are the actual relationships among the characters?  The squirrel and his friends really didn't seem to have adventures, or rather, the adventures didn't seem to advance the plot of the book which resulted in the story line not hanging together.  It would have been interesting to have riddles for the child reader to solve as the story progressed.  The actual puzzle at the end was too complex, too involved and too long for the age child the author is writing for and injecting child humor would have made the book more enjoyable without detracting from an "action" or "adventure" book.  If a writer is going to use animals as the main characters, they should have some genuine characteristics of the actual animal and then the dialog could give the character a voice in keeping with what the animal would think and say.  A great deal of the things in the book are given peculiar made-up nonsense names---it would have been helpful if the author had more consistency in the names of things the characters encountered.  I have no problem with fantasy or magical plots (I love Tolkien and his Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit) but this book just didn't hang together and merely suspending disbelief didn't help.  My 10 year-old grandson is an avid reader, loves books and the Harry Potter series is a favorite of his--I don't think he would find this book engaging and if I had been looking for a gift for a grandchild  instead of reviewing it for posting on amazon.com I would not have read but a fraction of the book before putting it down and deciding to try another book.  It was evident at the end of the book that the writer wants there to be additional books in the series---but for a series to be successful, the readers have to want to know what is going to happen to the characters next or in the future---as this book is written, I don't think that this goal has been achieved although several other reviewers stated that they loved the book and couldn't wait to read more about the little squirrel.  I would suggest that the writer come up with characters and situations that would make a good series with plots and story lines that hang together--and she needs to spend more time in planning the plots for each book.  I don't know why the editor assigned to this book from the publisher didn't help the writer develop the story line and characters better.  Letting children of the target age and culture read a chapter of the manuscript or hear the story line could provide valuable feedback to the writer and, in my opinion, would help her immensely.  I am not trying to discourage the new author, but hope that my comments can help improve her writing and lead to a successful writing career.
1,This is the worst Dean Koontz book I have ever read. Just horrible, which is surprising because I usually enjoy his books. NOT recommended.
1,This author goes on and on about "the end of nature" but he doesn't do much about it,  or know much about it scientifically except to go on and on about the precious personal experiences that he buys with his inherited wealth.  Nice to have a highrise pad in Manhattan to retire to after roughing it heroically in Vermont, Uganda, etc.  Peter Matthiessen inherited wealth too, but he did something with it, stood up for wildlife conservation and Native American rights.  This author is much more interested in bragging about his exploits and showing off his literary circus tricks than he is in the fate of nature and humanity.  It is the kind of eco-pornography that gives environmentalism a bad name.
1,I had a difficult time finishing this book. None of the characters seemed worth caring about and I got irritated by the constant reminders about how highly trained these secret operatives were. The werewolf aspect had virtually no impact on the story. It seemed a tacked-on idea to fit with the trend of shape-shifters with no impact on any story results. Everyone seemed entirely too blase' about most of the bad things that happened, and the villain's tactics and motivation appeared half-hearted at best. The first assassin gets killed? Send in another one--alone. He gets killed? Send in another one--alone. The good guys casually kill the assassins, someone conveniently available or coming to the rescue to do the deed. Then they worry about who sent them and why, but tension ends there. I almost quit reading halfway through, but slogged along and was rewarded by a marginally more interesting conclusion.
1,After reading the reviews, I was glad to try this book.  The author gives too many details, and the pace of the book slows down as a result.  I gave up at 26%.
1,I am an avid reader and have been for over 40 years; I also love books and reading so much that I can find something good to say about even the junk mail I read. I give you that information so there can be little doubt how strongly I feel when I say I found nothing redeeming about this book. Let me explain.		First, the narrator is the most self-centered, overly-dramatic character/narrator I have ever encountered. She was dumped by a cheating boyfriend. Boyfriend, not husband of even a short time. If I remember correctly (I'm hoping to eventually forget I even read this book), they dated less than a year before she found out he was cheating on her. Her reaction is so over the top, so extreme that I lost any shred of sympathy I had for her at the outset. She chronicles her behavior after the relationship ends -- stalking and threatening the ex, being cruel and vicious to her loved ones and friends, shirking work, lying, etc -- that is so bizarre for the circumstances that I felt she needed psychological help, not a religious odyssey. Sadly, this self-centered, spoiled brat behavior can't be blamed on just the break-up; the author shares scenes from when she was a teen, etc., in which she, for example, screams at her mother and demands the newest, very expensive phone for her birthday, even though she realizes even at the time that her parents have no money for such a gift. This line was very telling: "'I don't care. You're getting it for me.' I give her a **threatening look** (emphasis mine) before I walk out of the room. She did not have any money. But she managed to buy it for me." Wow! Even while on her trip, just after supposedly coming face to face with what she has become, she is hyper-critical of others, judging and ridiculing them in her thoughts. Yes, she has occasional moments of remorse and compassion, but they are so fleeting that they only serve to highlight what a selfish, vain, self-centered woman she is as well as how little impact her journey really makes.		Secondly, the pace of this story is mind-numbingly slow and much information is unnecessarily repeated (and repeated and repeated). I could only read for short periods and had to force myself to go back and continue.		I was also taken back by the very obvious efforts to sanitize Muslim beliefs and history. The author's appalling lack of knowledge of her own belief system, coupled with her very childish acceptance of questionable (to put it mildly) information about her own belief system from sources with no apparent credibility significantly (negatively) impacted her own credibility on the topic.		The author's writing style is annoying at best. Almost every character used the expression "Ermmm", for example, and there are other stylistic issues.		There's so much wrong with this book that I am amazed it was even published. Please save your money and your precious time -- pass this one by.
1,not worth the price
1,A Load of Hogwash,	  I think Mr. Wagner should write a book about what really happened in his and Natalie Wood's lives before he also passes away.  The truth won't hurt his career anymore and then he and Christopher Walken can leave this earth with clear consciences.  He should be grateful that he is who he is, in every way, or otherwise he would have been writing his book from a prison cell.
1,Let me nail my colours to the mast here and say immediately that I did not merely dislike this book -I utterly hated it. The praise with which the book was garlanded in England seems to me to arise from the fact that its author is from out of the usual literary loop-not a University educated litterateur but a bus driver-and that it treats of a group still not widely represented in mainstream literary fiction  namely the white blue collar crowd. It does so in a manner that seems to me patronising and dismissive;please note I write as one who worked construction ,road repair and other assorted tasks,including,as with the characters in this novel,fence laying. The characterisation of such people struck me as grossly offensive and had minority racial and/or sexual groups been so depicted there would have been an uproar-and rightly so.	Leaving aside such considerations, the crassness and obviousness of the symbolism is itself good enough reason to snort with derision at the  contents of this book.	Basic premise ; Tam and Ritchie,fence layers and gross caricatures of blue collar life(beer,cigarettes,blue denim)work for a small Scottish firm and are despatched with their English foreman to work in England. The change is from a family concern to one run on scientific principles of manangement with the resultant debasement of the work force. They are shown gradually losing their humanity and individualism being compelled to wear uniform and eventually being virtually incarcerated in a work camp after the daily grind. En route they accidently kill a client -Mr Mills seems to regard the deadpan description of such events as inherently hilarious.	Let me demur from this position please.	I do not disagree with the underlying theme that work debases more people than it elevates but many people have said this more crisply -Studs Terkel for one -but the heavy handed allegory and crude symbolism just struck me as jejeune and obvious and I simply object to the crude depiction of people who are at the bottom of the economic pecking order.	The characters are not individuals but symbols and might just as well have the word "victim "stamped on their foreheads. The Booker Prize nomination it gathered shows the naive and patronising nature of the literary establishment	The book does a grave diservice to people working hard in menial jobs for little reward	I am able to tolerate incompetence and slipshod writing  if the book wears its heart in the right place or entertains , but not the contempt shown for its subjects in this tawdry and puny spirited tale
1,I was given this book in exchange for my honest review and Subsequently it became free so I went ahead and purchased it.  But I tried to read this and I could not get into it it was a major disappointment too.
1,I began this novel with high expectations. It was on the best-seller list and I had heard lots of buzz about it being the new Southern gothic. The beginning was intriguing- a little boy is found hung and no one knows who did it or why. Now, when a book begins with an unsolved murder, call me crazy but I expect that that murder will be solved by the book's end.		While the murder is never solved, the story is actually a cat and mouse game between the murdered child's sister, Harriet, and the alleged killer. Never mind the fact that a child is not a match for a grown man. The rest of the book can be summed up in a few words: drugs, racism, and snakes. The murder is never solved. The reader never finds out what happened or why.		After the end of the book, I thought that perhaps someone had torn some pages out of the book because there was no real conclusion; it just ended.		I can count the number of times I've finished reading a book and felt my time had been wasted on one hand. This, unfortunately, was one of those times.
1,I have been thoroughly disappointed with everything that Gore Vidal has published since "The Golden Age" (and that was not him at his best). I have enjoyed his novels, chiefly "Julian," "Creation," "Burr," "Lincoln," "1876," and even "Empire" and Hollywood." I still recommend these books because of their wit, their invention, and their iconoclasm.  I would also recommend his large collection of essays.	However, when it comes to this book praise is difficult. First of all, although it does cover much the same ground as "Burr," but a great deal of this work is spent dispensing gossip half truths and obscure quotations which really do not seem to amount to much other than iconoclasm for iconoclasm's sake.  It seems that the only people who come off reasonably well in this book are Adams and Franklin (which is odd since they represented different views on life and future of America).	The other "founding fathers" are disparaged through and through. While I believe there is a place for these sorts of evaluations, I do believe that Vidal goes too far at times. The characterization of Hamilton as a "British agent" which he expresses in a somewhat peculiar fashion really is too much. Personally I dislike Hamilton, believing him to have been a positive menace after he left government service at the age of 40.  However, I do not know of a reputatable historian who would support this claim by Vidal.	The reason that Franklin comes off so well is that Vidal has found a rather picquant and pessimistic quotation from "the sage of Philadelphia" expressing fear of the degeneration of the  American republic.  This obscure quotation is raked over throughout the book. For this service Franklin is praised, though I am not sure he would welcome it.	One gets the impression that there is a part of Gore Vidal who seems to believe that the US invented political corruption and this has been with us from the beginning. While the second part is true, this is a phenomenon which the US can not claim exclusive ownership.  I think the failings that he delights in are failings that exist in politics and politicians regardless of the age and that one might have to grade these people on the curve or be left with no one worth considering "praise worthy" other than failures and nonentities for the simple reason that they never had the opportunity to be corrupt since they never held office or did anything important to begin with.	His main concern is a continuing sense of outrage over the election of 2000 and the "Bush Junta." I think that this has colored his ability to address issues related to the founding fathers in the book and it has has resulted in a greatly inferior product.	To be sure, the writing, the wit is still there, but there is also an annoying audacity much to the discredit of the book and its author.
1,BORING
1,As the title states Beginning Database Design is aimed at people new to database design. The book does a reasonable job introducing this topic but has a fair number of problems.		What I liked:		- Good coverage of the basics - datatypes, ERD, keys, SQL, indexes, normalization, denormalization.		- Exercises at the end of most chapters.		- A case study for an online auction house.		What I disliked:		- The first two chapters can be skipped unless you are completely new to databases.		- The same information is repeated throughout the book sometimes within the same paragraph. While this can be an aid in helping people to learn a new topic it gets old fast.		- Some strange turns of phrase and typographic errors that required me to re-read sections of the book a few times before I understood what the author was saying.		- Not enough exercises.		Overall, a fair introduction whose effect is reduced by repetition and poor writing/editing.		Full disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of the book for review.
1,i got this book after watching montage of heck, hoping to get more insight into kurt cobain...i wish i could say that i did, but that wasn't the case, as this book is a lot of small snippets of journal entries or sketches, nothing really substantial at all. PLUS i felt like a creepy voyeur in the process. this seems like the sort of book that is really only going to appeal to a super hardcore nirvana fan...
1,Disappointing story about a fireman. I think the author just wanted to write about a new York fireman and the story fell flat. The almighty problem ended up being really small and from the build up during the whole story it left the readers flat.		I didn't like the fact that both characters were financially mediocre in my opinion - the hero barely made enough money because we all know firemen are not greatly paid, no offence to the great and noble work they do! The heroine was merely a bar hand and scrimped and Saved for her money so money was not aplenty here!		The story was flat for me and the sex scenes so unrealistic thus were "all" subject of eye-rolls from me. I found that I was skipping the sex scenes as they were overly syrupy! The dialogue was also annoyingly syrupy and unrealistic; it was as if the author was making up for the boring story telling and disingenuous story line.		In the end it was a boring much ado about not much! Waste of my money! Although I finished the story but it was boring. The front picture page was deceptively enticing and didn't deliver!
1,I should have read the description for this book more carefully - I did not realize that the motifs were all based on the bullion stitch.... It's not my favorite stitch by any measure.  The book is very well done as are all in the series that I have looked at to date.  I will keep it - maybe I'll use it for the bullion rose.
1,I love Mel Brooks and think he is one of the most creative and talented people to have ever lived but this book was a total dis-service to the man and his life accomplishments.  The writing is just totally boring and it was a chore just to try and finish the book.  I thought I was reading someone's high school creative writing assignment.  I'll have to wait and read someone else's attempt at capturing Mel's life in book form...
1,An exhausting boring read. Wouldn't have read it if not trapped in a car on a long road trip & gas stations don't sell books anymore. Nothing at all original in here: just a compilation of references.
1,Although most of the reviews here praise this book, it has been largely discredited as essentially a piece of fiction.  Our cultural preoccupation with "multiple personality disorders," "recovered memories of childhood abuse," and "Satanic cult abuse of children" is analogous to the Salem witch trails.  A reader who wishes to see a clear and compelling refutation of this nonsense should read Dr. Paul McHugh's study "Try to Remember: Psychiatry's Clash Over Meaning, Memory, and Mind."  McHugh is a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins.  The reason this is important: many lives have been wrecked as a result of false claims of childhood abuse.
1,I thought this book would be as good as the Stephanie Plum books, but it doesn't even come close.  It was so far fetched and silly it was all I could do to finish it.  Ms. Evanovich is usually so funny, witty but failed big time with this book.
1,Not like the rest of the series.  This VERY short work had none of the twists and turns of the previous books in the series.  No character development, and little mystery.  Loved the first four, but this one was a disappointment.  The author needs to put more effort into the next one or will lose her fans quickly.
1,There is not a person in this book that is likeable. When your main character is a pyromaniac who has not quite gotten himself straightened out, prospects for a happy ending are not good. The main character is extremely jealous, somewhat of a stalker, and completely unaware of his own craziness. You have to wonder about the wife's choice in men. The story of her tear duct surgery, making her blind for two days, made me laugh. I have had that surgery and drove myself to and from the doctor and back to work. I get frustrated in books where so many problems could be avoided or solved if the person would just call the police, rather than making things worse through lies.
1,The following review is based on reading all of the text made available for free on the Kindle.		First, let me say that i am most definitely gay.  Second, that i completely reject the author's stated foundations for understanding gay male culture.  My experience, based on living in the US South, West, including many years in San Francisco, North East and Mid West simply don't fit into the simplified stereotype that the author offers.  What i see as "gay male culture" is as varied as "straight male culture".  Most of us don't care about the bulk of people the author mentions in his book as so central to his understanding.  And to be honest i found what i read insulting.		What it appears the author is reflecting upon is a process that is still developing in which gay men, and i'm sure this is the same for lesbians as well, are experimenting, and searching for, what it means to be gay in and of itself, and, what it means to be gay in a world containing variations on straight culture as the expected dominant form.  To that end we have all played with gender roles, sexual roles, and on and on, but that doesn't mean that behaviors observed within subsets of the gay male world constitute a substantive culture that has any real permanence, especially so early in the process.		To the author i say, stop looking at pop culture as the definition.  Consider what that means about how the straight culture would be interpreted according to that approach.  I don't think the bulk of roles presented on television represent most of the straight men with whom i've worked and played.  I think those caricatures exist for very complex reasons, most of which to be made fun of by all of us so that we are supposed to feel somehow superior.  In fact their lack of depth is key to their success as television idols, so why would you think they represent any of us.  For a good example consider the very popular show The Big Bang Theory; i've worked with the people this show caricatures and that's what it is, an extreme caricature, lacking any substantive depth and definitely not reality.  While i laugh at many of the jokes, and i can see how the caricatures were drawn from reality, i have enough sense to know that i should not project what i observe on The Big Bang Theory onto any of my engineer/scientist friends.		So, in short i suggest that anyone considering reading this book, download the free Kindle reader, if you don't already have a Kindle, and review the text carefully.  I think you will find it is at best a complete waste of time, and at worse, yet another put down of gay men.
1,was a good series.  a another of Linda  Millers BOOKS . A LITTLE TO MUCH ELISAED IN PARTS.  GOOD STORY LINE
1,I just read the book, it was alright. Kinda weird reading. Not interested in reading part 2 of the story
1,Whenever I start a book, I finish it (however long it takes)  With this book, I have a problem.  I started it a while back, and still haven't finished it.  The plot dealing with the present day character is confusing and long drawn out.  The reviewers have compared the writer to Dan Brown and the book to "The Da Vinci Code" (which itself was a terrible book).  The way the book is written it is a misuse of google.  I picked this book at an airport and I regret having doine it (Should have read the brochures they have in flights.  Even that shold have been more interesting)
1,Many times when I purchase a book like this I do so believing that the information is work many many times more than the purchase price. Well, not in this case. I do think that there's $15 worth of knowledge here so in that case it's was worth what I paid for it. The content provided is elementary and provides nothing new. I bought this book because I truly believed that since the extremely rude, arrogant, and self-obsessed author had something new and beneficial to consultants, Well, I am admitting now that I was wrong. What a waste of valuable time.
1,I just don't understand the buzz on this plodding, dull thud of a story. It's boring. I couldn't summon the will to care about the contrived characters. Sorry if that's not popular, but I don't think this story goes anywhere interesting.
1,Writing is actually good, but story line is terrible. It's so predictable and yet so implausible at the same time. The writer makes everything fit together perfectly at the end with an unbelievable and impossible series of events. Several characters die in shipwrecks, earthquakes or freak accidents. How many secret and previously unknown documents can be found in one book? In this case,  the answer is many, my friend. Not worth your time to read.
1,Waste of time and money

1,Eric Sloane is one of my favorite authors.  Great book.
1,This book had some funny stories and moments as a mom I could relate to.  I was not impressed with the amount of alcohol consumption described.  It was just okay to me.
1,The summary for this book is great, but it was a terrible terrible book, I'm done with this author. I don't even understand the ending, I feel like it just stopped without resolving anything, AND I hated girls awful boyfriend.
1,What began as a very interesting story turned out very blah. I'm very disappointed in the way the story ended. It just seemed to stop all of the sudden. I thought it was a very good premise.
1,This could have been a good murder mystery, but it seems the author is more about touting the wonders of her protagonist.  Poor Kay cannot stop suffering due to one thing or the other.  Someone is forever causing her pain because they love her or are jealous of her or in awe of her, and on and on.  It's gotten tedious.  She should be named Wonder Woman and just get it over with.  This murder mystery took place because of all the above.  She also is thrown back into contact with her former investigator who left town after he couldn't take being in love with her day after day; got drunk and almost raped her to his horror.	Another reason she suffers; but she's forgiven him of course because that's the kind of wonderful person she is.  Then there is her husband, who married her right after.  He's boring and another reason she suffers.  It's hard to be so wonderful that the world is forever spinning around what you say and do - filling up newspapers and the airwaves with you or information about you.  The story gets lost in all the adoration of Scarpetta.
1,Had a problem with the main character's attitude. In fact, not much reality in any of the characters or events. I kept reading wanting it to get better but the whole book was like scraping on a blackboard. No good feelings anywhere. Not even a good ending.
1,not going to read due to foul language, I am deleting this book now.
1,I simply do not believe that Jonathan Kellerman wrote this book.  If he did, he was just mailing it in.  What a disappointment.  The writing is extraordinarily bad.  Kellerman is not the greatest writer, but this was just terrible.  What happened?  If you love Kellerman (as I usually do)	do not buy, or read, this book because I'm not sure I will be able to read his next one until the aftereffects of this book wear off.
1,I wanted to like this book but I just couldn't finish it. Obviously the author know almost nothing about pro football. There were so many instances that were impossible. Also, his teammate finds pics of his girlfriend and these have never been found by tabloid mags? REALLY? And the H freaks out and calls her a slut and throws her out? They were nudes NOT porn! This coming for a "pro football player" who has once night stands on a regular basis??And the poisoning part was just to unreal! I just couldn't finish the book. I hope it got better but I will never know. It was a waste of a few hours time.
1,Big name author, but a poorly written book.  Plot obvious to the beginning reader.  Really not worth the time	used to read it.  It couldn't have take much more time than that to write.
1,Populated by trite cookie-cutter characters. Every part of the plot is predictable. It happens in the early chapters for a reason - so that it can be revisited later on during dire circumstances. Boring and stupid. Potted for a seventh grader with characters a 12 year old would appreciat
1,I'm afraid most reviewers here are correct: this is a disappointing novel(la), a sub-par effort that feels lazy and pointless (although pointless acts are something Robbins' characters might actually applaud).		There is too much talk about the actual process of how beer is made (no, I don't think this was commissioned by the beer industry, as another reviewer pointed out, but still...), the characters are not developed to the point where they get interesting and, bluntly put, there is not enough steam to make the wheels go round.		Granted, now and then the narrative releases some of Robbins' wild genius, mostly in the form of witty sentences that bring to mind the gonzo-philosophic musings of his greater works, but the whole remains weak, at best.		Still, I love this author too much and I'm eagerly awaiting for his next novel, hoping, for a start, that it's actually going to be a novel and not some kind of weird experiment that only manages to leave a sour taste in your mouth.
1,Yet another example of a decent story idea presented with such poor writing that I ended up disliking the whole thing on general principle.		Why does the current crop of authors seem to feel that proper writing and editing is an option?  I read a LOT of books -- many of them on my Kindle -- and I'm appalled at the quality of writing being offered.  Grammar rules, common sense, misuse of plurals and possessives, little to no knowledge of which homonyms to use, etc. -- evidently none of that matters in the age of e-books.		All of the complaints listed by the one-star, two-star, and even three-star reviews were the same things that bothered me most.  The long descriptions of food prep (I love to cook, but I found myself skimming the monotonous details), the use of "that" when referring to a person, a character who seemed to have no real place in the book except to suddenly cause trouble and just as suddenly have the trouble resolved...those are but a few of the irritations.		One of the biggest problems I had was trying to figure out who in the world was talking!  Isn't that one of the first rules of writing dialogue?  As soon as someone else starts talking, start a new line and indent.  I had to keep backtracking to revise my perception of where the conversation was headed after finding out the speaker I was picturing wasn't the actual speaker of a certain sentence.		Another major problem was the main character, Chef Nick.  First he's grieving terribly for his wife, who he lost two years ago.  Then when he decides to take the plunge and ask someone out on a date, he's suddenly sleeping with the person and is being very smoothly intimate as if they've had a longer, deeper relationship.  A lot of detail is put into some of those scenes -- with a woman who is pushy and not very likable overall -- and it doesn't have the believable feel of a "first time back on the dating scene" newness or awkwardness.  Yet, when Chef Nick realizes who he truly loves, there is no mention of any passion or development of the new relationship.  It feels like, "oh...yeah...I love you.  OK."  And that's that.  Not that a love scene is called for, but there was no real resolution to how the two of them felt after acknowledging their love.		The way Amy acts towards Nick when their relationship is still boss/employee would be considered highly inappropriate with all the touching, hugging, "I'll help you get through this" stuff going on. I kept thinking, "Who does this in a work environment without it getting very awkward for everyone?"  Again, the intimacy without a real relationship established.		I don't think all the positive reviews are necessarily from friends of the author, as some people tend to think; however, I have to wonder if those great reviews are coming from people who either have a remarkable ability to read while ignoring obviously distracting writing errors, or if those readers don't know enough to realize anything is wrong.
1,I'll give it a two-star benefit of a doubt - maybe I'm missing something. Maybe it just isn't for me. I'm having a very hard time getting through this one. Fortunately, I got it for free as a download from Evernote (thank you!) as I think I'd be pretty torqued if I'd paid for it. As noted in many other reviews, the basic idea is "get rid of stuff that you don't need or doesn't bring you joy." That's it. (I haven't gotten to the "honor your socks" part yet... should be interesting if I make it that far.) Seriously? Am I so materially blessed that one of my biggest challenges in life is having so much stuff that it's a struggle to get rid of it? And worse, this is a task difficult enough to warrant an entire book?
1,Names, places, were very confusing.. Had a hard time placing everything in order. Sorry.
1,I love reading Young Adult Fiction and after seeing this book as a recommendation from other books I've enjoyed, I jumped right in. The plot and characters seemed intriguing, but the book started off very slow. I thought it would pick up but it never did. I just couldn't finish it, I felt like this was too Young adult for me. I couldn't get past the easy read, words like "Uglies,Pretties & Littlies" and I felt no no real suspense or development. Overall I think I just felt too old to read it or enjoy it. This is a very young read.
1,I got about 1/6 through and just couldn't read any more.  I can't bring myself to be interested in a main character that is so poorly thought out.  Or the author purposely made him dense.  Either way.
1,Not what I was needing
1,An okay book wasn't too thrilled with it I bought it thinking there would be deeper conversation about spirit and consciousness not about Wayne Dyers lLove Abraham, following for 20 years not her/they greatest book.
1,I read it for book club but was quite disappointed I did not like the characters and found them to be shallow and unrealistic.  While I liked the idea of people living in a foreign country for extend periods of time I did not feel the author explored the culture of the country.  If I wasn't reading this for book club I would not have finished it.
1,Maybe it's all those reeking, methane-belching manure pits the Amish purportedly own.  Maybe the toxic gaseous emissions are what cause an inordinate number of Amish to become sociopaths and even criminals.	Thank goodness protagonist Police Chief Kate Burkholder managed to escape the abuse that occurred during her Amish upbringing.  And, hopefully, she won't hit an Amish buggy some night while she's driving drunk over those snowy northeastern Ohio backroads.  (Of course, her Amish background would be at fault if she did!)	Author Linda Castillo apparently doesn't know enough about the Ohio Old Order Amish to even describe their attire accurately (married women in white aprons, a man in a summer straw hat in December, a woman in a print dress).  She also seemingly doesn't know that most Amish are not separatists who despise English (non-Amish) people and want nothing to do with mainstream American society.  Or, maybe she does know better, but just wants to portray her Amish characters as mean, resentful, backward folks who meet outsiders with a glare and stony silence.  Such portrayals are drawn in the same negatively caricatured manner in which hillbillies often are, this time in a glossed-over narrative that presents itself as a hate-crimes investigation.  The protagonist pays lip service to the condemnation of anti-Amish stereotypes, yet the author confirms these very notions in her storyline.  Even the Amish food sounds lard-laden and unappetizing.  (And the best apple pie in town is at an ENGLISH bakery!)	If readers want to learn about Amish customs or delve into a fictional mystery that takes an equitable view of the culture, Castillo's works should be considered verboten.  A good alternative is the series of Amish romantic suspense novels by Karen Harper.
1,A balanced book? My goodness,  I started this book and I had to stop after reading the first chapter on the Spanish presence in America. The author is so prejudiced against Spain and so ill informed about the most basic facts about its history that this book can not be taken seriously. As an Imperial power Spain,  contrary to what the angloamericans did in North America, did pass laws to protect the native populations. Spanish universities in the Americas were opened to the Indians, from the College of Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco to the Universities of Santo Domingo or Lima. The Spaniards created International Law ( Victoria, Suarez and the School of Salamanca precisely because it was the first Imperial power to doubt the legitimacy of its own power), as a result the real genocide took place in Angloamerica and not in Hispanic America. It is so obvious that today you go to the US and less than 1% of the population there is Indian,whilst in Mexico, Paraguay or the Andean countries the majority of the population is either native or mixed. As any other Imperial power Spain committed cruelties, but at the same time it created a unique civilization that in the XVIII century was far more advanced than the English colonies in New England ( just read Humboldt). Today the Hispanic world encompasses more than twenty countries and its language and culture is shared by 400 million people. But of course, for the author everything Spain did was evil. And to cap it all he is simply wrong about other facts. Again and again it repeats that Spain was a medieval society at the time of the conquest when in fact it was the first modern State in Europe. Its naval and military power did no decline after the Armada, quite on the contrary, it peaked after it so much so that for the next two hundred years the British were defeated again and again when they tried to conquer Central and South America ( they were only able to grasp some Caribean islands) and the Spanish fleets were able to secure the Imperial links from the Pacific to the Atlantic till the XIX century practically undisturbed.  If you want to have a balance book about Spanish America read John Elliot, Hugh Thomas, Felipe Fernandez Armesto or Lucena Sanmoral. This book is just a mockery of real history.
1,I am glad I got this from the library. If you have read Dave Ramsey there is nothing new here.
1,The only reason I gave it a two star was because I love LA Witt.  Way way too much drama for me, I do like alittle happiness here an there not just at the VERY end geezz.  I understand where the story line was coming from and sometimes everything is not all sun shine and roses but dang this book mad you wanna just give up on a happy life too.  I love LA Witt and all the other books, but this book was one of the worst for me.  Too gloom and doom for me.  I had to force myself to finish the book.  Though the ending was sweet, but I will not be rereading this book again.
1,Given the number of glowing reviews this book has received, I expected a stronger story and a more entertaining read.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  I'm a big fan of Carl Hiaasen.  The story here felt like it was written by someone who'd made a list of all the plot elements in a good Hiaasen novel and then tried to imitate the way Hiaasen's subplots dovetail into a clever climax.  The slow, uneven pacing and the burdensome number of characters left me feeling like I had to make a real effort to read all the way to the end.  I have no interest in reading any more of the Blance County series.
1,I came away utterly exhausted after reading this book.  I adore Stanwyck on screen (and knew of her immense work ethic and generosity with fellow actors), knew she was and could be difficult and difficult to know and wanted to learn more about her.  Wilson's writing and research, clearly, is impeccable (well, not regarding Rudolph Valentino). This book, however, really could have used a machete to cut out all of the filler, the film plots (not just her films, Frank Fay's, Robert Taylor's and even a John Gilbert film thrown in for good measure).  It seems every person who breathed in Stanwyck's vicinity gets at least a paragraph or three.  Even some of the photo captions are really verbose, too much information.  There is way too much context setting, I felt as if I were reading the history of the world concurrent with the life of Barbara Stanwyck.  A book of this magnitude had to have been a labor of love, but was really a labor to get through it.  Not sure if I can gird my loins for the next volume.  I read the kindle edition simply because I did not want to lug the brick and mortar book around.		Jonathan Eig wrote an excellent list of biographer rules, I think #10 fits perfectly.		10. Don't break the 500-page mark, unless your subject served at least one presidential term, fought a couple of wars, and had breakfast on the morning of his Bar Mitzvah with Marilyn Monroe.
1,This was okay. The beginning was promising but the subplots became more interesting than the rather tepid chemistry between E to the F.
1,Could have been a good story, but it was too sexually explicit and I didn't like the language. I wouldn't read any more books from this authorl
1,Not informative
1,"The bedrock of evangelical Christianity, at least as it was taught to me, is the unconditional belief that every word of the Bible is God-breathed and true, literal and inerrant."	These words begin the author's insincere introduction wherein he claims to have converted to Christianity as youth. Yes, perhaps that is what some Evangelical churches believe but as the rather arrogant author of a pretty banal piece of work, shouldn't he be more converse in the attitude toward the Christian gospels (say the Catholic opinion) and less "crushed" than he claims he was to find that the canonized gospels were actually a Roman Catholic tradition? Perhaps he was misled since he is (was?) islamic and they view the Quran as absolute (see abrogations). Maybe the devil was living in his nose?		It's an appalling read. Not really sure why Christians are so afraid of it. He takes small, insignificant differences and highlights them as if they are profundities of the greatest magnitude with an "arrogant" attitude of YOU MUST AGREE WITH THIS OR YOU ARE AN IDIOT.		Let's take a single example, early on in the book. He highlights a contradiction:		"I was sent solely to the lost sheep of Israel"; Matthew 15:24, the next, of benevolent universalism ("Go and make disciples of all nations"; Matthew 28:19);		If you notice this contradiction lies on the word "solely" in the first passage. So two thousand years ago, when Christianity was forming in the turbulent hotbed of 1st century middle east, the word "solely" makes a profound difference among the two statements, the first allocates Christianity to just another Jewish cult, the other making it Universal among all men. The wonder of the Christian gospels isn't the minor inconsistencies among them - there are some, of course. Anyone who translates from one language to another will easily recognize this problem. The true wonder of the gospels is the amazing consistencies among them.		A lot of the book is rehashed DaVinci code (maybe he snored through it? Or maybe he smelled some bucks?). He fails to see that his analysis is the greatest contradiction of all. He constantly throws out the source "Q" which any half-hearted Christian scholar would recognize as the alleged source book for all the books of the New Testament. If these differences were so profound or, excuse me let me use his arrogant "scholarly" attitude, were so "troubling" how come he recognizes, (and constantly repeats it in case the DaVinci Code was playing and we were asleep) that the gospels came from a single source?		I love this line when talking about the gnostic gospels:	"these books are significant in that they demonstrate the dramatic divergence of opinion that existed over who Jesus was and what Jesus meant"		Not really - it sounds like rehashed DaVinci code to me. Every religious figure of the day had many texts written about them. Heck, the Jews basically accept a large number of books that aren't even officially canonized. Is that "troubling"?		So here's the problem and he recognizes it early. We have a single source book for the gospels, regardless of the "gnostic" gospels which help to enlighten the man that Jesus really was - so all his attempts to discredit and highlight the gaping contradictions among the books are doomed to fail. And anyone who reads the gospels will find, unlike in the Quran (written 700 years later and borrowing a bunch from those "other" gospels), which I have read, the contradictions to be at worst meaningless and are usually quite insignificant. The Old Testament is very different but we aren't discussing that book. In addition, although he does bring up the issue of some of the apostles dissension, they clearly came to a consensus that St. Paul was right and Jesus was divine. He seems to forget that St. Peter was walking a fine line in the early days of the Church with the heavily influential and much larger population of Israeli Christians while following the Pauline doctrine of Jesus's divinity in Rome.		All in all, I think the problem isn't so much the book it's the reviews. I'm appalled at the good reviews it's gotten. If this had been written 10-15 years ago it would have relevance and I could see the acclaim. Today it's boring and, I believe, disingenuous.
1,Very onesided. I totally disagree with her.
1,I do not recommend this book for reading material.  With the nerd that I am, I actually like to learn by reading textbooks.  And I like sciency reads.  But this book was hard to read.  I do not recommend it as your advanced nutrition resource.
1,Fahrenheit 451 seemed reminiscent of 1984 in many ways. Individual thought and expression is suppressed, intellect frowned upon, and a war is waging on for an indeterminate amount of time. However, I did not like the story nor the characters of Fahrenheit 451 nearly as much. Montag came across as weak and pathetic, even when he was rebelling and supposedly thinking for himself for a change. And the minor characters all irritated me to no end. Each time I thought the book showed insight or progress (toward a better narration), something happened which squelched it. The premise itself is fascinating and all to scary (and possible!). Yet, the story fell short for me in the end.
1,though i thought some of the emotion was toucing, overall it was awful.  very predictable plot, the villians are easy to spot.  i didn't like the relationship between the leads.  overall i don't recommend
1,I read this book expecting it to be about the 1905 US goodwill tour to the Pacific headed by Secretary of War William Howard Taft, but this is not what the book is actually about.  The goodwill tour is only used as a thematic device for a screed against the policies of Teddy Roosevelt.  In spite of the subtitle of this book, there is nothing in it that was secret and that has not already been discussed in other books.  This book only differs to the degree to which Bradley takes disparate information and molds it to meet a preconceived idea, namely that Theodore Roosevelts policies regarding the US involvement in Asia were responsible for the US war against Japan in WWII.  I found Bradleys ideas to be somewhat simplistic and biased. However, I do not rate books based in how much I agree or disagree with the position taken by the author, but rather on the quality of the book itself, and in this case I was appalled by complete lack of balance and objectivity shown by Bradley. This book might have been a more interesting and readable book if Bradley had spent more time on a dispassionate analysis of ALL of the information, and less time excoriating the US.  If you read this book be aware that this is a one sided polemic, not a history book.		I have studied this period of history and have found little new information regarding the US involvement in the Philippines, and with Japan and China, and I have read enough to realize that Bradley is presenting only one side of the story.  A good history book should present all sides of the story and then explain why the author considers one viewpoint may be more valid than the other.  Unfortunately, Bradley presents only one side, the side that depicts the US as committing atrocities, committing genocide and leading an Aryan crusade to control the world, and to oppress the noble savages that they find in less developed countries.  (Bradley spends a lot of time discussing the idea of the Anglo-Saxons of the US and Britain being a successful Aryans driving westward to dominate the world.  According to Bradley, the British planted the Aryan flag in the US and the US carried it across the continent and then into Asia.)		More details -	Several reviewers have already pointed out numerous instances where Bradley distorts the record by leaving out material, and focusing only on the most negative aspects of anything that the US did.  I will cite only a few that I think that most readers should be familiar with.		When discussing China and the Chinese in America, he points out that the famous photograph showing the driving the golden spike, denoting the completion of the transcendental railroad, does not show any of the Chinese workers who were instrumental in its construction.  Bradley says that they were pushed aside so as not to be in the photograph.  However, historians who have looked closer into this question report that the reason for the absence of the Chinese was because they were being honored at a banquet when the photograph was taken.	At the end of the book Bradley remarks that when one travels from Manhattan to Roosevelts Sagamore Hill estate, they will find many Koreans living on that part of Long Island, and implies that Roosevelt would be surprised to see such uncivilized people being so successful.  However, a more balanced reading of Roosevelts life shows that while he did make racist statements he also believed that people would eventually rise to the level of what he believed was the superior Anglo-Saxon status.  Thus, he would not have been surprised to see Korean-American prosper.		Almost any book covering Roosevelt and this period of world history discusses what today we recognize as his being a racist.  However, in this book there is little or no discussion of the fact that he was quite liberal compared to most others of the time.  There is no mention of his attempts to support black office holders or his willingness to meet with black leaders a social basis.  I think that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to judge Roosevelt and the US of the period with current standards, with no discussion of how his actions compared to those of other leaders, or how his views evolved over time.		Bradley presents all the people that the US comes into conflict with as being noble and having a superior culture than the US.  For instance, he touts the government under the Tokugawa Shogunate as being a time of peace, tranquility and a flowering of the arts in Japan.  It may have been peaceful, but it was a peace of a military dictatorship that ran a feudal society where the peasants had no rights.  He blames the US for having opened Japan to the rest of the world and therefore for the restoration the emperor of Japan to the status of being a ruler instead of a figurehead of the shogunate.  The clear implication is that Japan would have remained an isolated medieval society had the US under Admiral Perry not intervened, and that the US was therefore somehow responsible for Japan attacking the US in 1941.  Perry may have shown the Japanese how backward their nation had become, but any objective reading of Japanese history shows that the shogunates days were numbered and it would eventually have been overthrown without Perrys visit.		Roosevelt was no saint, but disserves better than the hatchet job performed by Mr. Bradley. The book presents only those incidents, statements and statistics that seem to back up the points that he wants to make, with absolutely no mention of any disagreement among scholars regarding their accuracy.  Bradley goes so far as to criticize Roosevelts biographers for being taken in by Roosevelts self-promotion and the favorable light in which he is depicted in most books.  In effect, he saying that only he and the books that he used as source material have been smart enough to see the true Roosevelt, but he does not present any of the details that might allow the reader to judge the material that he presents.		I could go on and on, but I will stop, as this review is already too long and because many of the specific distortions in the book have already been discussed in other reviews.
1,As a fan of the Odd Series, we felt this recent installment skewed far from what made the other books so good.  Odd Thomas has lost the innocence and wonder that made him likable.  Instead of encountering everyday ghosts and isolated catastrophes, he is now battling world-wide destruction.  The encounters seemed overboard and silly.  Dodging bullets.  Killing sprees.  This is not Odd.	Plus the whole 'mysterious' girl who refuses to answer any inquires is simply annoying and frustrating.  He must be priming her for a future book, but here it was a waste with no closure.  At least tease us with some purpose or indirect bites.	Hopefully, this is not the path Odd Thomas will continue on.  Hopefully, Odd can return to his roots and make the story interesting again.
1,Worst. Editing. Ever.
1,This book has got to be one of the most difficult to read books I've ever bought. The story is fine, the characters are fine, the scenario and even the prose are all fine. The problem is the incredibly short chapters, with a cliffhanger at the end of each one.	If I could say one thing to the author, it would be that it doesn't take 9 cliffhangers to get through a single scene! Especially not the opening scene of a book.		Sorry, but I can't recommend this to anyone. Trying to read past the constant chapter breaks and 'ominous' cliffhangers just isn't easy enough to be worth doing.
1,First book was decent. Second book....no.	Crying about being chubby all the time and seeing fat-shaming in every word out of peoples mouths does not give anyone the right to treat people like toys, make stupid drunk decisions, overreact and act like a child, and nail everyone with a pulse. And to clear it up, shacking up with men constantly is not liberating. Deadbeat moms that are busy shacking up, not liberating. Talking like a sailor with a brain cell shortage, not liberating. And the "woe is me" stuff doesn't excuse acting like a trashy slut and being an emotional brick that denies all depth of feeling and instead turns to treating men like objects to satisfy some twisted "make me feel better about myself" need.	It's so disappointing to always see women written in such stupid roles.
1,This pocket guide is OK for showing you what the tracks look like; however, it doesn't differentiate between walkers, bounders, wide walkers/waddlers and leapers.  Nor does it tell you what the stride or straddle is, which is a very important aspect. I instead opted for the Mammal Tracker pocket laminated card from Interpretive Wildlife Programs and blew it up a bit (it's kinda small otherwise) and bring a plastic ruler with me. For decent tracking you need to know 1) how big the prints are, 2) the formation they're in, 3) the length of the stride and 4) the width of the straddle. Of course, a basic understanding of the habits and habitat of the mammals you are tracking goes a long way to narrowing things down. If you aren't sure, lay your ruler down next to the prints and take a picture; then you can study it when you get home. Above all...have fun! Try tracking one set of prints as far as they go; you might get lucky and find a den, lay or the animal itself!
1,Disappointed in this book after reading the The Ladies Room. This book doesn't have much substance. Maybe the younger generation would enjoy it better.
1,Shame on APA for publishing the new version 6 manual with so many errors, including the sample/example pages that are used by instructors and students. I purchased the first printing in August, 2009.	Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th ed.)
1,I was tempted to stop reading halfway through but decided to continue to see how the book ended. Weird. The book seemed disorganized and flitted from one thing to another. Light writing with no depth and sneaking in the religious aspect didn't make sense and could have been left out since it didn't add anything to the story. Mitzy is not a very knowledgeable or realistic real estate broker...many mistakes. Very disappointing.
1,Did not like the storyline
1,The Pluto Files chronicles the history of Pluto, from its' discovery in 1930 to the more recent debate about its' classification as a planet.  Tyson takes a mostly unbiased approach to this debate, with lots of quotes from other scientists giving an overview of the issue.  The book also includes lots funny cartoons about Pluto, which were by far my favorite part of the book!		In addition to the pictures and the cartoons, the book is written in a very accessible away.  Even late elementary school students could probably read it, a target demographic that makes sense given the many elementary school students outraged about Pluto's demotion.  This was by far the easiest to read of all my non-fiction reads so far.		On the down side, there wasn't much depth to this book.  I like to read micro-histories for the fun people stories involved in the history of even the most mundane of objects.  This book didn't include many of those personal stories.  Instead, the book covered the same few arguments for and against planet-hood over and over again using enough quotes that the writing felt a little choppy.  At the end of the day, this wasn't a bad book, but I would only recommend it to a younger reader or to someone looking for a very brief overview of Pluto's history.
1,While the author clearly knows what he's talking about, his experience and consequently his book is not very useful to the reader. Why ? Because first of all there is a very wide gap between knowing and doing. Secondly the book gets quickly repetitive and confusing with a series of what the author calls matrixes which may have been intended to look scientific and serious but they are actully more of a hindrance than a help ... Couldn't finish the book.
1,I wanted to like this book but from the very first chapter I had a bad feeling about it.  I wasn't comfortable with all of the Bible verses and references.  Overall though, this book does not lead the reader anywhere.  There are hardly any recipes or suggestions for weight loss.  Candace doesn't even try to stress the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  It's almost as if she's only promoting a "quick fix" solution.	As the book progresses, the chapters all basically contain a superficial, generic re-hash of everything common-sense notion you've heard about weight loss.	I was also put-off by the self-promotion Candace does, in mentioning her TV show, her merchandise and speaking engagements multiple times in the book.  She even promotes her young daughter's acting roles. Why not save that information for an autobiography? It doesn't belong in a weight loss book.	I would've liked to have read a lot more about her days on the set of Full House and how it affected her as a child star.	If you want a good book to read, get Jodie Sweetin's autobiography instead of this.  It's a lot more in-depth and realistic.
1,This book contains some of the most hackneyed mystery writing I have encountered in a long time. As other reviewers have noted the stuff on police using typewriters feels like the 1980's grafted onto post 9/11 America. It doesn't make any sense. I am sure that even in New Mexico the police have been using computers for a long time. Don't bother.
1,The book was written well enough to keep me interested until the end, although it dragged about as slowly as a it could.		In the end the book was very unsatisfying. Nothing was ever explain and at no point was there ever an attempt to do so. Further, nothing was wrapped up.
1,I can't believe I spent so much money on Just Ella!  To me it wasn't good enough. It didn't have enough romance, fairy-taleness, overall, it just wasn't interesting enough. When I think Cinderella, I think fairy tales.  Personally, I like the whole happily-ever-after kinda thing. Ella Enchanted  was my idea of a good spin of Cinderella. Ella wasn't as 3 dimensional as  the Ella in Ella Enchanted. I couldn't "see" and "feel"  Ella.	Just Ella was more realistic, but not as interesting. Ella is a  peasant, and she wins her prince in wits instead of looks- even though she  is pretty. So when she moves into the palace to start Queen training, she  discovers that Princie was as interesting and charming as he was when they  were dancing. She also found  out that the palace wasn't as wonderful as  she had imagined. Everyone is rude to her, and treats her as an outsider.  Ella also has to live a  live, claiming that she is some foreign  princess.	So during her training, one of her teachers drops dead, and his  son takes over. Obviously, she  falls in love with the guy. Then the guy -  I forgot his name- decides to run a refugee camp. I found that  whole camp  thing so corny. Why read about camps when it is always on Cnn?  Well, I  don't want to read about camps, anyway. So  Ella runs after her tutor and  they live happily- ever-after, running a refugee camp.
1,The recipes and wine suggestions are all right, but the plot is improbable, and the characters are badly drawn.  People fall in love for no particular reson and murder one another for even fewer reasons.  It took me forever to wade through it even though it is a short easy read.
1,It was okay. But with all due respect, some of these women were annoying. Others completely admirable, none of them too happy while in office.		Truth be told, America and it's presidents were never much interesting to me. Yes, some great things happened in America, but it's leaders most of the time are not so interesting.		Yet, I wanted the female POV on the white house and the presidential job. And they were informative. But not much more.		Thanks to the publisher for the arc
1,Book would be fun for younger readers.  To be fair, I don't typically like fantasy and while there is a message here, I like it delivered in a somewhat different style
1,Cute series title - Spookie Town Murder Mystery.  But this book isn't all that spooky or mysterious.		The story:  it's a bit bland and washed down with more telling than showing.  Not a lot happens.  Because it's a short read, it was easy to get through.  The mystery is not really a mystery because it was obvious who did what.  The main character, Abigail, was not fleshed out well and was inconsistent in her actions and thoughts.  Is she a strong female or isn't she?  Is she independent or isn't she?  Spookie isn't really that spooky of a town as more as it's a busy-body town.		The writing:  it's a bit bland with repetition and inconsistencies.  There are contradictions in some of the explanations and some of the facts.  There are tons of truncated or incomplete sentences that really feel jarring.  There are grammar issues and wrong words.  The writing doesn't flow together.		I got enough out of this book and these characters to satisfy my interest.  Book #2 is not in my future.
1,poor writing
1,If the writer knew how to proofread this might not be all that bad. What the book really needs is a decent editor, and the writer making his character less of a blubbering baby. We all go through hard times, but constantly crying isn't the best way to cope.
1,I remember hating this book, finding itnboring, and unablee to relate to the characters -- well beyond superficial differences.  I grew up outside Chicago.
1,Bought series for child but not giving it to them until they are older because it contains the n word.
1,I was looking for a book about fabric postcards and ATCs and I had high expectations about this one, but I has been highly disappointed: the book has poor descriptions and very few useful informations. I come back to it every now and often to see if perhaps my understandings are better and I'm able to see what other customers have seen rating it with 4-5 stars, but so far every time I think it has been a bad idea to buy it.
1,I'm one of the ones who pre-ordered this book and waited impatiently through the recurring delays for the release of this book. I had high hopes that Martin would not sucker his fans into having to buy yet another book after this one to get to the end of this story. This seems to be the trend with fantasy authors these days, and frankly, I'm getting fed up with it. This book needed some heavy editing, and if it had been edited, maybe yet another book would not have been necessary. I was very taken with Martin's writing style in the first three books, and I found it refreshingly different, but when it's strung out, it can be excruciatingly boring. I will not pre-order the next book, but will wait for good reviews before buying. Caveat emptor!
1,I'm.giving this book two stars only because I know there are worse books out there. I have no idea why anybody would give it four, let alone five stars.	First, the book could be shortened to 100 pages or less and you wouldn't miss anything. Page after page of Charly wondering if she should get together with Aaron. Then many more pages of how great it is once they got together.	But the main flaw is Charley spends weeks being called names, being verbally abused, and finally getting beaten by Ella, and as she's out running Ella, who just happens to be chasing her in a car, she says to herself "Oh God, Ella really wants to hurt me."	In the acknowledgement at the end of the book the author is happy she now has a publisher instead of being self published, and thanks numerous people for their hard work.  How come they all missed the use of the non word disorientated?  Twice.
1,Here's the problem with this book in a nutshell.		The author took everything he liked from other books, arranged them as a checklist, and then proceeded to try and write them in one by one.		The plot is flimsy to the point of crumbling the moment you look at it.	The political backstory is about as well thought out as a child trying desperately to describe our current election.	The main character isn't very likable and isn't very skilled. He's the worst of both worlds. He tries desperately to be any number of "cool" and "witty" heroes but just comes across as shallow. And stupid. Incredibly stupid. On top of that, his main super power is, and i'm not kidding, get his butt kicked.		Do yourself a favor. Skip this. Go read Harry Dresden (Jim Butcher) or Cursed and Damned (Glenn Bullion). You'll thank me.
1,Truthfully, I bought this book because it bore the name Nora Roberts as the author. However, After reading a couple of chapters I have put it down. I don't like the sentence flow.  Two stars?  Well I gave on extra because I liked the title.
1,This book is terrific if you're looking for stories from the 1930s and 1940s.  While it is interesting, it is not what I wanted from this book- so I was disappointed.
1,Too many references to current unimportant celebrities and maybe not written for a forty something crowd. I skipped most of the pages to get to the interesting parts.
1,I don't care for this author tho I was curious about her book , I feel I  too biased to give an opinion on the book
1,It is nice they say size of hook and quantity of yarn but none of the patterns say what kind of yarn. Would it be baby, sport, worsted weight or bulky. It might even be thread. It would be nice to know what the yarn weight is that is required for each pattern.
1,Anne Rice has long been one of my favorite authors.  The magic of her writing is her ability to create a world or society out of historical references, mythology and folklore.  Be it the free people of color in New Orleans (The Feast of All Saints), Italy's castrati (Cry to Heaven), vampires or an inbred, spirit-beguiled family (The Witching Hour), Anne sucks us in, demonstrating a plausable and possible society or world even though you know she is creating it all.  Her historical references and her drawing upon mythology create a spell-binding story that lead this reader to read most of her novels over and over again.  Some are better than others.  That happens to any author.  This book, however, is the worst attempt I have read from her.		The book is boring.  The characters are shallow and flat.  There is none of her witchery with words in creating another believable world.  I had stopped reading her when she started writing the religious books.  That is not for me.  I thought that this book was a departure from that trend.  I don't think so.  The final dissertation on the nature of good, evil and God left me quite cold.  This book is a fiasco.  Even though Rice is one of the few authors that I pre-order, I will not make that mistake in the future.  This  could have been a great book.  It, unfortunately, is one her worst.
1,First, know what you're getting into. While the cover material, blurbs, and even the first chapter suggest that this is a book of stories, sometimes funny and sometimes sad, of patients Dr. Holland saw in the ER, it's not. More words are spent recounting her medical school sexual escapades and her conflicts with other doctors than describing patients, their stories, and their illnesses.		Second, be warned that Dr. Holland manages to come across as a person with very poor interpersonal skills in this book. There are chapters full of her swearing she has a natural gift for empathy, then totally failing to navigate rudimentary interactions with her coworkers and employers. As with any memoir, the reader must assume that not only are they not getting the whole story, they're getting it through the eyes of the author. This usually means events are slanted in favor of the author. If the stories she recounts are her version, i dread to imagine what an objective account would be.		So if you're actually looking for a memoir of a psychiatrist's time working in a psych ER in Manhattan, and you don't mind wincing a lot as she does really stupid things, you may enjoy this volume. For the rest of us, it's a disappointment at best.
1,Absolute fantasy, but don't take my word for it.  Search on the author's name and read some of the investigative journalism news stories on this man's body of work and the claims he makes.  Perlmutter's claims are based on very selective science and his own opinions which actually change a lot from book to book.  For example, in Grain Brain he claims cholesterol & saturated fat are good for you (which I actually happen to believe which is why I bought the book in the first place) but in the next book, the same two items are bad for you.  But the books enhance his own personal empire.  Please, take a look at what this man is selling!  Check out his websites.  You can drop a fortune with him regularly.		Perlmutter is, however, an excellent writer and he makes his books very readable, exciting, and engrossing.  He's a great storyteller.  Too bad his motivation seems to be for financial gain.
1,Ernest Shackleton accomplished arguably superhuman things. He was good at selecting, cajoling and inspiring men. How he brought his crew back alive from such a frozen, forbidding world, is one of the amazing miracles of the past two hundred years.	Yet a close, hard look suggests that the leadership lessons to be learned are limited for most readers. The authors try too hard to take each Shackleton episode or act as a lesson tobe learned and applied yet these lessons are not as clear as the authors might want to suggest nor are the lessons necessarily generalizeable to modern life or commerce. After reading the entire book, little remains to explain Shackleton's theory or practice of leadership, just a lot of anecdotes and incidents. Shackleton and his leadership remain inscrutable.	An amazing story, yes. An amazing leadership book, I think not.
1,Reading this book is like having a heart-to-heart talk with Mr. Garner himself.  It is pleasant and easy reading as well as self-descriptive and personal.  Just make certain you will not be offended by his left wing politics prior to reading.		There is one problem that looms heavy in my mind.  Like another recently published autobiography, (Florence Henderson), it does not contain an index!  Speaking for myself, there are those times after reading a book, I like to go back over certain items, however, without an index, this process is time consuming at best.  I consider this a cheat and would like to know beforehand if the volume is indexed or not.
1,I wanted to like this book.  I enjoyed collide and pulse and I assumed this would me a great series too.  Wow I was majorly wrong.	SPOILERS	The female character is just awful. At first I thought she was a strong character just fighting her past conflicts. But she is needy and plain stupid. Loving 2 men is one thing but having sex with both is not okay. Especially if you are committed to one of them.	The guys characters...what can I say yeah they ooze sex appeal but seriously what happened to the "bro code" of not hooking up with your best friends girl. Even if you are "given permission".	Not that isn't enough to turn your stomach then you have drugs and murders to deal with too.	I'm not a prude by any means but the book was about a girl meets guys has sex sex sex  loves both etc etc and gets caught up in their side business.	No romance here folks...just a whole lot of drama "choose me" and shady business.	So disappointed!
1,Not good. Why would anyone want a guy who nails anything in a skirt, or pants for that matter. He's just gross. So inconceivable that we are supposed to believe he could be faithful to one woman.
1,The comparison to The Princess Bride is unwarranted. Everything Princess Bride does well, this story does badly. (Actually, that's not true. The world-building in this novel is pretty good. Not as good as Princess Bride, but not awful.)		First, it's dreadfully slow. Painfully slow. Downright boring. It takes forever for anything to happen. If you put this book down to go make a cup of tea, you'll find some other more engaging task to distract you before you can get back to the book, like folding laundry or watching paint dry.		Second, the characters are flat and not at all engaging. The most interesting people we meet are two highwaymen pretty early in the tale. Kit's a bit amusing, with his excess of honesty, but in all he doesn't sound at all like a person who's been through the life he lead. In fact, he doesn't really sound like anything.		Third, the plot is generic. Unwitting lad takes up his master's unfinished tasks, meets girl in peril, etc etc.		Really, the best thing about this book is the title. I quite like that title.
1,I finished reading the book though I'm not sure it was worth the effort. No depth to story or characters.
1,There is a decent plot here with the twists I would expect from a thriller, but the leaps of faith we are required to make are amazing. Every character is so trusting. Unbelievably trusting. And that is why one star. The writing isn't great either, but trying to get from one plot point to another, the author uses just the most inane dialog. i just couldn't believe any of it. With the imagination the author has, maybe a few books down the road will have the characters saying things I will actually believe and behaving in ways that people actually behave.
1,I just found the story and the writing juvenile. The incest, which is a pivoting point, is predictable in the first chapter "the twisting doornob" Also, how realistic is it to think that in today's world, you can keep a child without any  Lovestruck teens; I think this may be a good read for a 9th or 10th grader.
1,What to say. I suppose if you enjoy the supernatural and have a weird imagination you might enjoy this book. All the while I was reading I thought for sure Justin was dreaming although would have been a long dream.
1,I love the Davenport series but hate abridged books. I don't have time to sit and read so listening to books while I drive is the best for long commutes.
1,This book was a waste of my time. Redundant, predictable, silly. Piles of coincidences, resulting in a plot that is completely unbelievable.
1,Not the most engaging story I've read. Maybe it's not meant for adults
1,Just not enough instruction / illustration. But I suppose it would work for some who can read between lines. I don't have that talent.
1,The back and forth timeline was annoying. The ending stinks. I can't say much more without giving away the plot and ending.
1,Did not like anything about it. Penny trying to be psychological. The characters are unbelievable. Two  brothers and two sisters quarrel viciously and their mother is cold and cruel too. This in the middle of a family reunion at a swanky place at the lake. I never understood while these hateful people agreed to another family reunion. These vicious quarrels go on and on and on. I love surprise endings, but this was too, too implausible. The murderer did it because he was misunderstood and just needed someone to say they were sorry. I've read others by Penny. By far, they are better.
1,Thomas Harris has a lot to answer for: ever since he published The Silence of the Lambs, his 1998 novel featuring Dr. Hannibal Lechter, yarns about psychosexual sadists who commit serial slayings have become the default setting for murder fiction.		It is no longer enough to simply have a killer who commits an ingenious homicide: nowadays the villain has to kill at least a half dozen people to get the average readers attention.		Give the authors some credit: they recognize that in real life you will find more corpses after a makeshift bomb explodes on a Kabul street corner than in an entire bookshelf full of fictional serial killer yarns, so simply increasing the body count is no longer enough to hold a readers interest.	And catching the bad guy  or girl  is not enough, regardless of how clever the detectives are or how difficult their task may be; the detectives must stop the perpetrator before he kills again  and again, ad nauseam. As a result, it seems that murder techniques grow more complex and technical, the locales more exotic and the motives more bizarre in each new thriller that is produced.		James Patterson		Thus, in his latest novel, Private Berlin, James Patterson, author of Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls, comes up with a deranged German killer named Matthias Falk who is systematically eliminating people  including one of the investigators for Jack Morgans global detective agency, Private.		(In this review I refer to the novel as Pattersons work. Admittedly, Mark Sullivan shares a byline with Patterson on this and one other novel in the Private series, but lets face it: Patterson is the real draw; according to his entry in Wikipedia, he has written 97 books in the last twenty years. By comparison, Sullivan is relatively unknown: his webpage pegs his output at eleven books  and two of those were written with Patterson.)		Co-author Mark Sullivan		Somehow, I seem to have missed James Pattersons work in the past. God knows how  the man is a fiction factory who cranks out books for adults, graphic novels and childrens fiction at a dizzying pace. He has managed to sell more than 260 million copies of his books in the last two decades, so when this one showed up on the New York Times bestseller list, I decided to give it a try.		I have probably spent ten dollars more foolishly, but I cant recall when.		Heres the recap:		The body count begins when the corpses of two people  one of them the missing gumshoe from Morgans agency -- are found in a long-abandoned East Berlin slaughterhouse. The corpses have apparently been tortured and literally fed to rats that live beneath the facility. Moreover, they are only the most recent bodies to have been stashed in this secret hidey-hole; the tunnels beneath the abattoir are filled with the decomposed remains of dozens of other victims, some obviously dead for years.	Morgans firm marshals an investigative team, at first to search for the missing op, and then, after his body is found, to find out who killed him and why. One member of the team is detective Mattie Engel, who had been engaged to marry the murdered man until she broke the relationship off six weeks earlier. Most of the story is told from her point of view, although in a third person format that allows Patterson considerable narrative freedom.		To solve the murder, Morgans sleuths must track down a psychopath who has methodically erased himself from all German records and is also a master of disguise capable of taking on a new identity at the drop of a hat  or, in some cases, wig.		More importantly, they must find out what the connection is between the people that Falk has killed.  Only by ferreting out the murderers past can they account for his present  and ascertain who it is he will try to kill next.		The chase proceeds with the detectives locked in a struggle with the German police commander in charge of the criminal investigation. For reasons that are not initially clear, this police Commissar seems determined to steer the probe away from the bodies found in the slaughterhouse.		The body count continues to climb and each time Morgans investigators get close to the killer, he slips through their grasp. Then, after a breakthrough that shows them the connection between the people already slain, Morgans detectives are finally able to figure out the motive. Will they catch Falk in time to save his remaining targets?  Will the German police arrest the serial killer or continue to ignore the leads the private investigators have uncovered? To find out, you will simply have to read the book. I have disclosed more than enough already without revealing the ending.		On the other hand, you may want to skip this one entirely, even though it is selling like hotcakes and managed to find a spot in the New York Times top fiction list since it was released earlier this year. The reason? Despite the best efforts of Patterson and Sullivan, Private Berlin simply isn't very interesting.		Considering what the authors have to work with, this is surprising: the action takes place in contemporary Germany; one subplot involves connections to the brutal East German secret police while another involves dens of prostitution where sado-masochistic sex is a specialty; and the murders range from private confrontations to a public assassination at an auto show in front of thousands of people. But even with all these things going for it, Private Berlin is a lot of empty prattle that seems to have become a bestseller because thats what Patterson writes (his books have made the New York Times list 76 times since he retired from the advertising game and went full-time as an author).		Jack Morgan, who has played a key role in some of Pattersons other novels about his crack international investigative agency, only takes up space in this story, letting other characters do all the heavy lifting in a way that makes you wonder why he bothered to fly in from the U.S. on the firms private jet. Another character is a middle-aged forensic genius who is given to wearing his graying long hair in a pony tail and sporting T-shirts advertising rock n roll bands (an amalgam of NCISs Ducky and Abby?). Still another is a tough counter-terrorism expert who is physically imposing, but dumb enough to show light in a darkened forest so the villain can shoot him, effectively taking him out of the action at a critical juncture. Engels immediate boss seems to have been included in the book primarily to upbraid her ace investigator for not following company procedures.		Most of the people in the book remind me of those corny cardboard cutouts of celebrities they display at county fairs so you can get a picture standing next to Obama, Marilyn Monroe or somebody else famous: they look like real people but none of them have any substance.		And heres an epic fail: the serial killer, himself, is basically a non-entity. Unlike Hannibal Lechter, whose character was so skillfully drafted by Thomas Harris that he cast a dark shadow over RedDragon and dominated The Silence of the Lambs, even though he was not the actual villain in either book, Pattersons murderer, Mr. Falk, is simply a collection of random characteristics in Private Berlin.		When we have finished with all 448 pages of this pot-boiler, the impression we have of the man is that he likes rough trade sex, knows hundreds of ways to kill people, thinks he is smarter than everybody else in the world and has a couple of annoying speech tics  including ending sentences on a rising inflection with the word Hmmm? and making a clicking sound in the back of his throat when he is happy. These, incidentally, appear to have been added to the character merely so he would have some recognizable features to justify the action.		In a genre in which a believable serial killer has become an absolute requirement, Patterson goes through the motions in Private Berlin.  This failure to create a memorable villain is doubly infuriating considering that Patterson interlaces his third person narrative with a number of chapters in which his murderer directly addresses the reader in the first person. These soliloquies would be a perfect place to engender some reader interest in the villain.		For whatever reason, Patterson fails to make effective use of them.  In the final confrontation, Mattie Engel is forced to quiz Falk about why he has done all these terrible things, just like a detective in a English cozy published in the 1930s. Despite its reliance on high-tech detection and its 21st Century setting, Private Berlin climaxes in a classic drawing room interview with the investigator  only without the Earl Grey and buttered scones.		All these flaws are deal-breakers in my opinion, but the real reason I cant recommend Private Berlin is its idiot plot.		As the novel makes clear, the only reason Falk is bumping his victims off is because they all have some connection to a life that he has already effectively erased. He calls himself The Invisible Man, and likens himself to the character played by Claude Rains in the old Universal horror film based on H.G. Wells novel: he has changed his identity, changed his appearance and built a new profession so removed from his past that nobody would normally give him a second look.		All he has to do is leave Germany and take a new home in another country. But while he is humping a prostitute in a brothel owned by an Eastern European gangster, one of his past victims recognizes his voice. His voice, mind you  she doesnt even see his face because he is wearing a mask. Falk finds out and instead of taking the substantial fortune he has amassed from victims he murdered in his past life and fleeing the country, he sets up a laborious plot to methodically eliminate a handful of people who do not know he even still exists. After which he apparently intends to start a new life somewhere else, anyway.		Instead, he lingers and kills, drawing unnecessary attention to himself in the process.		Let me clarify why this is idiot plot in all its rank stupidity: all the Private investigator has to go on is a secondhand report from someone who recognized the voice of a masked man in a brothel. He still does not know the mans new name, what he looks like, where he resides, or how he earns a living. Despite this, this ace detective arranges to meet Falk at the slaughterhouse  without contacting anybody at his agency to tell them where he will be or what he is doing.		But wait, theres more: not only does the detective have bupkus, but it turns out that the woman who recognized Falks voice has already been murdered when he gets to the slaughterhouse. This means everything the dead woman told him is hearsay and of no evidentiary value. So without a first-hand witness, there is no reason for Falk to lure him there and kill him in the first place.		I expect the criminals in an Elmore Leonard or George V. Higgins novel to do stupid stuff like this because they are portrayed by their authors as half-smart  people just intelligent enough to get themselves into trouble. By contrast, Falk is supposed to be a master criminal, an evil genius, but to me it is obvious no one but a moron would do what he does.		In the final analysis, it may be the more exotic aspects of Private Berlin that doom the book from page one. Patterson and his co-author spend so much time and energy talking about high tech detection methods, post-wall German real estate, computer technology, ex-Stasi thugs, Russian gangsters and other subjects that are only marginally related to the actual plot that they lose track of the need to tell a straightforward and compelling story.		Ironically, in No Place to Die, a serial killer tale I recently reviewed in these blogs, author James Thane tells a similar story  his murderer draws his motive from events that occurred far in the past and has worked out his crimes carefully. He even has a redoubt like Falks slaughterhouse where he takes one of the people he intends to kill.		But Thane minimizes the cardboard cutout figures in his cast of characters and works to make his serial killer as believable as the woman he kidnaps and holds hostage or the detective who is trying to capture him.  This not only makes the tension between the main characters more credible, but allows him to toggle the narrative between them, which is a good way to distract the reader from logical inconsistencies in their behavior.		The conspiracy theory that underlies the plot in Private Berlin -- and the numerous subplots, all red herrings inserted in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the storys mystery alive  simply clutter the novel and make the story less straightforward and compelling. The result is a novel that seems to waste its exotic locale and full-throttle opening.		If this is the best that Patterson can do, Ill be avoiding his stuff in the future.
1,Sorry, but I must have missed the point on this book. I kept waiting for a puppet to jump in and yell "America! F*&k Yeah! I found the characters type cast and stereo typical. I liked the premise of the book and was at home with the story itself. But all the 'sleek' good guys and 'dastardly' baddies took to much away from the enjoyment.  I don't like knocking anyone who has the guts to write a book and maybe being an Aussie I missed the patriotic angle.
1,I could not finish this book and I only persisted that far because I hoped it would get better. In vain. The cops are unbelievable. They are just angels, a fierce feminist, a black, a Muslim, a fat divorced guy, a shy nerd - and all extremely hard-working, polite, supportive and make only honest mistakes for which apologise and amend. And a new sergeant was homophobic when just arrived but after a 5 minutes heart-to-heart conversation with DI Ted Darling changed completely. And the gay boss has great relationship, cats, not a drinker, 4 black belts and exercises regularly. Ah, and he makes sure everyone gets their share of praise, motivates his team and leads by example. Honestly, even Soviet children books didn't portrait Lenin in such pink colours! Characters lack depth and look too unreal, too made up. I almost could see the author constructing the team and the characters to look "original".
1,It was okay.  The plot line and background information was good, but it wasn't a smooth, enticing read.  I could put it down and walk away and it didn't draw me back until I finished, like most books do.
1,A complete whitewash. Harmon was the only crew member to survive the South American crash. My uncle, a 1943 USMA grad, and fighter pilot in the Pacific,  told me years later that Harmon was silenced by the other pilots in his squadron for failure to stick with the plane and give the crew a chance to bail out. The pilot was supposed to be the last man out. It pays to be a football Hero!
1,I love James Patterson, I really do.  He has great talent with his writing and his way with both suspense and being able to pull you in with the first few chapters.  But lets be honest, this novel is indeed a step backwards from how the series started off with the first novel.  It has useless subplots, even the main one feels useless, and the ending completely feels out of place.  The murder of Jack Morgan's ex-girlfriend was a huge shock, but it led to nothing.  Even the revelation of who murdered her and who hired the killer to do it doesn't make any sense, let alone the fact that Patterson doesn't even really reveal anything on it.  I swear, I feel like he doesn't know how to end some of his books because he ends up creating a great story but has no idea on how to go with it or end it.  I do like the characters though, I enjoy reading them.  But lets face it, even with interesting characters and good writing to keep you interested, this novel is what it is.  Another thing I want to add, what is up with the "on-and-off relationship" between Jack and Justine?  Seriously!  I'm not interested in that.  I was more interested in Jack and Molleen from the first novel.
1,I had actually purchased the fifth book in the Outlander series on audiobook well over a year ago....and have yet to finish it. When the series showed up on TV, I didn't realize they went together. While the premise is interesting and laden with potential, I found the story line often bogged down or outright stalled with wordy, teenage typical romantic encounters that were just not believable for the circumstances or the ages of the characters. I believe the only hair-growing surface of Jamie's body that the sun didn't glisten off of at least one time was his toes! Like a number of other commentators, I had to take a break from the inaction for some more tightly written stories.		On reflection, my expectations were just too high. After reading scores of rave reviews, I was definitely hoping for something more. Now that I'm over the initial disappointment, I'm prepared to settle in and endure the next book in the series such as it is.		If, like myself, you are curious what all the fuss is about, go ahead and read Outlander. If you can overlook the subpar writing, the spastic pace, and the schizophrenic plotting, you might find Outlander at least occasionally entertaining. Isn't that a major reason to read? You'll be far happier with this book if you leave it at that. Just don't ask yourself if that's enough.
1,Was okay
1,Did not like any of the characters, including the protagonist.  Did not finish book.
1,I really tried to get into this book. There were so many punctuation, grammatical, and spelling errors - it was distracting. I thought that the author over described, it was so wordy in parts I would just skip whole paragraphs. And finally, I felt like every character was under developed, I didn't really like, love, hate, any character. The American characters spoke the same way the Londers did. I won't be reading the series and won't recommend.
1,I started this book with an open mind.  I was surprised to see it was written poorly, like a childrens' book.  I also was surprised that it made no sense whatsoever.  This just reinforced my belief that all organized religion is based on fairy tales.  Logical thinking would lead us to believe "God isn't fair" because there is no god, and life is random.  Nobody has the internal fortitude to deal with that.  Instead of admitting we don't know if god exists or not, we come up with circular, nonsensical arguments to reinforce our false sense of security that "god does everything for a reason."  It is time for the human race to grow out of childhood and face facts.  Unfortunately, that is not going to happen in our lifetime.
1,The book starts really well.		After being brutally beaten by an Earl, and while he's attempting to rape our heroine, she stabs him twice and manages to escape. Although severely injured she manages to ride for days without food or water, when her horse throws her, she is rescued by Duncan and members of his clan.		In chapter 10 they finally reach the clans castle, we learn immediately that the chiefs wife recognizes our heroine, but we can't learn the secret until the chief returns.		From the middle of chapter 10 almost through the end of the book, all we really hear is: Heroine "i'm plain and ugly, my step dad and step brothers told me so" and from everyone else "you are a bonny lass" BORING...BORING...BORING		I recommend skipping to chapter 19, this is when our Hero FINALLY kisses heroine and asks if he can "court" her. In chapter 20 we learn the Earl didn't die and the English are searching for heroine.		In Chapter 23 (there are 29 chapters) the chief returns and we FINALLY learn the "secret", Chapters 23 - 29 are actually really good.		I will say that when this couple finally had their actual "love" scene, I yawned!		Will I read this one again? NEVER
1,I was expecting pure magic to flow from every page given all that I'd heard about this book but was really disappointed.  It was too metaphorical and without any real punch to it. Also way too heavy and depressing for an end of day read.
1,If you expect a typical Peabody book forget it. I don't know when I've been so disappointed. I made it to page 37 before I gave up. The characters are broadly sketched versions of themselves, and as far as I got, their behavior is almost silly .. for example Emerson jumping on everyone who approaches him and Amelia, and fighting them to the ground .. except a pregnant female but only because Amelia was able to stop him in time. (Emerson attack a woman?) I hate writing negative reviews, so I'll stop here. If a book can't capture me by page 37 it's not worth my time. All I can say is don't waste your money on this book unless you absolutely have to complete your set of Peter's books. I have all of them as well as the Barbara Rosenblat audio versions (fantastic!) that I listen to in the car. But The Painted Queen is a great disappointment. I'm putting my copy up on eBay immediately.
1,Storyline and plot are weak and did not hold my interest enough to wade through more than a third of the book.
1,Very disappointing book.  The subject should have had a better author.  The book was so boring I never finished it.
1,This was NOT my thing.  Anything as hokey as DEMONS or half-demons was not the novel I wanted to read.  At 9% of the kindle story I deleted it.
1,you can find the same info on line for free,
1,She cheated, she's engaged and leave a bar with a man she doesn't know and sleeps with him. The next morning she wakes up and not once is the fact that she's engaged mentioned. Her gf bring clothes and doesn't mention it either. I had to go back and re read the beginning to make sure it was the same woman, I thought for sure it was someone else that was engaged. No "omg what have I done" no "I'm a horrible unfaithful person" Just all about the man she slept with. Best case scenario this is unrealistic, worst case scenario people have become completely comfortable with screwing around. I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination but no possible way could I connect with this character.
1,From Hell's heart, I stab at thee; For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee.
1,not her best...
1,The author descibes memories a lot more than she describes the actual walk she was doing which I found disappointing. Everything she saw or ate or said seemed to remind her of something else.
1,I love Stephen King books and I've been reading them for decades.  This one was a disappointment. The stories lacked suspense and I kept hoping that one of them would be somewhat exciting. Thus the disappointment.
1,Who are we kidding here, we're trying to avoid the Elephant in the room, which is proof...every word but the word 'pictures' is used to describe or suggest there is proof.  Ha..,where are there at the very least, some of those pics all over YouTube?  This is one category of research where a picture is worth much much more than 1000 words.  Regarding something like this, there is no substitute for pictures.
1,I found this biography to be great for history scholars but not very interesting for the average history buff.  I got it because another reviewer said it read like a novel.  I did not find that to be true.
1,Don't remember it. Am getting old!
1,For the price ($5.50) I was expecting a high quality note book.  The covers are thin for the price and they are rather small.  You can buy similar quality for a lot less.
1,The book just doesn't make sense to us.  Why are the friends only at the very end? It's like the message about working together with your friends was an after thought.  Lola is much better done in this respect (although the rhymes don't always work with american english).
1,The Heroine: Noelle. One of the most annoying/undeserving heroines I have ever read.	The Hero: Hector. Not bad, potential, if falling for Noelle didn't make him stupid.	Just didn't get why he would fall for her!		The whole book is about Noelle acting like a spoiled brat and an airhead, and then being mad at the whole world for thinking she is a spoiled brat and an air head. They should just KNOW that she is not and ignore all of her extremely selfish behavior.  Hector deserved better.  I started skipping large chunks of the book just to finish it.  I just don't get it.  A trauma for Noelle as a child was thrown in to make her look simpathetic, it really didn't.  The sad part was it was written like a writers note to self - Pause "implant convenient excuse for bad behavior and judgement here for Noelle."		I liked three of the Alien Huntress Books -Jaxon/Mishka's (my fav)- Eden/Lucius, Devin/Bride. I stronly dislike Mia, Ava and Noelle, I am sorry they are in the just too annoying to care category for me.  Hoping the leading lady of the book gets killed off and very soon is not a shinning example of a good read for me.		A very one dimensional and half hearted non love story.
1,If anyone wondered where the publishers are from, hearing this book ought to put it to rest. Why a Minnesota cop book needs to be read with a new Jersey accent is beyond me.  It makes the whole book feel like a mob story.  Ferrone is actually a good reader, with some decent voice inflections, but it destroys the story and is very distracting to have the heavy accent.  Of course, the publishers probably think nothing of this oversight, or maybe they did it on purpose to try to play to a broader audience.  Serious mistake.  I will not be getting anymore penguin audiobooks after this. Minnesota just isn't cool enough I guess, they have to bring in a little Joyzie.
1,I found the price tag to be a little steep for this. When I was a kid, we went swimming and my mom told me, "Watch out for huge ships. I mean really keep your eyes open, okay?". I've used that method to avoid huge ships ever since, and I've yet to be surprised while water sporting. It even works on smaller ships, canoes, and driftwood. So I kinda feel like this book is overpriced, considering my mom's advice about has it covered.
1,A self-indulgent train of thought kind of a rant. The wife's comments are the only good part, and those are far and few.
1,I kept reading this book until I got to chapter 7 and nothing of any consequence had happened.  I kept thinking it's gotta get better, but it didn't.  I just returned it for a refund thank god.  Don't bother.
1,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It's not funny,quite boring if you ask me! I hated this book more then getting a root canal
1,This book is dreadful. It's easily the worst in this series. It's definitely not a hard boiled novel.		But someone please correct me. How can there be a Starbucks in Denver in 1980?
1,I liked that this story hits on the fact that there will be massive die offs in the first months after society collapses. I also really like that the main character is cautious but willing to partner up with other survivors.		That being said, the format used to write the characters dialogue is very jarring and difficult to get caught up in. The biggest issue I had though was from there being too many aspects that were just outside my ability to believe. A twelve year old girl who looks 20. Gang members taking down a national guard unit, but then leaving valuable supplies unsecured. A wild rabbit sitting calmly in a humans lap 2 weeks after being caught and put into a pen.
1,Honestly, I couldn't even finish reading the whole thing.  30+ chapters of the same, repetitive whining and hideous faux "angst" over a big NOTHING.  I feel like there was literally NO plot.  It was this hideous "ground hog day" of faux fears every stinking chapter. Hashed to DEATH and finally resolved with the lamest sex EVER, just to start the WHOLE thing ALL OVER AGAIN in the next chapter.  AND the next chapter....AND the next chapter...AND the next chapter.....HOLY CRAP.  UGH.		And the biggest irony of it all is that he kept calling her the "bravest, most strong woman I've ever met..." when she was probably the most fear-driven, whiney, WEAK woman I've EVER read in a story.		There were a couple of decent books in this series, but the originality is DEFINITELY sucked dry by book 3.  Any more than that and the author needs to move on and let it go.
1,I had to force myself to read this because it was a book club choice. It was too drawn out. I do not mind long stories, but this was easier to put down than to turn the next page.
1,I really enjoyed the Broken trilogy from this author, so I thought for sure I'd love this, too. Unfortunately I just couldn't get into it. I think it was more of a disconnect than anything else. There's nothing wrong with the novel, it just wasn't for me :/
1,meh
1,I hate to say avoid this book but I must.  I was very intrigued when starting this novel.  The story line seemed very interesting and I had read the many comments here about the child abuse aspect and knew I would be alright with it as long as it was handled well.  I was looking forward to a mature, intelligent read.  Seemed like Lisa Gardner might have been trying to step it up to another level.		Boy, was I disappointed.  Lisa Gardner is totally out of her league here.  She does attempt a character driven psychological suspense thriller and instead produces a disjointed lackluster poorly written old school try.  The story is told from many different character's point of view and travels over different story lines.  If done well, this can be very exciting and only add to the intrigue for the reader.  Instead you have to remember what the cjharacter was last doing when they were last in the story and it gets confusing as to what is past and present.  The child abuse aspect did not bother me but it was out of place with the rest of the novel.  Those scenes belonged in a deeper, much more detailed novel.		I also had a problem with our main character Kimberly Quincy.  She is pregnant here and her relationship with her husband is a big part of the book but the way they interact doesn't always make sense.  The book does wrap itself up adequately but I did not enjoy the journey to get there.  For a much more intelligent, psychological thriller I recommend Lisa Unger's Black Out.
1,There was some decent content in this book, but I think the rave reviews are a reaction to the author more than to the book itself. The book is only okay. While certainly readable, I didn't find the sense of organization that impressive, nor did I perceive a clear, specific plan of action for the reader to take away. One has to cull various ideas from throughout.  That's not the end of the world, but it detracts from the reader's ability to take immediate, meaningful career action after reading.		Annoyingly, some places feel more like convenient opportunities for Sandberg to show off her close relationships with big names - more a "look how cool I am" display of unnecessary details than truly relevant information the reader can use.  If I wanted to hear about Sergey Brin doing yoga in his office I'd read articles about Brin, but I frankly don't care, and I am certainly not interested in getting this kind of extraneous detail from a book about WOMEN in the workplace.		I also think Sandberg flat-out missed the mark in some places. She describes a mentor in a way that really is more accurately reflective of what a sponsor is, and appears to have had a snide reaction to a woman leaving the company after feeling she didn't have a mentor. I could almost see Sandberg rolling her eyes and looking down on this woman for her description of what she thought was missing in the support she needed. While what the woman described might not be exactly what a mentor is either, she did describe an adviser role that is just as important a support for women, particularly early in their careers. Sandberg's assessment that this woman was really looking for a therapist therefor comes across as mean-girlish and professionally immature.		In summary, it doesn't hurt to read this book if it's one of many career books you pick up, but it's not even on the list of books I recommend to mentees, peers, or friends. If you're not a big reader and are likely to get through only a small number of professional books, don't make this one of them at the expense of better ones. I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/She-Wins-You-Win-The-Most-Important-Strategies-for-Making-Women-More-Powerful/dp/1592400590/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">She Wins, You Win: The Most Important Strategies for Making Women More Powerful</a>.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Expect-to-Win-10-Proven-Strategies-for-Thriving-in-the-Workplace/dp/0452295904/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Expect to Win: 10 Proven Strategies for Thriving in the Workplace</a>&nbsp;is also good. If you're only going to read one book, you'd be far better off with either of those than with Lean In.
1,Im sorry, I found parts of this series entertaining. I found most of it to be utterly rediculous. And now 30% into this novel I've had all the stupidity I can take. This is the true gutter trash of sci-fi. I can not believe I invested this much time into something so poorly written. I'll admit in just not the type to push the I believe button.  I need some realism when it comes to a story. Not a lot, I'd never of gotten this far if I needed a lot.  But the story gets even more rediculous in this one, and there is only so much I can take. I'll never know how it turns out.....I burned the book and proverbially pissed on the ashes.
1,Concept of story is not bad. It tried to have some plot twists surprises but failed. The writing is not that smooth and story felt contrived, with characters that felt over the top. Not the best prophecy story to read.
1,Did not care for this book at all.  It did not give information as to helping memory.
1,I'm a male who read this book because of it's provocative title and because Joan Rivers can be pretty funny.  In essence, it's a guide to cosmetic surgery with some pretty lame jokes strewn in between. If the topic is of interest to you, it could be helpful as a rough guide or starting point.
1,I enjoy Lisa Gardner's books but her publisher charging full price for the Kindle book, more than the paperback costs at places like Walmart, is obscene. No printing, no distribution, no returned book costs.  And if you think about it, you are really only renting the book.  Unlike the paper book, you cannot lend it to others, resell it, donate it to a library, etc. Lisa's Web site invites fans to write to her; I did about this issue, but she never responded. This is not an Amazon problem.  The major book publishers decided to force eBook prices higher.  They are now setting the Kindle book prices, not Amazon. I encourage others not to buy a Kindle version unless it is priced significantly less than the paperback or hardback price.
1,Please save your money. Total pap. This book  is full of moronic propaganda. Recommended perhaps for cleaning your shoes of dog excrement.
1,It was an interesting read but not super exciting. If made into a movie would be considered slow.
1,I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm.  So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book.  I was less than impressed.  I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story.		This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.		Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was "Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"  I think not.
1,This book just explains what to do during the mass but does do the step by step prayers and rituals. I just tells you when to stand or kneel. I wanted to have the guide with the new responses. Total waste of my money. If you do not already know what to say and do this book is completely useless. This is not for someone who is green in catholicism.
1,This book is so obviously thrown together -- and so badly written -- as to be laughable. Actually laughable: I tried to listened to it as an audiobook and found myself giggling in the car, despite the horridness of the crime. This guy's prose is that bad, plus he does amateur stuff like splicing in dopey quotations about the criminals' personalities from their relatives and friends at random moments.	Where's an editor when you need one?
1,This book is full of episodes that not only stretch the imagination, but really tax it. How does a totally unskilled attorney survive a night in the snow evading trained (?) Wolves and then suddenly come out of the freezing cold to, along with his sixteen year old cystic fibrosis (CD) daughter kill five killers? And how many kids with CD grow to be taller than their mothers?  There are many more, but that's the gist of it.  Give me a break!
1,This book was idiotic and could have been written by a 5th grader. The only good thing was that it was free on kindle unlimited.
1,I signed up to review a The Essential Bible Companion to the Psalms from Zondervan, who provided me with a copy at no cost to me. The book released last year, and seeks to be a counterpart to a reader's Bible when reading and studying the Psalms.		The book is in two main sections. Firstly is the introductory material, which offers insight into the structure, purpose and practical use of the Psalms in their original historical, cultural and geographical contexts. After this follows a page-per-Psalm companion piece. Each page features information on genre, purpose, content, some reflective thoughts and questions, and a graphic to help highlight the tone and meaning of the Psalm.		The book is colorful, and quite nicely formatted. The question I have is how essential this companion is to the average reader. In reading through I found myself consistently reminded of a high school textbook. That is no bad thing if the student is young, but to be honest most of the information contained is either evident to a careful reader of the original text or is already contained in a good study bible and so I could not help but feel that "essential" was too strong an adjective for this basic volume.		If you are looking for a resource to aid in studying the Psalms with your children, this may be just the ticket, but otherwise it may disappoint.
1,I really did try to like this book but never got into it;  Anyone want me copy? I would like to know why I failed to respond.
1,The first 100 pages of this book are entertaining. He writes in a way that keeps you interested up to a point. I am an avid reader and this book took me many months to finish. I didn't even want to finish it but always feel compelled to do so. History repeats itself and after so many chapters of war I just didn't care anymore. After reading this book I felt that desiring peace in a time of war is hardly possible. Looking back over our history made this clear-humans, power, and violence go hand in hand.
1,This book provides a rudimentary knowledge of the religion and impact religions have had on the Native American people's since the 1500s. Although the book has some well written sections, such as that on the peyote religion- the majority of the book was disorganized and poorly written. Often choppy, the book lacked structure- and even though it is a short novel- it's often wordy in some parts, and lacking details in others. I would not waste even $1 on this book, unless it is a required reading for school, like it was for me.
1,boring!
1,I bought this book and "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Electronics 101" at the same time. In spite of having read and understood the other book, I found that getting through Electronics for Dummies was a struggle. The layout is confusing on the page and the author's attempts at humour get tired very quickly. When you're trying to learn a concept and get stuck, the last thing you want is some poor joke included. In addition, unlike the other book, there are no examples of how each component might be utilised in a real circuit within the chapters. You have to head towards the back of the book to find projects. I find this a weakness of this book whereas the other book does well to immediately reinforce the concepts described. I would recommend people pass on this book unless they require gentle humour to make a technical book readable.
1,Much of this book is tedious.  I used to rank Patricia Cornwell among my favorite authors, but the last few books have been slow and repetitive.  This one is no exception, so tedious that the plot is nearly lost. It does get better in the second half, though.  Cornwell uses an odd combination of present tense and third person omniscient.  She  frequently uses "and" to tie together otherwise separate sentences.  I think the idea is to mimic stream of consciousness, but instead it just seems like poor grammar.  The style is disconcerting and detracts from the plot.  The plot itself is fairly preposterous - too many unlikely scenarios and connections.  The two books before Trace were also both blah and painful to read (I didn't bother to finish either one).  I wish she would pick up the action of her earlier style!
1,information in side should have been sent for free with two other storey book purchases would not reccomend this  to others
1,They obviously never get tired of it. The umpteenth book with the same legends copied from all the other conspiracy theorists - I guess Bossie wanted to have his share of the bucks. That's understandable. The sad thing is not the illectual disingenuity of Bossie, Coulter, Morris & co. Sad are all these people who'll buy this wish-wash. Not recognizing that they now own about seventy versions of the same book.
1,The content of the book is fine, but the book itself is not in good condition. Many of the pages are spotted with mold. While I usually keep all Sharon McCrumb books , I will hesitate to put this on my shelf for fear that the mold will spread to other books.
1,The URANTIA Book (UB) is a 2097-page, 1.25 million-word compilation of several papers allegedly authored by a group of "divine revelators" claiming to representatives of God's vast celestial hierarchy.  These "ghostwriters" (pun intended) were commissioned by their heavenly "supervisors" to enlighten the human inhabitants of this planet (which they call Urantia) as to how mankind has been supposedly misled throughout human history by the errors of religious thinking.  The primary target for which the UB "authors" claim is in need of "correction" in the arena of religion is the Bible, with all its misconceptions regarding the nature of God, who Jesus was, etc. Thanks in part to what the famous skeptic Martin Gardner points out in his book entitled URANTIA: The Great Cult Mystery, I find it difficult to accept the truth-claims that these alleged celestial authors present, in light of several factors.  To begin with, Gardner takes exception to the many scientific errors within the pages of the UB. Much of the UB's vast science content has been rendered outdated because of discoveries made since (and in some cases prior to) its publication in 1955.  Some of the scientific data, however, is outright erroneous to begin with (such as the surface temperature of the sun and the number of chromosomes in a human cell).  These alleged higher minds of the heavenly host attempt to excuse the outdated science by evoking a "prime directive," supposedly handed down by their celestial superiors, which admonishes them not to reveal any unearned science to us evolving mortals and to present their scientific treatises within the limits of our then-current vernacular. However, this excuse does not bode well because at the same time these intergalactic messengers are bedazzling us with their brilliance as pertains to things known, they also baffle us with a fantastic model of the universe that is beyond our wildest dreams and which is, of course, unearned science.  Ample more compelling evidence is provided by Gardner that suggests the UB was the brainchild not of celestials, but of mere terrestrials.  The all-too-human concept of racism and a blatant promotion of eugenics are given full endorsement by the "divine revelators." Furthermore, many revealing cases of plagiarism on the part of the visiting spirits are cited.  But what tips the scale of human invention is the weight of Seventh Day Adventist influence to be found in the UB.  The angelic authors wholeheartedly adopt such 7DA doctrines as soul-sleep, the annihilation of the wicked, the denial of the existence of hell, and that Jesus Christ is (the archangel) Michael.  (The UB prescribes a variation on this Adventist theme in that Jesus is just one of several hundred thousand Sons of God throughout the vastly populated universe, born prior to his human incarnation into the celestial aristocratic order of Michaels.  He surreptitiously died on the cross at the hands of evil men not to atone for your sins, but to cap his own career as celestial sovereign to our little corner of the universe.)  But just because these similarities exist between the UB and a "Christian" sect does not mean that the UB and the Bible are compatible with one another.  If the reader is endowed with even a basic knowledge of the Bible, then many particular contrasts will stand out clearly when comparing notes.  In exchange for bestowing divinity upon the would-be believer, the UB vehemently denies all major historic Christian doctrines including the Atonement, Virgin Birth, bodily resurrection, and Deity of Christ.  And this is not all that is to be gleaned from the UB papers regarding Christianity. These are but a few of the observations that a discerning Christian will make when comparing the UB with the Bible.  The UB author(s): 1) Claim that the Old Testament represents the evolved religion of a superstitious desert clan; 2) Rewrite the four Gospels to fit their own preconceived agenda; 3) Write up a history of Jesus' years as a youth and young adult, again agenda-driven; 4) Disparage Paul as having influenced Christianity by injecting Hellenism and Paganism; 5) State that Jesus was not the Messiah, nor did He claim to be; and the list goes on and on.  Speaking of the apostle Paul, how easy it seems for these resplendent revisionists to lop off nearly two thirds of the New Testament by declaring his works irrelevant.  Could there be a motive behind their redactory method?  I will quote just one Bible verse in this review, written by Paul nearly two thousand years ago (which the divine revelators no doubt would prefer that it be ignored), and let the reader decide whether or not the shoe fits:	 "But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed." (Galatians 1:8)	 Why does the UB attract so many faithful adherents, despite its questionable trustworthiness?  The answer is simple; because the UB makes elegant use of (quite literally) the oldest trick in the book.  It strokes the reader's ego by telling the would-be believer what he or she wants to hear (2Tim. 4:2,3); that despite their occasional tendency to "err," they have within them a divine agent that renders them Godlike.  This same pretty package has been rewrapped countless times and continues to be offered today in the guise of the New Age movement.  You can read about the first time this ploy was used (and its rather successful results) in the Bible (Gen. 3:5 et seq.).
1,Was so disappointed with this book. It held SO much promise such as the perfect subject matter that hits on many levels such as revenge, betrayal, and humor. However, the raunchiness got in the way of everything that would make the storyline interesting. It only alludes too the mother and ex-boyfriend's suffering from their betrayal. Sorry, but there is no way to justify a mother sleeping with her daughter's boyfriend. We needed to see that mother suffer. However, we see the mother justifying what she does. Instead of seeing that mother really suffer and have to take a hard look in the mirror, we see pages of sex, raunchy talk, sex, arrogant characters, sex, making excuses, sex, justifying bad choices, sex .... did I say sex?	And yes, the boyfriend was a jerk caving in to the mom's seductions, but he used his girlfriend to have access to her famous mother. Why? Mommy Dearest was leverage. She could get him a career boost. Why did we not get to see his suffering and/or heart wrenching remorse when he FINALLY realized he threw away the most precious thing in his life?	I just really expected more content... real content, in this book. Instead we are overloaded with explicit sex scenes and cocky potty mouths. I ended up skipping over all those pages, which made this a very quick read since real content was pretty much nonexistent.
1,The comic book plot could have worked if the author was able to properly use adult English. The repeated improper choice of words made it seem like I was reading a grammar school product. I wish the author had bothered to get an editor and research support. Even most comic books keep more in touch with reality.	Do not waste your time with this book.
1,I think this will be the last Heinlein story I buy. This one is just like Stranger in a Strange Land: half the pages are spent describing Heinlein's ideal for sexual relationships. In both stories the lead male has an other-wordly trait that women - all women - want passed down through their own children. So women are doing everything they can think of to get the male lead into bed: begging, pouting, cajoling, even trying to explain why it's the logical thing to do. In this story the male lead beds his own mother, as well as his twin sisters - when they are just barely legal - among many others. It's just too much of the same thing. Heinlein must have had a rich fantasy life and rosy palms.
1,I don't like or care about any of the characters. All emotional attempts seem contrived and two dimensional. And, man!  Does this guy go on and on in a droning discursive way. The magical part might be fun or intriguing but there so little there. The espionage details (very detailed) might be fascinating to wonks but not to the typical brainy sf reader.  I just don't get the appeal. I read one other book of his, that was better but again characters are charmless.
1,didn't really like it enough to finish
1,This product is expensive!  Is it worth it?		I have been teaching Spanish and French in local nursery schools & daycares in NJ for eight years. It is great to encourage parents to teach their little ones. Some excellent product series have appeared in the last four years: the Ana Lomba books & tapes, the Professor Toto DVD's, the Language Tree French/Spanish for Kids DVD's, Whistlefritz' "Los Animales" and SpanishPlaytime's "Muevete" (last 2 Sp. only).		This workbook/CD is inappropriate for ages 3-5, who need gross-motor activity, music, color, big tactile props. You can do far better for same or better price with items mentioned above, or even old tried-and-true song-&-picture series like Barbara MacArthur's (Sing/Dance/Eat Quiche/Tacos) or Judy Mahoney's (Teach Me French/ Spanish).

1,The Assignments were to read the book every week. after the second week we didn't touch the book, rather we told about how terrible awful things humans are and we're not worthy of the earth's love. And the professor rained down on us how important she was for discovering a new strain of rock slime, and how monsanto is an awful company that's killing people with its products (that part's true) At least I got something out of the course.
1,This checklist is at least two years old and have not updated its contents. Despite saying it will be updated as new books come out.
1,Poorly written with unclear examples.  Massively redundant throughout, seemingly follows the idea that repetition of the same poor explanation will help you understand better.  Material is complex enough without introducing unnecessary decipherability challenges.		If you have another option, take that option.  If not, supplement (or supplant) with another book or online resources.
1,I have read and enjoyed all of the Jesse Stone novels, either by Mr. Coleman or Mr. Parker, so I was quite disappointed when I picked this one up.	Stone novels are supposed to be spare and laconic, like Jesse himself. Instead, I think this one is quite overwritten.		I will wait for the next installation, perhaps when Reed puts down the thesaurus.
1,I'm giving this book a low score because .....I really hate it when the author ends the story right in the middle  of an interesting turn of events.  I am wondering.....did she do this just so we would run out and but the next book to see how it ends? Sorry I don't think I will because, like I said, I dislike when authors do that.  However the story line was good up to that point and the characters were very likable.
1,I love Nesbo. I hated this book. I felt badly manipulated to no purpose when it was over.
1,Some of the storylines are half-acceptable if you can get past the barrage of bad grammar and poorly formed sentences. For the life of me I do not understand why someone would write children's stories that use bad grammar and teach improper English. What is the point of that? Do 6-9 yr old kids speak this way? No, they do not, or at least they should be taught not to. Not to mention the behavior that is being taught... Does the author speak this way? Does her children speak and behave this way? I hope not. I feel sorry for the parents who think these are nice books and that they describe acceptable behavior.	Please do yourself (and your child) a big favor and look elsewhere for prose. There are countless wonderful books out there. Good luck.
1,It was OK it left me with several questions and the epilogue  was not one of my favorites. I love Gwyneth Bolton books but this o e is lacking.
1,I felt I wasted my time and money on this book. The author ends his  book with such non-conformist ideas as: "Students could revolt and change universities...Grading could be abolished or modified..."; Communities could abolish 98 percent of homelessness by allocating enough space for "tent cities" and free shelter for up to one year; Prisons for non-violent offenders could be "open"centers where the occupants check in every day before going to a supervised job..".  Universities with no grades, tent cities and open center prisons may be creative non-conformist options but not ones I agree with. This book offered me little in the way of valuable and unique information.
1,If you need pictures like me to see what you cook should like like, don't waste your money on this book.	I was very disappointed.  I purchased it for my husband, he took one look and said he would never use because he couldn't see what the end result should look like.
1,Poorly written, tedious first-person, teen-angsty, purple prose renders this book unreadable. Pepper Winters does not understand BSDM techiques and promotes idiotic sexual practices that guarantees a trip to the ER. Further Winters racks up too many stock romance cliches from good girls doing bad things for a sick relative (her daughter) to stone cold killer redeemed by the love of a "good" woman. No relationships are developed, and Zel keeps returning to an abusive man because she can't seem to control her lust and masochistic tendencies. I have read better written stories for free on Wattpad. These dark romance writers don't understand how to construct and execute an erotic story that deals with taboo subjects. It's depressing that stories like these are selling and destroying the BDSM erotica genre.
1,First let me start off by saying I loved&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Band-of-Brothers-E-Company-506th-Regiment-101st-Airborne-from-Normandy-to-Hitler-s-Eagle-s-Nest/dp/074322454X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest</a>, also by Ambrose. I liked how Pegasus Bridge starts out and was getting the feeling this would be another great book. However, I found Ambrose's telling of the battle for Pegasus Bridge quite anticlimactic. The fight to take the bridge is over before it begins. Ambrose talks about fighting occurring frequently in defense of the bridge, but rarely provides details. More often than not the anecdotes provide more comic relief than a compelling story. The exception is Sergeant Thornton taking out the tank to halt an early German counterattack. Soon after this Company D goes into reserve while the 7th Battalion takes over the defense. Even when some of Company D troops go into the front no details are provided. I was expecting a lot more detail from a book that is purported to be about a single two day battle. The impression that I get from reading Ambrose's account is that taking the bridge was easy and, other than the one perfect shot by Sergeant Thornton, Company D is relieved by the 7th Battalion before all the real fighting gets started.		After Company D leaves the bridge to rejoin its regiment, the story goes downhill. This part of the story seems detached and aimless. I think Ambrose would have been better served concentrating more on the fight at the bridges and enlarging his scope to provide more coverage of the 7th Battalion defense against the counterattacks. The Battle for Pegasus Bridge shouldn't be just a story of Company D. Ambrose really relies on too few sources to make the story complete. If he wanted to write a company history he should have changed the title.		What I really did not enjoy was several references to Company D men being irritated by being put back into the line after they were initially relieved at the bridge. Especially when they were being asked to come up and support 7th Battalion paratroopers, who were getting hit with the full face of the counterattack. Again later Ambrose tells us they felt they should be returned back to England for refitting and preparing for the next bridge assault instead of fighting with the rest of the troops. I'm sure the other troops in the line wouldn't have felt much sympathy for them. Another part that should have been scratched was the suggestion that there not being a coup de main assault in Operation Market Garden because D company was not available to do it. Simply ridiculous. Ambrose makes it seem that D Company was the only highly trained unit in the British airborne. I hope Ambrose has embellished the story on his own or taken these parts out of context.		But, it isn't all bad. Pegasus Bridge is still an easy read with many amusing anecdotes and you will gain an understanding of what occurred at Pegasus Bridge and why it was successful. He does provide some accounts from German sources which add tremendously to the story. The book does contain a good sketch showing the area around the bridges and several good photographs. It also includes Major Howard's actual orders. Some details about the amazing accuracy of the British intelligence are provided. Perhaps they should have given some pointers to their American colleagues who didn't even know until D-Day that the 352nd division had been moved up to the coast near Omaha three month before the invasion. Overall I would not recommend this book. I found Pegasus Bridge fails to deliver fully on its title and left me wondering where the rest was.
1,My review for "Down the Rabbit Hole" was actually for "Brotherhood in Death."  Sorry.  I've been dealing with a broken arm, which I discovered scattered my mental faculties.  In "Down the Rabbit Hold,"  I liked the "Dallas" one, but found several of the other stories tedious.  Lynne
1,unreadable trash.
1,If the demon is in the details, then James R. Hanson's "First Man" has slain every demon in sight.  The real tragedy is that after 648 pages, we're left with a comprehensive timeline of Neil Armstrong's life, but with little insight as to the inner workings of the man himself.		Indeed, as the commander of the Apollo 11 moon landing mission, crewed by the "amiable strangers" of Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, it was ironic that the closemouthed, enigmatic Armstrong was chosen to make he first step onto another planet.  Of the three, he proves to be the least interesting.  The ambitious Aldrin schemes and works the backchannels of NASA management, trying to be the first down the ladder, while the cheerful, irreverent Collins methodically goes about his business of flying the Command Module while his crewmates make the landing.  (Collins is also an author, and his "Carrying the Fire" is a much better account of the mission than Hanson provides here.)		Despite reams of information and hundreds of interviews, Hanson chooses to let Armstrong provide much of the commentary, which proves to be a mistake.  To the end, Armstrong remains the quintessential engineer, letting the data speak for itself, and offering only the most guarded of opinions.  It's clear that his fellow astronauts have opinions of their own, and when Hanson allows them to dish, the picture of Armstrong becomes more complex.  Indeed, the book would have been far more interesting with more colleague sound-bites and less Armstrong.		Throughout Armstrong's NASA career, his managers and finally Hanson himself use him as a movie screen to project their own visions of Mom, apple pie, and the dream of beating those lousy Commies to the moon.  They hold him up as the symbol of America they want him to be, rather than the engineering near-savant he seems to become, all but cut off from any emotions of his own. Armstrong's divorce from his wife of 35 years is brushed aside in three pages.  The fact that he supposedly didn't carry anything to the moon and back for his wife and kids is passed off in a remark.		One could be forgiven after reading this book for believing that there was no room in the space progam for colorful astronauts.  However, the careers of the late extroverted, noisy Pete Conrad (Two Gemini missions, Apollo 12 landing, and Skylab), or motormouthed "Captain America" Gene Cernan (Gemini, Apollo 17 commander) would indicate otherwise.		After the moon mission, it was Aldrin and Collins who took interesting steps of their own.  Collins wrote, worked in the State Department and later managed the opening of the wonderful Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  Aldrin, crushed by his "second guy on the moon" status, battled depression and alcoholism before emerging healthy and sober as a vocal advocate of our continued presence in space.		And Armstrong?  He became a near-recluse, but not before briefly becoming a professor of engineering at the University of Cincinnati, roughly the equivalent of Tiger Woods taking a job as the resident pro at a public golf course in Fargo.  Rather than boost the space program which afforded him a place in history (an achievement paid for by you and me), he refused to "pimp", opting instead to delve further into himself.		Through sheer volume of details, Hanson masks the fact that this hagiography is neither an enlightening nor satisfying look at the man who forever changed interplanetary travel.  Those old enough will always remember where they were the moment Armstrong set foot on the moon (and blew his line - it was supposed to be "one small step for A man..."), but you'll never discover the human being within the moonsuit from this weighty tome.
1,The series is good, great actually. But I can buy these kindle versions cheaper seperately, or pay half price for printed versions. It's over the top that the electronic format costs double the paperback version. A bundle should save money, it's the point of a bundle.
1,I quite reading it, not something I do very often.
1,As a Michael Crichton fan, I found this book disappointing. The fundamental ideas underlying the plot were good and Crichton takes pains to make the quantum concepts reasonably clear (though in simplifying them he skips over a lot of details that don't quite jell with his plot!). I also found the glimpses of feudal life in the middle ages to be fascinating. For all that however, the plot development never quite takes off and a very large number of situations in the novel seem to be contrived rather than flowing with the storyline. As other reviewers have commented, this is closer to a movie outline than a book and there are contradictions galore. Excusable perhaps from a new author but not from Crichton. Two stars for the initial idea, but that is all.
1,A great children's author (who, for the sake of her privacy, shall remain nameless) once commented that "The Rainbow Fish", was the third in the triumvirate of picture book mediocrity.  The first two being, of course, "Love You Forever" and "The Giving Tree".  I don't feel like explaining why this statement is not only brilliant but sublime, so instead I'm going to review this seemingly innocent little picture book.  Here we have a very dull book with a very poor message.  In my humble opinion, it hardly deserves much notice.		Originally a Swiss picture book (who knew?), "Rainbow Fish" tells the tale of a little sparkly fellow below the sea.  The Rainbow Fish glitters and glides in the ocean's depths, ignoring the calls of the other fish to come out and play.  One day a little fish asks for one of his shiny scales.  The Rainbow Fish is not exactly polite in his refusal, but for some reason this is the comment that causes all the other fish to make him a social pariah.  The Rainbow Fish is a little upset by this and asks the advice of a wise old octopus.  Unfortunately the octopus is of the opinion that Rainbow Fish should give away the very things that make him special.  His shiny scales.  Once he has given a scale to all the other fishes he'll look exactly like everyone else and be happy.  He does and then is.  The end.		I suppose if you looked at this book from a religious context it might make a little more sense.  But even then the moral would still run along the lines of give-up-your-worldly-possessions-and-everybody-will-like-you.  Hm.  What makes this book so offensive to some readers is the simple fact that it's is preaching a kind of same = good mentality.  Tis better to meld with the crowd than to hold onto that which makes you an individual and unique, it sayeth.  Then there are the illustrations to contend with.  In an interesting marketing technique, the shiny scales Rainbow Fish sports are small hologram-ish cut-outs that line his body.  Little kids will, presumably, see the shiny things on the cover of the book and immediately grab it.  But how stand the rest of the illustrations?  Certainly the colors in this tale are luminous and lovely.  Pfister has developed a lovely watercolor technique wherein the blended shades of the scenes work perfectly within the context of the story.  Unfortunately, the actual illustrations themselves are fairly hum drum.  Don't expect the breathtaking loveliness of Eric Carle's "Mister Seahorse" or even the originality of a similar seaside tale, Irene Haas's, "The Maggie B.".  Characters here never change expression (except that once in a while their little fishy mouths curl either up or down as appropriate).  As a gimmick, the shiny scales work well.  Just don't pay much attention to anything else in this tale.		The best advice I can give regarding "The Rainbow Fish" is to recommend Leo Lionni's classic picture book, "Swimmy".  Like The Rainbow Fish, Swimmy's a little guppy who's different from everyone else.  But rather than, oh say, changing his scale color to blend in, Swimmy uses his unique position in society to help those around him while remaining true to himself.  A powerful statement that "The Rainbow Fish" sorely lacks.  I'm not saying this is the worst picture book ever written, mind you.  Just a mediocre one.  With all the wonderful picture books out there, why not grab the best and leave the rest?  Or, if we're going to take the advice of the Rainbow Fish to heart, do what everyone else is doing and strive for mediocrity.  Hey, it worked for him!
1,I have always enjoyed Robin Cook and his ability to keep one engrossed as the plot thickens progressively.  Unfortunately, for "Foreign Body", I was pretty much convinced of exactly what was going to happen long before it did.  I continued through the book to see how things would develop but, as it turned out, there were no turns, no surprises. Hope his next one is more of a "Medical Thriller." Robin Cook always uses the English language beautifully in his descriptions, he is not simply a storyteller but a writer. Better plot and development next time, please.
1,A nice introduction but I would have liked to have seen the projects better demonstrated if this book is for beginners or further expanded if this is for more experienced crafters. Some good ideas but not really enough of anything to make it worth my time.  I found better material on upcycling websites.
1,The premise sounded wonderful but as the story developed the sex got too informative for me. Not a fan. I quit reading what might have been a good story.
1,Not a good book. I had to will myself into finishing it. If you are a Christian....move on to another book. Berry seems more interested in pumping false facts aimed at attacking Christian faith more than in writing a good book. The writing was poor and the plot unbelievable. I;ve read a few books from this series and liked them....but after this book I will NEVER read another Steve Berry book again.
1,Waiting to finish this short audio book was torturous.  Catherine Tauber narrates this story as if she were a bored 10th grader whose English teacher just called on her to read to the class.  Not helping her is the undeveloped, disjointed, oft-times cliche-ridden story that Jackson has written.  The story wasn't plausible, (a girl can't kill someone with one crack on the head with a bottle), her characters are as shallow as a papercut (Aunt Flo does nothing but scream, Burr's character is written as if he were a woman and Clarise is too sickening sweet).  Additionally, there is an entire chapter dedicated to car games that Burr and Arlene play on their trip to Alabama.		This isn't entertainment.  This isn't Southern literature at its best.  This is a quickie novel that Ms. Jackson probably penned in under two months and someone accidently green-lighted without a proper edit job.
1,Useless. Don't waste your money. Didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.
1,Sadly this book is pedestrian. Written by a committee of one. Characters as paper thin as Wilburs. Relieved only by the history. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in length.
1,I find it very hard to give only two stars to an author who so clearly loves the children she and her organization serve. It is her obvious dedication that has kept me from giving this only one star.		This slim book is a mishmash of statistics. with individual stories of children not much different from  the narration for one of those infomercials from many non-profits now on various cable stations. For anyone who has read even a little about the topic, there is little new in the numbers, and even more up-to-date references and data can be found by a quick web search. The disorganization and redundancy of both the data references and anecdotes was very distracting. One other concern: there are many other non-profits and Christian organizations involved in similar work, yet the book ignores this fact--one more way in which this resembles an advertisement for the organization rather than an overall picture of this global crisis.		Bottom line: if you want to support the AIDS Orphans Rising organization, do it by donating the cost of the book directly to the organization rather than buying a book of so little real value.
1,The first part of the book is good but it kind of get repetive after few chapters.  Did not finish it.
1,If I wanted a detective story, i'd have picked a detective story. This book turns into a genre I don't think many techo-thriller/adventure readers would enjoy. Since when did Harvath go to detective school? The character and his work with Boston P.D. et al. did not make any sense at all? It simply did not work for me because of Harvath's past experience and what he does, he's a SEAL for Pete's sake, a stone cold killer, and tactical operator....not Sherlock Holmes (which I do like, by the way). This is why Mr. Thor's previous novels work...there are people he works for and with who know better than him when conducting, planning and executing operations...and the Harvath character works within that system to great effect. Please do better in the next book?
1,This book was stupid in my opinion.  All it was about really was him making duplicates of himself and **spoilers** having orgies with his alternate selves.  I didn't even finish reading it.  It was awful.
1,Pretty nice but I wish it wasn't printed in China. I don't trust the paper or ink used. How do I know it isn't toxic. Won't buy again or recommend for that reason.
1,It has been many, many years since I read my last Nora Roberts romance. I recall them being sweet and fluffy and the hot sex scenes. Perhaps it's my maturity, the wide range of romance I've read since that time, or simply the new contemporary romance genre that has changed my perception of Roberts. This book was beyond boring; even the sex scenes barely got an interested eyebrow raise from me. The romance was practically non-existent, just a series of ill-timed sex scenes. The mystery was so dragged out that I gave up caring about halfway through the book. I couldn't wait for this to finish.		I listened to the audio version and I hated Gary Littman's narration. His pacing was slow and monotonous. His cadence suggested a noir book instead of a romance/mystery. And don't even get me started on the absolutely ridiculous female voices in this book. All of the voices were terrible, but especially the females'. Should have been read by a woman, even though the main protagonist was male.
1,India will be the World's largest Military Power after 2060 and this book ignores India. I can't believe it!		India currently has the World's 2nd largest army, 4th largest Air Force and the 5th Largest Navy.		Shame on you Friedman!		I urge all Indians to boycott this book.		By the way India has the World's 2nd largest English speaking population. If you ignore India, you will not go far especially if the book is written in English. Take my word for it!		Jai Hind!
1,I suppose some females would act this way, but it just went on wayyyy too long!  I liked the ending.
1,This poor woman made so many bad choices it boggles your mind.	Most of us wouldn't even consider a second date with a man that picked up his plate and licked off the remaining spaghetti sauce,at the introduction dinner at her mother's home. You can imagine how her mom tried to discourage that relationship.	He was crude,rude and gross and dishonest, yet Vicki not only continued dating him she went on to marry him! Vicki seemed like a good person, but not very discerning.	They adopted two little boys that were in need of parents and relatives of Seths. Vicki tried to be a good mom to them,but was so emotionally traumatized by her husband and miscarriages,she couldn't function normally.	Seth was arrested several times in a prostitution sting. Had an affair with Mary Jean,who was just as crude, rude, greedy and dishonest as he was.	Vicki made several suicide attempts while separated and in a custody battle. She lost custody of her baby and the older boys,even though the baby had obvious signs of abuse on his little body after his time with his father. All the kids should have been removed from these crazy people!	Mary Jean helped harass Vicki by putting a pipe bomb in Vicki's mailbox. Seth intimidated his adopted son,Joey into roasting Vicki's pet parakeets in the oven. It also looks like Mary Jean played a big part in the arranging of Vicki's murder, but doesn't suffer much of a consequence for her role.	I read the first half and skimmed thru the trial because I wanted to be through with the whole depressing evil bunch. Surprised at all the 5 stars.
1,Harrowing, great fiction, page-turner...		Looking over these reviews, I must have read a different book. The characterization was sloppy, to say the least. The guy who said "youse" so you knew he was a louse (and he said it every stinking time he opened his mouth), cardboard characters aplenty, characters who changed their perceptions of each other just long enough to have sex, firefighting facts dropped with the subtlty of lead balloons...		This was the first book I'd read by Suzanne Chazin. Even though I bought the second book at the same time and actually have it in my possession, I can't bring myself to read it. I paid $2 for both books and I feel like I got ripped off.		I suggest Earl Emerson's novels for truly well-written firefighter novels. Emerson is a firefighter and, unlike Chazin, manages to create a believeable and taut thriller.
1,I do love the Red Team and have loved every other book but this storyline was totally off the reservation.  Fanciful, dark and totally unbelievable I'm afraid.		The responses from the Red Team at times seemed far too "touchy feely" for the type of characters they were meant to be which really annoyed me as well.		I have loved the series but won't be back for more.
1,Judge Posner promises a far-reaching analysis of the impeachment and trial of President Clinton.  In his introduction, he notes that the "ordeal" presented numerous axes of analysis: issues of law, issues of jurisprudence, issues of morality, theories of conflict, issues of political and cultural sociology. (p. 3)	In applying these analytical perspectives to the particular issues raised within the context of President Clinton's impeachment, I think Judge Posner does an excellent job at cutting through the political spin and identifying the essential points.  He deftly exposes "it's all about sex" as the dishonest mantra that Clinton supporters, such as James Carville, used to divert the public's attention away from the basic legal issues.  His discussion of the relevant legal charges--obstruction of justice and perjury--is clear and accessible.  Once the political spin is redacted, the conclusion is inescapable--Clinton committed perjury and thus violated the law.	Yet Judge Posner's book is ultimately dissatisfying.  His book promises more than it delivers, and what I think is a significant issue--the nature of impeachment as it has been understood and used within the American constitutional order--remains relatively untouched by Posner's book.  This is frustrating.	Beyond passing references to Samuel Chase and Andrew Johnson, Judge Posner never discusses their impeachment or their resulting trials.  He notes the distinction between impeachment standards for judges versus the President, but he never discusses in any detail the impeachment and conviction of any judges.  (The only discussion is Judge Posner's reference to Judge Nixon's impeachment and conviction for perjury in 1989, but this is made in a single-sentence footnote on page 103.)  In his discussion of censure, Judge Posner writes that "Congress has used censure sparingly" (p. 191), but beyond a couple references to President Jackson, he never discusses any of the situations in which Congress has censured a government official and what this meant for Congress in 1998/1999.	Maybe I had unrealistic expectations, but with a chapter entitled "The History, Scope and Form of Impeachment," I was really hoping for some substantial scholarship on the constitutional issue of impeachment as it has been used against many judges and two Presidents in our nation's history.  Unfortunately, I was left with the sense that Judge Posner should have spent a few extra months doing additional research to produce a true scholarly exegesis, rather than join the rush to publish in the wake of the impeachment media frenzy.
1,Written in broken English; just a list of commands; hard to follow.
1,One star is too generous.  I'd give it none if I could.  I am an experienced Access user, but like most people, I am confused by the new "ribbon" design.  I took a course at a local community college which uses this book.  It is terrible.  It is more like a comic book, with little real direction.  The tutorials are confusing, and do not include basic design info, such as copying the database periodically to avoid redos if a msitake is made. Many of the directions do not work (per using Microsoft for guidance).  The formatting is pathetic.  It is difficult to find anything.  It really lacks focus and a clear methodology.  The entire impression I have is that it was thrown together very quickly without a lot of thought, or review.  Clear and concise are words evidently unknown to the authors.  The format is almost comoc book in nature, and the color scheem becomes overwhelming after 2 pages.  It's only use is in a landfill.  I can't say enough negative things about it.  My sympathies to poor students who have to pay the exhorbant price for garbage.
1,Very poorly written and/or edited.
1,I really looked forward to this book's publication because I love biographies, especially those about people I have never heard of before. However, this book is a tedious read that goes on and on about the stocks she buys and sells, her law suits and deals, and very little else. If you're interested in the mercurial stock market, predominately railroad, of the 1800s, then this may interest you. While clearly researched in depth, the author never made the woman herself come to life. That is sad because she certainly seems like she could have been quite interesting.
1,It has been a few years since I read Edna Buchanan's other books, but I remember enjoying them a lot, so I was really disappointed when I downloaded this book from Audible.  It hadn't been reviewed yet, so the whole time I forced myself to listen to it I kept writing my review in my head, hoping to prevent others from making the same mistake I had in purchasing it.  I lost track of all the eye-rollingly awful parts I wanted to mention, but it would take too many pages anyway.  The plot is like something from a comic book intended for 12 to 15 year-old boys--cartoonish good and bad guys, many and varied life or death situations, unnecessary characters, and details that go nowhere and add nothing.  It reads like it was pieced together from a bunch of disparate 9th grade creative writing papers--  "Just write a ten-page crime story, kids, and turn it in by tomorrow."		 A US Marshall in the Witness Protection Program becomes disillusioned when one of his scumbag "clients" is relocated, his testimony against another scumbag pending, and commits not one, but three different crimes after relocation.  The protagonist, Michael Venturi, suspecting the crook of two of the crimes, travels to check him out and catches him with evidence in his freezer and coincidentally in the middle of another, completely different kind of crime.  Venturi is able to intervene, spectacularly and anonymously, so that the crook is caught for all three crimes.  Venturi does something with the third crime's proceeds that is totally indefensible and unnecessary to the furtherance of the "plot."  Of course, Witsec was so focused on using this guy's testimony against some organized crime figure that they didn't even care what else the witness was up to as long as he was able to testify.  Suspecting that Venturi was involved in exposing the witness's post-relo fiendishl activities, his soulless government bosses basically drum him out of the Service.  Never mind that two of the crimes are so egregious that no law enforcement officer, I don't care who else he is trying to nail, would ever allow them to be ignored or covered up just to preserve a witness's testimony.  Never mind that even Sammy the Bull wouldn't  have risked getting involved with the final crime, at least until after he'd testified and could go a little more low profile.  Why the third crime, anyway?  The relocated witness was so evil this unrelated crime was unnecessary , unless one of the 9th graders was promised his submission would be incorporated somewhere in the final story.		Anyway, our perfect hero quits and uses the MILLIONS he conveniently happens to have, untouched lawsuit proceeds (don't even ask), to relocate truly "deserving" folks, and the ridiculousness continues, branching out into threads that often go nowhere.  Some of these lucky relos don't even have a especially good or believable reason to disappear (a rock star, weary of the inconveniences of his fame?--yeah, creating his new identity is worth going to jail for), and Venturi and his pals give no thought to collateral damage.  Authorities waste time and money on investigations into the "deaths" and no one even mentions the fact that insurance companies will have to pay out millions of dollars to cover resulting claims.  But, hey,  that's just free money, isn't it?  The dialogue is silly and inappropriate for a lot of the situations--joking and joshing when people start to die and Venturi and his co-conspirators are close to being exposed .  The one-dimensional tough guy Latino military buddy has a  roving eye and the truly annoying habit of repeating the word "Bro."  Bad enough in print--try LISTENING to it over and over, as read by a truly bad narrator.  "Bro, tell my wife I love her, bro"  Followed by, "It's not your time.  Your name isn't on that big blackboard in the sky."  Edna, oh, Edna.		Minor point, but I was irritated that  former Marine Venturi didn't seem to know what an Osprey was--the plane/helicopter aircraft  that his "bro" always wanted to fly.  I knew what it was in the mid 90's, and I am a middle-aged female from corporate America.  Of course, an Osprey must inexplicably appear to whisk said "bro" away at some point.  I could go on and on.  I am starting to suspect that Edna has a teenage kid she allowed to publish his/her first book under her name.  The plot was all over the place, the characters and situations cartoonish, and the ending was so dumb it still makes my teeth ache.  I don't think the author had decided whom to make the real villain until she got to the end--it just had to be someone really unexpected.  Have to admit, I didn't see it coming, because it was so LUDICROUS--the villain, the villain's reasons for the havoc wreaked, etc. Let's throw in the Russion mob, shall we?  Conveniently,  the villain is the type who explains, in great detail, everything that happened and why, since Venturi is to die anyway.		I wasn't expecting great literature.  I just wanted a fun read (listen) that didn't insult my intelligence.  I had to immediately check out a Val McDermid thriller to try to flush the memory away.  Didn't work.  Seriously, this is the worst book I have read or listened to in years, and I hate myself for finishing it.  Sorry Edna, you have lost me for good.
1,If you are interested in following fat Sam Tarly on a long boat ride that he spends puking and that culminates with him diddling the inbred chick while drunk - this book is for you...		If you are interested in following Brienne from town to town asking the wrong questions and going in the wrong direction while you as the reader already know the answer to vain pursuit - this book is for you...		If you don't mind spending chapters after chapters after chapters in Cerseies head doing some third rate scheming  when all the first class players are either dead, lost or simply taking a hiatus from the drudgery that has become Westeros - this book is for you		If you like reading a chapter on a teenager building a snow castle, feeding a retarded toddler and attend a meeting in which she has no actual role - this book is for you		Yup, its a mess and the author is stalling for a paycheck for a decade now with no apparent vision or desire to bring this to a close. The saddest part is that this book is still better then the next one. At least it follows some story line, albeit a boring one.
1,Over the past year, I have tried to expand my reading genre with a variety of types of books. I have added some fiction, spiritual growth, and biographies to my normal theology and Christian living books. One book that somewhat falls into the biography (or autobiography) category is The Fourth Fisherman by Joe Kissack. It is the story of Kissack's life, told by himself, interwoven with the story of the three Mexican fishermen who drifted through the Pacific Ocean for more than nine months. How do the two relate?		Kissack had it all. He had risen to the top of the corporate latter. But he admits that he was lost. Under so much pressure to continue to perform, he started to self medicate with alcohol and drugs. Eventually, the life of cards that he had created came crashing down. He was lost. He was an image of the man that he said that he was. It was during this time that he found faith in God.		The first half of the book is evenly divided between his story and the story of the fishermen who drifted out to sea. They too were lost. As the story is told, they survived on rain water, turtle blood, fish, and the Bible. Well, at least one of the fisherman was committed to the Bible. His faith kept him going. And it seems as though it became contagious as the others expressed faith as well.		The second half of the book is Kissack's story of feeling called to pursue the fishermen and tell their story. He traveled to Mexico and back several times trying to gain their trust and eventually gaining an exclusive deal with them to tell their story. His message throughout the ordeal was that he felt just like them. He was lost as they were lost and his survival only came about through faith.		The book is fairly well written. It moves at a quick pace. I found myself wanting to find out what was happening, more in the life of the fishermen than in Kissack's life. I found their story more intriguing, and wish it would have been told in more depth. But this book is ultimately not about them. It is about Joe. It is about how Joe was at the top, came crashing down, and is starting the climb again. And it is all because of faith.		This book represents a segment of books out there that have to do with faith. But what I found very lacking in this book is "faith in what?" Faith in God is so vague. We are told in James that even the demons believe in God (2:19). Saying that their faith in God was what got them through their trying times does not do much for me. Even the salvation experience that Kissack tells leaves me wanting more. He went to bed wanting to die and had an experience in the middle of the night when he woke up in the middle of the night soaking wet with a peace he had never before experienced. He woke his wife and said, "I think...God has just come into my life" (80). He goes on to describe it:		"I didn't fully understand exactly what happened that night. Even today, I don't know the mystery of it, but here's what I think: In the simplest of terms, when I formed the thought, Please just let me die, I was giving up my tight, desperate hold on my life. I had surrendered the life I had been barely living, not in exchange for another kind of life, but just because I was simply out of options. That night, I was free-falling like a jet fighter in a death spiral...and God stretched out His big supernatural safety net and caught me" (81).		No mention of the cross of Jesus Christ. No mention of faith alone in Jesus as his substitute. No mention of the wrath of God being satisfied. No mention of repentance of sin. Nothing. Just, "I think God came into my life." Now, I am not saying those things didn't happen. They might have. But why not mention them if they did? Why is there a lot of talk of faith, but no mention of Jesus in this book (actually, I can only remember one mention of Jesus, but not in the context of salvation by faith alone through Him).		It is ironic at the same time I am reading Christless Christianity by Michael Horton who picks up on Christian Smiths view that the religion of our day is Moralistic, Therapeutic Deism. I just couldn't help but think of that as I read this book. It is a good story, but I have not hope with what was written that Jesus is the redeemer that rescued Kissack from the guilt and power of his sin. I pray it is true, but you cannot get that from this book. And neither can you from the faith of the fishermen. No mention of the gospel at all. Just faith.		I received a free copy of The Fourth Fisherman by Joe Kissack from Waterbrook Press for review.
1,This title blew me away--it's so beautiful I thought the story and characters would be just as wonderful, but I was so wrong. I was bored most of the way through (and pretty pissed off about all of the drinking and driving) and it was not a book I was excited to read at the end of the day. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,DISCLAIMER Let me start by saying EZ is a genius, and her talents derserve 5 Stars. If I was writin this review 20 years ago, I would be 10, but I would also give this book 5 Stars.  My 2 Star review is on the book itself & not EZ's concept, talent, or instructions.		Anyone born around the first publication of this book may immediately be turned off by the fact that this book is only in black & white - the text looks like it was printed on a typewriter, and the graphs are handwritten.  While this may have been acceptable in 1981 - its a shame that this book hasn't been updated & released with newer pictures, graphs & a few new ideas to accompany EZ's original patterns & ideas.		I began knitting 10 years ago & this is my first exposure to EZ.  I would consider myself to be an intermediate knitter, but the concepts presented in this book are still revolutionary.  I think a revision to this classic is long overdue.  I know that color techniques described could be better presented in color, and that the graphs could be also easier to read in color as well.		I realize that EZ would say that I should use the concept in this book to make my own "new" patterns, but some of us would really appreciate newer (more modern) examples of how her concepts work.  Sometimes its hard to even want to understand something when it looks so dated & old fashioned.		So I am asking, please, please someone take this book and breathe new life into it!  Give the knitters of my generation (Gen X) a version of EZ that is accessible to us!  You don't have to throw away her values or even re-write her words!  Just liven her up a bit to what her granddauhter's might find fun & enjoyable
1,Overall this was a comfortable and easy read. The beginning half of the book was overall quite good and maintained the reader's interest. Then things seemed to go downhill. The plot reminded me of a B-class movie towards the end. A pet peeve of mine is when chararacters in books or movies do stupid, illogical things like neglect to call the police in an obviously hazardous situation. This was one of those books where I had to cringe at situations like this.
1,I loved this series and was excited for this book to finally be released. But I am seriously disappointed. I was bored. Nothing really happened that made me like this one. I had re read the other 3 books this week leading up to this release. The first 2 get 5 stars. 4 stars for book 3. This book barely gets 2 stars in my opinion. I'm not sure if I'll even bother reading book 5. I sure as heck won't if its not released for another year and a half like this one...
1,Slow, predictable, not much different from other novels about war.sacrifice, and the Holocaust.
1,Bestseller in Canada? I don't think so. I finally got a copy of this book to see what it's about and was quite dissapointed. Biggest problem is the writing style - simple and not in a good way, boring in every sense of the word....just a total wreck. Anyway, judging by the lack of substantial reviews on this page, it's obvious to me that most readers have done themselves a favour and steered clear of this one.	I don't usually take the time to write reviews on public forums, but I have to for this one. Ugh. I really hated it. Perhaps the author could benefit from some creative writing programs, because....ugh. Just, ugh.
1,was not like the other murder club series. knew how it was going to turn out right away . was not a book that you could not put down	first time i have been disappointed in a James Patterson book
1,Horrible editing.  Weak story.  No depth to characters.  Will never read something by this "author" again.
1,Disappointed by the mundane treatment - it's very "Mumsy"!
1,I am a first time reader of Cheryl Holt. I never liked the time period where women are treated as possessions and really stupid.  Where the man is the smartest and all powerful. This is one of those books.  However, it also shows how much progress women have made, all on their own, fighting every step of the way and never giving up. In London, England, 1813, Kate Duncan has been stripped of her title and money but doesn't know it. She falls for Lucas, a man of wealth and power. A love potion adds a bit of intrigue to the story. Kate and Lucas sleep together again and again.  This is a R rated book for me. I found the sex scenes primal and the sexual language very blunt and crude.  Maybe that's exactly what the author meant it to be. Maybe the words fit the time period. I do like books with a happy ending and this has that.  I will give this author another try.  I enjoyed the flow of her writing and her ability to bring life to her words.
1,with a story called "hair in my ass crack" this book had the earmark of the type of refined reading I enjoy. I had no idea that these ruminations were in poetry form . the last time I read poetry was about the time sylvia plath stuck her head in the oven and then forgot to remove it.
1,This book is so "hard boiled" that there isn't room for a story. One long "pissing" contest. Made me weary.
1,Not that interesting
1,This book started out with promise; however, it has a lot of problems, which previous reviewers have already pointed out.  I would like to add that the editing was very shoddy as well.  At one point the word "grizzly" is used to describe something gruesome, when the word should have been "grisly".  This kind of mistake pulls me out of the story, and makes me lose respect for both the editor and the author.
1,I am so happy to see the majority of reviewers showing their distaste for the $14.99 premium price of this ebook!  I wanted to give the book zero stars because I can't even start to read it until the first hurdle is cleared: price.		I don't blame Amazon.  Apple started this crap back in Jan 2010 when they met with MacMillan and implemented the agency model whereby the publisher sets the selling price and then other publishers followed.		I hope the overall rating of this book sinks home with the publisher, Hachette Book Group, and they lower the price NOW.  When this happens then I will buy, read, and review it based on the other factors that make up a book review.		****		Finished reading THE FIFTH WITNESS now that the pricing debacle is resolved.  Michael Connelly is one of the best writers in the industry.  His word flow is effortless for me while reading one of his books: less is more.  The plot was good but the book contained too much courtroom action for me.  I know Mickey is a lawyer but I don't ever recall one of MC's books being so heavy on the legal.  I liked the title as it related to the book but the end was a bit predictable as it wrapped up.		I hope that the publisher does not try to release his next book, THE DROP, for $15 as was done with this one.  Price remains the first hurdle for me.  I do not want to rate another MC book at 1 star so hopefully they learned from this one.
1,Fletch' Fortune is MacDonald's tribute to the age-old tradition of hotel murder mystery weekends where a bunch of people at an out-of the-way hotel usually in the Catskills get together, one is murdered, and everyone has a motive and is a suspect.  Throw in the CIA, a little blackmail, and a bunch of piranhas known as journalists, and you have a story.  Or do you?  It is filled with clever, snarky dialogue, but way too much meaningless banter.  It's a snoozefest and rather boring.
1,I'm sorry to say that I was unable to get through this book. Actually, I couldn't even make it through the first chapter. No matter how many times I tried to pick it up and read it, I would find myself several pages in without knowing how I got there or what I had just read. I was unable to focus on the book and found that my mind would wander off to other things. This Mongoliad series just didn't capture my interest at all.
1,Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy:	[...]		THE LAST JEWISH VIRGIN was a difficult book for me to write about, if only because I feel like I shouldn't be reviewing it in the first place.  Most of this book felt like an allegory that I couldn't unlock, or a parable whose moral I didn't understand.  Despite a blurb that made me think this would be more accessible, I can say with confidence that THE LAST JEWISH VIRGIN shouldn't be classified as Urban Fantasy or Paranormal Romance.		My main point of disconnect with this story was the main character, Lilith.  From the outset, it is clear that Lilith is unreliable and melodramatic.  Seemingly simple events take place, all the while with Lilith quaking, shuddering, and generally over-acting her own story.  When speaking to the Urban Fantasy genre, Lilith is the anti-thesis of heroine that learns and develops throughout the story.  If nothing else, her break from reality grows more and more pronounced, and rather than believing that any real paranormal events were taking place around her, I was more convinced that she had an eating disorder, delusions, and an unhealthy obsession with her professor.		I have read books where an unreliable narrator adds spice to the proceedings, and I was able to enjoy untangling their observations from the greater "reality" around them (Iain Bank's THE WASP FACTORY comes to mind).  Unfortunately, THE LAST JEWISH VIRGIN never managed to slip me into that process.  The book's arc did not center on Lilith (or the reader) gaining any greater sense or reality.  Rather, we all spin deeper into Lilith's psychosis without hesitation or clarity.  THE LAST JEWISH VIRGIN creates a caricature of an UF heroine in the real world.  If Bella were written in the real Forks, Washington, most likely she would have ended up in a mental institution or dead in an alleyway when her blood-drinking, older "boyfriend" showed his true psychotic colors.  That was the fate I kept expecting for poor Lilith (and part of me still believes that is Lilith's "off camera" future).		While I don't want to give you the impression that THE LAST JEWISH VIRGIN was poorly written, it was certainly not something I would read for pleasure.  There are details from the book that I enjoyed and will remember, and as a concept it is an interesting premise, but the process of reading this book was more chore than enjoyment for me.		Sexual Content: Descriptions of sex acts and sexual situations.
1,this is a very silly book. everyone is so selfish, determining to make their own way, no matter how it affects the others. there are enough silly selfish people running around, we don't need books idolizing that sort of behavior.
1,It is very rare that I have such a hard time slogging through a book. I wanted to give up many times but I kept hoping it would get better. I found this book to be very disjointed. It got bogged down with too many characters that did not add to the story. It was very hard to keep up with. I also wasn't really able to very well tie the past to the present. Then the third part of the story about the lawsuit totally didn't fit in. It's not even in the summary of what the book is about. I don't see how it added to the tale. It was much less magic and mystery than I expected it to be and I was VERY happy when it was over. If you want a good past/present story try Karen White's books. She does it much better.
1,Very disapointing ending after a long buildup. Characterization is okay, but not brilliant. This book could have been much better.
1,I must agree with the majority on this one.  It has to be the worst book I've ever read in my life.	I made the mistake of buying a used copy online without reading any of the reviews first.  Of course, I'm thinking, "Hey, she wrote SATC, she's gotta be pretty good".  But, oh, was I ever wrong!  Now I know why the book itself was only sold for 89 cents and I SERIOUSLY regret paying the S&H for it.  What a waste!!	Don't think I've ever been unable to finish a book, but I just couldn't torture myself with this literary garbage any longer.  I never made it past the 2nd part about Winnie.  I was so disgusted with the first character, Janey, and I HATED the way the second part was written.	I just received a copy of Bushnell's 'Trading Up' as a part of an online book club and I returned it immediately.  If I didn't like Janey in 4 Blondes, I'll hate an entire book about her upper-class wannabe lifestyle.  Hello, she's a shallow, self-absorbed prostitute!!!	Please, I beg you, don't waste your time on this one.
1,I don't care for her style.  If I had paid more attention I would have never purchased her book.  I don't believe there is ANY reason a woman or girl needs to be sexually involved with a man before she is married.  I know there are many people who would disagree with me because they want that type of relationship.  I believe the women and girls don't see their full value or the full value of their potential husband when they make that choice.  Whether they realize it or not they are damaging their potential relationship and hurting hurting each other.
1,I was disappointed that the amendments were not included. I had to purchase another book to get them.
1,Didn't bother to finish!
1,The cause of the downfall of our country. This book illustrates exactly what true leaders and citizens should NOT do.
1,Suzi, the narrator, of the THE LOVELY BONES tells her story from heaven. She tells us how she was lured into an underground cave where she was brutally raped and murdered. This is not a "who dun it" book. She shows us from the start. This book is a gripping piece about grief, love, and family with an odd coming-of-age angle. She has trouble letting go. She is in heaven (almost/sort of) but won't let go of the "why" to be able to go fully into heaven.		I don't really appreciate when people make stuff up about heaven. Not that I have strong views about what it will be like, I just avoid filling my head with ideas, I don't think it will be anything like what anyone thinks. I was annoyed at everything that happened in the "heaven" scenes and noticed I breezed through those parts. Avoidance.		My opinion about the storyline is that it is AWEFUL, only because it is so painful to hear about a child being raped and murdered. It was painful to read this book from beginning to end. Their family is of course torn apart because of the murder of Suzie. Of course her father went crazy looking for his baby, of course her mother avoided the pain and had an affair. It was hard to finish because of all the pain in this novel. But one can say that it did its job. It made an impression. It got to me. I wanted to cry. I wanted to kill the bad guy.		With that in mind I am having a hard time determining the "time value" of this novel. I almost wished I hadn't read it because of all the pain in it. Yet, Alice did her job by getting to me through all that emotion. When I think about the latter, I say 3. But when I think about how much it hurt, I'm settling on a 2: Somewhat not worth the time invested.
1,I have read and appreciated Mr. Hanson's work on warfare in the classical era. He should stick to that. With "The Savior Generals" he has allowed his parallel career as a right-wing pundit to bleed over into his work as a historian. This book is history with an agenda. How so?		-Byzantium was handicapped by big government with a "vast public bureaucracy and the welfare state..." This resulted in an eroding military and "fewer Byzantines engaged in private enterprise." (Page 52)		-President Truman rashly dismantled our defense establishment after World War II to facilitate "a redirection of federal spending to new comprehensive social entitlements." Which entitlements? The GI Bill? (Page 151).		-Communism's appeal in post-war East Asia was the result of "largesse" to the local populations. No recognition is allowed for the appeal of Marxist economics, land reform or the impact of anti-colonial sentiment. (Page 154)		-He castigates leading Democrats for supporting President Bush's invasion of Iraq and then latter opposing the same without benefit of consideration that their initial support was based upon flawed, or outright phony, intelligence concerning Weapons of Mass Destruction. (Page 192)		-The October 11, 2002 congressional authorization for the use of force to remove Saddam Hussein was "in some sense...merely a restatement of a prior 1998 congressional authorization for `regime change' in Iraq, supported and signed by Bill Clinton." The Clinton resolution did not commit the U.S. to use military force against Iraq. The invasion of Iraq cannot be lain in Clinton's lap. (Page 198)		-The U.N. Security Council declined to authorize the Iraq invasion and "there were loud NATO dissenters such as France and Russia." France withdrew from the integrated command structure of NATO in 1966 and did not rejoin until 2009. Russia has never been part of NATO. (Page 198)		-Iraq was saved due to "The Surge" which was the brainchild of a Neo-Con pantheon from the American Enterprise Institute listed on Page 213. Now Iraq's economy remains a shambles, sectarian violence is rife, and minority Christians and Sunnis remain endangered. Many thousands have died. Only Iran emerged a winner. How is this being saved? If General Petraeus saved anything it was a modicum of face for President Bush.		-I would refrain from writing a serious piece on General Petraeus using Paula Broadwell as a source (See various footnotes and bibliography).		Of the five generals profiled, the section on Matthew Ridgway makes the best argument for him as a "savior" general. Ridgway could genuinely be portrayed as the savior of U.N. forces in Korea and of South Korea as an independent state. Without his impact on the battlefield, South Korean may not have grown into an economic powerhouse and democratic example for East Asia.
1,Very long verbose account by a son whose mother was carjacked and murdered.  Not a police procedural or in-depth analysis of the killer.  Mostly, a family memoir.  Nice people, one and all, but ordinary and superficially portrayed.
1,Mark Tufo is one of my favorite writers.  His, 'Zombie Fallout' series is par excellance.  Mark must channel his own free-association thought process directly through his alter-ego in that series and absolutely nothing I've read before or since come's closer to reaching me inside as far as fiction goe's.  I feel inside about that man and those characters.  Looking for more Tufo I read, "Indian Hill-Encounters', and it is a good first writing and was then exceeded by Zombie Fallout.		Ok, "Dr. Hugh Mann", I read this and it read's like a run of the mill genre book.  Mark's essence is missing from this book and only a ghost-like residue remains.  If I read correctly, Mark had 'help' proofing and apparently re-writing this one as the lack of core-value and meandering story with little staying power is evident.  It look's like someone took out all that Tufo is and watered it down.		Mr. Tufo's writes better than this on his own, he doesn't need any 'help'.  I'm sorry, Mark, but you shine brightest by yourself.		I wish I could talk to the author and explain and apologize for my comments but, "Dr. Hugh Mann" isn't a great book in the ZF tradition and frankly I don't think it stand's very well on it's own as any book should.
1,As reviewed on KayFrayBooks		I'm not sure how I feel about this book. It feels incredibly juvenile. Yes it is written from the POV of a sheltered 16-year-old girl but other YA books have managed to do the same thing while coming off more... I don't know.. polished? I guess.		I think that if I didn't read as much as I do, I would have enjoyed this book more. Let me explain... because I read so much (several books a week) I know what it feels like to have a really good book suck you in and make you feel part of it. Book that, if you manage to put down, you do nothing but think about the characters until you can pick it back up again. While the story deed keep me mildly entertained (there were some parts where I had to force myself to keep reading rather than giving up on the book completely) it did not grab my attention and allow my mind to escape into that world.		I do like the premise, but everything else felt a bit lacking. There isn't much character depth, the world building leaves a lot to be desired and the dialog is stiff.		It kills me to start a series and not finish it, even when they are bad. I'm giving this series one more book to win me over before I call it quits on the ELE Series.
1,I stumbled accidentally into Christian fiction and I am backing out as fast as I can! This book should be tagged as faith-based. Not everyone wants to read about prayers and not fitting in because ya know, Jesus! Pretty vanilla overall. Not for the open-minded.
1,Kind of silly not my type of book
1,I just bought this edition of the NIV Study Bible on the Kindle version with the hopes that it would easily take me to book and chapter but it does not do this easily.  You can if you do a search and type in the place you want to go but then it also brings up every place else it references what you're looking for.  So not a good compatibility for ease of use on the Kindle!  I was able to return it right away and I did so and promised to write a definitive review of ease of navigation.  It's not easy.
1,Complete drivel. Written from the perspective that glib generalities are a substitute for thought and substance. I actually felt my IQ lowering as I tried to force my way through the miasmic wanderings the author used to pad out the book between bits of content on the subject of the book. If those bits had been anything special, the wading might have been worth it, but they are only insipid reflections, not insights.		Go enjoy any of his numerous interviews available elsewhere--skip this book.
1,very satisfied with this product.
1,Couldn't get threw 1/2 way of this book, it was more, for a much younger crowd of readers. It was misleading to me. Teenager would be most likely to have a lot of interest in this story. Wish i could of taken it back, but oh well my grandson will readt his
1,I had high hopes for this book. One thing that he said that turned me off was that he said that "Miracles don't come from God"! Well where else do they come from?  The other information contained in the book was ok though I will never buy another book from this author.
1,This book is about 2.5 stars for me, it might of been 3 if I had paid less. I don't even know where to start. Twisted just didn't have any of the charm and little of the humor that Tangled had. I absolutely loved Tangled, both Drew and Kate were fun and great characters. Unfortunately in this book Drew comes off as a total jerk and Kate is just sad. The writing itself is still good and I still liked the format in which Emma Chase uses. It was the story that I had a hard time with, the "misunderstanding" was almost ridiculous and went on to long. Not to mention how each character reacts to situations is just so disappointing. I do not recommend Twisted, pretend the story ended at Tangled and don't waste your money.		****spoiler alert****	I loved Drew in the first book, flaws and all. However in this book his flaws are over the top and his very immature reaction that has him getting drunk and bringing a stripper home to get back at Kate is just such a jerk move. The book was short, however while Kate was in OH it felt like forever, I actually skimmed a lot of that part. The end was better but not enough to save the book.
1,As a lot of readers, I have read all of Thayer's books and look forward to each new book.  This one disappointed me.  I thught it was silly.
1,This short biography reads like it's been badly copied and pasted from Ron Chernow's much more extensive and substantiated work. No original document is quoted, or even read in some cases given the confusion in relating dates and facts that Hamilton himself had put to paper e.g. In the infamous Reynolds Pamphlet. If you want to investigate Hamilton's timeline and political legacy as well as his private life beyond a Wikipedia like profile, you had better go for Chernow's biography: even if you might not agree with all his conclusions (e.g. I strongly disagree with his stance on Hamilton's feelings to his sister-in-law, those few letters are light years less affectionate though sometimes flirtatious, than his love letters to his fiance and wife Eliza), you will at least be given material to think for yourself and draw your own conclusions.
1,. Usually like Stuart Woods, Hate the old West  theme
1,This book was repititive and poorly written each first time. Most annoying the characters are poorly drawn and easily confused with one another. Starting with a good idea it devolves into...well..rubbish. Waste of time. Don't go here.
1,I usually enjoy Christy Barritt novels. This is the exception.  Imagine a detective jogging in front of a house. He hears a scream, crashing sounds and bursts through the door. The house is thrashed. He finds his neighbor hanging by a noose from a ceiling fan, her feet are barely touching a stool. She has a gash on her head, her lip is split and her hands are bound. He thinks... suicide attempt.  HELLO! I could not get immersed in this story. The characters never came to life and it was seriously lacking  logical thought.
1,The storyline was just not there. No answers unfolded. Too much past, present and future jumbled together.  The book could not hold my attention.
1,Michael Fullan,  proposes the need for engagement of the moral imperatives in education. Typical of post enlightenment theorists, Fullan has three major shortcomings: First, he is mostly  focused on process that has no end or goal; Second, he is naively positivist in his assessment of education because it is bound by the limited and dysfunctional enlightenment anthropological assumptions about the person and education; Third, this positivist assessment of the person leads to a faulty over emphasis on systems of education rather than on the proper focus of the relationship of love between the teacher and the student.		 Beginning with the well worn de Tocquevillean bromide that education is the primary democratizing institution in our culture Fullan asserts that schools develop understanding of "truth, beauty, and justice". However, the overwhelming problem with this naively positivist position is that Fullan treats "truth, beauty, and justice" as self -defining when these definitions are the very essence of the conflict of democracy. "Moral", all by itself, has no content, it is merely the behavioral imperatives of one's presuppositions about life. For example, if one presupposes that being a human person is primarily about the maximization of the number of choices and potential choices and calls that "freedom" then the horror of abortion is "moral", "true" and "just". If one sees life as a sacred gift then one properly sees abortion as murder and resistance to abortion is "moral", "true" and "just". "Moral" is a human faculty that has no necessary content to it and to observe and insist that education has a moral component to it is no more revelatory than the recognition that education has a biological, psychological, or spiritual aspect to it. By definition it must because it involves human persons whom are composed of these faculties		The obvious issue is that the various "systems that make up the global village" are in competition with one another and that some are true and some are false. It is to an important degree a zero sum enterprise. For example, the assumptions about the person in enlightenment anthropology like Fullan's is largely incompatible with Muslim anthropology, which in turn is somewhat incompatible with Christian anthropology which is incompatible with atheist humanist anthropology. However, one gets the sense that Fullan feels, wrongly, that enlightenment anthropology is somehow above this conflict.		While it is true that "no other profession enables on the opportunity to provide such a positive impact on a child's overall development" it is equally true that a child is particularly vulnerable to being harmed and distorted by educational theorists like Fullan's whims. For example, in Massachusetts MCAS or business setting the education agenda has serious consequences that often overwhelm the student and the "personal vision" of teachers. In fact, these imperatives bind and constrict "personal vision". Is this good or bad? Fullan has no ability to say because these words have no content in Fullan but are indicative of nearly empty process. "Continuous learning" of itself is of no value and is no self-correcting norm if one's continuous learning is improperly oriented or committed to begin with. To broadly make the point one can be "continuously learning" to relativize what is in fact "true, beautiful, just" so that one can freely commit horrors like concentration camps, abortion or possible genetic experiments to serve an abstraction like "quality of life". Fullan's focus on process and commitment to institution is flawed. In the end, education is more determined by whether the teacher is a wise and loving person rather than on a better institutional scheme. Fullan stumbles across this but only on the way to make the point that we need to have more and better collaboration to build better systems. This is always the trap of post enlightenment theorists. The point is to better educate this or that particular boy or girl who is in front of you now, through being a wise and loving teacher, not to be focused on abstractions like systems and their improvements.
1,Some books are more than the sum of their parts. These would be literature, books that resonate in the head long after they are put down, books full of people and ideas and emotion. Some books equal the sum of their parts. These would be skillfully done fiction. Pleasant, worthy of the time invested, but not "for the ages" or even for more than right now. Then there are books such as this one. It is way less than the sum of its parts, and trust me, even that ain't much. Best forgotten, though remembering them would be the more difficult task.	While there are some amusing pieces in here, they are scattered like oases in the vast desert. It is incredibly lame, predictable, and dull. The characters would have to expand to be one-dimensional, and there are too many of them to even make much of an impression. It begins to feel like the Keystone Kops after a while, one zany, wild and spectacularly unamusing event after another. Improbable coincidences and silly plot twists heap up like ants on a grasshopper carcass.	Thankfully the book is very brief. Though there are over 300 pages, those pages look like many twenty-page college term papers, with wide margins, broad line-spacing, and large type.	I have been reading Dave Barry since he began writing back in Pittsburgh. I've read millions of his columns. The man is funny. But a funny man does not necessarily equal a funny novel. This is not funny. Not well-plotted. Not suspenseful. Not clever. Not witty. Not sparkling. Not interesting. Not amusing. Not fun. Not surprising. Not well-written. Not worth the money.
1,Please remember this book is fictional! History buffs will laugh out loud at the monumental misrepresentations of history.	There are no facts in this book; in truth, it's been completely and thoroughly debunked by Ralph Woodrow, who at one time took this book seriously (also at Amazon here http://www.amazon.com/The-Babylon-Connection-Ralph-Woodrow/dp/0916938174/ref=pd_sim_b_1 ).	Here, Hislop's main premise / conspiracy theory is that Nimrod in the Bible married his mother, Simaramis (never mind that she was from another culture and country and wasn't born till centuries later) and that the 'mystery religion' they invented went on to become the Catholic Church, over a thousand years later, and across many different cultures and countries, and no one knows about it except for him.  As proof he has numerous sketches 0.o  Which is to say he has no valid references or source material to back up any of his outrageous "revelations".	Nimrod is represented in this book to be Odin, the pope, Zeus,  and about 50 more randomly selected historical figures and myths from the past. The information in this book is so bad, that when you read this, you will laugh and laugh.	If this was in the comedy section, I'd give it 5 starts. Or if you hate Catholics and don't mind believing in wildly inaccurate and mangled fairy-tales, then perhaps this book is for you?
1,Children's Bibles are probably the genre of books I read the most critically and carefully.  These books of stories can greatly enhance our children's grasp of Biblical truth and build a frame in their minds for future Biblical learning to be added onto, or they can cause lasting damage through misrepresenting, undermining, or falsely teaching what the Bible is about. I had casually flipped through The Children's Illustrated Bible in stores and liked the realistic illustrations and informative sidebars with archeological, geological, and historical information and photographs.  I was looking forward to a chance to review it, hoping that my opinions would remain positive after a closer inspection.		Unfortunately, this was not the case.  I read every word on every page of this 309 page book.  I put a sticky tab with notes on each page I had questions/issues with.  There were a LOT of notes sticking out of this book when I was done.		What first drew me to this book were the realistic and detailed illustrations.  While this was a strength with some stories, with others it was a definite draw-back.  For example, while it is true that Adam and Eve were going "au natural" in the garden, I would prefer them to be a little more covered when my young preschooler reads her story Bible!  Nor, do I want her to see a painting, classic or not, of baby Jesus being circumcised.  And I most definitely don't want her to study and ponder a picture of Daniel in the lions' den, where the den has been accurately portrayed filled with human skulls, bones, and blood dripping down the rocks and off of the lion's teeth.  There are also disturbing pictures of soldiers carrying out Herod's orders to kill the male children after Jesus was born (soldiers with bloody swords and mothers begging for mercy with babies huddled in their arms), and of a servant carrying John the Baptist's head, mostly covered by a bloody cloth, on a platter to Salome.		I do appreciate accurate illustrations, but TMI!!  My daughter would be afraid of some of the pictures in this book! [Admittedly, these gory pictures might be a draw to older boys...] :)		As I mentioned, another aspect of this book that I initially appreciated were the sidebars full of extra scientific/ archeological/ historical information and photographs.  Sometimes these things were very interesting and informative - I liked seeing photos of natural items that would have been used to dye garments like Joseph's coat, typical foods eaten by the Egyptians, and traditional house structures from Nazareth.		At times, however, it appeared that the team of people contributing to this book clearly did not hold the Bible to be literally true.  For instance, it is suggested that the Israelites crossed through a "marshy swamp" rather than miraculously through a sea (although the illustration shows them walking through the parted sea), and I was outraged at the "explanation" that manna may have been sweet liquid which seeps from the hammada shrub.  (Really?  Feeding thousands of people for 40 years with sap?  This just ignores the clear description the Bible gives of what manna looked like.) There were many little details like these that I found heretical and could seriously undermine a child's faith in what the Bible says.		Another real danger in paraphrased, abbreviated sections of the Bible in books like these is that any biases held by the authors and editors are included in the text as they "retell" the stories.		For instance, we are told that God rejected Cain's offering because it was not the best of his produce - as we have discussed in the past, we just don't know that for sure.  In addition, God's conversation with Cain in Genesis 3:7 is phrased as, "Why are you angry?... you will succeed if you work hard; and if you do not, the sin will be yours."  This completely changes the issue.  The problem was not that Cain wasn't working hard!		In the story of Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah, the angel stops Abraham and says, "You have proved your perfect love of God by your willingness to sacrifice even your child."  Again, as we have discussed, that is NOT the point.		Where the author and editors' biases are most apparent, however, are in the life and parables of Jesus.  In a two-page summary of Jesus' life and ministry, the text reads, "The death of Jesus is important to Christians because they believe that, in dying, he was showing God's love for all people.  For this reason the cross became the main symbol of Christianity.  Christians believe, however, that death did not put an end to Jesus, but that his spirit lives on, especially through his followers." (207) Notice the complete lack of mention of sin, need for forgiveness, etc - and how His bodily resurrection is ignored!		Each parable begins with an "explanation," which often misses the point and emphasize "good living."  For example - Lazarus and the rich man was "a story to warn people about God's judgment of the selfish."  The Pharisee who prayed in public for show and the Tax Collector who humbly beseeched God for mercy in private were "to show how important it is not to be conceited or to look down on others."		The letters of Paul, also, are summarized with an emphasis on being good rather than on salvation through Christ and resulting deeds which flow out of a changed heart.  "If you follow Jesus, you will find that you can overcome your worst instincts... There is no earthly law to make you into a good person, but if you obey the laws of Jesus, you will not only do what is right, but also find true happiness and peace." (307)		Perhaps this seems like I am being nitpicky.  But parents, if there is ever a time to be picky about books, it is when a book is seeking to represent God's Word and ways to our children.  Read with a critical eye.  Be cautious!  And teach them the actual words that the BIBLE says - not just a paraphrased summary!		My husband had a great idea.  He suggested that I keep this Bible, highlight all the problem areas with a bright highlighter, and use it when our children are older and able to think critically.  When they get to a highlighted section, it will be a time for us to read carefully, pull out our Bibles and carefully compare, and teach them to think and use the Bible as the ultimate standard of what is True.  Maybe we'll make it a game called "spot the heresy." ;)
1,I don't like not liking this.  Sheri Cobb South has written many very delightful books and given me many hours of reading pleasure in the past.  Unfortunately this "new" release of April 2015 is uninspired and derivative, with flat, underdeveloped characters.  It even lacks much wit and humor.  I knew from the first few pages how this story was going to end, and, yes, that's often the case with this genre, but it's the journey there that usually entertains.  This one didn't entertain all that much.		If you've never read anything by Sheri Cobb South before, please don't start with this.  Try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Weaver-Takes-a-Wife/dp/B004NEVLSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Weaver Takes a Wife</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Brighton-Honeymoon/dp/B004X34O6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Brighton Honeymoon</a>&nbsp;or her John Pickett series (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/In-Milady-s-Chamber-John-Pickett-Mysteries-Book-1/dp/B006P7SCSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">In Milady's Chamber (John Pickett Mysteries Book 1)</a>, etc.).  Those do not disappoint.
1,I'm sorry to say that the movie was much better. It had some really good scary parts... but then certain elements that were scary were reintroduced in the story and it became comical almost. Bla.
1,Typical example of the series, except that it is weighted down by a gruesome and largely gratuitous back story. This is the one that will probably keep me from bothering with the rest of the series.
1,This book is about prayer. There are many different types of prayer books, some which encourage prayer, others which educate on prayer, and even more that believe prayer has supernatural powers. Does it? This book believes that it does and that parents need to pray for their children every day to help prevent or survive danger. The book contains instructions and guides on how to pray for children in the capacity of prayer warrior, doing spiritual battle to save their souls and bodies.	The book is divided into sections on prayer. Each section is a topic which contains different prayers that can be prayed as scripted prayers, along with a devotion about parenting. It is designed as either a reference for a sole individual or group of parents gathering together to pray for children.	The author writes with conviction, Ill give them that. However, theologically there are dangerous waters ahead. I do believe in the power of prayer, and have scripted prayers for meals, etc., that have been used for generations since Mt. Sinai. However, can prayer change the tide of battle? HaShem does hear prayer and act on it, but we are also taught in Scripture that He foreknows every event. To argue prayer changes events gives the notion that we can control G-d through prayer. Additionally, if G-d does not answer a prayer the way we want Him to, then we hold Him guilty of the consequences. Thus, putting too much emphasis on prayer being a secret weapon of believers only opens the doors for puffing humans up to the stature of deity, a form of idolatry. There must be humility in recognizing the sovereignty of G-d and that He alone decides. Prayer will not alter that decision.	Should we pray? Yes, of course. Will it matter? Definitely. Will it change G-ds decision? Doubtful. Is prayer a weapon? Only against HaSatan. We are in spiritual battle against forces we cannot see, but we cannot prevent the ultimate reality from occurring. So, even though the author is passionate, I cannot in good faith recommend a book that will easily lead people astray in having a proper theology and doctrine of HaShem.	Disclosure: I have received a reviewer copy and/or payment in exchange for an honest review of the product mentioned in this post.
1,I see that many reviewers have compared Becker to Creighton.  Although I'm no Creighton fan, I have to comment on this.  Creighton writes about some wild stuff - a theme park with real dinosaurs, an enclave of Neanderthals  who nearly survive to modern times and fight battles with Vikings.  But as  riduculous as his stories sound, the science is usually pretty solid.  Only  a small leap of faith or two is required and then Creighton has you.  For  example, if you believe that DNA can survive 65 millions or so (and  paleobiologists still debate this) then Jurassic Park becomes entirely  plausible.	There's nothing plausible in Becker's book - it's all sheer  fantasy.  His geology, anthropology, archaeology, and paleoanthropolgy are  all seriously flawed.  And all this leads to a problem of characterization.  It's hard to believe in characters who seemingly have no knowledge of the  fundamentals of their field.  The scientific characters neither speak nor  act as scientific characters should and would.  The excavation described in  the book is a joke (I'm sorry - I've been on real excavations).	I  stumbled across Becker's bibliography at the end of the book and wasn't  surprised to see that his reading list was a motley collection of science,  psuedoscience, and pure scientic fraud.  And although I have little doubt  he read volumes of psuedoscience, I couldn't help but wonder if he actually  read the scientific books included in the bibliography.  Darwin was  referenced which is ironic because neither Becker nor his characters  exhibit any grasp of scientific methodology and Darwin is pretty thorough  in this regard.	To compound matters, the non-scientific characters are  equally unbelievable for the opposite reason of behaving exactly as you  would expect them to.  The South African arms dealer is stern and ruthless.  What a surprise!  The Latina rebel is tough while beautiful and sultry.  All the non-scientific characters are like this - they come across as  stock-in-trade stereotypes.	Usually I'm pretty pig-headed when I read a  book and will finish it no matter how bad it is.  But LINK got the better  of me and I was forced to put it down about halfway.  I gave the book only  one star (the first time I've rated a book so lowly) not because there was  nothing good in the book at all.  But because the bad so overwhelmed the  good that I couldn't finish reading it.	Becker apparently has aspirations  of being a screenwriter some day.  If his goal is to revive the corny  sci-fi 'B' movies of the 1950s, then he's on the right track.  Only he  needs to develop a sense of humor...
1,99% of the plot in this book was Kate whining to anyone who would listen...I don't think Henry loves me....Henry doesn't love me...I just want Henry to love me. She came across as extremely childish. I really didn't care how she threw her temper tantrum, blabbing their personal issues, in front of the council. Nor did I understand why that turned Henry around when the same discussion in private did not.		But seriously, take away Kate's constant prattling (both verbal and mental) about this issue and there would not be much left of the book.		Anything that could've been interesting was glossed over. For example, their problem is temporarily solved by the trap they set. No description of the trap, or how it worked, making me feel as if the author had no idea herself.		The idea that these immortals act like 16 year old children is also annoying. Especially Persephone and Ava's bickering.
1,The books were too worn out.
1,What a disappointment this book was. First of all, it was boring, it took me forever to read it and I was tempted to put it down several times. Then I get slapped in the face when it turns out Margaret's love affair with Anthony is pure fiction, her maid Fortunata is pure fiction. They were such a large part  of the book, especially Fortunata.
1,I bought this book, but never, ever use it.  The recipes are long and strange and the ones I made weren't all that.  I believe in "keep it simple, stupid."  I get better raves just sticking with tofu--saute onion, fresh garlic, mash in tofu, proceed.  It looks good on the shelf but fails to satisfy.
1,Having read several of Elmore Leonard's books, especially the ones that became movies, I decided to give Djibouti a try. Bad choice. Leonard clearly is out of his element in attempting to use his writing style in an exotic foreign setting. His protagonist is also weak--a woman who is making a film and her black assistant.  The plot wanders around going seemingly nowhere. A number of stereotypical characters are introduced. Killing--lots of killin--happens and it ends. I got about three-quarters through before giving up--something I rarely do.  Leonard is a terrific writer, but even the best strike out once in a while.  Skip this one unless you absolutely have to read everything by Leonard.
1,I admit it has been a decade since Ive ready any Xanth novels, and my perception has changed. I certainly found them amusing at the time. Now, not so much it seems!		Ghost Writer in the Sky, while a fun title, and with several good puns, didn't capture me. For one, I didn't like any of the sets of characters. We have:	1. the ghost writer of Mundania, one of those aspiring authors who cant and shouldnt write, offered an inheritance if he quits his job to write, finds himself with Writers Block, only to be fortuitously approached by a rebel dream colt who wants to practice on unsuspecting Xanth citizens using the writer's story ideas. Like Princess and the Pee, or Goldylocks and the 3 Beers (with female protagonists, where he gets to watch the tale play out. Groan.).	2. 5 lovely naughty princesses of Xanth (whom Im sure weve seen before), effected by these unsavory stories, going after the perpetrator by bringing in folks from Mundania. Meh.	3. The man and the woman from Mundania, brought to Xanth as incorporeal spirits/ghosts who then inhabit the bodies of half-demons in order to get around; these two are obviously destined for each other, especially since the demon womans body is better than the human womans, and especially when she sees him almost seduced (and eaten) by a mermaid she gets jealous and seduces him herself. Groan.		This is all in the first 3 chapters. And Im already bored.		Its not just that the book is one big set of puns (and ellipses), but that its REPEATING puns, puns even I remember from previous books, and puns from previous chapters.	In the interview at the end (worth reading), Piers Anthony admits this book has more (ellipses) material than usual, so its for a little older audience, but to be honest It seems more appropriate for a teenage boys first foray into Xanth, offering a healthy dose of bare torsos and puns to suck them in.		So if you are a current fan of Xanth novels, this might appeal to you as another Xanth adventure, but if you happen to be returning to the series like me, I don't recommend this as a place to jump back in.
1,DNF! I gave up a third of the way through. Waaaaay too descriptive. I hate Tiffany. I hate Manning's inability to stand up for himself. I am so frustrated that I pre-ordered this book and now my money's gone.
1,This had to be the most insipid nonsense I've read in a long time. I'm shocked I even made it past the wedding but I wanted to get to what I'm sure any fan of the first book was interested in, MIRANDA! The initial plot and drama over marrying Max was so unnecessary and a complete waste of time.  All of Andy's energy fretting over Miranda of year's past was equally annoying. Don't bother with this sequel.
1,I just could not suspend belief enough to get into to this story.  While I enjoy mysterious and bizarre premises for stories, Mr Clark just did capture me.  Read at your own risk.
1,If you've read lots of history books, you'll have a very hard time with this book!  Modern activity and terms used, out of place for the time period.  Story line is acceptable, but characters lack depth.
1,Christopher Pike's ROAD TO NOWHERE is sanctimonious and heavy-handed. It's also boring, which may be an even worse crime in YA fiction. Pike deals with the subject of suicide in several of his books, but nowhere else does he come across as quite so short-sighted or lacking in compassion. ROAD TO NOWHERE is an insult to anyone who has had suicide touch their lives in some way. Pike sacrifices good writing for anvil-dropping, resulting in a sloppy plot that feels secondary to his forced message.		I recommend instead these classic Pike novels: MONSTER, SPELLBOUND, GIMME A KISS, LAST ACT, WITCH, SCAVENGER HUNT, and The Last Vampire series.
1,Like Arafat, this 'palestinian' was actually another Egyptian		A briefing by Justus Reid Weiner	September 20, 2000	http://www.meforum.org/191/edward-said-and-me		...Commentary magazine published an article by Justus Reid Weiner, a scholar-in-residence with the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, which demonstrated that the autobiographical references of Edward Said, a Professor at Columbia University, were fundamentally Inaccurate...		"In my article, I showed that Contrary to his depiction, Said was in fact NOT exiled from Jerusalem by the Haganah in December 1947.	Nor was there any basis to his claim that he "spent most of his formative years" in Jerusalem and that he "left with [his] family for Cairo" by "the end of 1947."		Similarly Said's assertion that he lost his "beautiful old house" in the Talbieh neighborhood was revealed to be False.	Actually, this avatar of the Palestinian refugees was the scion of a wealthy Cairene family.		His father was an American citizen who moved to Cairo from Jerusalem a decade before Edward was born.	Living in CAIRO until his departure to attend Prep school in America in 1951, Edward Said resided with his family in luxurious apartment buildings in the exclusive Zamalek neighborhood where he was attended to by maids and a butler.		He played with childhood friends in the manicured private gardens of the Aquarium Grotto, he attended private English and American schools, he was driven around in his father's large black American cars by a chauffeur, and he enjoyed the facilities at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the son of one of its Only Arab members.		In 1952 a revolutionary mob burned Said's father's flagship store (and a branch) to the ground, and several years later within a decade the nationalization program instituted by Egyptian president Nasser ultimately forced Said's father out of the country. Thus, the truly devastating financial losses suffered by Said's father were in NO way connected to Israel, the country from which Edward Said demands reparations.	[......]	[......]"		You can easily find the rest I hope.
1,The book was stated to be new!  This book is not new..Although in good and readable condition...IT IS NOT new as stated in description!!  I think price should be adjusted as it would cost me to return the book...
1,I think he spent 80% of the content of the book explaining who he was and his beliefs and just a small amount of time on the actual near deah experience story which was what I was interested in. You can read both apendixes of the book and thats it, that's the full summary, no need to go through the whole book.
1,On a positive note, this book provides a good explanation of how the current financial crisis developed. Published in July 2008, it necessarily misses many of the huge developments that have occurred in recent months. To be fair, let's give Mr. Zandi credit for accurately predicting upcoming problems in the CDS market - see page 230. He is also the first critic I have found that notes the role of REITs in this crisis.		However, as many of the reviews have noted, there are numerous shortcomings that seriously limit the value of this work. His ten recommendations are in most cases absurdly simplistic (with the exception of revising mar to market rules),e.g. suggesting that people get better education on financial issues. His announcement that the worst is over has also proven to be hopelessly optimistic.		Here are some of the really important questions that Zandi ignores (in the first case intentionally):		1. How could both financial rating agencies (like S&P and Moody's) and CPA auditors completely miss the nature of the correlated risks that were emerging, especially given the repeated use of off balance sheet special purpose vehicles that were much publicized in the Enron collapse?		2. What are the implications of these failures to the Sarbanes Oxley law - has this legislation done anything positive? Or should it be repealed?  What are the lessons learned here?		3. In a similar vein, what about the role of GLB ("financial modernization") law and the repeal of Glass Steagle - should this law be re-invoked?		4. What is the new normalcy that we can expect over the next decade? Zandi properly mentions that this crisis is an "inflection point" with long term implications, but he does not give us much of a picture on what the new world will look like.		Bottom line: There is a better choice that is far more prescient. Charles Morris' Trillion Dollar Meltdown - published in early 2008 -  answers all the above questions. It is also short and easy for normal people to read with zero economic training. If you just buy one book on this subject, the Morris book is the best one I have yet read, by far.
1,I never received this
1,If David Orhvall is your typical consultant, then I don't want to go into consulting.	His tone is so condescending I had to throw the book into the trash. I could have returned it, (it would have made sense given the price), but I had to symbolically chuck it to get over the feeling I had reading the nine first chapters. I can't speak for the rest of the chapters.
1,I expected 'The Shack' to be something similar to Mitch Albom's 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven', only with God actually being in the story.	Instead, I got a few chapters of a fairly interesting crime drama(considering the author is not, as far as I know, a 'professonal'), before it all deteriorated into a mix of evangelical proseltyzing and 'New Age' philosophy.	I think Young simply tried too hard to turn a simple 'spiritual fiction' novella into some sort of 'epic', meant to enlighten readers of all faiths...or no faiths.	Young's nontraditional views of God, instead of seeming revolutionary, or thought-provoking, just seemed to be too 'cute'. He lacks Albom's gift with words, the ability to make a profound point in a simple way. Much of Young's prose was paradoxically simplistic, easy to read, yet bogged down by complicated explanations of spiritual issues, delivered in a cloying, 'down home' tone. (Maybe pandering to the Oprah Book Club demographic?)	One of the more confusing sides of the story is Young's attempt to paint 'free will and independence' as the down side of mankind's failure to 'accept Jesus'. Even Young doesn't seem clear about what point he's trying to make here.	This book just boils down to another evangelical text, trying to 'save' or 'convert' people, but not offering anything really fresh or memorable.	Without giving away the ending...anyone familiar with the old joke that says that bad writers write themselves out of a corner by having the main character 'get hit by a bus', will see that idea in a whole new light!
1,Review of The Bremer Detail by Frank Gallagher		The author, a former marine, writes of his trials and tribulations in the early days of the Iraq war while employed by Blackwater, and changed with the duties of protecting Paul Bremer. George W. Bush appointed Bremer, a former Kissinger associate, to head up Iraq until a formal government was democratically elected. He was the favorite of every known and unknown terrorist in the region. Many believed that his security was essential to the potential success in Iraq. Well, even though Bremer was not assassinated, Iraq still turned out to be an enormous mess and probably will ne that way for a very long time to come, so maybe Bremer need to have Bremer security was so what over stated.		The book was somewhat interesting but there was too much fine detail that could have only been important to those in that war theater. I have read books about the Navy Seals and other unique military outfits that were heaped with self-important, chest thumping minutiae. Many of these guys were paid a private contractors to preform military duties seemed to overly enjoy their time in a war zone. Some even found extreme excited being the target in killing zones. They all were well paid and they all relished totting around long automatic guns that they knew how to shoot almost too well.		While I appreciate Gallaghers effort, his book is like so many others, written by private contractor that took place in Iraq, I found this rendition somewhat tedious and definitely redundant. It was hard for me to get through this one, but I toughed it out anyway. My synopsis of this book is that it is about many former Marines and other types of Special Forces, all acting in employment as private contractors who essentially butted heads with each other during their tours of duty in Iraq. Like I said before, to me it was just too familiar to invoke any real interest on my part.		I would rate this with 2 stars solely appreciative of Gallaghers writing effects.

1,Lord of the flies, only not very good. The characters act like they just rolled off an episode of leave it to beaver. Pretty crap writing IMO.
1,The book has no plot, too much detail.....what is the need to mention how a bow is made or a sword. Very disappointing book
1,While I am not swayed by Marx's historical perspective, nor am I swayed by his prescription for how to solve what I believe to be an overblown, if not altogether nonexistent, problem, I think that this is an important book that every American should read. Unfortunately, the last people to read this book are the ones who should read it the most.		Conservatives who march around calling Obama a socialist or a communist really should at least take the time and make the effort to understand the system that they criticize. There is enough within the actual doctrine of communism with which you may disagree without having to run around in the streets attacking straw men.		Not to mention, this book is surprisingly short. It is not very long, and it is not very hard to read. Only the slovenly intellectual mind can refuse to read such a pithy book that has had such a profound impact on human thought.
1,Few books in the mathematical literature have given me so much pain as this one. Freshman year, I took a heavily theoretical linear algebra class with Tommy II as the textbook, and then the next term I took multivariable calculus out of this book as well. In either case, this book was my first experience with the material, though as an "introductory" text it should have done the job. Suffice it to say that neither experience was terribly positive.		My problem is that Apostol never seems to try to motivate ideas well, and he uses cumbersome, nonstandard, and occasionally inconsistent notation. His proofs can be inelegant and opaque at times. He is far too sparing on geometrical intuition as a way to understand the material, preferring to talk in symbols rather than pictures. (This is especially true in the first five chapters on linear algebra. His multivariable chapters are well-illustrated, but calculus on R^n seems to be trivial once calculus on R is under your belt from a good introductory book like Larson/Hostetler/Edwards at a high-school pace. Thus, the motivation is needed least where it is used most.) As a result, I feel that I still don't intuitively understand how operators work on inner-product spaces, even after trying to remedy my deficiencies for a year and a half now.		I attributed my lack of understanding to my stupidity, but then I found myself learning exterior forms from Arnol'd's excellent mathematical mechanics book and groups from Dummit/Foote's superb abstract algebra text - and understanding the exposition perfectly. And I started to feel that this book is the thing at fault.		If a prospective reader is prepared for the terseness and difficulty of Apostol, I recommend that s/he go straight to the real math rather than settling for this obfuscated treatment of inroductory subjects. It is no harder to learn the rudiments of metric topology than it is to learn Apostol's open balls, and it seems no more inspired to take on Halmos' linear algebra classic, with its intimations of Hilbert space, than it is to struggle through Apostol's treatment. (The former seems to combine considerable difficulty with terse, but wonderful, motivation, but don't take my work on that: I'm only forty pages into it!) But the books are more inspired, and the math is far more general and beautiful.		My recommendation: learn your calculus (and potentially your first linear algebra) patiently but thoroughly from a prosaic, worked-example-ridden, 1000-page monster, then go straight to the upper undergraduate/early graduate classics for the real fun. Tommy II, caught somewhere in the middle, has no place in this plan.
1,Just couldn't get into this. Reasonable well written I just couldn't bring myself to care what happened to any of them.
1,Did not enjoy this book at all. I thought the first book was good
1,Normally I adore Kleypas writing, but this one disappointed. There was too much male chest beating, too much imposed sex (I want to impale you upon my pole right now and you will like it), not rape but more a matter of degree of imposition. There was also a lot of game playing by the women and the men who controlled them. It just didn't speak to me in modern romance terms but seemed too much of a throwback to an older style of plot and character development. I was disappointed.
1,So I need t choose a free book for July from the Kindle First Selections.  The Selections are a rigorous trial, with six books from different Genres facing off.  There can be only one.  My Genre is mystery.  I was born to it.  But I am a sexy rebel beoved by all so I challenge the Society and select a Dystopian YA.		Immediately I am seized by deja vu.  I remember the other times I sexy-rebelled into thjs Genre.  I remember them clearly because this book seems so like them.  The society is forcefully divided, like every other Dystopian; it's divisions are mathematically unsustainable as in Divergent.  Authors, take a darn math class.  The heroine is super hawt like Bella Swan, kicks butt like Katniss, is the inspiring figurehead like dude from Red Rising.		This book is like a meal at Olive Garden.  it's exactly what you went there for.  No surprises.		I keep reading because I want to be fair.  But like all the dystopian YA before it, the tale is first person present tense and i grow frustrated with the hyperlimited pov and lack of comprehensible worldbuilding.  (The Tree buildings are a ludicrous attempt to be cleverdifferent and eye-catching.)		Like any meal at OG its no better or worse than you expect and if that is what you're hungry for it gets the job done.		----	A note about the math:	If two people make two babies, they replicate their number  so the next generation has the same amount of people.  But if only one of their babies is allowed to have babies, that number is halved.  100 people in one generation will be 50 people in two generations, 25 in 3, 12 in 4, 6 in 5, 3 in 6.  By the Seventh generation the cheese stands alone.  No society is mathematically sustainable with the system this book is built upon.
1,Maybe I was expecting too much from this book and genre.  Many of these other reviews have my same issues with the unbelievable story, wooden characters, and ridiculous subplot--yet are giving it a pass due to hot sex?  The sex scenes were okay, but when it's between characters you don't find believable or really care about, what's the point?		- - - - Thar be spoilers below. . .ye be warned - - - -		I've read several other Julie Cannon books, so decided to give this a go as well.  I was able to suspend disbelief for a majority of the first third, even with the brother who is somehow convicted of murder (not even manslaughter) for accidentally killing a man who broke into his sister's house and was beating/attempting to rape her.  Maybe I wasn't able to suspend that disbelief, but I was at least able to ignore it.  What I had the biggest problem with was the brilliant plan of the main character Dillon, a bazillionaire, to marry a woman she has known a couple months in order to garner a deal for a piece of land--all to gain the love/respect of her lecherous, emotionally distant father.  Seriously?		Obviously the brilliant plan backfires when Dillon casually mentions it, perhaps while steepling her fingers and laughing maniacally, to her assistant within earshot of her new wife.  I finished it just to see how (and WHY!?!?) Callie, the poor sap in question, would follow proper protocol and take Dillon back at the end.		Somehow Dillon conveniently realizes she's in love with Callie (though again for some reason Callie had actually married her without Dillon ever having told Callie she loved her) and no longer requires paternal approval of her professional life.  By this point Callie prostitutes herself (her words, not mine) to Dillon for money for her brother's lawyer...and if there was one shred of a likable character before, they're been blown to bits by now.		So I ask again, what's the point of reading hot sex if there's no story to back it up and the characters themselves are one-dimentional caricatures?  This probably could have worked had the story been tighter or the characters and their motives been better defined or in any way relatable.
1,The story of the "Ye-Haw Sisterhood" whose members, though grown women, say things like "Yikes". If you like endless descriptions of setting and scenery, this may be the book for you. Except the author writes things like "In a stubble field there were horses - or was it cows?" Virtually no plot but some dragonfly petting by one character. Sorry but I just don't get the rave reviews of other readers. Guess I'm not into some nature- loving-sisterhood thing or long drawn-out page-length descriptions of setting, no matter how detailed.
1,Author seems to use the fact that the character is writing journal entries to excuse a lot of bad writing habits. He even writes that his old English teacher would be upset by his poor sentence structure. Why not fix the problem instead?  This sets the precedence for the rest of the book. Spelling was ok but he needs an editor or a dictionary. I'm still trying to figure out how keys can go "incognito".		All of that pales beside the totally confusing timeline. He jumps around from past to a different past and back to present multiple times per chapter. He writes of a plan to bring other people in but either never executes it or doesn't inform the reader if he did.		A good idea ruined by lazy writing. He seems to have a following so maybe the writing improves in subsequent books.
1,The Veil is one of the biggest disappointments of the year. I was looking forward to getting a fresh start with Ms. Neill since I tired of the Chicagoland Vampire Series after that ridiculous nonsense with Ethan. I really loved her YA series, but for some reason the publishers and author decided not to complete it. I was hoping that this book would be as intriguing as the early Chicagoland Vampire books, but it was not. There was so much description that I was bored to tears. I actually fell asleep once while reading this book, and it was the middle of the day! I read until the end, hoping that something amazing would happen, but I was let down again. This book had a lot of potential. Unfortunately almost none of it was realized.		Claire was a pretty dull leading lady. Of course we had a grad student (linguistics instead of English this time), but Tadji was Claire's best friend. Claire didn't stand out much. She could supposedly fix things, but I didn't see her put a single thing back together successfully. Gunnar was the token gay friend, and Liam was a really boring love interest. Sure he's a bounty hunter and that should make him bad ass, but he was just meh. I liked Tadji the best, to be honest, but we didn't get to see a ton of her.		There was so much description that the pacing was thrown completely off. For some ungodly reason, Neill felt the need to describe every speck of dirt on every single block. And if we happened to return to the same block, she'd describe every speck of dirt AGAIN, like we hadn't just been there 5 pages ago. I get it. New Orleans looks like crap because of what happened. I didn't need it beat into my head by 2-3 page long descriptions every scene. I started skimming over the insanely long descriptions after the first 75% of the book. I just couldn't take it anymore. Not much really happened. Basically boring Claire and dull Liam ran around in circles looking for wraiths and having no chemistry. What happened to the steaming hot sexual tension between Merit and Ethan? Did Neill use all of that up in her other series? There was absolutely nothing between Claire and Liam. Maybe if Claire had quit gawking at her surroundings like some redneck tourist and paid attention to Liam instead of analyzing specks of dirt, things could have been different, but that didn't happen. The ending was so uneventful that I don't even remember it, and I finished the book last night.		Overall I did not enjoy this book. I know that a lot of people seemed to like it, and I'm sure that those of you who like tons of description and world-building will love it, but the novel just wasn't for me. I think I'll be skipping this series.
1,This was my first Danielle Steel novel, and unless someone can convince me that the writing is totally atypical of her style, it will also be my last.  I very much wanted to like this book, but that was not to happen. I was attracted by the plot/story line - I immensely enjoy reading about women past their twenties and thirties who have lived and battled life, and struggled through, coming out stronger in the end. My biggest obstacle with "Country" was the simplicity of the sentences, with unnecessary repetition of what was written earlier in the paragraph, and way too many sentences and paragraphs beginning with the word 'and.' I honestly felt like I was reading a story written by a teenager telling me a tale, rather than letting the characters act it out. I kept putting the book down to read something else, consequently it took me over a month to finish. Had it not been a Kindle book, I feel sure I would have edited it with a red pen - instead I just cringed and kept googling up the author's name to make sure that this was the person who had written so many popular books. Didn't even categorize it when I finished, but sent it straight to archives, never to be seen again.
1,Didnt really do it for me.  Too much drama and although the main characters were in their early 20s to early thirties, they came across as really immature.	** Spoiler Alert **	Its like the author tries too hard to make everything extreme.  Savannahs parents are country musics number one singing duo. Savannah is 23 & somehow landed a position as assistant editor for Envy, one of the worlds most popular magazines.  Of course the job was one of the most sought after positions in L.A. and a 23 year old gets it.  Not only does she land this coveted job, but her boss constantly tells her how amazing Savannah is and how she couldn't imagine making it without her.  Savannahs boyfriend Logan is 32 & has his own modeling and acting agency.  Hes such a catch all the models hate Savannah for bagging him.  When she finds out hes been cheating on her & she breaks it off, she just wants solitude, but its hard when all the models are selling their stories to the tabloids about how they all slept with Logan in the past.		Savannah is working with the editor on the biggest issue of the year, The Most Influential Men of 2012 & meets Kayden Knox.  Kayden is a 26 year old billionaire oil tycoon and business entrepreneur.  Of course, hes the sexiest man on the freakin planet.  Wait, I thought that was Logan? Kayden knows right off the bat that he just has to have Savanah is his bed.		Author overuses dramatic words in inappropriate places to try to set the scene.  Examples: Youre lucky I love you so much or Id have to ruin that pretty face of yours. I spit at him.  (This was a scene where Savannah was laughing & joking around with a co-worker.)  And What the f*** just happened? Brooklyn spits out through clenched teeth. (This was a scene right after Savanah accepted Logans marriage proposal, before she found out he was cheating.)  Spitting words didn't seem appropriate in either situation and were too dramatic for the situation.		If you can relate to squealing, giggling, hissing, spitting girls and guys who scream and yell everything, check this out.  Otherwise, Id pass.
1,I was disappointed in how the story ended.  Good build up but the ending was flat.  Needed more intrigue and excitement.
1,I was really looking forward to reading this book and 30 pages into it, I was extrememly dissapointed.  It is so informally written in such a simple way that I felt like it was meant to be a kid's book.  Her constant smiley faces and other emoticons, exclamation points everywhere, and way of trying to talk to the reader (e.g. pretty bad, huh?!) is awful.  I have been watching Days for 10 years now and thought this would be more about her life and the things she has dealt with then about her giving cheesey advise.  At times, it acts like a self help book encouraging the reader how to be the best person they can be.  Book wasn't worth my time so I simply stopped reading.
1,Very dull, no plot and no story
1,If what you're looking for is a theological treatise on tithing, then "Tithing", by Douglas Leblanc, is not the book for you.  However, if what you're hoping to find is a book about practical ways tithing was implemented by various people and communities, then this may be what you're looking for.		In the early pages, Leblanc admitted that he learned a valuable rule in his journalism career: "It's not about you."  Using that rule, "Tithing" takes a story-telling, journalistic approach than a teachy-preachy one.  It is less "why" and more "how".		"Tithing" is book 5 in the "Ancient Practices Series" by Phyllis Tickle.  It is only 152 pages long with a short study guide at the end, so it's not a book one would spend a long time reading.  All the stories seem to follow a similar format, so it makes for a quick read.  In preparing for the book, Leblanc toured the country interviewing people involved in various organizations asking why tithing was important to them.  But each chapter is a story of it's own; the chapters don't build from one to the next.  Instead, readers could realistically pick up the book, choose a chapter, skip around and there would be no confusion of information by doing so.		Personally, the story-telling model did not appeal to me.  I got bored very quickly with the book, and had I not agreed to read it entirely in order to review it, I most likely would have jettisoned it at the end of chapter 1.  In fact, after finishing the 2nd chapter, I set the book on my nightstand and remarked to my wife, "I hope this book gets a lot more interesting pretty quickly."		On a positive note, what the stories/chapters brought out is the fact that there are faithful people all around the world doing great things for God's Kingdom with His money.  We seem to find ourselves admiring people like this, yet we are reluctant to live as exemplary as they do and give as deeply.  It is a wonder how the world would look today if we spent more of our time and efforts praying and giving?  It is clear that the model in the Old Testament intended tithing as a means of providing for the poor and needy.  The same theme emerged in "Fasting", by Scot McKnight, when he directed us to Isaiah who taught that fasting ought to lead us to giving.  At the very least, "Tithing" has opened my eyes to seeing giving in a little bit different light.		LIKES: I did like that Leblanc cited others efforts and organizations, giving practical ways we can give above and beyond a simple offering plate.  He not only cited those organizations, but also provided web links for readers to get involved in their efforts.  My favorite chapter was #10, "Do They Tell Such Stories About Me and You?"  In that chapter, Leblanc interviewed Rabbi Yisroel Miller.  Miller pointed to some strong support in the Torah for tithing.  Unfortunately, Leblanc didn't accentuate these points.  He simply allowed the chapter to die with the conclusion of the interview.		DISLIKES: Very little scripture was used or taught throughout the book.  I would have liked to see more of an authoritarian teaching on biblical giving, rather than an "anything-goes" method.  Also, it seemed far too often that the people telling their stories tithed because of how it benefited them.  Chapter 4, entitled, "Earnest Money", contained the story of John Schwiebert, whose view of tithing was summed up in this way: "If you become a member of Metanoia, you agree that tithing is the platform in which you enter into membership."  To him, "the tithe [was considered] earnest money."  I don't think the Bible's intent for tithing was for it to serve as a membership fee as though one paid a monthly or weekly membership to the fitness club.  I would have liked to see Leblanc challenge some peoples' faulty notions of tithing.  They could have served as teachable moments.		You'll notice I haven't quoted much from "Tithing".  That's because in my opinion there wasn't much to quote.  Overall, I give "Tithing" 2 stars out of 5.  I think he put a lot of work into interviewing people of various organizations, but I didn't see him expounding on the teachable moments.  I don't think I could recommend the book because I was honestly disappointed with it.		Disclaimer: I receive books from Thomas Nelson Publishers (Booksneeze) free of charge in exchange for my unbiased opinion of them.  I am not threatened or rewarded in any way in efforts to encourage me to provide a positive review.  All opinions are mine.
1,Wasn't what I thought it was.
1,I tried, I really tried. I enjoy Jill Kargman. Odd Mom Out ...enjoyable series. The Ex Mrs. Hedge Fund...very amusing beach read. Predictable, but good. Arm Candy , however, was mainly used by me as a sleeping pill. Turning forty , and I have, was for me, just hitting my stride. The protagonist , Eden , was a total pain. All I ever wanted to yell at her is "grow up and grow a pair". She is a self centered, narcissistic , intellectually stunted shell. An affair with a young, wealthy , uptight twenty something, formulaic and dumb. I wish I could say something really positive, but rarely do I dislike every character as I did in this book.  Don't bother buying a copy...you can have mine...really. Good luck...I expected so much more...like some entertainment. We aren't tackling "War and Peace".
1,I really dislike giving a 2-star rating to this book. I WANTED to like it, really I did. But it's not a great book. Many of the quilts in the gallery are pieces that I have seen in other books I own. I have always liked many of these quilts - key phrase: ALWAYS LIKED.... as in have seen many, many times. Nearly a fourth of the quilts are five or more years old, and in this information age, that's a long time. As for the techniques section - if you have the Snippets books or the Painting book which Cindy co-authored, you already have about half the techniques. Some of the other techniques (Angelina, photo transfer) are shown in better detail in the Quilting Arts magazine or other books, and two of the "techniques" are just basic traditional piecing with perhaps a slight twist toward contemporary (for ex, stamping on sashing fabrics).		All-in-all, if I'd seen it before I ordered it, Amazon would still own it, and I'd still have my money. Unhappily, it's now the other way around. I know a lot of work goes into writing a book, but these authors should have put their efforts toward a better project. The best thing I can say is that the gallery photography is good (the projects photos less so). And if you don't own many exhibit catalogs or other books on art quilts you may really enjoy this one.
1,Why is it that histories of technology are all inadequate and inaccurate? It is easy to find, from many sources, the exact order of battle at Gettysburg, but not why  appliances in North America require 120 volts (AC) as opposed to double that in the rest of the world. "Empires of Light" by Jill Jonnes is an ambitious book, and it covers more than simply the bizarre War of the Currents between Edison and Westinghouse. It's a general history of electrical technology until about 1907, and it is highly detailed and descriptive. The book has much to recommend it, especially a profile of George Westinghouse, who, among industrialists in the age of the Robber Barons, was a remarkably admirable man. (If only there were more like him today!)		Unfortunately, this book is flawed in three ways, and although I'll keep it on my shelf, I can't bring myself to review it with any enthusiasm.		(1.) We in the USA like to think that everything of any value was invented here, by patriotic (white) Americans. (Ask your friends and neighbors where the automobile was invented, and they'll no doubt say America.) So it is that, from page one, Ms. Jonnes gives absolute and unqualified credit to Thomas Edison for being the sole inventor of the incandescent light bulb.  The more one researches the matter elsewhere, it becomes apparent that Edison invented nothing, and there were many light bulbs made by many different men for at least fifty years before Edison first tried his hand at it. Many of these bulbs had carbon filaments, and many of the carbon filaments were made from bamboo fiber. Most were vacuum bulbs. According to Gavin Weightman's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Industrial-Revolutionaries-The-Making-of-the-Modern-World-1776-1914/dp/0802144845/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Industrial Revolutionaries: The Making of the Modern World 1776-1914</a>, "The use of [Joseph] Swan's lamps in Godalming in 1881 was the first practical use of the modern light bulb."  But the name of  Englishman Joseph Swann is absent from "Empires of Light" as an inventor, and the name Swann is mentioned only in passing when the Edison Company had to merge with the Swann Company in the UK so as to avoid infringing on Swann's patents for the light bulb.		Why has Edison been given so much credit for inventing the incandescent bulb? According to Weightman, at an electrical exposition in Paris, Edison's lackeys bribed the judges comparing the merits of various bulbs to choose Edison's bulb. (Highly plausible, considering Edison's knavery against alternating current.) Also, Edison was a tireless self-promoter, eager to impress gullible people (such as Ms. Jonnes).  In his endnotes, Weightman adduces some impressive sources, but Ms. Jonnes seems to have gleaned all her information from a recent laudatory biography of Edison.  Ms. Jonnes makes no mention of the development of the modern tungsten filament by William Coolidge of GE in 1910. In the matter of the origins of the light bulb, you can find, at many web sites (including Wikipedia), far more information and far more accurate information than in this poor book.		(2.) I am certainly not among those who hold that those of the distaff side are incapable of understanding technology, but this is the second book by a woman that I've read recently (the other being&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Brilliant-The-Evolution-of-Artificial-Light/dp/0547520344/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Brilliant: The Evolution of Artificial Light</a>) which garbles the fundamentals of electricity. On page 19, Ms. Jonnes speaks of both "positive and negative" electrons. On page 62 we learn of lampblack being "carbonized."  (Will graphite one day likewise be "carbonized"?) On page 70, there is a diagram of an "Ordinary Parallel Circuit" in which the voltage drops as the wiring gets further away from the source. This is not particle physics; this is tenth-grade science, and someone should've told her that the voltage remains the same at all points in a parallel circuit. (You can demonstrate this with a voltmeter and your car. Check the voltage at the battery, the starter post, the dome light, the license-plate light, or anywhere else, and you will see that it's always 12 v. The last lamp doesn't get any less, as in her diagram.)  On page 91, Ms. Jonnes describes the *brushes* of an electric motor as "segments of copper that rotated with the armature . . .". Instead of spending so much time in libraries reading the encomia of Edison's press agents, Ms. Jonnes would have profited by going to the corner garage and inspecting a real electric motor.		I don't blame Ms. Jonnes for these errors as much as I blame the book's publisher, Random House. The errors in "Empires of Light" are nowhere near as bad as in other books, and it's impossible for anyone to get all the facts right, especially when they're unfamiliar with any technology, and that's why publishers *used* to have fact checkers and proofreaders. Unfortunately, many new books I've read in the past few years have glaring errors in them, errors which should've been caught during editing. Publishers apparently just don't care anymore.		(3.) The worst thing about "Empires of Light" is the writing. Ms. Jonnes's style is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard in print. The trend in modern popular history books is to add imagined details or dialogue or thoughts that a subject *may have* thought or *perhaps* had spoken. In this book, we get long paragraphs of descriptions of scenes, usually in cities, as Ms. Jonnes imagines them. She takes us back to the morning of July 9, 1889 by painting a picture with her words:	"Through the open windows, for it was summer, came the muted cacophony of Broadway below, newsboys yelling the day's headlines, hawkers tempting passersby with corn on the cob, teamsters lashing their horses forward."	[Sweet corn in early July?]		or		"November 15, 1890, dawned crisp and azure in Manhattan, one of those delicious fall Saturdays where the air shimmers sweetly, full of life's promise and tempered by autumnal tristesse."		Well, yessss . . . [clearing of throat] That may be quite nice for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rebecca-of-Sunnybrook-Farm/dp/1407629506/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</a>, but I don't believe that people who pick up a book about the history of electrical service are looking for the setting of a fanciful scene of "autumnal tristesse."  I doubt that even the poetry magazines are accepting such claptrap.		Ms. Jonnes adores her own words, so the more of them, the better. There is not a noun in this book which lacks an adjective. Pronouns are shorter, so each gets two adjectives. In this book	no man has a jaw; he has a "jutting jaw"	there is no mustache but a "huge mustache"	there is never wind; instead, there is a "sultry spring zephyr"	it doesn't rain; there is "a gusting downpour"	it doesn't rain; there is a "stubborn drizzle"	there is no lake; there is "glistening water"		Redundancies mean nothing to her: ". . . working largely at night when the city's much maligned street-cleaning crews spread out to remove the two or three million pounds of equine manure left behind each day by the city's 150,000 horses." [Is that as opposed to *feline* manure from horses?]  There is "squishy mud" and "powerful locomotives" and ". . . stank of horses for equine trams."		Throughout the book, Tesla never speaks in public without yet another reminder that he spoke "perfect, but accented English."		Of course, every threadbare clich that one can image must make an appearance:	stifling dust	sweltering heat	blistering heat	pelting rain	a warm sultry evening		At first, I thought, If I can make it through a book by Jacqueline Susann, I can slog through this mess, but then I kept on reading out of morbid curiosity, eager to see how many superfluous adjectives she could pile-up.	"The soaring Eiffel Tower and the amazing American wizard Thomas Edison, whose multilingual phonographs dazzled all visitors to the exposition's huge . . ." [pg. 225]		I see by the dust jacket that Ms. Jonnes has a Ph. D. from the Johns Hopkins University!  In Baltimore!  The home of H. L. Mencken and James M. Cain and Russell Baker and Upton Sinclair? Where Poe is buried?		And now this? O alas and alck!  Pity yon Baltimore! Dismay! Dismay! Fie on thee, O prolix autumnal tristesse! Begone!		But other than those three things, the book is OK.
1,I tried to get through this book, but I just couldn't.  It has a great plot....I love this genre, but it just seemed too unrealistic in the fact that they had been planning for years.  I would rather read about people unexpectedly trying to  survive the apocalypse.  You could also see the political slants in the writing....but that could have been the writers intentions.  I do like the line that said something about it being better to do all of this planning and looking foolish than yo not plan at all and the end really happening.  That's not a direct quote, but I think it is close enough.
1,I found the plot, after the initial pages, a little too easy to anticipate.  The villains were shallow characters--just evil people without much explanation or justification.  Throughout the story, the author raises sources of future conflict or main character does something that we expect will come into play by the end of the book, but then we never see it played out.  I was disappointed in the ending.
1,I had high expectations for this book...but alas it's a bust!  I try to read 2-3 business books a year.  With unknown authors I usually let the book vet itself a couple of years to get past the early cheerleader reviews.  Because of my respect for Mr Koch I jumped on this book early at the tune of $14+change for the Kindle version.  Bad decision.  If this book were a boxer it would be covering its face the entire fight!  The first two chapters dealing with the history of Koch industries were readable...good content but uneven narrative.  Choppy but interesting details.  As I read the following 10 chapters (12 total) my expectation was that the narrative would smooth in discussion of the present and recent past.  Boy, was I wrong!  Each chapter seemed to slough deeper into a trough of mind numbing explanation of the Koch holly grail MBM.  I typically read in entirety and scan little.  For this book I scanned a lot.  Frankly, if I hadn't purchased it I wouldn't have finished it.  It was a chore but the scanning did pull out a few additional nuggets.  I'm an avid case study reviewer...but by the end I couldn't even enjoy the four poorly written case studies.  Let me be clear, I don't disagree with the concepts in the book.  They seem well thought out and time tested.  I'm still a fan of Mr Koch, just not of his writing.  Not a "Win/Win" Mr Koch.  Wish I had my time and money back!
1,Before you buy this book, please go to an actual bookstore and pick it up. Turn to any page, and just look. You will find poorly-reasoned and utterly childish moralizing, delivered by an enthusiastic "war on terror" proponent who cheerfully endorses torture and unilateral violence, all in the name of "science".		Having subjected myself to the annoyance of reading this book, I now want very much to go through page-by-page and count off the childish false platitudes and mistakes in reasoning, and I will jump at the chance to do this if anyone leaves a comment here asking me to. But for now I will save you the reading time and just link to the words of the would-be ethical thinker himself.	See: [Link removed. See comments]		Here we have Sam Harris, our moral guide, telling us how the problem with torturing other human beings is how it makes us feel bad when we see how much our victim is suffering. We could, he supposes, solve the problem by inventing a pill to render our victim completely immobile as he internally suffers unimaginable pain. That way when the pill wears off we'll get the confession without ever having to feel any moral pangs. Perfect.		That's where his ideas on what "scientific" morality looks like begin, and it just carries on from there. To put it as briefly as I can, the sum of Sam Harris's moral thought is nothing new. It all amounts to plain old-fashioned power worship coupled with the identification of "what I want" with "what Science wants". The blatant war cheerleading combined with the whole business about science/human progress being "on our side" is all too familiar to any student of history, and not just of World War II era. Ambitious career-intellectuals have been touting this doctrine for as long as there have been tyrants to kowtow to, and philosophically it's been seen as the immature nonsense it is since before the time of Plato. But of course, as long as this kind of garbage remains useful to the powers that be, there will always be new "experts" to come along and proclaim it.
1,I don't think the main character could be any more stupid or unlikeable. She is so rude and horrible to her supposed love interest. She acts like she hates his guts every time she is with him, but then is dreaming about kissing him and jealous of other girls. It's so annoying!! I am 50% in. She has finally admitted to herself that she loves him. Finally, I thought, we are getting somewhere! So in the next sentence, she determined to be even MORE "closed, careful, and unmoved". I could have screamed. Really?! That was the whole first half of the book!! I finally stopped. I can't keep on in the same vein.		Also, there is a LOT of attention given to the fact that Nathan stares at her all the time, even before he knows her, which is pretty annoying. I can't fathom why he likes her.		There are many mentions of different places that took me a while to know their significance to the main character. That was pretty confusing. Also, there is some sort of mystery about her mom and Nathan's dad and her dads horse farm, but nothing is being brought to light ever. They just keep talking about it, and I can't bring myself to care.		I also have no idea why everyone is so anxious to know her, after hearing her cousin talk so much about her. Or, why they cared to continue courting her acquaintance.		If you want to read a good regency romance, I would highly recommend Julie Klassen or Lawana Blackwell.
1,Actually, I didn't read this and don't plan to, having watched the PBS "docudrama" produced up in ultra-liberal MSP. Just saw it on YouTube though a link. So in a way this is by extension, a review.		  I always read the most critical (i.e. negative) reviews because I tend to find them more revealing, if not any more objective, balanced, or accurate. In this case, those with regional defenses are particularly entertaining, if not intended to be amusing.		  From some of these including the coinage, Knoxville, and the former Chicagoan Big Mac fan, one might conclude that Blackman (what an ironic, some may say an appropriate name) gives the APPEARANCE of being a very successful... (is fraudulant too strong a word?), writer and academician. There appears to be an abundance of these in higher learning: I've known a few myself. If some of these reviewers have any faults the key one is that they go on way too long and their reviews turn into tirading essays. Although if they can defeat  Blackman with numerous verifiable facts, "right on" (so to speak).		  I will give Mr. Blackman credit for showing me something historical I did not know. And overall, it appears to have been a shameful process. But he seems to seen it also as an opportunity to exploit it as a "new" find and expose it to the liberal world in America in particular to make fame, relative fortune, prestige, honor showering, and the good life all around. A rather common practice, one might think.
1,This piece of annoying fluff was neither epic nor historical, considering there was no grand story and not a single historical event noted. The characters lacked depth or interest and all problems were solved by facile solutions.  Ridiculous romantic notions were rampant, coincidences were contrived and adolescent. Even the geography was wrong. It was ridiculous to conceive that the sisters would have arranged travel for their orphan from Bergamot to Marseilles via Venice !!  The war scenes were superficial and trite, reading like a twelve-year-old's history essay (with apologies to all twelve year olds). And gnocchi is not macaroni. Sheesh!
1,A Downer -- Very Depressing Book.  I read this partially because Bradley talks briefly about my uncle and a lot about my hometown.  But mostly, I read it because I'm a LSU Football fan.  I did enjoy some of the material; however, the book is hard to get through because the majority of the book discusses Bradley going through major bouts of depression after he leaves the LSU football team.  Further, I'm not sure what Bradley was trying to say here -- it's some kind of a love/hate relationship whereby Bradley occasionally praises his LSU football experience, then rips it over and over again.		Every man who is worth anything goes through very hard, life-changing experiences -- and yes -- depression usually goes hand-in-hand with these experiences.  However, if you continuously look back and get depressed over it, it will bring you and everyone around you down.  And I'm afraid this is what happened to Bradley.  He just couldn't get over himself with regards to his strange LSU Football experience.  Real Men get over things, and move on.  If you cannot, you should seek counseling to do so.  And writing a book about this depression and your inability to move on is just not a good recipe for a sports book.  It's a mismatch.
1,I never ordered this!
1,This book is just the worst piece I have ever seen written on this subject. There is no specific information that would educate or prepare someone for long range shooting. The coverage of firearms is just a listing of what guns and cartidges are available from major manufacturers with little offered regarding applicablility. The rest is just a collection of mundane stories...sort of like watching bass fishing on TV.		The author is contradictory from one chapter to the next, bascially wandering from one opinion to another as the book goes on. At one point he suggests the 7mm Remington magnum is a great selection for chuck hunting, after suggesting the 223 Remington and suggesting the 22-250. My favorite quote was "Recently, the 300 Winchester magnum is getting some attention for long range shooting" or maybe ""The scope is the eye of the shooter for long range hunting".		The author opens by ridiculing the opinion of someone who selected the 17 Remington for long chuck shooting, but later goes on to post data for the 17 Mach II and 22 LR cartridges. By the time he was done recommending, he had even included the 30-30 WCF and 50 BMG for long range sport shooting. I'm not trying to me mean. I am sure the author is a nice guy, as are his buddies, services and suppliers he covers in this work, but then I was charged $16 to read this tripe. Was the book inspirational in some way? Yes, it pretty much means I have a chance of publishing my work on hobbyist neurosurgery.
1,When I start reading a book, I always finish it but I have to say this was hard work finishing this one.  It is full of incest, foul language and really not worthy of someone's time.  There should be a rating on this book warning readers about the contents.  I love thrillers but not like this.  It breaks all moral boundaries and then some.
1,The movie was better.
1,I really could care less for this book. I really wish I wouldn't have wasted my time on such a depressing book.
1,This book is difficult for me to follow. I did not enjoy reading it.
1,More ideological lies and misrepresentation  from a hawk who loves the New World Order views of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and their banking friends and allies on Wall Street.  It is all an argument that boils down to seeking capitalist profits for the war machine and the corrupt financial sector.  Slaughter has no respect for the international law concept of sovereignty either.  She supported an illegal NATO-backed and Bill Clinton endorsed war against Kosovo that was subsequently used to justify and illegal, immoral and unethical war against Iraq under George W, Bush.  In short, Slaughter has "slaughtered" the basic tenets and principles of human rights, international law, and US obligations under the UN Charter (to which it is a signatory)..  This book could only be published by the Naval Institute Press because no other publisher could justify such a piece of ideological neoconservative crap as worthy.  So, Slaughter and Richard Hass can have their little party of warmongers at the CFR and try to influence another group of mindless neoconservatives to create a global police state that---as she outlines it--- sounds more like fascism.  I am sure that anyone who is familiar with the Nuremberg Principles would condemn this work as a mere updated version of Third Reich thinking.
1,The premise of How to Marry a Highlander might have made a great full-length book but we'll never get to know.  I have my suspicions that the author chose novella length in what is becoming a popular ploy to get readers to pay for teasers for their next book. Because the story presented here is told, not shown, and told briskly, leaving out what might have been interesting facets.  It was like sitting around a campfire with friends but instead of a ghost story I got this regency instead.  Of course, there was a nice long excerpt for the authors next work and the writing there seemed a bit more up to par.  Trouble is I feel cheated when authors choose this route and I felt especially cheated by this story.  I'll be very careful about spending any of my hard earned money on this author's works in the future.
1,The 4th Patterson book I have read and this one is painful to read. I thought that the LA coroners' office was doing the autopsy on Peter's body. To believe that this man was not murdered and it was an accident was to far over the top. The kangaroo trial at the end of the book was so ridiculus that it was laughable. Hopefully, the next Paterson book will be much better than this effort.
1,I wish I'd known before picking up this novel that it had multiple lover interests. It would have been more meaningful with just one love interest.
1,This is one of the few times I've been disappointed in a Baldacci book. When the main character is unlikable, even with a dead family, you know there's a problem.
1,Just totally disgusting.
1,TOO much sex and too many descriptive words.  I finished this book but will not reserve the other 2 in the series.
1,This is the worst series I ever read.  You are all over the place.  How did thus get published.  Each time I read interaction of this book, I'm more confused, the cliffhanger is nit worth another book buy.  I'm sorry I bought all my books at once, thinking the am getting ready for a good read.  If anyone ask me was this a good book.  I would recommend the first book, but to quit while they are ahead.  Ever here the saying don't quick your day job, you need to find another profession cause this isn't it..
1,I'm a fan of the Osprey Series (New Vanguard, Duel, Combat Aircraft, Air Vanguard) and I think their quality has been constantly improving. I like them, not because their depth of analysis, but because they are handy references.	I was really looking forward to get the book since it was announced last year; I got the ibook in mid March ordered from Amazon.it The initial impression was good.	Unfortunately, when reading it, several mistakes popped up:	page 4: the Gerald Ford Class arrangement is substantially different from the Kitty Hawk Class: CVN78 has only three elevators and is the major departure in layout since the Forrestal	page 12: the outbreak of the Korean War occurred June 25th, 1950 (not the 22nd)	page 38: the captions for the pictures are inverted	page 40/41: the aircraft on USS America are incorrectly identified (A3 and E2)	It really appears that the book was prepared in a hurry and not sufficiently rechecked. Several more mistakes are likely. Because of the above, no information the book provides can be fully trusted. The book fails its main purpose in being an handy reference for this specific and interesting subject.
1,The storyline sounded so interesting that I ordered all three books in this 'set'.  The first one was ok, but I couldn't get through the second at all.  Ended up throwing all of them away as I couldn't even pass them off to my friends as I do with other good reads.  The characters were just strange, not at all like the other good vampire romances on the market today.  All the sex scenes were the same, she just flip-flopped the characters.  To be fair, I did try to read another of her story lines - Fairyville - and found it to be lacking as well.  Ms. Holly has a large fan base according to the posted reviews, but I will not be joining those ranks.
1,Just awful. Read all the other one star reviews, they say it all.
1,I'm a Mason. A 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason (Valley of Joplin) AND a Shriner (Abu Ben Adhem) in fact. I also go to a Southern Baptist Christian church most Sundays. I have never seen any "bible" used other than a Christian bible in a lodge, period. In NONE of my degree work was the name "Satan" "Lucifer" "Devil" or any other variation thereof used, let alone "oaths" sworn thereto. In fact, religion and politics are not talked about in lodge at all, both of them are highly discouraged. Lodge is meant to bring men together, not cause quarrels talking about religion and politics. You must profess a faith in a "God" of your own choosing. It is up to each individual's personal convictions as to what God that is. You are never asked to embellish on that, it's a private matter between you and your God. How many Christians go to work? Most of them do not know most or any of their coworkers religions I bet. Yet they still work with them. Same with the Masons. I don't need to know your religion in order to work with you. If you want to talk religion, go join a church of your choosing as well, it is highly recommended in fact. If you want politics, go be a campaign supporter. No, it's not strictly a Christian organization, neither is it an anti-Christian organization either. Men of ALL faiths came come together. The branches of the US military have men of all faiths in them, and look what they can all do together!		Most "Christians" spend their day driving to work listening to anti-Christian musical lyrics and come home and sit in front of their "alter" watching anti-Christian t.v. shows for hours on end, on their way to the anti-Christian movies at the theater, while neglecting their own families with Facebook or Pinterest or other insipid "social" (anti-social) websites, which are anti-Christian.		As the bible says "get rid of the plank in your own eye, before you worry about the dust in your neighbor's eye".		I thought the same thing but I had courage enough, and originally joined the Masons to find out for myself, not trusting books such as this or "Illuminati conspiracy" websites.		If this guy was such a good and concerned Christian, he would have a website warning everyone for FREE, not charging you $25+ do so but only if you buy his copyrighted book. So, he's only concerned with making a profit, NOT warning people. "The love of money is the root of all evil" the bible states. It also states "there will be wolves in sheeps clothing", yet how many Christians are duped and lap up books like this, or yet worse believe men like Osteen, Hagee, Hinn, Popoff, and others, all who's messages in part or in whole, are NOT biblical. Again, televangelists and book writing "Christians", are only in it for the dollar. If they were real Christians honest about it, they would find a way to get their message out for free. I guess enough people also blindly believed David Koresh and Jim Jones and that Heaven's Gate dude. We see where blind faith got their followers!		Anyway, there is your dose of logic about men who write "books" like this, and my own personal experiences in all levels of the Masonic organizations. The only way that you can prove me right or wrong, is to go join for yourself. You can't trust books such as this OR my word. Only by joining will you find out and prove that I am right.
1,I only read the first few pages of the few chapters Amazon provided here. That's all I believe I need to read, in consideration of the title, to offer a position on the value of this book in terms of bringing more information to the victims and the public he violated. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the irony of the title of the book. My reasons are partly the same, but with another consideration.		People who commit the most horrendous acts continue to think of themselves in a positive light and to represent their acts or intentions as good. Even some murderers, rapists and kidnappers have claimed they committed their acts out of what they thought was "best" for the victims. There is no limit to what a self-interested criminal will use to claim goodness in his/her own character. For Sandusky to have believed himself so Christlike (because I also noticed the similarity to the title of the television show starring Della Reese, and consider it more than a coincidence) that he apparently named the book in reference to the lives he "touched" was arrogant. It reveals, in advance of his crimes coming to public light, a far reaching attempt to paint himself into a scenario of "do gooder," rather than an honest interest in providing community assistance to vulnerable children. The foreshadowing of justification, rationalization, insidious character defect and the ultimate crime revelation suggested by this title couldn't have been more targeted if it had been in the hands of an expert fiction writer.		Attempts by anyone to show the world his/her own "goodness" are suspicious, and in this instance we now know why. This second sentence in the first paragraph of the second chapter written by Sandusky is ironic indeed: "I had always professed that someday I would reap the benefits of maturity, but my lifestyle wouldn't let me."
1,A book that meandered on with long description making it hard to get involved in the story line. Although quite well written the book is not a light read.
1,I was looking forward to reading this book as the author was born  into a fascinating family and moved in some rather heady circles. Her aunt was Lady Diana Cooper for heaven's sakes and her Grandmother a member of the Souls.  Unfortunately this book is vaguely nostalgic but without any substance, certainly with no new insights.
1,I will say the concept is very creative. Every detail of aliens and the invasion was very well thought out.  Anyone who is a Sci Fi fan and is into Dominate man/Submissive woman would like this book. It isn't my cup of tea, it's a little dark for my tastes. The Characters weren't likeable. Mia is very weak and indecisive and she pretty much annoyed me the whole time. The Alien is a jerk, flat out plain and simple, he's a Creeper. Also since I'm not into Aliens and Sci Fi much the extra details and deep explanations of all that was boring for me and I just skipped through to the parts that interested me. As I read I coulda cared less about the humans or aliens because I didn't connect or like any of them. The situations between to 2 lovers were also very awkward to read. It's all very borderline rape and not very sexy or romantic.
1,I've not seen it. Got it for my sister. She really likes it. Would probably give it a four or five star rating.
1,I tried to read it. In fact I picked it up about a 10 times thinking it must get better since it did have good reviews. I finally gave up after 4 chapters which were hard to get through. Of course books are a personal preference.
1,I'm going to start this review with some back story. In October of this year, John MacArthur hosted a conference around the subject matter of his then unreleased book Strange Fire. The conference and the book were meant to discuss the charismatic movement and to affirm the Person of the Holy Spirit. The conference set off a firestorm. Charismatics, particularly of the Reformed variety, were offended, and MacArthur's faithful followers were quick to defend him and the conference. As the story unfolded, I tried to keep up with some of the follow-up commentary. I was intrigued and more than a little disturbed. To me it was one more public display of Christian infighting. And the biggest question I had was, "Is it worth it?" When I then saw that Thomas Nelson was offering this new book as a selection for their blogger book review program, I decided that I needed to read it for myself. I've done that now, and I must tell you that I've never dreaded writing a review as much as I do this one. But here I am, nonetheless, jumping into the fray. Because I think it's worth it, but maybe not in the way MacArthur would have hoped.		Strange Fire is subtitled "The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship" though that doesn't quite encapsulate the whole of the book. The book is divided into three main parts but really the first two can be lumped together. They both focus on discrediting charismatic teaching. The last part focuses more positively on what MacArthur calls the Spirit's "true work." The book ends with an open letter to continuationists and then an appendix full of snippets of "Voices from Church History."		I'm almost not sure how to start my critique. I'll start with the positive. There are parts of part three that have value in understanding the work of the Holy Spirit. And that's all the positive I can offer.		This book is terrible from start to finish and for a variety of reasons. I honestly cannot believe that this book made it to publication. I have read a number of MacArthur's writings and have always come away with a better understanding of whatever topic he was tackling. They were always edifying. Which just adds to how utterly disappointing and even enraging this book is to me.		I'm going to set aside for a moment any question of who is right and who is wrong on the topic. From a rhetorical standpoint, the arguments set forth in this book fall into any number of classical rhetorical and logical blunders: straw men, red herrings, ad hominem attacks, confirmation bias, false dilemmas, hearsay (gossip!), and so on. It felt as if I couldn't get through a page without encountering one such error. That is unacceptable from a scholar such as MacArthur, especially on a topic so potentially divisive.		When I read any work like this, one of the main questions I try to ask of the author as I'm reading is, "What is he trying to accomplish?" I still cannot answer that for this book. It seems like MacArthur never answered that question for himself because the book tries to do to much and ends up undermining itself in the process. For instance, MacArthur focuses much of his attack on men that most conservative charismatics would condemn also (e.g. Benny Hinn) but then lumps all other charismatics into the same group, even as he calls on them to confront these abuses of their theology--"You should be condemning these evildoers, but really you're just as bad as they are."		That brings me to my next issue with the book. The tone is inciting and divisive. As I mentioned before, the main part of the book ends with an open letter to continuationists, appealing to them to quit the error of their ways. But this appeal comes after 250 pages of calling them charlatans, evildoers, false prophets, and more. I can't imagine but that such an appeal would fall on numbed (from verbals beatings) ears. And again I ask, "What's the point?"		Having said all these things, let me assure you that I'm trying to be unbiased here. I consider myself Reformed, but this is the kind of book that makes me not want to tell people that. And though I consider myself Reformed, I have no convictions on this matter of the continuing gifts, one way or the other. I've done research and searched Scripture and find myself no closer to knowing what I believe. And I'm unwilling to accept the cessationist point of view on the authority of men. I had hoped that this book would lead me further down the path to understanding, but it didn't even a bit.		Here's what I wish this book had done. I wish that it had clearly laid out the work of the Holy Spirit from his point of view, with all the Scripture there to back it up. Or I wish it had focused on the dangers of abusing charismatic teaching. Or I wish it had raised a clear and loving call to charismatic brothers to confront abuses among them. But again, it did none of that.		At the end of it all, I can only recommend reading this book so that you can see for yourself if I'm right or wrong. Beyond my own better understanding of this incident in our church history (the fighting due to the book and conference), I don't feel as if the book was worthy of my time and effort in trudging through it.

1,I have been reading Mr. Burke's books for many years, and have tired of their dark, self-pitying, re-hashing of damaged characters; and predictable plots, whether in Texas or New Orleans. So, with all due respect to a talented writer, I am retiring from his readership.
1,This is a very bizarre book. It has its entertaining moments but it became so disjointed as to lose believability. First, we start off with one villain for about a third of the book and this villain is totally over the top. He is a Bosnian after an American photographer who took photos of his war atrocities and he kills anyone in his path. Then we abrupitly shift directions but with the same hero who now is obsessively tracking the movements of a film starlet from the thirties whose photographs he discovered in the home he just bought. This has nothing to do with the Bosnian or any of the people the Bosnian killed. Meanwhile, the hero has lost all of his friends because the Bosnian killed them. He is down to just his ex girlfriend vs a vs the movie startlet who would be nearing 100 if still alive. And it just gets weirder from there. I was half expecting the last third to turn into a ghost story but it did not. If this had been two or three different books, there may have been one good book there.  There are enjoyable parts but the whole is a mess.		Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

1,After such classics as "In an Antique Land" and "The Shadowlines," Ghosh's latest book is rather a let down, much like "Circle of Reason."  In "The Calcutta Chromosome," the characters are not well developed at all, and they all seems so contradictory, especially Dr. Murugan, who carries much of the burden of this book.  Part science, part science fiction, part  mystery, the story becomes less compelling when doused heavily with the technobabble of science and computers (the latter is very unrealistic, even for a futuristic fantasy.)  Simply put, it detracts  from a potentially interesting story. Even the concept of the Chromosome and it's omnipotent possiblities is not developed enough to make the title a compelling one.
1,I was looking forward to it, but the writing is dry, and seems to be a rehash of every other rule of leadership.  I didn't learn much, and after two chapters I returned it.
1,It's not that I don't like this book as the star rating implies.....it's the departure of the author's insight from the contemporary view of this anomaly to the religious.  There are many people who have had visions of compelling future events due probably to the "fly past" of this planetary body.  It's when certain people tend to interpret these cosmic events as "God" inspired that, in my opinion, undermines their credibility.  If people are really interested in learning about this phenomenon, devoid of any religious context, I would highly recommend the following book:  "Earth Changes and the Human-Cosmic Connection" by Pierre Lescaudron.  Richard.
1,i knew who the killer was from the moment the killer showed up. I was hoping it would be some other major twist to make up for the sophomoric writing and shallowly drawn characters, but nope. I understand that there are bad thrillers. I've read a few. But i have never read a thriller this bad with this much marketing behind it. I really wanted to like it, as my brother sent it to me, but i ended up skimming it, something i never do with books, because it was that juvenile. I was so dismayed that there was no big twist to make up for the long trudge through it. I will have to put a good spin on it for my brother, though. It was thoughtful of him to send it.
1,Kevan owns a marketing firm and Mason works for a PR firm both are fighting to sign the hot new band 'Manix Curse'. They meet each other, like each other and end up having a one night stand.  Unbeknown to them they are both fighting to sign up the same band.		Unfortunately, I found this story to be very predictable, main characters meet, sleep together and find out they vying for the same thing. I did feel the characters had great chemistry and attraction but it wasn't enough to save this story.  There were no surprises, no excitement, everything happened as I thought they would.  I was hoping as I continued to read that maybe I would be wrong but nope it was predictable.		* ARC PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR FOR AN HONEST REVIEW *
1,Not much of a plot.  Confusing story line with a lot of flashbacks.  Lacked Stieg Larsons flair.
1,Boring. Inside pictures are all in black and white.....not color! Pictures are dark too. I would not recommend this book to anyone, ever. In your ad..please state the pictures are in black and white!!!
1,Very little thought went into writing this book.  It is a jumble and to be avoided.
1,This collection of stories has an extremely loose Christmas theme holding together disparate stories about sex and romance.		THE CHRISTMAS PRESENT by Lori Foster	This story is about a young woman, Beth Monroe, who is on her way to her family's hotel in Kentucky to escape a personal drama. She broke off her engagement to a doctor, Brandon, when she discovered him with another woman. In order to get back at him she decided to sleep with Brandon's best friend, Levi Masterson, but got more than she bargained for. Her expected quick fling with Levi turned into a hot weekend and now she is so embarrassed by the way she let herself go that she's retreating to her family at Christmastime.		Unfortunately for her equilibrium, Levi is hot on her heels, trying to persuade her to marry him. With various family members giving advice, Beth and Levi spend some time at the hotel talking and continuing their hot sex as Beth tries to get her head round events. Did she really love Brandon? Hasn't she always been aware of Levi as a very special man? Brandon appears at the end of the story and, in a rather weak-seeming plot development, decides that Levi is far more deserving of Beth anyway.		This story was reasonable but it seemed to lack any genuine power or emotion and there wasn't enough really holding the plot together to make it a satisfying read. The principals' behaviour also didn't stand up to real scrutiny with Beth using someone else for sex just to pay back Brandon and a 15-year friendship apparently chucked away at the first opportunity by Levi. The additional characters, various brothers and parents, also added little to the story - I imagine they have featured in previous stories by this author but their contributions were largely spurious here. 2 Stars.		IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE by Karen Kelley	This is another simple story where we are introduced to handsome playboy actor Jeremy Hunter. Unfortunately Hunter is about to lose the part in a film because his playboy reputation is making the producers worry that he can't authentically play the part of a travelling preacher. In order to prove to them he can play the part successfully he agrees to spend a week as a travelling preacher and to prove that people will believe him.		At the end of the week he ends up in the small village of Two Creeks where, after spraining his ankle, he has to stay for a few days whilst he recovers. He's lodging in the guest house belonging to a young school teacher, Bailey, and he finds maintaining his cover as a preacher more and more difficult. When things become serious between them he runs off before being dragged back to face the music by her relatives.		This is another simple story with rather too many unlikely events to make it believable. Hunter was clearly at a loss in his role of the preacher and yet people seemed to believe him in the village. The denouement scene was rather unsatisfactory and I wasn't sure that Hunter's reform would last. All Bailey seemed to see in him was his physical appearance - after all, he lied to her and didn't have much else to recommend him rather than money. 2 Stars.		HOME FOR CHRISTMAS by Dianne Castell		This was a very strange story. Two people whose relationships have just broken up meet in a gazebo on a snowy winter's night and start having sex within about five minutes, promising that it's nothing serious, just a meeting of the dumped. However the man, 'Handsome' as Lulu dubs him, finds he has to stay around to make the most of all the events planned for his wedding which was called off the day before. Apparently his family want to go ahead with the non-Wedding and, even more bizarrely, apparently they have decided Lulu is right for him and should become the new bride (although they don't tell him this). Lulu has decided she doesn't want to get involved with a man who travels and 'Handsome' (otherwise known as Sebastian) is a soldier about to be deployed. Lulu and Sebastian, between bouts of sex, decide to matchmake two members of Sebastian's family but find themselves unexpectedly married. At this point it was impossible to stretch credulity - the sham marriage was completely out of order and in no way legal but they seemed to think it was. Anyway, eventually all is sorted out but in such an unlikely story that I found myself relieved to have got it over and done with. This was definitely a disappointing and unrealistic story. 1 Star.

1,Please, let me say that first and foremost, I adore (nay, worship) the Harry Potter stories.		Secondly, I wish to say that I deeply admire, respect (and am quite envious of) J. K. Rowling's skill, her achievements, and the long and heroic struggle she has triumphed over to get where she is today.		Thirdly, I am so very happy that Ms. Rowling has chosen to put her fame and fortune to work helping children. I have -always- said that children are the -most- vulnerable, as they have little voice, or rights of their own to protect them.		Now, having said this, and with the understanding that the "Tales of Beedle the Bard" was a plot device used in HP7, And Never Intended To Be A Book In and Of Itself...		This book really stinks.		Flip through the reviews. First eliminate those of the rabid fans who would worship Ms. Rowling's grocery list, if it were made available for purchase. Next, ignore the "Was This review helpful" rankings, as the first group mentioned probably went though and clicked "No" on any review less than 4 stars.		O.K., now look at those 3-stars & under reviews. They've said it all:	This thing is -really- short, and the words spread out to try and "pad" it (I read it in 20 minutes); The stories might be entertaining if read to a pre-schooler, but not to anyone older; and most sadly, the stories AND commentary contain none of Ms. Rowling's great skill, nor do the parts attributed to the character Dumbledore sound even remotely like how I perceive he would have written them (Little humor, no "spark").		Some negative reviews I chose to discount involve either criticisms of it being "Dark" or "Scary", and "Inappropriate for young children" (reviews written without taking into consideration how dark -most- fairy-tales are, and the fact that kids today are far too wise (on average) to be frightened by this book), or complaints of rushing something out in the name of capitalism.		Point is, the book sales go to a very worthy charity, AND this book was only intended as a "cute" gift Ms. Rowling made for 6 of her friends, with the 7th being auctioned off for charity.		And on THAT note, I wish to recommend that instead of buying this not-very-good-at-all book, you should look into making a donation directly TO the charity that the "Net Proceeds" would have gone to, namely: The Children's High Level Group, which you can find using any good internet search engine. This way 100% of the $12.99 goes to a worthy cause.
1,Tales My Body Told Me is a bit of a jumbled mess. There are several elements thrown in on a very meandering road that eventually leads to a point, but by that time I had forgotten the purpose and direction of the book. There are flashes of excellence amid the chaos and the author's unique voice and beautiful prose shines through. Unfortunately the entire plot feels directionless with long rambling scenes that seem to have no point and offer little to the story itself. The characters seem to lack any definition and the main character is inherently unlikable. All of this combines to make the story seem as through you're reading through a fogged lens, never quite sure what is reality and what is not.		The story starts with Paul living in some kind of a halfway house. His memories are disjointed and he can't quite remember how or why he got there. The home seems to be a very small, private recovery center for gay men that want be straight. There are 4 other residents and the overseer. Paul struggles to make sense of his day to day life with memories flashes of his past. The story follows Paul as he indulges in graphic, frequent day dreams about sex with other residents which may or may not have happened. At the same time, the story gives glimpses into Paul's past and how he came to be at the recovery center.		The plot from the summary sounds interesting and the concept of mystery surrounding a recovery center for gay men has a lot of potential. In fact I read the book as soon as I got it. Unfortunately the mystery aspect is not a main driving force nor is it very well defined or executed. The mystery is convoluted, improbable, and ends up with a really silly resolution despite the strong premise. The mastermind, which is no spoiler to tell you, is an incredibly old man that can barely talk so the entire resolution at the end seems just stupid. Not to mention there are long rambling scenes that does nothing to promote the mystery nor really advances the book at all. These tend to be filled with anonymous sex, random insights, page after page of the main character's self indulgent whining.		Part of the problem with the book is the main character, Paul. Paul is well defined and constantly given time and attention to develop, but unfortunately he's not a very likable man. Paul destroys his relationship with his partner for no real reason nor does he even recognize his actions and their consequences until afterwards. He spends the entire space of the book crying and whining about his predicament, which he himself causes and does absolutely nothing to correct or better. He lacks any motivation, insight, or courage to take charge of his life. He is content to drift in the wake of others' and let them direct his life. He maybe regrets his actions but it's difficult to assign that emotion to him since he mostly pities himself more than anything. The book also makes a point of describing just about any and every unflattering characterization to Paul so much that I had no idea why his partner would do the things he did.		Beyond an unlikable narrator, the pace is very slow. Like I've said the story reads like a winding, snaking road with a destination at the end but no strong direction to get there. The writing has moments of sheer brilliance which shows the author's skill. These shine in the quiet moments of great descriptions, the chilly Maine coast, fearful scary basement, and the emotions of the characters fleeting in their experiences. With a more strongly plotted story, this book could have really shined. Instead it languished in unimportant scenes that offered little to the whole. For example there is almost an entire chapter devoted to the characters as they watch a scary movie. There are no additional insights offered to the men involved, or the mystery in general. This is just an indulgent chapter showing the closeness of men and seeking each other out. Similarly, there is a lot of sex between all the men, pretty consistently and regularly with very little out of emotion but steeped in shame and convenience.		Without a strong focus, the scenes seem too arbitrary from sex to flashbacks to elements of mystery. Perhaps the book is meant to be a glimpse into the mindset of those that seek out such recovery centers, but none of the characters ever delve into that possibility. Perhaps the book is meant to be a mystery, yet the mystery is almost unimportant and given the least amount of attention and focus. Perhaps the book is meant to look at the mistakes and missteps of an older man, struggling through life and that comes across but in a very unflattering, unappealing manner. Either way I didn't enjoy reading this unfortunately even as the moments of real skill kept me carrying through to the end. I'd definitely check out other offerings by this author - in fact I really loved his Report from Winter - but this is not one I can recommend.
1,Do Not buy this KINDLE edition. It does not contain any of the commentary, or verse notes that the paper versions do. It is a waste of your money. Spend the few extra dollars and buy a leather, or hardcover.  Hopefully, I will be able to get a refund.	UPDATE: went onto livechat, and spoke to a rep. No hassle about the refund. Removed the from my kindle
1,almost every character too self involved.  Sad when not too much love or compassion for main character's Mother .....
1,Wasn't for me, have book similar to this one.  Had wheat and other grains in recipes. Not totally keto.  Actually returned it to Amazon. Made trying to get into ketosis and staying there more difficult.
1,I love pride and prejudice variations. I've read a lot of them. This one was just boring. There was no romantic tension or even endearing love. The dialogue was trying to be formal or elegant but came across as long-winded and needlessly pompous. I just didn't like it at all. Again, I love P&P variations. This one didn't feel like P&P at all. Aside from the names, it was unrecognizable.
1,What a worthless POS this garbage is.  Do NOT waste your money and let this shameless, greedy, media whore, so-called "Rabbi" profit!  (And guess what:  he writes that he's planning a SECOND BOOK on Jackson conversations having to do just with his views on children.  Ca-CHING!)  I took it back to the store after reading it for a full refund because I was deceived by Rabbi Smelly Buttocks.  I was led to believe that this was a true transcript of the conversations between himself and Michael Jackson.  Instead, he claims that Jackson's responses are intact, but that the Rabbi has edited his own questions and comments.  Therefore, we don't get an honest presentation of the communication between these two people.  Jackson isn't here to edit his own raw comments, but the Rabbi had the opportunity to present HIMSELF in the best possible light, all the while assassinating Michael Jackson's character throughout the entire book.  Isn't it great, Rabbi, when you can present only one side of a story from a bully pulpit, with no danger of challenge from a dead man?  And where's the signed agreement from Jackson -- or any kind of proof -- that he wanted you to turn these conversations into a book LIKE THIS, or even that he KNEW that he was being taped, and for such a purpose?		Also, the Rabbi repeatedly contradicts himself, saying several times that he doesn't think Jackson was guilty of child molestation, and then several times implying that Jackson WAS possibly/probably guilty!  Make up your mind, Rabbi, and base it on the facts, as can be found in the books "Redemption" (for the 1st accusation) and "Conspiracy" (for the 2nd accusation).  (Note to readers:  the Jackson bio "Michael Jackson:  The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story" is a trustworthy book and is also highly recommended.)		Since when are holy men of God out for fame and money?  This "Rabbi" claims that Jackson had a messiah complex, yet it is the Rabbi himself who brags and clearly has an ego 10X that of which he accuses Jackson.  He also provides his nauseating interpretations of everything Jackson says, instead of letting the reader draw their own conclusions, and often the reader interprets Jackson in an entirely different and far less sinister way.  This only exposes the Rabbi's intent to impugn Jackson's reputation.  The Rabbi apparently believes that thoughts can be hidden, but they cannot Rabbi!  What you were thinking is blared across every page, even though you clearly failed to realize it.  We know both your character and Michael Jackson's character by the words that appear on the page, and it is not Jackson who comes out looking worse.  In fact, many of the things of which you accuse Jackson more accurately describe yourself.		The Rabbi insists that we MUST see Jackson as "tragic" for our own "redemption," and he condemns all of us for pursuing fame and money.  What a load of crock!  Jackson is a beloved American hero who was far closer to God in his heart than you ever will be Rabbi, and the only thing "tragic" about Jackson is the betrayal that he had to put up with from "friends" like you.  And we don't need any moralizing from a lying Rabbi who says he broke off his relationship with his "famous friend," when, in reality, it was Jackson himself who severed ties after the Rabbi was found guilty of misappropriating large sums of money from the charity that he and Michael created.  Also, the Rabbi repeatedly notes that he served at Oxford for 11 years; what he doesn't mention is that he is now BANNED from Oxford!		Finally, after having the gall to dedicate this shameful piece of commercial exploitation to Jackson's chidren (!) and badmouthing their father throughout the book, he saves his worst ammunition for a blistering 30-page character assassination at the end; even in the final two pages titled "Thank You" to Jackson, he STILL jabs the knife in several more times.		This Rabbi has no shame, and this book is garbage.  Save your money.
1,Parker has a lot of ideas about how men are, um, penalized for their manhood, and she presents them with what is most politely described as verve.  But her argument suffers from two major flaws.  The first, her lack of data and of credible citation, has been covered in mainstream reviews.  The second is still more fundamental: if manhood/masculinity is innate, how can it be taken away or diminished?  And if it's not innate, then what's wrong with reconstructing masculinity (and femininity) to reflect the changing needs of our culture?		In sum, this is not a book to change anyone's mind.  Those who already agree will find it reinforcing, while those unconvinced will shake their heads at its overstatements.
1,Given that Jemima's father is who he is, her primary reaction, followed by many actions were not that of an intelligent, young woman.  The book is difficult to swallow when based on nonsense.  Otherwise, I really do enjoy Anne Perry's works.
1,Haven't finished reading and not sure I will.  The man was a hero but I didn't care for the writing style.
1,This book reminded me too much of an old Harlequin romance.....woman rescued by a man with money and a jet setting lifestyle.  It was a yawn from start to finish.
1,So depressing.
1,I have read a lot of different books, but this book, I couldn't even finish. I had heard so many good things, but I found myself re-reading the same page as I was retaining the information. I was very flat and way to descriptive. Beyond going in full detail to be honest.
1,the space part i just couldn't get into but the romance part was a nice story. liked the relationshipsin the book & learning about someone but then it would buzz kill when he would talk about his home planet
1,Just barely entertaning
1,I didn't finish it.
1,I gave it a two, I did not care for it at all. Too boring for me to keep reading.
1,I might have paid $1 for it.  BUT even that was a waste of my money.  I thought it 'might' be Christian based.  It isn't.	I could NOT get past the 1st chapter - it included several curse words but even when I ignored them, I couldn't get into the entire way it was written - I just could NOT get interested.  Too shallow, Too nothing.....		I read a great deal and can't remember Ever not finishing a book (even when I wasn't interested) and I've never put down a book after just the 1st chapter.. - Even when I ignored the curse words - I still couldn't get into it - the way it was written.  So Boring!		I've read a few comments that called the characters - quirky -  AND that is definitely part of why I did not like this book.	BORING & UNREAL characters.
1,Miramounts Ghost is a historical fiction novel by Elizabeth Hall.  It is told primarily from Adrienne but some have the POV from characters.  I got a copy of this for free on Kindle First.  I like to try new types of books with it.		The story takes place in the late 1800s in France and America.  I had no prior knowledge about Miramount Castle.  It appears well researched.  I was hooked for about 86%.  Poor Adrienne!  But the last 14% made me ill.  Then end was not for me.  I realize that it was a ghost story but there was no resolution for me to feel comfortable with the ending.
1,Yes, Mayor Giuliani performed well in the hours and days after 9/11.  However, he also failed in a number of key aspects - eg. public safety communications gear did not do the job, fire-fighter leadership that he chose made HORRIBLE mistakes (this does not in any way diminish the valor of the men that responded and lost their lives that day), and he then allowed firefighters to take turn the tragedy into a financial windfall that helped nearly bankrupt the city.  (On the other hand, Giuliani had already pretty well accomplished that with his poor leadership vs. city employees in general prior to 9/11.)		Crime did decline considerably, however, during Giuliani's leadership.  A plus, perhaps?  Sadly, not nearly as much as one might think.  Giuliani should be credited for moving William Bratton into the Chief's position, where Bratton's new methods had a fast impact.  Unfortunately, Giuliani could not tolerate competition for adulation and soon forced Bratton out.		So what are we supposed to learn from "Leadership?"  Basically a bunch of trite, overworn sayings such as "Surround yourself with great people" (the Bratton episode notwithstanding), "Have beliefs and communicate them," "See things for yourself," etc., etc.		Leadership cannot be learned from one who is good only at symbolism, but not operations, nor from reading an overly simplistic book.
1,Sloppy. I really hope that this isn't ANOTHER series that's become so popular that the author has become complacent about it.		I disliked the little, sarcastic comments by Mercy at the start of each chapter. I saw no reason for the story to be told out of chronological order, requiring these comments to break the third wall to explain where they fall in relation to one another. In fact, if seemed to me as if Briggs just couldn't be bothered to clean her timeline up. I found it jarring that the whole book, except one or two small snippets were from either Mercy or Adam's POV. Those sections felt out of place and lazy. And honestly, I just wasn't all that invested in the story as a whole. We didn't get to see much of the pack. Adam and Mercy weren't together, so we didn't get any of their byplay and it never settled into anything truly engaging, compared to past books in the series.		It's still better than a lot of urban fantasy on the market. But no where near as good as early Mercy Thompson books.		Note: I borrowed it from my local library.
1,Could be the least suspenseful murder mystery I've read. The interaction between the psychopath and the female cop is almost comical. There was absolutely no tension or drama at all. To say I was disappointed is an understatement
1,I must have missed something - I have always heard of what a great thinker Mortimer Adler was and wanted to read his books.  I got part of the way into this one and was very perplexed - it seemed to be just truisms that anyone would know.  It was clearly written but so simple it almost seemed condescending.  I'm sure all the other positive reviews must have found something I missed.
1,DIDN'T LIKE IT
1,This book was such a huge dissapointment for me, maybe mainyl because of the high stantard Bowden himself established with the fast-paced, nail-bitting "Black Hawk Down".		Another factor maybe the rush to have it published so soon after the events, when some sources would surely still be closed.		Anyway, this was a good introduction summarizing some basic facts about the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.
1,The premise of this book is very interesting, but the execution is terribly weak. The author's point is that as long as the governments of the Middle East don't provide economic growth and the potential for upward economic mobility, they are giving the religious fanatics in the region an opening to wins the hearts and minds of the next generation.		But the author's examples are hard to follow and even incoherent at times. They also reflect his past as a Wall Street Journal reporter in that he speaks only to the wealthy elite or people who are trying to become rich through entrepreneurial ventures. He doesn't speak to anyone genuinely impoverished or without hope, nor does he speak to anyone doing social services to help the impoverished masses. The result is that we don't really know if the mass of people believe that Muslim fundamentalism is a force for good or evil. We only know that people who were trained in the West or who are trying to build economic ties with the West are fearful of the fundamentalists -- and we sort of guessed that already.		The book also suffers from the way that reality can turn predictions on their head. For example, the author's introduction, which he wrote in late 2004, promised oil at $20-30 per barrel for decades to come. In fact, he said that low oil prices would probably be the straw that broke the back of the corrupt, inwardly focused Arab governments. Well, oil is now $130 per barrel.		In the same introduction, the author promises a representative democracy in Iran in about a decade, led by pressures from within the country's middle class. Today, it looks more likely that we will have a U.S.-led military attack than we will have a homegrown democratic movement in Iran.		If you want to read about the modern history of the Middle East, there are much better sources available, despite the author's admirable "I was there and talked with people" efforts.
1,This was painful, but after 500 pages I marched on.  My reward was saying I finished the book.  Williams can sure write, but there was no character I even cared about.  The story is dull, long, and uneventful.  Next to Outerworld this is a red headed step child.
1,There were some strange uses of apostrophes that bothered me.  I couldn't figure out if it was the author's style or mistakes in the transcription of the book.  That, plus the fact that I am really not interested in WW2 novels, resulted in my not finishing the book even though it is a classic.
1,The story of Oogy was very moving.  It was amazing that a dog could overcome so many obstacles and even live, let alone be a pleasant animal.  What I found frustrating what the amount of background information in this book.  It was to pg. 93 before Oogy even came home to live with the family, and by that time, I was rapidly becoming bored.
1,Nothing new.
1,I chose this book because I do like reading about foraging for food and getting back to nature but what I found in this book was an earthy approach to writing and a predilection toward hunting vs. the gathering part.  While I am not a vegetarian, I just cannot get into killing animals that should be roaming out in the woods.  I find it distressing thinking about a magnificent buck being on my dinner table.  I guess, I should have known that this book would have a large component of that subject matter but I guess it just did not dawn on me.  I did enjoy the parts about his eating his lawn so there were some redeeming content for me.  I think that those who are into hunting and the more manly adventures might like this book a whole lot better than I did. I think this is one of those books that should be left to the saying of "to each his own."
1,My mind must work differently than some of the other reviewers!  I just didn't find much humor in this book and by midway through I was considering not even finishing it...which is a no-no for me.  I was getting tired of his self-indulgence.
1,After reading the Darkness Chosen series (which were fantastic) I was excited about reading her new series The Chosen Ones, unfortunately I should have saved my money. This series is off to a very bad start. I don't have a lot of time on my hands since I am a single mom, I work, and I go to school, so when I do have time to read I want to enjoy what I'm reading. This time I was totally bored. I really thought the second book might be an improvement but sadly it wasn't. I am a huge fan of Christina's and I even got my boyfriend to read her books but sad to say these two books Storm of Visions and book 2 Storm of Shadows I would not recommend. The characters lack passion (and I'm not talking about sex) and they lack substance, I'm sorry but I just could not connect with these characters. The only one of the group I hold out any hope for might be the Wilder grandson but I'm not sure I want to risk paying for a disappointing story again.
1,While the first three books in this series were fun, this book is terrible.  I'm currently 62% of the way through the book, and the enemy has yet to surface.  There is no conflict.  Further, the characters are completely two dimensional and undeveloped.
1,I found this book very simplistic and not as broad in subject areas as what I expected.
1,What I hoped would be an interesting fantasy time travel story turned out to be a paperback romance story.  I would have liked to read more about the interaction with fairies. If you like candy cotton love stories, then you will enjoy this book.
1,I don't understand why the parents don't support their boy? I wouldn't tell my boy that the carrot will not grow. Tell him the importance of weeding and watering. Ok, I hate this book!
1,Expect results to vary by user!  Poor results on our execution.	one, two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
1,I've watched him on C-span three times this weekend.		He is a tool of the theocrats and economic royalists who think they still own this country.		His arguments are puerile.		His critique of Jeremiah Wright is nonsense: everything Wright said was true.		Liberation theology is well founded in theory and in fact. In the land of liberty and justice for all, "uppity" black men have been lynched and assassinated within our lifetimes. Unemployment, under-education, and incarceration are multiples higher for blacks.		Black Americans built the economies of the South, funded the great estates, the banks and the agrarian economies with their blood, sweat and tears.		King Cotton and Big Tobacco would never have existed without free black labor.		America has a long history of racism, militarism, and imperialism.		Anyone who disputes these well documented, historical facts is either a racist, naive or a dupe of the intellectual midgits on religious right.		[...]
1,The book appears to be a larger book in the picture and also lets you thinkit would be like the regular I Spy books where you look for multiple pictures on each two page opening.  However, it is more like a story with the ABbC's being the two or three letters in each page and having some thinkg that starts with that letter on it.  Very boring to my 3 yr old grandchild who has been doing the regular I Spy books.
1,Unfortunately, I couldn't get through this novel. The story line didn't seem to be well planned and seemed to always be missing information.	If you want to hear more of what I have to say, visit [...]
1,This is supposed to be Christian historical fiction? OK, yes it is fiction. Yes it is an interesting plot, just _not_ in an historical or a Christian sense.  OK, it does not go into anything directly immoral...but I have a higher standard than what is used in this book. Yes, the story line is pretty good...until you get to where it degrades romantically, morally, and historically:		(vague/generalized spoilers follow)	-1 star because in my opinion a Christian romance would actually follow Christian principles and not have the guy seriously toying with the girl and her heart when he was "only being friendly". That is just a despicable thing to do. Since when is that romantic?	-1 star because I like my *Christian* books to do more than mention God perhaps once and include a preacher (especially one that does things that I don't think a real preacher would do like actually put a man into temptation's way). Christian books, to me at least, actually include Christian spiritual principles and Bible verses.	-1 star because to be historically accurate, I highly doubt anyone would encourage a girl to be as compromised in that era as this story would have it. I have read lots of realistic westerns. Also, this story is missing the most common self defense tool there was. The author would do well to read a number of Louis L'Amour westerns before delving into this era again.	-1 star because, while the storyline had great potential, it really degraded by the end. To actually use physical force on anyone, even a friend "for their own good", to enter a situation they are uncomfortable with or in an uncomfortable manner is just morally wrong.
1,I picked up The Girls because of the meticulously crafted marketing campaign, and only finished because it was a selection for my bookclub. A string of fragmented observations in lieu of a formidable style choice. Neither coherent on the page nor through the audiobook I ended up switching to in order to finish it while multitasking. The nothing jump of La Croix in my throat.		The Girls was a complete miss for me and I am curious to see why someone who loved it LOVED it (and not because it was in exchange for an "honest" review... by the way, I bought the book). I'm not sure if it felt rushed, something the publishers wanted to print before Cline, God forbid, couldn't be marketed as a young up-and-coming novelist anymore? Did the author's age appear impressive despite or because she wrote the novel so young (for the record, in my opinion, touting an author's young age ends up becoming an excuse for bad storytelling, rather than anything else). This is all before the hackneyed pseudo story of the Manson murders... Of all events to happen in modern "true crime" history, why pick the most well known murder of the century? Not to mention, completely remove your main character from it and pretend teenagers decades later would bother to care the character was my even peripherally involved in the event?	Having suffered through the end of this so you don't have to -- don't even bother. If you want to read about the girls involved with the Manson family, find a biography instead.
1,Title: Ariel	Author: Donna McDonald	Series: Nano Wolves, #1	Publication Date: February 2015	Genre: Paranormal Fantasy	My Rating: 2 Stars		Overview:		Despite her sharp scientific mind and her degree in bio-molecular genetics, Dr. Ariel Jones hasn't figured out how her life changed so much in a single day. Before she can blink and ask about what is going on, shes being shot with a billion nanos and some very potent wolf blood.		Now she can suddenly turn into a giant white wolf with the blood-lust of a starving animal.		My Review:		I was given a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a honest review.		If I had to describe this book in one word, it would have to be 'bored'.		While the idea behind the main characters' transformation into a wolf was intriguing and not something I have seen done before, I just found myself entirely bored with the whole book. It just didn't have that extra 'bite' that I was hoping for. Instead, it came across as very monologue-ish and entirely distant.		Too bad, because it was a fine idea.
1,Never even bothered to finish it. And that never happens.
1,The historical back ground for these novels is really good - but I find the writing disappointing. I think that at some stage you have to wind down one story and move onto something else
1,I really enjoyed Sue Margolis' Spin Cycle and was sure that I would find this one as entertaining, enjoyable, light-hearted and so forth.  Instead, I was deeply disappointed, struggling to finish it (it's an honor thing, finishing books) and missing the humor and sensitivity I found in her other work.	The story revolves around a married couple with children in the midst of serious problems given the husband's hypochondria and the wife's subsequent feelings of neglect.  For an article she's writing, the wife embarks on a series of love affairs simply for the sex and the novel follows her through the events and their repercussions.  Although the premise sounds as though it has potential, it was in the execution and character development that I found the problems, aside from the fact that the story is also predictable.	The central difficulty for me was that I didn't like the characters at all.  The husband's obsession with health was more than eccentric and the manner in which he addressed it ludicrous.  On the other hand, the wife's affairs were so fraught with disaster - and little humor - that I found her equally repugnant.  So little is written about the children - and practically nothing nice - that I wondered why they were there at all, while the supporting cast seemed merely there to move along the plot.  While Spin Cycle was genuinely funny, I cringed at many of the attempts at humor here.	I know Margolis has written a much better book and perhaps that's why I'm so unforgiving.  It wasn't that the writing was bad rather than that the subject was a waste of her skills.  And I couldn't help feeling as I read it that the disasters that befell our heroine were the typical punishment rained down on unfaithful females, while the man, whose behavior was truly abominable, made it through relatively unscathed.  What could have been an interesting tale of two people equally at fault ended up a sort of morality fable.  If you must read Sue Margolis, start with Spin Cycle - she really and truly can do much better than this!
1,Heard CLEAVING (Hachette Audio), written and read by Julie Powell . . . if the name sounds familiar, it is because her previous book--JULIE & JULIA--was turned into a popular movie with the same title.		Don't look for that to happen twice. This true story is a rather strange tale of a woman who has a "thing" for butchers that she compares to the way other women feel about firemen. So she leaves her home to take an apprenticeship at Fleisher's, a family-owned butcher shop in the Catskills, where she finds a sympathetic group of "meat hippies" who are willing to train her.		At least I found that part somewhat interesting, though it went on for way too long . . . and then it went on to include the author's trips to exotic locations where she sought still more butchers.		What bothered me was how she treated her husband . . . she kept living with him, but at the same time, she was sleeping with a lover . . . he also had a lover and after a short while, I found myself not caring for either her or her husband.		Perhaps the only good thing I found out was that the author is now into therapy . . . good for her, especially if that activity and her butchering keep her from writing anything like CLEAVING.
1,It is hard to discern what the real story is about after almost 100 pages.  It takes too long for the reader to decide what the story is about.
1,More of an environmental rant.
1,Slow, confusing and weird for the sake of being weird.  Don't waste your time
1,It is a good thing that I borrowed book from the library and did not actually buy it as I could not finish it. I did not even get half way through the book and when I lost intrest in the characters and what happened to them.  I made my self read until I got to the half way point in the book but could not finish it... the story has been done before and a lot better then this.  I had such high hopes for this book. but was greatly disapointed.
1,They should place a disclaimer on this book that post partum mothers should not read.  Between my post partum hormones and the schmaltziness of this, I was a slobbering mess.  I will never again read it, as it upset my daughter to see her mama upset.  I also agree that this is borderline obsessive/stalkerish and brings helicopter parenting into a new light (no helicopter mom can be as hovering as this one).  I understand the sentiment, but think its better for middle America than in the coasts.
1,Didn't finish book
1,While the New Interpreter's Study Bible in hardcover is actually a pretty good study Bible, this CD-ROM version is a pain to use.  The interface is clunky, there is little documentation included with the software, and you can't install the whole program on your computer's hard drive - so every time you want to use it, you'll need to hunt up the CD and put it physically in your CD drive.  With only the New Revised Standard and King James versions to compare, you might as well face the fact that this is a one-version, very limited Bible study software.  Having the dictionary included is not much of an incentive.  If you want to do serious Bible study using your computer this is far too limited in scope, and if all you want is one version of the Bible it is actually much faster and easier to use a printed copy.  Overpriced, too, for the amount of content you actually get.  Try BibleWorks for the really ultimate Bible study software, which is more expensive and also takes some learning to use, but once you've learned to use it you have a truly powerful tool with dozens of Bible versions in English, the original languages, and many foreign languages, as well as multiple reference works integrated in the program.  Don't buy this one.
1,I read half the book and I am having trouble tracking Odd Thomas between his thinking vs. reality.
1,I did not enjoy this book at all.  It is the first time I have read this author and it will be the last.	Anyone reading her stuff I wish you luck.  So many characters and they were all over the shop.  Most confusing and a very convoluted plot.
1,Ok this is frustrating. Not only did the Kindle sample not have any text in it, NEITHER DID THE BOOK when I downloaded it so I had to return it. I read the sample on Google Play and LOVED it...so what is the deal?
1,I struggle with where to start with this horrible book so let me	say only this: About 1/2 way through the book, and for every single page after that, I really, really wanted to kill Scott myself. Deserves a zero or at most 1/2 star. Confused and chaotic plot. Unbelievable behaviors! Very odd characters!  This was just awful!!!!!
1,Finally  sat down to read and was not impressed.  Could not relate to it.  Hard to invest in the characters.
1,Volume 3 of a six volume series. See series review on the Reality Dysfunction: Emergence page.
1,40 pages. This pamphlet provides very little information. The paper is low quality. The print is hard to read. There are no diagrams or examples.
1,I found this to be a little light and not too compelling.....sort of chick lit, but not even quite there. I guess I would say I wouldn't really recommend Ito anyone.....maybe a newly divorced woman might identify
1,My vision did not see depth in this story. I don't choose to give it more of my words or time.		Shel.
1,I am not one to shy away from big fat books.  I've read plenty in my time:  Angle of Repose by Stegner (531 pages), Acheron by Kenyon (736 pages), and even War and Peace by Tolstoy (1,296 pages).  So a measly 848 pages should be no big deal.		But I just couldn't do it.  I bogged down in the first two hundred pages and never recovered.  These books are all so similar.  A gorgeous, horribly tortured (physically, emotionally, or mentally--take your pick) but essentially good man finds The One, but is convinced he's unworthy.  After much hemming and hawing, The Man and The One finally get together just in time for the world as we know it to reach some sort of crisis.  The Man saves the world and gets The One.  Everything that usually charms me about this series did nothing but annoy me this time around.  I think I'm ready to say goodbye.
1,I like info and stats so this was not the right choice for me.  This book contains a lot of subjective talk.  This book will be dated in 6 months.  It is a quick read.  Less than an hour to read the entire book.
1,I saw this book advertised in a catalog and was excited to see a "sequel" to P&P.  I was seriously disappointed after reading it however, when I discovered that the personalities of most of the characters were changed dramatically (and not for the better).  Elizabeth, the heroine  of P&P who is a strong and intelligent young woman is reduced to a  whiny, wimpy, angst-ridden hand wringer.  The cover of the book claims that  it is "authentic and convincing" as a sequel, but it is simply  BAD.
1,Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy are at it again. Having given us a re-hash of poor 100 year old scholarship on the historical Jesus in their "The Jesus Mysteries" (a book notable for offering nothing new for those who know where to look), they now wish to pursue their "researches" linking Jesus with "the Goddess" - and linking all this in with ancient Gnosticism and the more general mystery religions which flourished in Roman times.	And yet one wonders why they start here. Is there in this book any attempt to interact with mainline scholarship on Jesus, early Christianity or Paul? A glance at the index and the notes shows us a giveaway list of eccentric and less than uninterested individuals. One senses that Freke and Gandy didn't write this book with an open mind! Now, of course, we should not be surprised at this. After all, do not these authors accuse scholarship on Jesus of being a closed shop of Christians perpetuating their own stories? The trouble is that Freke and Gandy perpetuate theirs and they aren't particularly convincing. Maybe they should ditch their pretension to being historical and settle for writing books on spirituality.	As such their fixation with "decoding" things and telling us what was REALLY going on in various "mysteries" might have some credit. As history this book's thesis is in no danger of being taken up widely, inside or outside academia, anytime soon. "Why?" one might ask. Well, not least because this book's title is a performative self-contradiction. If they are claiming to be telling us "secrets" then how come they have revealed them where 1900 year's worth of scholarship didn't? What new evidence might they have uncovered? (None.) What we have here are two modern day "Gnostics" furthering their agenda under cover of "history". Fair play to them but don't expect many to be convinced.
1,This book is a great disappointment there is little to no real information on disaster preparedness or survival skills. Unless you consider praying to be your only survival skill needed. There is some fluff on 2012 but little more.
1,Good description of the difficulties in selling a necessary fix to American health system and the toxic political waters to be navigated to get any type of legislation passed.  Believe it fairly criticized both sides about the failures and the almost impossible compromised required.  An important explanation of this contrroversial subject.
1,I THOUGHT I COULD PRINT THE EXERCISES; WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS WHAT THE BOOKS STATES.
1,I love this writers previous work, mostly because she consistently writes about loyal heroes. This book, however, was a huge exception for me. I should have read the blurb better, so I take the blame on hating this one, I just got spoiled with this writers previous work.		 It was the age thing that ruined it for me. The hero is staying with his friend and his wife. They are throwing their 18 year old daughter a birthday party - he hasn't seen her in 10 years. Well, they see each other and immediately lust after one another. It doesnt take them long too hook up (I'm talking days here). Here is my problem. She just turned 18 - he's 30. This book would have been so much better had she just been a couple of years older. Not only does he take her virginity, but they later have sex in her childhood room, in her parents' house (her teenage posters on the wall etc.) She's also still in high school. He's a coach at her high school. They mess around at the school! I found it repulsive. Perhaps because I have teenagers? I don't know, but this one simply grossed me out. It didn't help that as soon as they started having sex she begged him to come inside of her without protection over and over. So, SPOILER ALERT...............9 months after her 18th birthday, she has a baby.		I really could not stand this book, but I'll still read some of this writers work, just not in this series.
1,I think I picked this book up expecting more.  Instead, I got a sermon on the author's reality of global warming.  And man, talk about dull.  I'm sure that crichton did his research, but this book blew.  Wooden characters, a plot line that was completely transparent and sermons in the middle.  Avoid this one at all costs.  Consider this.... This is from the man that inflicted Jurassic Park on us...
1,From the start, I said to myself that I hope this gets better. It didn't. I couldn't finish it. It was like a sy-fy channel movie.
1,I got this, as a reccomendation.		What a waste of $10.		its common sense.
1,The sample was promixing, so I bought it but was sorely dissapointed. Definitely don't recommend it, sorry!  Maybe for young adults.
1,First the writing is nothing close to Jane Austen and definitely not in the period.  The author uses modern day words to things that did not exist in the time of Pride and Prejudice...like vehicle and vans used to describe coaches and wagons!  Trust me...I looked up the word origins to confirm.  The story has a good theme but it gets abusive by continuing saying the same over and over.  Yes I know the murder and it's part mist be stated when it occurs, but then again at grand jury, then again at trial...but really change it up or throw in some stuff...not the same reiteration again again with little change.  Some twists are obvious, with a little surprise to keep me intrigued to get more than one star.  However, I hated the epilogue.  The parts to follow on with the rest of their lives was small the remaining pages were left to create a story or explanation of what happened in Pride and Prejudice...not this new story.  Already preferred the original and hated how the author decided to add her own version of what is a great book not the authors.
1,Very disappointing book.	I really wanted to like this book but Lucky is weak and not a woman you love, or can even root for. I truly did not feel Flynn deserved that train wreck. Heck, they introduced an old friend of his from childhood and I was hoping he would give up wishy-washy Lucky and go with her. They seemed like they really had chemistry at least.	I know people like the "love triangle" theme, but to me that just says "I don't care about either one of you to make a decision" and to me that's not romantic at all. More less wonder if you made the right decision.	Warning- this book describes her having sex with another guy (repeatedly) when Flynn is just 5 feet away. Author does not do beyond describing the foreplay and then "waking up together the next day"- all after she has slept with Flynn. Ick!!	I cannot imagine that Flynn will not let that hurt resurface periodically throughout their marriage.
1,While the story somewhat held my interest I believe there is not enough information available to warrant a book, perhaps a short story? I felt the book was filled with historical context,  drawn out and repeated, to the point of boredom.
1,First let me say that I thought the first two books were easily 4 stars. Well paced and interesting. But this one made me think it was written by someone else altogether. Over half the book consist of long detailed descriptions of bloody encounters - think Tarantino in text. Quite apart from being disturbing and downright boring, the glorification of violence in this book was out of character. Development of story line went right out the window and we have pages upon pages of killing, explosions, military jargon as we get a total departure from everything in the first two books. Pity really as they were an unqualified success.
1,Seriously? 184- 5 star ratings? All I can say is that they must have read something other than what I did. This book has way too much vulgarity. I realize this is an adult book, but that still doesn't mean it has to be this down and dirty. I was turned off just by the first few pages, and finally gave up on it after the fourth chapter.
1,This book is not that compelling - it seems like a dragged out short story and is just not that interesting!  The characters are ho-hum and i really didn't care what happened to them at all.  Very disappointing!  A lot of the press reviews of this book lumped it in with 'motherland' - which i am reading right now.  motherland is a MUCH MUCH better book!  it's on a totally different level.  so if you want to read about the parenting landscape of nyc - read motherland, not triburbia!!!
1,Not bad but not very much about the U2 overflights as the cover suggests/
1,Laurie's dreams had been shattered before she came to work at Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch - the ranch of rescued dreams - where broken horses and broken children encounter healing every day.  In an attempt to soothe her aching soul, Laurie reached out to save a dog in need and soon began to realize that the dog was rescuing her.		This book is a true story told through the voice of Kim Meeder.  It tells of the lessons that Laurie learns while helping Mia - a blind, mangy, skinny and stinky dog.  She begins to realize that she has been avoiding the love of her Master and it was time to start listening to His voice.  So Mia and Laurie together learned to follow and listen to a master that they couldn't see and in the process experienced a love they never imagined.		What first drew me to this book was the cover and title.  I am a dog lover through and through and thought that I would enjoy reading this story.  I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  I had a really hard time getting into the story and felt it a little slow paced.		**This book was provided to me by the publisher in exchange for my honest review.
1,**Some minor spoilers...		I loved this series when it started. But at this point, wth? Are these teenagers ever going to act like teenagers and get the romance moving?		I've read a lot of comments about the editing, which really needs work, but sadly, this book is better than many in that regard.  Self publishing authors really need to care a little more about their work if they want people to keep buying it.  But the editing really isn't my biggest issue.		This story is convoluted nonsense. At this point, my suspension of disbelief is crashing down.  It's hard enough to believe there is a team of teenagers doing this type of work.  Now their nineteen year old leader is put in charge of a school?  What??? As someone who works in a school I can tell you that would NEVER happen. Ever. The possibility, and probability, of lawsuits is staggering.  And the ridiculousness of teachers and principals being so unprofessional and spying on others while breaking laws and endangering students... Come on!  One I could believe, cause there are some really stupid people out there, but multiple people in one school? Too far-fetched.		And what is up with Volto?  Really, they have an arch nemesis? That this crack team of teenagers can't catch? Who seems to be getting more and more dangerous.  And the plot twist? Are you kidding? That would be demented if it's really going to turn out to be true.  Makes what has already happened both make sense and completely not make sense.		Generally, I can deal with a lot of unbelievable things in books because they are books and I enjoy the story regardless.  So I guess my biggest issue with this book is the characters just spend all their time circling each other, never having conversations that move the story along, so the character plot development is going nowhere.  Can we please make some kind of progress with the characters relationship? Make some decisions that make sense. Act like teenagers in love. Do something to make me want to continue this series because at this point I'm not sure I want to bother.  Which makes me sad because this series started out so promising. Maybe C.L. just needs to reduce the ridiculous number of books in the series and start wrapping up this school job they've got going on so they can work on their relationship issues. After all, that's why I'm reading this series -- to enjoy the characters and see how they work out their tangled relationship.  Can we spend more time on that? Please??
1,I only read the first 2 stories and then I deleted it from my Kindle...  Not my type of reading.  It was pretty much porn on paper - there was no "love" story and I would agree the characters lack development.  The endings were rushed - I was very disappointed...  I am glad I didn't pay for it...
1,***I really like to give books a fair shot, but this one was just terrible!! I am not in the habit of giving a book such a low rating, but this novel warranted nothing more than two stars(I am feeling generous).***		I don't understand how such a lovely premise for a novel could be implemented so terribly. It is as if the writers decided to speed write, and jot down all the ideas in her head and not bother to structure them.		I think the writer(s) noticed the success of some of the other suspense writers and thought to themselves that they could put together a book that would rival those of Dan Brown and others. That is like me picking up a paintbrush and saying, "Well hey, Da Vinci did it, I can too!" NO NO NO! The two writers have no talent and leave the reader wondering why they are even reading this trash...the side plots/stories are extremely confusing and boring and highly unlikely. The main plot is just a mess. An old book holds the key to.....well after a few chapters you stop caring.		I will let you in on a little secret. I have only put down two books in my life, Stephen King's Gunslinger and the Rule of Four(officially the crappiest book ever). I put it down with two chapters to go, this was my little act of defiance against such literary crap, I wanted to read enough to know that it wasn't getting any better and then I just put it down.		The only way that I can describe the setting and writing style of this novel would be to tell you to pick up a book that was WRITTEN for a preteen and compare it with "The Rule of Four" you will find the style, prose, and plot development very similar.
1,I couldn't get into this book. Characters were not well-defined or relatable. Way too much descriptive language. I was committed to read this book for book group, otherwise I would not have read past 50 pages.
1,I didn't care about the characters by the end of this book.  I thought they were weak, whiney.  One had stolen a piece of art from a friend's apartment.  The other was obsessed with the fear that he had inherited a disease from his father.  They were in a process of a move from New York because of financial woes, and couldn't even commit to a marriage despite the presence of their son.  I kept plodding though to the end because I am of that personality type, but folks, it never got better. Poor editing, the author kept repeating the plot line as though the reader couldn't keep up with the expected twists.  They never came, and I hope this couple never ends up in my neighborhood. I wouldn't want to spend an evening with them.  Yawn!
1,I bought it but it never appeared on my second kindle. What do i do about this? Grover J. Dickosn.
1,I was hoping many many times this story got better but it didn't, I kept skipping over parts because I had already read the same stuff! I finally reached the end but WTH, I guess it was left out!
1,I purchased this book as a time saver to hit all of the common core standards during my instruction.  Unfortunately, the activities are just lame.  Save your money.  Cruise the internet for activities or write your own.
1,Not my cup of tea, this novel is more of a tongue-in-cheek fantasy than a space opera, and is sprinkled heavily with folkloric elements. Grossly overpowered magical items solve many of Stenstrom's problems early in the story, killing any suspense that he might fail. I quickly grew tired of Holystones, the MOLLY (a necklace that allows the owner to know anything), and the NTH gun, which "can kill anything with one shot -- people, ghosts, robots, monsters, unsubstantial entities, and demons as well."		Lady Jubilee's thirtieth, two year long pregnancy made me wince every time it came up. Are the years shorter, or are they not really humans?		The writing style is easy to read. If your tastes run more to the old weekly serials that set up impossible cliffhangers only to resolve them with a wave of the hands at the start of the next episode, you'll enjoy this novel more than I did.
1,I didn't understand half of what was going on or even why. There are a few parts at the end that pick up but then I got lost again. Definitely not my cup of tea!
1,The people saying that this book contains no photo's are correct. I just read it and THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE PHOTO.		There are no illustrations or diagrams either.		 All we have here is the low quality prose of a content farmer., and...say it with me folks: a digital charlatan. But it does have a nice cover.
1,Entertaining beach or airport read. Easy to put down and pickup again. I laughed out loud several times and wished I could have come back lines like that.
1,Meh......
1,While the writing was crying out for a good editor, the story kept me going all the way to the end
1,An apology for Hillary's loss and a total waste of time.
1,I was listening to the Audible audio version and i gave up about a third of the way through; in the middle of the Chapter that followed hell night.		Up till this point, there really is no meaningful story. There are a few vivid scenes, but nothing is developed.		For example, the protagonist tries to console a very distressed pleb but he hangs himself anyway, and then the story line is dropped (presumably, it gets picked up later). The protagonist is recruited to help watch out for an African American pleb, the institute's first, and then after introducing himself to the guy, the story get dropped (again, presumably to be picked up later). The narrator meets an incredibly bizarre girl and after a couple of episodes of annoyingly trite wannabe wise a** dialogue, she announces her pregnancy and asks the protagonist if he wants to be the baby's father, and the story line vanishes, again presumably to be picked up later.		These scenes actually take up very little of the first third. Most of it is just a bunch of whining about how the institute's system is bogus, but can make a man of you if you get through it but how the narrator is a rebel who doesn't buy into it. Summary, summary, summary, summary . . . like a magazine article that's long on conclusions and short of examples. Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z.		I have no doubt that the story lines to which I referred get picked up and developed later, and perhaps there are more good ones. But after so much narration and opinions and so little story though the first 17 chapters, I completely lost interest in learning what happens re: any of them. I know an author cannot be expected to say much in the first third, but that is more than ample to at least make the reader care and for me, it didn't happen. I was curious about the culture of places like the Citadel, but based on the first 17 chapters, I think I'll just accept the author's intro and leave it at that.
1,My daughter, who is an avid reader, likes this series.  She had read the first 6 books, so I got her books 7 and 8 (July and August).  She read them and said they were not good.  She said that there was really no mystery, that they were kind of boring.
1,Growing up and even now I loved Carly Simon and her music and we are close in age.  I have a beautiful b & w "canvas" poster of her that hangs in the music area of my den.  However I was disappointed in her writing ability.  I guess I was hoping for a book equal to her music.  I didn't even finish it and gave it away.
1,I'm not sure why but I found this book to be too busy for me to enjoy.  In spite of an interesting synopsis that gave me some idea where it was going, this was once book I couldn't stay with. I felt things were all over the place and I had no comfort level.  It is seldom that I put a book down before finishing it but I put this one down.
1,Dawkins set out to write an atheist book were the reader would read being a theist and walk away being an atheist.  This book sort of reminds me of an hell fire preacher who uses the idea of hell as a means of making converts, Dawkins paints a picture of Atheists as the enlightened ones (the brights) and theists as being naive, believing in a myth and even worse by being religious they perform untold atrocities.  Same as the effective preacher, from the persuasive rhetoric there might be converts but ultimately it doesn't really address the question, is there a God.  I don't think you have to look hard to find religious people who are in fact intelligent and see all of the good that also comes from it.  (On a side note, I think its pretty apparent from human history that removing religion or God won't stop prejudices, wars, ect., sadly this seems to be part of humanity, does Dawkins not realize he's just as intolerant as the people he's complaining about being intolerant?)		At one point in this book, likely anticipating the backlash his book would cause, Dawkins discusses how he's not an atheist fundamentalist.  According to him, to be a fundamentalist you are so stuck in your beliefs that you won't change them regardless of the evidence, this sounds nice but like most of the book its just rhetoric and simply doesn't appear to be true.  He uses examples of scientists who change their views in light of new discoveries, but someone calling him a fundamental has nothing do with his views on science but his atheistic fundamentalism, which is very apparent.  Often in other negative reviews of this book you'll see complaints of how Dawkins knows nothing about Christian theology or doesn't have any understanding of the bible.  Another thing telling is almost all of his sources are atheist writers, now if you're going to claim to not be a fundamentalist and open to change if evidence is present wouldn't you at least read some theist apologists?  I'm not saying his viewpoints would be different, but it would be absurd for me as a protestant to go and only read anti-catholic literature to get a perspective on Catholicism, surely Dawkins can understand this?  Sadly that's not the case, when his lack of understanding of theology is mentioned Dawkins just replies something about not having to study about leprechauns to prove they don't exist.  This might be fine and true but if the vast majority of humanity did in fact believe in leprechauns (and had done so throughout all of known human history) then I do think you might at least try to understand why they believe.		To keep this review from getting too long, I'll just discuss a few parts of the book.  The first is the section on NOMA.  As a Christian who loves science this part of the book frustrated me, Dawkins is so concerned with his anti religious proselytizing that he doesn't really seem care about getting people to accept things like evolution (he wants them to accept evolution but only at the cost of belief in God).  I'm fully on the side of Gould where we should separate science and religion differences.  There are many Christians who accept evolution and are doing good work in getting others to accept it also, but Dawkins wants to keep pushing Darwinism as his God and make Christians think its either or, which its not.		The next is his section on the old and new testament, sadly I question if he's actually read any of the bible for himself.  The stories he mentions in the old testament seem to be only the same ones used by Julia Sweeny (someone he often mentions), and like most of the rest of the book he doesn't mention the other side of the bible showing once again a lack of knowing anything but the atheist arguments.  I'll admit firsthand that some of the stories he mentioned seem horrific now days, but some of these stories weren't meant to be used things to do but moral guides.  Take for example the horrible story of Jephthah, who promises to God to sacrifice whatever/whomever meets him first if God gives him victory, the person turns out to be his own daughter and he then sacrifices her.  This story is terrible, but its not meant to be taken as what to do, but instead of what not to do (in this case make rash promises to God), elsewhere in scripture human sacrifices are strictly prohibited (and would have been prohibited here).  I'm not going to go into most of the other examples but I think any reader of the bible would be advised also to read about hyperbole and its use in the bible.		Dawkins also makes an absurd assertion that "Love Thy Neighbor" was strictly for the Jews as neighbors, but Dawkins clearly forgets later when Jesus is asked but who is my neighbor the extremely popular story of The Good Samaritan.  The Jews at the time hated the Samaritans, and the purpose of the parable was to show just how much thy neighbor was all of humanity not just the Jewish ones.  He also must have never read Deuteronomy where the Israelites are constantly told to treat foreigners well because they themselves were once foreigners in Egypt.		Dawkins ended the book discussing just how limited our knowledge and perspective is.  How we only see and understand a small part of whats actually going on in the world.  I think the world and science are amazing things, we should pursue knowledge and understanding.  I think we (theists) shouldn't force science to fit into out religious viewpoints (such as a 6000 year old earth), but at the same time there are questions which science can't answer, we're limited by our own evolved mind and religion may or may not answer those questions, but I think its sad that a book like this is far more concerned with proselytizing (biased at that) than actually considering the question of God.
1,I have just received the book and it is the worst piece of writing I have ever seen, maybe the worst piece available ranking right up their with Richard Brautigan's works but at least Richard did not pose it to be anything of value.		I hope he sells this with his disclosure statement that it is a piece of _ _ _ _ so that people don't feel they have the right the smack him.		Anyway, if you would like to throw away your money give it to a charity - don't even worry if they are doing anything useful, at least you won't waste your time.
1,Choppy & disjointed. Ending did not offer any conclusion. Only finished reading because I'd hoped it would get better. It did not. The only upside was the book was free.
1,Disappointing book. Print quality is poor. Not much information in the old ads.
1,there was nothing about the charecters or plot I found remotely entertaining. Don't waste your time and hopefully the hourglass will run out. Glass half empty on this one.
1,This was not what I was looking for. Always use a King James Bible. Had to erase from my tablet. Not user friendly!
1,Temple Stream really dragged.  Interminable descriptions of flowers and birds and beavers and trees.  There is no connection - I picture Roorbach walking around the woods muttering to himself, "Pretty, pretty, pretty,"  but not quite being able to put it all together.		This book is trying to be an updated version of A Sand County Almanac or Never Cry Wolf, but is not as good as either. I found Temple Stream boring, and never really understood the point.
1,i was so disappointed by some of her last books i decided not buy anymore, but i then decided to give her another chance. i loved her first books, the royals, the mermaid and especially betsy the vampire queen. while i think i understand why she changed the tune of the vampire series she did it to fast and really turned a lot of people off.  i am afraid i will not be buying anymore of her books. i am sure if she tired of writing her series or she is feeling pressure to publish either way this is one disappointed reader. sorry ms davidson, i really hope you listen to your fans. good luck
1,Did not like this book.  A waste of money
1,This is a very OLD-school book. It is mostly talk about his live, author`s 40 trading experience in 70-x. There were a lot of changes since then, and this book has just a historical value.
1,Big fan of Sandi Lynn and have loved every book I read. Not this one I could only get through maybe 3/4 chapters. It was like it wasn't even written by Sandi. It was fake, no background, to cheesy love. It was so bad I requested a refund.
1,Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation by Michael Pollan, The Penguin Press, 2013, 468 pages.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cooked-Natural-Transformation-Michael-Pollan/dp/1594204217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cooked Natural Transformation Michael Pollan</a>	This was a birthday gift from my daughter. It was a pure delight to read. Pollan does his research, writes elegantly and teaches me things I didn't know and hadn't thought about.
1,Very slow read.  I did finish it but didn't enjoy it.
1,The first book was good but this book was too long except for the end that ended abruptly.  The ending also made no sense what so ever unless there was to be another book, which I don't see.  Don't waste the time.
1,Jim Starlin is back with a new Marvel Original Graphic Novel (OGN) about his most enduring creation, Thanos.		The Mad Titan senses a disturbance in the force, or something, so decides to pay visits to just about everyone from the Guardians of the Galaxy to Mistress Death herself. After gazing into the Infinity Well, hes drawn to some kind of cosmic dreidel which is mega important apparently. Adam Warlock also joins Thanos for this sleepy tale of something and, as this is a Thanos book, its gotta have Infinity in the title! Why not Revelation, they haven't used that one yet!		Straight after the Avengers movie, I read Starlins The Infinity Gauntlet and really enjoyed it. Its the story of Thanos trying to impress his girlfriend, Death, by destroying the universe with the Infinity Gauntlet - the ultimate strength test at the fair ever! Things get daffy, lots of superhero action, etc. and it ends.		I wasn't expecting anything as good as that (especially as the other Marvel OGNs Ive read have been very sub-par) but I was hoping for something more than this. Thanos and Adam putter around, Thanos adventures in other books are covered, Thanos fights the Annihilators - Gladiator, Ronan the Accuser, Beta Ray Bill, Quasar and the Silver Surfer - and defeats them embarrassingly easily. Something happens with the dreidel that takes Thanos and Adam somewhere and then its over.		The Infinity Revelation is such an underwhelming, truly boring story that I cant believe anybody stopped to question whether or not the script deserved a rewrite. Even Thanos himself shrugs at the end Much ado about very little while Infinity sums it up with For all its buildup, this cosmic spectacular has proven disappointingly mundane. Took the words right out of my mouth!		Starlins art is the most polished that Ive ever seen and its nice to see the classic Marvel 70s/80s style done with todays inks/colours presentation. The book looks great, and its fun to see Thanos again - hes a lot more talkative and thoughtful in Starlins hands than weve seen with other creators like Jason Aaron or Jonathan Hickman, and I liked that.		But wow, what a weak, forgettable Thanos book! The Infinity Revelation feels more like an overlong prologue to something bigger than its own self-contained story or the quasi-conclusion of the numerous Thanos books over the years. I was hoping this one would be of the same quality as The Infinity Gauntlet but its more akin to Starlins dismal Batman books, Death in the Family and The Cult. Maybe Thanos fans will enjoy this, but for more general comics readers, this ones an easy miss.
1,Now here is a novel which I was really looking forward to reading. I've never read Nabokov before, but I had learned that this tale is about a nameless totalitarian state and the corruption of an intellectual within it (a plot not dissimilar to Thomas Keneally's "The Tyrant's Novel"). Thus it combines a fascinating theme with the reputation of a great writer.		What's the earliest you have ever given up on a book? My record is page 40. That would be page 40 of "Bend Sinister". And if you are wondering why, consider the following prose samples:		"The lights of the thither side were nearing in a shudder of concentric prickly iridescent circles, dwindling again to a blurred glow when you blinked, and extravagantly expanding immediately afterwards. He was a big heavy man. He felt an immediate connection to the black lacquered water lapping and heaving under the stone arches of the bridge."	[p. 16]		This kind of thing happens a lot in "Bend Sinister". Sweeping, languid over-description followed by an abrupt change of subject (or register) and then a grandly mysterious statement that might - or might not - mean something.		The following is not dialogue, just Nabokov:		"In the course of our, let me see, twelve, twelve and three months, years of life together, I ought to have immobilized by this simple method millions of moments; paying perhaps terrific fines, but stopping the train. Say, why did you do it? the popeyed conductor might ask. Because I liked the view."	[p. 17]		That such concentrated awfulness can be found within two consecutive pages of this novel is quite alarming. But the errors are not merely of style. Try the following:		"He thought of going out to mail his letter as bachelors are won't to do around eleven o'clock at night."	[p. 34]		Does this sentence mean that:	1. At around eleven o'clock he thought of going out?	2. He thought at some earlier time of going out at eleven o'clock?	3. Bachelors are won't to go out around eleven o'clock?		It's remarkable to find such syntactical confusion and garbled sense compacted into a single line of prose.		Yet even when the prose abominations are confined to just a phrase, examples are plentiful. Who - apart from a schoolboy clumsily trying to impress his English teacher - would refer to the moon as "our siliceous satellite"? [p. 19] Who would feel the necessity to invent a metaphor for the red rear reflector of a bicycle - and then call it an "anal ruby"? [p. 19] Who would paint the tenderness of lovers with the expression "her concavity fitting my convexity exactly"? [p. 30]		This is Nabokov's first novel in the English language, but he frequently throws in long sentences of untranslated French, presumably for fear that he was expressing himself too clearly. When Arthur Koestler (who wrote quite a bit about totalitarian regimes) looked back upon his first book in the English language, he had the following to say in the preface to a revised edition:		"Some pages now appear insufferably maudlin: others are studded with cliches, which, at the time, however, seemed original discoveries to the innocent explorer of a new language-continent ... I have confined myself to correcting only the most glaring gallicisms, germanisms and grammatical errors - and to throwing out adjectives and similes at a set rate of one in five."	["Scum of the Earth", p. 7/8]		The spirit which informs this passage - caution with a new language; economy of description; intellectual modesty - is the exact opposite of the spirit of Nabokov's prose. "Bend Sinister" comes across as gloriously self-impressed. Yet in reality the book is an unreadable rubble-heap of rookie mistakes, forced flair and random thought. No amount of faux-literary excuse-making on the part of Nabokov's defenders can hide a plot that fails to start or a sequence of self-indulgent interpolations which impart no information to the reader.		So - what reader will search for an allegory, a moral or a theme in such a junkyard of prose? Not I. (And not beyond page 40.)
1,Alright read with some mistakes but I had a hard time finding this story believeable
1,Okay storyline. Not a big fan of children's books that don't really go any where. This has a lot of repetition and ended in soup.
1,written in a very old-fashioned and disjointed way-would NOT recommend.
1,I love Nora Roberts' novels, but this one was unrealistic from the beginning. I almost just stopped reading it after the first chapter or two because of the debt situation. Shelby takes on Richard's debt. This includes the house payments, credit cards, etc. IF, and I believe this is the case, the credit cards were all in Richard's name, Shelby would not be responsible for that debt. She was likely an authorized user, in which case, she shouldn't even be able to make the payments. She would not have to file for bankruptcy. That's just how credit cards work. Obviously, Richard's estate would be obligated to pay off debt, but not Shelby, especially given she had nothing to lose or gain in what was left of the estate. The only piece that was actually explained was that she signed for the house, at which fact, learned later, made me go "huh?!" I understand banks sometimes give out home loans to people who are, shall we say, less than able to carry on the weight of the loan. In this case, given the value of the home, Richard would've had to put up a large some of cash as a down payment. Can you get a mortgage with only 3% down? Yes. Can you get a multi-million dollar mansion with only 3% down? Unlikely. Especially without either of them having proven income. Shelby's signature on those papers wouldn't mean anything to a bank. She has no money to her name and no job or source of income. Logically, this plot is a failure.		This really disappointed me because I had just read how Nora Roberts really likes to do research while writing her books to get a firm grasp on character development, places, and so on. She failed to do her legal research on this one. Pretty sure I learned this info in Contracts 1L year. A quick google search should've shown Nora the same thing.		What mainly kept me going on this book was the characters and the fact that I RARELY (all caps, as in, once in a blue moon) leave a book unfinished. Although Shelby was quite annoying at times with her repetitions (I'm taking classes, I love decorating, I'm going to open a business, etc.), I couldn't enough of her, Griffin, Callie, and all of the supporting characters. Between this and the fact that there were library holds on the book after me was what kept me going. If so many people want to read it, it must be good, right? No.
1,Basic, common knowledge information on relationships. We were very disappointed in the substance of this CD
1,Did not really like this.  Read it as an assignment.  Too much repetitive and too much about ho great the authors were to think up the system.
1,Ok...that was a waste of money. Don't bother. This goes nowhere. Very disappointed in the plot. And the ending was just down right stupid. Use your money on a book that is at least entertaining. Skip this one.
1,This book is incredibly funny at times, but I just didn't get it.  If you put a gun to my head and told me to tell you what actually happens in this book--how it unfolds, I would just say my last prayers.  I don't know what happened because I could never tell who was talking to whom.  I heard that Burroughs wrote "Naked Lunch", then cut it up and pieced it back together haphazardly.  I'm wondering if JSF did the same.  I'm not one of those sissies who needs the familiar to be OK either.  I admire the unconventionality of the novel, but I just could not follow it.  I happened to catch a local radio broadcast of this author being interviewed and he said he wrote the book for people who were willing to work at following and understanding the story. Apparently I am not one of those, allthough I tried.
1,I can't comment on the content of the story. I was stopped in my tracks by the bad writing.
1,Mark Prendergast's THE AMBIENT CENTURY is an encyclopedia of the biggest names in "ambient music", a style that's never defined, but which might be a) music that the author digs, and b) music that the author doesn't like so much but which lends respectability to later figures.		Prendergast starts off all the way at the beginning of 1900s with innovative classical music figures such as Debussy, Mahler, and Ravel. There is little that these figures have in common with what came later, but Prendergast seems like he has to start early and so comes up with these guys. His inclusion of Schoenberg and the other Viennese composers is just crazy, since most of the minimalists (who have a better claim to be the inspiration of techno, house, and drum & bass in the 80s and 90s) were trying as hard as possible *not* to write like that. Ditto for the inclusion of Pierre Boulez, although his friend Stockhausen merits inclusion.		Passing over the rock era (I'm not competent to comment much on this genre), I must take issue with his treatment of electronic music, which is somewhat US-centric. Sasha is presented as a minor figure that didn't achieve much until 1999, when his Ibiza compilation came out, when he had really be earning praise since 1990 (when the British press was calling him "The Man Like God"). The book then says that Sasha left the U.K. entirely for Australia, which is simply false. Frequent collaborator John Digweed is called "The James Brown of DJing", leading me to suspect that the author has never seen Digweed live.		This is a really disappointing and often-wrong book, and a bit of an odd duck because, expect for the "coolness" of it all, the people mentioned here have little in common. If you are interested in innovative classical music in the 20th century, try Griffith's MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER: Directions Since 1940 (Oxford University Press, 1995). Similarly, those interested in electronic music would do well to find a more focused guide.
1,I liked the book well enough when I started it. But by the halfway point, you realize the characters are never going to mature and the narrative starts to plod along painfully. The male characters, especially, are unbearable. I don't see any growth in them throughout the book - it's as if they are perpetually 17 years old. I wouldn't normally mind but after several hundred pages it gets a bit old and you want to smack them. Immature and pretentious does not equal "artist" or "brilliant." I would classify this as "On the Road" except twice as long and not half as interesting. At least Kerouac's writing style keeps you going. I didn't even want to finish this book.
1,"Looking at Movies" is a sloppy hodgepodge of a textbook about most aspects of film and movies.	On 600 pages, the authors provide a textbook of how to analyze movies. There are 11 chapters on such important topics as Looking at Movies (1), Principles of Film (2), Types of Movies (3), Elements of Narrative (4), Acting (7), Editing (8), Film History (10) and the production process (11);	The book is not supposed to be a manual on how to shoot movies do-it-yourself style, but rather to provide tools for academic and theoretical analysis.	The material they provide is rich with examples, photos and references, thus very accessible also for readers, who might not have seen all the movies discussed in the book.	The two authors, Richard Barsam and Dave Monahan are both professors for film studies.	Theses are the pluses of the book.	However, my biggest objection to the book "Looking at Movies" is that it does not manage to make its point clear.	All kind of different things are thrown together into one bag. Sound, light, acting, dramaturgy, visual aesthetics as if they were of the same significance. A new film students head must be spinning! What is film, what not? What counts, what not?	There are no clear categories. But they would be required for proper analysis.	There is a hierarchical relation between intrinsic film properties like image, movement, stop-projection, editing and non-intrinsic add-ons such as sound, narrative, acting, staging of scenes and sequences. This is very similar to analyzing a tapestry and not making a distinction between the fabric and the picture on it.	But the authors don't seem to notice.	Another flaw is the unreflected focus on Hollywood movies.	Sure, Hollywood is the most effective and venerated dream machine.	But even in discussing image composition or dramatic structure there should be at least some awareness that Hollywood aesthetics is not a natural basic property of all moving images. Perhaps the book would have benefited from rearranging the chapters, too, going from the more general to the specific and not, like it is now, from Hollywood movies front and center to other countries and time periods as what appears a mere afterthought at the end of the book (chapter 11).	Despite numerous voices of critique, which can`t be entirely dismissed, I still prefer James Monaco`s old old tome "How to read a film";	and for clarity and conciseness the unsurpassed 1932 classic "Film as Art" by the German art-theorist and psychologist Rudolf Arnheim.
1,What a disappointment!  I wish I hadnt wasted a perfectly good afternoon on this book.  The story was a continuation of Savannah Blues and the other adventures of Weezie and Bebe and it does not do well as a stand alone.  In fact, I had read and enjoyed Savannah Blues - I hadn't read the other Weezie and Bebe Mysteries --  even so I found this one long and rather boring.  Unless you read it as a pleasant continuation of the first book, it is just a lot of pages with no plot and nothing happening.  Lots of details of NYC at Christmas time and endless details about antiques/vintage stuff and estate sale purchases but these things (and their many pages worth of detailed descriptions) have no direct bearing on the story and just feel like filler.  With little (if any) storyline, no emotional development and no particular humor, nothing about this book justifies the price.  In fact, I think this reads more like an epilogue for the Weezie and Bebe series.  Unless you are a devoted fan of this duo and the previous stories, I recommend passing on this one.
1,I bought this to read and then give my 70 year old father who loves western movies on television and is starting to branch out in his literary tastes. I could not get past the first 100 pages without becoming bored and a little grossed out. My son also tried it, he is a lover of fantasy novels and science fiction, and anything really, and is a writer himself. He decided it must just be that I am a female reader that maybe it was just geared more towards a male audience, although he is actually quite the feminist. He couldn't get through it either, even when faced with reading it during a long doctor's office wait or utter boredom. He finally chose boredom. But, maybe, just maybe, my dad will like it after all. You never know.
1,I took about two weeks before completing this book, this is the worst book I've ever read. I've never enjoyed a book by this author, this is this last I'll read from her n this is the worst I've ever read. Enough said!
1,We'll never know, but I believe that if Mitch Albom had not just written the appealing "Tuesdays with Morrie", this book either would not have been deemed worthy of publishing or would have sunk like a stone.	Why do I say that?  Let me count the ways:	1) It's BORING.  The main character does not engage my interest.  Even his love story and his war experiences are unexciting.	2) The writing is BAD.  Physical descriptions seem arbitrary and superimposed on the story.  The language is clunky.  The sentences don't flow.  I have nothing against sports writers--I read the sports pages first every day--but this fish is way out of water.	3) The message of the book is the OPPOSITE OF INSPIRING.  It encourages people not to change, not to stretch or grow.  It seeks to reassure people that even if they live out their status quo, it's all right.  They can reconcile in the afterlife their self-defeating choices, their despair, their sense of defeat, their surrender of life.  The intellectul thrust of the book, like some anti-Nike, is: JUST DON'T DO IT!  That is, don't worry, it's okay, it'll all work out.  There's no need to struggle or work on yourself or change.  It's okay to stay miserable.  All I can say to that is: UGH!	The success of this book tells me that a lot of people appreciate the consolation it offers for self-defeating life choices.  I may be out of step with that current.  So be it.  Unlike Albom, my hope for humankind is that we all do not go softly into the night.
1,I can't even begin to tell you how horrible this book is. I read a lot of it so I thought and assumed I was more than half way done and I was only at 20%. I have tried numerous times to finish it and it only got worse. The wife in the story is so bloody annoying I finally gave up!
1,This book is hailed as a classic; I found it sad and tedious. A thinly changed bio by a Hollywood boy, the product of a faded once popular cowboy star and an angry, self- diluded mother. The tone is snarky, the laughs few, the message depressing.
1,Jenna OConnor is a hybrid, half werewolf and half demon, something unique in this world, and if she is ever found out, she will be killed instantly. At least, that is what her demon mother and her werewolf uncle have told her her whole life. And so Jenna was raised in secret, not going to school like other children, never having a friend. But she is determined to be a cop, like her other uncle, and she does manage to go through police academy and become a cop in her own tiny village. But now she has been appointed a member of the SWAT team, her dream come true. No one knows she is not human, but one of her team members is not human either, and he does notice something different about her. As does the sort of bounty hunter they encounter on their very first mission. He is intrigued when Jenna does not act submissive towards him, as she should have done. So when he finds out she is a werewolf, and a lone one at that, he is determined to have her brought in his pack where he can keep her safe and under lock and key.		Her new team member is a demon himself, and he is not going to hand Jenna over to Adam without her getting to know them both. He is attracted to her as well. Jenna has not only been raised protected and sheltered, she also knows next to nothing about werewolves, demons or the Others like vampires. So she is ignorant and doesnt know how to interact with them, what it means being a pack member.	Adam knows he has to tread slowly and carefully with Jenna, or else she will run fast and far and his wolf has determined she is his mate and wants her.		I don't know about this book, it could have been my mood while reading this book. But I was told repeatedly, if you like Shelley Laurenston (which I do!) you will like this one too. And I completely disagree. They are nothing alike other than they both write about shifters.		At first I thought I would like Jenna, she was a capable female, a member of the SWAT team, and that is not an easy job to get. But she is ignorant, and falls for the very first werewolf she meets. She doesnt mind that her brand new co-worker Kent comes on to her very heavy handed and rubs himself against her and stuff, and that while she is a virgin as well. She enjoys it, until she finds out he is manipulating the pool balls to win their bet, and she knows instantly he is a demon because of that, and tries to run from the bar.	Right in Adams arms, the werewolf bounty hunter, who has tracked her down thanks to her demon collegue.		So, after running away from then, she later agrees to meet with them and talk, and have them explain things, when all she wants is to be left alone. But Jenna is determined to learn more about her heritage and her father, and ignores her families warnings that hybrids are killed on sight. Which is not true anymore, as her uncle could have told her many years ago.		Adam invites her to meet his sister and another pack member, his beta, and to out to a Shifter club with him that night, and Jenna accepts. Well, it is more an excuse for an orgy, and everyone is grabbing at her, and everyone else, and she is totally okay with that. And of course they heavy attraction she has to Adam, who almost has sex with her in the hallway of the club. Where she is saved by the telephone as her boss calls her in for an emergency hostage situation.		Of course Jenna and Kent save the day when they find out that the bad guys are Shifters, the human SWAT members won't stand a chance against their strength and speed. And so they have a mystery to solve.	Adam takes Jenna to his Pack, where she meets the Pack Master, who is, surprise, her missing uncle Owen. He is sort of the Alpha of all the American Alphas and he really likes Adam. And o, another surprise, there is Logan as well, who is Jennas half brother and a full werewolf. Jenna accepts it all without many questions and is at once protective of her little brother.		To find out more about the rogue Shifters, Kent takes her with him to visit Gage who is a dangerous tiger shifter. As Kent drives like a lunatic, Jenna shifts into her wolf when they are at their destination to teach him a little lesson, but then of course has no clothes anymore. Gage provides her with some of his sisters clothes, and when she accuses him of dressing her like a hooker, he is if course mightily offended on his sisters behalf.		Okay, lots more things happen, there is apparently a powerful wolf pack in Germany with a famous Alpha, who is now in trouble. So a trip to Germany is in order, for Jenna, Kent, uncle Owen, brother Logan and suitor Adam, and Gage and his brother Alec who is a black ring fighter. Adam needs to mate with Jenna, but Jenna needs more time. She gets pressured into accepting Adam as her mate, or else he will loose control to his wolf and will have to be put down. Jenna is 24, Adam is 60, Shifters live for thousands of years and mate for life, and usually find their mate when they are a few hundred years old. And expecting all this from Jenna, who knows next to nothing about being in a Pack and what it entails, is completely unfair.		All of the Others are completely over sexed, it is like it is all they want to do all day long. Waiting staff in clubs are almost naked, and sex is on the menu in public or in private. Nope, not my kind of shifter world at all.		I really wanted to like this book and its characters, and I did for a bit, but there were just too many things I really did not like or enjoy. I wanted Jenna to be a good kick ass heroine, like Shelly Laurenston writes them, and she has a few of those moments, but she just doesnt cut it. In comparison she is a weakling and she also cant stand up to Adam when he touches her or kisses her or whatever. Yes, he tries his best, but he is also pushing her way too fast. And her Uncle is completely fine with that as Adam is a great Alpha and a good man.		5 stars (out of 10)		<p>	&copy; 2014 Reviews by Aurian </p>
1,If you are a pre-menopausal spinster who believes that Jon Stewart has "universal appeal," you will love this book. If you are not a spinster. pre-menopausal, nor believe Jon Stewart's appeal to be indeed universal, you may want to give this book a pass.		I loved Frasier, so thought this book would have some of the same wit, charm, and pacing. No such luck. Flett-Giordano jams gags into almost every sentence, only one of which I found funny, hence the single star. One for each funny joke. Yes, there is only one. Bad news, it's on page 25, so you have to slog through 277 additional pages without comic relief. Only a deep misogynist could have developed such unlikeable female characters, many of whom are defined by the sexual proclivities.  We have dumb sluts, self-loathing ditzes, and vicious "cuntessas" (an example of what the author considers a joke). The men, by contrast, show pretty well, even though many treat the females in the book quite badly: a rugged Air Force officer, a charming womanizing detective, a handsome real estate developer, and a smoldering eco-terrorist. Finally, the pacing is frenetic. Flett-Giordano is obviously a talented and well-paid writer, but she is so desperate to be quick and cute, there is little character development or suspense.		Here's a test. Read the quote below.		Like it? Hit one-click now.		Don't like it but want something funny written by a Frasier alum? buy "My Blue Heaven" by Joe Keenan.		And my guess is that if you aren't a Jon Stewart loving woman of a certain age, you'll be reading Joe rather than Anne.		"In celebration, she was treating herself to the rare luxury of basking in the skin-aging sun while she sipped her Obama blend. It was a whimsical mix of Hawaiian and Indonesian beans from Vices and Spices. She'd been unable to resist the Commander in Chief's smiling face above the slogan: "Yes, you can have a good cup of coffee."
1,Silly story
1,It's a dangerous thing, having expectations in life. It is especially dangerous, at least for me, to have high expectations of books. That Night was a book that rocked a synopsis I wouldn't need to think twice about picking up. A questionable murder, someone wrongly accused, the truth slowly leaking out in nail biting chapter after nail biting chapter!? Yes, PLEASE. Where do I sign up? However, this book failed to rouse me. I was highly anticipating the conclusion, there's no doubt, but the writing was juvenile, and the story line was just endlessly, and unnervingly, depressing.		Toni is a rebel without a cause, at least initially. Told in alternating time periods-Toni's present day in prison/as a free woman, and her teenage years in high school-we slowly gain insight into a life that was relentless in it's downfalls. As a student, Toni was constantly teased and bullied by a horrid group of girls, at home, she and her mother were always at odds. Her younger sister, Nicole, is anything but an ally, especially when she decides to join forces with the wrong crowd at school, the same crowd that favours Toni as their target practice. Toni's one beacon of happiness, and hope, is her boyfriend Ryan. Things go from unbearable to tortuously horrible one night, when Nicole is found murdered during an outing with Toni and Ryan. With no other suspects in question, they are both sent to prison for 15 years, emerging older, but barely wiser. But they plan to be...they plan on finding out exactly who DID kill Nicole, and reclaim their lives.		There was definitely a disconnect that existed for me with this book, there were things that were justified, and then things that annoyed the living hell out of me. The latter being the fact that Toni was just, plainly put, a spoiled brat when it came to her attitude with her mother. I'm not sure if the author intended for a feeling of solidarity, but I just didn't understand what was SO horrible about a mother telling her child to clean up her room, or try harder in school, or not get into fights. I DEFINITELY understood Toni's hurt, and anger, with her mother later on in the book, when she refuses to believe in Toni's innocence-I actually never hated a character's mother SO MUCH in my life at that point. I also found it hard to accept the "intense bond" that Toni and Ryan shared (side note: my boyfriend's name is also Ryan, so, in theory, this SHOULD have been easier). It just felt juvenile, all the way through, even when we were supposed to believe that almost a lifetime apart didn't take away from their "love".		The definite shining point, and redeemer, in That Night, was the race to the truth. Despite being unrealistically fraught with bad luck moment, after bad luck moment, Chevy Stevens did a great job of building suspense; of causing me to question the innocence of more than one character. I wasn't exactly picking my jaw up off the floor when the "big reveal" happened, but it was a neat wrap-up, and I'll admit, I wasn't exactly expecting it to head that way.		Overall, That Night was a perfect transition for those who usually prefer Young Adult fiction, and are looking to branch out into the adult genre. I will be giving Chevy Stevens' other works a try, in hopes of enjoying those a lot more than I did this book.
1,I agree with the criticisms submitted.  The book is an analysis of Lee's generalship.  It suffers from the absence of Lee's personal account. As a result, a lot of conjecturing and second guessing occurs.  The first hand research documenting and supporting his arguments is not as rigorous.		Having said that I still think it is worthwhile reading.  It does offer an alternative view of Lee's leadership.  His theme is not a new one. Even Burke Davis had remarked on the apotheosis of Lee after the war. The book examines Lee's field decisions and style of command. By emphasizing the difference between strategic and tactical issues as well as examining patterns of Lee's tactical decisions, it increased my appreciation of some of the nuances in troop placement and topography.  For amateur history buffs of the civil war, it is a worthwhile read especally since my local library has a copy.  Would I buy it? probably not the hardcover edition.
1,A very boring book from a writer I have read so many better books from.
1,Why all the good reviews? This was assigned reading for a book club, not one of the 8 of us liked it at all. Amateurish writing, too many plot holes, people don't act, talk think like any of these characters, even is the reader suspends all disbelief.
1,This book is a collection of technical papers on the chemistry and industrial processes of cheesemaking.  It is not a how-to guide for making artisan cheeses at home.
1,It's fine if required, but not something I would CHOOSE to read. A little dry and honestly there are better titles of comparable aim.
1,That's right I said it. Let's be honest, Robert E. Lee did not approve of slavery, but he thought blacks were inferior to whites. Jefferson Davis owned slaves, but he trusted a black man to run his family business while he was away on business. "Stonewall" Jackson owned slaves, but he also educated blacks in his area by opening schools and churches for them. However, Jackson too also felt blacks were inferior to him. Basically, I am pointing out the fact that the "fathers" of the Confederacy was JUST like Abe Lincoln...a bunch of racists who had conflicting views about black people.		What Kennedy failed to realize is the South should blame themselves for their reputation. Its their behavior AFTER the Civil War that sealed their fate. These racists formed the KKK, which terrorized blacks, burn down their businesses and even burn down their churches. White women falsely accused black men of raping or looking at them, which led to black men being lynched. White men continued to rape black women as if they owned them. The South denied blacks equal access to education, health care, businesses, homes and jobs. The South denied blacks the right to vote and it goes on and on......		It will take ANOTHER 100 years AFTER 1860 for a new movement (The Civil Rights) for the South to get their act together and that movement took even more lives. The South needs to look at itself and stop blaming Abe Lincoln for their reputation....they are the ones who continued to be racist and evil after the War.		It is true...the North had its problems when it came to blacks, but at least the North left black people alone and allowed them to have some access to things. The South did not and even when blacks tried to build their lives by themselves, the South would harm them (example, Rosewood). That is why so many Southern blacks left the South after the War because in the North, they had a chance.		The South was WRONG and until they admit they hold some blame for their reputation, they will continue to be wrong.
1,All I can say is don't waste your time. I didn't like it from the beginning, I should have stopped then. This was poorly written. Too many good books out there with better character development and plot. Try Real!!! That's quite the story.
1,The woman in this book seriously lets the guy walk all over her.  He does something horrible, disappears, apologizes, repeat.  No woman in their right mind would act like her.
1,I've read similar books and loved them, but I just couldn't get into this book.
1,only got up to 134 and 8 were wrong. don't buy this
1,#thatfeeling. When an interesting dark read series turns into a trainwreck.		Congratulation! The sheer stupidity is overwhelming.		I get that Pepper, when confronted with criticism, says that this book is "all about emotion" (as opposed to actual research) but you would at least expect her to get her OWN facts straight!		1. In a previous book, Pepper wrote that it was Nila's mother and great-grandmother that were buried in the Weaver family cemetery. Now, it's all about how her grandmother and mother died.		2. "Bonnie was a born Hawk" (stated on her own Facebook page)... Nope, here she married into the family.		3. "The Weavers were beheaded by ax" ... No wait, guillotine! (invented well after the first debt inheritance, but who cares about facts?) I can just imagine Pepper thinking "Hey, both have at the very least got sharp blades, so nobody will notice, right!?" Riiiiiiight.		4. Why would the Hawks feel the need to smuggle their own diamonds into England when they've got the law, the prime ministers AND the crown in their pockets? Plus; you can import the gems legally even when you're not best buds with England's finest! Makes. No. Sense.		And Pepper: When "researched" torture techniques, did you never stumble upon a page which said that testimonies given under torture CANNOT be trusted because people will say ANYTHING to make the pain go away? Yet, your Disney villain character suddenly turns remorseful... For REALSIES?		Well, here is my reply to that particular scene:	~Much stupid in this one, swallow your mother should have~ (paraphrase from Yoda meme)		Speaking of villains: You had one final chance to explain their motivations, to make me understand them. When you decided to write their POV'S I thought you'd at least TRY to redeem yourself. I should have known better.		"Prophetic Emma"? Talk about tstl storyline. I'm almost tempted to award you a half star because you realised how dumb she sounded, and had Cut behead her as punishment for her stupidity.		To top of your terrible story, you offed the one good thing about the story.		FINAL THOUGHTS ON FINAL DEBT:		Congratulations, Pepper. You made it to the very top of my worst reads of 2015 list.
1,I don't get all the 5 stars here?  I found the book dragged on and on.  It jumped back and forth in time which was more of a distraction  then entertaining or informative.  I found the authors style to be slow and the characters flat.  I tried several times to get into this book, but ended up and picking other books up and finishing them so after three times doing that I figured this book was overrated.
1,This book had an interesting premise and it started out relatively well, but about midway through I thought it took a turn for the worst. I finished it because it was a relatively quick read but if I had known how the story would play out I would have skipped it. It just wasn't for me.
1,A worthless rant
1,Nice writing, but way too depressing to finish.  As a lifelong NYC-er born in the Bronx, I really wanted to like this book but stopped reading it halfway through.  Couldn't take all the suffering.		The New York Times Book Review compared this novel to BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES by Tom Wolfe.  I don't think so . . . .
1,WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am so disgusted by the ending of this book.  After working towards a relationship for four books, to change course seems inconceivable.  I don't care how good the author writes, I read to be entertained and I was not entertained at all by this book.  I felt Merritt acted out of character and the ending has to be a plot device. I am so angry that I spent money on this when the author feels she can destroy characters and relationships on a whim.  At least if his death had meant something I would be ok.  But not like this.  Very poor.
1,Less realistic and sillier than the wolves of Willoughby Chase. Dido is the only interesting character and the mix of Welsh, Roman and Spanish myths and words is more annoying than creative.
1,This book appears to be written for counselors to read.  I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before buying it.
1,I paid for it. But  it never arrived on my kindle, so I cant comment on the book
1,I feel so badly about this because I never give harsh reviews, but I just can't think of anything great to say. I am exhausted! Couldn't wait to get to the end and be done with the monotony. Every chapter is a cliff hanger, when "suddenly" something intervenes and saves the day. Every chapter. Over and over. Felt no real connection to most of the characters and definitely no love connection between the 3 primary couples. Yes, Kyra was a good hero, but sometimes annoying in her decision making abilities. I think if it were limited to 2 books it could have been much better.
1,When I read this author is a playwright, it all made sense. This story is written as if it's a play: she woke up, she did this, he said that. It's reminiscent of a newspaper story or Wikipedia entry, which is the exact opposite tone one should strive for in a time travel-fantasy novel.	We have to know how characters are feeling, who they are, so we can care about what happens to them.		If you have a kindle, download a sample before deciding to buy. If you like the author's style, great. I couldn't get through it being unable to connect with any of the characters or their plight.		Two stars for the plot idea and the book cover.
1,This isn't a fully bound book, It is simply folded in half and stapled in the center. This isn't that big of a deal for me so far as it's held up well to my destructive 4 year old, but others may find it disappointing.		My daughter really enjoys looking through this book and asks me to read/say the prayers with her all the time, more out of interest than some devout inner devotion. So it has helped spark her interest in learning the prayers.		What was most disappointing for me was the wording of the prayers. The words are not the traditional wording of the prayers that my daughter is used to saying. Some of the wordings of the prayers aren't even the normal modern wording of prayers, they just seem to be rephrased according to the publisher's desire. I wanted to use this book to help my daughter learn some of the more well-known prayers of the faith, but the wording isn't what she would be learning or using at school or church or anywhere that I know.
1,Corny and BAD writhing, another great storyline ruined by a very bad author who needs a lot more learning in writhing books.
1,The description of the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust and survivors trying to come to grips with the devastation...is very realistic.		But, as if the survivors don't have enough to worry about, they're being chased by redneck zombies with rotten teeth and metallic zombies who shapeshift into flesh eating gas.  Don't know what the metal beings are after or where they came from...story got too far out there for me and I gave up.
1,I eagerly picked this book up when I saw it in a store because I am a huge fan of Satrapi's two memoirs of her childhood in Iran and adolescence in Europe ("Persepolis" volumes one and two), but this was a big disappointment. There are hints of the humor, candor, and stark realism that made those two works brilliant, but at a mere 83 pages "Chicken With Plums" doesn't do much more than hint at its larger themes. The story feels half-finished and you are left hopelessly wondering why there isn't any more to it. It certainly has an intriguing premise (that being the last eight days of Satrapi's uncle's life, after his beloved Tar is broken and he decides to die when it cannot be replaced), but ultimately goes nowhere. "Chicken With Plums" is frustrating because there seems to be so much room to expand it into a truly affecting story -- and Satrapi is certainly capable of doing such a tale justice. So why doesn't she? Why does she instead publish something that feels infuriatingly under-developed? I would recommend that anyone interested in Satrapi's work turn to the incredible "Persepolis" books instead of reading this, and anyone who is a fan of those volumes should skip this as well lest their memories of those great works become tarnished.
1,Nothing really new in this book. It was hyped pretty big. Disappointed in it. More about himself than Hillary. He isn't telling all or even the truth (if he knows it) about Vince Foster and others. Don't spend the money because if you are interested you already know all this information.
1,No one cares if the wall paper looks 8 years old and is red with little brocaid circles that meander about. At least 50 percent of the words were filler that neither enhanced the story nor contributed in any way at all.
1,I barely finished this book. It was plodding. Like this review. I really liked Niven's collaboration with Jerry Pournelle on Lucifer's Hammer. I read that twice. I had high hopes for Ringworld. Nope!
1,The basic plot was ridiculous. And the book didn't even finish. Just stopped.
1,I just wanted to read this to see how bad this would be. The main coyote, Brand X, seemed to be a Gary Stu just from the back. Surviving a fanmily massacre? That's unlucky to the point of being unbelievable.		I found Albert and Hallie quite exasperating when the novel started because, they were so stupid! It didn't help that they didn't seem to notice. Hallie's nomenclature for the animals was quite uncreative. All she did was name them after brands. That made me wonder if the author wanted to see how many brand names she could fit into the story.		Speaking of Hallie, she threw rocks at the hunter, who shot Valvoline. Never mind that he at least apologized! He could've said ,"I shot your pet? That's too bad." In addition, she did that when he was driving away. She could've popped his tire or dented his car. On the plus side, she wrote a letter to the editor to criticize them and stand up for the coyotes.		I was a little more bothered by how Frank Kincaid was the stereotypical hunter than he killed Brand X's family. (Don't get me wrong. I still considered that much more gruesome than necessary. The man had no qualms about targeting pups.) It was due to the fact that hunters don't often get a positive depiction since, attacking an animal always makes look you bad-no exceptions. (A case in point is when a vet kicked a dog in order to save a family cat. She was fired despite having a legitimate reason).		Hank deserved a mention as a detestable human, despite appearing for a few pages. Not for the fact that he ran over Boyardee, it was the fact that he blamed the animal. That riled me up because, I've always gotten angry at how my father would sometimes talk about how animals cross the road then blame road kill accidents on them! I thought that he didn't care to learn about how animals think at first. I then realized that he just didn't want to blame the person. (Keep in mind that he's quite old enough to know better. Also, there are a lot of things people either try to avoid blame for or deflect blame on something else).		I couldn't fault the coyote exterminators too much since they were just doing their jobs and I something say ,"Someone's got to do the unpleasant jobs." (Of course, I wouldn't apply to that reason to every one of them). However, I was maddened at how they went to kill the whole group just because, they couldn't be assured that they wouldn't harm this child named Jenny. Never mind that there was a high chance of them leaving her alone.		Speaking of Jenny, I didn't understand how anybody was supposed to ignore how improbable her journey would've been. It was implied that she had no water for a trek that would've taken several hours.		Ray Draper was just the stereotypical trapper who wouldn't obey the law because, he didn't want his 'style' cramped. Never mind that some people just wanted to make trapping more inhumane, instead of banning it. Speaking of him, I thought his lie about having a purebred mutt in the back of his truck was stupid at first. That was until I remembered that some people do register mutts as purebreds.		Even though I called Brand X a Gary Stu right off the bat, I wanted to add more reasons for the labeling. He was three weeks-old yet knew what to do to survive. (If he was a few weeks older and made a few mistakes that carried consequences, I might've bought his survival because, I found out about a story about an orphaned pack of six week-old pups survived).		That said, there were a couple of incidents I couldn't label him a Gary Stu for because, animals would do this. The first incident was at the watering hole. He invaded someone else's territory yet ended up earning respect from everyone else. In addition, the original owner ended up getting scorned. The second incident was how Salem and Chieko competed for his attention, despite there being other males. Brnad X was the strongest, which a female would want.		Speaking of them, I didn't mind Brand X choosing Chieko because, she was distinguished from the other coyotes. First off, her name is Japanese. Also, she revered prey (even though that seemed kind of implausible). The most important thing was she was the one who reached Skywater.		I was left with a couple of questions. First off, why would Brand X's mother mutilate herself to grieve for her mate? The last time I checked, coyotes stuck to howling and whining. Also, why would the author be fine with writing (or typing) putting defecate yet use a substitute word for urinate?		The author's writing style was quite subpar. The author could've introduced the characters first then revealed their tragic past much later. Instead they introduced the characters then revealed that soon afterwards. That left me thinking ,"Am I supposed to feel sad?" (That's coming from somebody who feels bad for anybody, whether or not I like them).		Likewise, the tragedy didn't seem well-written. Most of the group died unnecessary deaths. (I hear about those all the time in real life. Why would I want to pick up a book to experience that)? Hallie's death was an exception, though. She was quite old and the back kind of implied that. I still found no real reason to develop an attachment to any of the characters. I also thought that she knew her story would get boring.(For the record, I'd say that about anyone who kills off a lot of characters. The one exception would be David Clement-Davies for his novel The Sight).		I praised the novel for being profane at first due to the types of words used and knowing people don't like seeing them in a young adult novel. That was until I saw loved used as a substitution word.		I felt that the author gave a poor explanation for why the coyotes couldn't drink the Skywater. It couldn't be drank because, it belonged to the spirits? What? Wasn't the fact that Dinky Moore became thirstier not good enough? (I recommend taking this bit with a grain of salt because, I'm not a spiritual person).		All that said, I was glad that the chapters were short and it took just a few days to be read. On another note, I wanted to point out that this was published in the 90s. (I have no clue why Amazon would set the publishing date at June 14, 2016).
1,The plot was all over the place. I cannot even believe this book was published.  This was a waste of time to read.
1,Not too bad in the beginning.... I was cruising along thinking it was just an easy read. I like my books to have a bit if interest, but I thought although I was quite plain I felt I could keep going. I got half way and stopped. Contradictory behaviour and actions from characters does not help.		No thanks.
1,I like Arenson's writing style, it's engaging, descriptive and he does a good job of painting a vivid mental picture of the scene. I guess what got me were two things.		1. Pacing - The entire near destruction of the Requiem civilization and the quest to find artifacts lost for thousands of years takes about two, maybe three days of character time. The princess conveniently pulls out a book form a library of thousands of books and nearly instantaneously turns to the page that will save her civilization.... and it's off to save the world.		2. Mundaneness  (Yeah, I know it's not a word) - To me, dragons in a story are an elemental force - rare, beautiful and deadly. In this book, the whole civilization can turn into a dragon and it seems that everything can kill them (even giant, flying leaches!). The myth of the dragon has been regulated to the merely human and mundane. Maybe if only one or two people a generation could do this, it would have made for a more exciting and intriguing plot line.
1,I'm not sure if the problem is with me or the book.. Perhaps this just wasn't my kind of read.		Either way, I finished it, because I was waiting for it to become less sadistic, and more..."normal"? I was waiting for Gage to become more of a human being, instead of just beating the absolute %$&# out of Kayla.		I didn't understand the psychology of having an abusive past with a male, and then keep going back to a person just as awful. She cried almost every time after the beatings, yet kept going back. Perhaps it's me, but I just cannot relate to that. I was waiting for either Gage to change, or Kayla to open her eyes.		Her daughter is supposed to be struggling with leukemia, and she's the reason why Kayla agrees to this, yet halfway through the book you - and Kayla too - just forget about the dying little girl. No mother does that...		Overall, this book made me angry, and feel like crap. If you have a taste for hardcore BDSM, and feeling like absolute poop at the end of it, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, I cannot recommend it.
1,Just another Trump basher
1,Mr. Balakian unfortunately as other many Armenian authors, wrote a fairy tale instead of a history book. The chapter related to Adana, 1909 was particularly to my interest as it is my home town. There is a saying in Adana:  When someone gets mad and feels there is unjustice, he says "Even Agop is better than you".	I asked once to my uncle, who is born in 1909, as a kid what this saying means. He said, after the Armenian insurrection in 1909, Talat Pasa and an Armenian representative "Agop Efendi" (Hagop Babikian)came to Adana. Talat Pasa, supposedly to provide justice sentenced about 30 Moslems and some Armenians to death. Agop Efendi asked Talat Pasha to stop the death penalties and said : "It was Armenians who started this after all. And many people have already been died. Let us give an end to death penalties".	Agop Efendi's comment was very welcomed particularly by the Turkish public. And to refer this, there was this saying since then....	Mr. Balakian! Are you sure your sources are reliable? Where did you get the idea Hagop Babikian was mysteriously killed by the Turks (that's what you are implying)? Is there any chance the Turks in Adana who felt they owe thier life to Agop Efendi would have killed him? Are you sure if he indeed were killed mysteriously later on was not killed by Armenians who were mad at him because he said it was the Armenians who started it? It was definetely not Talat Pasa either as Talat did his best to convince his Armenian citizens that he is objective and on their side as well...	It was also to my attention you refered to English archives and put the number 2000 Armenians killed in Adana, but forgot to include 600 Moslems (who were killed) which was in the very same archive..Apparent, you selectively picked the section of the archive you liked and eliminated the part you didn't. Don't you count the ones who died if they are Moslems? What kind of human being are you? Are you an Armenian?	I found your approach quite unethical and therefore would not even give one star to your book, but I have to put something.... It's unfortunate, but reality, this book is garbage..But again unfortunately, because the Americans do not know and cheer up with their Armenian fellows, probably many will like your book without even knowing its true value (= 0). This book is another "Midnight Express"...	Please ask me about this book:	meltemd3@yahoo.com
1,I was so disappointed in this book. It was one long chase scene where the main character described in detail the buildings and cities he was passing through. It was like running after a tour guide who was running from the police just  to listen to them describe the wonders of Italian cathedrals and Istanbul's history! When the chase ended (around 3/4 of the way through the book) we were treated to an absurd plot ending and plot twists that were just plain dumb. *spoiler*The dumbest was that the scientist that was going to unleash a plague/virus/whatever on the world left a trail of breadcrumbs only a student of Dante's inferno could figure out. Why would he do that? I normally read a book in a day or two but it took me two weeks to plod through this one.
1,This is the second of the three Kurt Muller novels, and I almost abandoned it half way through. The characters and plotting are wearisome and not interesting or engaging.  While not exactly a polemic, the author's bias is loud and clear: greens, ultra-libs, and their ilk are the good guys, and business, the FBI, and the military are the bad guys. If your predilections align with the author's you may find these books more interesting than I did, but for me, the heavy handed political posturing overwhelmed any intrinsic value in the mystery and its solution.  You may wish to borrow one of these books before investing in them, they do build on each other, but it is not necessary to read them in order.
1,Ordered one which did not work. Then got a replacement that did not work.  The text of the book was sweet but the "video" part did not work on either copy. Just returned them both.
1,I was so incredibly in love with this series, in fact I love this author. I have bought every single one of her books. But I feel so angry and betrayed at how she ended this incredible couples story that I am not sure if I can even buy another one of her books. That is how invested I was in Della and Ren and their love.  Holy crap, I cant BELIEVE  it. I am heartbroken that she chose to do this. I hated the ending. HATED IT. Ugh. Beyond devastated. How could you...
1,Let me caution any reader considering this book. After investing several hours reading, I wanted to shake the author once I read the ending. The author may know something about Ireland; however, I don't think she knows ANYTHING about British history and aristocracy. "SPOILER"--I understand that this is a historical romance, but a LORD living in poverty as a lumberjack in pioneer America, while his sister lives in luxury on HIS estate in England is laughable.  Oh...and he is supposed to have died and the sister is in on the scam, but she still lets he and his family live without a cent of his money!  PLEASE.....		I liked the main characters and the Arrangement premise is very clever.  However, the author detracted from her story by skipping around to various locations and dates. A chronological telling of this story or maybe 1 or 2 flashbacks would have served her H and h better.  I'd love to see these characters again in a story that makes historical sense and is appropriate for the time and position of the Hero.
1,Yes, the stories are beautifully written. Excellent prose. But addresses the losses, regrets and futility of life. I would have liked to read a story that had some hope in it. This was one of my book club's selections. The leader of the discussion said this is one of the great books you MUST have on your book self. Maybe so. But I only read a few of the stories, then gave the book away.
1,When I reached Chapter 37 and read the words of one of the female protagonist's, "I'm such a fool," I suddenly realized that I was saying the same thing to myself.  After reading one of the most unbelievable and poorly executed sex scenes before I turned off the light last night (side comment: if you actually read this book, try to imagine making love after what happens physically to both characters just hours before!), I had vowed just to set the book aside and move on to something less silly.  But I soldiered on, hoping foolishly for better writing to come.  Then, at the beginning of Chapter 40, when the same character says, "It still doesn't make any sense," I realized that I was still talking to myself.		If I were to classify this book, I would call it bad fast food.  You think that you're going to enljoy it, then feel sick after consuming the mess.  Too many novels fall squarely into this McNovel genre.  The authors of these trainwrecks can't seem to figure out whether they want to write a cheap knockoff screenplay for "Expendables 4" or a cheap knockoff of a shoot-em-up video game or a cheap knockoff of a superhero comic book.  As a reader, I'm not really going to be the one to figure that out for the writer.  So all I'm willing to commit to is that this novel with only a modicum of novelty is a cheap knockoff of something.		I smile and suspend my disbelief when Bruce Willis or Jason Statham sustain multiple injuries and bounce back to fight again.  Faced with the absurd notions of physical injury in this novel, However, I could only laugh.  And the laugh was full of anger at the author for his disrespect for his readers' basic intellegence.		And here's a conundrum for the writer and his alleged editors.  What if Michael Ratan had lived in the fifth tower of the Taiyang on the eleventh floor in apartment #6?  What slang term would apply to him then?		Hey, Paolo B. is an award winner.  Maybe "The Windup Girl" is fabulous.  I can see it on my bookshelf from here.  However, I'm going to have to take an extended hiatus from his writing.  It's not in me to eat two Whoppers with Cheese without serious consequences to my literary digestion.
1,Too many ridiculously stupid moves by "Stephanie". Felt like no one would be that dumb! Spent most of book hoping it would get better. Does by a little toward the end. Hopefully she wishes up in the next books. Won't be reading them though, was too painful getting through this one.
1,I have not read any Harry Potter books and had no particular expectations. I got the audio book at Cracker Barrel for a long road trip and hoped for the best. I was amazed at how bad this book was. I thought the underlying premise, setting, and characters could have made for great drama. But, ultimately the book is about six dysfunctional families and you pretty much want to strangle all the adults. There is rape, incest, domestic violence, and other unpleasant actions. However, there is no suspense or mystery--when anonymous things occur, she tells you who is doing them as they happen. There are no likeable characters, just unhappy parents, unhappy teenagers, and a lot of bad results. The moral to the story is apparently that at least some people will appreciate each other more and get past their anger once really, really bad things happen. I found the plot boring and probably shouldn't have hung on until the end.
1,When I bought this book I expected it to be a true story.  This wasn't even good fiction.  I'm sorry I wasted my money.  There was nothing about this book that made me believe it was a true or accurate account of a ghost or spirit.
1,This is not needed, just use a regular composition book, don't waste your money.
1,Nothing to say
1,William McKeen's MILE MARKER ZERO is the first non-fiction account of Key West life (that I know of) focused specifically on the interesting transitional period from Navy town (through the 60s) to Spring Break and cruise-ship destination (80s and beyond). As such, it was highly anticipated by this reader. I've been to Key West many, many times and any story told by a long-time Key West resident inevitably ends with the coda, "You really had to be there." McKeen's book, sadly, does little to change that summation. After you set aside the book's rehashing of oft-told tales of the island's Indian/Spanish past (Cayo Hueso) and Papa Hemmingway, plus lengthy off-island accounts of the main protagonists' lives in Montana and Tennessee and Hollywood, you're left with a pretty slim volume. Part of this may stem from the fact that there's just not that much to say about a few years of epic drinking and fishing and more epic drinking.		But McKeen also seems to have stretched too small a canvas. He restricts the narrative to the exploits of Jimmy Buffett, Thomas McGuane, Hunter S. Thompson, Jim Harrison, and Tom Corcoran, but appears to have only spoken to Corcoran and Thompson at any length. Indeed, the exploits are few in number, and many of them are told more than once. The handful of Buffett incidents are mostly cherry-picked from the musician's best-selling memoir, and McGuane appears to have no interest in shedding any new light on the two wasted years that effectively extinguished his reputation as a promising new American novelist. The best parts of the book come from the mouths of Tom Corcoran (who should write his own 70s history of Key West) and Key West lifers like Dinky Bruce. I wished there was more of that stuff. Finally, I don't think you can tell the story of 70s Key West while largely avoiding the explosion of gay culture that transformed the island in radical and extraordinary ways. (And no, the short chapter on Tennessee Williams doesn't count.) In the end, McKeen's MILE MARKER ZERO is a lot like the water just off Smathers Beach: shallow and fairly tepid.
1,Not great.
1,While this is an overly sweet love story, the unreality is off putting. The baby never cries, apparently never eats either, the young boy is awfully perfect, and the harsh gritty life on the Kansas plains never materializes. What put me over the edge, however, was the absurdly ridiculous misunderstanding at the end of the story between the couple. Avoid this sappy treacle if you want real literature.
1,Flowery prose, poor character development and simplistic writing style made this novel of a young Armenian girl in France during WWII difficult to finish.  No amount of embellishment could make this novel come alive and it almost seemed as though the author was reliving the tales of the Armenian genocide from the stories told to her by her family.  I never felt any emotion as the members of her family met tragedy after tragedy and I will not spoil the gist of what these were for others who might wish to read what I found to be a really boring book.
1,Has gotten dull, same ole, same ole. Bored with looking for Cleo.	Does not hold my interest..have not finished it.
1,Like so many others I started reading Lancaster with Bitter is the New Black, which I loved. The other memoirs were enjoyable too--always good for a laugh. Even the Tao of Martha with its sad overtone was still enjoyable, but this book is a BITTER disappointment. Her first fiction book seemed a loosely veiled memoir, weak but ok. These last two, poor and poorer. I applaud the effort and apparent ability to follow her dreams and be a writer, but these "Freaky Friday" plots aren't even good enough for a Disney channel made for TV movie. I bought Twisted Sister because it was a $2.99 Kindle special (kind of telling, no?) and it was still more money than it's worth. This book has poorly written two dimensional characters, a weak overused plot and it took forever to get to the main conflict in the plot and then was resolved in a heartbeat.
1,The illustrations by Eric Puybaret are interesting, unique and imaginative and if there could be a separate rating I'd give them 5-Stars.		Peter Yarrow's singing seemed tired, but was tolerable.		What is absolutely unacceptable are the two words that were noticably "inserted" and sound like a skip!  The original lyrics, "A Dragon lives forever, but not so little boys", have been revised to, "A Dragon lives forever, but not so little GIRLS AND boys."  Gosh, we can't have a song that is only about a little boy?  This poorly executed and tacky revision ruined the book and CD.
1,I had never heard of Sam Wyly before so I had no preconceived notions about him or his history.  From the book's title and description I hoped to learn practical techniques for entrepreneurs.  If this is what you're looking for, I'd look elsewhere.		There are pearls of wisdom found throughout the book where he explains skills he learned while dealing with people or managing a company.  The story of him playing on his high school football team as a 155lb nose guard was a great illustration of the power of pushing yourself and setting goals.  He referred back to that several times when in later years he was fighting against IBM, AT&T's monopoly or other Goliath vs. David conditions.		He recounts a roughly chronological trip through his career.  He starts off in the early days at IBM and Honewell, then goes into great detail about the companies he started, bought or invested in, such as University Computing Center, Bonzanza, Sterling Software and Michaels.		Much of the information he provides in the book makes him appear clairvoyant.  With impeccable timing he managed to sell two companies for $4 billion each when in the same month the stock market tanked by 80%.  While impressive, the descriptions of his feats lack insights into how he managed to do them, other than unsatisfying statements like, "I read a lot."  I would imagine there are hundreds of people who read far more than he does that aren't nearly as timely.  There must be something else he's not telling us.  Perhaps he really doesn't know what it is.  Perhaps he really is clairvoyant.		The organization of the book was hard to follow.  It started off chronologically, but it didn't stay that way.  It was unclear to me when he was dealing with one company or another.  A timeline would have been helpful to understand when everything took place.		His grand tales of success were fun to hear about but left me with little to no understanding of how he achieved what he did.  In the end, the book left me wanting.
1,Just couldn't get into it, didn't even finish it.
1,I admit I only read the first 1  chapters.  I just couldn't get "into" it.  So I might not be the right person to review it.  It simply seemed to go on and on about all things submarine-like in a very boring way.
1,Each video has a 60 second advertisement for Live Lessons at the beginning. You purchased the product, then you need to endure 30 commercials (one before each lesson). Next, you can't watch these on your iPod because the font is so small. I admit that most people will not care about this. But for some of us that commute, and want to watch the videos on a non-computer monitor, forget it. Even on a big monitor (I have a 24") the font is small and hard to read. The Flash video is problematic for Mac users. Even on Windows the Flash player can be problematic. But my biggest complaint was that there is little actual VBA teaching. Most of the lessons are watching Bill show non-VBA stuff in Excel. I am a VBA expert, but am always looking to learn more. And I did pick-up a time or two. ... but watching these videos was boring. Wait till the price drops to $10. Not worth much more.
1,It could have been my mood...I don't know. I'm usually not a critical reader.  I just enjoy books. I just couldn't get into this one. The characters seemed silly. However, whenever I purchase books I always donate them to the local library after I have finished reading them.  I figure if I ever want to read them again I know where to find them. Plus, they are there for others to enjoy...even if I didn't.
1,I could not really get into this book.  I read a lot but it just was so laborious to read that I couldn't get past the first chapter.
1,This was a gift to my daughter (who is noticeably than the target audience) for Christmas.  Since I had it anyway and, as a homeschooler, I often read their literature with them, I decided to give it a try.  I will say, what scored this book 2 stars is the visual presentation of the text; I must admit, it is very cool.  But only a few paragraphs in,  abandoned it.  The premise is absurd and requires more than just dropping into an unfamiliar surrounding with no context.  Heaving over the edge of a boat because your time machine just deposited you there is such a ridiculous way to start a book that it got closed and will likely not be reopened.  Completely uninterested.  One should be drawn in, not turned off.
1,Not for me.
1,I knew it would be small but this is out of the world small. Adorable pictures but not worth the $1.50. More of a 50 cent item. Disappointed.
1,the book was terrible. the story line catches your attention when u read the back of the book,but when you begin reading it its really bad. i was very disappointed,i was hoping it would be better.i want my money back. at times the author picks you up,but then he drops you back down.i guess he got bored.
1,Having recently been converted to the Low Carb life by Gary Taube's excellent and life-changing book - Good Calories, Bad Calories&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Good-Calories-Bad-Calories/dp/1400040787/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Good Calories, Bad Calories</a>&nbsp;- I've been interested in finding cookbooks that would increase my range of food choices while staying within a healthy (for me) daily carb count of less than 40 net carbs. This book isn't it.		As an earlier reviewer noted, a book that uses flour, cornstarch, sugar or regular chocolate, etc. in almost every recipe is NOT low carb. Which is why, no doubt, the serving sizes listed are laughably miniscule. ONE egg for breakfast? I think not.		Worse, I don't believe any of the carb counts in this book can be trusted. Here's the carb count for "nut butter spreads" (made from 2 cups of peanuts for example) on page 56, the serving size for which is 2 tablespoons: 0 grams carbohydrate.		Here's the carb count for "homemade peanut butter" (made from 2 cups of peanuts) on page 250, the serving size for which is 2 tablespoons: 7 grams carbohydrate; 5 net grams.		Huh?		Some plain chicken recipes have carb counts of 1 or 2 grams - yet a serving of plain roasted chicken has 6 grams per serving!		Bottom Line: If you're looking for real low carb recipes save your money and look elsewhere. All this book will do is reduce your bank account and expand your waist.
1,There's a good mystery at the center of this seemingly endless book, but it's surrounded by filler.  Like, what the protagonist ate or the date when she had relations with her husband.  I kept screaming "Get on with it!" at my Kindle, but the trivia kept coming.  I didn't get any sense of who Carly is --how do others in her community regard her?  And all the other characters are underdeveloped, too.  Net result:  I had to fight with myself to finish it and I have no desire to read any more in the series.  Skip this one.
1,Really expected more from this book. It does have some interesting bits, but it lacks depth, does not manage to pull my attention. I develop Web systems for a living and am security-minded, so I might be biased on this, but it is the demographics I think it would most cater to!
1,Book description -- simpleton.  I stopped reading at 70%, I just couldn't push forward anymore.  By this point in the book, there was a quick simple battle (if you want to call it that, no challenge), no sex, no love . . . I just had no feelings for any of the characters in this book.
1,The only way this book can be viewed as helpful or compelling is if it is read as a window into the thought processes of someone who has borderline or narcissistic personality disorder. As several other reviewers noted, the tone is consistently whiny and self-absorbed, with no appreciation of the monumental efforts of her transplant team or freinds and family.		Ms. Silverstein clearly lives in a world where facts and logic are subordinate to feelings: even though she could have produced an insightful narrative about the process of living with a medical "miracle" that has unrecognized adverse impact on quality of life, the book remains mired in self-pity and stubbornness.
1,Outside the city of Amnon, the armies of Far-ad-din and Corajidin face one another in a conflict which is meant to be settled by a ritualistic duel between champions. But Corajidin has other ideas and the conflict escalates into a full-blown battle. Indris, grief and guilt-riddled, persuades Far-ad-din to flee the battle in the hopes that the Shrian rulers will find in his favour after the battle.		I read this book because it was nominated for the Morningstar award which is awarded for the best new entrant into epic fantasy. Each year I read a number of the nominees and every year, I find a few gems. This was not one of them.		The plot is fairly straightforward. Corajidin is a powerful, dying man who believes that more power will allow him to prevent his imminent death. In order to gain more power, he seeks to exploit both political and quasi-religious divides between the political elite. I enjoy fantasy novels that explore political philosophy (a good example being Brandon Sanderson's second Mistborn novel&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Well-of-Ascension-Mistborn-Book-Two/dp/B003XNTTYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Well of Ascension: Mistborn: Book Two</a>) but in this book I found that the political motivation felt very thin and undeveloped. The underlying system is one which is quasi-feudal, quasi-democratic, so there is a lot of potential here, but I found it simply didn't deliver.		The world-building is complex, but is very hard to follow. I read a lot of complex fantasy and science fiction (including Neal Stephenson's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Anathem/dp/B0015DPXKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anathem</a>&nbsp;and George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series) but more experienced authors drip-feed their world-building so that you have sufficient understanding of the world to connect with the characters but not so much that it is overwhelming. In this book, I felt Barnes threw too much at the reader too quickly. I was between 40-60% of the way of the book before I felt like I had a proper grip on what was going on, and even by the end of the book, a lot of aspects felt opaque. There are so many races and nations and houses, it's very hard to follow.		The same issues extend to the characters. All of them are introduced as "awesome" or "mythical" in some way. Now, the races in this world all appear to be long-lived or quasi-immortal, so having them wrack up impressive histories does make some sense. But they all have dozens of different names that are used inter-changeably - there is actually a glossary at the end of the book with all the various names for each character - and it can be difficult to keep track. Plus their characterisation is all quite thin - I struggled to really root for any of them. The three warrior-women in the novel (Shar, Mari and Roshana) feel pretty inter-changeable except for the role each plays in the plot.		There is also a bit of an issue with the magic, referred to as disentropy. There are two groups which can control it - scholars (called the Seq) who do so in a disciplined way to serve humanity, and witches who are undisciplined and dangerous. Both groups share a common Achilles heel, salt-forged steel, which reduces them from extremely powerful to weak and powerless. What doesn't make sense is why any soldier would be without it. Unlike with Superman's Kryptonite, there seems no particular reason why it would be rare.		All in all, the book has some redeeming qualities - the fight scenes are quite good. Many of the warriors have an artistic aspect - such as being warrior-poets or chanters - and this lends the battles quite an interesting feel. Some of the plot points near the end of the novel are interesting or intriguing. But it's all a bit too little, too late.		I think that Barnes has some clear potential and in a few books' time, he may be worth returning to. But, for the moment, I found this book too difficult to read to continue with the series. For readers looking for new epic fantasy writers, I would rather recommend Jay Kristoff's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stormdancer-The-Lotus-War-Book-One/dp/B007XSN05E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stormdancer: The Lotus War Book One</a>, Helen Lowe's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Heir-of-Night-The-Wall-of-Night-Book-One/dp/B004KZOXNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Heir of Night: The Wall of Night: Book One</a>&nbsp;or Rae Carson's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Girl-of-Fire-and-Thorns/dp/B004U6URJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Girl of Fire and Thorns</a>.
1,This autobiography starts with good expectations.  It's the beginning dream that provides the strongest narrative.  However, Bernstein's story soon becomes suspect.  Bernstein admits to complete fabrications in his business dealings (and seems quite proud of his abilities).  This makes you quickly question the veracity of his story.  Also, in recounting his tales, he doesn't come off as a particularly upstanding invidual, nor do his clients.  After many anecdotes, it just feels uncomfortable, and a bit ugly.  (The narrator is good although slightly affected, but it matches the character of the book.)
1,I'm almost ashamed to admit I read this book, as it was such a moronic piece of fiction. My excuse for starting it is that it was a hot topic at the time I read it (2004); my excuse for finishing it (and this is the shameful part, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars) is that it was a decent thriller, in a mindless sort of way--the literary equivalent of Die Hard 2, 3, 4, ... But the book was filled with such ridiculous and inexcusable errors of fact that it took the edge off whatever pulp pleasure I might have otherwise derived from it--and convinced me never to read another Dan Brown book, however desperate for escapist fiction I might become.
1,Did not read
1,Slow read, I was expecting more based on all the 4-5 star reviews.  Never really felt the connection between the H and the h.  She had no idea who he was until the end of the book??  I saw what was coming from the beginning.  No real twist or surprise at all.  Not a bad read, just not that good.  Loved the premise, but it fell short in the delivery.
1,This is not a genre of book I generally enjoy, but my Bible study group wanted to read it, so I read along with them. As anticipated, I found the writing style very touchy-feely and personally unappealing. Most of the advice was dead obvious, but at least it seemed practical and useful for people that need to be told to think before they act on their feelings.
1,The Infinite Sea is a pretty weak sequel to The 5th Wave.  The author abandoned most of the characters introduced in the first book for the majority of the second, so that much of the concern I had for the characters faded and nothing happened before the end to rekindle my interest.  If you cared for Cassie, Sam, Zombie, Evan, Poundcake, Teacup, or Dumbo, you'll wonder - as I have - why the author spent most of the book on Ringer.
1,Let me start off by saying that I am not a devout follower of any particular religion. I was raised Catholic, but over the years, through church, through research, and through my own perceptions, have decided to form my own relationship with God. I am not a proponent of any organized religion, but I believe strongly.		This book held a lot of promise in its story, but I found myself getting completely bogged down the farther into it I went.  As it progressed, I felt less illuminated, and more preached to and lectured. As such, it was too easy for me to lose whatever message the author was trying to convey, and it also degraded my enjoyment of the story. Overall, I think the book could have benefitted from some concise editing in its middle chapters.		I would still recommend the book as a tool to get you thinking or to prompt some good intellectual discourse, but I caution against those who would take it quite literally, or those who don't feel like being preached to for the few hours it will take you to read this.
1,I thought I was purchasing a Western.  The story starts out in England?  Don't remember off hand because it was a while ago that I started reading the story.  I never got past the second chapter so not sure how it evolves into being offered amoung the topic of Westerns.  In all fairness this might have been a great story, just not what I was looking for.
1,Well, she's thorough, that's for sure.  Every possible sewing technique is covered here.  But with only line drawings for relief, it's kinda tedious to get through.  Maybe if you just wanted to look up particular techniques.  Her other books are great, but this one really leaves me cold.
1,The most recent Bibliophile Mysteries are not as consistent as they were in the beginning. Brooklyn and Derek are on the threshold of getting married, but their relationship has gotten too schmaltzy, e.g. Brooklyn melting in his arms. The story revolves around a courtyard of boutiques across from their apartment, and a visit from Dereks parents. Dereks mother Meg is a good addition to the series. Her psychic abilities make her an instant partner-in-crime to Brooklyns mom Becky. The murder book in question is a rare edition of Alice in Wonderland, and as always, Carlisle provides intriguing history of the books publishing history. The downside to this novel is that there is so little action, and the author recaps story elements from this and previous books way too often. The ending is so convoluted even Brooklyn finds it difficult to figure out who is guilty of what. I was originally going to give this a three-star rating, but the book is really a disappointment.
1,Very boring didn't finish it.
1,OMG, I hate this book!  As I write this review I've decided not to even try to finish it.  Once again Gwynne Forster has done a disservice to readers.  This book is supposed to be inspirational but, the only thing it will inspire me to do is to not read another story she writes.	We are given a 34 year-old hero, Dr. Jack Ferguson who is supposed to be a wealthy, educated, noted and respected cardiologist acting like a spoiled child and a spineless 31 year-old heroine, soon to be registered nurse, Melanie Sparks who placates him. I could not relate to either of them and found the dialog between them dated and immature.	It's the same old story, he's a have and she's a have not. After a medical ephiphany he decides to come down to the hood and mingle with the have-nots by opening a clinic and subsequently finds a kindred spirit in Melanie who just happens to need a job while she's getting her nursing degree. Oh and don't forget that after meeting her he then starts to have thoughts about his future meaning a family of his own.	I think Forster was trying as usual to make her hero a sexy alpha-male but once again she only made him come off as needing to be constantly reassured, paranoid, overbearing and annoying. At any time I expected Dr. Jack Ferguson to stomp his foot and hold his breath if he didn't get what he wanted.	Jack and Melanie are totally UNREALISTIC and the author puts them in unrealistic situations.  For instance, why would Jack agree to spend the weekend at his architect's house after just meeting him and his family and then expect Melanie to agree to accompany him which of course she did and she didn't ask one pertinent question as to why and he (Jack) only wanted to do it because he was taken with the architect's precocious six year old daughter? This is just an example of why I found no empathy or support for them or their silly story.	The premise from Forster is always the same, big, handsome, accomplished, strong-willed man has to bend the will of the loyal, unassuming, low self-esteemed, do-gooder woman into doing what he wants. I was just insulted that a publisher would greenlight this mess for publication and shame on Forster for underestimating the reader by once again offering superficial characters with a re-hashed story. Just a real disappointment with two of the most unappealing characters put on paper.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
1,Among the worse is author's exclmation of joy at the end for having finished what was obviously hard work for him. Do something else or keep  opinions to yourself
1,I have to be honest, books written about dogs does not really interest me. I think the story of the crucifixion through the eyes of Barley down plays the seriousness of what Jesus did for us. I received this book from The Fiction Guild and was required to give an honest review.
1,I could not get through this book that came highly recommended to me. WAY too slow.
1,I can't believe that I bought this. It lacks any sense or feeling of truth. If you are an actual person , show yourself.
1,Not only was this the worst retelling of the story of Marilyn Monroe's tragic death,  but the writing itself was just so atrocious I could barely push through an entire chapter without getting a headache,  a stomach ache or both.  Margolis jumps around too much within dialog,  but also reiterates the same confusing points multiple times.  I read about halfway through and gave up.
1,This story dragged on to one climactic moment.  Characters weren't anyone you really cared about.  I finished the book because I always do.  I am not the least bit interested in reading any of the other books in this series.
1,The story line is very brief and the artwork is colorless.  My 2 year old book lover was not interested.
1,The font for the "insertions" in this Bible is very readable, but the font for the text of the Bible is too small.  Also, the text is dark but not black...maybe grey, maybe navy.  The blurbs in the middle of the scripture are just distracting.  Some of them are just stupid:  "If we are only willing to do what is easy, life will always be hard.  If we are willing to do what is hard, life becomes easy."  Seriously?  I don't see how that is biblical in any way.  The maps at the back are nice, and the book intros are pretty good.  I like the timelines.  There is some indication that this Bible has associated "digital resources," but they aren't listed in a particularly helpful format, so I don't see how the associated site is a bonus.  I'm not sure I can trust the "extras" to be true, which makes me say this would not be a Bible I would recommend.
1,This is a short, very graphically emotional story, a little too syrupy for me..a stretch of the imagination.
1,If I were in a stress-induced crisis, this book would have me climbing the wall. I guess I expected a guiding hand, rather than a expos on the things that cause us stress.  Maybe that happens later in the book, but I'm not too hopeful.
1,I am a huge Haines fan. I have read all of Haines books! But this one drug out the Graf and Sarah split way too long! And the child...who didn't know immediately what was coming there?	In my opinion, it was a huge mistake to take Graf out of the equation, let alone turn him into such a jacka--! Too much didn't work in this installment. And maybe went too far to bring it all back around. Sort of a "who shot JR brouhaha". Really sorry to see this sad turn of events as I always looked forward to a  new Sarah Booth caper.	Sorry Carolyn!
1,The contents are great. The binding is ... well, this is supposed to be a hardcover book and something you'd want to keep a long time. I can't really describe this cheap binding as hardcover. It's a blend of soft and hardcover. The spine is nothing but layers of thick paper, and not heavy-duty paper at that. The cardboard is the thinnest that might qualify as hardcover. The first volume is bound improperly so that there are wrinkles and gaps between the cover paper and the front cover cardboard. I'm sending it back, but even if the binding wasn't done wrong the book will have to be handled delicately, and that definitely does not meet expectations for a hardcover cook book. The version I received is a 2-volume set in a cardboard set box. There are more than one two volume sets on Amazon so it may be hard to find the best product. The title of this inferior item is "Mastering the Art of French Cooking (2 Volume Set)" The outer box is white with red fleur-de-lis, and matches volume 1. Volume 2 in this set is white with teal fleur-de-lis. There is another set named (2 Book series) which I'm going to try instead.
1,Like others have said, it jumps from easy words to ridiculously hard sentences. Also, you start learning to count from 20, which is okay since I know how to count in Spanish, but someone learning might want to be able to count from 1.
1,I read  only a small portion of the book and could not go any further.  Why do authors think they have to be so graphic with the sex?  It really does not anything to the story.  Judy
1,I tried to like this book; I really, did.  But the author's style comes across to me as arrogant.  Personally, I like my non-fiction as free from sardonic comments as possible, and this text is absolutely riddled with them.  There is no doubt about the axes this author has to grind - he makes them clear - and unfortunately I think this hinders an otherwise interesting theory.
1,I know Catherine Coulter treads a not so fine line,  but in this case her 'hero' is a serial rapist,  who,  when unduly angered by women,  takes them by force.  He is consistently awful to his wife and then in the last 10 pages,  for no apparent reason, totally changes his tack and decides to love her.	I'm never really sure why she loves him,  aside from his physical strength, for there is little that is admirable or lovable about him.  This is not a tortured soul looking for healing through love,  this is a cruel,  quite stupid man who raped a woman in a previous novel,  and then rapes his wife in this one.	This one goes straight into the resale pile.
1,While the premise for this series sounded good the execution is severely lacking.		Here are just some of the notes that I made while reading this...		At 18% into the story there is this, incomplete sentence....  "Is there anything you else, because I'm leaving."		At 24%*sigh* Man this needs a decent editor. One that understands proper sentence structure and proper tenses. And I really don't see the need for the set up for 2 other couples should be taking place in the first quarter of this book. SMH"		At 35% "shoving aside the lingering aches" Give me a break! He needed help dressing that morning, he just asked for help dressing a few minutes ago and yet suddenly he can slam a guy against the wall and only has "lingering aches"?! SMH..		At 37% "This author should do her her homework. That was NOT a flashback and any idiot would know that! That's not how flashbacks go at all!		Still at 37% after being shot and burned in the evening we're told that they're back home by 2am with no prescriptions, no real details about his injuries other than shot and burned. .... SMH....		With a decent editor and decent proofreader this probably could have been decent. However, sadly, that's not the case and I'm just left questioning the validity of the statement that this author is a NY Times best seller.
1,I didn't realize that this was a tiny pocket-sized book.
1,Thrilling - kind of story you could not put book down the suspense had you reading and reading without s stop!
1,Parts of this book were entertaining, and parts were too juvenile to be entertaining.  The insights into Thad Motta and several of his star players were interesting.  I think I now understand why the Buckeyes will never win the national championship in basketball....
1,Maybe in a different era this book was a gem, but nowhere near by today's standards.  Therefore, I don't think this book fits the definition of a classic.  Like many others, I first learned about and decided to read the book because of Raylan in the FX series Justified.  I figured if the pen-ultimate bad a$$ Raylan heavily endorsed it, this must be an outstanding crime novel.  Needless to say, I was disappointed, but found comfort in the fact that this novel was short.  Very little character development, and at times confusing since some characters were referred to not by their name, but a descriptor of what they looked like, e.g. "The stocky man", or sometimes with no descriptor; simply "The Man" (two of them in one dialogue).
1,The premise of multiple personalities is highly questionable by the medical community.  Given that fact the possibility and odds of 22 different personalities in a person is infinitesimal.  It should also be noted that the family of this lady find the actions of the therapist highly questionable.  All the monies of the sales of the book goes directly to therapists( if you want to call her that ). The therapist had her subject sign over all rights to her story with no money whatsoever going to the patient.  The question being is the therapist encouraging the subject to believe all the b.s. shes writing as a means of profiting from this broken lady?  This author comes across as quite a parasite and appears to be force feeding the subject all and anything that would sensationalize her afflictions in order to make the book more attractive to possible buyers.  This was a library book for me and I would never contribute to this opportunists bank account.  Save you money and keep you time for other things.
1,Have read better. Not my favorite.
1,Even the best papal potboilers are clich ridden:  The "black horse" who is elected through the intervention of the Holy Spirit, and who's threatened by an assassination or grave illness; the wise and wily Secretary of State; the evil member of a right wing Roman Catholic organization modeled on Opus Dei; the priest with a crisis of conscience - usually in the area of celibacy; the astute journalist looking for God through a story, who may or may not be the lapsed Catholic being drawn back to the fold.  Greg Tobin gave us the clichs in "Conclave," which was not great, but at least readable, and he repeats them all to less effect in "Council."  Mr. Tobins' characters just don't rise above clich, and regardless of the author's efforts to fill in with back-story, they're one dimensional throughout.  But characters are only part of the problem with this book.  The plot is telegraphed, the sex scenes are awful, trivial incidents are over elaborated, and attempts at weaving memory with "real time" stop rather than illuminate action or character.		The author does have a few ideas about the politics of putting a "Vatican III," together, and about how the event might turn out, but even these portions of "Council," are not adequately developed.	The book begins with the incidents of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, and though those events help define one of his characters the novel seems to suffer from an opening that was opportunistically tacked in; or a book that was only a year in the writing and opportunistically published as close to the year anniversary of 9/11 as possible.  If the former, then shame for writing a bad book and merchandising it around the horror of 9/11; if the latter, shame anyway for a rush job that`s barely readable.	"Council," also seems like book two of a series - perhaps a trilogy - and leaves events unresolved for the next installment.  I am a sucker for papal potboilers, so I'll probably read a third installment, used or remaindered, but in the meantime I'll say three Hail Mary's in the hope that book three ("Conciliation"?) doesn't repeat the purgatory of "Council."
1,This book had a an interesting story line to begin with, but it became very disjointed.  It lost the story line to focus on entirely different people and unrelated events.
1,Nonfiction books can viewed differently by each individual person who reads them. This one just did not speak to me.
1,The book was more about the author than the Clintons.  I was a little disappointed in it.
1,I liked Fated. The beginning really caught my interest, I liked Daire, and I thought the Native American religion theme was fresh and different. So I was excited to continue with Echo.	But I soon became very frustrated! First of all the antagonist, Cade, disappears from the book. There is no tension filled interaction with the bad guy, nothing to move the plot along. All you are left with is almost the entire book of two whiney kids crying about how much they love each other but can't be together. Which makes no sense at all. They can't be together because their fated, pure love makes the missing bad guy stronger. Nobody ever questions this, and it is not explained. I thought it was a universal truth that love fights evil, makes it weaker. Guess not, but then I was never told why.	Half way through the second book Noel decides to start narrating from Dace's point of view as well. This wasn't a problem, many authors use it very effectively.  In fact I was hoping this would add depth to Dace's character. He was very flat to me. However I was disappointed. The only thing this did was made me question why Dace, with the pure soul, just wanted to be more evil like his brother. You never got an understanding of who he was or his thought process. Oh, but Dace with the pure soul lost his virginity at 14 to some sketchy girl. Really? I'm not one to be a prude about sex in books, but really?	Daire continues to gain new powers, that don't ever seem to be useful to her. I wish that the writing would have been more descriptive, grab my interest more. But much of the narrative seemed very bland and unimaginative. The trials she goes through, the other dimensions, could have been a lot more detailed or even thought through. There is very little explanation of all the "Magick".	This second book dragged and dragged. A lot of times the second book in a series seems to be only filler and plot development, but hopefully leaves you wanting to find out what happens. Unfortunately Noel is dragging this out for two more books, and I just can't make myself care at all about what happens.
1,Stories lacked imagination and story development. The characters lacked personality and were poorly developed. Expected much more from the author of the Potter books which I thoroughly enjoyed. Even Dumbledore's journal lacked the metriculous detail and explanations that one would expect from the head of Hogwarts.
1,I debated alot about whether or not to read Clarity. After deciding that alot of the books I've read and ended up loving probably had underwhelming synopses too I thought I'd give it a go- also, the majority of reviews on Goodreads were fairly positive, always a good sign.		Right of the bat I was annoyed by the characters' names. Starla, Periwinkle and Clarity Fern? Really? A bad choice of names can be ignored though and I thought I'd just keep reading and hopefully the writing and the plot would make up for it.		Recently, in a lot of teenage fiction I've noticed that alot of authors feel the need to insert this stereotypical big boobs/blonde cheerleader bitch skank whore type. Kim Harrington is no exception. The slut shaming in Clarity is thinly veiled and frankly, disgusting. Clare, it is not your business who your brother chooses to hook up with! Clare is so incredibly pretentious and uppity it's annoying.		When discussing her brother's looks she says;		This combination is evidently a recipe for the loosening of morals in almost all girls. Perry spends most of his time chasing girls and hooking up. 		and then discussing one of her brother's "friends"		My names Jinnie! she said in a bubbly voice, thrusting her chest out with delight. I guessed she was about sixteen and not a mathlete.		So Harrington doesn't overtly call these girls sluts (though when Clare finds out something about Perry she does say that she is "furious at Perrys whorish ways for causing it all.)		Apart from Harrington's depiction of Tiffany- the "psychotic skankbag" the majority of the other female characters in the novel (bar Starla and Madame Maslov), Harrington's writing itself is the main reason I did not enjoy Clarity. It's hard to describe exactly what it is about it that is so bad but it is distinctly "teenage" sounding. The following quotes should help show what I mean:		"Perry gave my knee the claw under the table, a warning telling me not to give this jerk the claw on his face." (What does this even mean? Maybe I'm reading it wrong but to me this makes no sense.)		"Yes, I live on the Cape and don't eat seafood. It's a crime, I know."		and when talking about the love interest (?):		A new hottie joining my school. Nice."	"Gabriel Toscano. Damn. Even his name was sexy.		Yeah, I was Clare Fern, tough psychic chick, member of the freak family. But if they stripped all those labels off, people might be shocked to find a normal girl beneath. Who doesnt want to spend her days on the defensive. Who wants what everyone else wants.		To be loved.		UGH seriously puh-lease! You would think that by now people would have quit it with the special snow flake crap but no. Also, Clare is kind of a bitch. She leads on like three guys, openly admits to using them for information and hardly feels guilty. (Not a real date, I continued. I was using him.) Did I mention that blasted love triangle? I felt the romance, in all aspects fell incredibly flat. Seems a bit hypocritical to be that Clare hates Tiffany because she drunkenly hooked up with her boyfriend and strongly disapproves of Perry's no strings sex when she's leading on multiple different guys which is much worse in my opinion.		Clare spends the majority of the book complaining about how badly she's treated by the town and bitching about her brother. Not to mention that she's just accepted onto a MURDER investigation and allowed access to all the crime scenes, she is sixteen in what world would this be allowed? Sorry but my disbelief cannot be suspended that far.		Nothing is resolved in the end except for the murders which in itself had no shock impact, the romance is barely there too. There is talk of all the other psychic families in town but none of them are brought into the investigation and as soon as another psychic comes to town she is immediately labelled a phony? Clare's 'gift' was barely there and hardly added to the story at all except to provide some clues to the investigation that would have been unveiled (probably) anyway. Maybe if I read it when I was younger I would have enjoyed it more.		In conclusion, I found Clarity to be badly written with an unbelievable plot and a disappointing romance.
1,(Two-and-a-half-stars)  At one point in his overlong, overwrought memoir, Eggers trumpets the virtues of self-absorption.  "My feeling is that if you're not self-obsessed you're probably boring," he writes.  Whatever the truth of that self-serving statement might be, his book is proof-positive that self-absorption alone does not a gripping memoir make.  Eggers and his crew of well-bred neohippie pseudo-philosophers believed themselves, in the mid-90s, to be at the vanguard of a new literary order.  The revolution has been slow in coming, but with the publication of this book and his quarterly magazine, McSweeney's, Eggers's brand of tongue-in-cheek navel-gazing appears to be gathering quite a following among the more literate members of Generation X.  To the extent AHWOSG is predictive of the kind of fiction this "movement" will produce, however, I consider it a terrible waste.  Eggers is a talented writer, no question.  But instead of employing his substantial gifts in the service of something serious and meaningful, he settles for flip "observations," strained irony, and shallow self-indulgence.  Make no mistake--the first chapter of AHWOSG is very, very good and very, very moving.  As for the rest of the book, the strongest parts are those in which Eggers rises above himself to describe or imagine the thoughts and feelings of others-Toph and his parents, most notably.  The rest of the book is, alas, a tedious display of the author's quirks and neuroses and floor plans of his various apartments.  At one point, Eggers makes some genuinely funny observations about MTV's "The Real World" and its singular role in laying bare the worst of the emptiness and pettiness of Generation X.  But AHWOSG is little more than "The Real World" in book form, perhaps with a slight boost in intelligence.		I wanted to like this book a great deal.  That it received such glowing praise from almost every literary quarter astounds me.  Maybe my taste in writing is thoroughly passe.  Maybe I miss the days when writers--even ambitious young writers like Eggers and his McSweeney's crew--struggled to distill and encapsulate the world outside themselves.  But this new age of novel-gazing, arch in-jokes, and blatant self-promotion bores me to tears.  This book could have been inestimably better--but only if it was about 300 pages shorter.
1,Despite books with a lot of formatting are usually suboptimal in the Kindle, this one includes a lot of tiny text comments embedded into the postures images. You can't zoom the images, and and least in my case it is very difficult if not impossible to read those comments. This is a great book, content is five starts, but buy the printed version.
1,I'd heard that this was a very scary book. The French government had even jailed the members of the Invisible Committee of authors for Terrorism. I found the book incredibly nave. The most surprising lesson I gleaned from it was that French Socialism is not very popular in France among a large number of its residents. In fact the people sharing the beliefs of the "invisible" authors hate the government system. The book reads like a committee creation. It's an illogical and "pie-in-the-sky" utopian urban myth--ridiculous beyond belief.	 The book itself is only136-pages long and most of it is not only boring, boring, boring but also silly. It's a reprint of a French publication and therefore reflects the warped world of absurd, obscure politics. I was surprised to learn that The MIT Press distributes it. It consists of an introduction and twelve chapters each with many sub-sections.	 The text is obviously written by intellectual elites who think that they will take over the world and live in small rural communes once they have destroyed the cities. They laugh at the fact that all food production is handled by only 2 per cent of the population while at the same time mentioning several times that the members of their post-revolution communes will have to raise their own food in order to survive. This particular discussion reminded me of Mao's Culture Revolution and Pol Pots driving of all Cambodians out of the cities into the countryside to become serfs while systemically killing anyone who could read, write or had professional skills.	 I could visualize the book's authors leading their small band of commune comrades out of the burning cities and suddenly discovering the armed farmers in the countryside weren't interested in surrendering their land to a bunch of lazy city folk. And of course, the radicals also assumed that while their revolutionaries were destroying the internet computer networks and all other modern communications and supply lines, they didn't accidentally cause a few of France's Nuclear Reactors to melt down and irradiate all of France and most of its neighboring nations.	 So assuming these new revolutionary communes can take the farmland away from it's owners, then they would get to farm it. So instead of 2% of the population supplying all their food, most of the commune would be needed for basics. That would mean every comrade would have to work and here's some of what the book says about work.	 "No question is more confused, in France, than the question of work. No relation is more disfigured than the one between the French and work. Go to Andalusia, to Algeria, to Naples. They despise work, profoundly. Go to Germany, to the United States, to Japan. They revere work."	 "We accept the necessity of finding money, by whatever means, because it is currently impossible to do without it, but we reject the necessity of working. Besides we don't work anymore..."	 These guys are going to make wonderful members of their Utopian communes after they have destroyed civilization and returned to the Stone Age. They have another subchapter entitled "Get organized in order to no longer have to work." Apparently they don't feel there will be any work involved in organizing an insurrection or revolution and then living in communes out in the countryside.	 Mostly this book is like reading warped, misunderstood New Age Gobbly-Gook. The authors are so fascinated in listening to themselves expound their utopian theories that only the French elites would have the patience to wade through the pools of garbage flowing out of the sewers of these visionless amateur revolutionaries. They criticize Al Gore and his global warming theories as promoting only another form of capitalism using a crisis to further tax and control. They are equal opportunity haters. They hate the French government, they hate the educational system, they hate capitalism, they hate the unions and they hate the socialists as well as the rightists. They seem to hate, hate, hate everything and simply want to bring it down without any real vision to replace it with. Even their concepts of Communes are vague and sound like temporary alliances that would be in constant flux. it's not exactly going to appeal to masses of people who would just as soon settle for a job and some respect because they have much too much time on their hands.	 Saul Alinsky's "Rules for Radicals" frightened me because his plan for destroying American Capitalism seems to have succeeded beyond his wildest dreams (please feel free to read my Amazon review of that manual for anarchy). One of Alinsky's biggest disciples is in the White House's Oval Office. This French revolutionary manual doesn't frighten me at all, although I can see why the French Government feels threatened by it. These malcontents are dangerous precisely because they just want to destroy, destroy, destroy. I've just finished reading Mike Dash's "The First Family: The Birth of the American Mafia." After Dash's excellent description of how the Mafia was organized in Sicily and then transported to America, I would predict that if these revolutionaries happened to live through their own violent French Revolution it would only be a matter of time before thugs organized like the Mafia would kill and enslave all of them and then the survivors would have a reason to work, if they wanted have enough to eat to barely subsist that is. These radicals would not even begin to approach the cold-blooded tactics of the Sicilian or Russian Mafia. The disorganized French anarchists would be murdered or enslaved before they knew what had happened. The mafia types aren't interested in destroying everything. They just want to make huge profits by allying themselves with the government, rich land owners and industrialists.	 The items that most surprised me about this book were the naivety of the book's utopian authors, the obvious widespread unhappiness with French Socialism, and some of the popular political philosophies passing for logical thinking. One subchapter reminded me of a recent White House Chief of Staff's comment. The book heading was "Make the most of every crisis." That statement scared me a little, but the rest of the book is too boring and confusing to interest, much less inspire, many other revolutionaries.
1,The whole series repeats what was written in book one. I had bought the whole series and was so disappointed that all the books just repeated what was in book one. I returned them all and got my money back.
1,I bought this book as "new" and although the patterns are still sealed, the corners were a bit bent. I bought this book "new" as a gift and now I have to suck it up and gift as is. Not happy!
1,Ok for a quick read.kind of interesting. Need a stronger storyline. Read some Lee Child or Harlan Coben. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
1,*******************might be some minor spoilers******************		Three times I put down this book to read something else, and I probably should have given up, but I kept thinking it would start making sense.  I read the Rook & Ronin trilogy, and while I didn't love it, I liked it enough to read something else from the author.		This book read like the author came up with 50 sex scenes (not all of which seemed consensual, yuck) and then tried to write a story around them.  And honestly, the suspense part of the story didn't make much sense, not even after all the explanations at the end.  Ark was an a******, Blue was dumber than a rock, and JD was like a big slobbering dog who just wanted to be petted a lot (when he wasn't being a total pervy creep).  There was no one for me to like or root for.		There were definitely some eye roll worthy moments, like the tens of millions of dollars Ark makes for amateur porn.  And how he was able to do his "real job" for four years at the same time?  Or the fact that Blue graduated top of her class from an Ivy League school  (top of her class!!!!) and can't find a single job.  Considering who her father turned out to be, that seems even more stupid.  How about how the FBI just destroys some evidence to protect someone, like it's just a minor favor.		If you're looking for a lot of sex scenes and you don't want to think much about a plot (or have it make sense), this might work for you.  Otherwise, I'd skip it.
1,I was terribly disappointed in this. I guess I should have read the title more literally, because that is exactly what you're getting.  A table of contents...with no content.
1,i never got to read this bc i didn't know if i had time restraints so read all there is about the time frame which i did not so 'my bad"
1,Sam's attitude sucks .  I don't like her character.  I don't understand why nick or any man should put up with that.  They are supposed to be equals.  Not her thinking she can always kick his ass.  Nick needs a backbone with her.
1,I couldn't even get through the first chapter so I can't properly critique this book.  I always try to finish a book even if it's not hold my interest.  This book was impossible for me finish.
1,Reader was difficult to listen to. There was one person doing all voices, and they were  difficult to differentiate.
1,i did not find the diagrams easy to follow.  this is the first time i have ever been dissatisfied with a 'for dummies' book.
1,This story did not flow well for me, but was glad to have read it then decided to give the second book a try and was pleasantly surprised. Give it a try, the following books are worth the read.
1,This review is focused on my experience with the audiobook version, although I bought both and feel confident that the review applies to both version.		Bottom line	If your kid is *ALREADY CALM* at bedtime then maybe this will work.  Its approach is essentially hypnotic/suggestive, describing Roger, but then switching whether the story is about Roger or "you" (i.e. your kid).  Seems to work for some people, based on other reviews. But if your trouble with bedtime is that you kid bounces around, gets out of bed, keeps asking questions, needs to tell you something critically important, demands water, has to go potty, etc - then this won't work.  Your kid has to be cooperative enough to sit still and actually pay attention to a very slow story that has no real story.  I have listened to the audio book at least 5 times now.  Roger is very sleepy.  He has to go see Uncle Yawn.  That's all I remember from a 30 minute audio book, because it's mostly just a description of being tired.		Basic Approach	The book describes Roger as  "exactly the same age as you, not older, not younger" and starts the story slowly about how tired Roger is, how he imagines playing on the playground and falling asleep while swinging, how sleepy he is ...  And then after a bit, it gets SNEAKY! suddenly your child is there with Roger and the story bounces between 3rd person and 2nd person.  "All the sounds were making Roger ... and you ... sleepy."  Every other sentence seems to end with "Now."  Like "Roger ... and you ... are ready to fall asleep.  Now. "		Our Experience	My 3-year-old is "high energy" at bedtime (ok ... all the time ...).  We do a routine with bath and teeth brushing and PJs and story time ... but she's usually still wired. I sat with her in bed and played the audiobook.  But she wanted nothing to do with it and tried to jump around in bed instead, talking about anything other than bedtime or the story.  The story is not magic enough to make her listen to it if she doesn't want to. The battle to get her to stop and listen to this *very slow/content-less* story felt exactly like the battle to get her to go to sleep.  In general, when she finally does stop long enough to lay quietly in bed, she falls asleep quickly because she's usually exhausted by that point.  I'm describing this because I'm sure some people will recognize their own kid in this description, and may have a better sense for whether this will work for them.  If your kid won't sit still to listen to a very slow story, this will not work.		I listened to this alone the other night, and yes, next thing I knew it was 4am and my laptop was next to me on my bed, drained of power. But I don't have trouble falling asleep, and I wanted to fall asleep.		So I recognize the merit in the suggestive approach.  But for so many people, bedtime isn't about insomnia.  It's not about a kid who is trying to fall asleep and just can't.  It's about a kid who doesn't want it to be bedtime.  It's about a kid who wants to come out and play because she's 3 and the world is still new and exciting.  It's about a kid who is going to roll her eyes when you start reading a book that is slow and fairly transparent.  Does your kid actually want to fall asleep?  Well then this might be great for you.  But as it's positioned as some miracle powder that will end bedtime battles  ... it falls short.  It will not work if your kid won't cooperate.  I wish it did.  My kid fell asleep after 45 minutes ... halfway through the second reading of it.  45 minutes is no different than any other night.  She's a toddler and fights bedtime until she's too exhausted to fight it.  Book or no book.  Sorry to be a downer.  Really wish this *was* magic.
1,Kept in the Dark is the debut novel of British author Penny Hancock. It was published in Great Britain as Tideline, an equally apt title. I received this book from LibraryThing EarlyReviewers program. As Always I am grateful for the opportunity to receive a free book, especially one that I would probably not otherwise happen upon.		However-this is one of the few books I could not actually finish. It tells the story of the abduction of a 15 year old boy by a woman he has met briefly. In an unusual take on the abduction theme, it is written from the point of view of the abductor. I read the first third of the book and skimmed the rest. I wanted to see what happened to the characters, but I could just not read it all. It was too, too creepy for me.		So-I really can't recommend it or not recommend it. I'll just say if you like this type of book, go ahead and give it a try.
1,Beach read if you are going on spring break from a not so smart college to a not so smart beach.
1,I found "Uncovered" disappointing.  Not for the lack of art from the manga (it's unauthorized, after all - see the fine print on the cover), but for failing to uncover much of anything.  Personally, I'm OK with spoilers for volumes that aren't yet out in English, but if you're up-to-date with English releases of the manga, you know 95% of this already.  You may even find yourself writing corrections in the page margins, as I did.  There's at least one significant contradiction - one statement early in the book (Akito is accepted as the zodiac god because Akira said Akito is the god) is completely overturned late in the book (several zodiac Sohmas knew Akito would be born because they shared a dream of meeting their god).  It would have been easy to catch and correct, and I'm not impressed.		There isn't a lot here, either.  The print is surprisingly large, and there's a good deal of white space on each page - this is a very thin 183 pages.  The text lays out basic facts, but offers scant insight or analysis.  I expected more, given all the Japanese material that's available; honestly, I'd send people to Wikipedia before I'd recommend this book.  To be blunt, I was left with the impression that the authors were assigned to summarize a series they weren't familiar with, and decided to publish their notes.  I bought this out of curiosity, but I'd urge people to get the "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fruits-Basket-Fan-Book-Cat/dp/1427802939/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fruits Basket Fan Book - Cat -</a>" instead - while it doesn't cover the full series, it's jammed with art, character profiles, summaries, relationship charts, and new material.  You'll get a lot more from the "Fan Book" than you'll find in "Uncovered".
1,Dont waste your time. Read almost all of Stephen Frey books. But is by far the worst. Its getting boring always the same theme. Couldnt finish finis it
1,We only read a few chapters and it was so disconnected , we quit!  Avid readers, my wife reads to me every afternoon at 1700 while we enjoy a glass, or so, of wine and savor a good story and/or mystery. This one never got started and was not worth the effort.
1,I've tried to read this book a couple of time.  Made myself finish it this time.  Pure fabrication would have been better.
1,I believe Clements and bought the book thinking it would arm me for intensive discussions about income unfairness made worse by this supreme court (lower case on purpose).  However, it does not read as a newspaper or NPR commentary. It is an academic study of events which is of little purpose to this layman.
1,This was frustrating! It started out ok and then fell off I just wanted it to be over at the end.
1,He labours the obvious. As for the style, it strikes me as ingratiating, self-indulgent, condescending almost. Brits trying to write hip for the American market are liable to affect this pose. I find it obtrusive
1,The book is supposed to be poetic, but is simply tedious and drawn out.
1,Draining the swamp?  Or contributing yet more swam creatures?  This book was published in 2017.  What's been happening these past 6 months?  The book now needs to be rewritten.
1,The book just stops, no conclusion. The store is totally unresolved. Very unsatisfying.  Is the entire series like this? Boo.
1,To predictable and the ending was poor.  Not up to Griffins usual standards.
1,I have liked other books by the author so it make me even more dissatisfied with this one. Besides the annoying editing\gramatical errors, the story was terrible. There is no depth to Tyler. There is no mention of any family or anything. In addition the story is flawed on so many levels, making it highly unlikely. After finding out he may or may not have had unprotected sex with random women, there wasn't any safety concern of STDs and April decides she will have unprotected sex with him too? And the career choices... All so frustrating as if there are alternative solutions. I hate leaving bad reviews so I will just stop it here.
1,There are people in this world that are so convinced they see something when nothing exists, and they will go to any length to try to convince you that what they see is actually there.  Similar to the way a 85 lb teenager purges herself after eating because she sees on obese person in the mirror, this pathetic excuse for journalism makes me inclined to write a book of my own, given that anybody can make money these days, just so long as they purport to "expose" a Muslim or the religion of Islam as something other than peaceful.
1,Very little insight here and not much discussion of political situations
1,I'm not going to spend a lot of time writing a long review here. It's not that it was a *bad* book; it just wasn't a *good* book.		Plot summary: young woman becomes an assistant in a dream study, only to find out that things are (as they say) "not as they seem." There is intrigue and romance. The inside-baseballish talk about dreams is interesting and well done. The prose aims to be smart, and it mostly succeeds.		But it's also an ambitious story, and here it falls short. I have no doubt that Benjamin is going to be a very talented novelist. But in Anatomy, her reach exceeds her grasp. The third act in particular feels too long, and works too hard to tie up every single loose end. A tighter ending and some ambiguity wouldn't have been a bad thing.		If you are really interested in dreams, it's probably worth a look. Otherwise, pass. Though it might be worth keeping an eye out for her next book.
1,Poor reproduction quality.  Actually no quality.  Not approved by the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust.
1,by Lilly		I've recently become obsessed with Elton John. In fact, my iTunes counter says that I've listened to his Madman Across the Water album over fifty times. Now, this really has no relation to the story, other than the fact that the aforementioned album makes a great soundtrack while you're reading Paula Morris' newest novel, Dark Souls. So, if you were wondering what you should listen to while reading Dark Souls, there you have it.		Dark Souls follows Miranda Tennant, a young Iowan who sees ghosts. Miranda's paranormal sightings turn ultra-spooky when her parents, in an attempt to help Miranda and her brother recover from a recent tragedy, take the whole family on a vacation to York, England. There Miranda meets a host of interesting characters, but realizes that she has issues of her own to solve before she can go about solving everyone else's problems.		Dark Souls is the compilation of several ghost stories and myths, tied together with the stereotypical binding of a damaged lead female and her dark, brooding leading man. And while Miss Morris appears to have made an earnest attempt at a ghost story, she ends up with a weak, watery story that is easily consumed and even more easily forgotten. Dark Souls is a rather flat, single-layered story that lacks both emotion and personality.		When it comes to characters, Morris' creations seem to exist only in their external conflicts. Their personalities are completely reliant on tragedy; apart from their doom and gloom, Miranda & co. are totally empty. Their thoughts and emotions are rarely breached, instead being substituted with marvelously crafted backstory.		Backstory: that is the one thing Dark Souls seems to excel at. The characters' histories and relations are brilliantly conceived and written, which is quite a shame; if Morris could have vested that much talent into the rest of the book, we'd be looking at a book comparable in gothic-ness and character development to Dickens' A Christmas Carol.		Dark Souls has its highs and its lows; but the lows unfortunately outnumber the highs.
1,I haven't read it, but the person that I gave it to who is a dyed in the wool quilter and I thought she would really like it told me this evening that it was hard for her to get into.  That surprises me greatly because it's only a small book, so until I can read it I best not	declare.  Darlene
1,I began reading this series and loved it but now I begin to wonder where the writter that wrote those first books went? I've seen this happen before but it's frustrating to read something in a book and think wait.. did i miss something. I actually pulled out previous books to see where I misunderstood something and I didn't. Worse was suddenly I can longer recognize the actions of main characters.. and so many books in this isn't acceptable. I did not like this book. I don't plan on buying any future books by this author.
1,This book is pretty generic. It is way too predictable and the prose is quite boring! Not worth the buy at all!
1,This book tells you a lot of what to do but not how to do what's needed.  The other thing that is sorely missing is an index in the back of the book so that if you want to find information; you can refer to the index.  What was this author thinking??
1,I wish I could tell you I loved this book, but I didn't, and so I'll do my best to explain why.		The story is told in two timelines that seem to compete more than to complement each other. All four women from 'The High Tide Club' have narrating parts in the past timeline, and their stories meander, providing so much extraneous detail that it distracts from the present. The present timeline is told mostly from Brooke's perspective, and also gets caught up in the tendency to wander outside the point of it all. The result is a story that lacks cohesion and focus.		We have a whole lot of characters, but none of them are particularly well developed or likable. Many feel like stereotypes, and all behave in stereotypical ways.		By the time we get to the twists and all is unveiled, I wasn't the least bit surprised. We spend so much time in the past, with so much detail provided, that it's like having neon signs point the way. It's all there if we pay the slightest bit of attention.		The content should have been powerful enough to move me to tears, yet I didn't feel any emotion at all. Part of this, I think, is explained by the lack of character development. The characters seem devoid of reaction and emotion, and so, as a reader, it's impossible to feel more deeply than the characters themselves.		Overall, the story has the feel of a daytime soap opera. In fact, the characters themselves even make that comparison a few times. The major difference is that daytime soaps are all about drama and emotion, while this story has the drama without the emotional investment.		*The publisher provided me with an advance ebook copy, via NetGalley, in exchange for my honest review.*
1,Robert Harris is one of my favorite authors. However, his latest book "Dictator" is nothing more than a very dry recap of his first two books in his Ancient Rome series. As a result, I speed read the last half of this novel. Save your money!
1,This fan fiction is too far afield of the original to please me.  There are only the faintest hints of the tension between Elizabeth and Darcy and of the inner conflict each of them has.  Not my cup of tea.
1,I know full well that I cannot expect to 'really like' every book that I pick up, but I was particularly disappointed in this one.  I bought it to give myself something 'lighter' to read, to give myself a break, to just sit back and be entertained.  It was a little hard to get into it at first, but after about 50-60 pages, I found that I was interested enough to keep going.  When I was finished, I was left with the feeling that I should have gone with my initial instinct, to set it aside early on.	The jacket blurbs tout the slow, inexorable buildup to a 'PSYCHO-like tension.  Ms. White is not without talent (and, with 10 other books to her credit, she most likely has loyal readers), but I think this story would have been better-served as a film, or perhaps as a made-for-TV movie, complete with a few recognizable personalities venturing outside of their regular roles in their attempts to 'stretch out' as actors.	I have to agree with another reviewer, who cited their feeling that the author suddenly increased the pace of the story when she decided it was time for it to be over.  There were far too many questions raised that were left unanswered, too many issues touched upon that were never resolved.  The main character's relationship with Oliver feels extremely 'forced' from a literary point of view -- and whatever becomes of Dave?  Ms. White birngs up some interesting and vital points about the social services field, as well as some psychological insight into depression and codependency.  It's obvious that she is sensitive to these issues, and even knowlegeable -- but no real conclusions are drawn, no solutions suggested.  Painting the experience without offering any real guidance or options makes it appear as nothing more than a device to inject emotion and tension into a very rambling work.	It's almost as if the author were whipping up the book from a recipe, saw that the book she was cooking needed to be 'on the table', and popped it into the microwave at the end.  I was left with the impression that my reading experience suffered because of someone else's deadline -- perhaps she even lost interest in her own story toward the end.	I think the next time I want something that is both entertaining and genuinely terrifying, I'll pick up a copy of THE LOTTERY or something else by Shirley Jackson -- I know for a fact that it'll still scare the hell out of me after all these years, and it'll be worth my time.
1,This is not a review of the book, which is a classic. It is a review of this edition, which has been put out on Amazon's self-publishing format CreateSpace. The thing that one does not know when purchasing this book is that each page consists of a double column of text. (See photo.) Maybe some people like this, but I don't. The lines of type are too long to be newspaper style but too short to be the length of a line of type in a normal book. I don't really like reading a book like this, thus the low rating. ps I also think it is deceptive of the publisher to not show any of these pages in the "Look Inside" sample that Amazon provides. pps The translator is not named. Seems unprofessional.
1,Just in case I write spoilers, please don't read on.		Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me begin.		Right off the bat, my eyes were rolling. My mouth let out an audible groan. I knew this novella was not going to be a good one. I mean for example after seeing a guy riding on a bike, Emily declared she was in love with the guy. Oh my freaking God. Lust does not equate with love. Then the whole entire novella spiraled down the whole cliche way. Evil ex-boyfriend (Evan). A good ex-boyfriend (Luke) who then becomes a will they or won't they. Then there is the whole part where I felt like I was reading a captains type log of the Saturday ride. This was not developed at all. I felt a lot of the characters to be one dimensional. Also, that abrupt cliff hanger. What the H E double hockey sticks is that?! I'm a girl who doesn't like appetizers (they are just teasers). I like the full heaping plate. I seriously don't know why I kept reading. I guess I was just hoping that I could've been proved wrong, but I was right from the get go. So, bye Felicia.
1,Not much substance here ...
1,I think I got to chapter 5 before returning it to the library.  Delores taking something from the victims apartment, Lisa telling the story and making more cookies as The Cookie Jar gets a nice boom in business because of Lisas storytelling, and finally Hannah.  Hannah is absurd.  How can an adult who runs her own business be so unbelievably naive about so many things?  Technology has her completely baffled.  My dad, who is 74, knows how to use a DVR, iPhone, and an iPad.  She apparently knows nothing about her husband and doesnt think its appropriate to ask him questions about ANYTHING.  When the series started, Hannah seemed more mature, intelligent, and even likable.  Now, shes just a self-involved twit.  I took a break for a bit and read other cozy mysteries and started re-reading the Sue Grafton books and J.A. Jances J.P. Beaumont series.  Now, reading a Hannah Swensen book is like going back to a Dick and Jane book from elementary school.  In a recipe, there are instructions to take a fork from a drawer.  Really!?  If I could have given zero stars, I would have. If you want to read a series about characters who are somewhat believable and likable, skip Hannah Swensen.
1,Overhyped book. Story and writing too simplistic.
1,Christmas gift
1,Way too much backstory missing making this book hard to follow.  Not much substance to the story. Big on fluff not much detail. Would not recommend unless you've already read the series leading up to it.
1,The writing is terrible and the characters are instantly dislikable.  I made it two chapters before dumping it for something else.
1,OK, I'm only 20 pages in and what the heck do I know, but if you are a fan, you need to get your hands on this book.		Yeah, I should have read further.		I finally finished it.  Keep in mind I was a "fan".  I got "The One Tree" in March of 82 and I read it cover to cover in one sitting so my college roomates could get the book and not spoil it for me.  I wanted to name my son "Mhorham", thank god for my wife.  My wedding ring is white gold, just in case.		OK, I am 28 years older but jeez, is this thing boring, confusing and dull!		I can't keep the characters straight, but then again, i don't care about a single one.		I like the comparisons to Rowling, but it goes deeper than characters who must not be named.  Rowling and Donaldsons first books began with joy and love.  i remember laughing my tail off over a package covered by postage.  By the last book it was like reading a checklist of actions.  This guy dies, this guy does not.  dumbledore explains it to Harry, he wins, prologue.		Donaldson is doing the same thing.  the land is all used up, who cares if it dies now?		I know I'll buy the last one and slog through it, but if you read this Steve, try to bring some joy into the last book.		One little factoid to back up my review, and correct me if I am wrong, but at no time in this book does a single giant laugh.  If a ginat cannot take "joy in the ears that hear", how can I???????
1,My expectations were to high in reading this book. Caroline at times seemed to be a little spoiled and a bit of an airhead when it came to matters of safety and reality. Her and Brian seemed to be enamoured with each other but, to me, more so him than her. She was almost too needy and I think Brian could have personally been better off with the best friend. Caroline was suppose to have this stalker but halfway though the book, I was still waiting for the stalker to get his "stalk on"! Not very well developed with characters and secondary characters. Book should have been over a 100 pages before the ending. AT LAST, it was.		If you're looking for a book to pass the time on an airplane or to help you sleep, this is a good read.
1,Although I, personally, would have greatly enjoyed the book, IF it had not had such crude comments throughout. I realize it was written by a rough and tough military guy, but I asked my daughter to give this to me as part of my birthday present. I had seen it 'touted' on the 700 Club-so I naturally thought it would be a very clean, Christian book.	I admire the perseverance of Travis Mills and his wife and strongly support their efforts, and I pray that their ministry to help other wounded soldiers and families will succeed beyond their wildest dreams.	I just WISH the book had not had these off color comments. It was completely unnecessary to explain any given situation.....we can all get the picture without vulgar explanations. I have been wondering what would his little daughter would  feel about the way he expressed certain parts of the book. Once something is in print-it can never be recalled! I had to quit reading it before I finished-sad to say.
1,I hate to be a nay-sayer, but a nice writing style does not alone make a good book. While this story started out intriguing, it quickly deteriorated into nothing special. I agree we should be finding new young authors, but not at the expense of readers who spend hard-earned money for books. This one just does not have what it takes to make a great book. The writing is ethereal at times, but that quickly fades into pedantic and over-wrought descriptions that repeat themselves. The characters are bland, and given the circumstances should not be. We just DON'T CARE about them. and I often had the feeling I had read this before, or seen in a movie. Sorry, but once again over-hype yields junk. Trust me...save your money. There is talent here waiting to come out, but this high school level book is not the one.
1,Don't start the series, at least one book is already out-of-print.  Why would the publisher select books in the middle of a series to just available as an ebook?
1,Good goes into the Amazon to a primitive people to measure their food intake and how they acquire it - hunting and gardening. He manages to piss off three different universities that participate in funding his research and then whines that he is broke. He complains about the rules that Venezuela has for access to these primitive people.	If you can get past the self-aggrandizement and the whining, you will be appalled at the notion of him accepting the promise of a native 9 year old wife. He eventually impregnates her and moves her to New Jersey where she has no idea of what's going on. The notion that he would go to work when she has a baby or that he would obey a policeman is completely foreign to her experience. She hasn't been taught English. They eventually have more kids and the sad ending is that she goes back to the jungle and he keeps the kids in New Jersey. Talk about unprofessional!
1,This autobiography by serial killer Pee Wee Gaskins is brought to you by the apparently easily-duped co-author, journalist Wilton Earle. Gaskins' justifications and distortions are passed along with little examination or challenge, and probably bear small resemblance to the facts.
1,Years ago, I was such a diehard Grisham fan that many books after I stopped liking his stories, I'm still reading them! I just keep thinking he's going through a slump, but book after book now, he's let me down, and this one follows suit. The two main problems I have: cardboard, cliched characters that I've seen a thousand time (including in Grisham's previous book, but with different character names); and sudden endings that render the story moot. I won't get into the plot, which reviewers have already discussed, or spill any spoilers, but I can say that generally in a Grisham novel, like this one, the endings don't involve clever twists or the fruition of the protagonists' hard work. They just end. Someone says, "OK, I confess," or "Never mind, I'll do it your way," and it's over. Doesn't matter what kind of drama or dilemma came before, it all gets resolved. I'm being a bit oversimplistic here and am generalizing (not ALL his books do this, but enough that I characterize his stories this way). Really, there are better stories and better writers out there who need my money more and whose stories entertain me more. As much as I liked Grisham's early work, it feels blasphemous to say that, but there it is.
1,Poorly written, anachronistic and oddly unemotional considering the subject matter. This felt like a first draft that was never fleshed out. I expected more.
1,I was really disappointed in this book, way too long and why are the two main women of the story, supposedly Amazon-like, getting weak in the knees over men? I think the story idea was wonderful, but didn't at all live up to its promise. The modern day 'heroine' is just a ditz, (almost always in need of rescue) and the historical heroine throws her 'sisterhood' over for a man and leaves her freedom behind to live confined in a room in the palace at Troy. The author occasionally inserts an 'amazon/feminist' character who explains how all men are untrustworthy brutes and will always ruin a woman's life and how male children are always to be given up, apparently in her quest to affirm that she really does understand feminist philosophy and really is a feminist and these characters should lend her story credibility and appeal to her feminist readers. In addition, I do not understand why the author took recognizable characters from Greek myth and changed them. Really a mess of a book, at almost 600 pages, don't waste your time, too many really good women's reads available. Mist of Avalon maybe?
1,How can I love Turner & Naomi and all of their grit but hate Ronnie & Lola? They are all rock stars & God knows I never like stories about rock gods who can't seem to leave their hands off of all the free groupie love that is thrown their way. Ronnie has always been the sad depressed drummer after losing the love of his life. Now he is a drug addict with tons of babies across the country. He is a walking STD! Lola is a drummer for another band on their tour & she is being blackmailed. But this is very dark stuff when Ronnie's baby mamas are in serious danger. Lola is Australian but she is just as dark & depressed as Ronnie. They have strong sexual chemistry but it is as dark & dirty as they are as a couple. The whole blackmail thing, Ronnie's babies that Ronnie has just started thinking about having some kind of connection with, their dirty love affair - it all is very confusing and not interesting one bit. Unfortunately I already bought the next book so I'm stuck. Hoping it is about Turner & Naomi because I am interested in their lives.
1,WARNING!!  I bought this box set on the assumption that the complete story would be told because HBO will air an original series based on these four books. After reading all four books averaging over one thousand pages EACH... you read a big "TO BE CONTINUED" after days of reading. He wrote the "to be continued" on the last page of book four dated 2005 [6 YEARS AGO]!!! He didn't even have the foresight or simple courtesy to settle even one of the many subplots. By the time the final books will be available, it will be a rare person who will remember enough to truly enjoy the final books.  That is unacceptable. I can't judge the series until I've read them all therefore he gets one star for this waste of time and I might upgrade it in twelve years. Good writer - very bad person.
1,Pretty good
1,I was late getting to the party. I had been reading rave reviews about the writings of Edward St. Aubyn including the over-used descriptor a writers writer. His Patrick Melrose novels gained praise like one of the most amazing reading experiences Ive had in a decade from Michel Chabon, the wit of Wilde, the lightness of Wodehouse, and the waspiness of Waugh from Zadie Smith, and on every page of St. Aubyns work is a sentence or a paragraph that prompts a laugh, or a moment of enriched comprehension from James Wood. So when I came across a newer novel entitled Lost for Words, I thought now is the time for me to join the fans of St. Aubyn.		 Lost for Words was a poor choice to start exploring his writing. I found the novel mildly entertaining but essentially dull, the plot contrived, the dialogue forced, and the characters underdeveloped. There were some laugh-out-loud moments but they were few and far between. Perhaps I had picked it up with too high expectations. Perhaps its not representative of his other works that so many people adore. Perhaps Ill give him another chance. But not likely soon.
1,Glaring typos all over this book. I got this through Kindle Unlimited, so it was free. After encountering major typos numerous times, I just stopped reading it.		Attached is an example.
1,I had to force myself to finish this book and when I did I wondered why I had.  Has not found her speed yet.
1,Good start; predictable finish. Gratuitous sex; heroic battles - almost Ulyssus-like. Sgt Troy is another in a seemingly endless line of 'outliers' working a job with little recognition and less pay yet they plodding on with huge leaps of intuition because they are the best and ttey know it.  Troy survives attacks, bombings double-dealing and a host of sinewy characters that are almost trite in their mannerisms...charachterizatins of their own characters. Too bad; the book started off with so much promise and ends with an impossible John Wayne stand-off. But that is, I fear, what we have come to expect with our "lone-wolf, against the establishment, cult-like anti-heroes. Making them more human doesn't necesarily mean beddign the mysteriuos beuty or solving Rubic-likes plots with Holmes-like intuition.
1,So so
1,Ok
1,I loved his memoir. This book was disappointing. I couldn't get into the storyline although I really tried. It seemed flat somehow and manufactured. I gave it 50 pages or so then gave up.
1,Very short read, which was fine, but this story  was VERY dull to me. I don't have anything more to say
1,Worst Kindle experience ever-this is a good story totally ruined by typos on nearly every page. Needs to be fixed.  Just a few of the hundreds:		"Ella was dead for live years"  "the second-Boor bedroom" "Ella's Huns-band was ill" "the rumble of the ourgan sent shivers trough"  - on and on throughout the Kindle version.
1,I had high hopes for this book after trying to read the Microsoft Step by Step book, but am very disappointed about the quality of the book.  To me, it was poorly organized and written.  My eyes glaze over when trying to read this book.  I'm hoping the SAM's book will be better than this one.  I won't buy from this author again.
1,until this I like Paulson; the title "Barely Alive" describes the book completely!
1,Our Women's Sunday School class is about to finish this up.  At our last class, many of us opened up that we will be glad to finish this book.  I'll only speak from my view at this point but it was a struggle to get through.  Too wordy, repeating same concepts and written at a level that you feel like you are working on a college dissertation.  Could have been written in half the amount.  We were left questioning more about what she was trying to say than the few moments where there were some great passages.  Not to mention several mistakes.  We couldn't believe an editor let some things pass.  References to finding things in bible that the study bible and online searching couldn't find referenced in bible.  Plus very very technical with the real vineyard, but we were spending time trying to follow the running a vineyard versus more time with the tons of examples she through out there to try and make her point.  Plus pictures thrown in that we were trying to figure out who they were or the correlation.  Sorry but not a book many of us at least will be recommending.  Cindy probably used the writing to help her personal struggles which is great, but not something easy to follow for someone else to read that hasn't been with her in her struggles.  This is the first not very positive review I've done on a book, but I didn't want another group to pick it up and bear through the many weeks to get through this.  The only reason I didn't give it a one star is because there were 3 to 4 instances in the book where a passage did speak to me.
1,I was so excited to read this book. I read Divergent and Insurgent, but this book just took away all my joy. Seriously? How can you kill off your main character? Was it needed?  First of all, Tris dies. Like what? I understood why you did that, for the love of her brother and for the forgiveness of him. Also, because in Divergent and Insurgent Tris always risks near death experiences and you believe that you should close off the novel with Tris actually dying. Seriously? I put my all into this book and  wasted my money and my time reading it. For example, you should have added a twist where Tris sacrifices herself to save her brother and then Upon reaching the weapons lab and held at gunpoint bu David Caleb, the coward he is, should have saved Tris life. He should have come up and taken the bullet for his sister. Let him sacrifice an  redeem himself. Anyways you can end the book any way you want I don't have a say just to think about your readers and your career before you think to write or if you ever write again.	Also, I would like to point out that in the Hunger Games- I don't want to compare because there are both two different books but I have to to show an example- Suzanne Collins did not kill off he  Main character, which is a stupid act, she killed the sister of the main character and  described it well. She is a very great author and that is what you expect from one not one that kills the main character that the whole trilogy is based on. How can you expect a movie to be made from this? It will not get any views for it will be stupid	This book is alright I really do love the lovescenes between Tris and  Tobias and I enjoyed Tobias perspective of things throughout the book. I always wanted to know what Tobias was thinking.	Really great book, a little too lazy in some parts but need to fix the ending
1,Academic, complicated, and I wondered what it was all about while reading it. I am not an amateur reader	but felt like it with this book.
1,I enjoyed the first two books in this series. The others not so much. This	book was just meh. It was kinda dumb at times. This series has really	run it course.
1,I wish Varley had written a science-fiction novel instead of a disaster novel. That novel would have been about the development of the virus, about other people trying to stop it or cure it. It would at least have been about something. Instead we get a routine disaster novel that's special only in its lack of zombies. It's readable enough (and unlike other reviewers I didn't mind the LA details) except that there's a faint whiff of misogyny and putting women back in their place about the whole thing. Even more so there's that old Y2K sense of "maybe it's OK that everything will be broken because then we'll live in a better way". There seems to be something weird that happens to some old white male science fiction writers that makes them start going off political deep ends.		In the light of the Newton massacre, I'm also starting to think that there are too many nuts out there who take these stories seriously and are arming themselves against a disaster which will never come and ignoring the disaster that their arms are generating.
1,This was a good book, it was kind of slow reading at times. I did like that it was a true story.
1,Or as I called it- Tax Write Off Vacation Time For The Elkins Family.	Honestly, this guy won an Edgar? I read it based on that alone and honestly, this book managed to be one dimensional and oddly offensive at the same time. I guess that's not easy. I had hopes for it because I do love a good Brit mystery and learning more about the War was a bonus but this was written like a primer for how not to write a mystery- 1) Broadcast the plot twist in the prologue. 2) Make the main character a boring know-it-all. 3) Vaguely offend several minorities with a character's "candor". 4) Be boring. It's really the last one that kills it for me.		But if you have ever wanted to spend endless meals with boring cardboard cutouts that will remind you of being trapped on a moon light river cruise dinner with loud talkers and the photo album of their granddaughter's wedding, be my guest. Please, and pass on my regrets.
1,Got the book, and it's obviously some photocopied essays someone compiled into a book that is made to order. There isn't any citation information, unfortunately, so I can't use it for academic writing and publishing information like I had planned to. I'll keep it for personal use, but it was an unfortunate waste of money for what I needed it for. Just be aware of all that if you, like me, need it for academic writing or writing that requires a bibliography or other similar citation, this book is out of the question. Also, the book has the tiniest print I've ever seen. If whoever is making these is just printing them off of their computer, it'd be nice if they could make the print a tad bit bigger.
1,I've bought many Halcyon Kindle editions with classic SF, but this one I had to return for a refund. (Just contact Kindle Help and give them the order number and request a refund.) The table of contents hyperlinks were faulty and so I couldn't find the novels!!! I know how hard and tricky it can be to get this right but really, Halcyon, you owe it to your readers to allow them to find the stories they've bought.
1,I did not like this book at all.  This book was not what I expected from Janet Evanovich.  I like her romantic comedy/mystery style based on the real world.
1,Why would such a good author choose to re-write such an old, over-done story that has so much similarity to The Thing. That's all that this is.	But the second and third movies of The Thing were better than this.		I hope next time he tries to come up with an ORIGINAL story to tell.
1,Not my kind of entertainment.  Depressing at every turn.  Things are bad.  Things get worse.  Everybody dies -- horribly.  That's the story in a nut shell if you want to skip the rapes, the torture, the blood and guts, the totally hopeless, going nowhere action.  Ugh.
1,It didn't really grab me. I thought it dragged and I probably won't read any more of these. Kinda boring.
1,I'm not sure why others rated it so highly. I really didn't like anything about the book, the cops were morons, the main characters weren't interesting or likeable and the ending was like wha?
1,This is a intriguing read, the subject jumps back and forth in time making for a confusing story.	The story Does keep you reading.
1,I generally love Rachel Gibson. So imagine my surprise as a pick up Any Man of Mine and think "have I read this before...it feels so familiar?" It doesn't take me long to decide that I have read a much better version of this story and it was written by Rachel Gibson herself a dozen years ago or so. Anyone who has read Simply Irresistible (which I loved!) already knows exactly what's going to happen in Any Man of Mine.		***SPOILER***	Both heros are hockey players. Both heros lose close loved ones and allow guilt and depression to turn them into self destructive jerks.  The heroines both plan or cater weddings. Both couples meet for quickie flings and conceive children. Both heroines spend a few years as nuns/single moms before dad joins the parenting party. Fast forward through a few more weddings, two cloned beach house vacations, and two crazily similar Hawaiian epilogues and everything is wrapped up in a tidy HEA bow. Can an author plagarize her own work? Did Rachel Gibson just take the manuscript for Simply Irresistible, add new names, change the backstory, and call it a day? What a disappointment!		***END SPOILER***		Another problem with this story is the plot structure. There is entirely too much time devoted to the backstory. We already know by pg. 50 that the hero and heroine met in Vegas, got drunk, got married, got pregnant, and got divorced. We got it. Spending another 100-150 pages on flashbacks, reflections, and backstory only takes away from the development of the "current" relationship. In the end the author just didn't spend enough pages showing how the hero and heroine really fall in love. I just didn't buy it. The hero spent years emotionally distancing himself from his son, then all of a sudden begins to demand the heroine commit to him RIGHT NOW! He's either got a colossal set of cojones or he's a spoiled brat. Given that the only justification we ever really get for the hero and heroine's relationship is sexual chemistry - it must be massive cojones! Either way, at various times during the novel when the hero gets angry with the heroine and begins to avoid her, I just thought, "GOOD...you both will be better off if you trade off child care through the personal assistant and fall in love with someone new." I actually found myself rooting for the heroine to totally dump the hero. Now that's a first for me!		If you haven't read Simply Irresistible buy it instead of Any Man of Mine. This story was so much better the first time!
1,I thought that there were too many technical words and the whole story was very repetative. I almost stopped reading it. Sorry
1,Okay, I am probably the only person on the planet who is going to get lambasted for hating The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. I don't know if people read these with a preconceived notion that for their time these books were ahead of their time and convince themselves that they are great, or if they genuinely like them. However, I don't really see any difference in the writing style or the storyline than many other fantasy books that are geared toward gradeschool, and they fall well short of modern Fantasy writers, so there's no comparison there. And after The Hobbit, I tried to start The Lord of the Rings series and couldn't get through the first book.		The story dragged, the characters were great, but didn't do anything new and different from what I have already read, and for some reason I just don't have a soft spot for these to give them kudos for historical value. Frankly I felt that the whole purpose of the story lacked depth.		I even tried to watch the movies and couldn't make it through a single one.		I like Tolkien and have enjoyed learning about his life, but as far as his writing goes, I am not impressed.
1,predictable terrible writing.  Poorly researched.
1,This book was slow and hard to follow.  I love this author's Alex Delaware series, but this was terrible.  The only excitement in the book was the last 20 minutes of reading.  It goes back over so much history and so many situations from the past that it's hard to keep track of what happened.  If you're a die hard fan, go ahead and read it, others may like it more than I did.  I don't recommend it for newcomers to the series.
1,Not what I expected at all.  seemed to be a disjointed story.  Must have to be a fan of Dicks to understand his writings.
1,boring
1,This fourth book became bogged down and the end was just a complete left turn.		-The main character didn't ever really do anything surprising, clever, or innovative	-Everything was so complex and on a ridiculous scale that things just lost meaning (think late game on a civ builder)	-The author tried to get cute and tricky on several plot elements, it just made things more convoluted and awkward	-The ending sucked and was a jarring departure to the overall story, a watered down matrix ripoff in my opinion	-The Truth Seeker elements were pretty absurd by the end. Paragraphs where "I think at you" that did zero to bring a sense of action and suspense for the reader. It was like children playing cowboys and indians yelling "bam I got you, you're dead".	-Too many characters to keep track of. So many nobles with long names. No time to really flesh out any of them before you're meeting yet another gaggle.	-Overly simple solutions that happen off the page and are just declared to the reader. "Oh yeah, I just negotiated a treaty so that whole main plot element we've been working on for hundreds of pages is just over." or "Well crud I'm about to lose, let me just hand over my entire empire to you since you're so gloriously awesome."		Given the decline of the third book and the disaster of the fourth, I'm abandoning the series.
1,"Rescue Me" is the latest by Rachel Gibson; it's a (very loose) follow-up to "Any Man of Mine" which was, in turn, a very loose follow-up to "Nothing But Trouble".		I've read the other two books in the linked series and, unfortunately, I found this book to be the weakest of all of them.		The plot is fairly standard in this book. Vince is a former Navy SEAL and, for a variety of reasons, he ends up in a small town (Lovett, Texas which is also the setting of one of Gibson's most successful books - "Daisy's Back in Town") and decides to stick around to purchase and renovate his aunt's convenience store. Around the same time (same day, actually) Sadie comes back to Lovett to attend her cousin's wedding. They have a meet-cute on the side of the road when Sadie gives Vince a ride to the nearest gas station. And the rest of the book goes downhill from there.		The primary reason I didn't enjoy the book was because Vince was not a well written character. It's not just that he's not a likable character (and he's not). It's that he is not well written. Gibson frequently spends paragraphs and paragraphs on what's going on in Vince's head and there's not much there. It's just very repetitive passages on Vince's memories of being a Navy SEAL and how that makes him incredibly macho. Since it's a romance novel, the author also has to be very clear that Vince is not going to be deployed any time soon (because what kind of HEA would it be for the heroine if the hero is going to be shipped out to Afghanistan two days after they hook up?), so there is the requisite back-story of a siege gone wrong, a best friend who died, and a medical discharge that took away sixty percent of the hero's hearing in one ear.		I got the sense that Gibson's editors must have been ecstatic when the bin Laden raid happened and it was revealed that the SEALs were responsible for it. There must have been conversations between her and Avon where they said, "Look, this is awesome. SEALs are hot right now and you've got this book in the pipeline. Amp that up. Amp that SEALs stuff WAY up." There are comments made about bin Laden, of course. And Vince spends a great deal of time letting everyone know that the SEALs are the best.		Well that may be true, but if Vince is a primary example of what they're like, then they are also arrogant SOBs. Vince spends most of the book thinking mean thoughts about people and has major commitment issues (which seemed standard romance hero issue and weren't really "cured" properly by the end of the book). He wants to have sex with the heroine but doesn't think it's at all possible to settle down and have a LIFE at some point. He appears to be in his mid-thirties so that particular personality trait makes him seem like an idiot. Especially since he's spent a great deal of time helping his sister raise her child. It makes no sense that he wouldn't - at some point - be able to look at his nephew and realize that he wants that for himself. He has no emotional growth and so I can't buy into the HEA. How can he go from being that much of an emotional robot to "I love you so much" after hanging out with the heroine for a couple of months? It's true that Sadie seems like an interesting person, but she's not THAT awesome. In fact, she seems like a rather generic person to me - she has very little interests and no hobbies or talents (other than being a good real estate agent, I think? She also loves reality TV, which seems shoe-horned in to make her seem interesting, but does little to make her so.).		On Sadie's part, she's dealing with her own daddy issues and that doesn't seem to be resolved all that well, either. I didn't buy into a lot of the decisions Sadie makes at the end of the book. For that reason, I felt that we didn't get to know Sadie and what made her tick. (I won't get into the details of how we had a very rushed understanding of how she's spent her life and she seemed to be a loner with absolutely no friends or life to speak of.)		This is the rare romance novel where I felt the romance actually DETRACTED from the story. Every time we made progress with Sadie and Vince (more so Sadie than Vince), I felt we had to press pause to let the two characters have a requisite sex scene. It was rather frustrating reading.		Rachel Gibson is a hit-or-miss author for me. This one was definitely a miss.
1,Freeman's Mastering Black and White Digital Photography provides brief but adequate coverage of color to grayscale conversion as well as manipulation of the resulting grayscale image (eg preserving shadow and highlight detail, adjusting curves). It assumes Photoshop, so techniques such as channel mixing may not be relevant if you use another program. It is VERY poorly edited: text and figures sometimes don't match, many figures are so small that the modifications being illustrated are difficult or impossible to see, some figures are printed across the gutter, etc. I recommend looking at this book before purchasing it to see if it provides you with enough value for the money.
1,It seems like an English major wrote this as her class thesis because she has all these quotes from Shakespeare plays in her head, and wants to share them with us.  Takes a stab at memory and  memory loss.
1,didn't like it was hard to get into
1,This novel centers around Chicago Public Defender, Kristen Mayhew. An obsessed vigilante is murdering criminals that she has failed to convict, and then sending her letters of admiration. Dectective Abe Reagan of the Chicago Police Department is sent to protect her, as it is feared Kristen could become a target of the vigilante, or other criminals.		I found this story a bit of a disappointment. Having read a number of Karen Rose novels, I am starting to see a 'sameness' about them, which I don't like. I found myself cringing at times, at the dialogue between the two main characters, who wereunconvincing. The story was a bit more slow moving, also, in comparison to other Karen Rose novels that I have read. Not one of her best.
1,Apparently the printer of this book needs to be a little more generous with the ink.  Lot of the text is so faded,... I mean, come on, this is English people trying to learn a new language, so, missing or faded letters is not cool.
1,Very disappointing follow up to a great first book in this series. Above all else the story is beyond unrealistic when it comes to the main story of Evan's incarceration.	The storytelling necomes slow and and clumsy. Evan becomes unsympathetic and the book only gets going in a few parts.	This is a great pity as I loved the first book, and I'm not sure I'm going to bother with the next.
1,Megan Frampton, you know nothing about the world in which the rest of us reside. Let me guess. You are between 11 and 15. You've yet to start school. Your knowledge is so one dimensional as to make this book positively illogical and...worryingly off the sanity chart. May I suggest you take your developing talent, cut your story down by 90% and then read what you've written to your school Gymnastics teacher (aloud) and ask for a review!!
1,I am only halfway through the book and I have found a very simple mistake. They list 16+36=50 when they are showing an example of Pythagorean Theorem. So not too sure how much to trust this book anymore....
1,One of the most maddening books I have ever read! If you enjoy characters making inexplicably idiotic decision, gaping plot holes and logical inconsistencies, then this book is for you! What's worse is this could have been a very fun read; the bad guy is uniquely despicable and the backdrop of secret societies and European history is very rich. However promising these aspects are, all goodwill is lost when the author has his protagonists behave in ways that make no sense whatsoever. Argh!
1,As another former Peace Corps volunteer who served in Honduras, I eagerly read Ms. Joe's book. Although Honduras ranks among the top three Peace Corps destinations during the last half century, this is only the third volunteer memoir to be published. I was quickly disappointed by a romantic introduction about a childhood trip to Honduras and dismayed by a long sentimental description of her life long before the Peace Corps, details that have nothing to do with her service.		Worse yet, Ms. Joe incorrectly describes Honduran history. When I contacted her by e-mail and asked, she reported that she used her Peace Corps training notes. She never even bothered to go to a library and fact-check. Likewise, I found it discouraging that she disparaged neighbors for silly things like an old man who flirted with her. Hey! At her age she should have at least received the flor this man threw her way with a bit of good will.		She claims to be a Spanish translator yet in her book she tells us nothing about the Honduran culture. Here's what another reviewer said, "I usually love Peace Corps memoirs, but this one falls flat. The author gives a thorough catalog of her time in the Peace Corps in Honduras, but it's just events and places with zero emotion or reaction or marveling at cultural differences."  In the book, the author repeats the phrase, "Fast forward to" as if this were a film. What part would she imagine for herself? The same woman who never bothered to learn their history and who hates their macho customs paints herself as a modern day Florence Nightengale.		Finally, the author never even mentions historical progress in Honduras. Three years before the Peace Corps arrived, infant mortality was 13%, the average life expectancy 44.5 years, literacy 50% and the average number of completed school years for the literate was less than 3. By 2010, infant mortality had dropped to 3%, life expectancy increased to 69.4 years, 83% of the population was literate and the average number of school years completed had increased to 6.5. As with Honduran history, possibly the author was just too lazy and self-centered to even check. Maybe it would have gotten in the way of her story about how she saved Hondurans despite themselves.		This is a good example of an author who never learned the difference between an autobiography and a memoir, between a film and a book. Her service to the nation and the world is commendable. Her effort to describe this service is laudable. However, the acts of writing and publishing a book do not guarantee universal acclaim. Any aspiring writer should learn their craft and also search for credible editing.		Of the nearly four dozen Peace Corps memoirs I have read, this is the worst, not because Ms. Joe cannot write a sentence and spell. She can. But she never reflects upon her words nor did she ever really experience Honduras other than as some sort of stage to play out her own fantasies as if she considered herself the program incarnate. Take a look at the book's cover design. There are nine photos and one third of them are of the author. Inside, the reader is treated to many more. If you are interested in Honduras or the Peace Corps, find another book. Don't waste money on this one.

1,I agree with what the others have said. I checked out the audio version from my library and aside from what is in the book (or lack thereof) the readers voice sounds like someone i'd want to punch in the face.
1,surprisingly undeveloped.
1,Good writing style but too predictable with typical cliches. No surprises or twists. Basically felt like I been there, done that.
1,Cannot understand why so many rate this book 5 stars.  I think I have read most all of this author's books, and enjoyed them, so I did not even try a sample on this one, just purchased it.  Must say that I did not care for it at all. Forced myself to finish it .  The repetitive "if only, if only" was so annoying, as were the characters.  Lin D.
1,I didn't finish it.  It in not my kind of story.
1,Here's another "find gold in the desert" book that's just old and outdated. There is virtually nothing of use in here so I wouldn't waste your time or money on it as you can easily google anything this book will tell you.
1,I kept waiting for this mindless piece of fiction to redeem itself and persevered to the bitter end.  Alas, no redemption was to be had.
1,a
1,I have enjoyed reading this book I am looking forward to reading more of nora roberts  books on my kindle I can just pick it up, more then I have ever picked my books up
1,Not much here and lots of British-isms, at least for me.
1,I originally was going to put 1 star.....but I don't really HATE it, I just think it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know.  Overpriced, over-rated, and most of all, the stupid book has been bound so strongly, you can't keep it comfortably open while trying to read it.
1,Absurd, offensive, imagination gone wild.  Written in very poor taste and offensive to many Christians.  Did not like it at all.
1,When I realized it was not a book for advanced readers, I gave it away. Harlequin Publisher, gave me a start, I don't read shallow novels. Low level reading.  I had ordered it for a book club read.
1,"The Shores of Tripoli" has a excellent premise: following a young officer in the infant US Navy in its war with the Barbary pirates early in the 19th century. The story brings together many fascinating historical persons, from naval heroes Stephen Decatur and Oliver Hazard Perry, to colorful rulers of the Barbary states, to the rulers of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. However, I'm sorry to say, the execution of the story is amateurish at best.		What do I mean by amateurish? To begin, the author tells rather than shows. For example, at one point the hero has to transport to Italy a young woman whom he has rescued from an Algerian harem. During the voyage, she refuses to remain in her cabin, but insists on dressing in sailor's clothes and helping to work the ship. But does the author describe this as it happens? No. Instead, we learn of all this when the hero tells his commanding officer about it, after the fact. One can only imagine what an O'Brian or a Forster could have done with that situation! Another aspect of amateurism is the use of anachronistic language. For example, the Barbary pirates are always spoken of as enslaving "white Christians" - when, in point of fact, the people fo the period would have just said "Christians", as the pirates were equal-opportunity slavers. Yet another aspect of amateurism is technical inaccuracy; for example, the author continually speaks of "rifles", when the sailors and marines of the time would have carried smooth-bore muskets.		The language is leaden, without richness or cadence. The ever-changing sea is never described. The narrative is devoid of humor. The Ottoman soldiers are minstrel-show caricatures. None of the sailors the hero commands, or any of his fellow officers, is described, or even named. Apart from a burst of sailor-talk when the hero is being examined for the rank of lieutenant, none of the details of sailing, or fighting, or farming, or anything-else-ing is ever described. I must admit that there is one passage that does go into detail: when, near the end of the book, the author describes an encounter between the hero and a young woman - but it brings new meaning to the phrase "too much information".		I bought this book thanks to the review in the Wall Street Journal that described "The Shores of Tripoli" as an American successor to the Aubrey-Maturin novels. I'm sorry to say, it's nothing of the sort. Mr Haley may be a fine historian (I've not read any of this other books), but, alas, he's no novelist. Sad, because in the right hands this could have been a terrific story.
1,I started this book eagerly but I have to admit that I put it aside after reading about 25% of it. I am a reader of nonfiction and was looking forward to reading a stirring account of the hurricane. What I found, unfortunately, was a book that read like a fifth grade social studies text. Short little snippets of information and characters choppily tossed together. I will likely return to the book if only to learn more about the disaster but I doubt that it will be a pleasurable reading experience.
1,These images are grotesque and scary. What is seen can not be unseen.  I can't believe the picture book images are suggested for preschoolers through 3rd grade.		You people who think this book is visually great really need to grow up.  Children might say its cool only because you're telling them how great it is.  The pictures are awful and disturbing.  Really. Stop lying to yourself.  Creepy things are for teenagers.
1,As hard as I tried, I could not fall into the rhythm of this book. It lacked dialogue and was riddled with entirely too much narrative. I think the storyline could have been a lot stronger, if the author had engaged the other characters in the book, instead of everything being a summary of the main character's thoughts. I came to the conclusion that the main character was so anti-social as to not want to include the others in the conversation. I guess, you could say that the title is apropos.
1,I have read only 1 other book by Ms. Shreve. And I am disappointed with this one in comparison to the other.		I liked the setting - Africa - in the 1970s (I believe). It was interesting to read about the dynamics between the local tribes and the British/American residents.		Margaret, follows her husband, Patrick, to Africa from New England. Patrick is a doctor studying disease. Margaret is a photographer.  Early on in the story, Margaret and Patrick join a British couple on a climb of Mt. Kenya. The climb ends in disaster and since this event, Margaret and Patrick lose ground on their marriage. The story continues with Patrick and Margaret's strife.  At one point, they think their marriage is better and then it is not.		Overall, I had absolutely no compassion nor feeling toward Margaret. I found her to be quite annoying. She constantly dwells on the tragedy and lets it affect her marriage to Patrick. Instead of trying to resolve the conflicts, they both just plod along hoping things to get better. Patrick, to me, was awful! A quite 2-dimensional character seeming to have been inserted into the story to only add grief and irritation to Margaret. The marriage was also lacking substance. The ending? HORRIBLE! I couldn't believe that we would go through all that trouble to read the story only to be left with an ending that didn't resolve anything and seemed too abrupt. (I don't want to give any spoilers).
1,I am learning Hindi, and I threw this book to the recycle bin in less than a week. If you are just going for a trip to India and want to say few sentences you could do with it, but it is definitely not a book for Hindi students.
1,I looked forward to this book and had it on my wish list at my local library.  The story started off well enough, however it completely lost my respect once the main character (Patsy) gets out of prison.  Huneven did a great job painting picture of an alcoholic with little in the way of decency and even less awareness of her actions on others.  What confused me, and had me going back to check I was reading the same book, was the way the novel opened, with another character (Joey) seemingly the protagonist.		Once Patsy leaves prison, and sensibly sets out to live a quiet good life, the growth she had in prison stops.  She very clearly decides to do little to learn anything from her past.  Her first "relationship" (Ian) is about as toxic as it can get, which makes no sense for a character who had been immersed in AA.  Ian has no redemptive qualities at all and I sat reading with disgust and loathing that any woman would date such a man, let alone one in recovery.  Once she decides to cast him off she consciously decides to pursue and marry someone she doesn't even really respect, all so she can lay claim to making an adult decision.		With all that mess happening, I kept wondering why the novel started off with it's focus on Joey and then just focused on another.  When Joey finally does reappear it's with a ludicrous twist.  Seeing as how Patsy didn't learn squat from the heartache she caused (and really she was let off EASY with the prison sentence and the grieving father being so magnanimous) the twist just falls flat.  I never got the sense that she felt all that badly.		The one joy was the character Gilles, until the revelation in his journals that he was just a mean spirited twit.  The characters in this novel are just careless whiners.
1,Unfortunately Criterion has (again) cornered the market on a classic film and no other DVD of reasonable quality exists. This DVD, overpriced as all Criterion entries are, is a disappointment. The restoration is not particularly good, with fuzzy resolution and distortion around the edges in many scenes. The sound quality, too, is well below par for a premium-priced DVD. Compare this disk with the superb DVDs of "Sunset Boulevard" (Paramount) and "All About Eve" (20th Century Fox). On both of these disks, the picture and sound restoration, as well as the bonus features, far surpass Criterion's "Godfrey" at a far, far lower price.
1,junk	don't waste your time
1,I love this Bible ! It is just wonderful. But the kindle version needs a lot of work. I can't select a specific chapter, I have to start at chapter 1 of each book this makes it so hard to get around. Sentences freeze in a vertical fashion, very strange. Kindle please fix these problems!!! I love reading this Bible!!!
1,Saran Wrap, salt, etc. are too gimmicky in my opinion.  This is old stuff that has been done for years.  The art work is okay but not exceptional nor is there any drawing skill demonstrated.  To me her work is like finding forms in cloud formations.  Put an eye here or an ear there and you have a Lion or a mouse, whatever.  The same can be said of the flowers.  If you throw yellow on the paper you have to pull out a yellow flower then add a bit of orange to make a daffodil.  An what size are her paintings?  What do they look like framed?  The book lacks continuity.  I have never seen a book with three "Introductions".  For those people who need to learn how to paint loosely this book might help.  But I was pretty much disappointed.
1,Not so good
1,We may never know why Elizabeth George decided to dump Inspector Lynley, especially as she left us with a 'cliff-hanger' at the end of her last one (Living the Lie?). "Edge..." may have been written by her (I'm not quite sure), but it certainly doesn't hold up to the brilliant work she did in the Lynley series. Perhaps a bit bored with the whole success thing?
1,A paranormal steamy romance.	**given a copy in exchange for an honest review**
1,If typo's in books drive you insane...stay away from this book!  Cant even begin to say how many of them I ran into or words in the wrong place/context. The book was long, didn't draw me in and not very believable. How does someone who is brutally raped for years on end by someone she is supposed to trust believe that a BSMD relationship will in any way fix that?  I don't think so.
1,This book was very hard for me to follow. Very wordy and repetitious. I got the message of wrongful conviction but this was not a book I enjoyed reading at all
1,I wanted to like this book.  I'm a novice cyclist who enjoys using a bike for commutes, when permittable, and I also enjoy books that are funny and can intelligently rip into a culture.  However, "The Enlightened Cyclist" fails.  Instead of anything funny, smart, or even useful, this book is mainly just a writer trying to see how many gags he can yank out of groups of people.		A few pokes at cycling stereotypes?  Fine.  But the author goes overboard with that to the point I felt sorry for each and every group, and when that's done he has the audacity to declare religion false, as if that has anything to do with the point of this book.  Frankly, I'm left with the feeling that I should be considered stupid for being spiritual, interested in the environment, or even a bike owner.  There's a fine line between being funny and intelligently honest and just being plain mean.		The writing itself seems to depend on being snappy.  Yes, the author is a fine writer who can certainly turn a phrase, but his problem is that he ultimately has nothing to say.  Thirty pages in and I'm already sick of his complaints and advice and their heaping dose of "Look how funny I can be!"		The book was ultimately disappointing, and I'm pretty sure I got a headache from just trying to read it.  This might be ultimately for the cycling cult, but I found it a waste of time.
1,This is a tired old plot, the crazy but seemingly sane friend of the happy couple moves in on the husband and discredits the wife, while trying to send her over the edge.  Sigh, been there, read that, more times than I care to count.  Unfortunately, the characters fall flat, and the story moves too slow to even be remotely interesting.  A major disappointment for fans of the author's previous work "Just What Kind of Mother Are You?"		Skip it, and hope for the better next time around.
1,This book is very intense and perhaps should be used as a study guide for those majoring in Counseling in college.....it is hard to read and very intense.  But the book was in good condition and happy with business with seller.
1,I was looking forward to this book. I even bought the book, which I rarely do.	This was by far the worst in the series. The characters were dry and one dimensional. None of them	were endearing. The main character who owns a b and b snoops in her guest's rooms and even reads their email. This alone makes her unlikeable. Not very ethical.		The mystery itself was so dull.		I don't know what happened as the previous books in the series were all fun reads. This wasn't.	I recommend all of the books prior to this one for a cozy read but not this one.
1,A Superior Man recognized bullsh*t when he reads it.  This is it.  Good for a laugh if you want to read someone desperately trying to sound wise. "This way dissolves wide open."  Yeah, someone who picked up all their wisdom from episodes of Kung Fu. (That was a fantastic show, BTW.  When I was 10.)		It's actually got a few bits of decent advice but it's so buried in flowery crap that you probably won't notice.
1,Loved The Heretic's Daughter but this one didn't grab my interest at all.  Had not Heretic's Daughter been so good, I doubt it have gotten stars from Kirkus and PW.  The problem is that the author doesn't seem to know how to fill out her story.  She keeps dragging the reader back to England to fully flesh out what should only be a subplot -- and a contrived one at that.  Every time we get back to Massachusetts, she doesn't seem to know what to do with the story or the characters, so much so that vague plot references left me confused as to whether days, long months or even years had passed between chapters. The author wants to make sure we know life in the struggling colony is harsh, but the only way she seems to feel she can do this is including an almost obsessional amount of savagery directed toward animals.  Hence lambs are ripped and shredded  by wolves, wolves are shot through the throat and spew geysers of blood, dog fights are backdrops in the pointless and wooden ENglish scene, calves are slaughtered in detail.  The author seems much more in touch with these scenes than she does than she does with her characters.  The central story, a slow-building tale of unlikely love, seems forced and never quite believable. I was really hoping for better from this author.
1,I'm giving this two stars because it was a page turner. However, it lacked in every respect. Flimsy characters, MIA plot, substandard writing and there's no "there" there. You end this book with no additional insignts into the human condition, nothing learned, no thoughts provoked, just time wasted turning empty pages.		If you want to read hundreds of pages describing how handsome sparkly vampires are, this is the book for you. Otherwise, it makes a good doorstop.
1,This was just way too much wording for me.  There is a point where there are just too many descriptives.  I didn't make it through the first chapter... after rolling my eyes for the 10th time, I just put it down.
1,Failed to inspire me.
1,Is this book interesting? Well yes, this is an interesting topic, and the author covers lot's of ground, and obviously knows a great deal about the history of science; in particular physical science.	However, the first 200 pages killed the curiosity of this reader - I have a clear feeling it was more important to the author to impress me than to educate me. I do not need to have every scientist living between 1600 and 1900 mentioned (or know that the author knows about them) - I need just fifty pages background to develop the ideas we are to discuss later. After 200 pages I was totally exhausted and bored.
1,Here's the story: A young American couple, she a free-lance photographer, he a doctor, are living in Kenya in the 1970s. Their marriage seems to be suffering from sort of a general ennui. And they have troubles; their stuff keeps getting stolen by various criminals. They decide to embark on an adventure, a climb of Mount Kenya, accompanied ty two other couples. Someone dies. Feelings of guilt, blame, and jealousy further divide the American couple. After a year of uncertainty, they decide to climb the mountain again. The wife makes it to the top this time. But along the way, she realizes her marriage can't be salvaged. The message on the last two pages seems to be that everything's okay, though, because she reaches the summit, and also she looks forward to tracking down the man whom she almost had an affair with earlier in the story, and presumably starting a new life with him.		If this is the kind of stuff that fills all the books on the "new releases" shelves at Barnes and Noble, no wonder so many American women suffer from depression and other emotional issues. They can't help it if they're reading a steady diet of stories by authors like Shreve.
1,Save yourselves, run.  This book is predictible trite and B-O-R-I-N-G.  This is one where don't let the reviews fool you.		I finished it only because I was out of country with no internet and couldn't download anything else.  Literally that is why I finished it.		The storyline sounds like something a 12 year old thinks would be romantic but if you are say 14 or above you will see it for what it is lame.  If you think this will be a hot read - think again - it is as cold as the castle the story is set in.  No chemistry - lots of telling, no showing, and caricature type characters.  Normally if I finish a book I can give it at least 2 stars, not in this case.  It is just that bad.
1,Not one thing uplifting about this story. I hated it. Cannot say one good thing. I cannot believe I wasted my time. I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth and I'm sick to my stomach.
1,I got though the first book ok. It wasn't bad so I continued to the next. I read the first page got grossed out by the marine wanting to spread his seamen all over his pregnant friend. Not a good way to start a book. The third i got a few pages into it and was just bored...next didn't grab me neither did the other 2?	Don't waste your money on tripe, the first book was ok so try and get that one I a single version the rest was just blah
1,I seriously cannot believe I spent over $7 on this book.  It is the worst book I've ever read.		The storyline seemed like a really cute one, so I was really excited to dive into this world.  However, the way that Elliot, the "Hero" of the book, spoke just was so unbelievable.  It's a present day setting, and Elliot is a Baron and he talks like he just walked out of a Jane Austen book.  He seems confused at some points when Alice makes little American sayings yet other times he seems to know it all.  I just couldn't get past the unbelievability of the story and the way they acted.  Within two days they went from detesting one another to in bed and the "Love Scenes" were so drawn out...		It just seemed more a book written around sex scenes than a story that included some steamy scenes.  I suppose if you love the "Soft Porn" book genre you'd love this.  It's like a historical sex modern book all wrapped into one.  I couldn't get past about 50% and I was just so bored and tired of the ridiculousness of the storyline that I just gave up.		I wish that Amazon had a THIS BOOK SUCKS return policy :(
1,I keep waiting for Richelle Mead to create a series that rivals "Succubus" but so far she's been a bit of a let down,		Her writing, while catchy and full of punch, seems to be mostly for teenage girls.  It's OK, but YA is not really for me, and those series (VA, Bloodline) start off strong, have lots of unique ideas (living vs undead vampires from Eastern European lore) but kind of fade away by the time they end. The Age of X series seems to have promise, grabbing both a dytopic USA and Norse mythology, but RM doesn't really seem too interested in exploring it.		Soundless starts off with an unusual, innovative idea, of a society, high on a mountain in China where everyone is deaf. Great idea! But it's soon obvious and predictable.  (Spoiler alert) As soon as we know there's a mine, we know where that's going. Black lung, Byssinosis, Asbestosis are no secret, as are cancer-cells centers like Love Canal. From there on, the story gets rather predictable and pedestrian. Still, I was enjoying it until the ridiculous, and weak Deus Ex Machina ending.  Fantasy is fine, but it seems slapped on and lifted from JRR Tolkien.  If it worked, it would be fine.  But it doesn't.		The punchy, tongue-in-cheek style of adult humor of the Succubus series was what first attracted me to Richelle Mead's books--from the blurb of a succubus in Seattle with great shoes but no social life, to her crackpot, silly fiendish friends.  While that series is done, I keep hoping RM will be inspired to come up with something equally sassy and grown-up.
1,Characters are bad, the main character is the worst. I can't read a book when I absolutely hate the main character. The only one I like is Ace and that's only a semi-like...
1,if only i'd read the poor reviews, before reading. i kept reading...hoping it would get better--it never did.	no plot, and certainly no mystery, whatsoever.	the more you read, the dumber the story gets.	a complete waste of reading time.
1,Predictable, big on sex, short on substantive story line.
1,This book was just okay, not my cup of tea. The two main characters were too busy obsessing over each other and their sexual attraction and previous history than focusing on their jobs. That completely overshadowed what could have been a good storyline. I was very disappointed since I really enjoyed another book by Robin Perini, 'Forgotten Secrets'. I guess I just need to stay away from Montgomery Justice Novels.
1,Hard to read. I really wanted to read this but the style and the incessant whining on the same things really got old, then impossible to continue. I just couldn't finish it even though I think the story itself is worthwhile. The story-teller lost me.
1,I am ready to admit that it is my fault that I don't like this Tom Clancy (or whoever wrote it) novel. I am just not ready for the silliness of computer programmers, concerned about and employed to combat cyber crime, espionage, dirty tricks, and viruses, writing code to make their job into a computer game just to make work fun. The story line was as unbelievable as, and read like, a comic book, but as far as i could determine, did not have pictures. This is the first and the last of my "Clancy" novels.... I just don't have enough reading time to waste on trash stories when there are so many good books available. Maybe if I went back to the 1980's books that Clancy really wrote, I would have a better impression of his genre, but I doubt that I will.
1,New world order propaganda on how they are going to release bioweapons and kill everyone so that the remaining sheep must embrace the govt
1,How I wish I could have given this book a positive review. I love alternative history and I'm particularly fascinated by Kennedy-era stories. But as a professional writer and editor, I just can't get past the grammatical errors, punctuation problems, misspelled words and names, and general sloppiness that took away from what is a very interesting, imaginative story. If you're not someone who is bothered by such things, add a couple of stars. But if you like your books error-free, watch out.
1,Couldn't get into the book, at all. Wouldn't recommend.
1,I'm not sure Dick did much of the writing and if he did this book seemed totally unbelievable.  I was looking for something I could believe in, but found myself feeling like I was watching some action movie, without all the special effects.  It may work for a movie, but the book just did nothing for me.  Don't waste your time.
1,Misread about this book. Not for me . The recipes are not what I expected. My interpretation of keto and low carb are not the same as theirs. But other people have enjoyed it. Just wish I could return it but have waited too long so I'll donate it to my local library.
1,Ok, this book was total disaster to me compared to some of the author's other books. The hero and heroine dialogues were kinda like banter between kids with no idea what they try to achieve ?? And we didn't understand what exactly is her job except escort, which kinda is not done, because she doesn't know she is paid for that. What is going on half the time is not clear to me. Overall confusing story line ,no chemistry between H/H according to me/ they just jump to bed with no build up for their desire or any indication of it/. The heroine is behaving strange for abused kid - she was behaving like spoiled child, who needs her wishes done in the second???
1,An unusual plot, but it drags slowly on, through many characters, side digressions, etc.  A criminal who is smart, rich, and seems to treat crime as a game.  It never comes to a satisfying conclusion, either for Richard Jury or for the reader.
1,If you really cared, you'd join and fight with us side by side. We don't need people telling us we're heroes, we need more hereos. You are still young enough. Really care? Join us Sean!
1,I like the overall size of the Bible, but it is NOT large Print,I like the overall size of the Bible, but it is NOT large Print
1,This book is written with no quotations.  It was really annoying to read a book like that.  I read about 6 chapters and I couldn't take it anymore.
1,Bellum has gone AWOL and left her husband and home in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  She is already suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from her past deployments and can't stomach the idea of another one.  She follows an older veteran that has set up a camp for homeless veterans called The Standard Grande.  Milt inherited The Standard Grande, an old resort in the Catskills, from his father-in-law and uses it to help veterans become more self-sufficient and acclimate to coming home from a war environment.  Milt is under water on the venture, though, and is being aggressively pursued by a company that wants to use the land for what they say is a golf resort.  The veterans aren't so sure that is the real purpose, though.		This book just didn't hit the spot for me.  Most of the story dragged.  I didn't find it humorous and the mystery wasn't enough to keep my attention.  I actually had to leave this book several times and come back to it while reading other books in order to finish it.  There were some questions that I had throughout the book but the book ended without ever answering those questions, ruining any chance of any mystery with a climactic ending.  The writing is strange and very choppy.  I did enjoy Bellum's character and Bellum's story about her childhood and marriage made me understand why she did certain things later.  Most of the characters were very interesting but I think I enjoyed their back stories more than I enjoyed the story about The Standard Grande and IRJ's reasons for wanting to buy it.  This book did have some information about PTSD but I think I would have enjoyed the story more if it had focused on those aspects.  Overall, I just didn't like this book.  I think it would be good for someone that enjoys military banter and doesn't mind when a mystery is not solved at the end of a novel.  It just wasn't my cup of tea, though.		I received an advanced copy of this book in order to write an honest review.  All opinions are my own.
1,like/love
1,Please, if you want to know something about the Vietnam War, this is not the book to read. It is so heavily-biased that I stopped believing in the validity of what the author was saying after a few chapters. Unfortunately, I was forced to read this for a college course. I am a book-lover who keeps the dumbest of novels because I can't throw a book away, but this goes right into the trash when I finish the course next week. Thankfully, the book will no longer be used by the college after my class is ended.		 First of all, Young draws on a lot of resources to give you her story. Sometimes these resources are not identified and you wonder if a friend of hers may have been quoted. She quotes people who have the worst of things to say, but you never know who these people are to say such things. She blames the US for everything awful that ever happened in Vietnam and the vicinity. (on pages 283-284 she actually blames US bombing for the horrors commited by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge!) Chapter 8, which begins US ground troops in Vietnam, starts out with, "The growing disaster..." Disaster? The war hasn't even gotten underway and already it's a disaster. She omits the crimes of the Viet Cong or the NVA or sometimes skims over them as if they were no big deal.		 I have always been fully aware that the US did some awful things in Vietnam, but this book insists that we were the devil at all times who were out only to murder and terrorize the Vietnamese, while the NLF were angels who only wanted to do what was best for the poor people. 2 million people fled Vietnam in boats after the communist take-over of the country, across cruel ocean waters, but according to the book (page 310) they did so because of the US trade embargo.		 This is an author with an agenda that means more to her than fairness or accuracy. It does not give you the Vietnamese side of the story, but an anti-American side of the story and that's not the same thing. Please, if you want to learn something about the Vietnam War, do yourself a favor and read something else.
1,Also appears on The Screaming Nitpicker.		For some reason, all of Eden's friends and family are forgetting her. Her dreams of getting out of her tourist town and living on her own are going up in smoke and death isn't looking too terrible. Then along comes Az, a guy she meets on the beach and who drops her such a ridiculous pick-up line that she went out with him. Two weeks later and in love, she discovers his big secret: he's an angel, part Fallen and struggling to keep from finishing his Fall. Shortly after, she dies and awakens as a Sider, someone with the power to spread Touch to humans. She is trying to gain control of her unusual powers, but her connection to Az means that she will not be left alone.		The book's biggest problem is in its premise, specifically how people become Siders when they commit suicide. After their death and sometimes before, their friends and family will forget who they are. This apparently leads to their fate, in many cases. Was there a good reason all the Siders had to be forgotten? Couldn't their family and friends have remembered them after they died? The only reason I can think of against this is that it would make it difficult for the Siders to start over elsewhere. But the message that people who kill themselves are forgotten? Not funny. As someone who has experienced suicidal urges before, this is upsetting. Imagine how that might be for someone who still struggles with those feelings!		There were still a few holes in the mythology when I finished the book, mostly having to do with why Siders exist, but I did appreciate that some questions were answered. Why Eden is a special Sider? That does have an answer, though it doesn't come out until the very end. It's no case of Unreasonable Special here, folks. The mythology used in the novel was an interesting one, but my irritation with most of the cast kept me from enjoying it fully. The vocabulary of Siders, Upstairs, Downstairs, Fallen, etc. was easy to connect and follow. It does make me wonder why the author couldn't just use Heaven and Hell because we all know that's what they were. Not really a problem so much as a wayward thought of mine.		The characters. Where do we start? Eden. What I did like about her was that she was rightfully angry when it came out that Az and Gabriel knew what her future was and didn't try to tell her about Luke. It makes my blood boil when I see heroines be okay with other people doing "what's best for them" without ever talking to them, and the way no one ever seemed to trust her with anything made me angry with her. Then she would act high and mighty over other Siders and I would want to scream at her. Being able to kill them does not put her on a pedestal above them because she's still a Sider just like they are. Due to how they become Siders, I don't see how one would be superior to another.		Az did not win much favor from me either, what with how he manipulated Eden and planned to make her kill herself "for her own good." How is it that a centuries-old immortal acts like a fourteen-year-old boy when he falls in love, by the way? I find that an little unrealistic (and don't say anything about realism in a fantasy novel because I've already heard it). All we see is their first date. There's a two week time skip and now they're in love. The romance is a big motivator for Eden and Az, so this needs to be believable for it to work. Without development, their romance is unbelievable and the story suffers for it.		Just about the only member of the cast I liked was Kristen because she was delightfully unbalanced and interesting. Everyone else, from Adam the possessive boy toy (seriously, lay off--the girl chose you and you should trust her, not get possessive every time Az comes around) to Gabriel the angel (who constantly said Eden should get back with Az or else he would Fall--way to pressure her, man) to Libby the other Sider, got on my nerves. I would only read further books if they were about Kristen and how she runs her household.		I will give A Touch Mortal credit where credit is due. In the last fifty pages, I was honestly interested in what happened. I knew Eden and Az would be fine and one of the villains would die, but I wanted to see what else would happen. One big twist was visible from a mile away, but the other was completely unexpected and left a lot open for the sequel. The way all the Sider and Upstairs and Downstairs stuff goes without explanation can annoy some readers, but I liked that. I got the hang of it easily and appreciated that the author seemed to think their readers intelligent enough to figure it out themselves. I'm sick of authors talking down to me with stuff like that.		According to what I found on author Leah Clifford's website, this is the first book in a planned trilogy. Because of my dislike of most of the characters and the suicide thing mentioned much earlier, there is no way I am going to read the next two books. Feel free to try it for yourself, though. Maybe you'll like it more than I did. I should have known better--angel books and I don't mix. At least the mythology and angels weren't what made me mad this time.
1,Too many characters
1,I thought this would be the answer to organizing a household of 4, plus all our myriad guests and family. In reality, it's so big and bulky it was hard to find a spot for it. Once we did, we just didn't find we were keeping it up. It seems in the digital age, using a (gasp) pen and (gasp) paper has become too inconvenient.		The other odd thing about this calendar is that it runs the wrong way. Names are across the top. Days/dates are down the vertical. So this is a 90 degree turn from way most of us look at calendars where the days/dates go left to right (like in Outlook, Google calendar, and even 30 day paper calendars). Just too difficult to get used to.		It's shame b/c the concept in theory is great.
1,Not many recent reviews of this book. Not surprising. It is hardly one of the author's best and now seems quite dated, both in terms of its portrayL of science communications and its bizarre racial and class stereotypes. The basic idea is great, and it ends with a real gee-whiz moment and some thoughtful considerations on the nature of evolution and existence. But, man oh man, in between! Not sure why Benford chose a youngish African-American female as his protagonist, except as a high-risk adventure or as an excuse to armor himself as he launches into diatribes on race relations. But then again he goes off on New Age, the media, lazy students, university administrators, politicians, conspiracy wackjobs, and just about anything else you might espy when you open up the morning paper. Now if all this pontificating were integrated into the plot, or if the discoveries of the Cosm itself were allowed to play against the pettiness of humanity, you might admire the construct, or at least the attempt. But so much of this is just paragraphs of useless drivel and commentary dropped into the middle of an aimless, loopy plot. Going with Benford on a girl's night out is truly a horrific experience, so no wonder the protagonist has so much trouble getting laid. And the kidnapping and the evil-eye cop? Red herrings or just dead fish to begin with?
1,no review
1,Did not like the book. It's message didn't resonate with me.
1,Horrible
1,It could have been an interesting read, a gripping story and even a terrific movie script.  But Michael Marshall's writing leaves quite a bit to be desired.  If you are used to reading "fast reads" and Stephen King, so be it, you'll probably like this kind of tripe.  But even Stephen keeps his political commentary to a minimum and stays on track.	If Mr. Marshall would have kept the narration in the first person - or just stuck with one POV throughout - I'd have really liked this book much better He switches tacts at least 4 times, and that really starts to make things confusing.  As well, there are too many "quick fixes" to his plot line which make the seemingly two seperate story lines come together rather conveniantly.	The completely unnatural dialog is laughable in places, nearly sounding like a bad Japanese re-write for American cinema.  Examples:	"That's the web for you, a deaf and dumb oracle with amnesia"	"I feel negative, good thing I've got a happy android for company.  But if you use that voice again and I'm going to knife you"	"I think now would be a good time to blow Dodge"	and on and on.	He tries hard to save the book with gratuitous violence which seems to serve no purpose other than make an OK story seem bigger than life and also tends to ramble on (through the character's voices, of course) about humanity, the human condition, America, society, et al.  It just gets old and also gets in the way of the story.	The epilogue is just about the worst part, a 5-page rambling that could have easily been boiled down to 2.	A good book for the 20-something crowd, but seasoned readers will find too many similarities to X-files and other TV-genre pulp.  Is Mr. Marshall aiming at Hollywood?  Perhaps, but in the end, (and unlike many other reviewers here) I found this not to be a page-turner, but a slow read that I slogged through just to say I finished it.  Guess I'm just that kind of guy, I want my money's worth.  As I turned the last page I felt pretty ripped off, however.
1,It's really too bad.  I looked forward to this book, pounced on it, and then it's just.....meh.		I didn't expect the main character to be as beguiling as Phaedra, but this one is outright stupid, careening from one sexual encounter to another and letting herself be used by anyone who wants to use her.  The whole first half of the book is just Too Much Information about her gonads.  Cringeworthy and crude, it reads like a sex manual and none of the sex advances the plot.		When she gets to Asia,  the book brightens up a bit but ultimately disappoints.  I fully expected to read one of Carey's interesting takes on an ancient civilization like the skillful renderings she did of Rome, Germany and France but she skips right over the subtleties of  Chinese art and history  to concentrate on a military battle.  She mentions a kimono and the Great Wall, and that's it for thousands of years of eastern culture. Clearly she didn't research this book as thoroughly as she did the first three or she would have found something more interesting to write about than this.		As for her other characters, the elderly wise man who's supposed to be the soul of the book sounds like a fortune cookie-- and what's worse, all her lovers are boring and underwritten.  The only character in this book that got and kept my attention for its originality was not a human and I don't suppose he'll make a reappearance anytime soon.		It's really too bad.  She had a chance to recreate the whole of a fabulous, glittering society, it's intricate politics, literature and architecture, and she let it slip through her fingers in favor of an earlier publishing date.  She's such a good writer than you keep turning pages even when you don't particularly like the tale, but  this is a woefully subpar effort for an author so gifted.
1,Dated material, technology to complete the few interesting projects is VERY old, and items needed for those projects no longer exist.  There are projects that are incomplete, only partial instruction provided. I can't believe the publisher put this book out with missing sections.	Some interesting reading for a few minutes, but really not worth the money.
1,Miss Kennealy,		I read a very interesting article about you. It is entitled "Stuff Patricia Kennealy Wants Forgotten". (Potential scam victims who may be interested in purchasing this book can easily find the article online, just Google the article's title.) Here is a sample of the article that should give you an idea of why I am about to say what I am about to say:		--"But she has reasons for not wanting people to read this (Rock Wives), this book was published five or six years before Strange Days and the DRASTIC revision of her role in Jim Morrisons life. Kennealy seemed to have been content to simply be the second-string girlfriend. So she says a LOT of things that are completely opposite what she would later allege about the relationship."--		In interviews you talk about the "life" you had with Jim Morrison. Turns out you were a one-night stand, if that, who tried unsuccessfully to elbow her way into Morrison's and to get him to take you on as his legitimate partner through sheer aggression. (Sitting his long-time live-in girlfriend and companion to tell her that you had just aborted Jim Morrison's baby? That is straight out of the "Aggressive, Psychotic Stalker Handbook". Oh, many of your former acquaintances have helpfully pointed out that you were not sure who the father of the baby really was since your "soul-mate" wasn't the only man you had been with.)		You like to tell people that Jim Morrison showered you with love letters, poems and jewelry during your "relationship" with him. I do not believe you have ever produced any of these letters for anyone to authenticate them. (Hell, I'd even demand you turn over the jewelry he bought you so I could track down the merchant and then I would probably only come to find out that you purchased the jewelry yourself.) Andy Morrison, your "husband's" younger brother, has publicly called you out saying that Jim Morrison's signature on that "marriage certificate" is a forgery.		About that marriage certificate. I couldn't help but come across it online. What is with all of the redacted information? What are you hiding? Were there witnesses there who, if asked, might reveal that you yourself did not take the ceremony at all seriously and that the "groom" was too wasted to realize what exactly was really happening? Is that the problem? No matter. You know yourself that your little "marriage" would never be considered legal anywhere in the U.S. and probably anywhere in the world.		Caught your online rant regarding "Angels Dance & Angels Die". It appears if one value's one's personal safety they will not even attempt to say anything positive about Pamela Courson or even, for a second, look at her in any kind of sympathetic light. So many years later and you can go home and sleep at night after trashing an addicted, unhinged 27 year-old young woman who spent that last few years of her short and unhappy life dealing with the trauma and circumstances of Morrison's death and basically dying of grief and guilt feelings. (Don't you claim to practice Wicca? Does Wicca have any views regarding morals and compassion for others?) I knew you were about go full-on nasty when I read your demand for people to use your LEGAL SURNAME - your caps, not mine - and when you said about Pamela Courson, "Oh, and what did the poor baby die of?" You are enough to make anyone's stomach turn.		Like her, love her or hate her, the truth is that Pamela Courson loved Jim Morrison before he became a famous rock star and remained by his side until the terrible, bitter end. Jim Morrison dedicated his poetry books to Pam, not you. Jim Morrison lived with Pam, not you. Jim Morrison took Pam to Doors-related functions and outings, not you. Jim Morrison wrote songs about Pam, not you. Jim Morrison wrote letters and poems to Pam, not you. Jim Morrison bought jewelry for Pam, not you. Jim Morrison turned to Pam in his darkest hours and darkest days, not you. (Morrison's final will and testament reads: "To whom it may concern I bequeath all of my worldly possessions to my only companion in life, Pamela Susan Courson..." In case you didn't hear that, "my only companion in life". Sorry, I know that's gotta sting.)		In print you have loudly and publicly accused Pamela Courson of murdering Jim Morrison because you were convinced that he was going to leave her at any moment (every stalker's favorite fantasy). Miss Kennealy? If you knew your "husband" as well as you claim you did then you would know that up until the final months of his life Jim Morrison was vehemently opposed to Heroin use. You would know that the biggest fights he and Pam would have were over her dabbling in the drug and that he routinely lectured Danny Sugerman on the evils of becoming a Heroin addict. No one "got" Jim Morrison to start dabbling in Heroin, he did on his on free will because that's where he was mentally and emotionally at that time, in a state of despair. Not because someone else told him to. (It's obvious to every Doors fan out so I am surprised it is not obvious to his "wife" that Jim Morrison did not take kindly to being told what to do and had an incredibly strong will when he wanted to.)		Like smelling a milk that has gone bad before you pour it down the drain I read the interview you did with Mongrel Patriot Review. In it you claim to have "been with" Jim Morrison during his trial in Miami. "With him". Really? That's funny because Jim Morrison's good friend and body guard, Tony Funches, who was also with Morrison at the trial, tells a very different story. You were harassing Jim, coming into the courtroom to give him a hard time because he did not want you as his girlfriend. Aggressively pursuing him, stalking him and harassing him during the most humiliating, painful and frightening times of his life. Yeah, I can see how much you "loved" Jim Morrison.		Funches goes on to say that Jim Morrison did not want you there and was not happy to have you there (Funches also uses some blunt, ungentlemanly language to describe how he and every single person Jim's and The Doors' circle felt about you and I don't blame him one bit.) For those who wish to read this interview just Google "tony funches interview Miami kennealy".		In the same interview you chuckled about Jim's "dry humor" during his testimony and laugh about how he knew he was doomed and decided to have as much "fun" as possible during the proceedings. Really? Hmmmm. From I, and any one who actually knew Jim Morrison, can gather, this case hung over Morrison's head for about two years, screwed up professional opportunities for he and the band and had him contemplating suicide at one point. So my feeling is that he was desperately hoping for a not guilty verdict. Him fleeing the U.S. to France with whom the U.S. has extradition treaty with didn't tell you anything Miss Kennealy?		I don't think you knew your "husband" very well at all. No, you are just a mentally unhealthy, aggressive, vindictive, self-serving, deluded would-be groupie, parasitic, opportunistic, compulsive liar and a fame seeking, vindictive stalker. (You're even violent. Didn't you brag in print that you slammed a young girl's head into a wall because she was flirting with Jim Morrison?)		Anyone thinking of spending so much as a penny on this, or even accepting for free as gift I strongly advise you not to. Miss Kennealy is not a nice person and has a very, very bad relationship with reality and with the truth. (Miss Kennealy, I saw where, about a year and a half ago, you were offering to give away copies of this book for free for anyone who wanted one. Are you that desperate to have people read this insane piece of fan fiction? And then maybe sit there with your fingers crossed hoping they believe every word?)		For a truthful and accurate telling of what actually went on between Miss Kennealy and Jim Morrison you can find a VERY revealing article entitled "Your Ballroom Days Are Over Baby" by Janet Erwin (keep in mind Erwin considered Kennealy a friend at one point). Google "tiffany talks your ballroom days are over baby" and you should find it. Quote: "This piece was originally written as an expose of Patricia Kennealy and what those of us who were there and know what really happened regard as a series self-serving lies about what was in fact a very brief romantic relationship with the late Jim Morrison. However, twelve years have passed since the original Ballroom Days was published in The Doors Collectors Magazine 1999 Annual, and the last of the "kiss and tells"--Linda Ashcroft's entirely fictional Wild Child, based on Kennealy's heavily fictionalized Strange Days--was published in 1998."		I would wish you luck Miss Kennealy but at this point you are beyond all hope. People I know personally have described how...how shall I put this?....unsatisfying your life is now. Can't say I surprised given your personality and rage issues. I guess you are an example of "what goes around, comes around".		Save your money and your time Jim and Doors fans. (Stop bothering people Miss Kennealy.)
1,Save your money and just get Paul White's 'Creative Recording 1 & 2' books.		Unfortunately I found out (too late) that these 'Basic' series are a direct (and sometimes even a condensed) extract from the 'Creative Reading 1 & 2' books, which I already owned.		Therefore the 'Basic' series is a VERY expensive way to get access to all of Paul White's great information found in 'Creative Reading 1 & 2' books.
1,NOT! So many times I have tried to catch up with classics I missed reading when I was younger. I found this almost impossible to wade through. I never finished it.
1,Mrs. Saint was an interesting character but the primary focus was single mom, Markie was a very passive/aggressive individual.  I had a hard time feeling sorry for her.  Also, the story of Mrs. Saint was overly long and retold too many times.
1,Sorry folks, I can't really recommend this book. I didn't find Maizie at all entertaining. I found her to be spoiled, boring, and so self centered I wanted to tell her to her face how much I disliked her. This was a book I had to force myself to read and the whole time wished I wasn't wasting my time.
1,I just returned the kindle edition for a refund.  Already found buggy code in chapter three for simple macros.
1,What a tremendously boring book!	I got 1/3 into the book and have to stop. The whiny stick up his butt, my mommy doesn't love me protagonist is way more than I can stand.	Or maybe it's the 'McHale's Navy' portrayal of the RMN.	I've read the first 1/2 dozen Honor Harrington books and thought they were great! I had to stop when they became so formulaic and predictable.	I have enjoyed books by both authors, and have their names on my short list of great scifi writers, but frankly they blew it on this one.
1,The central idea in this book is to get you to view your own life from the perspective of your deathbed, and from there you'd be better abled to really determine what's important in life.  The idea is good, and the four questions that the author presents in order to deepen your perspective work well enough, but this by all means is anything but new or groundbreaking.  These ideas have been around for ages.		I agree with the reviewer that said this book could have been easily condensed into a chapter and the main idea would be illustrated just as well.  I regret paying $18 dollars for this.  If you are still curious please check this out at the library or buy it used.
1,I thought it was going to be an interactive book like the "dont let the pigeon drive the bus".	My son loves every single book he has...except for this one. Actually is kind of boring for a toddler, probably better if the child is older. I will put it away and introduce it again in a few months/years...
1,While there were many interesting ideas to think about while reading this speculative fiction, there were not enough answers for me at the end of the book.  Also, my ideas of the Bible and Christianity differ from the author's.  I found myself mentally arguing with his views.
1,James Patterson should have read "Sail" more closely after Howard Roughan wrote it and it was released in Patterson's name.  The story was so full of cliches and often-repeated words and tired phrases: "to say the least"; "Come to think of it"; "Let's just say . . . "; "not to mention . . . ".  Airplanes, by the way, do not go into an uncontrollable dive if the engine loses power.  They glide to a landing.  Research, research, research!  And where would a snake that size find food between stranded sailors?  Also, how in the world did a snake get to a remote island?  The writing should have carried the reader along, but was so distracting it was hard to stay focused on what could have been a pretty good tale.  Patterson needs to know that when he teams up with someone, the product should mirror the author's own skills.  He won't get many chances at future sales if he turns out more stinkers like this one.
1,i was given this book as a gift.  i am surprised at the illogic of this very gifted thinker.	he says he will disprove the existence of God.  then he attacks the bible, pointing out errors, inconsistencies, and contradictions.  having done a good job of doing that, he then steps back beaming and says, 'therefore, God doesn't exist.'	nonsense, he has simply proven that the bible is not infallible.  you cannot prove that God doesn't exist anymore than you can prove that God does exist.  it is mystery, not logic.	the book could be of interest if you want to know more about the bible, it won't help you any about God, one way or the other.	the title should be "proof that the bible is not infallible" or if he wants to be cute, "the bible delusion".
1,Silly fishing story.
1,I couldn't read the book because it smelled so funky!	I put it outside for three days and  it still smells awful ( no reflection on Stephen Hawking)  .Perhaps the book warehouse needs a  fumigation.
1,Forced myelf to finish the book (which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).  Cultures collide when a spoiled English family crash their lives, their budget & their vintage Mustang (literally) with an Amish buggy on their way "back home to Mama."  Unrealistic & Predictable.  I really wanted to like it.  At times, the author actually had good descriptive writing. . .otherwise, it plodded along (like a Clydesdale in deeep mud).
1,The tale is getting ragged, the twists are overplayed, and the droning text (frequently mistaken for creative prose), makes caring for the characters and their causes more than a minor struggle. I might read the next book in the series, but only because I stumble across it in the bargain bin.
1,I cannot see the point of this book. There is no story, only a few pages of pop-up trains.
1,Cashing in on your son's demise...how low can you go?
1,The premise that someone can use drugs as extensively as the "hero" and not suffer more significant consequences is a little hard to believe...as well as there would be a love connection between the two of them.
1,There are several cons to this book:		 It is a fictional account, not a biography.  I wouldn't have purchased it if I'd known that.		 The author's style, or perhaps the translator's, is stiff and forced. The fictional love interest is pornographic.		 The attitude that adultery is okay as long as everyone's enjoying themselves is pushed throughout the book.  One wonders if the author, on finding his wife in bed with someone else, would actually say, "Oh, well, as long as you're enjoying yourself that's all that matters."  Doubtful.		There are also some pros to it:		 It makes the point that, no matter how good the intent, like opposing Hitler, someone who works against his country in time of war is despised by *both* sides for being a traitor.		 It also makes clear that in war people you care about can get hurt, no matter how hard you try to prevent it.		I'd've liked it better if it was an actual biography. As is, one doesn't know how much to believe, beyond the fact that the man did exist and did defy Hitler at incredible personal risk.
1,I love bad romance books but there's a point when it gets too wild, I knew what I was buying but I really wouldn't recommend the series to anyone.
1,It's vulgar, silly; should be listed under porn.  Had read a better summary review I would not have ordered it.	Sorry.
1,I kept checking back for this one, with so many others who have written reviews here, and was disappointed (like so many others). It was at first difficult for me to give an accurate star rating because it is clouded by disappointment: I expected book 3, but feel like this is book 4. Pogue is a good writer. Develops characters and story well. And I so enjoyed the first two in this series. One cares deeply for so many of the characters in these first two books. The Taryn character is not someone you care to follow, however.  And I felt no passion for any of the characters this time. New or old.
1,I found this book dull, dull, dull. I didn't  like any of the characters.  As I read through it as little as I could	I wanted to edit  most of the sentences.  My mistake again--not reading the reviews.
1,Amazon should be making original print date, regardless of format, cover art etc available for all books. This is readily available data and should be displayed. Anything less, and authors, publishers and amazon are just taking advantage of their customers. Buy a clue and some ethics already. BTW the earlier version is also less expensive...	http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Heat-Kat-Martin-ebook/dp/B003KN3JPM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1391501602&sr=8-3&keywords=Desert+heat
1,Some people can't handle one star reviews and whine to Amazon to have them removed! Thank GOD I can still re-review the book, and will forever be able to. Terrible book, children hate it and run away screaming when I bring it out.
1,I'm in the process of reading this book. Very disappointed in the story line in this book. I'm more use to Diana romance story line from of her other books. This so far have not keep my interest. I were looking for some of Diana work that she did in books "Mericiless & True Blue. If you are willing to shell out the money for this book, I wish you luck.
1,Without cutting any of the story. Like all Gor books, this one has a lot of slavery nonsense in it. However, in this case it's particularly egregious, because the slaves play no real part in the story at all. In fact, the ending is radically padded with a couple of entirely unrelated characters who appear to be there solely to insert two or three chapters of the slavery drumbeat again.		I bought this book because some have said that after Kur of Gor, the quality had increased back to the levels of the first six books. This is false. When I can remove entire chapters from the book without a reader even noticing, Norman has finally reached his limit. If you skip through the slavery, this isn't a novel, it's a pamphlet.
1,What a disappointment! The book ended without any explanation about what happened to the young girl. Did the author die or something. Total wast of reading time!
1,This is easily the worst book I have ever read.  The portrait of the characters is one dimensional, the dialogue ls silly, the plot is nonexistent.  The survivors  lack survival skills s simple as knowing  a serial killer will kill again.  The anti-white racism (there I said it) is sickening.  If this is a comedy and I enjoy dark comedy,  it is so out there that only  racist, christian hating bigot would find it amusing.  I down loaded it when it was free and it was not worth the money then.
1,The basic story was an excellent one, and I got very interested in it. However, the flood of similes and metaphors, only some of which were appropriate, made it hard to wade through.		I persevered until about 1/4 from the end of the book, the basic plot ended, and with it my interest in suffering through the author's writing. I won't reveal what happened, in case you prefer your prose purple and read this book.
1,i did not find this book challenging. though its introduction is one of the most beautiful introductions of any book i have ever read. i reccomend it to those who wish to see parallels between the christian and buddhist paths, though of these parallels, it is the compassion/loving kindness practice that is expressed in the introduction that matters most.		the presentation is nice, but it in my opinion says nothing that cant be read in the scriptures. it just seemed a little superficial to me, and as i said, only took three hours to read. big on presentation, little on substance.		there will be those that will say that "you are disrespectful of these two great teachers"... well so be it. i hope i am not.		God knows why i wrote in the earlier post that the buddha is not a source and great fire of love... sometimes the ignorance in my own words dazzles me! the buddha in my opinion has an even more compassionate teaching than jesus. though i am myself a christian, i am dazzled by his love for the evil. and shake at the buddhas teaching of compassion. unlike Jesus, the buddha never cursed anyone or anything... not even a fig tree. Jesus may love hypocrites, but he will apparently watch them go to a fiery hell as a just and fair judgement... fair yes, but not merciful. the buddha would never wish or inflict pain on anyone or anything. therefore my statement stands. the buddha was and may still be more compassionate than jesus.		but... in the end, it is jesus who made the ultimate sacrifice. "if i be lifted up (crucified), i shall draw all men unto me". lets hope that Julian of Norwich is divinely inspired when she says that through God: "all will be well and all will be well, and all manner of things will be well." i don't think i could die for Jesus, but he died for me. now that speaks. the word in action, is a true word indeed.		isnt it remarkable how ignorant one can be at times! i can see my own ignorace and it sometimes worries me!		my only bug-bear with marcus borg is his aversion to the literal ressurection and virgin birth. two things that i strongly believe in.	but then we all have blind spots, and isn't true love/loving kindness far more important than what we believe? i think so.		with love, from, snow-flake. xxx		still learning, still on the path (i hope!)
1,I've read all the Joe Sandilands mysteries, as well as the Leatitia Talbot ones, and have found them to be generally entertaining, with a few that were wonderful (The Last Kashmiri Rose, Tug of War). But this must be the first book I have ever given up on within 20 pages from the end. I know that heroes of light suspense books are allowed to have an infinite cast of clever/stalwart/ingenious connections, and I can overlook the fluctuating personalities and sudden new abilities of the characters (I even got past the last novel's awkward culmination of a predictable, but still somewhat disturbing, "romance"). But the endless tedious dialogue towards some vague political plot just finally became too much to wade through. I kept hoping my interest would be sparked by more insight into that volatile period leading up to World War II, but all the intrigue and possible leads and double-crossing just didn't add up to a interesting story. Here's hoping her next book gives us the well-plotted twists and compelling stories she's offered in the past.
1,THIS IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES, START HERE AND READ THEM ALL. ARCHER IS THE BEST STORY TELLER OF ALL. YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG.
1,After a 3 month wait for this book to become available at my local library, I opened it with excitement and anticipation.  While I knew the book was a hot read in Christian circles, I avoided any reviews at first as I was afraid I would learn something that would make the book less interesting for me. The first several chapters were not disappointing in that it seemed a great plot was unfolding that tugs at your heartstrings in the deepest of ways.  I found myself literally in tears after a few chapters.  The language was a bit flowery and indulgent at first to a degree that it was distracting, but that became less of an issue further into the book.		However, I think that it is with great caution that a sincere person attempts to write God into a work of fiction in such an intimate way - specifically that an author would try to imagine what God would say to a person in any given situation without quoting scripture directly or at the very least relying heavily upon it.  To try to capture the essence of God and what he would be like in human form interacting with a person daily without relying solely on what is given in scripture about Jesus is not something to be taken lightly.  A difficult attempt to say the least - and something that was NOT done well in this book.		If you are looking for simply a good story and plot, you might as well read the first few chapters and skip to the end.  The rest of the book is an attempt to share ideas with the reader about why pain exists in the world without getting too preachy.  Which is why I feel the need to at least mention the theology present in the book.		Unfortunately, the ideas presented were neither cohesive, nor were they based solidly in Scripture.  It felt almost as if the author had been brainstorming, came up with his own ideas about why things are the way they are and then stated them as fact coming from God's mouth with nothing solid to ground it in.  To explore an idea is one thing, but to put the words in God's mouth is quite another.  This made the entire dialogue from the middle portion of the book difficult for me to swallow and I was so uncomfortable with much of it, that I couldn't wait to be done with the book.  I got bored in parts which is not something most people seem to being having a problem with.  I didn't think it flowed well either.  It seemed the author had a laundry list of things to address and was simply checking them off - trying to make them fit into the story rather than effectively using the story to address them.		Furthermore, the portrayal of God was, for lack of a better word, somewhat irreverent.  While the author is attempting to get the reader to think outside the box, I think he takes it a bit too far and portrays God as something less than holy rather than an Almighty God to be revered.  He overemphasizes one aspect of God (the loving side, which is important that we know) while completely missing the many other attributes that are equally important and make God who he is - all that assuming we could ever begin to know Him or understand the complexities of a holy and perfect God.  While there is value in stretching someone out of their comfort zone in order to find truth, I'm not sure that is what was happening here.  There was way too much comfort with just hanging out with God rather than coming to him in a respectful manner.  I will say that at the end of the book, God was portrayed in a manner that was much more reverent (more kingly and omnipotent - if you will), but it was too little, too late.		All that to say that there are some useful points in the book.  The author does explore some things that will definitely make you think about why you believe what you do and even has some answers for things that made me wonder if he was right.  While he hits the mark on some things, he is so far off on others that I could never recommend this book to anyone.  While there are truths tucked away in the book, there are things that strike me as too close to the edge in a world where the Truth is lost because it is manipulated and obscured by the deceiver.  If you choose to read this, I would urge you to do so with caution.
1,Reading this novel was like staring at a desert and waiting for it to change. Even the pages were barren, large paragraphs of monotonous (yet stylistic) descriptions with no end or dialogue in sight. This novel was hard to follow and nothing stand out occurred. I couldn't finish it because it was rather boring and left me really depressed.		Recommend for those who like westerns or ultraviolence.
1,This review will essentially be a rant.		  Why? Because I am annoyed beyond common sense with this author!		  First, my reading story with this serie : I read book 1 in french (the omnibus kind, that is composed by book 1 to 3). Was thrilled to finally find a great fiction book (with romance as a bonus) about magic. The Wicca kind not the HP one.		  I went to see if there were more books and yes! I was so pleased, I immediately made researches about them. BUT, crushed. What was this author thinking? She created a great story with a nice couple to just destroy that in the very next book! Plus, hinting that Morgan would find love again (right after the murder attempt by the "love of her live" missed)... I am an author as well, with some heavy baggage, but damn I do not write that kind of disgusting things!		  Let's state that I had not planned to read book 2 (books 4 to 6). Yet, as I received it at work (in french again) I found myself perversely curious and borrowed it. Hell was I surprised! I liked it. Even more than book 1... don't know why exactly but rooted for Hunter from the start. So I got book 3 and more in english (so, in fact, books 7 to 15, if you follow me).		  And there comes the furious rant : Why in hell? She keeps and keeps destroying the story! Lots of authors do like their characters but obviously that's not the case here...		  If book 7 was nice, book 8 was the last straw for me. Hunter. Hunter the nice, serious, caring guy who finally get his soulmate's love ,just randomly kissed a girl because he's missing Morgan... Pleaaaase.		  As for book 8 (after the kissing scene) to 14, I read nothing. Stop joking. BUT, I read book 15 and felt sick. So, Morgan "broke up" with her soulmate cause they live too far appart and, as it happened there's this random guy at her new coven that like her, so why not try him, to see. What??!! Then Hunter dies conveniently, so she can have random buddy without feeling guilty (if she ever was). she even states that she married him and ended in love with him (too, should I say?) before he dies (which is for the better considered the wife he got himself, pfff). For the record, she did have a hand-fasting with Hunter : already taken, how do you spell it? THEN, Hunter comes back to life and got her back : after all they were soulmates, weren't they? Excuse me if it wasn't that clear for you neither...		  I'm appalled by this author. And when you know that in the first book or her Immortals serie she creates a romance between a girl and the man that once sexually attacked her... I just tag her as sick and will never again inflict any other of whatever-you-want-to-name-her-scribbles upon me.		More reviews (not that bad I promise ;-)) on : [..]
