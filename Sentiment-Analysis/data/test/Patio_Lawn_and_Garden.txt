0,I like the ability to fold  it. Has plenty of power for lopping limbs
0,Arrived ahead of time and as advertised.  Perfect addition to the family tree at a good price.
0,This I bought for cleaning my Mobilehome.  Size is right and with the adapter brush I love it.  Not super powerful, but for what Im using it on, it's just right.
0,easy to use
0,Keeps the seeds warm and helps to be able to keep growing year round when in a state that doesn't enable this outside
0,I have two bags, one is out of the bot for washing/drying, while the other is working away.  Yes, it has no blue label for alignment, but that's o.k., as the seam aligns with the blue label on the frame, so no worries.		Update:  after a heavy early swim season with a lot of leaf pickup (my neighbor's tree -- don't get me started!), the bags have a funky smell, and not all the little lint bits are easily removable.  I have washed without soap by hand, and in the washing machine, per directions, but doesn't always get all the stuff out -- discovered a trick... in the washing machine, wash the bags inside out along with any coarse towels you happen to have around -- you know, the ones that are relegated to the garage.  The nap on the towels rubbing against the bags seems to loosen more small stuff.  I did not add soap, but did add some OxyClean (I know the smell doesn't matter at the bottom of the pool, but I couldn't help myself!).
0,Abolutely the most human easiest way to trap mice, we had a recent birthing in the house, so its been catching nonstop mice for a week.		Training the dog to mouse, the dog is a jack russell and does an amazing job. Nice to have real mice too use!		Put a little peanut butter on the back strut, make em stand on the plate and bam, new mouse every night!
0,Using Coolaroo Timber Fasteners, I hung Coolaroo Shade Fabric along the back of my pergola to stop the setting sun from blasting my windows.  It does the trick!  But my pergola is 18 feet wide and I only ordered one 15-foot roll of shade fabric, so there's a 3-foot gap on one side (as can be seen in the attached photos).  I anchored the loose bottom corner of the shade fabric to a wood post by using a dog leash.  I slipped the dog leash clasp between the weave of the shade fabric and tied the end of the leash to the wood post and hammered a nail into it so it wouldn't move up or down.  The shade fabric hasn't torn where the clasp is puncturing it, even though there have been some windy days where there was a lot of tension on it.  Of course I should have installed a grommet, but I didn't have one.		For my second project, I used black Coolaroo Medium Shade Fabric and Scotch Permanent Outdoor Mounting Tape to try to prevent passersby from being able to see into my home through my security screen door.  See the accompanying photos of the shade fabric taped to the inside of my security screen door.  The first photo shows the view from the inside looking outside.  The second photo shows the view from the outside, standing in front of the screen door.  The third photo shows the view from the outside, standing at an angle where you can still see my sliding glass patio door leading to the backyard.  I think I might be able to obscure the view of the sliding glass patio door if I put another layer of shade fabric on the security screen door.  Unfortunately, the tape didn't hold the fabric to the screen door for more than a few days, so I removed the tape and used 2 mm black nylon cable twist ties.  I slid the cable ties through the fabric and metal screen, twisted them, and cut off the ends.
0,Husband loves it.  Easier on his hands.
0,Ripped through 4 inch diameter branch effortlessly. Impressive. Feels sturdy in hands, well constructed
0,I like it! I like it!!!
0,works!
0,Love it so pretty!
0,Plan to grow these soon, but have not planted them yet.
0,Purchased for a large heater that I use on occasion with a 100# tank. Works fine.
0,Very sharp, very durable. These hedge shears are great.
0,Umbrella is fine.  I just ordered Terra Cotta and I guess that's what I got but a bit orange so it's in the garage and I ordered another one.
0,This bird feeder is well made and looks nice. The capacity is ample. When fully loaded with feed it weighs a fair amount.		It took the birds a few days to realize it was there, but now they are mobbing it.  Apparently it works mostly for small birds, since the perch is quite close to the opening where they get the seeds.  But that is fine; the large birds can find plenty of seeds at our other feeders.		We really like the new feeder, and so do the birds! Squirrels have a tough time getting past the canopy, so they're not too happy about it.
0,I chose this product because of the reputation of the Oregon brand and the reasonable price. Oregon makes a wide variety of products for a wide variety of chainsaw brands. I highly recommend this chain; you will not be disappointed.
0,Perfect
0,The blooms on this are about 8" across. Absolutely beautiful! I will be buying this again! They do grow tall so will need to be staked.
0,OEM replacement for my Toro Recycler...fit perfectly
0,Item fits perfectly - nuff said; Item fits perfectly - nuff said; Item fits perfectly - nuff said;Item fits perfectly - nuff said.
0,Great Cable very easy to install
0,Very thin piece of sheet metal but I do like the way it hangs.
0,Fits my pressure washer and my lawnmower. Glad to only have one part# to worry about.
0,Rebuilt a Stihl FS 36 trimmer carburetor (WT-106B) with this kit. All parts were included. Simple rebuild. Trimmer  runs very well. Cold started unit 4 times today. 2 pulls at the most and it runs.
0,Works just like you expect
0,This device works well with my Black & Decker string trimmer and edger. There's no need to worry about the string breakage or unwinding from the roll. The SpeedLoad Trimmer head replacement spool is a good way to finish the job without the annoyance of constantly fiddling with the twine.
0,I like this better than a bird bath because it is always drying out.  Now they can get water from a bird feeder.
0,I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE FOR MY MAGNET MATS AND IT WORKED JUST LIKE THE ADVERTISING SAID IT WOULD, OR IT WORKED ALMOST LIKE THE ADVERTIZING SAID IT WOULD.		THE MAT IS SUPPOSED TO ALLOW FOR ACCUMULATED WATER TO DRAIN OFF AND OUT UNDER AND DOWN THE SIDES OF THE MAT. IT IS ALSO DESIGNED SO THAT LEAVES AND THINGS THAT BLOW ONTO THE MATMATE BLOW OFF. AND IT WORKS PRETTY WELL. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT ONLY THREE STARS IF MY ENTRY WAY HAD BEEN POURED CORRECTLY WHEN THE CONCRETE WAS POURED; HOWEVER, IT WAS POURED WITH A LOW SPOT IN IT AND THAT LOW SPOT CAUSED ME AND THE MAT ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS,		SO CHECK TO SEE THAT YOUR ENTRY WAY IS LEVEL OR HIGH PRIOR TO PURCHASING ONE OF THESE.		BECAUSE OF MY CONCRETE PROBLES, MY MAT HELD WATER WHICH LED TO MOLD WHICH LED TO MOLD GROWING ALL OVER THE ENTIRE ENTRY WAY IN THE WINTER IOF 2013...NOT A GOOD THING.		IF YOUR CONCRETE IS POURED CORRECTLY OR, EVEN HIGH (I WOULD PREFRE RIGHT AS YOU STEP IN THE DOOR) THEN THE EXCESS WATER AUTOMATICALLY DRAINS AWAY AND YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS.		I TOOK THIS OUT ON MY DRIVEWAY ON A NICE LITTLE HIGH SPOT AND THE WATER LITERALLY GUSHED OFF THE MAT WHEN IT RAINED AND LEAVES FROM HERE AND THERE DID NOT END UP STACKED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER BUT BLEW AWAY. SOME STILL STUCK, SURE, THE THING IS RUBBER, BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE THEY DID WHEN THE MAT AND THE RUBBER BACKING WERE BOTH COATED WITH MOLD, DEAD INSECTS AND DEAD LEAVES. IT WAS NOT A PRETTY PICTURE.		NOW I HAVE A MATE MAT, BUT I DO NOT USE THE SCROLL TRAY AND I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS THOUGH WE HAVE HAD 5 TIMES THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF RAIN THIS YEAR THAT WE USUALLY HAVE. SO I SUGGEST THAT IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT THE RUBBER MATMATE, THAT YOU DO SO.		IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE YOU REALLY NEED THE RUBBER SCROLL TRAY----AND IT DOES LOOK EVER SO NICE, THEN USE IT IF YOU HAVE ADEQUATE DRAINAGE OR IF YOU SLIT THE BOTTOM OF THE TRAY AND MAKE MORE ROOM FOR WATER TO RUN.		I HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE, BUT THIS IS REALLY PRETTY AND IF YOU HAVE AN ENTRYWAY THAT WILL TOLERATE IT, OR ARE WILLING TO SLIT THE BOTTOM, THEN ITS A GOER. IT LOOKS REALLY NICE AROUND THE MAGNET MATE DOOR MATS. I RECOMMEND THEM BOTH UNDER PROPER CONDITIONS.
0,This is a must if you are trying to remove metal staining from your pool.  Works very well combined with the stain remover made by the same company.
0,We live in the Pacific Northwest, where slugs and snails are just part of the scenery. Try growing a hosta plant here with no protection from these critters, and you will soon find that all you did was provide a big delicious salad for slugs.		It is actually quite easy to protect plants from slugs and snails, but you must be vigilant. (They just laugh at those dishes of beer you set out for them overnight.)  Sprinkle some around each and every plant and seedling throughout the entire growing season, most importantly in early spring.		We've used several brands of slug-death, but this Ortho brand stands out in that it stays solid even after a rain, and thus continues to be deadly for a longer period of time.		Ortho is a well known brand, and you can trust that this slug and snail killer will do the job, when used correctly.
0,Nice quality for the price
0,Does what it needs to.
0,Packaged well, shipped quickly, works as described.
0,Everything you need except plants
0,excellent
0,arrived in a timely fashion as described. Can't wait to start my seeds.
0,works as described.  very happy with these.
0,Now that is a handy device! We had to put all our tools into a storage unit, but now we can use them over there!
0,Looks like a good cover fit is perfect.
0,Just installed a vinyl fence and realized we had over looked how we would hang all our pool tools up out of the way. This is the perfect solution. These hooks just clip over the top of the fence without any tools.
0,This really helps especially for plants susceptible to fungal diseases.
0,Really like this entry-level smoker. Plenty big for the beginner.  Lots of nice features.  Add the external smoker box and it's quite a combo.  I bolted both to a cart on wheels to roll it in and out of the garage.  Highly recommend.
0,These were brought for my mother, she uses these to catch	little crawlies, occasionally water bugs or a roach.	I do not think she has caught a mouse though.
0,Set trap one day and the next day it caught a mole.  Watched for more tunnels and the next time I set it I caught one in two days.  Great trap..
0,Works great but always expensive (my 4th in 25 years)
0,Great product!
0,I got tired of wrestling the normal rubber garden hoses and decided to just try this out. I'm glad I did. These are much easier to work with and to store versus rubber hoses.
0,Came with tiny rip in top of canvas, too much trouble to box back up and send back. Used a piece of reflective tape and its as good as new.
0,Happy!  Happy!  Happy!
0,These work for their intended use they are not very sturdy or stron would not hold down any heavy items but work for weed barrier in garden.
0,Excellent purchase
0,I live on a lake with 4 acres of trees.  Trimming up low hanging branches, and cleaning up after wind or storms has been a pain with my regular chain saw.  You know the drill, get it out, mix the gas/oil, get it started, get the ladder... climb up, and try to be careful with that chainsaw over your head... or reaching.  NO MORE.  The B&D pole saw is not perfect, but is perfect in many ways.		Pros: Light weight, great pole extension length, easy connect for multiple pole sections, very nice storage bag, and quiet.  It comes with a top notch charger too.  Great for branches and limbs.		Cons: Battery life is not what I had hoped for... but it's working fine for me.  You should be able to work for 20-30 minutes trimming branches and limbs... but it you start running it continuously to cut 6" stuff into pieces, you'll find yourself with no power in about 10 minutes.  If you have a lot to cut... buy an extra battery.		You won't be sorry you bought this tool.  I could only find it on Amazon.  Menards, Lowes, and Home Depot only carried the older lower voltage versions.
0,The rack is pretty good, made out of much heavier stainless steel than really needed to hold peppers. The coring tool is the key to making peppers people can eat and this one works great. The only problem I've had with this rack is that all the holes are the same size while all your peppers are probably different. With a bit of practice you can pick the right size peppers for the rack but a variety of hole sizes in the rack would work better. Be sure to put a cookie sheet or other tray underneath it as the peppers will inevitably fall over and spill, and I've even had them soften / shrink in the oven and fall right through the rack to the bottom of the oven!	My peppers:	-- Dip in olive oil then salt peppers after coring.	-- Filling is 1/2 shredded cheddar and 1/2 cream cheese with ground up bacon bits from food processor. Nuke and mix. Put this filling in a baggie (the 100 calorie ones work best) and seal, then cut off a corner so you can squirt it down into the peppers.	-- Roast about 20 mins at 425. Keep an eye on it the first couple times, the peppers will not behave unless they're seated just right!
0,Sturdy construction. Woodpeckers do seem to like it. No complaints from me
0,Great mixture of a shovel and a hatchet/small axe. Very sharp and can really take a beating.
0,Talk about a good deal.  Now you never have to go without a primer bulb again.
0,Nice quality. I placed them in the cemetary but was disappointed someone broke one off the plastic peg that sticks in the ground. They do look nice and work good
0,Looks great in the yard over our picnic table. The only thing I would ask for is that it have a crank to open. Pushing it up is a pain in the neck but once up, it looks awesome.
0,Works ok
0,this cute well constructed little bucket is just that. well constructed and little. When marketed as 1 gallon bucket, i assumed the same volume as a 1 gallon jug of milk. i haven't tested this statement, but i don't think a gallon of milk would fit in this bucket, much less in the inner lining bucket. None the less it is well made, keeps the odor shut in tight due to the sealed lid, and is cute in design. I just have to make 2-4 trips a day out to the compost bin as i compost everything aside from human waste.
0,This one i will buy again, the search is over, I had plants in a week, No mess. I like the way the soil is netted for a clean transfer , no mess.
0,Just what I needed!
0,good easy to read
0,Great coffee again with a lot less expense.. Each is individually wrapped. I felt confident using the product and will order again!
0,Works well, worth the money
0,I pot up from four to six inch net pots, have to ware more and use saucers under them but never have to worry about over watering. I don't use them in hydroponics.
0,Works great! Pool sparkles
0,better that the old one.
0,Two years ago, I purchased an old building and was renovating it for use as a store.  As we were in the construction phase, we saw some signs of bats, but had no clue as to the severity of the problem until we put in our video surveillance system and I checked out the recordings from the previous night... I expected that there had to be a DJ someplace around, because THEY WERE HAVING A BAT PARTY!!!  At that point I was very concerned.  We had three weeks until the shop was supposed to open, and I didn't know what to do.  Bats are protected, and they are also beneficial, but they couldn't stay in the shop as it is a significant deterrent to business  :)  I didn't care if they were outside because I don't like all of the mosquitoes, but bats are not welcome inside.  I couldn't afford to spend huge amounts of money on an exterminator with the slim hope that it would work in such a short period of time.  I was under the impression that a single unit would cover 5,000 square feet and our building is 4,200 square feet.  Not wanting to take a chance, I purchased three of them!!!  I set them all to variable frequencies and plugged them in throughout the shop.  This resulted in immediate success!  I have checked the 'middle of the night activity' countless times on my security cameras during the past two years and I can say that I am totally pleased.  NO MORE BATS (or bat parties)!!!  I know that this is not what the instructions told me to do, but I wasn't going to take a chance with such a short period of time and no opportunity for 'do overs'.  Periodically, I loan out one of my units to people that complain about bat activity to let them see if it works for them.  In every case, it has worked for them (but I got my units back, because I like the fact that I still don't have bats).
0,Well Made
0,We bought these hoses from the Xhose website and were skeptical, but took the chance.  They work very well and we have two 50 footers at our house in Centennial, CO and two 50 Footers are our Ranch Property in Como, CO.  There are two things that I would caution you on.  The first is they have plastic fittings and we are not sure how long they will last, but they seem to be pretty rugged, but with all plastic I get concerned.  The second is that the outer webbing sheath is an attraction to dogs who like to chew and to birds or rodents that want to make a nest.  The dog problem is one at our home in Centennial because they are in the backyard running around, so we just roll it up when we are done using the hoses.  The birds or rodent problem is one of our ranch problems, so we roll it up.  They are so easy to roll up then we store them in buckets in the house or garage, but if you are going to have unsupervised access to these hoses by animals you might find them chewed up.  These are the only problems that I could see with these hoses.  However, I would buy them from the actually website as you get a better deal, but will have to wait about 2 plus weeks to get them.
0,This idler pulley is much better than the original pulley that came on my CubCadet RZT 54 ,I'm quite pleased .
0,This is a really easy solution to hanging several grill tools off a Weber grill.  Fits good and it's a very inexpensive way to stay organized while grilling.
0,This planter is a great way to save space & can be used indoors or outdoors. It comes with a sturdy chain for hanging it & allows for drip tray to be snapped on to the bottom whether you are hanging it or setting it on a flat surface. Allows for planting 6 plants below top planter & you can easily plant  1 to 4 more plants on top. Perhaps even more depending on what types of plants you are growing. For instance I will be using the top planter for 4 different types of leaf style lettuce like Romaine & Bib, More lettuce will be planted in center planter and I will be planting herbs like thyme & oregano in bottom that will cascade downwards as they grow. This will be for hanging the entire planter. I bought 2 sets, so may add up to 2 more layers. 5 is limit for hanging with chain provided & because of weight bottom planter will be supporting when suspending. You can stack more if you run small PVC pipe or dowel thru center to stabilize & keep it from tipping over when placing on flat surface or stacking on pole off the ground with a stop put in place on pipe that will stop planter from sliding down the pole. Great way to help keep small animals from eating harvest and easier on the back because it is at a better height for you.  I will be running small PVC pipe thru hanging basket just to give it better support but with just a set of three it is really sturdy enough on its own. Pictures below are of planter straight out of box. I may post more pictures after it is filled & growing.
0,good table with height adjust
0,excellent  product	strong Light and effective	Highly recommend!!!
0,Great purchase and value over any box store will buy again!
0,I tried this spot cleaner today and followed the instructions that came with it. Used it to treat calcium scale on a plaster/gunite pool bottom. The scale spots I have on hand are particularly unsightly because their accumulation coincided with an algae problem so it trapped a lot algae-induced greenish-yellowish color within. The tool WORKS. I am very happy with it. It does what it says it would meaning that it releases acid slowly to treat the spot. One load of acid lasts about 10 minutes and is sufficient to clean roughly 1 sq ft.		I don't think the tool would work well on pool walls because the acid is heavier than water and would tend to move down and away from the vertical surface. But on horizontal surfaces such as a pool bottom this tool works fine.		Now, the only thing I wish I could change about it is the pad size. I would use a larger container, or a tool with 2,3,4 or more containers and a much larger pad, so that it would clean a bigger area faster. As it is, it is great for treating small spots (palm size spots). But if you set out to treat an area of 20-30 square feet as I need to do, then it would take days. I wish I could somehow tie 3 or 4 of these things together to use simultaneously.
0,I thought all floater dispensers were the same.  Well, this one works MUCH better than the one I had before.  Water is crystal clear and this thing somehow has good water flow through to the chlorine tablets inside.  I left the sticker on lol.
0,no issues, plants grew and produced
0,Lifesaver for humans that hate bugs!!!
0,Easy to use and hold ites securely with no spinning. Makes kebab easy.
0,I love this.  It is very cool and makes my garden look much neater w the hose rolled up on it. Seem solid and well made.
0,Very pleased.
0,Heavy duty and high quality.
0,Glad I purchased it. I recommend it!
0,My previous rechargeable  trimmer does not hold the charge too long.  This one is light, very handy, yet the charge lasts longer than the other product. Gives me more area to do the trimming.
0,Great once you can get them in the ground.  Solar collector has limited positioning.  Repositioning entire unit may be required as seasons change.
0,There trimming shears are fantastic!
0,love this jaw
0,Work great
0,Had it for 1 full season and had no problems. It is brighter than any solar or battery operated option.
0,do what they need to do, but u can get 3 of the gorilla grow ones for same price..
0,We started with 3 chaise lounges and 2 side tables and immediately purchased these covers through Amazon based on their reviews. They were a perfect fit and they hold up well through sun, wind and rain. Over the past few years we have expanded our patio and have over 20 pieces of furniture in need of being covered. This is still our #1 go to.  These covers will definitely prolong the life of our beautiful patio furniture. Love them!
0,If you have long rows of flowers or shrubs this is idea for covering them during freezing weather.  Did a great job!
0,The pulley did fit perfect and is of good quality. I would purchase again...but hope I won't need to. ;)
0,Installed in pool skimmer
0,No more ladders
0,Normally I try to only use non-toxic, organic happy type of garden products but having a pretty serious allergy to fire ants means serious business. Because my allergies are literally life threatening, fire ants are more than a nuisance so I need something that really works. I've been buying this product for years and it does the job right - unlike lesser products (and I've tried oodles of organic and other items) this doesn't just make the mound move...it kills it all off.  Effective and while not healthy, it's a lot better than the alternative.
0,Great hose...soo tired of pulling on the heavier hose.
0,Great for your backyard pond
0,This is a great setup for monitoring meat temperature. Wouldn't go without it.
0,Works as described.
0,GREAT flag, we use when camping out of the state to show our pride!  Our only issue was while it was in the storage bag it got wet and the red faded into the white a little.  Luckily I caught it quickly and it didn't completely ruin it
0,I live on 3 acres in a semi-rural area where weeds are an annual battle.  Have been using this product for 5 summers along long fence line and a few other places.  Results seem slow... sometimes about 2 weeks before visible, but gets the job done.  (One reviewer mentioned other glyphosate products also include a defoliant so that the consumer "sees results" quickly, but this product apparently does not.) Even kills yucca!... because of its waxy, heavy leaves yucca takes longer... and a spreader-sticker should definitely be used. Yucca often grow in patches or form lines as they spread via runners under the ground surface, so digging out rids them only temporarily.  Spray with glyphosate/spreader-sticker... it will kill some of the root system and be much less likely to return.  Good price now, too.  RECOMMENDED!
0,Held up well for the Blizzard of  2016 Jonas that hit Maryland! Makes shoveling not so complicated!
0,Bought this for my dad and he now uses it every day in his garden. He loves it!
0,These panels are efficient and light with great build quality. They even make power when parked under a sodium vapor street light!
0,It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena
0,Bought 2, one for our son and one for us - works great.  Pretty complex assembly but my daughter and wife helped (really better with 2 or more people)
0,Good stuff, keeps the ticks off
0,Great posts.  These are strong and well made.  I've used and reused them.  Can be easily inserted into the earth and removed.  With a little care they will last a long time.
0,Very cool net for shallow bodies of water and surface skimming.
0,This item works. No batteries required! It's sturdy and well made. I practiced and turned out five or six seed pots of varying heights. But I got my quality control down pat with practice and recently made six dozen of these for a gardening friend. It didn't take long at all. She was thrilled, because the newspaper not only holds the moisture and is a perfect environment for seeds, it adds valuable materials to the soil after planting. And it reuses material that often goes into a landfill. A great purchase!
0,This has a drawstring so it was perfect to cover up our fire pit.  It is also nice canvas waterproof material so it's durable.
0,I ordered these for a recent party and they work well and are pretty sturdy. I thought they would be a little bigger but still were very functional for the party. I ended up using a few for fruits and veggies since I ran out of other dishes and didn't need anymore drip pans.
0,nice variety of annual flowers
0,This is large. it says Supersize and it is. It also appears to be made from a good quality that will put up a good fight against the effects of chlorine for some time. It floats nicely. Some seem to sink with the weight of a few chlorine tabs. I like how the top locks on in a bayonet fashion and you know it is locked when you hear and feel the click. There is a tab on the side with a hole which is very useful for me in keeping the tablet dispenser from finding its way to the front of the skimmer. I have it tied to the opposite side of the pool. The opening on the bottom seem small to me at first but I think that is because the dispenser is supersized. After using it, I do not think it would work as well if the openings were larger.
0,Seems to be of good quality having a little problem with the electric igniter maybe it's just a low battery but I could not get it till late last night when I tried to barbecue so I had to use a match  cooks  really good though really love the flavor that I get and it seems to be just right for cooking a few steaks
0,gift .. she loved it
0,First I wuld like to say that I got these seeds at a promotional price in return of my unbiased review. I got my seeds today and I am so excited to sow them on the ground by the end of this month. I am making a fall veggie garden and these veggie seeds are perfect! I really like that on the back of each packet, it tells a little about the vegetable. And it also tells you how much sun it needs, how deep to sow, how far apart to plant them and in how many days is it ready for harvest. They also have a free online class where you can go and  watch videos on how to plant, care and harvest and can also download pdf files.		The plastic smoothie cup that came with it is also neat. I will be able to make my own green/fruit juice and use the cup. I will definitely update and post photos once my seeds starts sprouting and once they mature.		Update: 8/7/15- seeds are on the ground. Cant wait to see them sprout!	Update:  8/17/15- seeds are sprouting!!! Will post pics once they are bit taller. So happy!		10/5/15: We harvested bunches of kale! Yum!!		03/02/2016- the kales are doing great as ever. We dug all of them up and replanted them back in the garden bed and they survived! we will probably have kales through summer! The lettuces are bigger now too. I did not have any luck with spinach. Collards were great and the one and only swiss chard that grew is still struggling to make it.		Overall, I realize that if you are new to growing veggies, to always do your research on how to plant seeds. Poor to no germination can be because of lack of knowledge on how to sow seeds properly. These seeds are great seeds. I will buy again in the future.
0,Lightning speed delivery, competitive price and fantastic product installation instructions when the written and on-line YouTube tutorials combined. I was unable to buy the required components locally due to a widespread long term outage. Had I been able to purchase them locally I'd have paid about $100.000 more for all I needed.  One word of caution- if your generator has a  "Neutral Bonded to Frame" sticker at the bottom of the outlet panel you will trip the GFI breaker.  For Honda you may bring the unit into the dealer and they can remove the wire. Or if you are somewhat familiar with taking things apart you can find the Service bulletin #20 and it shows how to access and remove the wire....and how to re-label it for safety on the job site. It won't be OSHA compliant without the neutral bond to ground. I saved mine and zip tied it to the frame for safe keeping.
0,Adjust the lo mixture for highest RPM's at idle and hi mixture for highest RPM's at full-throttle. Adjust the idle just until the chain stops. Amazon has parts in bulk. Repair Clinic and E Replacement Parts are GREAT sources for parts. E Replacement Parts has exploded views.
0,Good hose
0,This one was easy to use right out of the box, as I just had to open the packaging and place the trap.  It did take almost a month of trying, but we finally caught our first mouse recently and I was able to dispose of it before we started getting the death stench.  Setting the trap was quite easy, similar to what you do with the old-fashioned ones.		The trap obviously works, and the removal of the mouse was easy.  I would point out that while you don't see the mouse initially, you're likley going to see it when you dispose of it unless you're willing to pay the premium of a new trap for each catch.  It's a good choice for those who don't want to avoid the eyesore of the old-school traps, although those old ones are likely just as effective.
0,Awesome set of shepherds hooks!  Glossy black,  sturdy and a great price.
0,FIVE STARS DUE TO LOW PRICE POINT	THIS does NOT compare to an equivalent sized Stihl or Husqvanra.	Purchased this chainsaw after losing my dad's 1980s commercial grade Stihl.  I also lost my brand new (3 yrs old) Husqvarna in the same failed tail gate event.  Dad's almost 80, so I don't expect him to be using a chainsaw for another decade.  I selected this saw because it looked like a good value, priced under one hundred and thirty dollars.		Pros:	*Comes complete and pretty clean (exhaust looks oxidized / used and there were a few wood chips in with the air filter)	*The bar was far better quality and heft than I'd expected!	*Chain is moderately heavy and sharp out of the box (Bar and Chain hadn't been used on my unit).	*VERY LIGHT WEIGHT  - Dad's had both shoulders replaced, so this is a big plus.	*After initial start, it would start on the first easy pull.	*Nice bar length	*Tip protector isn't nearly as annoying as I'd thought it would be	*Quiet by comparison to any other chainsaw I've used.	*Nice step by step instruction sticker on the bottom of the handle - no reason my husband shouldn't be able to figure out how to start it cold.	*Nice rocker switch to kill/stop		Cons:	*The vibration reduction handle fits poorly with the body (design flaw) but this doesn't impact use.	*The balance point is a little forward due to the light plastic body construction and the heavy, quality bar.  This caused me some fatigue, but I'm sure if I used it a few weekends in a row I'd adjust to it.	*Quiet motor makes it sound wimpy. GOOD for my ears, just don't forget to take it seriously!	*The light weight plastic housing will not last under heavy use.  Dad wouldn't have gotten two years use out of this if he was still in his sixties. *Air-filter cover will break off first, after having another saw slam into it in the trunk or on the wood pile.	*Bar Oil cap retainer seems to fall across the opening so the oil builds on it, capping the opening and running over.  This may not be such an issue in warmer weather when the oil isn't as thick. I'll use a funnel next time, but that's one more thing to remember, and one more item that might get left out in the field.		I am very impressed with this saw in relation to the price point.  I've only taken it out for a spin once, but it dropped a 26" diameter live Red Oak with ease, cutting it like it was pine.  After the tree dropped, I managed to pull my back and I handed it off to a twenty something to finish cleaning the brush off the crown and cutting the limbs into firewood length pieces. The blade didn't need a touch-up after this (less than a tank of gas).		Minor Update - Used it this weekend in cold/wet conditions.  There was about a foot of snow on the ground and it was almost impossible to make a cut without going through some ice/snow.  The tip guard seemed to play some role in icing up and the chain would get pulled off the bar and jam up at the tip. I'm not going to take any stars off because the weather was funky (it's been well below zero for a few weeks, it was the first "warm" day up in the high twenties).  If this problem continues I'll come back and comment.  Otherwise this saw has been starting on the first pull after the initial start.  It's been running well in very cold conditions - the cap keeper is still driving me nuts on the stupid bar oil tank.
0,The umbrella arrived with no assembly hardware (the required 4 bolts & washers to assemble the base,  and no tension knobs to keep the umbrella from swinging sideways). Also, no assembly instructions (pretty simple - probably not needed -  but I wonder if this was a return and they left out the assembly hardware). I can't find a way to contact the vendor directly to see what they can do. I hate to have to return the item for lack of a few bolts! If the hardware were included, I would rate this a 5 star.
0,Great product, love it !
0,love it
0,Strong and easy to use.
0,This is a nice-looking, well-built hummingbird feeder. It's all glass and metal, no cheap plastic construction. It looks elegant and will last a long time. The included free nectar solution is only good for 8 ounces, but it's still a nice bonus.
0,Love this simple and works
0,After purchasing a 5lb container of Miracle Grow plant food and filling a big plant waterer by measuring scoop at a time, I saw this sprayer unit's picture on the back of the plant food's container so got it.  Not only did it make using it to fill the watering container with the right amount of plant food & water mix much easier & faster, just having this sprayer attachment alone to disperse plant food helped save all of the plants in the yard that were badly damaged by a severe late-spring major hailstorm.  Will never be without an attachment like this again!!!
0,The humming birds like it like to watch them they will fight & run each other off. They don't like to share.
0,Fits my Mini Baja MB200 / Baja Warrior mini bike perfectly! Better made than the previous OEM version, a bit thicker and not as warped. I was pleasantly surprise to find the valve cover breather tube attached and an air filter inside as well. Now my mini baja runs again!! I forgot how awesome the mini baja is, thanks for the cheap air intake!
0,This was very easy to set up.  I expect it will be easy to raise as my flowers grow
0,Excellent flag, quality in all respects
0,Fast delivery, does the job well!
0,Helps keep food dry and allows for a place of refuge during rain.  Our feathery friends seem to enjoy the dome and the squirrels have a hard time getting to the feeder which we all like.  Ordered two of these and very pleased.
0,Perfect size to the Q1000 grill
0,works great to help get rid of foam that sometimes builds up
0,Wonderful packaging and wonderful little seeds! Planted them and enjoyed them quite a bit :)
0,Have had one of these for many years. Love it, does not leak around hose attachment, and adjustments for water pattern are easily achieved. Stays in place with no tipping over when water pressure changes or is adjusted.
0,almost too bright.
0,I've wanted this AeroGarden for over a year now.  Kept holding off since it cost so much.  Amazon had a great sale on this and I had a gift cert too so I decided to splurge.  It was super-easy to set up.  Got the herb garden kit with it so I'm anxious to see it grow. I'll keep you posted as to results.
0,Great Price!	Fast Shipping!	Came in just the nick of time.  Looking forward to this helping to keep the ice drift from building up.
0,This fly trap is a necessity for me because I have two dogs and a big fenced in yard. I use a doggie door and the dogs can come and go at will. Of course they do their business out in the yard. If I didn't have this fly trap, I'd really have a fly problem.	I use two of the bags at once on either side of the fence. Using picture hanging wire, the bags are easy to hang and flies are absolutely attracted to the odor of the chemical inside the bag. The bag lasts for quite a time. Just a warning; when you have to take d	the bag down, carefully drop the bag into a large garbage bag. The odor of the chemical inside the bag in unpleasant and I hang the bags a distance from the house. I recommend this fly trap.
0,anyone with a pond needs this product
0,I haven't had one of these for a few years, but this one feels as good as the ones we've had in the past.  It was some inches longer than specified and that's good because there was not a standard size that would fit my pool.  I could have used a couple of feet more length, but this one covers enough of the water to save big on evaporation and chemicals.  And, it's a manageable size.  In years past when I had one that fit the pool well, getting it in and out was difficult. Not so this slightly smaller one.
0,As described- will fit my chainsaw
0,Thak you saved me from having to buy a new rider
0,Just started using it so I don't have a good feel for the results yet.
0,Works well!
0,Worked perfectly
0,I like the fact that this is not bulky and heavy. It does not leak at all and works well. Does not tangle and is flexible. No complaints...
0,works great and meat taste better with wood chips hands down.
0,Works very well. Use this, along with 4 airstones, to make compost tea.
0,I tired of my weak little hose sprayers and decided to pay a little more money and see if it would make a difference. I purchased this one and a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bon-Aire-Original-Ultimate-Hose-Nozzle-Aluminum-with-Soft-Grip-Handle/dp/B002HLCZSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bon-Aire Original Ultimate Hose Nozzle (Aluminum) with Soft Grip Handle</a>. This one feels robust, is built well and can really put out a good blast of water so it's good for cleaning and water blasting. But what it does not do as well as the Bon-Aire is put out a lot of water at a slower velocity. If I'm watering trees or bushes, this one gives me a little too much pressure but if you're mainly going to use it for cleaning and blasting, it's just fine and costs less than the Bonaire.
0,These tables fold easily for storage and make excellent side tables for the patio. They do have to be cleaned and oiled from time to time. Stable and roomy.
0,good quality I recommend!
0,Fits like a glove , holds up to Las Vegas Sun ,which destroys everything
0,Fantastic tool to put the water where you want it.
0,They ate the whole bag! It definitely slows them down cause my weinie dogs can catch them. And i found one dried up! Bought a 2nd bag.
0,Just the perfect watering can when plastic won't do.  Quality abounds from this extremely well constructed can.
0,as described...
0,Works great. One small part broke but the lamp is still able to be elevated or lowered as needed
0,Good fertilizers
0,The wild turkeys quickly learned to avoid the patch of recently-sown grass seed.	UPDATE:  Used it to keep a skunk away from my little pond, after it had eaten half the goldfish, and it worked really well.
0,I like it!  I think the design is great and they look well made.  I would buy again.
0,I order this because the top bushing had worn out and let the drive gears disconnect from the motor which meant my garge door didn't go up and down anymore.  I called a repair company who wanted over $250 to come fix it.  I was pleasantly surprise to find that repair kit available on Amazon.  It had everything I needed to repair my garage door, including easy to follow directions.  I replaced my worn-out one in about 2 hours and now my opener is a good as new.  Saved my over $200, a great bargain.
0,Didnt fit my saw but it was easy to drill another hole to make it fit. I think you could get it to fit any pole saw with a little creativity.
0,met my expectations
0,I have bought Funky Flames before and it was super disappointing.  From now on I am only buying Mystical Fire Extreme's packets, the colors were vivid and lasted quite some time.  You will see green, blue, purple, and I even saw some dark red.
0,Excellent Cover. Very sturdy. We owned several of this covers and they 're all very well made. Not the cheap kind you buy at box stores. The quality and weight of it is great. It drapes well over my chair.	I have tried others that are more flimsy but this is a way better cover that has	the stain or splash protector at the bottom. Buckle straps for the legs to hold it in place.		It cover my chair almost to the floor and it snugged so that the wind would not	blow it away. The fabric is supposed to protect against mold and mildew. We live in the south so this helps. I think time will tell for	now it is a great cover for the winter for our outdoor furniture.
0,Wonderful chair cover. Very sturdy even in strong winds here in Fl.
0,This is an easy to assemble and lightweight hammock stand. It's exactly what I'd hoped for. Very nice and simple design.
0,My knees are totally protected with this one. It's fabulously thick.
0,Good value.
0,This is a remarkable product - looks very nice and is extremely easy to put into place.  We used it on a flowerbed between the house and the sidewalk alongside the house.  It fit very nicely along the curvature of the sidewalk (curves in a sharp "C" shape in a couple of places).  We used only 3 of the Terrace Board Stakes per 20' so that was a plus as well.  It does arrive tightly coiled, but a day or so relaxing on the living room floor is all that is necessary for manueverability.
0,This is a fine trap as long as the mole uses the same tunnel. It did trap (kill) the critter so I must give 5 stars because it works. Also, try the worm style poison sold in some shops, it seems to work as well. If someone comes up with a good Vole killer, please advise.
0,Love Her :)
0,Using this to grow lettuce on the deck. Nice!
0,As described
0,Use on my propane space heater. Gets tank further away and easy to change tanks.
0,This makes it Easier to get those nasty flys. It makes it more fun too. This thing is way better than the 5.00$ ones at Harbor freight
0,Perfect fit, installed and doing what it's supposed to do !  Make sure you follow the torque recommendations for the screws as it is easy to strip the threads out of the aluminum housing.
0,Very good product!
0,The plant was much larger than those of other nurseries, and healthier despite having been shipped. It was also well-packed to prevent damage.	I immediately transplanted into a nice pot and put it into a south-facing window and while I don't have any buds yet -- the new green growth is quite stunning.	Treat it much like you would a gardenia with acidic water and full indoor sun. Better yet, place it outside if it's not burning up hot.		Thank you, Hirt's!
0,Very good quality, fits my chargriller just as they said it would
0,We go shooting at a local small range. There are no counters, tables or chairs. This folding table adjusts to counter height. Great take along.
0,I didn't know how many creepy crawly bugs I had in the basement until I put some of these down.  Since then I've put them in the back of my kitchen cabinets.  It really bothers me to see one of those thousand-leggers float across the floor.  It's not that I hate bugs, I don't.  But they belong outside and not inside my house, near my food or near my family.  I make these into boxes so that I don't have to see the whole story of the stuck bug(s).  I can then toss the entire thing in the garbage, say a few kind words and then take it all out to the big can outside.
0,Nicely made, delivered on time, in great condition and I didn't need poultry shears to open it !
0,Simple and works as expected
0,Works perfectly.  We kind of abused it in the first few days without realizing it, as it was clogged with leaves and debris, but it kept right on doing its thing.  The pump was fine, but the pond looked an ugly sort of brown.  We dredged out the koi pond and it's never looked better.  Would definitely buy this product again.
0,This is my second one of these . Pro's they are quiet , use less electricity then a magnetic ballast as well as can tell and self switch between MH and HPS bulbs that are the correct size or 600 watts lighting either one . They also have 3 power settings or a dimmer switch . They come with a 5 year warranty in fact I am looking for my paperwork now as I had one burn out after 3 years of daily use .  The first thing you check is the fuse and there are videos on youtube on how to do it . All you need is a flat blade screw driver their is a little drawer built in by where the power chord plugs in . You just put the flat end tip in where it fits together and pry it open ...very simple .  Inside is a extra fuse they both slide out in the piece that is the drawer . You just switch the two and put it back together . The video says 50% of the time this fixes the lamp . In my case I found a bulb burned out so I replaced the bulb and still nothing where upon I changed the fuse without luck so I purchased this as they are very affordable as ballasts go. The setup lit up and works great now . In my case the 2 day prime shipping was a huge draw and worth the small premium to the best deal I could find anywhere online or local . I used the warehouse deals to save a little more money and nothing but the packaging was effected , just a crushed box . With the expense of shipping these warranties are so so as well as  you don't have the time if you have plants to wait for the process to take place . I expect to see a drop in my electric use . Amazon says the warehouse deals do not have a warranty I will still register it and check with Ipower . The ballast was never used it was all wrapped in plastic with all the warranty papers only the crushed packaging . All and all I am very pleased though sad the original only lasted 3 years so I took a star off . I believe the capacitor or igniter went out . If initial cost is a consideration this is a solid choice and I found for my needs 600 watts with a dimmable ballast was the best choice though most prefer 1000 watts and the 400 is the least expensive there is plenty of information online to help choose the proper wattage for your application .
0,Seeds sprouted up nicely despite not having perfect weather conditions. I made sure I wet down the area well and covered with plastic to keep them moist while under the sun and then protected from the sudden cold that showed up; and they all sprouted up and are growing and thriving. I signed up with the company's website and received a coupon for 20% off ground covers and I am so impressed with this seed that I went ahead and purchased another 5 lbs. I have quite of bit of area I want to cover with this. I also checked on other mini clovers out there, Outside Pride has the most affordable seed.
0,Cheap and effective, saved me a ton of money this year on chlorine.
0,I can't really tell if this worked or not. I pulled the head from my sand filter and ran a garden hose down through the sand to loosen the debris. A bunch of junk and murky water came out of it in this process. Once finished I added the cleaner and had the water set about 1" above the sand overnight. The next day I flushed it again with the hose and then back washed it for several minutes.		Yes the overall pressure did drop once finished but I don't know if it was the garden hose cleaning or the chemical that caused this. Maybe both? Either way something worked and the cost is not high so its worth a try.
0,Love this sail and the shade it provides on our deck. And will take it down for the winter.
0,Works great for seedlings or even as a secondary panel for vegging.
0,If you know what you are doing this is the best stuff for getting rid of all the little kids peeing in your pool.  Every time I have my kids friends come over I put 2.5 pounds of this stuff in the pool and set the pump to recirculate.  After about a day of my pool looking like a huge white cloud it all settles to the bottom of the pool like lard and you suck it up.  Just be ready to backwash 2 to 3 times because your filter will clog up quick with this stuff.  I have a sand filter and after I do the treatment to the pool it is crystal clear at night with the light no more cloudy at nigh clear by day.		The pool retail shops will try to sell you all kinds of other products that slowly clear all of your couldiness, but trust me if you need to clear your pool in a hurry just set it to recirculate wait a day and vacuum it up.  Backwash frequently since it will clog your filter quick and you are done.		Great stuff, this is all I ever use when we have big pool parties.
0,Instructions were to mail it to one address but the lady bugs were left in the mailbox? Luckily they survived the heat of the day. Awesome to see them all fly away. We used them for a birthday party and the kids love it.
0,I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned, the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times, I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though, I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!
0,These loppers can really cut through large branches and thick saplings.		 I'm super impressed with them - they get an hour or two workout each weekend.		Two problems:	 - both foam rubber handles have ripped so I've had to wrap them up with rubberized tape	- the plastic pieces where the fiberglass handles attach to the blade area have really sharp edges and they will cut up your hands while you are carrying the loppers.  I grounded the edges down and also wrapped that area with the rubber tape so my hands no longer get all scuffed up.		Other than those minor items I think that this is a really great product.  Keep the blade sharp, the mechanism oiled, and occasionally tighten the nuts and these will be a great investment.
0,Love this beautiful fall garden flag! Two sided, wonderful colors and well made!
0,Very pleased
0,8> Thank You $$$ 8> :D ^^
0,Nice bulb
0,Better than expected. Entire family enjoyed looking at it and couldn't believe "young or that on Amazon?".  Reviews I read were correct when said good quality. Each length of 'discs' were attached but wrapped and sealed individually in clear plastic so they wouldn't tangle. I wasn't sure what sound it would make, besides clanging noise but actually makes beautiful music wind chime sound.
0,Saved my hose. Fits standard size hoses. Don't think it's real brass.
0,Works great
0,Bought myself an organic EarthBox to fit into my limited size backyard. I now have a huge and thriving full box consisting of one giant grape tomato plant, one poblano pepper plant and smaller basil and parsley. The yields on the tomato and pepper will be amazing. Highly recommended for simplicity and success.
0,This the best way I have found to do fish on the grill.  WIih the fish being "trapped" between the two grates, it is so easy to flip with no worries about breaking the fish apart.  Just remember to spreay both food contact surfaces with a non-stick oil spreay.
0,Fits and does the job
0,Quick delivery, great price, and look adoreable in my garden
0,I can't say enough about Evergreen Applique flags.  These flags are so well made and durable.  Be sure and get the "stoppers" to keep the flag from slipping off of the shepherds hook when it's windy.  You don't want these to blow away
0,Great product.
0,These are perfect replacements and so far these are durable as well.
0,Great Item.  The key is to know which one you need for your particular BBQ Grill. You DON"T want to use the steel brush on a cast Iron grill that has been coated to protect it from rust, like the Weber "Q" Series. You will ruin that coating in no time at all. The Brass works Great and the steel works great. I would Buy again.
0,Was a little skeptical after I received it, seemed too lightweight and too thin, but to my surprise it works great, keeps the water off the lounger even when there is puddles on it, and stays put during high winds.
0,Great design and really cute.  It is probably the best watering can I have ever had.  There are two holes on the top making filling it very easy.  The spout gives pinpoint watering capabilities which is great for bushy house plants or those where it's hard to get to the soil.
0,Bought this last Fall.  It's been in the box until Memorial Weekend.  Putting it together was medium difficult. But the end results are great.	It's a nice addition to the backyard as a potting bench, bar, etc...I just had to have it.  I would buy again.  Hose it off.  Nothing to rust.  Bad thing is:. Grass clippings stick to it like glue!  Don't cut the grass by it! Lol
0,my hummers have enjoyed it.
0,I love the classic hickory flavor this wood infuses in the meat! We use this on our gas grill when grilling to add a smoky flavor, and it works great!!
0,GROWING AS PROMISED.  SENT TOMATO SEEDS AND THEY ARE GROWING TOO
0,Shelled sunflower seeds are CHEAPER per pound of feed than seeds in the shell and they leave no mess or wild sunflower plants in the yard.	A secret for bird feeders in snow country, put out chicken grit (oyster shell) in the winter and your bird feed will last much longer since the birds can utilize the feed much better.
0,The Pondmaster 20W UV sterilizer is an excellent product that does exactly what it is advertised to do.  We have a 200gal water feature with seven large (10 inch) gold fish that was so filled with suspended algae we could not see the fish except when they came up at feeding time.  We installed the 2920 along with a temporary micro-fiber filter and in one day the water was crystal clear.  The micro-fiber filter was then removed and the 2920 has kept the water perfectly clear.  It's now been six weeks since the installation and we are completely satisfied with the 2920 and would recommend it to anyone who is having difficulty with cloudy water in their fish pond.
0,the item came quick and it is great for planting and garden plants,ty
0,Very efficient and quiet pool pump.  I actually have to go over to it to see if it is running it is so quiet.  Only had it a few weeks so waiting to see the cost savings on utility bill.
0,I am real happy with the product.  The price was right and it does exactly what I need for my backyard pool.
0,This appears to be very well made.  It will be interesting to see if it out lives it's appearance.  Cause once it looks bad...no matter it's condition ....it's gone. Same with the users of said product...just kidding.	2015....it's in the landfill....mold.
0,Waiting fo spring to hang outside.
0,I have had my iPool for 4 years now.	I am going on 70 but am still in very good shape, but have just gone	on low dose BP medication so have cut way back on the salt and started	cardio routines which (duh!) includes an exercise pool.	I was an Olympics hopeful in my teens and trained every day at the	San Diego Town and Country Club (At that time, the only one in Mission Valley) as	it was the only Olympic sized pool available to me except for NAS (now Marine air station)	on Kearny Mesa.	Never made it due to finances; as so many American athletes succumb to, but	did swim for the Marine Corps.	Full size lap pools and pump pools are insanely expensive, or take up to much	room, and I have other things to do with the money I live on.	The pool took me about 6 hours to set up at a medium pace and doing other things	in between. (You know us old folks; we wonder off once and a while)	Putting the side rail pieces in was a bit of a challenge, as you need to pay attention	to exactly what side you want the harness on, ladder on, and pump on (which by the way	iPool calls a filter).	While we are on the filter subject, iPool recommends replacing the Filter which is the	whole frigging unit once a year and says you should only run it for 4 to 6 hours a day.	I have had my iPool for a few months now and agree with the other reviewers about	the pump; IT IS A JOKE!	Don't even think about using this piece of junk, as it does not move any water.	Along with your iPool, go ahead and buy an Intex 637R (56637EG) filter pump from Amazon	at around $40.00 which hooks right up to the iPool 1-1/4" fittings. Use the supplied strainer	and water inlet nozzle and just shove them in the holes where the iPool supplied dome strainers	would go.	Also, the resistance cord does not last that long (rubber tube). I replaced the set up with fine strand nylon ropes, instead of spending $30.00 plus shipping for something that will go bad after two years.		The ladder is OK, but needs one more step on the inside at the bottom rung, and for the life of	me, I cannot figure out how iPool forgot this requirement. So you step inside to the only	step at the top and what is left? the frame tubing; not very comfortable. (I will be writing	iPool about this one)	I fixed this problem by using a thick piece of black hot water line foam insulation that comes with a new hot water heater (you can also buy six foot lengths at Ace, Home Depot, Etc), and just run tape around it in a few places to hold it on.	Once your in the pool, it is a great workout, and fulfills all of my requirements which says	it should take care of just about any one out there.	I agree with a comment from another reviewer that the tie points should be set at the end unless	you are trying to literally hold up a non swimmer or small child and then you move them up.	3 feet or 2-3/4 feet is more than enough to swim in, so don't get excited about water depth.		The cover is cheap, but works very well, even with the ladder and harness rig in place, but if you	live in a hot climate like I do (Mohave Valley AZ) you need to leave the cover off, or make sure you have a layer of water on top of the cover so that evaporative cooling of the water can take place. If you leave the cover on without this layer of water on top of it, the small pool will get very hot and feel like a bath. To winterize, I take off the overhead tubes, and use a 10'X 12' heavy duty canvas tarp with grommets that is very well tied down (does not touch water) so that the high winds that  come in winter do not rip the cover apart, as would happen with the standard plastic cover. Also, a heavy duty canvas tarp will cost you about the same as the plastic iPool cover.
0,I use this to water/fertilize my orchid. The spout is great for precise watering.
0,This shade is great.  Cost effective, and easy to install.  Keep it tight and it works great... I have not noticed any sun damage yet.  AZ desert sun... it seems to hold up well enough.
0,These seeds are what I expected. They haven't come up yet so I can't comment on the flowers
0,we bought this after our Weber cover finally fell apart.  The quality is excellent, however, the fit is not:(  We have a Weber Silver and it drags on the ground- I hope it will age well
0,Great chair.  Once you get in it you never want to get out.  Had to buy one for my hubby too because he wouldn't get out of mine.  We are taking them on vacation with us too.  Worth every penny.
0,Huge pieces of flower, well-packaged.  Very strong...it only takes a little to make a nice flavorful cup of tea with honey.
0,Good price, superb plant, expeditious delivery!
0,I have two faucets connected to my watering system which used to require me to walk to the garage, turn on the system and then walk back to the faucet to use it.  Now I just push a couple buttons and the water is on. (or off) The unit works great, easy to use and the pocket clip allows me to carry it hands free.  Great product.
0,Pretty impressive trap for someone who grew up with wooden traps that sometimes came apart while you were setting them. Nerve wracking and dangerous I mean the large size, the staples could pull out while you set it, or if you moved the trap it would go off and flip through the air. They really WOULD kill rodents no doubt. I bought one of these Tomcat traps for squirrels that ravage our gardens. I was confident that once caught escape would be impossible. I have observed. The red squirrels here are athletic, fed peanuts by neighbors and getting into dog food they are sleek and strong with incredible reflexes. I have only found a few hairs in the peanut butter after resetting the trap 10X times. The trap is good, the squirrels are better. I even screwed it to the fence vertically thinking there was NO WAY a squirrel could travel down and back out fast enough. I was wrong. I bought a $45  7000 volt "electric chair". We'll see. I know I can't defeat an army of squirrels but I can get a few. The Tomcat trap is probably fine for mice and rats	OK Update as of May 12, 2018. The squirrel is fiendishly clever and the trap has a design flaw. The CUP is way below the tab that trips the jaws...he sneaks in with his tongue and licks off peanut butter and doesn't even trip the trap. Forget the cup....put peanut butter on the tab that actually releases the spring.
0,Mine broke, but that's my fault. I think it's still a good product. I guess I should have realized this is not the right tool to cut down large trees (they even say so). So, having said it's a good little saw for the money, here's how I broke it :-)		I first used it to cut down quite a few branches, and ended up using it to cut down a big tree; 40" diameter and about 40' high. I got the tree down, and sawed 4 pieces off, but then it burned through. Too bad; I'll be buying a gas powered one now. :-)
0,great fit amd mower is back to cutting grass with mulching kit.
0,This is exactly what I was looking for but was a little to big.  Got some two part epoxy that is waterproof and attached and it works perfect.  Had to drill open some of the little holes also, but it work great.
0,I love it, crows hate it.
0,Good air stone, produces a lot of oxygen bubbles.  Perfect for 5 gal system
0,The instructions that came with the unit were a bit unclear. I was a bit scared to think of cutting through my Intex pool liner, but am soooo very glad I made this purchase! First off I did some research online for ANY videos on how to install, but didn't find any step by step ones. Here is my advice: 1.) On a Intex pool position skimmer unit so that it is just below the top seam line to avoid compromising the integrity of the pool liner construction, 2.) on a soft sided pool....like Intex you MUST separate the rubber gasket into two pieces! That is, DO NOT CUT THE LINER BEFORE INSTALLATION!!! The gasket is rectangular and appears to be one solid piece, but the depth/ thickness of it is actually split from the outside edge of the rectangle to just before the inner edge of the rectangle....kind of like a V shape from each outer side. To properly attach this skimmer to a soft sided pool, you will need to separate the gasket into two pieces by using an Exacto knife. Cut carefully, 3.) You then position the gasket with plastic rectangle to the inside of the pool and the other gasket and rest of unit to the outside of the pool. Once you have followed the directions for screwing the unit together ( follow this exactly...the screw order and tightening order), you can attach the hose to your filter system, 4.) Then very carefully cut the center out of the skimmer, which is the pool side.	I had a few drips on the outside, but going back and carefully tightening the screws made it watertight. Just be careful not to over tighten the screws or you will get leaks or worse yet crack the inside faceplate and creating even bigger leaks.	This unit has done an excellent job of keeping debris out of my pool. As a side note, I replaced the Intex pump/filter with a used sand filter and pump. The Intex pumps/filters just didn't do the job well and cost a lot to keep replacing the filter cartridges.
0,Fit and seem to be OK, time will tell if they hold up.
0,I used these along with Temco 10 AWG power cable to make a 30' extension cable for my Renogy 100w Suitcase Solar panel.  These connectors work good.  I used a crimping tool that I purchased from Renogy which made a real difference and made this much easier.
0,Great purchase and receipt action.  Already aired up and ready to go.
0,We live in South East Texas where mosquitos carry off small children. My kids play outdoor sports all year. They keep a can of 3M Ultrathon in their gear bags next to their sports equipment. It works great!		I have read a few reviews where people were having trouble with the spray nozzle. ***There is nothing wrong with the lid.*** In fact the spray nozzle is the ***BEST*** part of the product. The repellent has a locking feature. When you purchase a can of Ultrathon it will come in the locked position. if you press down on the sprayer it will not spray. If you want to use the product, simply twist the lid and click it out of the locked position. Then it will spray like any other aerosol sprayer. When done, twist the lid back into the locked setting. With the can locked my kids just toss it back into their gear bags and don't have to worry about getting repellent all over their bag and sports equipment.
0,Extremely happy with the color and the comfort.  Also, that I can fold it up easily for storage in the fall.
0,Us it on the end of my lawn hoses.  Nice tight seal, easy to adjust the water off or on.
0,Nice construction, not flimsy plastic sprinkler that bends and falls all of the time.  Seems to cover a wide space and gets over taller plants to water the entire area.  No complains
0,Why didn't we use these years sooner. So much easier than moving the lights link by link every time the plants grew taller. Don't think it over, just get these. You'll be glad.
0,Very nice looking chairs.  They look great and yet a light weight so it isn't hard to carry them and move them	around.  Some assembly required, but very easy.
0,Works as intended
0,So much easier to use than our last salt cell. I highly recommend buying the acid cleaning cap that is not included as this makes cleaning the chlorinator easy. Also be prepared to change your pipes so the caps fit. After installation of the power center, all you had to do was plug it in...which I loved. Now I can only hope it lasts longer than my last one.
0,perfect replacement part
0,I was so happy to find this as my other one fell apart from all the rain we have been having. I forgot to take it in this winter but will take it inside for sure from now on.
0,did the job
0,kills everything you spray it on - awesome
0,Great product, works as expected
0,It worked great think you.
0,Must have item if you use your grill camping. It keeps the rain out of the fittings which causes the grill to go out after a few seconds. This eliminates that issue.
0,I have used Terro many times to control ants in the house. They seem to love it. It can take week or even longer for the ants to go away, but after using Terro for a few days, the number of ants present in the house goes down significantly.
0,Exact OEM replacement for my broken cover
0,Fantastic storage option for all my knitting supplies, plus it's easy to take to & from anywhere (knitting store, vacation, etc.).
0,It works,even on difficult weeds.  Used on various vine and other types of weeds.  It took 2-3 days but was worth the effort.
0,good product sale services; and properly valued
0,Small but mighty.  East to use and nice to look at.
0,I love these grill baskets for grilling large chunks of veggies on the grill. I cut up peppers, onions, musrooms, zucchini, and add balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper and you're good to go. Everyone raves about my grilled veggies.		This basket has a nice teflon coating and prevents sticking, which happens a lot with my weber baskets. However, please not this cannot withstand head over 400 degrees or the coating will peel off. I almost never cook below 400 degrees, so I find I have to cook the veggies first and then my burgers. If you keep that in mind, overall this basket should serve you well.
0,Works great to eliminate yard insects. I use twice a year around the flower beds of the house and in the yard.
0,When converting our lighting over to LED, I almost omitted the vanity lighting. This is not to say it is not important because it is; all of our bathrooms have vanity lights installed. I simply did not think about them at first. Part of that is because of the way LED lights had been previously perceived, with their cumbersome shark fin mutations that made them interesting to look at but not capable of simply blending in. G7 has taken care of that by producing quality replacements made for durable materials that perform exceedingly well. I say that currently using 5 types of their bulbs around my home and implementing quite a few in those areas.		When it comes to 8 watt, 50 watt equivalent, we can really see the differences while getting ready in the morning. This makes a huge difference on how you dress or apply makeup and it eliminates a lot of smaller mistakes like not spotting subtle coloration differences or missing minute spots. This LED bulb produces a clean light, meaning that it brightens and adds warmth without overpowering like conventional bulbs oftentimes do. They also use less energy and that makes economic sense, and they are guaranteed to last.		Note that the initial bulb was supplied as a sample, and that we have since added more to our home because we believe in the product and company.
0,Excellent convenience.
0,This is second time I got this, it keep my pond water clear, and my koi happy with it.
0,So pretty!  I love that she's holding a cat, my cat in heaven!!!
0,This thing really cuts trees.  I enjoy it, and the beauty of its design.
0,my cusin loved it so all her frinds are ordering from this company
0,Awesome hose! Its lightweight and easy to use.
0,this cover is made really well, I just orderd one way to big, will get the correct size as soon as the money alows. It was delivered promptly.	THANKS
0,My old pan and holder were rusted and broken.  I was happy to see that I could get this one easily online.
0,Perfect decor for our pirate themed classroom.  LOVE it!  Great price and fast shipping!
0,The price of this is high, but worth it. I cannot believe how well my plants are doing with this stuff, it's almost like they were meant to grow in water!		Okay, but really. This stuff works great, the only downside is that it takes half the bottle of FloraGro for 40 gallons of water. I will be upgrading to the gallons and switching to a 2-week cycle to save money since I'm only doing this as a hobby. I plan on adding Floralicious Plus to my plants diet (lol) to make they grow better.
0,Works great with my smoker, can monitor meat temp without letting the smoke out by opening door.
0,good product
0,The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 star was the look. This pot, although a great look and good price, it does look like plastic......... if you really look close. Yet let's face it the pot looks fantastic and will perform great. I do wish that at the price a saucer would have been included. However, this pot should last for years and won't chip or crack. All in all I'm pleased.
0,I was very impressed with this product when I first found them over a year ago at a brick and mortar store that I needed more after going through all 4 of them, finally. I am not finding them anywhere.... So i was happy to find them here. They were re-designed though. There are not the same ones I found in the store, but a major improvement. Now the mouse has 2 ways to get in and get caught. I love the easy-to-remove bait trap, and the mice *DO* find their way inside the traps. They absolutely do work and work well. I use cheese and all-natural chunky peanut butter as bait. There is one thing to note, though... I wasn't getting mice for almost 6 months and stopped checking my traps and then smelled an awful odor one day. I checked a trap to find that I had caught a mouse and it was dead for so long that it had leaked bodily fluids. So check your traps regularly or there CAN be a mess to clean up. Thankfully, that drawer was empty, but the trap and the liner all went in the trash.... Oh my. Thanks!
0,So glad I got despite a few negative reviews. Looks great and no problem through many rains. Our yard looks like a park and this is a nice addition.
0,Work in our hot tub and less expensive than the local supplier.
0,Well pleased with this item.
0,I have used any number of different seed starting mixes over the years and have found many of them lacking.  This Espoma organic seed starter is among the very best.  First of all, it has a minimum of larger particles to interfere with the placement of small seeds.  Secondly, it readily absorbs water so that I don't have to go to great lengths to moisten the mix. Thirdly,it is organic, so I don't concern myself with the presence of components that I wouldn't want in a mix, and finally, the results are exactly what I would want: vibrant, healthy seedlings that I can expect to mature to healthy plants!  I might also add that for the quantity and the price, it is a bargain.
0,Came well packaged and looked healthy. Now to wait for when it will bloom.
0,Works better than expected.
0,I use it with my electric power washer.  I did not need much length and this worked fine.
0,well i can see why people have a hard time starting it, but if you read the directions it starts great. mine starts within the third pull. it has a high idle that engauges when you put the choke on. it cuts great but i think it is a little under powered. but all and all  it is a great saw at an affordable price
0,Just kidding,  the roller works very well and went together very fast.  I used Teflon tape on the water plug and I have no leaks.	What do you call Batman and Robin after being run over by the Brinkley roller?	Flatman and Ribbon.
0,My plants seem to be jumping out of their pots they are growing so fast. I like this product because I don't  have to flush my plants before I take them down.
0,I have just started to use them and find them to run a little large for my hands but otherwise, seem to do the job on soil that is not too tightly compacted.  Good idea!
0,Fit my Toro Recycler mower with Briggs & Stratton engine.  Good price, delivered to my door.  What's not to like?
0,Great feeder! The birds don't fly through seed like they did the old feeder I had.
0,it works great
0,A great American made product, this water hose has a lifetime waranty, how great is that, shipment arrived in great shape
0,This works perfectly and fits DR mower's 2.5 gallon fuel tank.
0,Excellent transaction AAA+++ Great price Quick Ship
0,These are great and arrived quickly and exactly as expected. I have only been gardening for 6 years, but I believe I have tried just about every starter tray kit on the market, and these are just so much more economical than buying those sets. I think they give you plenty of room to get your plants going, and yes, you will need to move some plants (tomatoes, peppers, etc) to larger containers, but these are great for starting seeds. I am surprised at the quality of the plastic. Seems to be more sturdy than some I have left over from last year from my local market.		These fit perfectly in the trays that I saved from the sets I bought last year at Walmart.		I will be buying these again!
0,Excellent fit, sturdy build, and economical quantity for very dusty needs.
0,seems to add well to my full on assault !!!!
0,I have had this for a while now. It is very durable and the birds flock to it. It makes much less of a mess than the hanging feeder I was using. The birds would just empty the feeder onto the ground. This works much better and easy to clean. I'm glad I decided to buy this one rather than the less expensive platform feeders.
0,The flag is very vivid and attractive. I am a little concerned that the material is somewhat thin and, living in a high-wind area - I may see signs of wear before too long. It was considerably cheaper than other flags of the same size - probably due to the lighter material being used.		My experience with the thicker, tougher flags has been that - although they wear well - they tend to fade much sooner than this flag appears to be doing.
0,great value
0,The best product for the money.  Burns clean and I light lump charcoal with these exclusively.  With briquets, I use the Weber chimney.  These work mush better than the square pieces that resemble ply wood.  Again, anything with the "Weber" name will work.
0,I have bad knees to start with so using this in the garden helps relieve the pain I usually have while working with plants, you can also walk around with these and they stay in place.
0,work real well, fast delivery, good price.
0,This is well constructed & perfect size for my Masterbuilt 30" smoker & stand.
0,I just received these today and assembled them - very easy.  The chairs look great and the quality appears to be good - will have to see how they hold up outside.  I would suggest putting a drop of wood glue in each hole before pounding in the peg.
0,Used 1 to fight the fly issue at the house for the season and filled it up and won the war this season.
0,Great product and works well on my son's Science project.
0,Very good quality.  Easily attaches securely. Gives good flexibility.
0,I would up not needing the line for my snow blower, but I've got several other gas powered tools that may need new fuel lines.  This was a good selection of sizes for my tools.
0,One of the best investments I ever made in home maintenance, the little Shop Vac works great for picking up ashes and debris from the use of a wood stove or fireplace.  You can wash the filters several times....A pack of three will probably last a year.
0,The red prayer plant arrived well packaged and in great shape. The leaves have a lot of color and I have received several compliments on the plant so far. I have it in my office in an east facing window. I have been misting the plant with a spray bottle and trying to monitor the soil moisture level. I'm not very good at taking care of plants so I hope this one is low maintenance.
0,Great quality and all four of my patio cushions fit like a glove!  I definitely like this product line!
0,Just as advertised by seller. Works great and stands up better than regular line.
0,Solid fire pit cover that is large.
0,What is not to like about it.  I wondered at first if there were actually strands of wire of some sort.  There isn't and that's probably a good thing.  It does a good job.
0,Your hum-birds will love this better than others. They actually get a chance to perch and drink, which must be a luxury for a hummingbird. Holds a lot, doesn't leak, good big hook, and will be the hang-out for every hummer in the area.
0,works great.
0,For many years I used to have a similar birdhouse on a protected side of our garage but when the garage was repainted we took the bird house down and it wasn't in good enough shape to put back up. I was delighted to find this one, which is made in the USA, and which apparently meets the needs of the black-capped chickadee family which took up residence in it fairly quickly!
0,This stuff is great, non-toxic and effective.
0,Very tiny. Smaller than I thought it'd be. Still it works for my garden. Colorful. Cute details. Not sure how they photograph these miniatures to make them look bigger but sometimes deceiving. Arrived ahead of scheduled delivery date.
0,Very good quality flag.  The colors are true and looks very nice.  Used during cold snowy weather and the colors didn't run or change.  Very nice.
0,Easy to set up, easy to see...
0,Excellent signs for high visibility selling! The for sale sign is in bright red and very visible! Very happy with purchase!
0,good quality
0,This item fit the BBQ.  They don't last forever, but it does the job.  Cleaning the grate and oiling it before storage helps extend the life.
0,I split quite a few large logs with it, the ones I can't take with splitting axe.	It gets the job done for sure, for larger logs I recommend having two of them, so if first one gets stuck, you can go from another side of the log.	I'll get 2nd one for sure.
0,Haven't needed it yet but the Edger works fantastic.  Light weight and simple to use.  Remember to wear protective glasses as stuff flies.
0,Great value ! Perfect display to remind others of the reason we celebrate Christmas.  Easy set up
0,Works great, no issues.
0,Good product. Very sturdy. Arrived on time.
0,A well-designed pot with nice stoneware look.	Not sure if it is a handling problem or product problem, but there is a slight issue that deeper scratches can mar the design like the stoneware design is surface only.
0,Works Great with Hayward Navigator
0,These are good size. Probably about the size of a large grapefruit. Very bright. They attract the moths at night. Nice buy.
0,Very large and easy to read.  Seems to be very accurate.  Bought it for the patio so I would know if I was hot or cold (just kidding).  Nice to have and very reasonably priced.
0,Have used various Schultz plant foods for many years with great results.  Easy to use for those who like to feed on a weekly basis.
0,Nice replacements...time will tell if the "stainless" is durable
0,great item
0,The light is the best part about the product. It throws a sparkling array onto our porch and when the wind blows slightly it magnifies the effect. The spinner does not move as freely as I had anticipated but like I said, that effect works well where we have it hanging.
0,while all poison kills rats  this one appeals to them must be smell and taste . they will go for this an d leave  others alone
0,This is a very handy tool...light weight, and easily adjusted.  The two batteries allow for extended use. Wish I'd had this year's ago.  It's great for grass, but not quite robust enough to take down areas overgrown with tall weeds.
0,okay
0,This is a must in my garden! Wouldn't be happy without it in my soil as the effects are very evident in the bloom of my flowers, such wonderful bouquets!
0,Ordered and received this within 2 days with Prime.	I took the gauge to the local store where I get my propane tanks filled and they kid was impressed as he had never seen anything like this.	I was told that a full tank should weight in at around 18lbs. He tried the gauge and liked it very much as well as I do now. I keep it handy hanging by a hook on the side of my grille now and will use it to check the status of any tank that begins to get a low flame. Although a low flame on high setting should be enough to tell anyone that you are low on gas. I keep 3 tanks on premises that usually last me throughout the year for my grilling needs. Thank you PBKay for your fast shipping and for carrying this wonderful product that I can not seem to find anywhere else.
0,After watching the cute litte birds at my friends house, I decided to get one myself.  I bought two and at first I thought I didn't like the design and the rim seemed too far away from the flowers because I've only seen them fluttering their wings and feeding in the air,  so I requested for a return label......then I decided to try one because my cheap dollar store one was leaking constantly.  Geez was I wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My hummies love it and they do perch on the rim to feed.  It holds a full batch that I make and now I don't have to fill it up as often.  I mix four cups of water with one and a half cups of sugar.  I am now keeping both and I took the advice of another customer and bought the Baby Bottle Brush from Superior Performance Inc because she said it fits great inside this feeder and she was right.  I bought three brushes to give one to my friend and one to my daughter who also went out and bought a feeder for her house after I bought mine.  It is well made and doesn't leak.  The hanging hook is a cheap plastic, but that piece can be replace with something sturdier and to me is not an issue.  So I give it five stars.
0,First, these are used for decoration only. The colors are really this vibrant. I love how it looks in the garden.
0,This cover is better than my original because 1) it fits better - is much easier to get on and 2) it feels more supple and not as stiff.
0,Grows plants well as advertised!
0,Works well (but not connected to the internet...)
0,have hat it up for over a year now shaws no sign of wear or fatieg won't have to buy another for quiet some time
0,Have been looking forward to getting this spade.  Tried it out in a few places in my yard and it works beautifully.
0,My husband tried using this to dig a few holes in the yard. He said it did get a bit tangled on some roots, but if you just lifted it out you could start again. It uses the charge on the drill (battery-powered) pretty quickly. I can definitely see some uses for this, such as loosening soil in a flower bed each spring; churning the compost, digging holes if you want to plant a LOT of bulbs, etc. With that in mind, remember that you will need to store it somewhere and take the time to find it and hook it up (which probably tells you how messy our shed is). I expect we will use it sometimes (e.g., for bulbs in the fall) and just rely on old-fashioned muscle power the rest.
0,I just pruned back my roses for the season, worked like a charm.
0,Excellent quality and durability.  The stars are a high quality embroidery!
0,OMG I never knew there were so many flies at my home. Within just a few days the container was just about full. I now need to order more bait. I suggest you buy more than one of these traps place them around the outside of your home or area where there are flies you will be shocked at the turn out that comes to the party. Make sure you order more bait you will need it in no time.		You DO NOT want to place it to close to open windows or doors the smell is really bad but flies LOVE it. Make sure you do not spill it or you will be forever getting the smell out. It is very easy to use with amazing results. I plan on buying more but maybe bigger is better here or at least a few of the qt ones for sure.		Do not forget to buy more bait you will need it.		For the price and the effect at catching flies this is for sure the better buy, it is reusable unlike the others I have bought, easy to put together and hang is a breeze. With my quail and rabbits this is a must for me. I am beyond amazed at how well this works and how wonderful it is. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.
0,Love this
0,Perfect size for our small, but kind of tall plant in our office.
0,I bought 3 of these instead of the 4 foot long version to hold my yard tools on 24" on center studs in my shed. It easily holds the weight of an 8 pound sledge, but I still keep the sledge under it because I would harte to knock it off onto my foot. I do have shovels stacked 2 deep next to each other on 1 rack (6 total), and they fit perfectly.
0,I like the fact that it's no shock. My big dog is noise aversive and I had hoped it'd work for her. It did work for a short while, however, I have another dog (Boston terrier) who is a tenacious barker who just ignored the noise and provoked the other into continued barking after a few days. I'm going to try them again at the highest noise level and hope for better results.
0,I bought this poulan Pro December 28-2016 today is August 6-2018 this weed trimmer has not failed once it performs as it should. I have (zoysia grass) this is a very dense type of grass and this trimmer does a fine job cutting it.  I have no problems with starting it, I'm still using the original sparkplug that came with the unit. I only use my trimmer for two hour at a time so I cannot speak beyond that, but I like this poulan trimmer and I would buy it again. I'm planning on buying a poulan blower, because raking takes to long and doesn't pick up the smaller grass clippings, and I can't get into some areas with the rake.
0,Sounded good it look very humane. Didn't catch anything yet. May be I didn't use it properly, who knows...
0,I run a small exotic animal rescue. This is a good adjunct to prevent digestive issues from happening in rodents, chinchillas, rabbits, degus, and of course, dogs and cats.  Use during intestinal diarrhea to help end the problem, along with any antibiotics if necessary. Always check with your vet on antibiotics.  This helps restore good bacteria, and is also good when feeding orphaned animals that don't have sufficient gut flora yet.		EDIT: for some reason Amazon has this product listed as ortho bug killer, this review is for Benebac powder for animals.
0,This wide shovel has saved me a lot of time shoveling. Now I can just clean my whole sidewalk in one pass. I'm not sure why I didn't buy this along time ago...
0,Fits good, hope the flex portion holds up in the heat.
0,Despite the costly shipping, I am glad that I purchased this item - it i made of dense plastic that stands up to severe weather and heavy pots.  Unlike transparent saucers that are widely available at home improvement stores, this one does not discolor and is made of much thicker material that is made to last.
0,It looks great, feels durable, and fits like a glove.  I don't know how it will hold up in Texas weather. Because of that I was hesitant to give it 5 stars right out of the gate, But i did anyway because so far it's held up to its description.
0,While I do not like the thought of killing any living creature, when they spread disease (like mice and mosquitoes), it's important to try and keep populations down.	These work in the same kind of way as the wood traps, but are easier to manage. I always seem to have good luck with peanut butter as bait. just place a dab, set, and put it in the area with the problem.	Yes, they work, and it looks like they killed quickly.
0,THESE HEADS EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. THE COVERAGE IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED. WHAT A TREAT TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT REALLY DOES THE JOB. PLUS, IT IS NEAT TO WATCH THEM WORK.
0,Very Happy
0,August 2, 2014 update:  One of the strings that close/hang the feeder broke, but it was not the products fault; it was mine.  Instead of pressing the spring loaded release to open the feeder for refilling, I would just force the string through it; resulting in fraying and eventually, breaking.  That was my bad.  So, don't do as I did and cause premature failure of the drawstring.		Other than that, they are holding up beyond my expectations.	_____________________________________________________________		As I wanted to have use this product several fillings to see how well it holds up to the weather.		So far, so good.  They seem to be of a higher quality fabric over the ones you buy prefilled.  I have refilled them now four times and they are not showing any signs of failure from both the elements and the birds.		While a bit pricy, I still would recommend these to all my bird loving friends. You can't put a price on the pleasure you  get from watching Goldfinches, Pine siskins and house finches feed from them.
0,Works fine, reasonable price I guess. .The design ensures this is a product that will have to be replaced eventually.
0,Super comfy and the color is so vibrant!  So exited. Delivery took a while but it was worth it for the price and quality
0,Love my Gomboy. Cuts fast and smooth. Can't go wrong with this saw. I have 5 silky products and all are awesome and serve their purpose well.
0,Bought it for my daughter (a single mom) who lives in the Catskills.	  I found out that she was cutting fireplace logs with a circular saw and sent it to her right away.	  It's safer, light weight and easy to use (no mixing gas and oil, or yanking on a starter rope).		  It's too new to know how durable it will be, but unless she turns into a lumber jack it should do fine.
0,they sure work greatg,  I use when running filter and boy does it get the small stuff and also saves in replacing the filter
0,Great stuff.
0,Does the job! Sturdy!
0,Worked perfectly and a great fit!
0,HOLY COW!!! This is probably the best $25 I've ever spent. It would be a good blower at $50, but for $25 you can't beat it.
0,Growing really well!
0,It does the job and looks good.  As you might expect, for the price, it's not terribly robust.
0,Proud display it with our Israeli flag.
0,Good product........
0,i was so impressed with this tent I bought a second one. The quality for the money can't be beat. As far as the minor pin holes some people complain about is crazy .If  You have a 600 watt light in it it will show some pin holes from the outside. What does it hurt for the light to show a few pin holes? However if you get in the tent with light out no outside light of regular room lighting penetrates . When grown outdoors the moon can be very bright without affecting the plants. Pin holes will not hurt your grow . I promise. The results I have had proves the point. Happy growing!
0,I bought the 10 gallon brown bags and the 5 gallon gray bags as well.  Both are made extremely well and work great so far.  If they make it through a couple years I'll upgrade this post to a five star
0,Works well . Not a great fit .
0,My fiddle leaf fig came quickly and looked beautiful. Thanks!
0,Good protection for the transmitter unit - the only complaint is the cover (roof) is predrilled for an antenna, which is not necessary for the wireless unit I bought (DCMA-2500). I just formed some spare acrylic I had lying around to cover the hole and keep the rain and ice out and that was that. The wood is stained but not sealed, so you have to do that before mounting outside or you'll be replacing it in a year or so.
0,A perfect replacement for the valve on my 40-year-old S200 sand filter.  After all this time and a couple of rebuilds, the original valve developed a crack in the body that couldn't be repaired.
0,GREAT
0,A must for the swinging bench.  Makes the movement very smooth and quiet.
0,Helps to keep the next door cat out of my garden.
0,This has been a very good solar lighting kit for my new shed so far.  Everything seems very well made with nice long cords.
0,perfect cover
0,Very solid piece. Unfortunately made in cheena
0,This hose pot is very attractive and keeps the hose neatly stored.  One suggestion I would make if you are thinking of buying this product:  this hose pot works best with a very flexible hose. One hose we own is not flexible at all and I had trouble neatly placing the hose inside the pot.  I now store 100 feet of SpringHose coil hose inside the hose pot and that works great.
0,The unit is quite large across.  The baked on enamel paint is quite well done, thick and with vibrant color.  Quality is excellent as is the quality of the pole which comes apart into two pieces.  Assembly is very easy although each flower (like the blades of the wind mill) need to be turn or bent at 30 degrees to create the angle to catch the wind so that the entire circle would spin.  Both sides of this double wheel will need to be treated this way.  It is very easy and there is a diagram.  Take care to do this correctly so that each wheel is bent correctly so when the unit is assembled and inserted into the ground, the two wheels will counter spin to create the best effect.  It isn't hard at all but user should do this carefully.  The unit does take a nice draft to have enough energy to spin it.  It is quite nice looking when it does.  I enjoy it and I like the quality.  PS:  After several days of spinning, one side has fallen off.  I need to see what happened.
0,Best hose nozzle I've owned. I love the thumb control and it seems like a durable and well made product. Even my husband commented on how much better it was than others we've owned.
0,Works great! Thanks!
0,excellent quality.  looks great.
0,Been working all summer long and still going strong....love them!
0,Good to have in supply for outdoor power equipment exposed to a lot of dirt.
0,This is perfect for storing outdoor "stuff" on my back patio! It will fit a TON of stuff. Chair cushions, our outdoor dishes, and pool toys!
0,Love these. I put my porch christmas trees in them.
0,Good sturdy pool. The fittings seem a bit loose....not sure how long this will last
0,Works great! Seems to be an exact replacement for Members Mark grill. Good investment.
0,Simple, rustic, really cute.
0,rewind is a breeze
0,OK
0,We have been having problems with rats around our chicken coop and wood pile this year. Normally we have maybe 1 or 2 and don't bother doing anything but this year there were more than usual and we finally decided we needed to do something when they started coming out during the day and running all over the kids' toys in the yard.		Loaded this trap with some peanut butter and crackers and caught a rat within the first hour! We sometimes accidentally catch birds or squirrels but they are easy to release and it does not hurt them at all.		TIPS:	 The corners of the trip plate are a little sharp so put a little duct tape on them so it doesn't hurt the critters.	 Put a brick or two on top of the trap to keep the critters from flipping it over.	 Lightly draping a towel or rag over the top to hide the sides to disguise the trap can help disguise it.	 Roasted, shelled peanuts make a great bait for rodents.		I would definitely buy this trap again. A great value for the money.
0,very useful
0,I ordered the Aquabot APRVJR Pool Junoir Robotic vacuum and it has worked great so far. I haven't had any problems so far. My question is can you put the robotic vacuum in the pool while putting in pool chemicals without it harming the vacuum?
0,lightweight tropical looking chairs is what I needed. I put them away after use, it is windy where they are. very nice.
0,Its still going!!
0,great
0,While the plants were nice and shipped with care quickly.  I was torn about the evidence of munching insects on the leaves. On one hand it is good that these are organic. On the other, I am concerned I may be adding a new pest to my garden. Overall they planted well and seem healthy and I see no evidence of any additional pests.
0,I am a first time chicken owner and bought this adorable coop for my three Dominiques.  The coop is really well made and very sturdy.  It has all the perfect doors and openings you could ask for and is very secure.  The plastic trays in the bottom of the nesting boxes and under roosting bar make it easy to clean.  The roosting bar is  a good size and the wire netting on the run has very small holes so snakes are not able to get in.  The latches are sturdy and well made.  My only complaint is that the instructions for putting it together were not great and only included six pictures to show you what to do.  It took about two hours but probably should have taken 45 minutes.
0,exactly the part I needed
0,Have used this regularly for the past year with good results. Purchased on the advice of a neighbor.
0,Excellent for those romantic picnics
0,Worked great in my McLane 20" mower.
0,Only issues was the screw top, it doesn't really fit to well, but it does hold a seal.  The product works great to smooth out ruts in the mud and to level a lawn.
0,Tough
0,Very good quality. It pours water slowly (great for the plants) and the swiveling nose makes it very easy to use and store.
0,Used these at the Blues & Brews festival on our camper awning and got tons of compliments. They held up great, just the right size.  Someone had commented that the little "umbrella" looking cap over the foam was "clever" as it looked like the Rocky Mountains ... LOL  Didn't see that 'till they mentioned it and it does .. No fading and we had them up for 5 days
0,Arrived on time, works fine
0,Perfect for diy clone bucket! Just add a little rockwool.
0,Beautifully hand-painted, high quality stone! I will definitely order more products from this company! Very quickly received too on prime!
0,These bulbs are great. Excellent quality. Perfect for my orchids I had to bring inside for winter. Plants are thriving.
0,Fast shipping and good price
0,good stuff sent by great seller
0,The mole holes everywhere have stopped
0,I will give this a 5 start because of quality of the flag being nicely sewn and a nice staff, but.....I'm not sure what they are thinking giving way small diameter screws vs drilled holes in the base approx. 1/4". These screws with drywall plastic compressions are fine for hanging pictures indoors but a flag outdoors? Also the base drilled holes are not countersunk. Now you may think I'm being picky about the countersunk holes ,but not really. When you countersink a hole it allows for countersunk screws. Countersunk screws will prevent movement and lock the base from movement remember this is subject to wind and it's forces, without these the flag base will worry back and forth loosening the screws. So for me it's still a 5 star it's easily fixed, use larger countersunk screws and countersink the base. I would not recommend using the screws it comes with what were they thinking?
0,Huge block of coco coir.... fast to absorb water and easy to use and mix.  No smell, clean. Created my own seed starting mix with this and worm castings, plants are growing well and don't dry out.  Intend to also loosen my garden soil with this.
0,I was having problems with cat poo on my artificial turn on my front yard almost everyday.  I purchased a Solar Ultrasonic Repellent before I bought this one.  This repellent is very unreliable and decided to upgrade it to this one.		I now have a poo free front lawn every morning I look out my window.
0,Excellent table cover for my Sheepshead group. Fits perfectly.
0,Works as it should but the cups break off every couple years.
0,great little feeder for putting into a potted planter,  I used mine on a hanging planter and the birds love it,  some feeders birds don't seem to like . this one doesn't have that problem they fight over who get to feed at this one.  the bee proof yellow piece is a bonus too
0,I fly kites and knowing wind speed is a big help.  The product does exactly what I expected however I'm having an issue using the "Average Winds Speed".  This isn't important to me so not a big deal and it could be user error on my side but not worth trying to figure it out since I don't need it.  My only complaint is that you have to unscrew the battery compartment, which means keeping a small screw driver in the case.  I had one so no big deal but I don't see a reason to manufacturer it this way rather than just using a pressure clip to hold the cover.		How I review:	When I review a product said product automatically starts with four stars as I rarely will purchase anything below four stars.  I then add and/subtract stars based on certain criteria as listed below.	1. If an item is exactly what I expected and nothing more it will receive a four star rating	2. If an item surpasses my expectations it will gain a star (5 Stars)	3. If an item goes slightly below my expectations it will lose a star (3 Stars)	4. If the instructions for the product (if needed) are poorly written (hard to understand due to language issues or grammar) or just too hard to follow it will lose a star no matter if the product meets or exceed my expectations	5. If a product is significantly below my expectations I will deduct two stars	6. It will be rare that I would give a product one star since I buy mostly items that have a 4+ rating but in rare instances there may be a good reason that even a four star product gets a one star rating from me.  It could be because of customer service issues from the company but whatever the case is I will clearly explain my reason for giving a product only one star
0,Exact replacement for my hydrostatic filter on my Toro Z mower.
0,The way we go through this stuff this is the least expensive way to purchase it.
0,Great Price
0,Primary purpose to quickly stop a rather large number of carpenter ants from gaining a homestead on our deck. RA&RK put an immediate and long-lasting (2 weeks so far) stop to their presence.
0,Arrived alive and in good shape.  No complaints.
0,House was infested! Haven't seen any bugs since i ran it around the interior and exterior perimeter
0,This is the best bird feeder on the market today.  Couple this with an Arundale 17" umbrella and the squirrels are foiled - except for the small flying rocket squirrels with suction cups for toes.  The new Brome lower weather guard will deter those flying squirrels who must approach from the top on a glide.  Mine has worked so far.  Cardinals love the circle.  The feeder is well made and of high quality. I dropped my last one from 30 feet and it did not take the fall well so I decided to buy a new one.  I highly recommend this feeder.
0,Best ever
0,Bought first Ray Padula hose nozzle about 5 years ago.  Better than top brand nozzles sold at garden centers.
0,My firefighter husband has been on the search for the best hose sprayer. I bought this for him for his Christmas stocking because it was novel (looks like the nozzles he uses at work) but now we are both convinced it's the best sprayer we've ever had! Won't be buying any other type again! Easy to turn on/off, doesn't get stuck, and the best part is it's easy to change the spray type (and it has every type of spray you'd need!).
0,It was larger than I imagined, and was very easy to put together and its building materials seem pretty good.
0,It's a beautiful flag, and I am a repeat customers.  What do I love about this flag?  It's smaller than the more standard-sized flags you see on the market, and smaller means that it doesn't catch as much wind.  I have broken too many flag poles with the larger flags in windy conditions.  This slightly smaller flag doesn't put as much force on my pole.  I leave the flag up 24/7/365, and this flag is very high quality.  It doesn't fade quickly or tear or otherwise go to heck.  Eventually, though, any flag will need to be replaced.  Every couple of years, I retire one and put up a new one.
0,Looks good and bird friendly. Also holds a good amount of seeds.
0,Thanks
0,Definitely not as quiet as a mouse fart (even when using a speed limiter) but it really pulls some air!		Sounds about as loud as a low power microwave.		Try plugging the mount holes for extra quietude.
0,Very cute and not so tiny that it won't be visible -- which is the case with some of the items i have ordered.
0,Easy install but it did not come with a key
0,This product was highly recommended and it is doing it's job.  Quick shipping, too.  Thanks!
0,value for the money
0,The wild birds, in my area, absolutely LOVE this stuff!  I definitely plan on ordering again!
0,oh my gosh, I love this thing. I got it because I was always hosing down around our pool because of leaves and pine needles. This thing is fabulous!!!*** I love it so much. I use it every single day. Its light and the charge is fine for what I need. My husband has used it after he mowed the lawn. Love it, love it love it	buy one****** its the best
0,I use fox farms soils and nutrients for all my plants... Their products work!
0,A little complicated to program but it works. I have two: One for the front yard, one for the backyard. Ttake them off before freezing temperatures arrive to prevent freezing and cracking.
0,These work fantastic for pantry moths my Mom got when she bought a bad bag of sunflower seed that these multiplied out of....a long with the use of diatmous Earth powder (spell?).
0,Great!!
0,Very well made Hydroponic slotted pots.  Not flimsy.  Recommend.
0,Nice handle, flat and round files work as they should.  File guide is nice to keep the angles correct.  This was cheaper here on amazon than at the big box stores and the reason for my purchase.
0,Does the job very nicely. Attractive as it blends into the background. Stays put--and we have it on a notable slope, a real test.
0,Great
0,Great keeps my dogs out of my elephant ear plants.
0,This stuff works! As someone who doesn't want to use chemicals in our yard or garden, I am addicted to this stuff. It kills weeds pretty much immediately - just be sure and spray them on a nice, hot sunny day. I feel good knowing that I am using something on the garden that won't hurt our animals or the environment.
0,I have been using this product for a few years now. Along with the Ross Root Feeder tool, I have actually been able to accelerate the growth of certain trees in my yard. Easy to use and extremely efficient for keeping your favorite or major shade producing plants healthfully green. For the "yellow leaf" problem, Ross has an iron fortified fertilizer that works equally well.
0,Great product. Keeps my ph down after a rain storm.
0,Solid and comfortable.  There is no assembly.  Looks good!
0,Good greenhouse. I wish the window covers would fasten better.
0,This works well for lifting heavy logs off the ground for cutting.
0,I was looking for a filter for the hot tub.  I bought one locally then used the number and found it at Amazon.  It was half of what i paid locally, so I ordered two of them. When they arrived, they each contained a box of strips for checking the hot tub ph, chlorine, etc...  What a deal !
0,nothing is better than finding the things i need for our camper on amazon. I get them shipped to me in 2 days and it is totally affordable. this was the exact part i needed and i was only without a shower for a day.
0,Way too stiff, hard to use in tight places, great length.
0,exactly as described
0,Great product, good price
0,Item arrived as specified. Identical replacement. However, I never thought it would be so hard to install. It came with installation instructions..which is a plus. I was an Aircraft Engine Technician in the US Airforce and this removal and installation was not as simple as it should have been. But that being said the unit works great,
0,These are very sharp and easy to use.  I have small hands and they don't feel a bit awkward.  They work very well for trimming hooves.
0,These worked great no running up and down the ladder.
0,Perfect size to mark your plants so in the spring you won't have any difficulty in knowing which plants you planted and what are weeds!
0,Super device that makes pressure-cleaning large, flat surfaces quick and easy to clean.	What used to take me literally days to clean the apron/deck around my pool is now done in a matter of a couple of hours without back-breaking pain.
0,Item installed in a older system with self tapping screws. Had to make sure there was enough clearance from blades so holes on brackets were not used. Once installed item works great at helping maintain cutting bed level. Had to mold into cutting bed a little for a better fit. Had to shave off part of plastic where bolt is inserted because bolt was not long enough if flat washers provided are used. When you tighten bolts, wheel locks up. But over all works great. FYI, my lawn tractor is over ten years old but I was able to make this wheel kit work.
0,Less residue an excellent shock.
0,Just received today. Tried one out, excellent quality files. They are stamped with the name Oregon, Swiss made. Would buy them again.
0,I love this product - I swim several times a week, and my swimsuits die with regularity no matter how much I rinse them out.  Now I rinse my suit, and then I put some of this product in a plastic bag with shower water, squish my suit through the solution, and take my shower.  After I spin my suit as usual, and my latest suit has lasted months.  I recommend!
0,Great deal! i had trouble finding these in the store.
0,Perfect. A joy to hang it in our property, and show and share our faith. It's all about God and Country.
0,Bought this for a Intex 2650 GPH Filter Pump & Salt Water System, and it works well.  Some modification was required to get it past the outlet hose, but not difficult.  I would recommend.
0,The sensor worked as designed with my two weather station receivers. The Wireless Thermo Temp and Hydro sending unit operated with no problems encountered.
0,Bought for my Briggs engine rototiller. Ran rough. Hard to start. Ran rich. The old diaphram had just worn out. It now purrs and runs way more efficient.  Easy fix.
0,no more gas, no more oil, no more sparkplugs.....love this "green" mower
0,Extech makes multimeters and other high-tech devices.  They have tons of products and this one isn't even on their website.		But just check out their hygro-thermometer that costs about 3 more bucks than this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Extech-445715-Big-Digit-Hygro-Thermometer/dp/B000NI4AQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Extech 445715 Big Digit Hygro-Thermometer</a>.		If you compare, you'll see this guarantee under the product description of the one I linked:	"Accuracy: 4%RH; 1C/1.8F. Optional NIST traceable certificate satisfies ISO and. other regulatory body requirements for product accuracy. traceability to nationally recognized reference standards."		The difference is the humidity sensor is outside the unit.  All the devices with it inside the unit will be less accurate than if it was outside the unit.  Therefore, I recommend that if you're thinking of getting Extech, go with the one linked above.  Also, Extech is way better than the twenty dollar unit manufacturers.		I purchased and use the product I linked above.  See my Amazon Verified Purchase there.
0,Works great and looks durable!
0,Worked perfect
0,This is an excellent product.  Doesn't spray Windows.  Cheaper here than at pool store.
0,As I can tell by "zap" sounds, it kills a lot of bugs at night.	Most of them are not mosquitos though, and I bought it to get rid of mosquitos.	Also cleaning is complicated, you can't get to the electric wires, to which all dead bodies are attached to, will try doing it with electric fan as their instruction suggests.
0,Wonderful!  We have seven tomato plants in there and the flower starts I am getting ready to plant.  Great workmanship and easy to set up. First summer we have had it.  We take our greenhouses down in late fall....depending on weather of course.
0,The purchase of this 4 cycle blower has completed my transition of all lawn equipment from 2 cycle to 4 cycle. (The 4 cycle trimmer reviewed elsewhere has proven to be a real gem.)		The @#$#@ ethanol now in the gasoline simply drives one to move away from 2 cycle. Combine the up to 10% ethanol diluted gas with 2 cycle oil and the life of the diaphrams in the carb - as well as the fuel line itself - is appreciably shortened. My 2 cycle engines used to last 6-7 years with only plug and filter changes. With the level of gasohol now, getting two years of use without a carb rebuild is about it.		Now to this blower.  This unit easily went from box to assembled &  running smoothly in about 5 minutes. Half of that time was spent observing the unique (and embarassingly sub par) "dip stick" in the oil filler. Makita engineers should really be embarrassed with this "mickey mouse" way of checking the oil in a seemingly otherwise pretty fine unit.		Other reviewers have commented about the air intake on the left which sucks in your trousers if you are right handed. It definitely does, but that is not that big an issue to me. Some have also mentioned the crankcase fill but this is not all that bad either  - but you do need to tilt the unit to get the oil to run down into the little crankase properly. Do not fill unit laying flat on its side! The primer bulb is tucked underneath farther than you would normally expect but operates as it should so no real problem there either.		The unit assembles & starts easily and runs like a champ. Quieter and just as much power as my past 2 cycle models of similar engine size - but admittedly at 3 times the price. If the durablity is as expected - and trouble free - then I'll be well satisfied not to be mixing gas & oil any longer or rebuilding carbs, replacing fuel lines.		PROS: Easy assembly, fast start, plenty of power for homeowner use, no mixing gas & oil.		CONS: Pretty expensive for a hand held blower of this size. Very poor quality "dip stick" for checking oil. The diagrams in the manual are pretty crude as well. Would help if you have prior experience with small engines.		Will update after a reasonable period of use. Here in Florida we have to do yard work nearly year round so hours will run up quickly. (PS - Would recommend that you seek out a marina or one of the few gas stations that offer unleaded gas without ethanol for your small engine fuel. It is more expensive but far better for your small engine - and worth it.)
0,Very good I have used it on five succulent plant that I have under growlights, I would recommend!.
0,Planted 140 seeds -- 100% germination within 6 days!  I am really looking forward to a bountiful harvest.  I love, love, love David's Garden Seeds.  Excellent quality heirloom, non-GMO seeds, quick delivery, beautifully packaged, excellent instructions. I had the same excellent results with cherry tomatoes I got from him last year.  I had so many tomatoes from four plants that I could share with three families and have enough to dehydrate for tomato paste.  David sells a good product.
0,We used this when we moved and had a new koi pond dug.  It worked great - which we expected from microbe lift.
0,This really took off and grew fast.  It loves light and even grows toward the LED lights deck lights at night.
0,Very happy with this product. It matches the humidity indicator on my humidifier, so apparently both are working correctly.
0,Any experienced chain saw user should have no trouble getting this saw to perform up to any reasonable expectation.  It's meant to be a light tree trimmer, and it does that very well.
0,They work good. A lower profile than my favorites. I planted tomatoes in a self watering setup and beat the ground planted plants by 2 weeks or more.
0,Nice, durable cover.
0,Excellent humidity dome! The indents in the bottom plus the top vents make for the perfect environment if you're germinating seeds. If you're growing clones, this might be a bit too short.
0,Works in my Weber grill. I replace them about twice a year.
0,These lights were easy to install, and provide quite bright illumination. Good value.
0,I planted these indoors and on a heating pad. 9 out of 10 seeds sprouted. I cannot find these locally so these are really great so far!
0,Reasonable price and good delivery
0,Bought this item to create a planter out of it--punched holes in the bottom, filled with soil and now have a good crop growing. Perfect for tomatoes, lettuce, herbs, whatever. Overall, construction is good and it looks great in my yard. May have to buy a few more of these! Much cheaper than a planter of equivalent size.
0,nice piece
0,I only used it once, but I can tell you that it was good at both storing gasoline and splashing gasoline around.  Whereas other, lesser, gas cans have not done the trick for me, this gas can really allowed me to get things done.
0,Received in good condition.
0,great price
0,This makes our Haunted graveyard look much better
0,No berries yet but so far plants are looking good and healthy
0,Excellent service and product!
0,Great Price for a great product.
0,I picked up this device to increase humidity in a oyster mushroom chamber.  It comes on twice an hour for 5 minutes at a time and raises the humidity a lot, it's very effective.
0,Great price. Spa store charges 2x the price
0,Erin go Braugh
0,This is the best set! I use it for making succulent arrangements and it's so fun! It makes things easier when you have the right tools! The watering bottle leaks
0,I really like this product and how quickly it arrived. Everything matched up to the many positive reviews I read. One issue that is also consistent is the marginal packing. In my case the poor packaging put the wheel crooked after during shipment. I was able to grab it and straighten it but still not quite right. Don't notice it now and thing works great. My benchmark is an electric type which was a problem because it was always shutting off.
0,as always great deal
0,have had six months its taken a beating but still holding up
0,Love these! Seem to be made well, don't blow off in wind or storms, and really protect my chairs! A + I would buy them again.
0,Got this as a gift for my mom and she loved it!
0,Good fit. It's not the best design from the factory but this part works just fine
0,works great
0,Easy to grow. It grew nice big flowers
0,Great
0,This is a nice flag, double sided. The colors are vibrant and it hangs nicely on the stand we purchased separately. We haven't encountered any high winds since we've had it, but so far it stays put and doesn't blow around and get tangled up.
0,Very nice fire glass. We have a round fire pit that used to have lava rock.  We ordered the cobalt blue reflective glass. What a difference!! We used 70 pounds of glass, but well worth the money. Buy this glass. You won't be disappointed.
0,As a horseman, I have successfully used dozens of these at my stables to kill millions of flies.  Do not get the "regular" size of this same fly-trap.  Instead, only purchase this "Big Bag" fly trap.  I hang three bags together, so that the stinky smell attracts flies from all directions.  Make sure that you hang the fly-traps in partial shade and avoid full sun.  I purchase the full box of Rescue Fly-Traps because it is much cheaper than purchasing them one at a time at a local store (at full retail price).  I use two boxes per summer at my stables....and so tens of thousands of flies do not infect my Registered Arabian horse.  Do not use other kinds of fly traps, wherein the flies can escape.  This clever design is an inverted cone.  The flies are attracted to the stinky smell, enter the top of the cone, then descend into the bag, then panic and buzz around frantically, and cannot figure out how to escape in the narrow tip of the cone.  The flies die from exhaustion, rather than direct poison.  This clever trap is environmentally correct, since there is no poison..... the stinky smell lures them into the inverted conical trap.  In hot weather, you will need to periodically add more water, so that the trap continues to work effectively.  After the fly-trap is completely full, simply unhook it from the hanging wire, and properly dispose of it inside a empty (used) feed bag....and replace it with another.  This type of trap is effective during fly-season, hot days from April through October in California.  This will be variable to the climate zone where you live.  You will need malleable (bendable) wire to hang it (like bailing wire).  I have tried many kinds of fly-traps at my stables, but this model is the most effective, and the very best.
0,Just what I wanted
0,Kills the tough stuff faster and better than standard Round Up.
0,Very satisfied
0,What is there to say, love it
0,One broke after several uses. Works great on moles and if you have a chipmunk problem. Just bait with sunflower seeds
0,Great with kids around campfire roasting dogs and marshmallows.
0,Looks like a tough cover that should last
0,a little thin but cut good
0,good
0,It took 2 min. Super easy. Were renters so we were trying hard to not make things worse
0,this last about 2 to 3 years as we run pool year round. Will order again in about 2 years so I can have on hand when this one quits.
0,The spindle assembly works well.
0,Perfect for garden beds.  I have chickens, and I have a front garden bed.  I put these around all the bushes and larger plants, and they keep the chickens from digging up the roots.  You can easily trim with scissors to make the center hole larger, or to fit near a wall.  Just enough protection for this purpose.
0,Bought as a gift for replacement canopy.  It's alittle larger than needed but works and they are very happy with it.
0,This hummingbird feeder is very beautiful, it's just as described and the hummers love it. The glass is heavy and thick and the collar is metal. This feeder should last for years.
0,Fantastic item for grilling small and thin vegetables
0,Works great. Make sure you put change on before use.  Chain oil has very small resorvor so keep eye on it.  Also make sure it's cap on tight I lost it once and oil came out.	Easy to us.
0,Well got this unit last week.  Now up and running I think it is a great unit.	The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when I got it just sitting on my counter the temp was off and wind was 9 MPH. After reviewing I switched the channels removed and replaced the batteries,and after about 2 hours I finally going. Get the right combination and works well.  Just takes lots of time and  frustration to get it going.
0,Exactly what I wanted .performs very well.
0,Fit my 021 perfect, even the extension for the adjustment screws. It was a little tight, but it did fit the screws. Idle was high as hell once adjusted it ran great
0,This is my third blade. I have pretty tough grass in my country landscape, and am not very tentative on using my clipper on weeds, etc. Likes: Width is nice, lasts over one season, the clipper and blade serves the purpose perfectly for me. I HATE weed-wackers. Dislikes: It is hard to have professionally sharpened, is fairly difficult to find, and I'd like for it to stay sharp longer than just over one summer, due to the cost. Would I buy it again? Well, I've bought two others, and plan to rotate them around. Not crazy over all of this attention given to blades, but not crazy over the alternatives, either.
0,I'm trying this product out on my pool for the first time.  I poured a cap full in the skimmer as the instructions said.  I will see if the algae start to disappear.  I noticed the pool looked clear after using the Pool Perfect + PhosFree.  I'll have to keep an eye on how balanced the pool remains.
0,very GOOD
0,Works well
0,Ive bought this several times. Its far cheaper than what is sold at my local Pool supply store and it works fast and great! It does appear a little bubbly for a bit after you put it in but thats quickly gone. Works like a dream every time.
0,It has a nice sound without being annoying and is good for using in an unprotected area.
0,Nice and strong.
0,Great flag !
0,Awesome!!!
0,Looks to be made of good quality material although you can't see what's inside.
0,All were good except for one. We received about fourty-five bulbs. As they are out of season I am not so picky. I am glad to get them.
0,Colors are sharp and correct.  Workmanship is of very high quality.  They shipped fast, too.
0,fits in the small space in my yard well constructed easy to put together
0,Love, love, love this hose, long and lightweight easy to handle.
0,Real sticky.
0,Could not use my oven w/o it
0,Easy to set up and good directions
0,My butterflies loves this plant and I can't wait to get more of these next year. Fast shipping and love the surprise gift
0,It is as good as possible be - a battery powered blower.	Our  number 1  blower is a corded  for heavy wet stuff.  For every day  cleanup around the draway  this is the blower that we are using. Don't expect more from a battery powered unit.  Plenty of airflow, 400 cfts;  that what you need  not the speed for everyday use.	For wet stuff, yes you need the speed also, - a corded one-  but that is overblowing the leafs in dry days  to the neighbors, and we are just chasing the leafs from everywhere to recollect them.
0,Great trimmer
0,I have 2 beetle traps hanging about 2 feet apart.  They are very similar in design but very different in effectiveness.		The Bag-A-Bug trap by Spectacide has a single scent attractor.  I bought this trap a few weeks ago at a local hardware store.  I was looking for a new scent card for my old trap and this was only $1 dollar more for the whole trap than just a replacement scent card.  Im very disappointed in this trap and would NOT recommend buying it.		The Beetle Bagger trap by Bonide has a slightly brighter yellow deflector and has a dual scent attractor.  This trap was bought last year and at the end of the year I taped over the backside of the scent attractor card and stored it for the winter.  I was afraid the scent would be too weak to work a second season but it is out producing the new trap by at least 5 times even with a 1 year old scent attractor.  My only complaint is the bags split at the side seams.  I used packing tape to repair them.  In fairness I think the bags are supposed to be disposable and I have been rinsing them out and reusing them.  I highly recommend this product.		Both traps have a problem in that the narrow part of the bag (at the bottom of the funnel part) likes to self-close.  I taped a wire twist tie to the outside of the bags and that provides a little support to keep the bag open so the beetles fall freely into the bottom.  I saw on the web where some people have put a zip-tie loosely around the outside of the narrow part to help keep it open.
0,These expandable hoses are so awesome. I received one of these 50 Foot Expandable Hoses from Ohuhu to reveiw and I love the quality. This one features brass connections that make it great when connecting to the metal threads of the spigot. I had one of these that had plastic ends and while the hose was good, those threads broke down really quickly. The included sprayer features nine spray patterns for different type jobs. When empy, the hose is super light and can be carried with one hand. When filled with water it is easy to manage and does not kink up. The hose expands to 50 feet, giving you the length to walk around or get to the area you need to go, while still having fabulous pressure for the powerful sprat patterns on the spray nozzle.	A little care needs to be taken with these type hoses. They shouldn't be left outside to be exposed to the elements when not in use. They should also not be drug over surfaces or objects that can rip the outer fabric or punture the hose inside. And unlike vinyl hoses, because of the expanding capacity of these, they will burst if you close the valve at the nozzle end, but leave the water on at the spigot. It's worth it to me to exercise a little bit of care because I genuinely like the hose and want it to last. This hose has worked out great for me and I like the way it functions.
0,My saltwater pool went from a brownish green to crystal clear in 48 hours!
0,I have had a La Crossee Wireless Indoor/Outdoor temperature station for 10 years. When it died, I ordered this temperature station. I really like the large numbers for the outdoor temperature on the top and the smaller numbers for the indoor temperature below. You can switch the numbers so that the indoor temp. is on the top and the outdoor temp. is on the bottom. This was very easy to set up and use right away. I highly recommend this temperature station.
0,Had to modify it to fit...but works great!
0,I actually use this for pork belly making bacon.  I went from only fitting 4 full bellies in my smoker to 6!  Can't beat that!
0,This product broke the first time we used it. It is a bit thin for the metal rod. However, the company stood behind the product and replaced it. I did an entire wheel barrel full of large dandelions last summer without a glitch. I like the added cover for the tips for storage. Please note, this should only be used in ground that is semi-soft soil or after a rain.
0,It's perfect. But, it's little small for indirect cooking such as beer can chicken. One big side effect is it's impossible to lose weight with this :)
0,I bought this to as an add on to get free shipping on an order. I never thought I would use it. I ended up needing it I got a hose from walmart that didn't include a gasket and I put this one in there and it works great no leaks!
0,Great size for small gardeners.....easy to assemble
0,Planted these late in the season, so will need to watch how many grow when rains begin. I will review again when I find out.
0,These are not the standard hose end gasket. they are designed for the GILMOUR quick connector.
0,This garden fence has a great design and it is sturdy.  A lot of garden fences seem to be flimsy, but this one is exactly what I was looking for.
0,good fit for honda.
0,Work great. Don't like that the green color comes off in your hands and is hard to get off, but still glad I got them
0,No deer, so far.
0,Loves this thing!  I was pleasantly surprised when I received the box from Amazon.  The first thing I noticed was the weight of the product.  Upon opening the box, I realized that the weight was consistent with the well made cover.  It was everything the listing described!  Extremely satisfied!
0,The bait stations are great for our voles.
0,As expected. Best product to KILL nutgrass!
0,Excellent product!
0,One was the correct size.
0,Cute
0,works great, easier than the old models. But winter time will tell... had the other models(with the push down tops) mess up on me last winter... but they made it 2 seasons.... will see how long these last
0,As advertised
0,This trimmer has surprising power. It chews right through very thick grass and does a nice job.		I give it five stars for performance, but two for design.		The power receptacle is in a very awkward location and getting the power cord in and out is tougher than it should be.		The second problem was no doubt a preemptive response the the U.S. legal system. The ON-OFF switch on top of the handle must be reengaged each time you let off the trigger. This is a PITA but is easily fixable by super gluing the switch to the ON position.
0,This works great against bees. My only gripe is that it smells very strongly of mint, and if you use it to kill a bee inside that smell will linger for awhile.
0,Works great for keeping trash out of my hot tub and pool. Very easy to clean. Love it.
0,Great grill cover  and less then anywhere else
0,Perfect fit and function.
0,All in one weather station that was easy to install and fun to keep track of your weather and not your local airport miles away. So far its been working fine, seems accurate compared to local forecast and other thermometers, but haven't had any rain since purchasing because it doesnt rain in the desert that often, but cant wait until it does.
0,Fast shipping!  Love these bamboo water spouts to make your own fountains!  Can't wait to set this one up in the Spring.
0,Good product.  I just received the product earlier this week and had no issues installing the front door and top gasket seal.  However, installing the bottom lid gasket is tricky and I wouldn't anticipate it holding for long.  This is in part due to the nature of the WSM design.  The bottom opening of the cylinder does not have a large horizontal lip like the top of the cylinder. As such, this will eventually lead to the gasket slipping out of place.
0,This float worked ok for 31 days, and they said the warranty was ran out after 30 days. (WoW)	The float just keeps running, causing the water to overflow.	I am disappointed with the companies policy toward the customer.	I bought a new one and I am very happy with it.
0,This snowblower worked great on the sidewalks and even used it on the roof!	The snow has to be fresh, not turned to ice.
0,Work well
0,I just love this smoker. It makes the best smoked salmon. A great way to impress your friends with your cooking and smokeing skills.
0,arrived by due date.	fit just right no adjustments.	will buy again .
0,This product is supposed to suppress regrowth on cut trees and shrubs. I've used it on the former hedge that was around my property when I bought it. After it was originally cut, it started to grow back. So now I'm waiting to see if it's gone for good this time. Wish me luck. It's easy to apply where needed, and not kill other plants.
0,My favorite style of hummingbird feeder but I'm not sure why it has multiple ports as only one feeds at a time.
0,Review of:		Greenworks 14inch Cordless string trimmer 40V 4Ah Battery & Charger included #21363		Yesterday morning my Greenworks battery powered weed eater arrived. With the help from JJ (my dwarf pit) I opened the box and got the weed eater out and all parts. Assembly was pretty easy as all one had to do was put on the weed guard and the handle. But before even that I put the 40volt 4ah battery on to charge. I already had a 40volt 2ah and charger from the Greenworks 12 inch chainsaw I bought a few weeks ago. That is already reviewed on Amazon. For the first charge it took about an hour.	While waiting on it to charge I looked around the house and in the shed for some safety glasses. All I could find was my wifes shooting range glasses. They would work just fine but I bet I looked stunning sporting safety glasses with pink rims. LOL!	In case you are wondering why I am slowly converting what I can afford of outdoor work tools over to battery power versions I am tired of the pull pull pull yank pull pull pull of trying to get the Ryobi powerhead to start. I have to admit that I do work the poor Ryobi hard as I have an acre of land. And since I have all the attachments the powerhead fulfills the job of weed eater, pole saw, blower, and cultivator/mini tiller. But, I have to buy a new one just about every season. So, this season I am over it and my rebuilt shoulder is over it because by the time I get the dern thing running and staying running my shoulder is already singing. So, that is why I finally got desperate enough to try out the supposedly better more powerful battery class yard tools.	I took it outside and to the front of the house and looked dubiously at the span of high weeds that were standing about 2 foot tall. They had not been weed whacked since mid last season as I hate weed eating with a passion. All the vibration from gas powered weed eaters really hurts the shoulder.	The first thing I noticed that this Greenworks is HEAVY. Please let no reviewers tell you otherwise. There is no getting around the fact it is heavy. Just as heavy as the Ryobi powerhead with an attachment. Also note that NO shoulder strap came with my Greenworks unit.	The Power:	But back to the point. The weeds were there giggling and laughing at me with my brand new battery operated weed eater showing no fear. It was such a blessing to be able to just push the power button, squeeze the safety trigger and pull the regular trigger and it fired RIGHT UP! Holy Cow! I am NOT exhausted and angry before I even start a job! The weeds however were not impressed as there were so many of them. I pushed the other button and it went to High setting and it really sped up and sounded powerful. The weeds took notice and I think I saw them start to tremble with a little fear. Feeling more confident I went to work. Oh the slaughter of the weeds!!!! How horrible! (from the weeds perspective) As for me I was grinning like a maniac working from the top down. This thing was doing what it is supposed to do. Weed Eating! Now to be fair the weeds did not have any woody ones to beef them up. I had pulled all that during the winter. But they were still masses of them and laid in thick. They did not stand a chance.	The Bump head:	When it came time that I needed more line I whispered a little prayer. NO bump head I have ever used worked properly. NONE. That always forced me to use a 3rd party head that you insert cut line into. I did a light tap on the ground and holy cow it worked! Color me impressed!	The Vibration:	Yes, it has vibration. BUT, and I say BUT! It is no where near as bad as a gas powered unit. My shoulder, arms, and hands, said THANK YOU very much!	The Balance:	I had no problem with the balance of the Greenworks unit. I am 5' 6 and it felt fine to me.	Battery Life:	I kept it on High setting for about 25 minutes before stopping because I wanted to save something for a video review I am planning to do. Battery was still running it.	Noise level:	After about 15 minutes of run time my daughter in law came around front. I was able to hold a conversation with her while working. With a gas powered unit that is impossible. No, it is not whisper quiet. But you can still talk with out shouting your head off and filling the conversation with a bunch of WHATS?	Attachment abilities:	The reason the DIL came round was she had been busy herself along with the grand kids. That is also why I called a halt to the weed assault after just 25 minutes. I went around the side of the house and she had been busy cleaning and straightening up. She wanted me to blow the masses of dead leaves that had gathered on the side of the house all winter. I went to the shed and brought out the Ryobi Expand-It blower attachment. It went on and clicked and tightened down with zero problem. (after the job was done I tried all the Ryobi Expand-It attachments I had and they all fit) With the blower attachment on and the setting still on High I went to work. It was blowing a ton of weeds with a wet bottom layer around with zero problem.	Battery Life/run time High of 4ah battery continued:	After about five minutes the battery gave up the ghost. So that gives the battery a total of about 30 minutes on High setting with most of it being in high weeds. Not bad. Next time I weed whack I will not need the high setting.	I went in and put the 4ah on the charger and brought out the 40volt 2ah battery I had from the chainsaw. Fit perfect. I finished the blowing of the leaves to out in the yard. Then the DIL wanted a turn with the weed eater attachment. So I switched back over and she took a tentative turn getting bolder as she used it. She went about five minutes and declared it good saying she would be able to use it. She is about 5' 3. (please don't giggle there are no giants on either side of either family) The only thing she did not like was the weight. She to was hoping it would be lighter.		Over all impression:	With the weight and no shoulder strap being the only downfall I was really impressed with what this thing could do and very happy that I had to buy no separate yard tool attachments as the Ryobi Expand-It attachments do fit perfectly. I am so impressed that when I can afford it I will be adding another 40volt 4ah battery to the arsenal (one acre peeps) and also am heavily considering the 19 Greenworks battery powered push mower. That is the long range goal as money allows.	As for the longevity of these yard tools and batteries? I am sorry at this time I can not attest to that. We shall see. But currently really love both the chainsaw and this Weed eater even more.		Actual rating: 4.5 stars. Dinged half a star because of the weight. But if you are sitting on the fence about buying this product. Hope off the fence and go on and buy it. I think that you to will enjoy it. Well, as much as one can enjoy yard work. :)		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Greenworks-14-Inch-40V-Cordless-String-Trimmer-Attachment-Capable-4-0-AH-Battery-Included-21362/dp/B00IPA151K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Greenworks 14-Inch 40V Cordless String Trimmer (Attachment Capable), 4.0 AH Battery Included 21362</a>
0,Best "shrinking hose"  in the Market for the price.  The only negative is that , since I purchased 2, they cannot be connected due to the inability to remove the nozzle.
0,Great buy, they work perfect, top quality
0,This is a amzing trimmer. Extremely powerful for a battery powered trimmer. No reason to touch my large john deer trimmer, this thing cuts even the thickest weeds and grass.
0,after few years, still work good	no leak so far, and reel action still smooth.	light weight alu metal, but help up so far with light use.	no issue with corrosion so far.
0,Having way too. Much fun with this...
0,My charcoal grill actually takes a 22" grate but I seldom use that much space so I bought this 18" and simply put it on top of the larger one and grill. It's a much cheaper replacement ( my large grate was rusting and shot ) and because I spray it with canola oil before I use it cleaning is easy ( the grate fits in the top rack of the dishwasher perfectly ).		 I saved money buying the 18"and I save time putting it in the dishwasher for cleaning after each use. Is that a no-brainer or what?
0,Absolutely great blades. After I replaced the ones on my Cub Cadet riding mower I mowed the property and wow what a noticeable improvement in cutting.
0,perfect
0,A little larger than I expected, but happy so far.
0,Davis weather equipment is highly reliable and functional.  The recently purchased Anemometer  replaces an 8 yr. old unit that had become clogged with dust from constant dry winds in east central New Mexico, my location.  Installation of the new has been completed and the unit is up and working as designed.  I have used Davis weather equipment for years without any reliability problems.  I can highly recommend their equipment.
0,Works great, sticks well to the window. Birdseed doesn't get moldy or gross after rain.
0,Great product.
0,I have a ridiculous amount of leaves in my yard. I can't find a local leaf removal service and decided to give this a try. It's awesome! The box says that it shreds 16:1. I would say that's accurate. It makes it much easier to dispose of- either by compost or bagging. You have to be careful of twigs. Very small ones will shred. I think it's worth the use I will get out of it. Hopefully I will put a dent into the never ending leaves in my yard.
0,seed in the spring
0,These are very well made birdhouses at a GREAT price. I wouldn't or couldn't pay those ridiculous prices for a cedar birdhouse but this one is perfect. I have one exactly like it and have had bluebirds nesting each year so I thought a friend and I would add a few more. Pennington is a name I trust for feed and houses both and these are very well made. My bluebirds seem happy enough, they are repeat customers to my bird house motel each year. It has faded a bit in the weather but is still as strong and door opens well to clean it and cedar is so tough! Great birdhouse!
0,completely satisfied
0,FINALLY  AFTER USING A LUBRICANT NOT DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE, i FINALLY THE RIGHT ONE.
0,I needed a small table next to our outdoor table to hold incidentals and this works perfectly.  It's a sturdy little piece and it's short enough the I can place it under the table during inclement weather etc.  Assembly is super simple & the stand is smooth so I don't have to worry about it snagging the tablecloth.  My only note is that I'd probably classify this as a stand rather than a cart - the "wheels" are welded to the frame.  That said, it is small enough that it's easy to pick up and move whenever you would like.
0,Grass is getting greener after a couple of months (5/2015).		(03/2016)  We have a lot more grass this year than last year and the shaded side of our house is growing grass. For the past several years we have had mud no grass in the shaded area until now. So far this product is a great product but it is a little pricey.
0,Slow results, but I'll keep watching
0,Great
0,Not much to say other than works great for keeping edges and weed liner in place, really strong and the right length.
0,These are my FAVORITE snips to use for gardening and floral design. Very easy to manipulate and precise, quick cutting of smaller stems. Fits in a back pocket easily. Unless I am pruning larger woody shrubs and trees, this is what I exclusively use.  Inexpensive, and stays sharp- I stock up when they are around $13-$15 so I can have one in my purse, car, a few out in the shed... etc.  You do NOT need Felcos unless you only want one pair of pruners to baby for your whole life.
0,Does the job just fine.
0,Best Rake Ever!!!
0,The product arrived on time and well packed. I have noticed since switching from the old product that I had to dilute to Electro Nectar I have a lot more hummingbirds using the feeder.
0,Needed it
0,Weber factory parts as good as original. Fits perfectly in my 2009 Weber Spirit E-210.
0,Only use when vegging.  Stop using this silicon additive a week before you change your light schedule.  Just think of it this way.  Silicon gives the stems/leaves flexibility and heat and frost protection.  But once you are growing the part you will be consuming (not stems/leaves) then you don't want it growing tacking on silicon (for you to eat/smoke).  Even with amazing flushing the silicon will remain.  Do not use when near flowering.  Use only to get your plants healthy and stocky and protected and then quit!
0,easy to read
0,Just as described. Thank you!
0,This has been care free. The only thing why I didn't give it 5 stars is that the green hook up to the tank will leak unless it is connected ever just so. It needs 2 or 3 tries to get it right.
0,This waterfall spillway is great, just real expensive for what you get. I was originally going to try and find a plastic parts bin, like the kind that go on racks in a warehouse or electronics manufacturer's production area, etc. But I couldn't find any that were big enough, or that you could buy as a single instead of having to buy a bulk pack of 12, etc.	There is a two piece, 3-step inlet on this spillway that enters the rear wall at the bottom. The 3 step inlet has a male thread on the other end that passes through the wall of the spillway, then another piece threads on to that on the inside that diverts the water downward so you don't get a bubble-over effect from the pressure of your pump. Two rubber washers are included to sandwich the spillway wall, creating a leak-proof seal.
0,It's beautiful and I love the gentle sound.  I have it in the house near a ceiling fan - I wouldn't recommend using it outside in strong winds.  It's rather delicate - really a great indoor wind chime.
0,Excellent.
0,good buy
0,Really Really Nice....
0,Terrific feeder! Fill it with black oil sunflower seeds and watch the birds flock in!
0,used for grilling and cooking but also used to open tight jar lids.  Wish I had gotten this sooner.  seller had good communication.
0,Good price. Fast shipping
0,I am so pleased with how this arbor looks in my garden! My small flag doesn't get all wrapped-up on it the way it does on my other holders. I shall start replacing them with this one, for sure! It is nice and sturdy as well. It shipped quickly, and for sure, was in a huge box! I laughed when I saw it, but hey, it was well protected! Recommend highly.
0,as expected
0,Perfect fit and half the price of my local vender.  I am very satisfied and will make future purchases.
0,Great
0,This thermometer is awesome. It has an oversize face that also glows in the dark. I only deducted a star because you cannot adjust it. All thermometers will be/become slightly off temp. An adjustment screw would make this thermometer one of a kind. Still a great buy and good addition to grills/smokers.
0,Item is CARB Compliant and said to be made of break-resistant material.  Rode home from the village gas station with this newly filled 2.5 gallon can: no fumes and no spillage.  Will be curious to learn how this poly gas can handles the extreme New England winter weather temperatures.  Amazon had the best online price for this gas can; but, based on cost of its readily available simple materials and its manufacturing process, it is rather expensive.
0,Wow! There were more plants than I could handle. I was not used to Hornwort, and so this was far too much for two 15 gallon aquariums. In all honesty, I could not tell where one plant ended and where the other one started...it's just a huge mass of green. It's not a particularly  "pretty" plant for an aquarium, but if it adds a lot of oxygen, I'm all for that, especially since I have Goldfish. This is far better suited for a pond, not an aquarium, and the description clearly says that, too. Be sure to rinse off well before you put it into your tank if you are going to put some of this in your aquarium. When I rinsed it off, there were a LOT little pieces or "leaves" that went all over the place. They would have really fouled my aquarium had I not rinsed the plant off well first. Another plus, Goldfish leave this plant alone!
0,Excellent hangers, easy to use.
0,none
0,The chain is sharp and works great.
0,This is a pretty neat grill.  It's a good size - large enough to cram a bunch of food on, but small enough for camping or otherwise keeping in the car in most situations.		Although grills without open flame are never quite as good, the propane is at least better than electric, and you really can't have open flame leaking grease all over this thing, or it would reek up your whole car for the rest of the trip.  A good compromise, I think.  Well done.
0,works perfect
0,You get a lot of straw.  Just recently open it to cover an area in my lawn that I had just seeded.  I barely made a dent in package and I thought i had spread quite a bit.
0,Even though this blade has a square mounting hole it fits perfectly.  Don't worry about it not fitting properly.  Cuts as it should.
0,This flipper is well built and well designed, but I don't really care for it.		I would have preferred a wooden handle and a loop string on the handle to hang it from a grill. I like to let my grill tools sit over high heat after cooking (to sanitize), but I'm afraid the rubberized handle will melt on this one.		It is quite long - any longer and it could be too hard to use. 3 stars based on personal preferences and price.		edit: uptraded to 4 stars	after 3 long years of use, it's still holding up. dirty, stained....but still solid. the rubber handle has not melted as I had feared, but I am careful to not put it too close to the heat. I fashioned my own string loop to hang it with. this is made of thick steel and it won't bend or break under normal use. I still don't care for the shallow angle that the flipper is at in relation to the handle, but that's just a personal preference thing
0,This repellent works quite well. I had more chances than I wanted to test it on me and my family this summer, as we stayed near a wooded lakeside in Maine. It only seems to repel from the exact places it's put on. In other words, don't put it on your hat or your face, and think it'll keep skeeters off your neck. However, it does work where it's placed.		As for "dry" -- well, not really. It is a lot less sticky than the earlier, grosser, tackier sprays. Overall less disgusting, certainly. "Dry" is a bit of an exaggeration. But it's an improvement I'm glad to have. Insect repellents are a necessary evil, so the less horrid they are, the better.
0,Sturdy.
0,I bought this last year and used it on my walkway and driveway. Then i decided that this cost a lot and will just use it on my concrete walkway for now. Seems at low temps it took awhile to melt ice on my driveway. I have grass edge to edge on my walkway and have had no issues on my grass. I have a lawn company address my lawn issues so it is even green in the winter time so not sure if that helps me out.
0,They are the perfect size to clean the flowers/entry ways of our hummingbird feeders.  They are a little expensive, but they are worth it.
0,This larger storage box needed a bit more directional assembly drawings!! after a few attempts and one miffed husband, we ignored the directions and just used good old yankee ingenuity and logical thinking to snap this together. Well worth the effort!
0,good quality for my chickens
0,great.....Beautiful color!
0,The drip pans are economical and are a great fit between the charcoal baskets when I rotisserie a chicken on my weber kettle grill.  No greasy mess to clean up afterwards - just toss the pan in the garbage.
0,We live in the California foothills with a greenbelt right behind our property.  We get tons of raccoons as well as deer and skunks in our yard.  The raccoons do a lot of damage to our garden and plants.  I can't tell you how many costly begonias I've lost to the little devils.  Nothing worked.  So this year I decided to try something new and I got three of these.  Well, knock on wood, we have had amazing good luck this year with our yard and plants.  Then the other night I unplugged one of the sensors because I was trying to get our cats to come in and they don't like the noise.  I forgot to plug it in and within one day the raccoons had been back and created havoc all over our back lawn.  So tonight I will plug it in for sure!!!  But that was definitely the proof that it is these things are helping keep the bandits away!  Thanks so much, yard sentinel!  Oh, and we use urine as well, as a secondary barrier.
0,I like the unlock idea on this you can use one hand to open it and use or to close.
0,Good quality product!
0,perfect for my permanent companion gardening beds...asparagus, oregano, and basil  :)
0,I like to add this to my spa and item was a great price, arriving on time and just as advertised.
0,awesome unit
0,It fit and was delivered on time.  Looks good and material is very heavy.  Time will be the real test.
0,So cute. A little smaller than I thought but love it. Have inside for the winter and will put on patio next spring.
0,Works just like it should.
0,worked great
0,I need a trap for armadillos and bought one for $29.99 at the national "freight" liquidator chain that sells cheap tools.  It didn't work at all, three times the armadillo was trapped and it pushed the door up far enough to escape.  The Havahart is designed differently and appears to be strong enough to do the job.  I'll update this review after I've had more experience with.
0,Can't beat the deal here if you have the many rebadged Ryobi, Homelite, etc string trimmers.
0,Just what the mower dr ordered...
0,The flag, pole, and the eagle on the top are great. However the pole holder is a piece of junk!!! It bent in half with the first wind gust. I had to order a cast aluminum holder. Very strong now!!!
0,I've had to keep these covers on very expensive patio furniture out on my driveway (pending completion of construction) for almost a year now. They are very well made, tight, and have protected the furniture beautifully in all types of severe weather! I am so very happy I have these covering two chaises, two slider chairs, two tables, and a loveseat! They're the best!
0,Good socks.  Got my $ worth.
0,Excellent product
0,A good product............
0,I hung it on my apple tree and it attracted finches almost immediately.  They really do prefer socks despite that I have metal finch feeders that I fill daily.  They [refer to hang onto the socks.
0,Great quality better than l expected
0,The panels are well constructed and I am getting rated voltage/current from them. They look great and perform better than expected. The first panels that I received were packaged terribly (from Amazon) and the frames were damaged but Amazon replaced them with next day shipping. The replacements were packaged well and work great. I rated the product and Amazon 5 stars for making good on the damaged panels.
0,Very Heavy Duty.
0,My war with ants is one I cannot win, because my home sits atop a gigantic, interconnected ant colony that stretches for miles along the Northern California coastline.  However, I can keep their numbers down so that they don't come into the house.		Like all Terro ant baits, this TERRO T901-6 ANT KILLER PLUS (3lb. Shaker Bag) is highly effective against ants.  For large outdoor areas, the granules are easier to apply than any of the Terro liquid outdoor ant bait products.  The Plus part of the name means that the bait kills other insects besides ants.  The product is intended to be used as a barrier around your house foundation, along with Terro liquid indoor ant bait stations inside the house as needed.		The bait granules are small, but heavy enough NOT to be picked up by the slightest of breezes (as happens with ant/slug/snail bait in "meal" form).  Because they're small, the granules are easily broadcast with the shaker bag.  There is no need to touch the bait.
0,does not come with enough pegs to hold the entire length, even when spacing 4 feet apart.
0,Birds loved it
0,No Issues
0,This worked perfect on my gas grill.
0,I bought these gourds just before the martins were due to arrive. It didn't take them long to choose these for their nests. They were full in no time. The gourds held up all season and still look new.
0,Worked perfectly! Saved a bundle by troubleshooting and replacing myself!
0,Looks good.  Thread size was a bit off for my flag pole.  Nothing a little teflon tape couldn't fix.
0,I was having algae problems that made my pond very cloudy, all I had to do way put one of these in the pond and let it float around. This product just absorbs the algae and when it gets full you just pull it out and let it dry, then toss it back in. It makes a huge difference. I would highly recommend this product. Just toss it and forget it.
0,My back garden was infested with mosquitoes, and it was not possible to enjoy it in the morning or evening hours. I hung the insect killer in the back garden yesterday afternoon. This morning- no mosquitoes, not even one!!! It was highly effective for the 1/4 acre lot. Packaging excellent, delivery very prompt, received within 2 days! Really pleased.
0,Pleased with quality. The leather used has body. It folds instead of rolls. Nice hand feel. Well made. Lining gives neutral barrier to preserve tobacco. Fits neatly in pocket. Nicely packaged.
0,Perfect cover with great protection.
0,Arrived in good condition AND had a label I use to mark it in the garden
0,Sturdy and love the flur dis lies
0,Quality seed starter.
0,good net!
0,So far so good! It did tip over once but I can't really blame the umbrella. Maybe the base I ordered was too light...?
0,Very heavy duty with nice zip pouch for storing grill brush.  Wish it came in black.  Will update at a year to see if its holding up to the weather.
0,These little babies do the trick. Fungus gnats and thrips beware.
0,this item is a big help..putting togeather isn't bad...don't care for the crank handle so much..wouldn't go in the shorter holes, which would have made it more user friendly in my opinion..over all it is ok..
0,Nice healthy worms. Would recommend Uncle Jims worms.
0,Wonderful little fountain. It works great in my garden and is just the right size for the area I needed to accent. Fast shipping and no damage to the product when it arrived. I'm so glad I got it :)
0,great
0,this works well although it is not quite as powerful as my previous. For electric powered it as more than adequate
0,Came in as expected and growing great.
0,Good decoy for the money. I set it by the pool and it helps
0,Very dependable and reliable unit to trim hedges in my small yard. There is quite a bit of vibration, but this is to be expected. Highly recommend!
0,I like it ok
0,Great gift
0,Good quality seed, haven't noticed any junk mixed in.  The birds seem to enjoy it - can't keep the feeder filled!  When the wild green parrots descend on the feeder, it is total pandemonium.  I would buy this again instead of brands available at my local pet shop.
0,Great product looks like it will last for a while
0,Big hit for our house.  Surprised how fast it grew. Everything you need is included, and there's no waste. The mushrooms grow fast! (Did I already say that).  The mushrooms taste very good too!
0,love it as described
0,Works good.
0,I really like these envelopes for saving seeds. The paper is of high quality and sturdy. The self sealing strip can be reused multiple times.
0,Product comes as described. Would buy again if required.
0,does the job as expected, several attachments if you want specific jobs. Least thing I care for was the size,  I could've gone for smaller
0,Works well, strong.  This will last you like 10 times what a liquid pH down solution would, would recommend.  A teaspoon for me lowers a gallon of water to the right range I need.
0,I only have 2 chickens, so I can't say how well this would work for a whole bunch of them. It gets the job done. My only issue  is that if it is outside and it rains, then the food will get all wet.
0,1 small piece of paper starts it.  Hickory chunks from store work great and give you a deep smoked habachi flavor. I use the ac adapter that came with it.  It also runs on inclided dc adapter or batteries. Watch the video and it works just as they say.  I love this thing.  If i ever get another i think i woud get black next so smoke won't show on it. Don't start the fire too early or you might have to add more wood during cooking. Also don't run the fan on high during cookingand the wood will last longer and smoke better.  Going to add some wet wood chips on top next time and see how that works. This will work well for picnic vacation camping or tailgating.  Still happy after several months use. Runs like a champ. Took on a trip in our rv and grilled out nearly every night. Steaks burgers brats dogs all fire grilled. Fantastic smoke flavor. I use hickory chunks for deep flavor.
0,Seems to do the job
0,Works great.
0,Perfect for starting plants inside in the spring.
0,Wonderful tool for serious gardeners. I've bought this at our local nursery. But this was a better price. Same reliable product
0,Great!!!	Thank you!!!
0,Works fine to hold two hoses together. A bit pricy but she didn't want to just buy a longer hose lol
0,This is one item I re-ordered as soon as it started to diminish, as Mosquito season dawned upon us.  This is a safe way to keep "bugs" at bay, by spraying ones clothing, and hopefully avoiding spraying oneself.  This unit is kept by our front door, and another by the back door, just to keep insects away, during their season.
0,I am so happy with this stool. I wanted one for my greenhouse and this had everything I wanted: water resistant, lightweight, sturdy, drain holes in the seat, a place for your feet, a back, comfort, and it is a very cute shade of blue. I was was worried about the assembly required part, but I only had to put the back on and everything needed for assembly is included.
0,These still look good after being outside for a month. I "planted them" next to pots of Hosta that I plan to transplant soon. The purpose is to deter the rabbits eating my Hostas.
0,Good product
0,This was a great way for the critters to stay away. This worked very well. I haven not seen the possums in weeks. But with all  the rain it does wash away. But I only use a little to hook up to a hose. This will stop them from coming next to my garbage
0,High quality and a very good price.  Mine had to be reshipped, as it was damaged in shipment...no fault of Amazon,and the replacement order was very easy and painless.
0,We have been using no spill cans for many years They are  a must have if you use gas cans very often.
0,We purchased this replacement cover and were pleased to discover that it's not only much lighter than the original, but it fit like a glove, is quite durable, and attractive. It installed easily, too. The neutral color works with any patio or garden color scheme (I think so, anyway).
0,We have enjoyed and it is fairly easy to read from inside house..
0,G.H. great products for the grower
0,Works and looks great.
0,Red aphids started aggressively eating my globe willow tree.  I spread this on the trunk and lower branches.  Within a week, no signs of aphids and new leaf growth on lower branches.  Very happy.
0,Nice size mermaid.  Looks great sitting on antique trunks or a table... pretty heavy for a shelf.  Fits in great with a nautical or seashell/beach theme!
0,An excellent product that is easy to change and easy to clean if it is to be re-used. It is the perfect size to transport food to a party.
0,I was looking at less expensive BBQ's like Char Broil but after comparing the Weber to them (and some advice from friends that made the mistake of going cheap) the choice was clear. I have used it about 10 times now and it heats to over 500 degrees fairly quick and hold heat well. The only thing flimsy on it is the doors the rest is very solid.
0,Works good for cleaning the grill.
0,they sprouted great!
0,Exactly as expected.
0,great product. spendy but worth it. if you want big results its just a few extra dollars away. good luck
0,Great product
0,This replaced a gunked up carb on a STHIL weed trimmer.  Very easy to install, just remove the trim and the old carb, bolt on the new one.  Tuning a two-stroke can be a little tricky.  Three adjustments.  First check the old needles and see how many turns they were set to, turn in until they seat and count the turns.  Then set the same on the new one.  Next start it up at a fast idle.  Set the high speed needle for the best "sound"  As you turn it out run the motor at full throttle it will start to blubber.  Turn in until it just starts to run solid.  Then set the idle adjust for a fast idle.  The low speed is set to where the engine comes quickly off low speed running with a quick throttle jab.  Then set the idle for a good solid idle speed.  Good to go.
0,good
0,I *love* this item. It really works!! I have had it for over 3 months now and it has held up well with washing and drying through this awful winter. It has saved my floors from muddy wet paw prints. I would say to get the large mat its better even for smaller dogs to walk around at bit until their feet are dry.  It does soak up the moisture well. I hope they will make another mat without the paw print so we can have it in the bathroom! After washing and drying one time I used it after showering and it was great! Totally soaked up moisture from my feet.		Some said they had issues with the red dye coming out. I have had no problem with warm washes and no dye leakage.		I think this is a *must have* item not just for a dog!
0,Seems as good as OEM. Thanks Bear
0,This is a good oil and I bought it because of the self measurng bottle. It is easy to squeeze and measure the proper amount for a gallon of gas.
0,work well
0,Works great
0,Flag is made of Nylon material, so I only expect it to last one or two years at the most, but for this price I would expect that. Looks nice on our flagpole. We are in a high wind area so we do go through the flags. At 9 bucks worth it. Will buy again since it will always look new and not faded.
0,Great product.  I would recommend this product.  I would recommend this product.
0,I love this griddle! I make quesadillas on it very often, as well as scallops.
0,Love it!!!  It was so easy to put together and it's wonderful to lay on outside under my big oak tree!!
0,great price, great item, great service
0,only used once on a ham. Produced lots of smoke and flavor in a pit barrel cooker. Amazon gets a little crazy with wanting a review before you recieve the package and a day after getting it. I could do a better review of the product after trying it a couple of times on different cuts of meat.
0,great
0,Fun doormat, always bring out a smile!
0,Never thought I'd be writing a review about mousetraps, but here it is!  VERY impressed with this mousetrap!  Not only does it set quickly (just like opening a clothespin - squeeze, and it stays open), but it releases just as quickly (squeeze and the mouse falls out).  We knew we had mice in our RV - put all 4 of these out, and the next morning we had two plump mice caught.  Love that I didn't have to touch the mouse to get it out of the trap - just opened it over the garbage can into a bag - DONE!
0,Better than expected. Purchased this for small cacti collection. Works perfectly for this. Sturdy. Works well to display small plants.
0,Works great, and seems to be well built.
0,Pump works perfect with my timer, will be purchasing more of these!
0,Great job in our hottub.

0,A REALLY FUN ITEM FOR THE POOL AREA......GOT IT WORKING AND JUST HAD TO SIT AND WATCH THE WATER AND THE LIGHTS....GREAT PURCHASE...GOOD SELLER......
0,This is for the swimming pool this helps keep away leaves bugs etc and it heats up the water from the sun it heats up the water about 10 to 15 degrees more.
0,I love it
0,Perfect size and I like the look.  I especially like that the grillwork is so like metal, yet is rubber.  It will last for years.  What I gave up for all these positives is a way to better remove dirt and leaves from shoes before entering the house.  BUT, I have a rug just inside and that does the job...so a great couple of items when used together.
0,Should work well for getting under the vehicles to wash out the salt this winter.  Going to add a cross piece and a couple wheels to make it east to move around under the car and truck
0,This worked incredibly fast.  I have a bunch of trap-door humane mouse traps which work great on little mice, but this time I had something bigger.  I just threw in Duracell Ultras, tossed in some peanuts, and it worked over night--a little light flashes so you know to take the thing outside and shake.  It would be nice if it came with an optional quiet beeper to let you know it worked.
0,Beautiful, I put some on top of my succulents and it oops amazing. I must order more. Highly recommended
0,Just what I needed it.
0,Really light and sharp! Love them for cutting flowers.
0,Took me a little while to get use to a different brush, but once I did this thing pushes all the dirt on bottom toward the drain. Only problem is it does get heavy once I'm in deep part of pool, so I still like to use a lighter brush in a few areas toward the center of deep end.
0,Assembly on this guy was pretty easy.  I assembled it in the front yard where I had plenty of room and shoved it over the fence to the spot by the pool equipment where it lives.  (It's not too heavy.)  I store my pool chemicals, vacuum hose, etc. in it.
0,Good Product and great value. Combine this with Base A and either Solid Start or Rock Solid depending on your stage of growth. Easy to follow instructions on both the bottle and included in description by Seller. Base A and B with Solid Start for Seedlings- saw new healthy growth on 2 week old seedlings with 24 hours after feeding. Root expansion and stem thickening beyond expectations after 3 days. So far the experience has been great!
0,These still aren't really taking off, but I am hopeful that these will continue in my greenhouse.
0,As advertidsed
0,This is a most appealing patio thermometer to hang on the wall.  It's price is low enough, even those who would be happy to just guess what temperature it is, can have one also.  It is perfect for those hot summer months when the temperature is reading above 88 degrees, as the snowy perch of the two birds in winter plumage, will remind one of how cold it can get in winter and thus can bring some relief.  If only a little solice for you, sitting there on your wicker chair, cold drink in hand, sweating and thinking how cool their little feet must be on the snowy limbs. This thermometer is accurate enough out of the box, at least mine was, to be within one degree of a digital readout, I have nearby and if it does not fall off the the hook it hangs on, it should give a quick assessment of the temperature you are experiencing.  I recommend this bold faced thermometer dial and if you place it correctly, out of the sun and hang it well so the winds will not bounch the light plastic unit it also should work for you.  The front is covered with a plastic face and should last a good long while.  I love mine, so enjoy yours!

0,I really struggled in selecting the right charcoal grill but Weber was always my first choice, just which one?  I have a Weber gas grill that has been my go to for a few years now, but the lack of charcoal and that distinct flavor was always in the back of my mind.  I'm no purest but I do understand those that will not cook on anything other than charcoal.		I don't know how many stores I went to in order to compare these grills but I looked at the Original Kettle, the Master-Touch, Performer, Performer Premium and Performer Deluxe.  I pulled each one out and spent 10 minutes looking at the quality and features of each one.  I finally landed with the Master Touch because it has the right amount of features at the right price, and this is a fantastic grill with some very obvious upgrades that are worth the extra money.  .		The packing of the grill is top notch with quality materials.  The cardboard and plastic bags are just better packing then what I expected and the grill was perfect right out of the box.  Assembling the grill was a breeze but one of the legs was a little difficult to install.  The clip you place in the post opening prior to the leg kept sliding out of the way and would not engage.  I had to spread the clip out a little to give it more "holding power" but the leg went right in.  The engineers at Weber also have a neat little trick for installing the top handle.  The instructions are clear not to over tighten the nut, and they give you a little wrench that slips off the nut when it is just right.  It's that type of attention to detail that is important.		The quality of the grill is outstanding and the upgrades are noticeable.  The handles are all an upgrade in materiel and the top adjustable vent has a plastic handle that makes it easier to change temperature when the grill is smok'n hot.  The side handle has two clips for grilling tools, but I'm not sure how much I'll use those.  The wheel covers are also a nice touch and when you look at this grill you see quality.		The removable aluminum ash catcher may not be very important for grilling, but it sure makes cleaning up a breeze.  Who likes scooping out ashes, not me, and moving the lever back and forth a few times pushes the ashes into the detachable ash pot for easy, mess free disposal.  This was the first time I ever used an ash catcher, but now that I have I'll not go back.		I was on the fence about the Gourmet BBQ system but that in my opinion is the star of this grill and was a must have.  The removable center cooking grate is a nice feature in itself for adding charcoal, and my chimney starter almost fits perfectly.  Regardless how you load the charcoal this insert makes it easier without having to take off the entire grate.  I ordered the sear grate and griddle and used both on the very first test run of the grill.  The sear grate leaves beautiful marks on your meat but I saw other reviews complaining about the sear grate sliding off.  The grate has 4 posts that lock it in place and it did not move at all on my grill.  The sear grates themselves are wider than most and this is a great addition to the collection.  I obviously could not use the griddle and sear grate at the same time so I threw the griddle on Weber gas grill and cooked shrimp in some butter sauce.  I really like the griddle and can't wait to cook some breakfast.  I plan to order the poultry roaster, dutch oven, and maybe the Korean BBQ insert but in my opinion Weber could do a little better job in providing information for this system.  There are multiple inserts not shown on their website including the dutch oven, biscuit and waffle maker just to name a few, but overall the Gourmet BBQ is a must have and I'm very happy I got it.		The grill also came with the Char-Baskets for indirect cooking.  I've not used these yet but appear to be a very nice addition in managing charcoal.  It will keep the charcoal separated and you will not have to reach in and constantly separate charcoal.  I can't wait to use these.		The next step up is the Performer series.  The larger cart with locking casters and the side table is a nice addition, and it has some nice grill tool hooks.  But in my mind the table was just a little too small and these little extra features did not justify the extra $100.  The Performer Premium and Deluxe have larger and nicer tables and other features that really are not needed, and the price jumps $250 and $300.  I just could not justify the extra money and I think the Master-Touch is the perfect grill with the right amount of upgrades.		I wish I could rate myself because I'd give me 2 stars for ordering an off brand cover.  It's nice but not as nice as the Weber covers and I only saved $5.00.  I'll wait a few weeks but eventually I'll order the Weber brand cover.  Don't be cheap!		Anything other than a Weber was just not going to work.  Look at all the grills lined up outside at the local hardware store.  The material is not as nice and the fit and finish is just not there.  You don't see a lot of Weber's sitting outside because they keep the good stuff inside the store.  Weber is the go to grill for quality of material and workmanship and I expect this grill to last me for a long time.		Hope this helps!		I was undecided on the gourmet BBQ system was  .
0,Better than Scotts.
0,This product is well made and had everything that was advertised.  This was designed for a roof mount but I preferred a vertical post mount and they gave me ideas which solved the issue.
0,Good pots, I wish they would sell them for less in larger packages, such as 5 or 10 of them at once. Cloth pots are much better then plastic.
0,This is an awesome self-exploration tool
0,Soooo easy to put together.  Directions were easy to follow.  I have a large greenhouse but I wanted one close to the house to start herb seeds in.  It holds 4 flats. I did do something that was not in the directions.  I used zip ties to secure shelves to the frame.  Made it stronger and more secure.
0,Good replacement but does not last long
0,Great  way to get rid of ant crawling into my hummingbird feeders.  But you have to remember to add water for it to be effective.
0,Love it, easy to install and is great on my rv . I think I may order another one to go with it .
0,Haven't planted it yet. A good product and price however.
0,Works perfectly! This is my first burner like this and the set up was less than a minute and it works exactly how it should. It heated a gallon of vegetable oil to 350 degrees in less time than the stove. I should have bought this years ago!
0,Great product and fast shipping
0,I just ordered 2 more of these feeders. This will be a total of 6 humzinger feeders.  We are having non'stop hummingbird visitors to these feeders.  Other feeders (i.e. the bottle type with flowers with yellow centers) don't get nearly as much hummingbird traffic even though they are itnermixed with the humzingers.
0,Arrived perfect. Only one week old, so far so good
0,Best invention!
0,This is easy to use and seems to be helping my newly planted roses and nursery plants to stabilize.  Miracle Gro is always a good product.
0,works great
0,I've been told that NY mice can eat thru almost anything - except copper. They ate thru the thinly plastered wall under my sink. What a mess!	The copper mesh was fairly easy to handle and cut. Sprayed on the Insulating foam, firmly pushed copper meshing on top, let dry and plastered	(thickly) over top as soon as the Foam had dried.		Looks good and sturdy!
0,this will work great
0,These work good
0,I saw my landscape guy using one of these and had to have one.  it's sturdy, well made and	handles sprinkler work and planting.
0,Great product, seller did right by you me.
0,I have been slowly cutting my trees down due to heavy snows at the wrong time, and this chainsaw saved me from having to borrow or rent one. This way I am assured of the fact this saw has never been used,  and is in relative good shape. Having used gas saws in the past, this saw has exceeded my expectations. It works very well and I shall have it for a very long time, Gas saws are messy and expensive to run, this one works on the same principle only better.
0,Works great
0,This unit works well, allows scheduled watering schedules for each nozzle. The only issue I have with the unit, which some may prefer, is the manual kick off. If I want to kick off both zones for say, 10m each, it will not run one zone for 10m, then the second zone for 10m, it will turn on both zones simultaneously.		As I noted, some may prefer this but this essentially cuts the pressure in half for each zone. Not a deal breaker but I cant kick off a manual watering of both zones and run out, I have to wait for the first to finish, then kick off the second.		This only applies to manual watering. You can program the zones to kick off at different times avoiding this issue.
0,works great
0,Worth every penny. Easy setup and works just as hoped for. I went from an old quirky unit to this and for an irrigation control unit it is really GREAT. Now I never would have expected to say anything about an irrigation unit, but this is just easy and simple and makes life easy. Win
0,WORKS VERY WELL IN THE FALL WITH DRY LEAVES. Not so great with grass. Perhaps adding mulching blades would remedy that.
0,Seeds are sprouting well
0,Very happy with quality and price
0,This is must have equipment for a serious barbeque cook. It eliminates cook temp and food temp guesswork.
0,This is an amazing doormat perfect for the front door.  Many previous reviews stated that they received a sub par mat of a different material.  Please make sure that you are buying products sold by Amazon so you receive the originally advertised product.  The colors are beautfiul and it seems well made.  I believe the colors and design of this mat will hold up a long time.  I am very happy with it and it's the perfect addition to our home!
0,They were falling apart when I went to put them in the soil.....they disintegrated

0,First I have to say that this is my first reel mower, so I have nothing to compare to, and my motivation for this purchase was not to be green, although it's nice to know I'm being green when using it. I bought this because the Tiffgreen sod supplier recommended cutting with a reel mower between 1/4" and 1-1/4" high.  Tiffgreen is a Bermuda hybrid creeping grass; so given the low cut setting and the fact this mower is specifically designed to cut Bermuda creeping grass and was the only one I could find in this price range, it was a no brainer.		I unpackaged, assembled the mower and grass catcher (sold separately), adjusted the cut height, and cut my 1300 sq ft lawn in less than 1 hour. So yeah, it's easy to assemble, adjust, and use.		In my opinion this mower and the grass catcher is exactly what I expected, given the price. The quality of the mower assembly itself seems very good, but I can see why others have complained about the handle being cheap (it could defiantly be better), but with care it should last several seasons (maybe longer), and seems like it would be simple enough to replace if and when required.	It's not exactly easy to push (it's a little like work), but it's not exactly hard either. It seems easy enough to maneuver, but will take a little time to get use to it and develop a system that is best for cutting my lawn. After a few cuts I'm sure I will be very efficient with it.		I did have to go over some areas twice, but I had to do that with my power rotary mower also. My lawn is completely bordered by brick and cement and it leaves about 4" of uncut grass against all of the borders; so investing in a good trimmer is a must. And as other reviewers have stated, it will get hung up on debris in your yard, but it's not a big deal for me as I keep my grass short and clean.		I knew exactly what I was buying, so I was prepared to deal with all of the things I have discussed; again I was looking for a clean short cut and this does that, so for the price I'm happy.  If I had to replace it, I might decide to invest in a more expensive mower, but this one does exactly what I need for now.		I can see that this type of mower is not for everyone, if your lawn is overgrown, or has a lot of debris; then you don't want this type of mower. This is really for someone that is trying to keep their lawn looking like a golf course, so if that's you, look no further.
0,This was a replacement cover for the grill. The last one lasted 6 years. This new one is made of  a lighter material and repels water ver well. It was also half the price of the original. I am pleased with so far.
0,It was OK but I am still waiting for someone to design a better one.
0,Lovely
0,Great Barrel, good price.  Clean, fast service and perfectly suited for its intended use of storing water. I've seen these offered at a much higher price elsewhere.
0,Neat to have!
0,Works as advertised.  Decent amount of air flow for normal duty cleaning of leaves, grass, etc.  Dial is a great way to fine tune exactly how much air flow you want.
0,Easy to install, works beautifully!
0,I place these in baggies on chairs and sofas and shelves to keep my puppies out of areas I don't want them. Can't hurt them, but scares them to not approching protected areas. Harmless
0,great product for the garden.  it was great to have this delivered so quickly at at a great price thanks
0,Cheap, and fits perfectly.  Made steering like new again.  Advice:  Grease it up really good, keep it greased, it will last a lot longer.	Its designed to be softer than the steering shaft so that it wears down, and your shaft wont.  A brass ring is cheaper and easier to replace than an entire steering shaft.	ALSO:  Once it does wear, its on one side.  Flip it around and you get double the use out of it before you have to put a new one in there.
0,Really like my Weber grill.  I've had the larger grills in the past, but this works for me, whether your cooking for one or six people.  Good quality, good wear and tear.  I clean it completely yearly and just do an up keep the rest of the time. I will always buy a Weber Q. Recommend this item.
0,i have had this for years and never hung it up so i can't review it but it looks nice and solid
0,The price was amazing for the amount of filters. They worked great for our filter.
0,Yes. Good bait Station.
0,Excellent product in many ways, BUT -- BEWARE that it reduces the water pressure. I set up sprinklers carefully to cover a certain area. Then I hooked up two of these timers, and was disappointed to see that the area covered by the sprinklers was substantially less than it had been. In other words, they reduced the water pressure going through them by a non-trival amount. As far as I can tell, it is otherwise an excellent product, but disappointing in this undiscussed and undisclosed  respect.
0,Very helpful tool
0,Exactly as advertised.
0,Since Ive addes this superior thrive my plants have begun to show new growth. My grandpa was exasterbated when he saw I had this. Where tf did you get this from? Thats some good stuff
0,Bought this for my Mom so she can sit out on the porch and "glide".  It fit the porch perfectly and was relatively simple to assemble.  My one tick off on a perfect score is that I wish the ties for the cushions were a couple inches longer.  Given their length it is difficult to get a proper tie that can be easily removed when you want/need to take the cushions off.
0,Good for my cloches, but expensive for the amount of material you get.
0,Quickly repaired/replaced my Huskee 46" mowing deck spindle.
0,for the price and how many you get i was really happy with this buy. They seem to be two sided.meaning one side is smooth,and the other has a mild texture to it for different types of pens i think.either way,excellent size,fantastic deal and had it in two days or so. Check it out,Im sure you'll be very very happy with them. I know I am.
0,We have a 3/4 acre lot with 23 flower beds, a veggie garden and numerous fruit and ornamental trees to edge and trim. I bought this to get rid of the power cable hassle of getting around everything, switching outlets etc. It was the same reason we bought a 20v B&D hedge trimmer. It has worked out very well. About 80% of the trimming and edging was done on a single charge at low setting. The other 20% was finished with a battery from the hedge trimmer. We now keep up with the task instead of putting it off because of the hassle. We also have a B&D 20v drill. With all 4  of the batteries being inter changeable, we can trim our 30 hemlocks in one day instead of dragging it out. I hope it lasts as long as the hedge trimmer.
0,Even cooking, easily seasoned. Assembly a breeze.  I read the last statements  My grill was fully assembled as the legs are now fold out. Installation requires, one brace in the legs, one handle (4 screws) and two side wings. Thats its. Start cooking (after seasoning of course)
0,A+++
0,Came with wrong size cotter pins; had to buy my own.  That said, I do really like this mower.  It was easy to assemble, easy to push, and the blades are sharp.  Easily cuts my St. Augustine. However, I do wish the low-cutting height was lower.
0,Bench arrived this evening and I had it assembled in 15 mins.  It really looks nice, and is solidly constructed.  Only the legs needed to be attached, and all the hardware was included - even a tiny wrench, and an extra set of washers/bolt.  I feel like I got a real bargain!
0,Love it. You can turn the nozzel and secure in any direction when tightening the cap. Handle is well balanced. Shipped fast.
0,exactly what I expected . good product
0,Great Microtip shears and the nonstick coating makes trimming resin/sap producing plants/shrubs/trees a breeze. Blade clean up easily after use and stay sharp. I have regular micro-tip fiskars that are awesome as well but I use the regular sheers on "drier" plants.
0,Works well around the house.
0,Works pretty well.  I use it both for the mildew and discoloration the vinyl eaves and soffits of my home as well as moss that tends to gross on the blocks of a garden retaining wall.  Noticeable affect on the moss in just a couple of days.  On the eaves/soffits, I have found it works best if you clean them well first and them periodically spay them with a fresh coat of the Wet & Forget to keep them clean.
0,great tool
0,I have purchased several different water garden /bird bath fountains. This is the best one to date.
0,Good price and holds my Costco 9' market umbrella perfectly.
0,They look exactly how they looked on the Picture. They are very cute, tiny but cute. Just got them yesterday , but i am super excited to watch them grow in the future.
0,The diaphragms I ordered were shipped promptly and arrived the same.  They fit the valves and took care of the leak problem that I was having. Thanks much!
0,Works well, you just stick it inside a big enough planter and then you can hang the hummingbird feeder on the hook.
0,very happy with this, it keeps the majority of the fish food in the ring so not much is wasted and I like having a central area for the fish to eat.  It is heavy enought that if the fish hit it, the food stays put
0,Attracted a lot of cool looking finches in just a couple of days.  Does not come with feed sock.
0,Really beautiful
0,My grandkids love this. The two year old thinks she's flying so when she says "Fly nana fly" I know she wants to swing in this. It's big enough for the 11 year old to curl up in and read. Love it.
0,These things are great for starting a charcoal grill the proper way without lighter fluid which taints the taste of the meat. Just pile into a pyramid, poke one of these down in there and light it up! I'd never do it any other way now.
0,No longer available but good while it lasted
0,In my country setting I needed a 75 foot hose, and with that length, lighter weight is a nice feature. This hose is built and performs as advertised: nickel plated connectors, heavy duty kink protectors on the ends, very flexible - and very light weight.	Does its job well. And being lead free is a nice added benefit. Highly recommended.
0,finally.......
0,Amazing value.  All components are well made.  Excellent burner assembly.  I had ZIPPO problems putting it together.  I tossed the screw driver they give you.  Went straight to my cordless drill with a Phillips head bit.  It is beautiful when on.  I would say for certain it is more of the ambiance than for heat.  If you want heat I would go with the standard tower with a large burner at the top.  But that is not to say this does not put out heat, it does and is sufficient to warm the grand kids when they hop out of the pool.  Buy it, you will love it.  Not sure why others had a problem putting it together, I guess they never put a model car or airplane together as a kid.  It is child's play compared to putting together a piece of know down furniture.  Like a desk that comes in a box that weighs a million pounds and has "cam" and "widgets galore"
0,This is great electric smoker, I used it all the time for family gathering.
0,This baby cuts like a chain saw
0,I bought this birdfeeder two summers ago and couldn't be happier. It has held up perfectly and still looks like new. I fill with thistle seed and attract too many finches to count. The birds love it, feel safe on it, and it isn't unusual to have 4-6 birds feeding on it at the same time.
0,Put this around my Daylillies at my cottage, did not have enough.  Deer ate the buds around the unprotected plants, left the protected ones alone.
0,I have many of the Perky Pet 30-ounce feeders, but this is my most recent purchase and they improved the design.  It is easier to clean and has differences in the ports, and it was the favorite feeder of the hummingbirds this summer (out of 8 feeders!).  Thanks for the product design improvement!
0,Great sturdy flag holder that holds Old Glory securely.
0,I like this test kit and the accuracy of the readings.  My only complaint is that there is not an app to accompany the product to give you directions what chemicals should be added next to your pool.  I would consider spending a little more and finding a kit that provides clearer instructions and provides better directions on how to respond to your readings.

0,Very nice light and i got a pretty good harvest.
0,I have a rock garden and I needed a sprinkler that I can hook up to my watering system. When I saw this product offered in gardening catalogs I decided to try this unique sprinkler.		The sprinkler is quite flexible. You can water fairly large areas by spreading out the noodles and then adjusting the water output to the desired flow. The same is true when watering smaller and odd shaped areas.		The Noodlehead comes with a lawn spike so you can stick it in the ground and prevent it from tip over. The whole system is very light. I used two of these in my rock garden.
0,Bought this for washing my car at home instead of paying the 10 dollars every week or two weeks to get my car washed. This nozzle works great for the purposes I got it for, as it has many different settings from your low presured shower for watering flowers to high pressure stream thats strong enough to get some brake dust off. The thumb control isn't hard to move at all so controlling the water flow is very simple. I think it would be easy for senior citizens to use as well. I also like the fact that it's not metal, so less chance to rust. The Ray Padula doesn't feel light and cheap, but it's not like carrying around a weight either. I'm completely satisfied with the product I received for the price I payed.
0,So far these are taking off.  No flowers, but they are very fast growing.  Big leaves... now I just need the flowers to come.
0,Great birdhouse -- will wait for the first occupants for final review.
0,I live in an area where ice storms are frequent even if power outages are not.  It is disconcerting to realize how much our lives are dependent on electricity.  To make sure I have at least minimal power in the event of a major ice event I purchased this generator.  It was delivered in 10 days by a freight company and the packaging was still secure and showed no handling damage.  Inside the box was a sturdy well built machine that only took a few minutes to finish assembling.  There is a pictograph sheet in the packaging that makes assembly a snap.  Be sure to look at both sides of the sheet.  Some assembly pictures are not clear enough on side 1.  The generator is shipped without oil in the engine.  The exact amount of oil and a funnel are included in the package.  The engine starts easily if the directions are followed to the letter.  That includes turning on the on switch on the panel.  I'm not sure why the generator needs an off/on switch when shutting off the fuel supply is a standard way of shutting down an engine.		The spec sheet says the generator will run 9 hours @ 50% load on one 20# (5 gallon) cylinder.  That is not near long enough in my book and I don't plan on switching bottles.  I have propane heat although it is electrically driven so that means I have a large propane supply tank out back.  I built a manifold on the high pressure side of the tank outlet to tap the full pressure of the tank.  Then I ran 80' of 3/8" hose (the same hose as to a BBQ) to reach the point where I plan to position the generator.  I was concerned that the long hose might diminish the flow of propane to the point of starving the engine for fuel.  I needn't have worried.  With the generator running and loaded the pressure drop along the hose was about 5 psi.  I now have a propane supply that should fuel the generator for several days if needed.  Since propane leaves little residue in the engine I doubt that I will concern myself with periodically running the engine.		This generator is not large enough to provide power to my air conditioning unit.  We live hundreds of miles inland and hurricanes are not a major problem.  If summertime outages occur here they are usually of short duration and we can move to a motel that has power if necessary.  My concern was winter time outages and powering heat and refrigeration.  I made a window access for the extension cords from a short piece of 1 X 2.  I can roll out some extension cords to the heater and refrigerator, phone chargers and what not..  Lights will be candles and LED lamps.  My preliminary test indicates that I will have ample power for that.		Pull start engines can be difficult in cold weather so I have cleared space in my heated garage to store the generator.  If needed it can be rolled out and started up in just a few minutes.		I hope I never need it but I am ready if I do.
0,Excellent quality, not stuck together at all!
0,Works great! We use them when cooking over the open fire using cast iron and its amazing we can grab lots of hot stuff.  You can forge the ring in the fires or mordor with these.
0,Provided you're not grilling for a crowd, this has everything you will ever need.  Why, for small grilling sessions,  buy these $300+ propane grills with all the associated maintenance, danger and complexity?  It defies reason.		This small grill makes cooking virtually impossible to screw up provided you keep an eye on it.  My suggestion:  use briquettes ignited with a combination of mesquite or hickory chips and newspaper.  You will have long enough to grill the equivalent of any propane grill.  It will just take a little longer......
0,Great price,sturdy,thick......would buy it again!
0,These are great and versatile clippers.  They have a saw blade on one side of the shears, and are very sharp. They are light and easy to hold.  They come with a holster you can clip to your belt. I got them for my man for his birthday, and he loves them. Uses them all the time. He's a grower, builder and jack of all trades who appreciates a good tool. I am also a gardener, and have never been disappointed by Fiskars.
0,I needed new bars.... these are new bars.... don't be cheap, get stainless.... my grill was so happy when it got new bars...
0,I use this product in my garden while my Mom who has her own garden does not.  While not every plant is better then hers you can see clear difference between the two gardens.  My garden overall looks a lot healthier and larger.
0,small but health plants .... looking forward to them blooming....used a special potting soil for cactus and a special fertizler for cactus also, they are green and happy.
0,This is a good quality bug and leaf skimmer that looks great and gets the job done. I didn't realize people were so particular about a skimming but after reading the reviews, I see that they are. We use ours a couple times per week and we store it outside even when it rains. We still can see no signs of use and the net stays very taught which is helpful when you're skimming.
0,GOOD
0,They fit perfectly and arrived on time.
0,great
0,It fits perfectly in a new Weber Genesis S-330 grill. I tried it once for a rotisserie  chicken but didn't take the time to soak the chips first. My mistake. They flamed up bad and I had to dose it with water.  But the Bbq  was so well built that there was no damage and the chicken was great. The smoker also held up great but I need a lesson in using it. Be sure to soak your chips.  Lol. I can't wait to try it again .
0,Really small just trying to get it they winter
0,This was a great price and most of all got free shipping with the order I placed, Only Complaint I have is it should of been packed better in the shipping box, the bottle was in it's own plastic bag but one of the bottles leaked,, including out of the bag onto my other items.
0,Best price on the internet with Prime
0,I bought 2 of these.  One for me and one for my mom.  She is 86 years old and still likes to do yard work but bending over is difficult.  It is good for grass and the grass that grows stickers on it so you don't have to touch it.  Its rotating head makes it easier to get to hard areas.  I would have given it a 5 but the rotating head is plastic and not sure how well it will hold up.		One of them came in damaged.  The blades were bent and I had to return.  Amazon promptly issued an RMA and entered the replacement.  Well done.
0,I have only used this hose for a month.  It seems to very durable and releases water in large drops.  It is flexible enough to be stored easily.
0,Awesome product!!! I had a lot of success with these.. I started mine inside thus year. Within a week I had sprouts.. Grew them to 2 inches inside and planted them inntje ground.. Definitely will buy them again if I need them
0,Have to be on top of using it for it to work, don't plan on just pouring it in one time and see a huge change, There is a method to it, like previous users have stated. Use it carefully, to not stress the fish out.
0,Great price.
0,Great product, arrived on time.  I purchased this so I had two strainers for my pool.  It makes it easier to clean.  I change out the one in the pool with my spare.  I let my spare dry for a day and it make cleaning the strainer a lot easier.  This way I do not have to run my pump without a strainer in the skimmer.
0,These do a great job a retarding etiolation. Other plants growing in the greenhouse and using white LED are twice as tall, skinny stems and no axial growth. The ones under these lights are much more robust with axial stems being produced. I don't review all products I purchase, but these are above standard. I hope they last a long time.
0,Birds love them.  It sticks to my teeth when I try it!
0,seems to work
0,If it holds up the season it is so much better than twist ties.  How many times did I say I wish I had invented velco.
0,Great cordless trimmer.  It gives the power to trim without dragging a cord.  Great value.
0,if they have any thing I need for my green & tunnel house i will buy from them  You can't go wrong
0,So much easier than processing myself from the beach.  Works on my garden just the same as my own.  Great product.
0,Endorsed by mice as a humane feeding device! They go in, eat the bait, and leave at their leisure. There's conflicting info about whether this trap is even intended for mice. The Amazon one-line description lists mice first, but the chart showing which animals are best targeted with which trap doesn't include mice for this one, and the box the trap comes in doesn't either. The chart and the box are right.		It appears that despite a hair trigger, mice just aren't heavy enough to spring the trap. I see several other reviews that say chipmunks and other animals of similar size also sometimes walk in and out of the trap without springing it, though several reviews do report success with chipmunks and rats.		The Havahart video on the Amazon product page suggests for smaller animals hanging the bait over the trigger plate, so they have to stand up on it to get the bait. That may work well for chipmunks and the like, but it still doesn't work for mice, at least the ones at my house.		I've also seen complaints that some squirrels can push their way out of the trap after it's closed. There's no latch to keep the door closed, only the pressure from a spring. I haven't had that problem myself.		On the positive side, the trap is solidly made, easy to set, easy to open for release, and works well for animals of the right size. And it doesn't seem to hurt them.		Tip: if the trap doesn't set when you pull the handle back, try pulling the cage door up a little higher at the end by hand. Works for me.
0,Goof, we really are getting a kick out of it.
0,I usually use scientific tubing, the generic clear stuff, because I never knew anything different until I wanted something stiffer. The generic clear tubing is awesome for low pressures and drip watering a lot of plants because the emitters can be placed without the tubing trying to retain its shape too much and moving it after placement. This is where the Rain Bird tubing fails at, its stiff and hard, its not easily placed at the base of plants. However I favor this tubing because of its rigid factor. The Rain Bird tubing is far superior with spray emitters and higher pressures. With higher pressures, emitters will come flying off of the scientific tubing if they aren't super glued on there. The Rain Bird tubing holds them in place but this is also an issue because it holds them too well and I have to cut the emitters off for cleaning or changing types! However, this tubing is durable, rigid, etc, it stays upright when I mount it on cane poll while scientific/chemical tubing droops over.		RainBird Pros*	*Rigid and retains shape	*Retains emitters	*250Ft for a fair price!		Cons*	*Emitters have to be cut off! :(	*Very stiff!		Scientific Tubing pros*	*May or may not be cheaper depending on where you shop.	*Very pliable.	*removable emitters		Cons*	*Emitters blow off from high pressures!	*Droops over when mounted vertically.		Picture included for details.
0,Needed to replace the covers, and this fit perfectly.
0,Very happy with this flag. Purchased for our Neighborhood Flagpole. At this time holding up well to heavy rains and wind. Would recommend.
0,I previously thought these were only really good for rotisserie chicken - and after using this to make chicken I can confirm, yes, this is probably the best way to cook a whole chicken. Cooked evenly, juicy; perfect. BUT what I learned after some experimentation is that this thing is good for most of the stuff you'd grill. Lately I make rodizio style picanha which is like witchcraft when not left on the heat too long - and in terms of presentation, what a show stopper, slicing the beef right off the spit. I will get a rotisserie for my gas grill based on my results with this great investment for my kettle grill.
0,I have quite a few of these and they have yet to fail. Have no problem giving them a recommendation and will purchase again in the future.
0,This worked perfectly! We had some kind of slugs and I wasn't sure if it was Japanese beetles and/or others. So, I started with this. The brown patches have almost completely gone away in weeks, so I guess Japanese beetles it was!
0,Seems for the birds here in southern MA this blend is a great one, well liked by so many wild birds in our backyard.
0,Worked very effectively.

0,I received my order in a timely manner and it was just what I wanted.  I have used this plant food before and I really like it. I felt I got it at a good price and was very happy with the service.
0,This is a very handy tool.  There is no gas to mix and no extension cord to drag along.  I can do all of the trimming on my property on one charge.  It is also very lightweight and easy to handle.
0,Can't beat this....I got 2 and each one has a slightly different finish so they don't look like stamped out cheap junk like so much on the market these days.  They are going to look so cute mounted by my little goldfish pond.
0,This is a great and powerful yard tool.
0,Last years results says it all for us. This does the job nicely and our flowering beauties made it through the season with little disturbance. It is a bit pricey, that is why we rated a four.
0,Worked as advertised. Grass is thin, but grew in bunches quickly after 5 days combined with Scotts Starter turf builder.
0,Love it
0,Perfect size and price for a beginner gardener.  Has shelves and room for a small table.  We used stronger stakes be asks we get some strong wind here and it's still standing after several of those and a couple of hail storms.  I love it and recommend it.
0,Using it for my peony bush and it works well. Sturdy and well made. This is the first year my peony bush did not get hammered after a bad rain. Plant looks great no hanging over.
0,Very comfortable
0,CLEAN UP, ISLE 4 OR SHALL I SAY "CLEANUP"... MY YARD. OWN A HALF ACRE, AN 1/8 IS HEAVILY WOODED AND A NURSERY FOR MOSQUITOES AND JUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT BITES OR SUCKS BLOOD. I TEND TO OVER DO SOME PROJECTS AND IS THE REASON I BOUGHT "2" STINGERS, RIGHT-AWAY. ONE FOR BACKUP.  ONE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH, BUT WITH BOTH STINGERS GOING ABOUT 10 HOURS A NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT, CONTROL ONLY TOOK A MONTH, WITH LESS AND LESS EACH WEEK. STILL HAVE A MONTH AND AHALF TO PRIME "SQUITO" WEATHER BUT NO WORRIES, THE STINGERS INFLICTED ENOUGH DAMAGE	TO SAVE THE SUMMER AND ENJOY THE FALL.	A+ ALL AROUND
0,great
0,This is the highest quality shovel I have ever purchased or used and the price is similar to the shovels in the big box stores, but seems to be built quite a bit stronger.  And they are American made.  I think these are the best bang-for-the-buck available and purchased another Bully Tools shovel of a different type.  I believe I will standardize on Bully Tools products for any other outdoor tool of this type they sell.
0,Totally happy! No more squirrels or birds eating my garden. Did not expect it to actually work for the squirrels but it does. Can be a little hard to work with. It tends to catch on anything but honestly that is not even as bad as expected. Hardest thing was figuring out how to put it on and have it easy to access inside when I need to weed or harvest. Took 3 tries but finally got it. So far no damage and we have had some storms. Hope to get more than one season out of it but if I don't I won't complain. Can barely see it in the photo.
0,So I got this skimmer to replace the older one that we had from intex. One thing that immediately stood out was its size which was way bigger than the original smaller one. Not sure if bigger is better but the top fins/vanes seem to create a funnel action which is most likely to increase throughput and get particles stuck in the filter? Someone with an engineering degree in waster distributions systems might be able to chime in.		Skimmer works great and clears the top of the pool in 30 mins when the 2100GPH pump is turned on which is great.		Slight design flaw which the old one had as well is that the metal frame mounting could benefit from a rubber pad so the filter doesn't "ride up" and changes its angle on the pool. It needs to be level to perfectly function with the water.		If someone needs a quickset mounting brackets send me a message.
0,It's worth buying... they are well made. Tie & Glow.

0,Bought 2 of these and very impressed, well built and getting 30 amp peaks to the battery's with a MPPT charge controller, Panels are connected in series. I'm using a 12v setup.
0,Comfortable and very helpful when gardening
0,This step has been nothing but sturdy for me and I'm a heavier gentleman. It's not high, so if you have a deep well style hot tub, you will still need to get in like you're mounting a horse, but it's definitely stable and works well.
0,My griller family and I love this rack.  We got it with our new kettle grill, because we wanted to teach our daughter how to grill.  So it is really hers.  But don't tell hubby that.  He uses it about two times a month, and he has gone out and bought another one to use on his new gas grill.  now he can really do enough ribs for the family get together.
0,Best hummingbird feeder on the market. Easy to clean because of the wide opening at the base and the base opens into two parts. Lasts for 4 -5 years in direct sunlight.
0,Works good, seeds are doing well. Will buy again
0,Maybe a bit wider than it needs to be, but this is a fine brush indeed.  Nice brass bristles, wide steel scraper, very comfortable handle.  I've learned to trust Libman brushes, and this is no exception.
1,The item sounds good in theory, but it fails to deliver. I purchased it to water a number of raised garden beds. No matter how I try, the nozzles cannot be aimed as expected. I now hand hold it to water my garden beds.
1,My heat mat did not heat evenly and it showed in the sprouting of my seeds.  It was like there were 2 rows about 3 inches wide that would not sprout.  When I took my tray off the mat, they sprouted.  When I grew another tray alongside the one on the mat, I had no problems sprouting any of those seeds, which were from the same stock.  I already threw the box away, so I can't return it.		I do like the grow light system from the same company, though.
1,Very poor quality - I expected better than this, based on all the positive reviews.		This is not much thicker than a plastic carrier bag from the local supermarket		Poor quality and I would NOT recommend this to anyone		The only place this will be going is in a drawer out the way
1,I would give these less than 1 star if I could the foam doesn't grown anything it must be soil. Wish I could get my money back for these were a waste of money.
1,Did not maintain air had to send back for refund.
1,We ordered this product which was allegedly shipped as "new" but when we opened up the tightly sealed container, a bunch of bugs and moths flew out.  We live on a small island with a fragile Eco-system and this is absolutely unethical, and potentially disastrous!
1,Order a size smaller, these are much larger than measured
1,I tested this pump at around 150 GPH on a flat plain. But when it had to pump water straight up a 3.5 foot long tube inside my fountain, the water flow dropped to about one-tenth of that. I was only getting 1/4 of the flow that I was getting from my old 60 GPH pump.
1,The product did not work at all.  The transmitter between the display and collector did not work.  I have owned three of these and the same thing happened.  would never buy this product again.
1,So I just received my pair today hoping this would be better quality than my other tools. My other pruners include Fiskars, Avon, and various other cheapies. I figured this time I'd buy something a little bit higher in quality, but still didn't want to break the bank. Can't say I'm impressed however.		I opened up the box, and yeah, nothing special, which is exactly what I was wanting. Just a standard workhorse set of pruners. I take them outside, and with the first few snips the spring mechanism was already not working properly (I had to "assist" it to get it to spring back). So I snip a few more branches, all around 1/4" or so in diameter. Now the spring mechanism is busted completely, and the locking mechanism is no longer working properly either.		So, I guess I just got a bad pair, but for it to break that quickly doesn't exactly send loads of confidence on the brand. I sent a message to Corona to see how they respond, and that'll be the deciding factor on whether I'll give them another chance or not.		And yes, bought through Amazon directly, and they have the Corona engraving on the tool so unlikely it's a Chinese knock-off.		***Update 4/19***		So I haven't heard a response back from the company, so I've just decided to return it. I bought some cheap/small Fiskars instead, which the lock mechanism already detached for a minute, but was an easy fix and otherwise functions perfectly. So I guess I'll stick with them instead; I'm sure I just receieved a bad product, but I also never got a response from the company so I'd rather not deal with it. If you are going to buy the Corona Pruner, I'd recommend trying the 3/4" instead of the 5/8", the way the 5/8" is designed seems to be more prone to errors.
1,Zipper was installed upside down so it zips open from the bottom, super annoying.
1,Never grew
1,Bought this pump b/c the price was lower than the local parts dealer.	Big mistake.  It didn't last three months.	Seemed like it was good quality, looked and felt sturdy like the old one (which lasted 10 years).
1,Seeds not growing. followed instructions to get them to germinate. Soaked in warm water 24hrs, put in fridge with moist soil for 60-120 days, planted. 3 weeks in, no signs of life, dug one out, nothing growing.		Over all i cannot recommend, they did not grow for me.
1,This flag shown here is not the flag they sent, so be careful. They sent a Jolly Roger with eye patch labeled Dead man's Chest. No point to send it back as it was only 5 bucks, but it is not the flag in the picture!
1,I bought one of these last year at the local Walmart along with the edger attachment.  I had previously owned nothing but low-end Weedeater trimmers and I had good experiences with them.  Weedeater is a Poulan brand.  Both previous Weedeaters performed well for several years and had to be junked simply because I could not find parts anymore.  So I decided to go for the upper-scale Poulan Pro with interchangeable attachments.  I got the first one home and immediately had to return it--it would not run.  Walmart replaced it without question.  When I started using it, I liked the power but found it heavy and tiring to use for long periods, however, it performed fine for my purposes.  lt worked for a little over a year.  This morning I went to start it and the cranking rope did not rewind.  This is usually fairly simple to fix.  I took off the motor cover and discovered the mount next to the cranking mechanism had broken off of the motor casting.  There is no way to repair this without replacing the motor.  So much for the "pro" in Poulan Pro.  I took it to the curb with the rest of the trash.		Avoid Poulan Pro.  In my opinion they rank with Ryobi as some of the worst outdoor products available.  Just buy a low-end Weedeater.  I just got back from Home Depot where I bought an Echo trimmer with edger attachment.  Five year warranty for residential use.  I have an Echo blower that has performed perfectly for 6-8 years with minimal care.  I only hope their trimmer/edgers are as reliable.  I was disappointed that the Echo does not use the Universal attachments that are common to several other brands.  But the bottom line on this is that you should buy good quality first, otherwise you will have to spend more in the long run.
1,Failure rate is extremely high on these sure pop series sprinklers. I have over 20 of these installed in my yard and half of them have failed within 4 years. Since broken sprinklers are not necessarily noticed immediately, any failure can lead to huge wasted water costs. I've since replaced all of them with the 1800 series or unibody series sprinklers.
1,One bottle only covers 400 sq feet of garden.
1,What is it with these things?! I used it once. Next time I smoked ribs it came up with the LLL fault. I can't get it to work in either port. For $15 these should last longer than one use. It's been longer than 30 days so I can't even return it. Terrible.
1,I owned a Weber Genesis grill for 10 years before replacing it with this one.  My old grill featured stainless grates, stainless burners and stainless flavorizer bars.  I gave the grill away and it is still going strong.  I cleaned it several times each year and I was always able to make each part shine.  Not one bit of rust.		After 1 year of owning the Weber Genesis S-310 I have come to find that the stainless steel parts are not really stainless.  I keep the grill covered when not in use and it is kept on my covered balcony throughout the year.  I cleaned the parts yesterday and came to find that the flavorizer bars were severely rusted as well as the drip pan.		Many of my friends have warned me that Weber started using cheap quality stainless steel that will rust.  I am not sure how they can call something stainless if it rusts after one year.		I called Weber customer service today and they said my parts cannot be replaced under warranty until they are crumbling in my hand.		I bought a stainless steel grill to avoid replacing parts.  It looks like Weber has decided to put profits ahead of quality.  What a shame.  I always thought they made a great product but this will be the last time I buy a Weber.
1,holes too small for sunflower seeds, to big for millet etc.
1,These roses never grew let alone sprouted. I was sad too. I'll just buy rose plants from now on instead of wasting my money doing it this way. I did everything I was supposed to.
1,Wasn't that impressed. It killed a couple of my plants and it didn't help at all with the mosquitoes. I sprayed it in the Grass around our fire pit so we could sit out around a camp fire hoping that it would keep them away, but it didn't. Sorry but I have to give it a 1 star.
1,Battery died on this one, after only one month.
1,That piece of crap - "proudly made in China" - has nothing to do with soviet army and "special forces"! One can find authentic Soviet era showel on internet, even collectible old style with rivets, but in working condition - i bought one for $30 with S&H. Steel is very different. And, of course, nobody never use it as a throwing axe! Former soviet soldier.	P.S. Buy showel in Home Depot and cut a handle - at least u can feel what u are buying.
1,I got this to reduce the number of flies on the patio when we eat dinner outside.		Bottom line, it does not work...flies were flying around all over, and not one went in the trap.		I put it near the garbage cans for 2 days, and I caught 1 fly.
1,No flowers ever grew!
1,I honestly loved it for the first month I owned it, I was impressed with its quality for the price. The canvas has a weave in it to strengthen it, the assembly was easy. I read reviews prior to purchasing it and seen most people complain about it blowing away and anyone with half a brain could see that with what they provide you isn't enough to hold its ground from a breeze. Well yesterday we had a windy day around 50 mph winds and the green house didn't even make it till noon. every single bend in the pipe actually got snapped by the weight of the wind tearing the green house to shreds, it also snapped a couple bolt used to hold the center trusses together. I wanted to love this product and I did love this product but you get what you pay for I suppose.
1,sucks don't waste your time
1,I bought this to use on my Blackstone Griddle to scrape the iron surface with, from the pictures it looks like it would work great.  In reality its a cheaply made piece of crap that you'll wish you'd never bought.  Utterly useless.
1,This item was more of a weed chopper than removal tool. all it seemed to do was go in the ground and chop the root and weed to pieces. would not recommend
1,I've read other reviews about these feeders, but I have not been so fortunate.  I filled two of them with sunflower seeds two weeks ago, and the birds can't get the seeds through the mesh, so the feeders are still over 90 percent full.  Don't waste your money.
1,Bought this pad to protect my knees when I climb onto the tailgate on my truck knees down.  I have had a number of pads that are soft and firm enough to protect the knees.  This pad looks nice, but is much to hard, or dense to feel good on the knees.  I am hoping that it breaks in and gets softer.  I should probably return it.  Received it quickly and it was well packed.  Disappointed for sure--wouldn't recommend.
1,not very functional
1,It is Ok when you look at picture you think it is a year round shelter but it not
1,Fantastic idea.  However this product is not well made.  The two sticks that form the tent shape are prone to bending out of shape.  Once that happens, you cannot get the proper shape again.  Also, when I received my unit and took it out of the very large cardboard shipping container, the tent had not been assembled properly and the two sticks which gives it its shape came totally out of the netting.  I tried reforming the sticks and putting them back into the netting material but I was unable to do that successfully and the product does not sit on the ground squarely -- leaving big gaps around two sides.  Birds and squirrels get underneath the gap.  I would have returned this item, but it requires such a large shipping container and work to repack it, I decided to "eat" the purchase price and not return the item.  I don't think I will waste my money on another.
1,Private did not pick up any dirt from the floor of my pool
1,I should have taken a picture of all the mosquito  bites I got after spayed this product all over my jacket, pants and hat. Fair enough I was in Canada, in deep woods and it was at dusk, a lot of mosquitoes and they were hungry, I wasn't expect to get no bite but getting so many bites on my arms, legs and face, that just proves this product does NOT work.
1,Bought 2, and only one is still in infrequent service.  The first one developed leaks around the end couplings fairly quickly.  We haven't use the other one very much yet, but I don't have high hopes on how well it will last.  Too bad, since this is a good idea for a hose.
1,I have to give this 2 stars because I had to send it back because it was defective. Amazon is always so accommodating when taking something back if done in the allotted time. Even when put in an inch of water the meter didn't even register the wet. I think the meter looks cool but getting one with one probe is just as good. I'm waiting on my replacement and will let you know how I like that one.
1,The hose itself is cheap and the connectors were even cheaper. It leaked terribly from both ends and was unusable. I replaced the connectors to make it work, but I should have returned it.
1,Should be called AcuWrong. Temp is 10 - 15 over the real temp in sun. I even updated to the dual solar panel for the 5 in 1.
1,Fist of all, they could add about 4 more foot on the AC cord, Never see anyone only have a 1 1/2 cord. Looks very cheaply made. Only 2 little screws to hold all the weight of this unit. The hanging ring is not solid, Had to weld the ring together so it won't let go in a strong wind. Could of use a On/Off switch on it too.
1,2nd time I've tried these.	They don't work. Worse - one of them fell apart IMMEDIATELY, and the 2nd one is also coming apart.	I should have known better, but I wanted something to keep the yearly infestation of gnats down.		Don't waste your money.  The better alternative (although unsightly and disgusting) is putting up a couple fly strips for a few weeks (and water your plants a little less to avoid moist soil and standing water).
1,September 2015:	So far it has worked well. The deer love some bushes we planted and kept eating the tops off of them. Not anymore. Being solar powered eliminates all power cables yet provides protection.		Update March 2016:	DOA -was working fine then just stopped. Light barely flashes and no spark at all (yes, I got brave and grabbed both terminals with my hands).		Glad it has a 1 year warranty but the extra shipping expense and wasted time are hardly worth it. I may or may not return it.
1,Water only dribbles out of the frog's mouth, even midday in sunny CA.  The water puddles on the bowl surround and runs off the outside of the bowl.  We are very disappointed.  The company has promised to send a new solar pump to see if that is the problem.  If that does not work, we will return the product.  The bowl and frog are attractive, but without the functioning pump it is not worth keeping.
1,shipping was lightning fast.  however, these hangers are the same generic ones you get everywhere.  sunlight supply is the listed manufacturer, though the packaging lacks any info on manufacturer or country of origin.  doesn't even have a upc.  i contacted sunlight supply and they confirmed these are NOT manufactured by them.  the seller told me it was the old ones by sunlight, pre sun grip.  that is false.  if you look around, you'll find the exact same ones often branded by the selling store, like spartan "brand" canned food.  i returned them on principle alone, for the product is misrepresented and the seller refused to acknowledge it
1,Really can't tell what it is in real life. Smallish.
1,Did not germinate or grow.
1,Does not work great, I have the set and leave it on day and night, only caught 3 or 4 little flies. this does not catch as many as i seen other brands on youtube.
1,BAD SEED FAILED TO SPROUT.
1,Only fits some units, not very strong.
1,Did nothing but get the  bees  mad.  Doesn't foam doesn't stop them and sure doesn't kill them.
1,This is a nice product but it's available at Walmart for less than half.
1,never grew
1,Pieces of crap. They bend and warp in the sun and the permanent marker bleaches right off. Completely useless. I thought I was being smart and saving money, but not if sharpie writing completely fades! I bought the stronger ones&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/KINGLAKE-50-Pcs-2-36-34-x3-94-34-White-Thick-Plastic-Waterproof-Plant-T-type-Tags-Markers-Nursery-Garden-Labels-Re-Usable-Plant-Tags/dp/B00ZF0IWU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">KINGLAKE 50 Pcs 2.36"x3.94" White Thick Plastic Waterproof Plant T-type Tags Markers Nursery Garden Labels Re-Usable Plant Tags</a>&nbsp;and will not ever go back to these cheap ones.		See the attached pics taken 2 months to the day after planting my tomatoes. The faded one is this product, the other one is the thick plastic product I linked to above.
1,I give this product 4 star for functionality but 1 star for composition/ingredient disclosure.		I've been using a scraper or scrubbing pad to clean my grates but not the wire brush. Although rare, there were cases in Rhode Island between '09 - '10 where six people developed abdominal pain after eating grilled meat. It was later found in the X-Ray results that they accidentally ingested wire bristles from a brush used to clean the grill.		This looks to be a good alternative cleaning tool for the grill. It is abrasive enough to get the cooked on grease on the grates with very little effort. Once the "stone" develops a groove it also cleans the sides of the grates in one pass.		The drawbacks are:		Wears off easily.	Expensive factoring the number of uses you'll get out of it.	Leaves a powdery residue - a major cause of concern for me.		Now for the composition.		This looks a lot like a pumice but it is not. This is a man made product by a company called Earthstone international.	When you look at the packaging nowhere does it say what this is made of. There is only vague references saying "made from recycled materials" or "1 Glass bottle saved from landfill per stone"		The phrase "1 Glass bottle saved from landfill per stone" I thought were just part of carbon credit or offsetting mambo jumbo. BUT no, it is literally "Glass bottle saved from landfill" because it goes IN THE PRODUCT. The process is called Foamed Glass where recycled glass is crushed into a very fine powder and put in the furnace along with other ingredients. The rest of the process you can just look up foam glass or cellular glass process		What happens with the powdery residue that is left behind after scrubbing and adheres to your food? Would you eat it? Would the CEO eat it? HAH!		There is also a video of a news article in their own website about their product. It's fascinating that in the video it was EXPLAINED WHY THEY DID NOT DISCLOSE in the packaging the materials that this grill stone is made of.		Lots of info in the "about" section of their web site including an EPA certification fine print.		Quote:		EPA/DfE relies solely on Earthstone, its integrity and good faith, for information on the composition, ingredients, and attributes of this product. EPA/DfE has not independently identified, i.e., via chemical analysis, the ingredients in the product formula, nor evaluated any of Earthstone's non-ingredient claims		Overall good cleaner but I would not be buying anymore of this. So I'm back to scrubbing pad for now.
1,The test strips themselves work fine.  But the colors printed on the label are hard to interpret.  Maybe if their label was slightly different, it would be easier to read.
1,Be careful, more like saw dust, not chips, fine for certain smokers I guess, not what I thought, tiny containers as well.
1,Will not buy again. None germinated.
1,This is made by Flexgen (Flexogen?), which is the worst hose I've had the misfortune to use.		Don't buy this unless you need to brush up on your curse words.		no stars		This is the most prone-to-kinks hose (I was going to say 'kinkiest hose') I've ever worked with, and I'm 70 years old and seen a lot o' hoses, honey!  Weather 50*, slight breeze, in the shade.  Perfect conditions for strenuous yard work.  I worked an hour trying to get this wound around one of those "roller" things mounted on the wall.  Sweat was pouring down me.  I knew I would never get it straightened out enough to get it on the roller.  I quit trying.  I got this at Lowe's, but I wanted to warn you not to buy it.		I got a Flexilla, and it's far better!  Does not kink; honest!  Mine's *100 ft long*, too!  Flexilla is more expensive, granted, but you won't learn any new curse words with it.  mb
1,This is actually an opening for a pop up tent probably.  Its enormous and flimsy and really not suited for a seed catcher at the bottom of a bird feeder.
1,Still waiting three months on for that lawn to pop up...
1,good product. Not paying me for advertising.
1,Gone through 2 separate attempts to grow these, nothing has come up yet. I'm only 10 days into the second try, so we'll see if there's anything in the next two weeks.
1,Quality is poor at best.
1,Box came in a mess, poorly packed from shipper. Hard to say if all is there as the "easy to assemble" is NOT the case. Tons of poorly marked parts, ripped bags, parts all in same bag to be determined by measuring. I assembled the base and it is cheap, flimsy, poorly designed. . The metal shelving could easily bend if I applied any pressure at all. 75 pounds? I doubt that. I can already see I will need to use a REAL shelf and hopefully shove that inside of the thing. That's if it  will even stand without folding after I spend a few hours/days assembling all of the pieces Disappointed in the quality. I seldom get garbage from Amazon. This is one of those times. I wish I had just built something from scratch.
1,Stay away from this one... pump impeller shaft broke after one use.
1,Way too big to be of use. Sent it back.
1,Would never purchase again...had to jump through hoops to get response from cs.  Don't waste your money!
1,Very nice looking but parts rusted
1,Owned this for a bit over five years and like most others, irrecoverable error.  Will cost almost as much to fix as a new pump will cost.  Shame on Hayward for not helping customers that are all suffering from the same issues.  By help I would mean not making the cost of a repair so expensive or discounting a replacement pump the cost of the actual repair (i.e. you want to charge me $700-800 then discount a new pump 700 if you will not have a reasonable 100-200 repair cost).  I will not purchase another Hayward product.
1,I was trying to solve the problem of a tight hose angle at the faucet (i.e., a lead hose for my wall mounted hose reel).  This did not solve my problem because the item is too stiff and does not facilitate a gradual turn in the hose.  As a result, my lead hose is still kinked: it kinks right after attaching to this "kink protector" instead of kinking after attaching to the faucet.  Instead I will buy a product such as the "Mintcraft Swivel Gooseneck", or a similar product.  If your issue is similar to mine, I suggest you consider that alternative as well.
1,Didn't work for me--the deer just ignored them and kept on chomping on the plants that they chose to eat.  In some cases you could see where they had bent the wires holding up the repellent so they could get better access to my flowers.
1,Don't buy! We had the Hayward SP3400 EcoStar VS Variable Speed pumped installed by our previous service person...he charged us $1400 which included his labor. This was July 2015. We noticed that our x10 (wireless system) wouldn't work while the pump was working....our previous pool person couldn't figure it out. We called a technician and he said he has been going around fixing the problem because the this pump interferes with x10 systems so whenever the pump runs the wireless controls to the yard don't work! I called Hayward to let them know and they said it was something they were not aware of...they still have not put that in their manuals...		Now April 19, 2017..the pump has a 'stuck' noise and shows "System Has Stalled", the orange error lights up. I called the technician (and our new and currently pool person) who indicated that they are a piece of junk because they had this issue and indicated he would of never installed a Hayward but a Pentair Pump instead (unfortunately that was our previous pool guy)...the 1 year warranty has past and out of the $$$ we put into this piece of junk.
1,Nothing happening so far!
1,This would not work at a 2FT lift. If you need more then 1FT lift this will not work for you.
1,I am not happy with having it.	I even don't use it anymore.	My observing shows that after plunging it in, nothing was changed.
1,Seed will not come through the screen.  Using black oil sunflower seeds (small ones) birds can't get them out.  Sunflowers are sprouting at the bottom of the feedere since water can't get out fast enough.
1,The unit had nice aesthetics, worked well, when it worked.		My wife is pregnant and with Zika coming on, i put two in our townhome.  One on each floor, the bugs would pop loudly when zapped....		Within 4-5 months of constant use though... one lamp died and then thr 2nd unit.		Damn there goes $80
1,Worthless. I've reset the thermometer at least 10 times. The temperature shown always ranges between 60 and 70 regardless of how cold or hot it is. Don't waste your money. I missed the return window by a day, so I'm stuck with this stupid thing.
1,Once the squirrels figure out how to defeat this baffler they do like sitting on the flat top and go about eating the food for the birds.
1,ordered two of them..both read the temp inside but outside they were both way off...sometimes 10 degrees or more...
1,Seeds did not germinate.
1,Not a single sprout.  I understand that the seed itself is only a part of the equation to growing grass (water, sunlight, soil) but i got nothing.
1,Had less than a year already tearing. Cant take the weather.
1,Not very good, not sturdy enough to do much
1,I have never giving such a bad review on a product. But by the pictures, you can see why.
1,I never put them up, because they have to be applied on the OUTSIDE of the window.  I would have gotten cheaper decals for inside if I had known this.  I'll put them up in Spring and see how they work.
1,cheap. worked for 6 days
1,As soon as I received these, I hung one inside my chicken coop where the flies are.  As of today which is the fourth day, not one fly went in the trap even tho it really stinks to high heavens.  Just wasted my money on this non working trap.
1,Reliable product, but pricey. Watch for sale/promo prices.
1,No idea what this would have been like.
1,too flimsy, pay the extra and get something else. Also, the smaller bug pass thru the net.
1,Wire keeps getting thinner and thinner.  Rust started to form within a few weeks.
1,Got this fountain yesterday. Installation was easy. You basically have to plug all returns to get a decent fountain spray. But that could damage your pump because of back pressure. But even then no lights came on. Returned the fountain today without any hassle. It's not what I expected.
1,Sunk right to the bottom of the pool when we first put it in. Fixed it by cutting off a small ring from a noodle and slip it on.
1,Was going to purchase this flag for Halloween coming up, but the shipping cost was WAY too high.  This could easily be shipped cheaper.  I hate how you don't know the actual cost until you've gone through the entire process to purchase it.  Waste of my time.
1,very week, battery won't last more than 1/2 hour of use after fully set on charger after it arrived for almost a week. Doesn't have enough strength to really do a good job of edging..maybe it trims some light grass on a postage stamp size house lot.
1,These are for charcoal grills only. They do not fit in smoker boxes.  They burn for a long time so probably best for an actual smoker not a BBQ.
1,I bought two and one broke (the handle came off) the first time I tried to use it. I'm not impressed.
1,I have used these with other mouse traps and these are the only ones to catch zero mice. So I do not recommend these traps.
1,Update and last 2/4/2012:	I LOVE doing bsiness with Amazon. The original product is being returned and the crappy refurbished replacement is being sent back to the manufacturer. I would avoid this tiller unless you are just scraping 2" off the top. I really had my hopes up for an electric, but now will be going gas.		Update 2/3/2012:	My replacement came about an hour ago. First, the replacement,for the one that ran just 30 minutes total in 10 minute spurts, was a REFURBISHED one that could have been picked up from their site for $100 less! It also has a ONE year warranty versus the original 2-year, plus the wheel cap does not stay on and the plastic motor cap was broken. I will call customer service again Monday when they open up. However, I did test it out. It lasted only 12 minutes before it shut down by itself! Tomorrow I'll try again. How deep you ask? Not more than 4 inches deep. What type of extension cord? A 25' 16 gauge, well within their specs. Am I just unfortuunate to get TWO lemons? The net for today is I paid FULL price for a new one that lasted 30 minutes only to get a refurbished one to replace it that costs $100 less and IT didn't last more than 12 minutes before shutting down. NOT Quality!		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	Update 1/27/2012:	Well, today I tried again. Didn't overheat after 10 minutes. Broke instead after about 12 sq ft of tilling. The tines stopped turning while the shaft kept spinning. The manufacturer had me pull the tine/gear assemply off the main machine. The plastic gears, each slipping over a metal sprocket were fine. No problem there. When I first examine the unit, the tines had some play, about 90 degrees worth, before they caught again. After removing the tines and playing with gesrs, I got it where they were caught all the time. Reassembled. Tried out --- NOPE. Caught and spun, caught and spun, etc. Manufacturer is sending out a replacement and said the overheating could have been related - it should not have overheated in 10 minutesw. So, when it comes, I'll update this again.		--------------------------------------------- Original comments below	After reading the other comments, I thought I'd give this light weight a try considering I only want to do small patches at a time. However, my garden ground in Texas is NOT the loose, easy-to-till stuff despite growing good veggies in it for last 6 years. The tiller arrived earlier today and after a few installation glitches, e.g., they had the holes drilled in the wrong direction for securing the crossplate and basically no good instructions, I gave it a test. Temperature has been in 60's here for almost the whole week and I just finished sprinikler pipe repairs under the garden. The top 6-8 inshes was easy to dig. However, the tiller didn't like tilling 6-7 inches and overheated twice, each time after about 15 minutes, or 25-35 feet of tilling. So, you have to wait until it cools down enough before it will start again. That's about 20 minutes! Thus, I would NOT recommend this tiller for anybody who really needs a tiller and not just a cultivator. It will probably do fine for small 30-40 sq ft areas. My plan is to till the cold veggie area, then the tomato area, then the pepper area, etc. Had I known it was going to be this bad I would have applied the cost to a better gas model. I may be pessimistic, but I really don't see this tiller lasting too long considering its typical overheating problem.
1,Does not work.
1,I somehow ended up with 2 of these...that's the good news.  Bad news is they are miles apart on their readings...not even close.  If I wait a few hours I get much different readings than before.
1,Planted the seeds in the starter pots and not a single blade sprouted!  I have bought seeds at the store and seeds online, it has been my experience that I have had bad luck with seeds I bought online.
1,Worst example of a trap I have seen the trigger cant be set off by my wife let alone a squirrel. I cant believe havahart built this. With some work I might get it to catch something.
1,Applied 2 times and did not keep rabbits out of flower beds.
1,I have a small garden fountain with a pump. This product does not keep up with the algae. Very disappointed with it.
1,I don't know it was no difference
1,I bought myself and my sons each one, they aren't made like they used to be,they sold to a different company and the new company put plastic parts instead ,all 3 of them were junk within a year, my neighbor still had his he bought 15 yrs ago when they were made with steel parts.
1,Sturdy, been using it for a year now, vacuuming once a week.  All plastic parts but haven't had any problems with it yet.		18 months later, the wings entirely snapped off.  The sides are flimsy.  It was great for 18months I suppose, but it doesn't last.		Update:  just bought this one, read my review.  1000x's better than this one.  buy it.  Aquatix Pro, 14" Professional Grade vacuum head
1,Had it two weeks and the hose started leaking 10 ft from the end. According to the warranty i have to pay to ship it back and send 13.95 to cover cost if them sending a new one. Kinda makes the warranty almost useless.
1,I planted the 25 roots and only one plant survived.  It still is quite small with very little growth.  I waited a few days after reception before I planted them (if that made a difference) and I knew better than to cover the crown.
1,This product completely died within its first minute of use.  After hooking up all the connections the gun produced a weak stream of water at first, then suddenly died and could not be resuscitated.  I double-checked the circuit breaker and the outlet, no issues there.  Also hit the reset button on the plug.  No luck, the unit was dead.  Appears to be an internal short.		What really ticks me off is that the return window on this P.O.S is one month.  Due to the horrible instructions I put off assembling the unit for over a month, so now I have an expensive paperweight that I can't return.		This is the worst product I've ever bought through Amazon (out of hundreds).  If I could rate it lower than 1 star I would.
1,Returned this product because the name of the product implied it was made of bronze.  The top is bronze colored metal and the stake is plastic. I purchased a similar designed product that is all metal from Home Depot for $10 each.
1,I paid $99 for my Big and Easy "F".  It was missing parts and the company said that I could file a claim for the parts as soon as I sent in the receipt and paid the processing/shipping and handling to have the missing parts ship to my address. Their exact words in the email were, "Once we have received and processed your proof of purchase your pending warranty claim will be processed unless shipping and handling payment has not been collected. As outlined in your assembly manual you will be responsible for the shipping and handling charge for this warranty order."		OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BUY THE BIG AND EASY TO BE ABLE TO READ THE FINE PRINT.		I've heard others say that Char-Broil was not about customer service and now I believe it!	Purchased on 11-10-11	Assembled on 11-14-11	Registered on 11-15-11	Today 11-16-11	Found out that I have to pay again for shipping/handling parts that should have been in original purchase.		Char-Broil will NOT be at my house anymore!!!
1,There is nothing special about this bulb, it is not even a full spectrum bulb, it's just a basic 2700K bulb.		It doesn't seem any different than a 100W equivalent, 26W GE brand light bulb that I could have purchased at my local home improvement store for half the cost.
1,This pump is faulty, does not start.  And I had it professionally installed which cost me $90.  So this pump has cost me. $180 and is useless
1,I installed this thing but I have no idea as to whether it worked, or not.  I still had to add the same amount of chemicals to my spa that I did, before the Spa Stick.  It may have worked but the results were nothing to write home about.
1,these things never do a good job. rarely do they water close in and the center adjusting screw just doesn't work most of the time. on some the spray seems to go up in the air at least as much as it goes out. with this water emergency we are having you would hope Rain Bird and the like would come up with a design way more efficient than this. i am fed up with replacing NEW nozzles in an effort to find one that will stop my grass turning brown just 6 feet from the outlet.
1,Sadly, the roof of the birdhouse and the clocktower are poorly assembled. There's glue that seeped out where the clocktower meets the birdhouse and between the slats of the birdhouse and it's pooled and dried in full view which takes away from the overall appearance making it look very cheap. Rather than the cost of sending it back, I've painted over the pools of glue. My own fault, I didn't do a close-up of the birdhouse before I ordered it to see that stripes on it were pink so I painted over them to make it look better. Very disappointed in the construction of this birdhouse.
1,I bought this sprinkler at Home Depot and used it a few times last year (2011).  It pluged and then stopped moving.  This is really junk!	Why can't industry make a good, reliable sprinkler?  For that matter, why does most products now only last a short time?
1,This product proved messy and ineffective. The deer ate my hostas within a week of applying this product.
1,I've used the all metal units with success, but I believe this one is faulty. It takes way too much pressure to trigger it. There is no way to get to the trigger to fix it either. I think product quality is a real issue with these units. Some work some don't.
1,Was too big.
1,This Kalanchoe arrived in very poor condition, poorly packaged, dead looking in fact, with the little bulb edges ripped off!  I do not recommend this product!	Update:  After two weeks of being potted, these Kalanchoe plants still look bad.  They are not green but yellow in color and I have my doubts the little bulbus edges will grow back.
1,I was so disappointed in my 4-station version of this sprinkler controller I had to seek out some way to express that, and warn others about it.		Maybe I should not be surprised because at my local home depot this was the most inexpensive ... read cheapest ... sprinkler controller there was in stock.  I had a different brand which was a bit more expensive but broke within a year.  I could not see what was wrong with that one, there was nothing obviously wrong, it just stopped working, responding or doing anything.		As I said this is based on the 4-station model.  From that I have to say this is most confusing and non-intuitive method of programming anything I have ever seen.		First you set the time and date ... that is easy, but it is inconvenient as the 24-hour clock selector only goes on way, and rather slow, if you happen to be setting the time for 11pm you have to push a button while you count through the whole day from AM to PM to 11pm.		Next you select the days for watering,		The real problem is setting the times for watering.  There are 3 programs A, B and C for each station.  Within each program you set the number you minutes you want to water, and then move to the next station.  No matter what I see my controller cycles through each station at least twice currently every day and there is no clear reason why.		I have 3 stations front yard, back yard and drip irrigation system.  At 7am the front yard gets watered for 5 minutes, then at 7:30am the back yard for 10 minute and then at 8am the drip irrigation for 20 minutes.  For some unknown reason the whole cycle repeats itself after that.		I am a computer programmer and the logic behind this things seems way overly convoluted, and the ergonomics impossible.  On the other hand, even with the two waterings I just adjusted down the minutes and it is functional.  Woe be to me if I ever need to change anything.  The case is nice, it is water resistant and can lock with the included key, and the physical set up is OK.		I'd have to say given the choice over again I would pay twice to have a unit that is not clumsy and where it is simple and intuitive and I do not have to break out the manual every time I need to touch it.		Sadly I have heard from customers who get sprinkler systems installed from professionals that this is the brand they often use so the installer saves money - leaving the poor homeowner to tear their hair out when and if they ever have to touch the system to change something.  Avoid it, and if you are having someone install your system for you ask them to buy a system that is "user friendly".
1,The first one I ordered broke within 15 minutes of operation. The company sent me a replacement. The vacuuming/mulcher part worked 5 seconds before breaking but it continued to work as a blower. Now, the second time out of the box the blower doesn't work either. Unfortunately I am now a week past the return window. I wish I had returned it the first sign of problems, instead I am stuck with a $312.84 after tax mistake (I can't believe I spent that much on this). Avoid!		Oh, I almost forgot to mention that before it broke I was getting little shocks on my hand where I was holding onto the handle. Maybe there was a wiring flaw that caused it to short out and thus break? Needless to say the company will be hearing from me again for another replacement.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/B00DRBBRVU/dp/B00DRBBRVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B00DRBBRVU</a>		I see the price has dropped considerably.		Ok, so the replacement they sent me worked ok as a blower (even though the mulcher was useless) for a few more months. Then it just stopped working one day. It took me a few weeks to finally dig out the manual, find the phone number and have enough time to wade through their long wait queue to get a customer service rep. Another 20 minutes later I got a phone number for a reasonably local service department, where I was told to take the unit for servicing. So, I took it down there the next day. A few days later I got a call back with the info that the unit was in fact useless and I would be receiving a replacement in +/- 2 weeks. After 2 weeks I called the customer service department again to find out what was happening. Another long wait later the rep said she would send me the tracking info and ETA on the replacement unit via email. Well, I never got an email, a tracking number or anything from anyone there telling me what the story was.		Then yesterday, about 2 months after the start of the whole process I got the replacement. So far it turns on but I am so discouraged with this product and company I felt compelled to warn people about what the company is like and what you can expect for the supposed "year" of warranty. Yes, I got the replacement. Yay, but I will never buy anything else from this company.
1,Honestly, cant tell if it works or noT. My clones rooted but it doesnt seem like they rooted faster or with more success than without this. I can say that out of 20 clones last batch I didn't use any rooting products and I got 17 of those clones to root. This time around I did 20 again and 14 rooted with the powder. So I cant with good conscience vouch for this product.
1,Leaked all over driveway
1,Seeds did not germinate for me.  Two out of 100 germinated. Not very good
1,Nothing to rave about. it's a brush. The edges seem to work better on the Q120 than the flat part of the brush.	The brush seems to just glide over the grill and not really scrape off the "crusted food".	Go for more a the scrubby kind, where you can apply better pressure and be able to get between cracks.
1,returned did not fit
1,Seeds never sprouted. Bad quality
1,Only 2 seeds sprouted
1,This product is a brilliant idea...  but lacks quality, durability, and overall usability of the product.  Do not purchase this product.  As we have purchased probably 8 of these "PRO" hoses, all with issues, I thought perhaps this product would be responding to negative reviews and subsequent quality issues - NOT THE CASE.  If you do decide to waste your money on this product, please note that there are 2 distinct versions of the "Pro Expanding Hose".  The black lever on the hose generally means death to the hose within 1 week, my latest experience, the 1st time out the box!!!  The Red version is more sturdy and is somehow larger throughput than the other, but still, will die in a very short amount of time --- even with proper care, coddling, and even warm hugs!!!  I cannot tell you how disapointed I am in a product that has such a GREAT idea, only to not be able to construct a product we, the consumer can depend on for any amount of time.  SAD and now must resort to old-style hoses that I can depend on for more than 3-4 months.
1,Works better than most on crabgrass. Yellowed the Bermuda grass. I am hoping it comes back
1,Junk,  fell apart
1,Did not grow.
1,The pool company convinced me this was the way to go to keep chlorine use down while still offering protection from algae. Pure marketing hype and not backed by science. This last year I moved to ONLY chlorine bleach, baking soda, and muriatic acid as pool chemicals and had no algae issues at all. The previous 6 years of pool maintenance always included some algae issues which probably cost $350 annually to clear up. The Nature2 lulls you into a false sense of security but really puts your pool chemistry into a precariously fragile state because of the low chlorine levels it recommends. Forget that, save money and have fewer headaches. I now have a Trouble Free Pool. In fact, do a web search on those words and you'll find the user supported site that helped me kick my reliance on useless chemical solutions to pool maintenance problems.
1,Great idea but after a week it was obvious that it was going to be trouble. 3/7 days the pump was laboring because there was not enough water flow going through. Yes, it's pollen season and the oak pollen is a choir as are the frogs BUT it should be able to handle the flow overnight without potential pump damage.
1,Leaks !!
1,Item received quickly and fit well.  An excellent and sturdy grill cover.  UPDATE.......Item lasted only a year at my home in Central Florida...Advertised that it would hold up to weather and sun....My cover was destroyed by sun and weather, mostly sun.
1,They don't burn well at all.  I don't hear any crackle.  Once, I closed my glass fireplace doors and went to bed b/c The log looked grey and finished.  The next day when I went to close the flue and sweep, there were red coals that were still alive!
1,Product overly hyped.  Does not do what is claimed.  Poor performance.  Disappointed
1,The flag was really thin.  Could easily make out facial features of my son on the other side looking through it without additional lighting.  If you're just going to hang it on the wall it's fine if you don't mind being able to see the poor match-up of fabric near the grommets through the white.
1,never buy a Hayward Product
1,After about a year and a half, this was brittle and starting to develop holes in it. It was also not super easy to put on.  For the money, this is not a worthy purchase. it also holds a lot of water on top that will just sit, I put a amazon shipping box underneath it to help the water run off. It also hold humidity that causes mold inside the grill. With this cover you need to open it up a couple of time during the winter and turn the gas on and get it dry.  I am disappointed I wasted money on the Weber brand cover. Now this cover is in the trash. I replaced it with a  ( Classic Accessories 55-421-015101-EC Ravenna Grill Cover For The Weber Performer ).  The Ravenna is a more flexible waterproof cloth that goes on with ease and has a breathing vent as well. Take a look at that before you spend your money on the Weber cover.
1,Wish I had not bought these! They're just small pieces of plastic. Took forever to receive them as well.
1,This item didn't work for me.  Light comes on when it is outside of the water.  However, it does not work in the pool.  If anything is in between the magnets, the light doesn't work.  Also, the light is not bright at all.  Very dim, like a 10w light bulb.
1,The sprayer won't build up any pressure so doesn't work
1,this was nice for one week and then stopped working properly of by 50 to 100 degrees
1,as it turns out the hose is does not reach where i needed it to reach,gonna request to return it for credit you lose a lot of lenght with the coil part,other than that the hose is okay i just could not make it work for me
1,The frame was useless.  It arrived incorrectly strung so that I couldn't use it to hang the light.  One end was pulled all the way out with no way to get it into the correct position.  When I tried to pull I back apart the flimsy plastic coupling snapped making the entire frame unusable.  I rigged up a my own frame.  I still gave this 2 stars because the light works fine.
1,Does not work on my Brinkmann grill but I can see how it would be good for a different burner arrangement.		Update on 8/9/16: Bought this thing in May of last year.  I kept it in the grill because it would let out a little smoke when the grill was used for a long time. It is completely rusted apart.  Consider buying the stainless steel models for a couple of dollars more.  This was useless and they should be ashamed of selling it.  .
1,not even close to fitting my blower as they said it would. like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole
1,Too rickety. Once it is set, it will be okay as long as it is not bumped ever. The smallest bump can cause it to shift.
1,I could not believe the poor quality of this brush. It was made in the USA but not of the expected high quality of other USA made products I have purchased recently. A piece of wire and a few spongy looking strips add up to a waste of money. This loser came apart during first use. After throwing this piece of junk away I went to the Dollar Tree and for a single buck got a multi-purpose brush that looks like a Rolls Royce compared to this Perky Pet jalopy. I have been a Perky Pet fan but if this is what they are putting out these days I will become an ex-fan. If you have access to a Dollar Tree go get a brush that will do what this brush does and much more all for a single dollar.
1,I thought these would help my wife water her plants, but all 3 I bought failed at the joint between the hose and plastic connector.  Worst hose ever.  Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Defective 2nd trap and by the time I went to use it it was past return date!!!
1,Item works as stated but does not fully recoil unless pulled at a specific angle. It does the job but is much lighter and had plastic parts compared to the metal original.
1,SLOW GROWING AND SMALL
1,Why why why don't I listen to my inner voice? Last summer and again in Mid-March 2012, I applied Bayer's super-duper All in One Lawn Weed & Crabgrass Killer Read-to-Spray--and then I watched the weeds and crabgrass in my lawn shrug with indifference. I think I actually heard some of them laughing.		About five years ago, Bayer sold kick-butt products. One spray and your weeds were history. Since then, I do not know if Bayer Inc has switched formulations or outsourced production or what, but I can't get my Bayer products to work right. And let's face it: Correctly applying a pre-mixed, spray-on solution is as easy as it gets. In case you're wondering, yes, this bottled product was fresh from the shelf at Lowe's. Same last year. Sadly, now it's really too late in the season to switch to a pre-emergent product.		Thanks, Bayer! You have lost all credibility.
1,I purchased two of these because of good reviews. I have lived in two neighborhoods since buying this and just now took it down as NO ONE uses this feeder.  It is a great idea maybe Buckeye birds can't figure out how to get the sunflower seeds out. Needless to say this week it will go to the trash as since I moved from over an acre to a stand alone condo I do not have this mant trees and hangers to place upwards of 12 feeders. I will keep the ones the birds like!!
1,nothing came up, very dissapointed
1,Biggest waste of money. It worked for a couple of days, and then it would spin only in direct sunlight. Partial shade was just too dark. How useful is that?
1,The attached hose is way too short not like the photo can over lay 2-3 feet,  the hose I received is only over top 1 inch, so it is too short to bend to water the top. not a good rain barrel compared to my other 5 barrels.
1,The on/off and speed control switch failed after just a few hours of operation.  This is exactly what happened to the previous (older model) I had.  I understand the switch has been a problem for others also and that TORO doesn't supply a switch as an available spare part.
1,Its Electric not gas!
1,What a bad joke. This holds no where near a 100 ft. hose.	This thing is very .... very small.	Wouldn't recommend.
1,I stopped used it. Our koi react negatively to it - as if they are drugged for a few days and made no difference to our 4000 gal pond.  Yes. we followed the instructions and the amounts.  So we filter with a skimmer and biofilter and have crystal clear water right to the bottom of the pond  You can't tell the difference between bottled water and the pond water (visually of course).  My advice is filter, filter, filter.  It's the only way and our fish are so much happier.		Update  Dec 2016 - since filtering with a bio filter CPF-180/250  (no enzymes of chemicals) our 4000 G pond is sparkling - I mean being able to see the tiniest grain of sand on the bottom of the liner.  here is short video of the Koi (Sorry about the long URL generated by Facebook) [...]
1,they Lasted like a month if that.
1,Nice looking object in the hand. Doesn't make anything like the rainbows that much cheaper prisms (including Swarovski knock-offs) produce, at five times the price. Not recommended except perhaps as jewelry. I'm surprised that the top brand in this field would sell this thing.
1,Lasted maybe 3 weeks.
1,This a temperature / Humidity gauge that is rendered ineffective by getting wet !	If too much humidity ( anyone's guess as it was in an incubator which is it's purpose) it will go wonky and be unreadable, then die.
1,CREATES A LOT OF VIBRATION CAUSING A TINGLING SENSATION TO YOUR HANDS. ANYTHING ELSE THAT THE MANUFACTURES CLAIMS IS NOT THAT MUCH OF A BENEFIT. IT'S MORE OF A NOVELTY. I'M GOING BACK TO THE LINE TRIMMING HEAD.
1,No instructions included. Poorly packaged. Does not fit regular hose or spigot. Really uncertain what this was intended for now and after having to wait several additional days due to a shipping delay, I could not possibly be more disappointed with this item.
1,I actually like it, but the company has not responded to my emails regarding replacement of the probes that went bad a few weeks ago and they claim to have a lifetime replacement guarantee, I will update if they ever get back to me.		I actually like the unit, its very nice to not have to walk over to the smoker all the time. You just set it next to you and walla. It has a ton of different adjustments and it chimes when you get to the set temp.		It is especially nice to have the second probe for the other "thing" in the oven.		Too bad its useless now that the probes are bad. I have had this for about 7 months now.
1,INSTALLED THEM APPROX. A MONTH AGO AND STILL HAVE GOPHERS WITHIN THE SWEENEY'S SOUND RANGE. I AM GOING TO MOVE THEM TO ANOTHER LOCATION. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL WORK. I LOVE THE BATTERY CONCEPT. THE REASON FOR BUYING THESE MY SOLAR ONES ONLY LASTED A COUPLE YEARS.
1,It killed the little weed in a couple of days (no way I saw any effect in 12 hours) the larger weeds didn't seem to be faced by it and I poured quite a bit of the thing.  It's been 4 days, so I don't think they will die at all.  Really disappointed.
1,Worthless junk. As others have stated in their reviews it never reads anything other then 7.0. I've tried using it on house plants and even outside but it always read 7 which means it's not working. Dont waist your money!
1,out of all the stuff i ordered from these people this was the one thing i was really wanting to come up but like the rest of my order from these people it didn't come up
1,Wish it would assemble into double decker mode! For the life of me, I can't get the two sections connected. I've read the directions and am no klutz, but it eludes me.		This is not my first Perky Pet feeder and I'm using their nectar mix. Which brings up the question of why the hummers try this feeder then fly off. Guess I'll give up convenience and just revert to boiling sugar water. The birds in my neighborhood have noticed this feeder but don't use it.		Yes, the flowers are huge. Yes it's fiddly to put the parts together. Yes, the two-tier feeder is a clever idea. Yes, the places for the birds to rest while feeding seems like a good idea. But at the price of this one, I'd just buy two ordinary feeders.
1,this pump keep shut off on its on
1,Sprayer didn't work! What a mess!
1,This costs three times as much as netting that is considered fragile and lightweight, yet this is fragile with a small mesh. It could easily tangle birds and frogs. I was expecting a MUCH heavier weight with wider mesh.
1,Total piece of garbage.  Only lasted one month.  Furthermore you cannot control the width of the spread like you can on other models.  My biggest problem is the thin clear pipe the yellow female hose connector is attached to.  My wife was just attaching the hose to a quick connector I had on it, and it cracked.  We bought a spreader from Ace Hardware which is much better.
1,Zero quality, paid $1.48 to return because it's not good enough to go on the trash bin. It's better to water with the hose along.
1,We had a major wasp problem and tried many things. This didn't do anything.  I think it killed one by accident...but that's about it.		The waspinator (the fake hanging wasp nest), however, worked like a charm - we bought three more!  Hardly ever see a wasp anymore!
1,Fine for keeping kids busy... is far from "Pro". Can locate metal but not reliable. even my kids called it a POS and gave up on it.
1,Sent It Back. I Didn't Need It
1,The weld on the handle of my 10-year old bulb planter finally broke.  I bought this unit expecting it to perform as well as the planter it was replacing.  I was disappointed.  The spade-like end of the planter does a good job of  digging holes; however, I found that it is quite difficult to remove the soil from the planter.  Both ends of the Bully planter appear to be about the same diameter, which causes the soil to compact in the tube.  The top of my old planter is about 1/2" larger in diameter than the bottom of the tube, which makes it relatively easy to turn the planter upside down and push the soil plug out and into the hole with the bulb.
1,This was not up to the Blackstone quality I expect. First I was shorted two M4-1 screws and one of my hitch pins was missing its locking ball so the hitch pin completely unusable. Also the corner brackets do not lay flush/snug with the grill and now my griddle does not lay flat. One back corner of the griddle now sits over 1/2 inch higher than the other because of the gap between the bracket and the grill.  I'm going to have to removed everything and see if I can bend the brackets to make them fit better. The product itself will function, but I'm am disappointed in the quality and missing parts.		**Edited to drop to two stars. When I pulled out the one good hitch pin to use the surface for the first time - the locking ball when flying out. Cheap low quality parts were used on this, which is sad considering that Blackstone is charging!
1,GARBAGE! Keep Shopping.		This is NOT a 9 foot umbrella, it barely clears 8 ft. The fabric Is unbelievably lightweight. The sun glares through it and the rain pours through it. All of the components are small scale and lightweight compared to other umbrellas. It is a merely a decorative umbrella.
1,For 3 hours it worked about as well as you could expect, then it stopped working altogether. :((((
1,this unit is okay for home use .. or small very very small job..	it eats batteries quickly.. i was not even halfway thru cleaning and battery is gone...		gas powered are much much better
1,The Panel has indentations and dents all over the cell side , that looks so badly, Used as if it went the an hale storm .
1,I bought this because it said, "people who buy this (a Pondmaster PM24 Pump) also bought this" (this filter).		Well, it doesn't fit the pump and after two visits to Lowes and two experienced salesmen, there's nothing that will link this filter to the pump.  He said he thought it must be a metric measurement on the opening.
1,not tall enough
1,Didnt grow
1,Good design, just the right size, but very poor (made in China) quality. Half of the fabric is attached to a portion of the rim in front the other half to a portion of the back of the rim (not by design but by mistake, poor manufacturing, and poor quality control). Let's see how long it lasts...
1,nothing has come up yet purchased great soil and it is in the sun part of the day and shade part	Live in fla so l guess hard to grow flowers here
1,First of all, this is not the same chemical as the older Cutter Backyard Bug Control from a few years back. On Amazon it says this product is "2.5% Permethrin," however it is now made with 0.16% Lambda-Cyhalothrin. I don't think it works as well as the older product.		The dispensing mechanism is messed up on all of these newer bottles. I was able to fix it by drilling out the hole in the nozzle where the dispensing straw is attached with a 1/8" drill bit. You have to turn the white selector knob to full-on before you drill and you have to stop drilling when you get through the white part. See my photos. After doing this, I reconnected everything and turned on the hose. After a couple of taps on the side of the bottle, the product dispensed just like it is supposed to.
1,Complete scam.nothing grows
1,Didn't work for me. I had to light more and more to get my Big Green Egg going. Never had this experience with Big Green Egg starters. Same Charcoal that I always use. Ended up using 4 bricks and had to add wood chips to get a 'fire'. I was very frustrated!
1,I didn't like the ergonomics to start with, then the weeder broke maybe 20 minutes into using it...just snapped in the middle and I wasn't even being that hard on it. I was rather shocked at the lack of quality given I have had great success with other Corona tools.
1,Horrible smell. Totally ineffective.
1,I had nurse them back to health. The shipping was horrible. The plants were damaged at arrival, some branches broken and they are so small to go through that. They had no moisture or anything. I thought they were going to die, I had to pot them and nurse them. Now they have come back but are still really small, just recuperating still. I order roses and hibiscus online a lot and I can recommend bagging around the bases with a heavy top layer of moisture barrier on the soil surface and loose taping around the plant base so it can be easily cut. Also, cardboard tube or stiff butcher wrap each plant around the pot to keep the leaves and branches from ripping off. Then label each with a sticker and include your care sheets. Leaving the plants without moisture, masking taping the tops of the pots and tossing the plants in a box with peanuts is really unacceptable. I couldn't even tell which plant was which until the foliage grew back.
1,Doesn't work.
1,I would give these ZERO stars if the option was available.  These are blue pieces of some sort of plastic.  100 pieces is about 3 cubic inches (more or less) of these plastic bits. After following the directions and giving them plenty of sun, NOTHING.  Besides, one package wasn't enough to be of use.  They are worthless.  I didn't return them as I wasn't about to waste time crawling around my trees to collect them.  I feel like I was a dupe for buying them, which probably explains why I'm apparently the first sucker to buy them!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
1,I know you get what you pay for, but this is about as heavy weight as a 2 liter pop bottle. Cracked it just trying to snap it together!
1,Didn't really work
1,Disappointed. Not even 1 seed produced.
1,Barely create smoke and does not burn efficiently.
1,It came in a 4 " pot per the description, but the plant growing from the pot was TINY. It must have been a seedling only a few weeks old at most, not at all what's expected from a plant sold based on the pot size. Only two "true leaves" on the seedling. The plant was very clearly far too young and tender to handle being boxed and shipped across the country without being traumatized.		I ordered is expecting that the 4" pot meant a better-established plant... the type of plant that is large enough that it needs that pot size for its' root system. I did not want to deal with nursing a seedling into a mature plant in this case. I've got plenty of those in progress right now, I just wanted a young well-established plant that was hardy enough to transplant into my garden immediately. That is not what I received though.		"9GreenBox" seems to be hit-and-miss. Some plants I've bought from them were awesome, extremely healthy, transplanted easily with little shock, and have absolutely exploded in new growth. A handful of plants have been either extremely stressed from shipping, died shortly after transplant, or were seedlings not yet fully established that were sold as hardy live plants.
1,turned it on one afternoon and one of the ends Blew off,  had to glue it, hope it hold  For what I paid, it should have at least lasted a season
1,STOPPED ZAPPING! I set it up and plugged it in and it zapped bugs like crazy. 30 minutes later I went back out to the yard and everything was suspiciously silent. The bulb was on...bright as when I first turned it on. Bugs were still buzzing all around it, but the zapping noise had completely stopped. Upon closer inspection, I saw insects crawling around the grid with impunity. I'll take a closer look in the daylight, but for now I'm very disappointed.		UPDATE: I took it apart today. Fairly simple affair. Doesn't seem to be much to go wrong. Couldn't figure out why that little transformer wasn't electrifying the grid. Tried to call the 800 number they tell you to call first before sending the unit back. That's when I found out that customer service ends at 4:30 PM. I was too late. You would think their customer service works on an early evening shift considering that anyone running into a problem with this thing would do so AFTER sunset. VERY FRUSTRATING!		UPDATE: I'm upping my rating from one to three stars. Flowtron IS responsive if you leave a message with a call back number. The RMA procedure was quick and easy (kudos to Amazon on that). The replacement unit is up and zapping. It's killing everything that flies into it. Don't know yet how much of the casualty rate consists of mosquitoes.		UPDATE: Back down to one star. The replacement unit lasted two evenings before the grid stopped AGAIN. I wanted so badly for this to work. I'm giving this thing one last try.
1,I bought this for a strip of lawn on the side of my house that is 5 feet wide and 15 feet long. my neighbors porch  butts up right along side so I cant have water spraying all over their stuff. I was hoping this would be the answer but it wasnt. I spent a good 30 minutes adjuting the nozzles and then the hose pressure back and forth trying to get it right but never did succeed. Maybe it would be better if your space wasn't as limited as mine but it just didn't work for me.
1,Although this chipper is well built, it is actually useless unless you want to chip up small branches.  That is the ONLY thing it does.  Leaves have to be put in one small handful at a time, and it doesn't chop them very well.  If the leaves are dry, I can crumble them with my hands much faster and much better.  I tried chopping my dried garlic stalks but they were only partially shredded.  I tried a variety of different items I wanted chopped, but I could chop faster and better by hand, except for small branches.  It did a good job of making mulch from small branches.  That's all.
1,waste of money
1,Hummers will not use it.  Have been feeding multiple hummingbirds with inexpensive feeders from Lowes and Walmart for years.  Wanted something I could clean more efficiently for the hummers sake.  Problem is they won't eat from it.  Has been hanging for two weeks in the same place as one of the inexpensive feeders hung with no customers.  Changed the nectar twice to keep it fresh.  Still no hummers.  Too bad.
1,didn't work... :(
1,This was supposed to be  easy to us, but I am too small to throw the snow as they show in the advertisements. Better for a big man.
1,It blew apart after several uses...was replaced and did the same thing.
1,It has holes all over it! So far I've had to cut off about 6 feet due to leaks and found anothe hole today.
1,I purchased this to use on the side of the building near our swimming pool... I also purchased the 18-inch Metal Outdoor Clock, which works great.  This is both smaller and lighter than the clock, and the coil on the back of the thermometer portion is directly exposed to the building or mounting surface.  I'm not sure what happened, but within a few days the coil became fouled and the thermometer was basically ruined.  I spent about an hour working with it, trying to get the coil back in place where the temperature is displayed correctly, and I had moderate success.  Unlike other outdoor thermometers I've purchased, there's no "adjustment" to the temperature... if it's 5 degrees off, there's nothing you can do about it.  The humidity gauge, however, works great!		I doubt I would buy this again.  It's inexpensive, but the quality of the construction definitely reflects that.
1,The pipe wall is very weak, can't be last one year.
1,This pump only lasted one season with minimal use and proper care.  Now, the motor still runs but is not strong enough to pump water through the hose.  Wish I spend more on a better pump.
1,sucks, don't bother, look elsewhere
1,I have this for 18 months, realized it started showing crack lines within the first year. I just realized it was still within its 3-year warranty and called to get a replacement. CSR got my serial number for the grill and told me I will get a new cover in about 5-8 days. Hope the new one will last.
1,A piece was broken, it was cheap and flimsy, don't waste your money!
1,Super small, and is not looking well. Sorry  but you find cheaper one's in your nearby store
1,Very short, very flexible stakes which do not  grip 1/4" tubing tightly enough to hold it in place. I tried to use them but gave up quickly. They bend if they encounter any resistance greater then damp, fluffy potting soil and even if you do get them in the ground the slightest movement will pop the tubing out of the clip. They are very expensive for such a cheap plastic product.
1,These traps have a very good design. Too bad the quality is garbage. One broke the first time I pressed it to set it. The place that it pivots to spring back broke right off.	The other two broke after setting them two times.	These are a piece of junk.	I then bought D-Con 00027 Ultra Set Covered Snap Mouse Trap. They work GREAT and are RE-USABLE.	They didn't fall apart after one use, or in my case, while setting it before having a chance to use it.
1,simply does not stop deer from munching on anything!
1,Bought this just over a year ago and now the motor is making noise and vibrating like it's going to stop. Will not buy Toro again.
1,The display screen never came up. After trying 8 different batteries in the display unit alone, I was convinced that it was defective. It was not the fault of the batteries because the light came on on the outdoor sensor unit and I got several beeps off of the master unit.		I really like the idea of having an outside measuring device that I did not have to go outside to read but could do it from inside. Since other reviewers had trouble I can only attribute it to poor quality in manufacturing and no testing.
1,Not that great of a product, Hard to install and not for all yards because you need 3 tall posts which can stand the wind. Doesn't offer cover from rain at all. they look OK quality is Eh
1,these did not help at all..a waste of money
1,Did not grow.
1,Hose Broke after 40 Days!!!		Don't Buy		I want my $$$ back.
1,I bought 2 single chair covers and 1 Double chair along with 1 umbrella cover. These covers are heavy but they will only last a couple of Seasons. I used them about 3 years only in June,July and August (I bring the chairs in after the summer). After a while the plastic stars getting hard and cracks. Before I new it the were all cracked and torn. Its a shame because I was very happy with them and thought they would last.
1,leaks bad around the head - gets water all over you
1,OK,...This hose sucks. Non-stop kinks, and it's bulging out with weird lumps all over the place. The weird thing is, I have one of their green colored hoses that I bought a year or two  before that I love. Never kinks, no bulges. If they know how to make a hose that doesn't kink and bulge, why don't they make all of their hoses that way?
1,I did not buy this mower through Amazon.  I paid full retail at Lowe's (less than price here).  I've had it for two weeks and three mowings, now, and am deeply disappointed for several reasons.		First up is power, or lack of it, in this machine.  None of the advertising discloses the maximum grade of 12 degrees that this mower can handle.  It's in the book, but you can't see the book until the machine is delivered.  My front yard has a maximum grade of 10 degrees and the mower bogs down, even stops, on this bitty hill.  Even with the blade disengaged.		Speed control is less than optimal.  Much less.  The mower has 6 gears, but to change from one to another the mower must be stopped and brake applied.  There is a throttle control lever on the left side that does a good job, but no matter what gear or throttle level, the mower jumps forward (or backwards) when the brake is released no matter how slowly or carefully the foot is raised to release it.  This can be dangerous if the operator's attention is not completely focused on the mower.		It is a gas hog.  Put one gallon of gas in the tank and ran it up and down the street until gas was gone.  Covered 3/4 of a mile according to GPS.  Did same experiment with friend's JD lawn tractor - more than 100 pounds heavier and an engine twice as big as the Troy-Bilt.  JD traveled just over a mile.  These tests were performed at maximum throttle and under no load conditions:  blades disengaged and a 200 pound driver.		Braking is counterintuitive - operator must use left foot to release/set brake - opposite that of an automobile.  No matter how careful, or slowly the brake is released and even at lowest throttle setting, the mower lurches forward like a drunk rabbit.  This I consider a grave safety issue.		Tires are OK for flat surfaces, but do not have enough traction to overcome a 10 degree slope despite the manual's declaration it will handle a 12 degree slope.		Shifting from forward to reverse, or into/out of neutral, is at best difficult.  The shifting lever is situated between the operators thighs, is much too short, The stops for the lever in all three positions is the red plastic that covers the engine.  Although the plastic is thicker at those points, I foresee the plastic breaking in just a couple months at thinner areas just beyond the stops.		The mower does not cut evenly at speeds lower than approximately 75% maximum.  Paragraph 1 comes back into play - insufficient power to do the job it is supposed to do - cut the grass.  At lower engine speeds the blade does not spin fast enough to cut grass - it just beats some of the blades into submission.		The method of permitting cutting while driving the mower in reverse does not engage every time and does not drop out of engagement once the mower is shifted into 'forward' which defeats the purpose of the feature.		Vibration is also a concern.  My legs, back, and arms are sore for hours after riding this mower.  It will come close to shaking the fillings in your teeth loose.		Other than the two safety concerns (jackrabbit starts and 'reverse mowing' feature) this is probably a wonderful little mower for perfectly flat perfectly smooth yards with no obstacles to drive around (think billiards table), but I have a "normal" yard.  It has some small grades to navigate, some not-so-smooth areas sprinkled about, and a few obstacles, so this mower is not for me.
1,Received seeds plants are now producing peppers but they are not the Trinidad pepper. They are banana peppers. Stay clear of this seller. Would not buy again I would give no stars.
1,I didn't even get 1 seeding from this order! DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY!!
1,It doesn't come assembled and is time consuming to assemble. The spits are not long enough. It works alright. The spits turn but they get hot so don't use bare hands. And the spits stay in their slots.
1,Whiteflies are very difficult to control let alone eliminate...they are devilish little creatures!!!		I used this product to control whiteflies in a small greenhouse (10x12x8) and it had very little effect.  It is rated for use in spaces up to 3000 cubic feet and my space is about 1000 cubic feet.  It did kill a few but only about as many as my circulating fans would have killed in the same amount of time(the fans are recommended to be off during application).  It really made next to no differecne in the whitefly population.  It also leaves an oily residue on hard surfaces.  I have also tried other Doktor Doom products and they really didn't perform well either so I shouldn't be too surprised.		CO2 dumped into a well sealed greenhouse is a much more effective approach.
1,4 panels together is only putting out 220max watts. I'll spend more on better panels next time.
1,This sign fell apart putting it in the ground  very poorly made I expected better than this being a Wilton product
1,May not be installed vertically.  Legs claim to be extendable, but cannot even support weight of empty unit when extended.  Includes "Intex adapters" that do not fit any connection on Intex prism 10' pool.  Utterly poor execution of a concept often mastered by kids at elementary school science fairs.  Fittings are also thoughtlessly located in unwise locations and preclude attractive positioning options.  Even if this heater was attachable - it's an eyesore that can't be tucked away or easily hidden and would ruin the look of my $80 wading pool.  Serious.
1,This is literally just a sponge. It doesn't do anything at all except bounce around for 15 seconds and get stuck in the filter. Have had it in the tub for two months and wash it off regularly, with zero effects. Do not buy.
1,Had one seed sprout. No flower yet, but it's been a while.  Not worth the money.
1,The device that holds the belt for the waist would slip constantly. I called the factory hoping they would help. They said to send them back. Order Husqvarna and they work great.
1,Missing parts and poor customer service (Ray - "Mr. Personality" at Weber, thanks for nothing.)  I was told it would take a week to send out missing bolts.  No thanks, back it goes.	Brand new grill, no box damage and sealed parts in plastic, yet missing several screws and washers and several parts bent badly direct from the factory.  This HAS to be foreign made.  Directions are not good either.  How about a decent YouTube video from the company instead users trying to help out with homemade videos.	I was upgrading from a smaller web gas grill which I really enjoyed.  Huge disappointment.
1,Purchased this in hopes that it would keep the flies off my horses at least for a day. Sprayed it on them and an hour later the flies were back in full force.  Will be returning.
1,First, it doesn't cover a square pattern: placed parallel to the street, one corner will not be wet, the other will flood the middle of the street.	Second, it doesn't really adjust to smaller surfaces, as the twirling depends on the water pressure, so if one has a smaller yard, there is unacceptable amount of wasted water for fairly poor coverage of the grass.	I gave it the benefit of the doubt for large lawns, but for me it is unusable!
1,Very common wild plants. The flowers are very tiny too. Yet to see a single butterfly!
1,Was not as described !!!!!
1,I only used the hose a couple of time.  It replaced a 50 heavy rubber hose in my front yard.  This morning as I was rinsing off the car the hose burst..right in the middle.  The one I got from Home Depot a month ago, for the back yard, burst right next to the hose bib so I did get wet on that one, but not this time.  These hoses are a really nice idea and convenient.  I guess there needs to be a little more thought into the external housing covering the inner hose.  It looked really funny just before it blew...kinda like blowing up balloon only this was a water balloon. At this time, I would not really recommend this hose, not sure about other manufactures thought.
1,Did not have 1000 seeds in package.
1,received product, will not power up.have notified amazon several times, on the product.
1,Hmmm...I dunno.  It certainly attracts the flies, but it doesn't necessarily kill them.  More often than killing them, at my house anyway, they were drawn to the blue ( and I might add, migraine inducing bright ) light hanging on the wall like beach - goers to the sunniest spot on the sands, lit themselves down underneath the deadly blue light on the tray that is supposed to catch their crisply fried buggy bodies and began to sunbathe.	When they felt sufficiently tanned, they would simply take flight gain through the bars,completely missing the Wal-mart inspired flickering bulbs and feast on whatever they could find in my kitchen	I thought about returning the contraption s ineffective, but am rethinking it as a burglar deterrent. Those blue lights are awful. Just awful.
1,stopped working before 1 season over.
1,This product failed after 1 1/2 years, not satisfied at all
1,It's made of some cheep flimsy tarp material but my expectations were low.  Easy to put on.  We'll see how it does after a Michigan winter.	UPDATE!!	Lasted one season.  no longer holds water.  You can see right threw it.
1,It took A LOT of this spray to kill the bigger spiders...
1,half a summer season in, and the turbo gets stuck.  not a quality product.
1,Carnivorous plant growers beware! This is not just Sphagnum Peat Moss. It contains fertilizer and WILL kill your plants. This should be listed under the item's description.
1,Bought 2 at the 'big box home improvement store' -- Both run on manual, neither will start on automatic regardless of multiple resets, and multiple different timing and interval setttings, they simply will not start in automatic.		Also not a fan of having to start it at in person at the interval start time... But not a big deal to save 10 bucks... Not that any of that matters since they are timer valves that don't work anyhow.
1,I flew this flag for about 4 hours one day and it shredded. Don't buy this flag if you plan to actually fly it. It would only be good if you just want to hang it on a wall inside. It's VERY VERY VERY thin and cheap.
1,This hose was perfect for my deck, wanted a hose without all the space.  First day it worked great.  Keep in mind that I shut the hose off and drained it after every use.  3rd use, sprung a small leak.  5th use, sprung another.  At about the 10th use, it had a massive rupture right in the middle of the hose, bows it's completely useless. Avoid at all costs
1,broke and doesn't show right temp
1,I don't like using this it is too unnatural for me. I am going to stick with Coco Coir/Perlite. I get 100% success rate every time I clone with Coco coir. I don't know why I switch back to this crap. Never again!
1,Arrived with parts missing
1,We purchased this as a replacement for the cover that came originally with our grill.  The cover fit perfectly, but did not last very long.  The original cover lasted about six years, however, this cover didn't even make it through two years before it started ripping.  It discolored badly from the sunlight.  I liked the venting and the storage pocket, but it didn't come close to expectations with regard to durability.
1,Purchased this for $20 on 6/2014.  Lasted through the summer, that's about it.  These rank right up there with Home Cheapo made in China junk.  Now this same brush is going for $7..  probably not even worth that much.
1,did not work to well
1,I love grilling during all seasons (which, in Chicago, really means four seasons of extreme weather). There's something grilling at least twice a week at my house. A good cover on my grill is necessary to protect it from rain, sleet, ice and snow, as well as harsh sunlight and heat.		This cover won't be the one. I don't recommend you buy it. Here's why:		The material itself is flimsy. It feels like the same plastic used in light windbreakers. I'm not convinced it is fire resistant. This matters in case I replace the cover before the grill has fully cooled (in real life, this sometimes happens). Also, this matters if an ember finds it way over the side on my deck where I'd lay it while grilling. That also happens in real life usage of a grill. I don't expect it to last even two years.		Meanwhile, there are vents near the top. Why? I'm guessing the engineers designing the thing never weather-tested it in a place where hard, windy rains fall.		The bag it comes in is completely unnecessary and a hassle. After a grill cools, the grill master should cover it. There's no reason to store it in the few hours during use. It made covering the grilling frustrating as the attached bag flopped around.		It is lightweight, fit well enough, and the color is a nice break from the usual black. However, this is not even close to compensating for the cheapness and poor design of this cover.		Anthony Trendl	anthonytrendl.com
1,The product was defective. When I plugged it in, it started immediately and would not turn off. Very disappointed given the other reviews that were good.
1,a total piece of junk for the price. Purchased this product Back on February 15, 2016, for home use. The metal prongs just broke off from fiberglass as the wood connection rotted out.		This cultivator was used at most twice a month and never left "outside".		I have wood cultivators that have lasted 10 years.		Do not waste your money!
1,The directions say to add half a cap to a gallon. But if you look at the cap, the fill line marker is near the top of the cap. This is too obvious a problem to have slipped by quality control.
1,This seems to be a pretty good station.  Setup was relatively easy.  The outdoor temperature took awhile to show up, but after messing around with the units a bit it eventually did.  I'm a bit disappointed because it doesn't tell you what the humidity is.  On the description above it says "Comes with 1 wireless temperature/humidity sensor"...which leads you to believe the humidity is measured.  I guess if I had looked at the image a little closer I would have seen that's not the case.  Unfortunately, in the south, 90 degrees with 30% humidity is A LOT different than 90 degrees with 90% humidity, so it would have been a very helpful function to include.		Update: I have had to replace the batteries twice now on this unit.  Every time I have to replace them I have to go through the same nonsense of getting everything to synch.  It's not common sense at all and I consider it a major hassle.  I usually try it on my own and then after a day or two of no success I have to get out the manual to figure out exactly which order I have to do everything in and exactly how long I have to wait in between doing things.  This time I have not been able to get the outside temperature to work no matter what I do. I guess I'll buy a new temperature sensor.  The next time I have to buy a temperature station it will NOT be La Crosse.
1,NO GOOD
1,I purchased this blower to blow leaves off my deck and off my lawn. While it is light enough for any one to handle and is ok for blowing off hard surfaces, it has no power to blow leaves off my lawn except if there are two or three...even on the highest setting. I never even tried the lowest ones.	After returning this weakling, i purchased a sun joe iONBV, brusless, battery 40ah, blower/mulcher and could not believe the difference.	Yes, it is more expensive but worth every bit of it. This one is a total waste of money but it is lighter than son joe's.
1,did not work
1,How can you tell if this crazy thing works or not without a camera to see what's really happening.  I thought this was a waste of money.  The rats STILL came after my sweet corn.
1,The handle is flimsy and broke immediately
1,I have numerous Ontario machetes, including this one. After injuring my little finger with the D loop on the handle of another Ontario machete, and having all my smooth-handled Ontarios slip from my grasp at various times, I started to look for something better. I found it with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gerber-Bear-Grylls-Parang/dp/B0091AVTR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gerber Bear Grylls Parang</a>, which is now the only machete I use, and I use it weekly.		If you want a safer, easier-to-use item with better blade geometry, move away from the antiquated Ontario products and see the difference.		Note: I live outside the USA and have no connection to Gerber.
1,These rocks don't light up to even notice them! Save your money.
1,I originally purchased this sofa cover in November 2012 locally after purchasing separately 6 Patio armor XL chair covers (from Amazon) and originally being happy with those covers.  After dealing with the frustrations of this cover and this brand, I decided to post an updated review for this cover.		When I originally purchased both the chair covers and initially being happy with them, I later purchased this sofa cover after I added an outdoor loveseat sofa for the patio.  At the time,  I was satisfied with both the price of the cover and what I thought was the quality of the material. These seemed upon my initial purchase to be a heavy duty material as compared to the cheaper no name brand version that I had purchased for some of my chairs prior to this that didn't last a year.		And for the first 18 months the chair covers and this sofa cover did their job at keeping the elements out (mostly rain and sun as we rarely get snow in area of the southeast I live).		So why the bad rating you ask, since I had originally given the chair covers that I purchased from Amazon, 4 stars (now at 2)?  Well simply because at the 18 month mark, 3 of the chair covers ripped into pieces just from simply removing them.  Less than 3 months later, the other 3 covers ripped to pieces and a couple weeks after that (Oct 2014), this sofa cover has also ripped into pieces.  Each of these covers, including this sofa cover, ripped in my hands like I had paper in my hands just by simply touching them and didn't resemble the high quality cover that I thought I had originally purchased. Not that I expect for these to last forever, but I do expect that these covers last more and a year and half (which over half had failed by that time) and at least more than 2 years (of which all had failed) especially when rarely used.		The sad thing is that this particular sofa cover, just like a couple of the chair covers were in a shaded patio and not exposed to sun at all and very little rain as it has a deck overhead to keep most of that away (so in essence only exposed to changing temperature, which doesn't get too cold or below freezing often, for the most part).  These covers were not taken off daily and more were used for occasional use with the sofa cover being removed the least of them all.  Now all of these have gone into the garbage. I shouldn't have to pay for new covers every couple of years but unfortunately that is what I have had to do for all these covers.		As far as warranty for Patio Armor, I checked their website after the failure of the first chair covers to see if they back these covers with any type of warranty and I looked as thoroughly as I could I couldn't even find any information for any type of warranty 1 year or otherwise, so keep that in mind when purchasing.		Yes there are great reviews here as was mine, but check with those reviewers 2 years later and see if their review of the covers are the same. I would almost bet that they have covers ripping or tearing as well.		So after dealing with the failure of these covers, I went in search for a better quality cover and ultimately (no pun intended) settled on the Cover Mates Ultimas which are backed with a 7 year warranty (boat cover type quality).  The CM Ultimas are sold here on Amazon(usually about the same regular price as the manufacturer) but I have found better deals at times with offered sales direct from the manufacturer's website.  Even with sales though, the Ultimas are a bit pricier, in this case about 20 to 30 dollars more than the Patio Armor for the sofa covers.  Although the sales the CM have on occasion have from time to time help lessen the cost differential.  I suggest waiting for an offseason sale as I found them at 20 percent off when I purchased my PA replacements.  But that 20 to 30 dollars more is well spent especially if you have to replace the Patio Armor every two years versus one that is guaranteed for 7 years.  You might as well spend for the higher end cover, especially if you are looking to protect your furniture for any long period of time.  Keep in mind that CM offers other lesser quality covers as well but they aren't backed by a 7 year warranty and I cannot attest to the quality of those.  So far, I am satisfied with the Ultimas and at least not worried if they do fail as I can get them replaced under warranty.		Sorry Patio Armor, when the chair covers failed, I broke up with you and headed elsewhere.  And with the failure of this sofa cover, there is no chance we will ever get back together.  The only reason I didn't give this cover one star as it did protect for the time it did.
1,Just got off the phone with customer service. Had to email them because of a 19 minute wait time on the phone, but they did call me back. Now the rest of the story. After reading the manual, I discover the unit needs to have a high altitude jet installed. I live at 7000 feet in Colorado. They want $2.50 for the jet plus shipping. Now the kicker, their jet will still be too rich at my altitude. This will result in fouling the spark plug, increased emissions, and increased fuel usage. When I said I would send it back, the person said " that's fine, I wouldn't be the first ". Kind of makes you wonder. Too bad, seems like a nice unit other than the problem with use at altitude. Luckily I read the manual first, without using the quick start guide, so I have not added oil or gas to the unit. We will see how Amazon handles this.
1,Very heavy for 60 year old woman.
1,Not like picture,very different,not happy very little color
1,this was a mistake to purchase  the connections were awful..it leaked all the water out I collected, ans is awkward to get any water out of the bottom.  too huge to send back  I am stuck with it
1,don't waste your money, this is nothing more than a naked media filter with a hose end on it. Just buy an enclosed filter with replaceable cartridges for a few bucks more with a hose fitting on it. I feel ripped on this purchase.
1,I add water and had fly smallbugs everywhere and would like to know why..Well now my plants are dead.
1,I could have made one of these myself.  Not worth your money.  Velcro strip isn't long enough to accommodate various lengths of hoses.
1,It did not remove scum and or mold stains. Smells good but does not do the job as advertised, I had hoped but it did not come through.
1,No germination
1,Did not sprout would not order again
1,could not spiralize anything.  It's possible I was using it all wring, but I read the directions and tried three veggies.  knicked my knuckle, but could not spiralize.  Watched some you tubes.  decided to buy another brand - where the veggie goes in sideways.

While it works great to divert 99% of the rain water into the barrel, the design falls short, in my opinion, in that it does little to mitigate the water splashing out of the top of the opening before it gets to the bottom of the diverter.  Even in the "closed" position, a little water works its way out of the front of the diverter, which, over time, could cause water damage to the exterior of the house.  My observations were based on how the water flowed during a moderate rain shower.  I am suspecting it would be even more splashy during a heavy downpour.		Update:  In an effort to minimize the splashing, I inserted a piece of gutter (which I cut open lengthwise and removed the back to turn it into a piece of "flashing" for the inside) into the diverter.  Photos attached showing this modification.  Now just waiting for the next rain so I can see if it works...
1,I'm not impressed...I'm giving it two stars because, I don't know, maybe there's the TINIEST reduction. But I still have ants invading in my boxed food (and believe me, I'm putting cereal in gallon-sized Ziploc bags, etc.), and I'm just not at all aware of any real difference. We've followed the instructions, and I keep a clean household--dishes done regularly, nothing moist or sweet or crunchy or otherwise left out within any zone I've seen ants, etc.		I've waited a couple of weeks to write this, and I just expected to see SOME reduction, and this comes with spraying outside anywhere I've seen ants concentrate. I'm just not at all happy with the product, and I don't think it works.
1,This TDS meter is meant to be a match to HWD's highly successful Ph meter. Unfortunately it fails. The case offers no protection for the meter and is embossed with gaudy silver printing. The instruction sheet is printed so small it's virtually illegible. The buttons and screen are covered by a thin vinyl screen and the Hold function doesn't work. Basically it reminds me of a very cheap digital watch that you can never set right. And having spoken with "Mel" who sends you unsolicited advice on this inferior product, I'm ready to return it.
1,Product arrived 2 days after it was promised, and all 4 of the hose clamps were missing.
1,I kept hoping that these hoses would be better, but they are not!!  Don't wast your money.
1,I never received this product.  After ordering it, and I admit I got it at a good price, about $25 including free shipping (without free shipping the S&H fee was over ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS - but that didn't matter as I has free shipping).  However, after waiting WEEKS I received an email saying that this product was UNDELIVERABLE.  Yet a couple days later I received another bag of bird seed that weighed 50LBS (10lbs MORE than this sunflower seed) with no problem!  My UPS man (same reliable guy I always have) told me he never had it on the truck although the 'tracking' from Amazon said he did - I really am very unhappy with this purchase and how it was handled and have never received a good answer as to why I never received the product.  AND the same exact thing happened when my best friend purchased this - he never got it either with the exact same outcome I had!!! Bottom line is if you order this don't count on receiving it.
1,Don't waste your money on this one folks.  At least for moles or gophers, I usually don't have a problem with snakes, only small garden type, so I can't talk about that aspect of it.  The moles just mounded their dirt all around my "Repeller", or only moved over 3 or 4 feet away.  My moles are laughing at me.  Maybe a more expensive model MIGHT work, but don't know.
1,I have had nothing but trouble with this product. I bought it primarily to vacuum up leaves. I used it once for that purpose and it worked ok, but the battery ran out after 10 minutes. Any attempts to use it after that first time have led to the on/off button not operating which meant a trip to the nearest authorized dealer or not having sufficient power to suck up any leaves. The power button is now broken for the second time.
1,Worst nozzle I have ever owned.  Leaks like a sift where the turn nozzle attaches to the main throttle area.  Hard to turn the nozzle, will give your wrist a MSD.  It will wet you more than the plants....
1,1 Cup Hydrofarm ripoff.
1,DOA. such a disappointment. Assembled and was ready to get to work but then nothing happened. Tried numerous outlets and cords, nothing... wasted time on this tiller.
1,How do these seed germinate. Got starter miracle gro to sow seed and had no success whatsoever. I bet the seller will not be able to grow these seed. If they can, they must be under the watchful eye of the seed Gods.
1,Stuck together. Quality iffy.
1,Honestly, this was a waste of money. Yes, it will poke holes in the ground, and Yes, you can even rock it a few degrees from one side to the other [front to back], but....and this is a BIG BUTT..  :)  ....a spading fork will do the same, and sooooooOOOooooo much more, and FOR THE SAME PRICE [approx]. Check out this product on Amazon "Truper 30293 Tru Tough Spading Fork, 4-Tine, D-Handle, 30-Inch", as I purchased a similar product at Home Depot. Can use it as an aerator, but can also turn up soil, use it to mix in mulch, fertilizer, etc, and the D-handle makes it a breeze to use.		Wished I had gotten smarter, sooner! :)
1,Looks like a great idea. Wind blew it off on night 1. Broken. On to next product.
1,Was pretty excited when I found this product, I actually had pretty high expectations after reading some of the reviews. However, upon utilizing this approach to CO2 augmentation, I was disappointed at the results. Using this as directed, in a very small room, seemed to have little to no effect on my vegetation.
1,Excerpt from Amazon description: "The system includes 72 seed starting plugs. These OMRI-certified pre-sized drop-in plugs provide for quick, easy starts without the fuss and mess of dealing with dirt. A tall domed cover makes it perfect for starting cuttings."  *** there are NO GROW PLUGS INCLUDED!! ***	This was a Xmas gift & the one that bought it THOUGHT it was a COMPLETE kit, well it AIN'T! So now I have "the fuss and mess of dealing with dirt" - LOL	The dome fits OUTSIDE the 'waterproof' tray and will drip condensate on your work surface, mine is a wood table, so another 'waterproof' tray is needed to put this grow tray in, whats up with that? Poor design? The dome is also very thin & came with crease/dents due to shipping damage (maybe poor packaging).	The same item from the big-box store does include grow plugs and sells for about the same price, or less.	The heat mat works great, I have a thermostat with mine & am happy with both them & the waterproof tray.........	I'm only using this for seed starting so I bought plastic six packs & root riot grow plugs, the plugs will NOT work in the 72 hole insert - so it went in the Gar-bage, just cover the 6-paks with cling wrap if you want or need humidity, done, IMHO.
1,Really, why?	I know the Squirrel Buster is more expensive, but it is sturdy and well made, a good investment all around.	This product?	It's so flimsy and poorly made, I'd be shocked if it outlasts the season.	Pass.
1,The pictures are not photoshopped. They are growing different colored berries in Japan as Japan is the world's leader in exotic berries, especially strawberries. However the U.S. does not allow the importation of any type of plant material without a two year minimum quarantine and the proper certification. U.S. Customs will seize and destroy them. These strawberries DO exist however just like the white and giant strawberries.
1,I received these seeds on time and wrapped properly to ensure the seeds would be safe.  I immediately planted them as I have done with other seeds, placing each in a hydrated Jiffy peat puck.  Each was planted as directed in a domed starting tray.  I placed the tray on a heating pad for seeds and watched the moisture content daily.  After three weeks, two (2) out of thirty (30) seeds germinated.  That is a 3.3% germination rate, which tells me the seeds were not a recent crop or the rate would have been at least 80%.  I will not buy from this vendor again.
1,The ants in our house seem to have no interest whatsoever in these baits. They totally ignore them as though they aren't even there. As a test, I've gone as far as to place the ant baits directly on top of an ant colony, and it seems they even go out of their way to avoid the stuff.		Maybe our ants just don't like the bait. Maybe yours will. For us, however, these Terro liquid ant baits have proven to be worthless.
1,Got this to try to deter squirrels and chipmunks from my garden.  I have it on the strobe/ultrasonic option.  The strobe is appropriately activated by movement, and one can only guess/hope that the ultrasonic option is active.  But in any case, this does not deter either squirrels or chipmunks.  Hopefully soon nuts will become available on some of the local trees and the tomatoes I am not getting will be less interesting in the varmints. If you want to entertain your local animals with a light show, this might be the product for you.
1,We set this up 2 weeks ago at our farm in western Sonoma County. When we were unpacking it, the wind direction vain snapped off - very fragile. It took about an hour to get running. We had to reset it several times. It goes down often and needs to be reset frequently. It seems to die in heavy storms. And the worst part is it doesn't store data in the station so rain totals are meaningless - which is the reason we bought this.
1,Nothing deters a squirell, they figured out how to get "around" this unit in just a few minutes. Only thing that works is Safflower seed which they hate, unfortunately, all birds except cardinals hate it to! If you can position your feeder at least 10 ft., away from any kind of bush or shrub that the Squirrels can jump off of it might work. They just jump higher than the unit and land directly on the feeder!! I even sprayed it with lubricant and they just climbed right over it!
1,did not live
1,Failed after 1 season. Now it won't start.  Works good when it worked. I can't recommend the product.
1,As a professional grower of high-value plants in deep water culture, I can tell you that this expensive product doesn't do anything in the root zone. In some cases it just cakes up and gums up the root zone. The only beneficial microbes products I've used that I can actually see them building the root mass and health are those made by Advanced Nutrients, which is the only company run by a guy who openly admits to growing 420 and making products to help 420 growers.
1,If you can stand the smell, these do attract flies, but not that good at trapping them. Had to move the trap from back lanai out to trees in back because smell was unbearable. Work OK.
1,This is NOT sumbrella - Fades within about 4 weeks.
1,I followed the Hirt's directions that came with the Peter Pepper seeds.  Only 10 of 20 seeds actually sprouted and they all died. The sprouts only grew to 1 1/2 inches. I was very disappointed with these.		It would be nice if Hirt's offered live Peter Pepper seedlings that are 4-5 inches and ready to put in the ground.
1,cheaper plastic broke within a week.
1,Did not grow?  didn't grow last time I ordered?  I'm done....never purchasing this stuff again
1,Not reading
1,leaks on the wand connection side.  The wand connection coupler is floppy all over the place after one use.
1,junk only works part time
1,IMPOSSIBLE to clean.
1,defiantly not worth the money to weak.  Wood chips are way better.
1,This leaks terribly at both ends.  It's not just that it needed a washer, it leaks from the crimped metal part at the beginning, and at the end where it's capped.  Sending back.
1,After one year's use, the top is coming apart from being in the sun. Now after two years, the fabric is completely failed. It's total junk. Buy something else.
1,I don't like that there is so much wood and bark in the soil!
1,was so anxious to get this very expensive seed,  I bought two bags.  Have to admit ,it did reduce the squirrels but a few must have a numb tongue as they still come to the feeders.  Now ...the birds will eat the sunflower seed, leaving a mess with the shells. No one will eat the millet so now I have a royal mess around my feeders.  Back to the hulled sunflower.  This product is too expensive to have half the seed on the ground.  SIGH.	Back to the drawing board.  lew
1,Does not work at all.
1,So plastic looking, it's fine if you have hanging plants that cover the plastic/papery basket.
1,Nice product but it is not real wrought Iron . .The sheet metal slats that support the seat cushions  bent when I sat on it  and  I'm a  210 lb. male .	To me wrought Iron is heavy solid Iron railings .This  Bench is made to resemble  real wrought Iron . The frame is tubular stamped sheet metal...I feel that  when you sell a product online it would be fair to consumer to describe the product as accurately as possible.  I made my decision based on the description . There are other benches that look just like this one for much less money ,but I choose this because it was described incurrectly
1,The pole saw was promptly received and had all parts; however, the manufacturing process wasn't complete.  I hole was missing in the black plastic coupling to mount the saw to the pole.  I was able to drill one and got it assembled.  The saw dulled after a few cuts and was quickly clogged by tree sap. I won't purchase another.....
1,I ordered this neat little kit. Seemed like a great idea, but mine came brand new spinning out of round. I bought more bits thinking the one I was using had a bent shaft. It is the machine that is out of round... Worthless!
1,Dont waste your money- it did not grow so it is best to buy plants at Lowes , home depot or your local florist.
1,Seeds would not sprout. EEL
1,If you can use a grill pan that is 10 7/8" X 14" X 1.5" with lips on all four sides then it is an excellent product and I would give this five stars.  I have one and enjoy it but that isn't what I thought I was getting.in this order.  I was seeking a larger pan with three sides as shown.  Wrong description and picture.
1,Received a credit for the non functional unit promptly. I got a request to remove my first review, but I will not as if I had seen a review of this sort I would not have wasted my time on this despite the very low price. Pay a bit more and get a product that works.
1,Broke after one season of use. Both one the end snapped the other the screw stripped and allowed the back to split causing my water bill to jump by 75 dollars while we were gone on vacation and it didn't completely stop water flow
1,not a fan. wish i could return and get my money back. I tried to pull it to a shape and it's not even close. used it this fall, but will likely toss it and buy something else.
1,Nothing produced
1,Can't tell difference with or without in where these are placed on an outlet facing the doorway. Each room I have these placed in is completely empty so there are no obstructions yet I see just as many bugs as before. I don't recommend these at all.
1,Hard to read
1,Came from China and not sure what kind of plant it grew  it was  not Brussels Sprouts Disappointed
1,I don't know what we got but they were pink and deformed and unediable!
1,Don't be fooled.  This is not an American made product.  The one I received was made in Mexico, and it was obvious.  Suspect finish.  Sloppy welds.  Almost looks Chinese, in fact.		If you are looking for American made products (and hopefully you are) this is not the watering can for you.  Both Amazon and Behrens should be ashamed at this dishonest product representation, and at their lack of national pride.		Zero stars is unfortunately not an option.
1,Didn't last one season.  inner liner has multiple cracks allowing water intrusion.
1,I bought these for our Jacuzzi.  They suck.  I should have bought (and I now shall) the granules.  They STAY in a giant pill form and will NOT dissolve.  I am entirely disappointed in this lousy product.  After 2 hours of having placed one of these in the float - it was no smaller than when I put it in!  I finally took one of these giant tablets and tried grounding it up with water in my blender and it STILL would not dissolve.  I will never buy these again.
1,I'm also disappointed that the sticker is very hard to get off. I have tried "Goo Gone" and it still sticks. Took quite a while to get off.		 Really, there is no need for that type of sticker with that obnoxious adhesive. This is Amazon!		Vendor: "Get a different sticker!!
1,Couldn't hold up to 2 rain storms
1,i purchase from VISION KART wait over 3 month to received it and it nothing work	the seeds has mold.
1,Giving this hot tub 2 stars because of price, ease of set up, and how nice it is when it actually stays "inflated"....our problem is that we have had to return two of them with in 3 weeks (wal-mart), and  both times it was because it was nice and solid for a few days, then started losing air...each time my son wiped soapy water along the top, and both times the leaks, (yup more than 1 leak),  were detected where the wall seam (tan), meets the top ledge, (white)...So now I am here on Amazon reading reviews for other hot-tubs...The Homax 6 person doesn't have many reviews (4), but they r all 5 star, and it's 50 gallons bigger! $100 more...but just saving the hassle of having to the store, lug it home,  set up, tear down, "try" to get it back in the box, and to "fit" in the car....yeah....I'd rather let the UPS take it back if need be...think I'll go with that one...good luck everyone!
1,Followed instructions.  Everything died.
1,Mine struggles to raise it 5 degrees. . find a better product. . . . . . . . .
1,The package arrived late, and wether it was the shippers fault or the post office I don't know but I think the tree was in the dark box it was shipped in for far too long as it died shortly after I received it. I will not buy from here again.
1,This was a piece of crap.  Wheel was broken right out of the box.
1,The plastic nut that attaches to your hose breaks after several uses. Junk, do not purchase this. I found this product to be much better, MADE in USA all metal!  Dramm 12353 Heavy-Duty Brass Shut-Off Valve.
1,This is plastic.  It wouldn't go though the snow that was ice crested.	It may be god for light fluffy snow but we don't get much of that.	It would be better if the blades were some kind of metal.	That way you wouldn't be worried that they would just break off if the snow got heavy.
1,CHINESE DECEPTION! DO NOT ORDER! YOU WILL GET SCREWED!
1,Falling appart and does not let the water through. Bought this base on someone's review the water was actually not staying on top of cover... so wrong....
1,Full disclosure: my mower was purchased from Lowes, not Amazon, but the review is relevant for anyone considering this product.		I love this mower, or at least I did until 5 uses in, pieces of plastic started breaking. Five uses? Sounds like I should make a warranty claim. I brought it to my local dealer, after being told my Lowes extended warranty wouldn't cover the poorly manufactured pieces breaking. Husqvarna denied my warranty claim (reasons unknown since they would not disclose them to me or the dealer), so I had to pay for my repairs.		This would be fine if I neglected or abused the mower. However, having a wheel adjustment lever snap in half because I used it, doesn't leave me with a lot of confidence. Having a screw that holds the rear skirt on, fall off twice (the second time lost forever) because the manufacturer stripped the threads, also constitutes owner abuse. Having a piece of plastic inside the side mulch door that keeps the lock secure break because I slid the lock to unlock, then back to lock after I cleaned out the chute, you guessed it, abuse.		Husqvarna support is a joke. My case was "escalated" immediately, but the escalated rep literally did nothing but call the dealer and confirm what I said. "Where can I go from here, can I appeal the warranty denial?" No. "Can you get in touch with that department and find out why I was denied coverage?" No. The rep flat out told me that I broke pieces that aren't supposed to break, therefore it is my fault. Except, I'm an honest person, and can assure anyone thinking of buying this mower, they will break on your mower just as they broke on mine; with normal, everyday usage. In fact, when I searched for HU725awd BBC, most of my broken parts came up within the first 5 search results after the mower.		Lighter note: the Briggs and Straton motor performed admirably, always turning over with no more than 2 pulls, mostly 1. I never really bogged down the motor aside from thick leaves, and even still it made it through without overheat or shutdown. So, if you are looking for a reliable mower, look for another brand that uses this motor so you don't end up with a lot of broken plastic parts. Hopefully, my string trimmer and snow thrower, also Husq, will fair better. Otherwise, I'll be having a very orange garage sale and be done with Husq once and for all.
1,Received the gnome on time but it's right hand pointing finger has been damaged  and fixed..looks bad!!!
1,there is no way this will hold a normal 100 foot hose..it is very tiny..maybe if the hose was a flat one it might but that is even pushing it..I returned it.
1,Tried this in two plants, was able to find the plant in the iPhone app but was never able to sync it.		Maybe I got a dud.
1,I wanted to grow squash in the car but a pot smoking friend of mine somehow got some mariquana seeds in the bags and it just took a quick shower with the top down while I was at work.  All of a sudden in the police parking lot I went to eat my lunch in the car and noticed a big bush filling up the back seat.  I quickly said, this is not squash and tugged on the plant till it whipped out of the bags and bunched it all up under a police vehicle.  Went back to the office shaking like a leaf alright.  Cause I took a master gardeners course and put everything you can think of in the soil mix.  It would grow stuff in the arctic.
1,This is the fourth batch of seeds i tried .there aren't enough in the pack(tiny pack of 10) to get even one live sprout. I got weeds one of the tries .the weeds grew fine.
1,I have had this for less than a year, and now I have to junk it.  It has utterly failed to live up to expectations.  It routinely gets caught on our pool steps, fails to vacuum the entire pool (it seems to cover the same lines repeatedly and misses parts of the pool consistently).  It has also worn a hole in the plastic pipe above the "steering wheel" bumper that is supposed to keep it from getting trapped, but doesn't work.  When the Baracuda gets stuck, it keeps jerking around without moving, and rubs up against the cement stairs.  It did that for several months, until the plastic pipe eventually wore through.  Now it works for about a half hour, and then just stops.  I shake it, and it goes for another little while and stops again.  I tried replacing the plastic diaphragm, but no luck, so I am through.  It's an expensive lesson, but lesson learned.		We had a Hayward PoolVac, and that had some issues, too, but the ones we had usually lasted a couple of years before they began to wear out.  At least they cleaned the entire pool and rarely, if ever, got stuck.  I know that I am throwing out the Baracuda; I do not know what I am going to get to replace it, but I suspect I'll go back to the Hayward.
1,Started off with a defective regulator that caused little CO2 to be given off and few mosquitoes caught.  Then control unit died.  Both replaced but than the unit died completely outside warranty.  Was fairly effective once it worked properly, but for the price I expect it to last more than one season without breaking down.  Like other similar brands it is expensive and prone to malfunction.
1,I was not happy with this product.....it only worked the first night. that was it.		hardly worth mentioning. would not recommend it.
1,The one I got has a different shape bottle then what you see here!  I like it though so I'll keep it
1,Don't bother with this poorly made flag.  For example, the interior clip at the top of the flag is made out of tearable light plastic. This is a novelty item not intended for outdoor display on a flagpole. Better flags are available that won't fade instantly and tear easily.
1,Really Not so great, opened up the big box that arrived and it has two oil pouches ,one of them exploded all over the inside of the box,all over directions box and power unit. So I assemble this, a relatively very easy thing to do and notice that a giant engine bolt is half in. One of four I believe, so I go to tighten it and see it won't budge, clearly they saw this when testing or shipping and said the heck with it and shipped anyway. So now I hook hose up after I get it going and water is spraying everywhere. They missed putting washers where your hose hooks into machine. A trip to home depo to buy some washers fixes this. Last but not least when i went to shut it off the off lever doesnt engage no matter how much you try to adjust it,mind you this is right out of the box, not good. So I am debating weather to return this , the assembly process and disregard for quality leaves a bad taste  .Says  a lot about the state of products these days, quality control and pride in what they produce is non existent. Almost everything is made like garbage
1,Make sure you read description carefully - thought this would fit the regular hose connector to sprinklers - WAY too small
1,Comes from China. Who knows if the ingredient list is accurate or if contains stuff not listed etc.. use with care. I will not buy again. Update: it doesn't work at all. Totally worthless.
1,Flys everywhere in my garage and have only caught 1 in two weeks!  Don't waste you money on this product.
1,Weber quality is great, but this design sucks. I spend more time cleaning up after the rain than I do grilling! Too bad, nice cover, other than the vents!	Vents are good, in the right places, and I am sure that a cover with a well placed vent would help the Grill last longer. However, this design is not the way to go.
1,Cheap wood, sloppy fitment, pole is starting to sag where the 2 sections join. My personal experience with  the Valley Forge brand thus far is poor, at best. Seriously, how do you make an underwhelming version of a stick?!
1,I bought this in Feb of this year and 1 week ago it just broke off at the fitting and fell to the ground . I think the fertilizer bottle is too heavy for the way this thing I made. It is made of plastic and there cannot hold up to the weight. I wrote to miracle-gro about the problem and asking for a replacement but like many of these big companies there was no response. Poor customer service rears it's ugly head once again..
1,I've now done five microgreen trials with this grow medium and my verdict is: F.		Germination is fine, but far before the 10-day mark this material cannot contain any water.		Twice-a-day misting will not keep your greens alive.  And twice per day is all microgreens should require.		I still hope to grow without soil because I want to sell my greens alive and not harvested.		But this grow medium is a fail.
1,Hard to set and use
1,They chirp. I don't know if they are effective at rodent control, but they drive *me* crazy with the chirping sound. You have to put these where you don't sleep. They do have an on/off switch, but that is not something I want to deal with. I'm disappointed.
1,Doesnt work as they say. Very disappointed and AeroGarden has even worse customer support. The will replace anything if you are willing to wait and wait and wait.
1,This spreader is total junk, DO NOT BUY if you want to spread ice melt pellets this spreader is sure to disappoint.  Based on the performance as in IT DOES NOT TURN WITH A LOAD OF ANY TYPE I would say this is a light weight grass seed spreader that would be worthless even for that task.
1,Not as impressed with this shed as some others seem to be.  While I bought mine recently, there are some changes in design from the one showing, so maybe mine was from older stock.  Who knows?		Overall, it's a pretty simple shed to assemble -- after you've completed it.  I'd break it down by saying that the engineering and design are an "A" grade, manufacturing is a "C-", and instructions are a "D-".		The manufacturing on mine was sloppy.  Holes often didn't always line up like they should--sometimes on critical pieces--holes were still filled with pieces of leftover material, etc.  Also, the wonky little plastic fasteners were either too high tech for me to figure out, or they are just plain sloppy.  Since they don't really tighten down, and one that's not fastened in all the way feels pretty much like one that is, using them wasn't very reassuring.  Some of the pieces had to be made to fit with a mallet--pieces that I think should have fit more easily. Also, even though we assembled this on a framework made to their specs, level and plumb, the doors still are difficult to close.		Still, when the whole building is together, everything seems solid.  I'll find out when we have a major wind storm, I guess.		The instruction manual was VERY poorly thought out.  You have to flip back and forth between pages throughout the booklet to find what's being talked about during each step of the way.  In one case, I went through a series of steps only to be cautioned about something at the end that should have been the first thing mentioned.  In two other cases, pieces were illustrated and described very specifically in the book, but the actual parts were totally different--clearly a re-designed part that they didn't bother to update in the instructions.  In fact, the company emailed me a second book, because mine wasn't 100% correct for the product I got, but even the second manual wasn't quite right, either. So ... with two manuals, each with different parts (and some parts numbers), we were able to muddle through and assemble what looks like a shed.		Yes, you can figure it all out and make it work, and the second one would be far easier to do, but these are DIY kits that most buyers will only build one time.  The instructions should be linear, clearly written, and easy to understand as the builder steps through them.  Quality control should be FAR better.  Instruction manuals should tell you very clearly how to assemble the product--not be puzzles that have to be solved before completing many of the key steps.  Putting this together was much more of a PIA than I was expecting, and that's nearly all due to the manual being so poorly written, and design changes of parts not being updated in the manual.		In retrospect, given the time and expense required to build the foundation (I built a pressure-treated frame), and the frustration involved in getting this thing together, I would probably advise a friend to just buy one of the pre-fabricated sheds that are sold by many places  if they want a storage building without a fair amount of hassle involved.  But if you enjoy building stuff--even if you have to do a fair amount of futzing around to make things go together correctly--the finished product isn't bad.  We're modifying ours to be a chicken coop, so the vinyl material is a plus, in that it can be washed out periodically with a pressure washer.  Other than that, I'd never do one of these again.
1,The connection to the water pipe is plastic, water keep on leaking from here; the shooting distance is too short, only about 6 feet to 10 feet.	I have to return this product.
1,So far this stuff sucks . I see ants in the vacinity  but not one in any of the traps . Not sure if this is old or what the problem is . One package was already open when I received it  so I guess it was previously returned ....	Hoping to see an ant in it tomorrow	I'll change  my review if that happens
1,I really liked the idea of this aerator, in reality it hardly functioned.	The spiked were very quick compacted with soil and were a nightmare to get cleared.
1,The file works great. But don't make the same mistake I did And don't do the price search completely. Ordered two of these before I just Happen to be at the Stihl dealer today and saw these for $39. We that was disappointing. Already used both files so cant return. Facepalm!
1,They aren't large enough and the string is useless.  I tried to cook salmon with these but I learned very quickly I prefer the cedar planks way more than I do these. Waste of money, in my opinion.
1,I bought 2 of these three years ago. They are still working great. They have been out in the weather year round. they are still working great. I bought one, and it would work at all. I returned it and requested a replacement. No problem, I received at new one within one week. It worked for one week, and then the outdoor sensor quit. I took the batteries out and keep the indoor unit. I pulled the RV that had one of the original outdoor sensors on the back. The indoor immediately started receiving the transmission from the old outdoor sensor. I guess the new ones aren't as well made as the original ones. The service from Amazon was good as always.
1,Returned it. The picture appears it should fit any type of pole but it does not. My telescope pole is 2 years new and it needed to slide and clasp on but this brush has a metal piece that does not allow for this type of fit.
1,Pump works great, however, I lost the drain plug cap which is proprietary and apparently they don't sell parts to their own products. Pretty terrible customer service if you ask me.
1,Not much more to add to the headline. I live at 8,500 ft elevation and it does not start. Factory sent me to an "authorized" warranty repair center who kept telling me they would not fix it without me paying. I paid $25 to be told there was oil in the carburetor, took it home and, guess what, it would not start. Factory said it was not shipped with a high altitude kit and the "authorized" dealer said that was not a warranty item to fix. Let's see, 1st pull to start every time guaranteed and nobody to make it so without charging me. Mower is on the way back to Amazon at no charge and Lawn Boy/Toro is OFF my list for a replacement.
1,I carefully planted and tended my four plants that I received this summer.  So far, only one measly tomato!
1,Didn't read the fine print that it's not capable of double use.
1,the threads are plastic and strip easily. Buy one made of brass for a few dollars more.
1,Had three of these and one failed within months of using. Two lasted almost two years, then crapped out. No more of these for me, aside from whether these are effective for deterring the targeted rodents, as they are not reliable.		I notice that since the unit is sealed, there is humidity that builds up on the top plastic above the solar membranes. Perhaps the condensation degrades the electronics? One the condensation builds up, it seems to stay there despite changing weather.		I used a wooden round stake to create the hole for these, so there is no pounding, rather just pushing them down. So I know I didn't damage from mistreatment/cracking the unit.
1,Product arrived in open and torn box.  All items appeared to be in box.  Hardware is of low quality.  I visited my local hardware store to upgrade poor quality parts.  Foam wrap on handle bar is beginning to unravel.  I agree with another reviewer that this product was not designed to dump dirt due to its front end shape.
1,I own 3 other AcuRite wireless clock/thermometers and placed all of them on the same table.  I posted a photo in the gallery (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00GSRZHUM/ref=cm_cr_dp_cust_img_see_all_img0).  The 3 older models registered an outside temp of 61 and 62 degrees.  This one registered 79 degrees.  Am returning this one, too.  I wanted it because it's lighted and would have been good in the bedroom.		2014.03.24 - Update:  After I requested a refund on this second unit because it would not register the correct outside temp either, I took it into my kitchen to box it up for shipping back to Amazon.  I plugged it in one more time and noticed that the outside temp was beginning to register closer to what was displayed on the other AcuRite I have in the kitchen.  I think the problem with this model is that it doesn't have the radio range of my other 3 models.  The outdoor part was less that 45 feet from the unit sitting next to my bed which must have been too far.  I don't think it would register at 165 feet as advertised.  It may work if it's close to the outdoor part that wirelessly sends in the outside temp.  In my kitchen it was only about 15 feet away.		I still returned the model, however, as there is no where for me to put the outside part in the shade on a north wall.  We live in the desert and the sun is intense. Too bad cause I liked the lighted display.
1,Not good for moles they live happily after the application...
1,This just did not work. Water would leak through every aspect of the timer.  It would leak through the water faucet at the top and it would seep through the connectors at the bottom.  I switched to another brand and had no issues thereafter. I ended up returning this timer.  Very frustrating.
1,will not connect to the remote sensor.  I have repeated the process 4 times after waiting the prescribed 15 minutes,  bought new fresh batteries and tested them.  they are fine.  I have contacted la crosse tech support..  They said the would call back in 15 minutes.  that was over an hour ago to go through a reboot process.  This might just be a bad one.  >>>  I am sending this one back.  Something this new should not be this difficult to start up.
1,This is not an OEM craftsman part. Purchased this for my craftsman mower (model 917.376391) and does not fit. Returned for a refund
1,The reason that Suncast has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau is obvious to me.  They only sell two kinds of product, those that have failed and those that are going to fail.  I have purchased multiple products from them and they have a 100% failure rate within three years.  Warranty claims are difficult if not impossible, they ignore emails routinely.  I purchased the above product from a big box store, it failed immediately.  I learned my lesson this time and returned it with the 90 day return window.  I will never buy another Suncast product, they are sold as-is and at the buyers risk.
1,This is just a preliminary review based on one day's use. If I figure out what's wrong, I'll update the review. For now:		This is well-balanced, has a good reach, and the angle of the saw head makes cutting overhead branches so much easier than my old corded saw with a straight head. My good friend has one of these and I borrowed it to do some trimming of some rather large branches. It worked so well I ordered one for myself.		It has plenty of power to cut through a 3-4 inch Palo Verde limb in about 15 seconds. Of course this requires a good, sharp blade, but sufficient power to drive that blade is still required, and this 40V battery-driven saw has enough power to do what I needed it to do. The battery is big and weighs a couple of pounds, but the design of the tool puts the battery in a place where it helps balance things out and it doesn't feel heavy at all. In fact, it's easier to handle than my old, corded pole saw.		But, for some reason mine stalls out in the middle of a cut. Yes, I put oil in it, and no, it's not jamming; it just stops. It restarts immediately if I just release the trigger and pull it again. Weird.		Other than this failure (which did not affect my friend's saw) it's a great tool. Now I just need to figure out why mine shuts down. Until I do, I stand by the 2-star rating.
1,HUGE - takes up way too much space in the yard - did not fit the size hammock it said it would - too much to pay to send it back to the vendor!	More than half the cost of the frame to return it and it weighs A LOT so is not easy to handle even if you changed it repackaged for a return. . I am stuck with this hugh metal frame - so it was a waste of money for me - be VERY SURE this is what you want as once you get it there's no return happening. We sunk two wood poles in ground and hung the hammock on edge of the yard instead - now we can take it down easily - no yard space wasted.
1,did not stay inflated
1,Last year, we bought two of these hose reels based on many positive reviews, and we enjoyed using them all season long. We live in New England where our winters are cold and snowy, but this product is advertised as "Non-Rust Cast Aluminum" and is supposed to tolerate any type of climate or weather. Certainly after having bolted them to the sides of our home, we never intended to unbolt them in Autumn and take them inside for the winter. Now that spring has arrived again, we were shocked that not one, but BOTH wheel handles completely snapped off just as we attempted to attach and reel in the hoses. These items were expensive and cannot be repaired. Perhaps if they were made of something more solid, a clever repair might be possible with a drill and a strong bolt. Instead, we found that the aluminum grade used to manufacture this product is almost bendable while having chipped and splintered, making any type of repair completely out of the question. It is infuriating to spend that amount of money on a cheaply-made product owned for one single year.
1,Returned these, marked Large but way too tight on hands, plus material seemed pretty lightweight for any protection.
1,poor concept and execution. the screw that keep the two pieces together is a joke. it doesn't hold at all. doesn't fit 1.5 in square feet of cannopy. Must be <1.25 inch. had to return them.
1,And Karcher is the most popular brand of pressure washer, and old machines are what need replacement hoses, so "boo".
1,Thin metal used so if you get two mows out of these you've done good!
1,Although it would might work for a really short person or someone with better leg strength, this item was much too low to be effective for my use.
1,My rabbit ignores it.  Still eating bed plants. Does not last 30 days.
1,They are very expensive,  so buy the large boxes otherwise yur gonna pay thru the nose for what should be a reasonable value / price product.
1,The traps are too small to humanely hold a captured mouse. Mice are trapped and held in one position. Since they cannot turn around or move they become covered with their own feces and urine.		The traps balance off-center and, in theory, when a mouse enters to get the bait, the trap is unbalanced and causes the door to close.  But putting just a small amount of bait in the rear of the trap is enough to change the balance so that the door rarely stays open and the trap cannot be set.		These traps are junk and I threw them away.  Instead I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Havahart-1020-Live-Animal-Two-Door-Mouse-Cage-Trap/dp/B0000DINGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Havahart 1020 Live Animal Two-Door Mouse Cage Trap</a>&nbsp;and have used them with great success.
1,bad
1,I got the 4-pack thinking I'd place several around the house and in the drawers.  Starting with 2, I baited each with a portion of a corn chip with peanut butter, placed on the end opposite the entrance.  One was put in a drawer and the other was put in the cupboard just beneath the drawer.  When I checked several hours later the bait was gone from both, and in its place were little deposits of mouse turds. Somehow the Houdini mice managed to eat and disappear.  Rather than using these to feed the mice I'll be sending them back, complete with the mouse droppings!
1,Attractive, functional, great idea, trailing flowers and plants look great in it...but very poorly built.  Leans to one side, with no way to correct it without breaking it.
1,It does work ok, but the hoses all disintegrated quickly.  7 Year warranty is a joke, nothing is covered under it that would actually fail. They offered to have me pay to ship it back for a service estimate, instead I had to spend $30 on replacement hoses and the primer bulb and did the work myself.  HItachi customer service was HORRIBLE.
1,End blew off in the middle of the night so water ran enough to create a $200+ bill!!!
1,Feels like a cheap plastic and I'm worried it won't last very long.
1,Shipped from China, not GMO not American seeds; which makes me a little worried about consuming what grown from the seeds I plant. Also took way too long to receive the shipment.
1,Good price but I got infestation of gnats! Never had any problem before. I have plenty of potted plants in my house and now all of them have hundreds if not thousand of flying gnats! I ordered several bags. Big mistake! I will never ever order this brand again especially for indoor plants.	I have my zapper lights on 24 hours but the gnats kept coming. Kindly advise what to do if anyone have this problem too. Thanks.
1,When it's on "Full Stream", it doesn't have good pressure as I have gotten from simpler nozzles.	After 3 years, I have to buy a new one. ...leaking all around the head and no longer retracts to close.	Would I recommend it? No.
1,dry out to much soil falls out suck
1,Tossed it into the garbage!  Do NOT purchase any hummingbird mix that has red dye in it as it is harmful to the hummingbirds' eggs
1,I didn't see a reduction in the number of mosquitos. We don't even use it anymore.
1,Only lasted a few weeks and dosent work.
1,Nothing grew
1,None of the seeds germinated for me outside in Colorado this Spring.  Maybe my planting, watering, timing were the culprit though so may not be fair to rate as one star.  You may have better success.  Still I would have expected as least a few plants to come up.
1,Did not grow
1,nothing!
1,I purchased the Black & Decker NPS1018 18-Volt Cordless Electric Power Scrubber a few months ago after i got it i charged it up and then i washed my truck only to get frustrated that the head would not stay locked. I was so frustrated with it. I tried to see if something was missing but its the way it was poorly designed. Seems that black & Decker knew it but did nothing to fix the problem before dropping this off to the consumer. This is the first and last Black & Decker product i will by. For anyone looking to buy this i would not waste your money.
1,They do not last long as usual
1,Purchased one of these that had a hole on it the first use last year. company sent me a new one. just pulled the new replacement from the original packaging out to use yesterday and the hose burst out of the piping where the nozzle goes on first use. i got absolutely soaked. going in the trash.
1,not impressed
1,We bought this to replace our Weber 200 as it kept eating regulators.  I love how fast it heats up and the dual burners.  Being able to cook indirectly makes this unit better than the Weber by itself, let alone this being larger, hotter and better built.  Wish I had bought it first.  Great grill for two to four people.		We used this grill for a few months and put it away for the winter.  All of the rivets holding the horizontal plates have rusted out rendering it unusable.  This is totally unacceptable and makes me wonder what else will go wrong.
1,Before I put the cover on my grill I held it up so I could look inside.  I saw pinpoints of sunlight shining through, especially on the top part.  I won't dispute with reviewers who said their covers protected their grills through heavy rain and snow, but the one I received would have leaked like a sieve in even moderate weather.  It looks like this company has quality control problems.  If you buy a cover from them, you might want to give it  the "sunlight test" before you put it into use.
1,Failure rate is extremely high on these sure pop series sprinklers. I have over 20 of these installed in my yard and half of them have failed within 4 years. Since broken sprinklers are not necessarily noticed immediately, any failure can lead to huge wasted water costs. I've since replaced all of them with the 1800 series or unibody series sprinklers.
1,Price quadrupled in 1 year. For the  2 pack. Good blades. Fair price if you buy multi packs.
1,The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose.  Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year.  This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk.  I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price.  It looks like it will work forever.  Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8" hose.  It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.  If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a quality reel the first time.
1,This nozzle generally worked fine, for one season.  When the following spring came around, I went to use the nozzle, and nothing came out at all.  It seemed sturdy, and I expected it would hold up based on how well it did last year, but I'm replacing it after a single season, so I don't plan to cheap out this time around.		If you take extremely good care of it, it may last longer, but I won't be buying the same product to replace the one I bought last year...
1,Flimsy. I have to use two layers of this stuff. will not buy again.
1,My daughter bought this. Within 1 week squirrels had eaten the face off.
1,It had a crack right away
1,I bought the larger jar because it was a good value.  However the root gel had an expiration date 90 days from my receipt of it.  There is no way I could expect to use it in that time.  I returned it and will buy a smaller amount, in hopes that there will be a longer use period shown.
1,Defective/Does not work properly	Details: I used this for 45 minutes. I moved the hose 10 feet and the brass end pulled off of the hose. This hose does not rate 1 star. You should discontinue.		Amazon made it right!  Thank you!
1,Look elsewhere on the internet. If there are alternatives to buy 11x22 trays in bulk for around $88 then I will say this is the answer. Otherwise, go to the specialist.
1,The description did not say only a 1 foot high output of the pump.  I ordered this to replace one I had for 130 gph which shot over my fountain unless I had it set to minimum, which then clogged very soon after cleaning.  This thing only gives a dribble.  Don't order this unless you want it for an inside fountain which only needs	less then 1 foot height and only a dribble....  Wrong name for this "fountain pump"
1,Nope. Rats still here. No change at all after placing bait all over the place.
1,Like other purchasers I was shocked at how thin this "doormat" was.  When it says its like outdoor carpet, I guess its true.  Its thin like astroturf.  I'm seriously considering returning it, I feel the quality is around the $10 level.  I read the negative reviews but didn't believe them...  I was hoping for something more like a coir doormat.  Oh well.
1,Wouldn't buy again
1,Couldn't find an honest pool contractor to install this 'simple installation' product so I sent it back for a refund. Cost me money to send it back though.	One pool contractor wanted to charge me $765.00 to install because they said it was NOT a simple installation as advertised. Guess I'll have to crawl out of the spa like I've been doing for years.
1,Is Not good. I fell I lost my money.	Is weak plastic.	I don't buy this again.
1,The bottom is cracked  and the paint is chipped.  It looks like something you would buy at a garage sale.
1,Although I really liked this watering can, after two weeks it leaked all along the top of the rim at the bottom. I had to return it.
1,The smallish diameter gas burner concentrates the actual flame in a very small area which does not come close to looking natural.  Assembly was problematical and very tedious at best with mis-aligned bolt holes and captive nuts making alignment almost impossible in some areas.  The screws and bolts are unfinished and rust badly with only short term exposure to the weather and the paper-thin vinyl weather cover sent with the firepit is of the cheapest material imaginable and tears just while carefully unfolding it. We had to have a replacement cover expensively custom made at a local boat upholstery shop. The spot welds holding the inserts into the bottoms of the very thin angle iron corner legs are completely insufficient and poorly done and fail with time allowing the corners to collapse.  These inserts are located where the height adjustors for the legs screw into the base of each leg and once those cheap welds have failed it is difficult to find anyone with a low wattage welder to re-attach those inserts without blowing holes in the very thin sheet metal this firepit is made from.  For the quality, this firebowl is very overpriced. Attractive to look at but poor performance and very poorly made in China (which says it all) !
1,Absolute crap.  I returned them.  The handle is too small for the metal part it covers.  The blades are not sharp.  They just tear the meat.
1,Sorry these do not work, We feel the flashing red lights told the deer were to come and feed.
1,I wonder if it's real stainless as the looked horrible after only a few uses compare to the original 10 year old pieces
1,Great little heater... use it every night on our porch... keeps us toasty...
1,product did not work
1,Hardly lasted two days in my feeders. Too expensive to keep up with. I recommend just making your own food with sugar and water. Much more reliable when you know what you're putting in the mix. Not sure about these ingeredients and if they are truly natural.
1,returned it. hard to use
1,Did not grow
1,The chain cuts well....however when the chain jumps off the guide track it gets chewed up by the gear sprocket in the chainsaw. I have gone through three chains like this.
1,Didn't do much of anything
1,These "bells" hang in a clump.  They are papier mach painted poorly in bronze colored water-based paint.  Worst of all: THEY MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND IN THE WIND!
1,Has no perches . Missing all 12 very unhappy.
1,I had zero results with this from what I could tell. It may work right out of the bag but I suspect loses its effectiveness pretty rapidly. I know the good that snakes bring with them but I simply don't want them anywhere near me. I wish they made a product that actually worked but this isn't it.
1,I ordered this by accident.  I thought it was the Organic Fish Fertilizer.  Since I didn't read the labels, I started using this right away and sprayed my fruit trees, lawn, plants, etc with it.		When I finally noticed this wasn't the correct product, I saw on the labels that contained cancer causing chemicals.  Why in the world would anyone want to spray their lawn and fruit trees with this stuff?		Not even sure how I am suppose to dump this thing.
1,Not enough power to move leafs had to return blower got a gas power one and it works great.
1,Update #2 - A gas can should not be so much trouble.  Another year has gone by and now another failure.  This time the large nut that hold the nozzle assembly on split.  The company needs to look at the design and either install a vent mechanism to reduce internal pressure or use better material that can withstand the pressure that develops within the can in the summer.	Update - I sent the company that makes these and email about my issue and within days I had new spouts - no questions. That is great service and makes me move my evaluation up to 4.  If these new parts do not fail I give it a 5.	Original review - A friend told me about this brand and product after I complained about the lack of good gas cans that can be used without spilling.  I bought two - 2.5 g and 1.25 g.  One I use for regular gas and the other for 2 cycle mix.  Both worked great for about a year and then both developed a crack in the white spout.  The crack looks to be caused by expansion - possible due to heat in the storage shed.  No-Spill has replacement parts but I beleive I will have to buy the entire nozzel assembly.  We will see if the warrenty covers this problem and how much hassel there is with it.  I have searched the WEB and found no reference to this problem so it may be isolated.
1,does not attract ants as advertised
1,Suppose to fit the tooth on a 7/32nds chain but it doesn't so retruned..need to place up what it does fit and in the SAE system of mesurements and not digital or other calibration,had the same problem with a drill bit and had to get the diameter of the hull of a .22WMR round to get the correct bit to tap out the cylinder,this was about the same and 1 said it would work..news flash it doesn't!
1,Honestly I hate scoring these badly.  I wish for gardening there was an option just didn't work for me.  I'm sure others green thumbs can get these seeds to grow.  Some seeds were successful and some were not this planting period.		However, these just didn't grow for me.
1,I used these loppers when working for a landscaping company when we needed to cut back unwanted trees growing in someone's yard. I didn't like them, mainly because you have to open the handles to a truly absurd degree before you can open the blades enough to fit a branch in there. The simple, cheap-o store-brand loppers from Ace worked better, in my opinion.		That said, neither loppers hold a candle to the Corona FL 3420s that I picked up and have used on my property. They're less expensive and totally superior to these.
1,Took forever...low quality
1,Impossible to get the humidity reading even remotely accurate both inside and out. Extremely difficult to get customer service assistance and when you finally get hold of them they are little if any help. I am totally discouraged with La Crosse and it's products. An example of inaccuracy is my current reading. It is 14 degrees outside with humidity of 74 % yet my model C83332 shows a reading of 27 degrees and 26% humidity. Inside temp of 68degrees is accurate but humidity of 9% is way off. Another reading from another instrument shows the temp as 68 degrees but the humidity is 48%. I have a humidifier running. Impossible to be 9% humidity.
1,These roses never grew let alone sprouted. I was sad too. I'll just buy rose plants from now on instead of wasting my money doing it this way. I did everything I was supposed to.
1,I have had this station for just under a year. It is easy to set up and use but very inaccurate. The temperature indoor setting is very inaccurate, the outdoor setting is usually off from 1 to 6 degrees from others I have checked right beside it. Even when you set it the thing just goes back in a while to being inaccurate. If you want to know what the daily rainfall or rainfall from last storm was you have to catch it before it disappears which is not easy unless you can be right there all the time to catch it.	If the wind is blowing, the rain gauge doesn't catch most of the rain, sort of goes right over the top I guess.	There is no way to clear the total rain amount at the end of the year or whenever you want except to reset and then it starts the learning thing again which makes it more inaccurate.	Not worth even the reduced price I paid for it.	I wrote this but evidently forgot to submit it! It is now a couple years later. The wind gauge stopped working last year, I took it down and made sure everything was looking good inside. It worked for another week or so then same thing. I checked out the station and found it was a common problem with the station so I contacted customer service and got the same run around as everyone else did, check this and that and it should work.	Still dead after several attempts to do what they said should fix it.
1,Even with the soap valve (that controls how much soap goes through) turned all the way closed it flows so much soap that I have to refill the bottle at least 3 times for a simple car wash.
1,Ordered this in January, 2012, but had no reason to use it until March, 2012, AFTER the expiration of the Worx 30 day satisfaction guarantee and the Amazon return period.		First time out, it shocked me every time I touched it anywhere near an assembly screw.  It doesn't vacuum that well.  The reviewer who said it works okay if you only have a few leaves to vacuum is absolutely right.  I would add to that:  If you also have a lot of time to waste.  To be fair, they were cottonwood leaves, quite large, but dry and loosely piled against a wall by the wind.  I gave up after 1-1/2 bags.  I was worried about electrocution.		I called Worx customer service about the shock and also mentioned that it doesn't pick up leaves as well as is shown in the video.  They're sorry I don't like the performance, but I missed the window for the satisfaction guarantee.  Fair enough.		As to the electrical shocks, they suggested wearing gloves while operating the product.  They blamed static electricity.		For some reason, Worx is sending a replacement motor unit under the two year warranty, but since they don't expect it to change anything, it seems pointless.  Never buy on Amazon unless you can test the product in the 30 day return period.  I say that as someone who buys a lot on Amazon and should know better.  I blame myself and not Amazon.
1,Used it after a planted a bunch of dahlias. I followed the instructions and sprinkled it generously in a wide path around the garden bed, after I had planted my 30 dahlias. Next morning, many of the dahlias had been eaten to the ground, and I saw bunnies hopping around in the garden bed.		Later on in the day, my Golden retriever found it very tasty and I had to keep him inside so he would not eat it all up.		I will not be buying this product again. They offer a money back guarantee, don't really know how to claim it since I bought it on Amazon.		I would not recommend it. I will continue to use liquid fence.
1,I agree with other reviewers - I have concerns about this product and found it to be ineffective at killing pests on my plant.  The warning labels are not consistent with something i would classify as "organic."  Danger to marine life, wash your hands etc... this is clearly not like spraying your plants with soap water!		Several of my plants were experiencing bug breakouts with holes in the leaves etc... I sprayed them and 2 weeks later...still more holes.  I do like the Safer Brand products for roses and you can see my review there -- but this product leaves much to be desired.
1,With all the positive reviews, I thought I'd fall in love with this item. When the package arrived, I was disappointed to discover it was poorly made. When inspecting one of the butterflies & trying to bend it in other directions as one seller mentioned, the piece totally came apart. The butterflies look like xerox copies on paper of butterflies stuck to a coil wire & the stake is much too short for my yard.
1,Had very few germinate. Used warm frame for these starts with proper depth, good soil and proper drainage. Not impressed with their germination. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. My loss in income will be large by trusting this seller.
1,Mediocre.
1,This is a terrible item. After having it installed on my weed eater for around 2 months the fuel filter completely deteriorated causing by gas tank to be unusable due to the sticky residue left behind. The grommet that holds the duel lines turned to mush and the fuel lines fell apart in my hands. The product is made from very poor materials.
1,was not 200 hundred seeds nor did it grow not worth the money... So don't waste your time or money
1,These work great for a year or so, then the spring or whatever gets weak and they don't always turn off, leaving water running and wasted.  Good short term way to turn water off, just don't leave them unattended for long because they aren't reliable for the long term and could lead to HIGH water bills and damage.  (I have several of these)
1,Fly: 1	Fly swatter: 0		Before we killed 1 fly this piece of garbage bit the dust. The corner broke off and the handle flew off.
1,All this caught was mouse crap... Seriously. Set the trap, came back to look at it closer a week later and mouse crap fell out when I picked it up. Bought some traditional traps, hopefully they work.
1,Not a very good brush for getting into the newer V groove grills. I thought this would be a good brush since all the reviews are so positive but I find it pretty useless for my grill, the char-broil grill2go.  The spiral design of this prevents it from getting down into the bottom of the groove.  I find I am pulling out my old square pad wire brush and turning it at an angle to get it into the grooves.  This spiral pattern works good on traditional grills but not ones like Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Portable Grill2Go Gas Grill.  I would not buy this again.
1,junk
1,This is a review about Scotts Patchmaster Lawn Repair Mix.  I have a few small empty spots left over from last year and used this product on them.  The package contains mostly recycled paper.  By all appearances very little seed.  I laid down the product  and was not entirely satisfied with the coverage that I got out of it.  It is an eyesore on the lawn because it looks like crumpled up newspaper.  It's been 7 days and I haven't seen any grass and the eyesore is still there.  We have had plenty of rain so it has been watered a lot.  It seems you could buy some good topsoil, handful of grass seed and some lawn fertilizer and get the job done for a fraction of the price, probably with better results.  Once I see some growth I will add an update to this review.
1,UPDATE: Check the ratio of one star to five star reviews.  At the time of this update the split is 50/50.  So if you're willing to risk $800 and a huge head ache on a 50/50 chance this machine will quickly break down you are risking a lot! (read my experience below). Continue to do your home work and find another, higher quality unit!!!		To make a month long story short, unit arrived via common carrier two weeks after it was ordered, uncrated and fueled up. Battery would not turn over engine nor would pull start. Ordered new batter, two weeks later it arrived. Wrong battery. Went to the big box (HD) to resolve, they sent a person out. Transmission is defective (2 fw gears, 2 reverse gears). Loaded the POS on his truck and signed for a full refund. Good riddance! A total lemon and complete waste of time. I love Amazon but would be very careful ordering this mower online. Craftsman anyone?
1,None of them grew
1,They really did not do well.  I have replanted with local berry plants.
1,The latch on the back is very flimsy and the squirrels figured out how to open it right away.  Tying it shut with nylon cord has worked temporarily, but they eventually chew right through.  The squirrels hang upside down on the front bar and help themselves.  Doesn't deter them all that much.  I've had this for a couple of years and it worked better at the beginning.  The latch is very flimsy now and barely closes.  Very disappointed with it overall.  Our squirrels are very determined and smart.  Not sure what type of feeder to try next.
1,Tried this product in two locations, both still had wasp nest close by, like a foot away from it. Will have to try something else
1,The build quality was between three and four stars and customer service was four stars.  An item was missing, but they were responsive and quickly sent out the missing part.  The hardware started rusting quickly and did not hold the metal panels together securely.  The real problem may not be with the product, but instead the concept.  I found that the bins filled pretty quickly (two person household), the composting was slow and the output hardly worth the effort.  Additionally, maggots accumulated in the compost and as they dropped out through the small holes, they attracted moles to the ground beneath the composter.  I have less problems with a compost pile and that was completely free.
1,As others have said, you spend more time trying to clear it.
1,Came right on time. I Got this to try out to see if it would do better than using peanut butter. I've had it out for 2 days now and not a single mouse. I got 4 traps set out  2 with peanut butter and 2 with this gel. I bet you can guess where the mice didn't go.... Not sure this works at all. I'm just going to stick with using my peanut butter since that seems to work.
1,According to most of the reviews of these posthole diggers, they are the best there is. The ad claims they are factory sharpened to make digging easy. Well, this is pretty far from the truth. The ones I received were pretty dull, the ends had about a 3mm rounded end, which didn't dig very well at all, so I sent them back. If they were as sharp as a shovel, they would probably work pretty good.
1,I do not see any other option in my choices. I ordered two of these shovels for a church. They are listed as being delivered on January 25 which is a Saturday. The building was closed and the delivery note says it was delivered with out a signature.	I can not believe that any delivery company would leave it on the sidewalk in NYC. I am not getting any response in the reported delivery section and do not see any other available option other than this review. Obviously I do not intend to pay for something that I never received.		EDIT 1-30-15		I should have came back here and updated this review but forgot. I do feel it is relevant to review delivery results.	why should this have came with a leave if no one is there instruction when it is being delivered to a chuch with no one there in the middle of a city with locked gates.		When i found a way to deal directly with a person--- Amazon immediately delivered a new set free of charge. So they get 5 stars for resolution.		As far as the pusher it is just the right width for quickly cleaning down a sidewalk. It is as good as any that i have seen on the market---but the metal is soft and bends easily if you hang a corner. The thing is they all do. I have seen some ancient NYC pushers that have metal that has some real temper to it and do not bend but no one can purchase these new. The handle on the top is very useful for flipping snow off the pusher and the bracing is very helpful as far as supporting the handle.		I give the pusher 5 stars against any I have used and 3 stars against being the best it could be. Yes I would buy it again.
1,My son says that he has a hair dryer that blows better.
1,The instructions couldn't get much easier, it looks great and rocks very easily.		Took about 4 hours to put together. The instructions are great, but there are a lot of pieces. Everything is in sections with a separate bag for each section. So first, build the base of the chair and use screw bag 1, next put the wood slats on use screw bag 2. Only needed a screwdriver and a socket wrench.		Overall made well, there are a couple of plastic parts (spacers), but everything else is either wood or metal. The paint is on well, I slipped with the screwdriver a couple times and didn't scratch the paint.		Instructions say to seal once or twice a year which is pretty standard for any wood.		Update after almost a year:	It's become very disappointing since I originally purchased less than a year ago. Had the first plank break today, no one over 185 pounds has ever sat on it. I have sealed and stained it twice since purchase.  No loctite on the screws has meant they keep coming loose also. The wood stains have very visibly stained the metal. At this point, I would pay about $30 for this low quality. Cannot recommend.
1,Very small, weak plant that died pretty fast.
1,I've tried many different types of powdered shock for our above ground and this is just another one that does not hit the mark.  It doesn't completely dissolve and what does dissolve, takes lots of time and shaking in another container of water!		Save yourself lots of hassles and purchase liquid shock locally!
1,I really enjoyed having a fire pit but unfortunately I will need to throw this one out and get a better quality one for next summer. It is one of those situations where we had already started using it and then the issues began, so we made due and know this firepit is not built to last. It comes totally unassembled, directions were fairly easy to follow and I had no issues assembling the frame. Now for the tiles- they simply sit in the frame, but nothing holds them in- yes, they can and do fall out.	The table converts from a table to a fire pit by just removing the frame that holds 4 large tiles from the center of the table- it is a bit heavy and since the tiles are not secured in the frame you need to be careful when removing so as not to have a tile pop out. One of my guest did not know this and picked up the top to help and a tile fell out and broke-  I would use caution if you have kids. see pic	Rust- Yuck! See pic- As you can see the metal basket that covers the fire rusted, there are spots on the table frame that have specs of rust as well. That just lets ya know that this is not a quality piece of equipment- this is meant to be outdoors and should be able to endure the elements. It showed signs of rust within  2 weeks. Invest your money in something else- I would not recommend purchasing this based on my experience and the poor quality and design of the table.
1,not a very good deal. Go buy seeds at the store in your town, much cheaper.
1,Very cheap netting, slight amount of tugging and it ripped.  The netting ripped in multiple places, allowing leaves to enter the pond.  Measurements are not true to the advertising.  The spikes are CHEAP plastic.  A few snapped when trying to insert them into soft Fall ground.  This product will not be usable for more than one season and the word "usable" for this season is a generous description. Will NOT purchase this product again.
1,A fully charged battery ran down after about ten minutes. I was able to cut one-foot-high grass growing around three saplings, about 30 square feet of grass.		Even worse than the feeble run time is that using the trimmer is very uncomfortable. First, the handle does not slide up or down the shaft, so you cannot adjust the distance between your left and right hands. It's true you can get a little adjustment by pivoting the handle, but not enough. Plus, the shaft doesn't extend long enough to be comfortable for a big person. I'm 6 foot tall, and I had to lean forward to cut. After ten minutes my back and arms were ready to quit. Even worse, there is no trigger lock  -- the instructions say "To switch the tool on, squeeze the trigger lever. To switch the tool off, release the trigger lever." After ten minutes of holding down the very-unergonomic trigger, my left hand was cramping badly. Yow!		Bottom line is that my body can't take more than about ten minutes using this tool, which is about the time there's a noticeable drop off in power. A perfect match! I'm returning this badly designed junk toot suite.
1,I ordered these to go with the replacement spindles.  When I installed them they were too long and the bolts that hold the blades onto the spindles are hit by these bolts.  The factory bolts are 20 mm which is just about 3/4 inch and these bolts are about an inch.  Obviously not the same as John Deer OEM.  I had to go to the ACE hardware store and purchase 5/16" X 3/4 inch self tapping bolts for $1.20 each.  So now I have 12 useless bolts that I paid a buck a piece for along with the dozen bolts at $1.20 I had to go to hardware store to get.  Really wish the seller read the OEM parts list before listing these as JOHN DEERE bolts.
1,Not what I expected, very cheap looking.  I was going to retun but my husband decided to keep it
1,Had to retun the product items was missing, the pump assembly was not shipped with the package, bottom tray was damaged in shipping.  Made very flimsy. Not a quality item even for the good price. Took my money back, will explore other options.
1,So once again, dummy me bought the Snap Pack Fertilizer.  I only bought this unit because of the ease of not having to open a huge bag and use the conventional spreader.	This is the 2nd to 3rd year that I have used this unit, and each and every time I buy a Snap Pack, the contents never work, especially the weed and feed.  I have more weeds then before even though I follow the directions exactly.	One year, I had used the Snap Pack, and wondered as to why it went so quick but yet, you could hear that there was something inside the bag.  I opened it, and found mulch, sticks and twigs in the bag.	Not buying this any more.........waste of money
1,Horrible cheap junk. Paper thin. Zippers are garbage. Look elsewhere.
1,They don't perform as well as I hoped. They tend to make the filter cartridge float  out of hole and collected junk tend to float off the sock when pool pump is off.
1,The cavities are small and it's very flimsy. The last set I ordered I could reuse 2-3 times. These are just use and throw away. So I am not happy with the item.
1,Not as ad sates very thin string Cheap Cheap. Verified Purchase
1,These flame up more than the solid grill mats,and they warn you to keep away from flames?I have put these on top of my other grill mats. Well	made burgers and left for a minute and well that did in the mat it got to hot and the wire inside melted I guess,so in the rubbish can!!
1,Very few seeds germinated and the ones that did are puny. Don't waste your money on this product. I am disappointed.
1,There are particles and lumps in the solution that clogs up the sprayer. I have to stop during spraying, take the tip off the sprayer wand and wash the strainer in the tip of the wand to be able to continue spraying.  The solution of this concentrate does not seem to be up to strength.  Grass that I use it on takes a long time to die if they die at all. I sprayed the grass twice and some areas of the grass is still green. I followed the instructions on the Roundup container for the right mixture.
1,this thing is a joke really--  filled it up secured it-  in a month it popped---  i live in southern california so not that extreme
1,This items doesn't look too bad out of the package with its metal parts and shielded cable. I tested it and the blocking diode worked so no reverse charging at night.  As others have described the alligators clips are small and of poor quality. The output voltage in bright sunlight was a little disappointing in the 6.5V range compared for example to an American Hunter Solar Charger for their feeder/timer which I also have -  but the camera application that I was planning on using this for doesn't draw much so I figured 6.5V would be enough to replace a 1 amp hours draw each night. Will never know since after only a week in the field this panel is putting out ZERO voltage.
1,Bought 2, both stopped working. The gfi breaker doesn't reset. Don't waste your time with this product. Came on time, nice delivery, but product sucks
1,Hm-Hm!
1,Not what we expected
1,Can not recommend this item.  Compared to other weather stations I have it uses batteries 3 x as fast.  Does not update temps good even tho the sensor is less than 12 ft away. Same brand at Walmart, and was considerably less than the posted price here of over $25.
1,Like the conecpt, but the mats are to small.  Also when grilling the excess grease comes of the side and will start a fire and burn the mats.  Ok for cooking some items, but not all!
1,had/have a Japanese Beetle issue on my grapes....after using this....I have the same issue....it didn't work...at all.
1,Not that great. Hard to understand how to use & setup.
1,My rats are not suicidal enough for this trap to work. They eat the cheese completely and the trap doesn't snap. My old style el cheapo trap has caught two rats. The Tomcat has caught zero rats.
1,Ok why 1 star? Well besides them being made from metal, they are SUPER FLIMSY!! I got these to hang plants from. When I put the plants on them, they would bend very easily. I would not recommend purchase them.
1,All used up, and i think we have more mice now then when we first applied it.
1,Just like all the other ant baits I have tried the ants completely ignore it and walk right past. Waste of money.
1,The spray pattern was 20" wide.  This is too wide to water a garden row, flower, flower pot...  I really cannot think of practical use for this spray pattern.  If you read other reviews, you see talk of replacing the head (mine was crimped on).
1,Did not live out of the box.  :|
1,I wrote on mine with permanent marker and by the time my seedlings were ready to transplant the words were gone. When I tried putting them in the ground, they just blow over.
1,Unfortunatly, the gophers came back a few weeks later. I now have 4 devices working in a small area and am hoping that will fix my problem.
1,I had this for 3 weeks and it was actually on turned on only a half dozen times and stopped working.
1,It doesn't attract a single ant.  The ONLY way we've found to get this product to work is to cut the bait from it's plastic pouch and mix it with sugar.  Then the ants flood it and disappear within a day.  But if you want something you put down in the corner of your home or office and forget about, don't bother.  This thing doesn't work at all.  Even pulling up old bait stations after a year shows the bait untouched.
1,Got a good deal on it, so it's difficult to complain a lot. But this thing will not cut much more than a finger-sized branch and the chain keeps coming loose. Would not recommend, even at the sale price.
1,The trap is not easy to trigger.  I set it very loose--with the release pin on the very edge of the trigger plate and the moles go right through it without it going off.
1,Sent back, doesn't work
1,Stopped working after 2 days. Ended up returning it to Amazon for a refund.
1,This is a terrific tool. Sadly after one season of use the motor burns out. The B&D store replaced it twice under warranty & said that was it. So this year when I used it the 1st time, you guessed it, the motor started to burn. Dn't think I'll replace it & will make do with a weed wacker, not nearly so versatile.
1,CA gophers don't give a crap about this noise....they are still digging up the yard.
1,Not sturdy at all. These were also incredibly hard to screw together. Some pieces didn't even screw all the way together. It's wobbly and not sturdy at all. I also broke the plastic piece the first time I tried putting it in the soil. Cheaply made.
1,absolute a piece of garbage	I brought it just for the impact sprinkler, aware that the cheaply made spikes breaks  easily..  But I discover that the impact sprinklers are equally  flaw,  This is the first of dozens of sprikler  I've own that can't hold a set sweep arc.  With each impluse, the sprinkler would move a notch making the sweep wider and wider.  In a properly designed unit,  the limit rings are stiff and snug  so it can't be budged  each time the reversal detent hits it.  IN this piece of junk, the two undersized plastic rings flexes allowing the ring to rotate a bit with each impact.  Bear in mind that my cty water pressure is on the low side so it is not failing due to high pressure.  This product execution is about as bad as it gets.  Amazon should	have this piece of junk delisted asap.
1,Worst customer service ever.  The can comes equipped with lots of confusing and annoying "safety" features and little or no instructions.  When you ask customer service a question they bite your head off.  Very rude.  Buy a different product and you will be happier.
1,I bought 3.  The one used most often is falling apart and it hasn't even been 3 months.  If you do buy it, keep it outdoors so that the wind can carry away the fibers from the mat as it breaks down.
1,4/23/17 -Not what i was expecting. It feels like a cheap costume fabric.. its also very "loud" when it flys. Sounds like Christmas wrapping paper. Will update after a week or two to see how it will hold up.		6/21/17 update -- 2 months and its toast... see pics. Do not buy. You can clearly see where the white stripes have shredded. Also the blue has faded really bad. Also bought a different brand Texas flag that had the exact amount of pole time and it still looks brand new.
1,Not exactly right no thank you very much
1,not very functional
1,so far none have come up
1,Premium Price for a snow shovel that bent within the first snowfall. This should be made much better for the price paid.
1,Didn't work.
1,I received bulbs that were too dried out and had a mold or fungus on the bulbs. I planted them anyway but they never emerged from the soil. They decayed rather quickly. I won't be ordering these bulbs again. I was so disappointed that they did not bloom. I love these flowers and see them bloom in many yards in Tulsa Oklahoma. They are beautiful flowers....when they bloom!
1,This it not the way for sure I got one of theses back in 05! If u have nothing but time Ya it can catch them. But here's the crappy part u must catch them a few at a time! Check the trap every 5mins and if u have a few in there pull the trap out and remove the few that's in there and go put the trap back in the tank and u do this every 5min till you get sick of catching worms! Or u get rid of the tank, or just give up! I've work at it for about a week caught 100's of worms. But who wants to stay up all night long, taken the trap out every 5 mins, to wash out 4-5 worms at a time?? If u don't remove the worms as soon as they snake there way in.! There just going to snake right back out of there the same way they got in! Trust me! If u leave it over night?? Your going to wake up to a trap with nothing in it!!! Also use sinking tiny pellet fish food it's better. And place some in the tube of the trap not just in the bait hold. Trust me this trap is not the way to go. Just make your own trap .
1,Not much different than using my	Steel Paint Scraper	 After a good brushing...		Probably too wide for use on Weber 22 grill w/ flip sides (pictured)	Especially if you have the GBS (changeable parts) grate (pictured)		You can use it Very well (angling everything)		But I would stick to brushing & a flat scraper...
1,Bought this and never used it as stones too big. May take hammer and make them smaller.
1,easy to set but does not trip when animals eat bait. Takes too much pressure to trip. I have an older one without the easy set that catches animals a lot quicker and they cant get out. The new one has to close all the way to lock and large animals that are quick can push it open and get out when it does trip. Old ones without easy set are better.
1,Pump shorted out at one year old
1,Awful construction,  A small piece of tin inside of the umbrella sleeve of the stand, is how the bolt attaches umbrella coller to the sub base.	 Attempting a simple adjustment of the umbrella for shade while attached to the sub base cause it to snap and break loose from the bolt in the sub-base.	 Behind cheaply constructed !!!
1,This one was Junk! One bearing is too tight and would need a tornado to spin it. The light does not work. Bits and Pieces refunded the purchase price. Recommend the seller but the one I got was junk.
1,Two of them arrived dead
1,Good reviews - not sure why. I opened it, tried for 5 min and returned it immediately. It was so weak, 1 line that took too long to wack smallest grass even and the battery I don't think lasts long. Forget about it being an edger. On top of it it somehow started to turn off and on by itself why using it. Almost like dying. My old grasshog one with cord is the best.
1,It's a beautiful fire pit that we were purchasing it as a gift for our daughter's family.  Unfortunately, it arrived in terrible condition.  The box had been dropped at some point and the fire pit was damaged beyond repair.  Tiles were off and loose in the box.  The flat top of the frame was severely damaged.  Most of the Styrofoam packing material was shattered.		Once reported to Amazon they immediately arranged for it to be picked up by UPS who also provided the return label and receipt.  This happened 2 work days after we contacted Amazon through their web site.  The cost was credited to my credit card account the same day the return was picked up.  I give Amazon 5 stars for their handling of this issue.		Suggest that potential purchasers of items like this consider local stores before taking a chance on successful shipping.
1,not happy
1,Not even close to fitting. Ironically looks just like the old worn one I want to replace. Right part technically....so I got what I paid for...just big loose and sloppy.
1,Don't waste your money.  Did not root my plants and they died.
1,I went to Home Depot and found similar product, and 5 pounds of it, for $10.70 .  I tried to cancel this product under 24 hours from purchase and they refused!! Do not but this if you have a Home Depot near You!!  You are getting ripped off.
1,Save your money.  This thing has no power, is almost impossible to turn on and off, and is so short you have to be in the pool to sweep.  I returned it as fast as I could.
1,I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby. The birds don't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet.
1,Kind of flimsy. It has a plastic hook that I'm sure isn't going to last very long, and the entire thing is rather this plastic including the clear part. It is even thinner that the red part! Didn't want to bother with sending it back
1,Recommended this hose to 5 of my friends after I bought one, it is light weight but after only a few uses they leak at at the connection, all of my friends have had the same problem	and we can't figure out how to fix it, it's not worth the money
1,I personally hated this product.  Two stars because I may have done something wrong.  Put it on the grill and the edges started burning. The grill was a pool cheap grill and did not have a huge BTU rate so I assume it was the mat.  Took it off, threw it away and cooked my burgers on the grill.
1,I have two firepits, this one and one from Target which was gift from my children.  This pit is easy to use, only problem is you need two people to move it as one has to carry the tank while someone else carries the firepit.  It throws out a lot of heat, and has a great flame.  The fancy stone fire pit that my children purchased for me, while very pretty, does does not throw out nearly as much heat and the flame is no where near the size of this pit.  Its a great buy, which i could find something with many BTU's that was a little prettier.		UPDATE 10/11/15:  The weather is just now turning cooler here in NYC.  Went out last night could not wait to turn on my firepit and guess what???  Nothing,  I could not get a flame to go up higher than an inch.  I changed propane tanks, turn the gas on slow blah blah blah. Nothing worked had to resort to the good old fashion fire, very disappointed.  I loved this little fire pit and now it's just a hunk of metal sitting in my garage. Very disappointed.
1,I would've put 5 stars, but the bucket cracked within 6 months of use so it no longer can hold water. There goes that $$!
1,Basically, it's a thin tarp. Even the tarps available at the local "cheap Chinese tool" store are thicker than this. We'll see how it stands up.
1,The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.		This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all.
1,Weak tines..... spring action is great. Already have similar rake from many years past. The tines are sturdier and is an excellent thatch rake. This would suffice as a leaf rake. It is over priced. Found the same rake at the hardware s tore for $10 less.
1,This looks nice, but is not stable enough.  The spike is three seperate metal pieces that fit together. But they fit together loosely, so the whole thing is unstable and wobbly. The rain catch does not sit flat, and is pushed a bit to the side by the metal curly.  I have tried to bend to get it straight, but it just will not get level.
1,Nice build but as it really doesn't rock you can save $20 and choose the same chair without the rocker.	Maybe it rocks enough when you get up to spill a drink off the arm rest.
1,Self watering is not accurate. You have to drain excess water by tipping the tray!!! Hello? Otherwise your plants will be water logged.
1,Flower House products are junk.  Not worth the $.  Easy to put together but did not last a whole season.  I used tie downs and stakes but it still ripped and the fiberglass poles broke.  Flower House customer service is  non existent.  I have e-mailed them over and over again and have never received the courtesy of a response.  You can't buy replacement poles and the warranty is useless since they never respond.  Don't waste your $.
1,It's okay. But not really "good" and definitely not great! The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is 2 small holes in the vacuum head. I figured these would reduce the suction below the head because it would have these 2 holes to pull water through. So I filled them.		The second thing I noticed was how high this thing is. There's a lot of space between the bottom of the head and the surface of the pool. Some may think that's a great thing for getting the bigger leaves up. If you are looking for something to clean leaves, YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE WRONG TOOL! If you are cleaning leaves get a leaf tool. They go by many names: Leaf Eater, LeafMaster, LeafBagger,etc. The more space between the bottom of the head and the surface of the pool, the less suction there is for removing what this tool is meant for: DIRT! It will do the job but it takes more time. I suppose that's fine if you have no job and all the time in the world, but that's not me!		So, I had to modify the wheel assembly a little bit to give me less space under there. I'd hate to know what it would have been like without modifications because the suction is pretty bad where it was amazing with the last head I had which was just worn out.		The third thing I noticed wasn't until I had it in the water. This thing is LIGHT! That's not a good thing. With it being so light and with so little suction, there wasn't much keeping this thing on the bottom of the pool. If I moved a little too fast I'd find it popping a wheelie. So, back to those 2 little holes in the head that I had to fill. Looks like they have another version of this tool with 2 more weights on it. Those holes are for the screws that hold 2 more weights on. It needs that weight.		I'm the kind of guy who doesn't mind modifying his tools a little bit to make them more effective. But when they still aren't very effective after modifications...look elsewhere.
1,Does an excellent job of cleaning my pool but cleaning out the filter baskets is difficult.		Also, yanking on the power cord to "bring it up" seems like it may lead to problems later on if that cord ever splits.		Finally, is this power supply weather resistant or not? The included documentation is awful.		UPDATE - After 3 months, it turns out I was right. removing the unit from the pool ultimately led to the power cord separating. Time to find out how good their customer service is.		UPDATE #2 - Emails to the company went unanswered so I had to call them. They directed me to a company in KS that would service my warranty. Long story short, I had to call the guys in KS, buy a box to ship it in, coordinate with them for the shipping and details, wait 2-3 weeks for the repair. Not exactly meeting my expectations for warranty repair on an $800 product.		Reducing from 3 stars to 2 based on the warranty fiasco.
1,Dispite contacting Weber customer service, reading the in store specification guide, reading the actual Owner's Manual out of the box, all telling you that this grill accepts the 16.4 oz tank, IT DOES NOT.  Weber said it must be a "manufacturer defect".  Then they sent email stating 2008 models or newer would take tank.  Then received another email saying 2009 models or later.  Apparently no one at Weber knows anything.  Returned the grill.  Ending up trying to attach 16.4 oz tank on three other Q-100's and of course, it would not fit on any of them.  BIG WASTE OF TIME.  DOES NOT TAKE 16.4 OZ TANK.
1,I have given up because it sounds like getting the old one off is too hard.  It probably involves cutting the old attachment.  So this sits in my workshop and I use the grill with just 2 flaps.
1,I bought this this 3 months ago, it hasn't ripped or faded yet, however the cover itself is very thin and I foresee it lasting only a year. Make sure you mail in the paperwork to extend the one year warranty to two, I did.
1,I purchased two sets of these on June 22, 2014 and I paid $60 for the two sets.  Today is October 14, 2014.  I filled the bags with sand and placed them around the legs of my canopy.  I have included photos of what they look like today, because you probably wouldn't believe me.  If you touch them they disintegrate in your hand.  You can see what will happen, so you decide
1,This did absolutely nothing to deter the rabbits invading my landscape. I followed the directions to a T and they just waltzed right over it eating what they wanted.
1,ItT doesn't exist. Company not filling orders.
1,The hummers out here had no interest, zone 10
1,This axe was horrible. My son went to use it and on the fifth hit to a tree we need to fell in our back yard the extra strong hardwood handle broke. This was a real shame because we really needed a good axe, but this was not the one.
1,Well ... I got a sprig. I could have paid the same amount at Walmart and gotten more. It arrived frozen - despite the no penguins stickers all over it. It is sitting in warm water - I am hoping some of the root (btw - I barely have that ...) has not been too badly damaged.	Very disappointed.		FYI: I started rooting it again in warm water and it started sprouting.	- it is still tiny	- my pinky finger is bigger than this shoot.	FYI: the frost burn died back and I have a new shoot coming. Still rooting in water.
1,Can't say for certain that the fertilizer is superior to other major brand, but I think not. Followed the instructions and IMO, the weed control is completely ineffective. Returned to the local supplier.
1,Looks nice. Must be level and full, fuse blew after first 2 minutes. Pump cannot be turned to 100 psi it just stops. After 50 psi pump shuts off. No slopes, suction hose will not spray on slopes. Tank must be half full all time. Pump is not big enough to keep enough pressure in the tank. Makes a good ornament for your tractor as long as you don't have to treat anything.
1,Arrived with no legs!
1,These are VERY small.  They are also not very thick. I ended up get the 2x2 tiles at an autoparts store to use a floor mats when working on my car.  These just were not the right item.
1,Seeds never took
1,Purchased product September 29, 2016.  May 7, 2017, come home to find the side that is NOT connected to my backyard sprinklers but is connected to the hose, has some how sheared off and my backyard was flooded.  Product last 8 months.
1,It was sick when I got it from the cold.
1,Crap pump. Doesn't self prime, and definitely doesn't push 530 GPH. i got a ~200 gph fountain pump from lowes to replace it that pushes more water and self-primes every time. Stayed submerged for hydroponics and wouldn't start moving water until taken out to air and put back submerged. I lost my crop of pepper and tomato plants to this thing.
1,son's cat is small and we had to pass
1,I got a La Crosse Technology weather clock as a gift a year ago, and it worked well for a while, until it stopped registering the outside temperature at about 11 months.  I tried replacing batteries several time to no avail, and finally purchased the sensor to see if that would get the clock working again.  Unfortunately, it did not.  The clock still works fine, just the outside temperature feature doesn't, so I'll continue to use the clock, and forget about the temperature thing.  Disappointing, but if you run an internet investigation on the clock, you'll find that this is a regular problem with La Crosse Technology wireless temperature products.
1,THE STEEL QUALITY WAS VERY WEAK AND THE FORK BENT EASILY.  WHILE STEAKS DO NOT FIGHT BACK AND I GENERALLY TRY TO BUY MEAT THAT CAN BE PIERCED, CORN ON THE COB WAS MORE DIFFICULT. RIBS AND CHICKEN WITH BONES ARE HIT OR MISS.  IT'S FRUSTRATING WHEN IT HAPPENS, BUT NOT THE END OF THE COOK OUT.  YOU'LL NEED THE 5 SECOND RULE.
1,On/off switch broke relatively soon, had to rebuild which was a hassle. Telescoping sleeves started falling apart also. Cutting head works decent.  Would not recommend this item unless you're handy and don't mind rebuilding things.
1,This does not fit the 30 inch master built smoker.  Would not fit mine.
1,None of them sprouted. Waste of money.
1,Seed spilled out too fast. Returned
1,not what I expected. Way too firm, falls off conectors. junk
1,I have been maintaining small koi ponds for over 10 years. I recently made a larger 1000 gallon pond for two12 inch koi and four 4 inch chubunkin.	My 300 gallon pond for the same fish was always clean with a UV clarifier and various plants. I thought I would use this product till I got the water plants established.	It did nothing. Very dissapointed.
1,Tabs are too large for slots. Impossible to fit top to bottom. I have the smaller version and like it. Hope the company gets the issue fixed before too many other buyers go through the hassle of returning this monster box.
1,This surface cleaner is the real deal, it cut my cleaning time in half  it really got the job done removing dirt and film from the cement, the only thing you should do is get an extension wand, it will save your back from bending over I would give it six stars  if possible, I researched this product and have read many reviews, had to choice between two final cleaners and believe me this one should of been rated # 1 in  my opinion not experiencing the other choice, buy it  you won't be sorry, My wife even helped with the driveway seeing what a good job it was doing  the surface cleaner does all the work you have to just guide it .. no water or mess on your shoes or pants, it contains all the mess with in the cleaner...	 the cons was that my surface cleaner came delivered from this seller without a cover box.. it made it possible for every and anyone to see what the item was and made it a target for thief.. The seller should of put it in an unmarked box making it unknown to any unfriendly eyes... not happy about that at all  ( pay attention seller)
1,This is a terrible cover. Buy the newer model covers that Amazon carries. Much better quality. My cover lasted one winter before starting to fall apart. This model does NOT handle water or sun well.
1,Nothing sprouted. i tried two control groups. none grew
1,Terrible
1,Not what was advertised
1,I connected the hose to the faucet, unrolled it (good non-kink action) and gave a slight tug. The ring that connects the hose to the faucet came unattached from the hose.  I had bought the hose assuming that anything sold at Costco is of good quality, and was disappointed when I saw the ratings in the reviews.  I am disappointed in Costco that they are providing a product that does not get primarily 5 and 4 stars in its ratings.
1,It's junk. The thermometer reads about 9 degrees F too low.		I'm sending it back.		The manufacturer, Chaney Instrumentn wase careless to let this escape out the front door, and the seller should be ashamed to sell carp that doesn't work and inconveniences the victim, I mean customer.
1,the seeds germinated then died
1,Trashed it.
1,after one week one  rivet broke,not made very good,  I've had trouble with the prongs, which hold the bottom tray on, because they come out and the food spills all over. not so good and there is no lead. UPDATE: SPRING RESISTANCE STARTS TO GIVE AWAY LEAVING A FISH HOOK FOR YOUR CHICKENS, ONE OF OURS HOOKED HER BEAK. THIS IS NOT A HARRIS FEEDER IT'S FROM CHINA BUYER BEWARE THIS WILL HURT YOUR CHICKENS!
1,I was excited to receive these bulbs. There flowers never grew. I am very disappointed. I followed the instruction on the package, but they did not work. Can I get refund, or replacement? Thank you.
1,At first, I was happy with this product. But after installing this around my front yard and seeing it set after a month of being in place, its pretty much ugly because it warps. If you are doing any hard landscaping, you are better off using less subtle curves and going with the much thicker border products available.  I just cannot recommend this because it is way too thin and doesn't hold its shape well to be attractive..
1,balsa wood.  not functional as a bird house.  craft-level quality.  not what i expected.
1,Owner asked for photos. Will not buy from again.
1,Don't understand why so many good reviews. I had one last year, tried at drive way, and returned right away. The blade is plastic. I guess it is probably ok on the wood deck, but absulutely not on my drive way.
1,I try not to leave a bad review but these are horrible.
1,I have trusted the Black and Decker brand for several year to be reliable and quality built.  This watering wand looked good and promised to deliver great service.  However, using it for the first time the flexible head came apart rendering the whole item unusable. I sent it back to Amazon and they promptly replaced it. It is hoped this second one is much much better.
1,Never killed a single mouse.
1,I make compost tea I thought I could uses the siphon it this thing isn't worth nothing I just ended up putting it away and eventually I'll just throw it in the garbage don't bother wasting your money
1,Easy to install but no problems for racoons to go around it. No deterrent for them at al.
1,The plant looks healthy, but it has never bloomed.  I have it in aneast & west window, but that doesn't seem to help.  The vine itself is long & I give it a boost with drops to help it bloom.
1,I hope you can tell by the title of my review exactly how I feel about this piece of junk, and I hope you'll heed my warning and not waste your money. Being a BBQ light, this is obviously meant for outdoor use, correct? The first thing that happened was the clear plastic lens on the light fogged over, then cracked and fell off the light. Then I noticed the gooseneck arm beginning to rust all along its length. I was pretty disgusted by this thing at this point, but at least it still worked. Then one day I came outside to find the LED light itself lying on the patio, and just two wires sticking out of the head of the fixture. I guess the cheap plastic lens that fell out previously had been holding it in, and the this time the light itself fell out and ripped itself off its wires. Did I mention worthless piece of junk?? Did I also mention complete waste of money?? Please save yours and buy something other than this!!!
1,Received and is in good working order very easy to put together beautiful cover antique bronze seems very reliable I hope you enjoy full long time I will read the reviews before I bought it and so far so good....		Update... part of the seed broke off does not appear to be very durable did request a replacement but very disappointed and I hope I don't have to return it all together because it is a nice looking set
1,Large seams running the length of the piece on both sides are disappointing, also detail is very muttled. I understand the $$ were low but would not of purchased it if I felt and saw it 1st.
1,does not least but 30 minutes
1,This was quite tough to set up and I'm pretty sure it is inaccurate.  Gives you wind, temp, barometer, and rainfall.  The sensors all use batteries, so make sure you put them where you will be able to change the batteries every few months.  Of course, they can't be too far from the base unit or it won't transmit a signal.  I found that the range (through one exterior wall) was about 100 feet reliably.  You could probably double that, but you will have some transmission problems.  We had a light drizzle and after two hours it measured zero rainfall.  Then it was quite dry the next day and it said we had 2 inches of rain!  The wind sensor seems to work OK in a stiff breeze, but cannot do much if the wind is below 10 knots.		The base units are unnecessarily complex.  I'm still not sure why there are two pieces.  One that looks like a camera, isn't a camera.  Or at least I can't get it to work as a camera.		Who knows. It's not like you can read the instructions or go online for help.  This is really something you have to figure out yourself.		Finally, the app has a few bugs.  Stupid stuff.  Like it gets the day of the week wrong, even when the date and time are correct.		I would just recommend relying on a local weather service for this information.
1,Too long a shaft to fit the General Pump pressure Water Broom-16". I got the information for ordering from the broom manufacturer but it does no fit in male or female. Thank you.
1,I've had luck with some of the bargain prices on Amazon so I took a chance on this pottery bench - Sorry to say this one didn't work out for me		First problem was I was missing parts - This company has no phone contact option so it is email and wait - After 4 days without a response I figured I was on my own		Second the product description states paint ready for "do-it-yoruself" finishing - My bench came with a sprayed on finish that covered some parts but not others (one side of the wood with spray and one side without) - That means for an even finish I'd have to prime the whole bench		Third the slats are 1/2 inch thick and span a 48 inch width without a center support - The bench would never support a one gallon pot let alone a bag of potting soil - The wood quality is close to "balsa" -  If you had it in an open area a strong wind could blow it over .....it would never survive a galloping 4 year		I could see someone using it for light duty on a covered patio but even then you;'d be luck to get a few seasons of use - I returned mine
1,So, it was my fault that I ordered this product without necessary understanding of the term "systemic" fungicide. Nevertheless, I would expect clearer warning label/product descriptions about the potentially harmful effect, or at least say how log the toxin lasts when used on veggies and fruit trees. If you are as new to the term "systemic" as I am, here is an informative reading:  http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/brent-preston/pesticides-systemics_b_7252650.html
1,Mine came scratched and dented :( the fan also would not work when we plugged it in. We were so excited to get it and then Beth sad it did not come in good condition.
1,not sure if this was just mine, but the temp readings were about 15 degrees higher than actual.
1,It's re-labeled Agverra SoilNoc CT Myco. Expensive for what it is.
1,I went for this because of price. My mistake, it kinks and the kinks turn into squeezed shut areas that have to be worked back to open flo. Never will buy again.
1,Worthless for our above ground intex pool.
1,General Hydroponics was bought by "Scotts Miracle Grow" and holds an extreme anti-cannabis stance.  If you legally cultivate stop buying these products and order from Advanced Nutrients.  If you still want to support GH, the product I ordered from this store works for what it is intended...
1,Both packages had rotted potatoes thus no plants grew, also they were not washed
1,Put it on the appropriate connection, turned on the pump and the pressure gauge exploded.
1,I was so excited to receive this statue which is more like a figurine due to it's size.  It's very small and appears very cheaply made.  The material is a blue grey plastic-y material and overall appears very "cheap!"  I was disappointed to say the very least upon receipt of this item as I had purchased this and the little boy as a retirement gift for someone and I would've been very embarrassed to present this at the party.  I would not recommend this at all.  The concept is great but that's where it ends.  The product... not anywhere near as great as the concept!!  :(
1,One of the blades snapped in half after a couple months of use. Probably not solid metal.
1,This is the second control box ive had burn up in 3-1/3 years . I remove them in winter and and store them inside . The cells are supposed to be disposable , not the controller. Both purchased through Amazon, thats over $1000.00 for two complete systems for about 14 months of actual use  here in Virginia.	I used the Hayward help line # 908 355 7995 that Amazon gave me. After 45 minutes of waiting i went the the store and left the phone off the hook , came back about an hour and a half later and yes ,the recording was still running.	Since pool is now green I tried E mail and was  told two days later to take it somewhere in North Carolina to get it looked at.		I did love the salt pool when it worked but will be going  back to the old chemical way. If you still want a salt generator I suggest you buy one locally,  that way somebody may actually  care if your pool water is green. ( second one bought 7-23-16,,,broke 7-8-17 )	I would definitely  use a different manufacturer. Dont know much about them but they almost have to have a better service life than hayward.
1,UGUGGGG.... Didn't see that you need to order battery and charger separately, won't work without that ...  and it's about $69 extra, each battery.  Like buying a car, and needing to purchase the engine, separately ...  When I can aford to buy the batteries and charger for the 2 that I ordered, I will let you know how it works blowing leaves ...
1,Seller wait it could take up to 9 months to germinate. Yeah right!	None of the seeds sprouted indoors.
1,I have a Meyer Lemon Tree (in a large pot) that's precious to me.  It's a young tree, and as the weather began to get cold it showed signs of stress including yellowing of leaves and some leaf fall.  I looked long and hard for the right fertilizer for a citrus tree, and chose Dr. Earth.  The tree's response was nothing short of amazing, including production of new growth along the lower portion of the trunk.  However, I began to see bugs moving in the top layer of the soil, easily seen, and immediately after I noted the bugs, leaves began falling off the tree once more.  I treated soil and leaves and eventually conquered bugs.  An entire year passed before I again added this product to the soil, and again within a few days I began to see movement in the top layer and soon saw the bugs.  I am again treating the poor tree with an agent to kill the bugs, many of which have grown wings and flew off to infect other plantings.  Sigh.... this was NOT the desired effect!
1,OK, so I planted an entire hillside with Gazania - dumb right? WHO KNEW that was a rabbitt's favorite food?  I read about this product along with the reviews and was hopeful.  Well, it doesnt cover near as much square footage as they say and the bunnies only stayed away for about 3 days.  I know it needs to be re-applied, but I cannot afford to re-apply so often.  It seemed like after the first watering, this stuff was history and the little pesty Bunnies were back in force. Hopefully it works better for you if you try it.
1,Bought two La Crosse ws-9004u rain gauges,one works one does not. Heck, one out of two aint bad!!! Cheap price cheap product.
1,This trap has been running for several days and has only caught gnats and a moth. It is loud and very cheaply made. I would not recomend this product to anyone. The more expensive ones mays work better but this is useless.
1,The image and pricing indicate you receive all 4 misters.  You only receive 1 and have no choice for the color.
1,Only use in back yard to water flowers 2 months old went out this morning turn it on it busted.  junk junk junk junk junk do not order.
1,I just received this today. It's made of quality heavy material which is good. This means it will hopefully last out in the weather. The problems are:	1. Unless you spray W40 or some other silicone on the screw-on pieces you will have a difficult time attaching them.	2. There is no way to twist the pieces to get them to line up. When the hook piece is in the position you want it in, the end piece that goes into the bracket doesn't line up. Maybe a really strong person can twist the pieces to be tight and still be in alignment but I couldn't do it. I don't want to use a tool to do it because I might scratch the pieces.	I bought this to hang my bird feeder on and keep the squirrels off. If I can figure out how to tighten the pieces and get them in alignment then I'll be happy.
1,I highly doubt this is a real Weber product, although I do know Weber manufactured a cover a few years ago that was discontinued because consumers complained about them, so perhaps this company is getting rid of the extra's.  It didn't fit my Weber Genesis Gold grill, it was flimsy and wouldn't hold up very long outdoors.  Not recommended...
1,Just as described & look great. But doesn't scare birds much.
1,The hose connected to the vacuum head broke after 4 months.  It is more rigid than other hoses so the vacuum tends to get stuck a lot compared to softer hoses.
1,Bought this tubing for a new, bigger pond pump for my granddaughter's memorial pond. Not the same thickness as the previous tubing and slightly bigger in diameter than it says. It is very thin and when I tightened a clamp to hold it to the pump it started to leak. Checked the connection and found that the clamp had cut the tubing. So I tried it again but to clamp it tight enough to hold it on the pump cut the tubing again. I cut that piece off then noticed that there were several little pin holes in the next few inches of tubing. So, what I had to do was wrap some thin foam rubber around the end of the tubing, wrap tape around that then tighten the clamp. I do not know how it will handle the fall and winter seasons but I know come spring it will need to be replaced. I can not recommend this tubing for anyone with a pond. Too much work and monetary investment in putting in a pond to let this cheap tubing ruin everything. I wish I had the money to replace this now before the weather gets cold but I just do not, fingers crossed that I do not lose my fish this winter.
1,I puchased it for measuring pH only and it doesn't work. I tried it in urine, baking soda, clorex... Nothing really moves that needle, and it was fully switched to pH measurement.		Now I figure that I would love to find a pH meter that has a whole range of, say, 6.5 to 7.5 ---no less, no more---because that's the relevant range. I don't think the light meter works either, or it's just very insensitive.
1,Have had it just a couple of months and it broke today. It wasn't fully opened and the wind wasn't strong either. That leads me to believe that this was not well made at all. Money wasted.
1,it does not work on killing the crab grass. even regular vinegar will do a better job
1,Died within 2 months. Maybe this climate isn't the right home for it.
1,Ok
1,They haven't shown any signs of the growing at all and they have been planted long enough that they should be coming up by now.
1,I just don't see the results. I used this product as directed but I haven't seen any positive results. Not worth it if the product doesn't work as outlined.
1,This item received mixed reviews, but there were more good than bad, so I decided to take a chance.  Bad decision.  I have a 33' above ground pool.  I knew that this only came with 30' of hose, but I figured I would try it out, and if it worked I would buy the extra hose.  I received it today, put it together as the pictures showed (I hate instructions with pictures and almost no text), and got it working in the pool.  I stood there and watched as it puttered along, in a 20' circle, over, and over, and over again.  I tried adjusting the FlowKeeper Valve on all 3 settings, with the same results.  I had both of my water jets directed down to the pool floor, as directed, and it kept going in a 20' circle, over, and over, and over again.  It won't even deviate to clean any part of the inside of the circle, just the circumference.  With taxes I paid just over $157 for this vacuum to be able to automatically clean just under 63 linear feet.  That works out to be about $2.50/ft, over, and over, and over again.  You can take your chances if you like, but I wouldn't recommend it.		I added one star to my original review because I was able to return it for a refund with no problems.  After reading other reviews I got the impression that this was not returnable, but that is not the case.
1,Amazon mislabeled n-p-k values drastically.  Nearly half the strength of other bulb foods
1,I was Hoping that you couldn't see thru  it but you can, I Installed it on field fence but I think that it would work and last longer on chain link fence, don't buy the Frequently Bought Together cable ties, they are too thin and don't hold up		Update: Neighbors Dogs can see thru it and still bark, did not work as needed
1,worked 2 days, then stopped
1,One kind of seeds sprouted already and are growing fast. Hopefully the others will sprout soon.		Update- only one kind sprouted and it's an ivy plant! Very dissatisfied!!
1,I used half the amount recomended and it curled all my leaves. At the end of my harvest I couldn't tell any diffrence from the plants I used it on and the ones I didn't "Besides the curled leaves. I'll never use this again and I tossed the rest.
1,Very underpowered.  Only kills tiny bugs and just burns the wings off larger one leaving their carcass alive on the ground.  A waste of money and pretty inhumane to the bugs.  No, I'm not a bug lover but I want them dead, not just maimed and dying slowly.
1,I have had this weather station for about 2.5 years, maybe 3.  Worked pretty good...for awhile.  I like that it captured the data to the PC and that you could have your sensors so far apart.  I had the wind sensor on a 15' pole atop the roof, the rain meter is on a fence post in the front yard, the hygrometer was attached to a post on the front porch ~ 10' from the front door, but with a direct line to both the wind meter and the rain meter.  The console was in the house, maybe 15 yards from the front door.		Like I said, it worked pretty good for awhile.  I was getting data reliably not only to the console, but it was logging it to my network storage device.  Pretty cool setup.		But about a year into it the trouble started.  First to go was the wind meter.  Of course before I pony up whatever $$'s for the wind meter, I check the batteries and try resetting and so on.  It becomes like a freakin' episode of the Lucille Ball Show.  Take the batteries out, test them, replace them, but wait 10 minutes, then poke this hole with a paperclip, then put the batteries in this one first, that one second, and let the hygrometer get to know his little subset of fragile devices before the coup d-grace, putting the batteries into the display.  It's quite maddening.		After the wind meter went out, the rain meter went out.  I figured still cheaper than buying a new one, so I ordered a rain meter (from LaCrosse Direct).  Now I cannot get the display to talk to the hygrometer.  And now I don't know what to replace.  And LaCrosse customer support IS truly awful no doubt about that. And I don't want to hear how I better use fresh batteries.  I go through batteries like crazy, so I've got ample stock and I've got a decent tester (thanks to another Amazon compulsion) so I always, always test them.		I'm stuck.		The problem is I cannot find anything that comes close to providing all this stuff at this price point.  Some charge extra for the software to the PC, which seems ridiculous, but I really feel like this one is becoming a huge sinkhole.
1,only used a few times, the design is not smart, the blower outlet is not at the center of unit, when you turn the power on, it make you feel the blower unbalance, you are not just need to hold it upright, also need to maintain it towards front.		update on 9/28/2017	it only last one year, primer plastic tube broken, have to look for repair. do not buy it.
1,No matter how we set the trap nothing has been caught and it's not because there aren't enough moles-our yard is ruined by them this year.
1,Missing top piece (cover) but not worth the trouble of returning it.  The birds don't seem to mind however.  Otherwise it is a well made product.
1,This is a cheap, unattractive feeder, made entirely of plastic, even the "jar" that holds the nectar is cheap soft plastic.  I won't be using it.  I'll order another one, made of glass with a better overall look and higher quality.
1,We thought it would be cute to have in the pool; but the temperature is ALWAYS 10 degrees off.  oh well
1,I agree with James D's review. I have a Masterbuilt 20075315 I ordered and also ordered this stand to go with it. After assembling the smoker and then trying to attach the stand it was not working well. I did manage to get it attached but it was painful. The instructions are unclear and according to their instructions I should have had another nut to attach (the original and another which was not supplied) but the nut was not in the packet. The instructions don't tell you specifically remove the existing feet/bolts/nuts from the assembled smoker. Once I realized they sent longer (feet/screws) it made more sense but with spacing on the base, You could strip the threads on the new screws in this kit. They don't tell you to remove the old feet and screws and replace with the ones in the packet. Where you need to use the feet they supply for replacments, the instructions show how to mount the stand to the smoker (just a picture). The holes drilled out of the stand in order for you to re-insert the new feet (and nuts - missing from the hardware) are really tight and I'm guessing that's why James D. had an issue. I had to loosen the screws on the stand to adjust them. Masterbuilt shold just get rid of the 2 holes drilled for the back (maybe they did this for old/new gen smokers) and just slot them. That way you can adjust them.	Just poor instructions and missing parts. If you are handy you can get this to work but I'm dissappointed in the engineering of this stand.
1,It's OKbut compared to the other ones I have.not so good
1,They were easy to use and clean up was easy, however, they didn't infuse the smoke flavor I was hoping they would... Stick with the actual smoker!
1,The package had me expecting to have a great germination of these seeds.  I planted about half the seeds in peat pots so I could carefully watch them. Kept moist and out of direct sunlight. A lot of trouble for very little germinated plants.
1,DID NOT WORK
1,I'm a pretty experienced gardener and have been wanting to add some wisteria to my back yard to drape over an ugly shed. Although you do get a very large amount of seeds, not a single seed germinated. I tried contacting the seller and they only responded with a bunch of questions about how I planted them, as if I didn't know how to grow from seed. If there's special instructions to actually get these to grow, they should include it with the seeds. Otherwise, you can't blame the buyer for planting in typical fashion.
1,I have been gardening for years.	This item has no instructions it looks like an itty bitty bag of dirt
1,Out of the seeds listed, it appears I've only been able to germinate about 5 plants that will thrive. May not be the seeds problem but the soil or any number of things. This is my experience with them however.
1,Leaks badly. Seal ring poor quality.
1,after trying several of this style of water timer, i'm convinced that the overall design is flawed... not a single one worked (as in, you turn the dial to 10mins and it shuts off in 10mins... it just keeps running and running). a standard kitchen timer with a beep or bell as a reminder to turn off the water works better for us.
1,UPDATE - After a few years outside, despite regular cleaning, this feeder has developed rust on the inside floor (whereon the seed is deposited).  Rust is toxic to birds. Looks nice, works well, but we get lots of rain. Our squirrels chew everything, so plastic is not an option. Wood, maybe--provided there are openings for the rain issue.
1,A little cheap. Received with a broken cover which I had to glue on. Need 2 people to install and remove.
1,Useful for not much more than snipping a flower bud.  Blades are smaller than the pictures suggests.  I returned it.		Spare yourself the headache of accepting the invitation to review this seller's products.
1,Claims to be hardy and fast growing but it didn't do well at all.
1,Goes through gas like something else...low temperature is not enough to really work like the big ones. This is a waste of your money.
1,I replaced the carb, a few minutes later fuel was running out of the primer jet.  This typically means the float was stuck.		I installed a fuel shut off valve as a backup.  It's a $15 carb, my expectations were low.  I may pull it apart and use the OEM float, for now the fuel cut off when the engine isn't running keeps it from leaking.
1,This bloomed as regular Morning Glory. Did NOT bloom into the Butterfly Pea Flowers. DON'T BUY this. FAKE.
1,I was not happy with the quality of wood that arrived. It was not clean wood and it had a lot of knots in it. Assembly would not be simple.
1,nothing sprouted,
1,Nothing has com up that looks like grass.  I'm glad I didn't buy enough for the whole property.
1,Traps are longer and wider than others i have used so you have to dig out more to get it in a hole. also don't like the way the trap is set up. the springs get stuck a lot when you depress them making it a pain to set the rod. also, i think too much force is required to set off the trap. top it off, each time i have put them in the ground, they get buried. at least i know the gophers are still around. wouldn't recommend these to anyone. never had these problems with the silver traps.
1,Returning item.	Came used looking.	Rip cord came out too quickly.	Cheaply made and not recommended.
1,Junk
1,Seller was great but product was just ok. Fit pool perfectly but did not raise the temperature at all. Good for keeping debris out I guess but then you can't use the floaty with chlorine either, so...
1,I have one purchased elsewhere.  It cooks fine but is an absolute nightmare to clean, and the grate is razor sharp at the edge and difficult to remove.  After all that, you can never really get it clean - it's mostly metal (that is now rusting by the way after being stored with its custom cover), and it might as well be electric for the lack of flavor it adds to food.
1,junk, broke soon after i bought it
1,It does not work! Does not move or suck anything in. The pool now is all green... Amazon should not even sell this product. It is a big disappointment and they will not do a return without a 20% restocking fee for something that does not work and they charge a fee to restock and resell it to another customer?!? If it does not work why are you charging a fee to re-stock?
1,Edit/removal of two stars: Of course literally a couple of days after I write the positive review below, the price goes up by over $20. Unreal, and with that type of increase they have lost a customer who was about to be a frequent orderer and quite loyal! -12/3/17		About $12-$15 more than my local (read: not actually that local, one reason I have to resort to Amazon for this item instead) similar mixture of the same weight by volkkmann, but the goldfinches fly through it faster so it must be good stuff... though not great on the wallet, the convenience factor is strong here for a staple product of my yard. Normally takes a surprisingly quick amount of time to get here, too. Would recommend for finch feeders if unable to physically go in to support local feed places.		Nutshell: The best deal I have seen on any similar bulk item of this mixture of seed (nyjer + hulled sunflower bits) at this grain level (fit for mesh screen or thistle feeders) on Amazon.
1,total garbage. Used as directed. Powdery mildew is still all over the hydrangeas.  Buy something else if you're shopping for this item.
1,It worked great for 2 months but then the soaker hose started to develop large leaks in different sections and at the nozzle. Eventually over half the hose wasn't getting water and finally the nozzle broke off. Just low quality.
1,Plastic tipped BBQ tongs?  Are you kidding me?  What idiot thought of using plastic - even if it is a silicone - around a hot BBQ?		The rest of the set isn't better.  The fork is made of relatively thin metal.  The stem is formed into a curve to provide the appearance of thickness and provide structural strength.  The handle of the spatula is the same.  Both would probably easily bend if they were left flat.  On top of that, the sides of both tools are fairly sharp.  It would have been nice to run them through a machine to take the sharp edge off...it couldn't have added more than a nickel to their manufacturing cost		Even the name "Cusinart" is stamped into thin metal and attached - somehow - to the plastic handle.  It exemplifies the lack of quality in this product.		The Cusinart brand used to define quality.  No more.  They keep putting out stuff like this and they'll be fighting for shelf space at the Dollar Store.
1,After I bought it price was reduced almost 40% Of course it is a loss. Biggest problem with this Greenhouse is zipper it was poorly sewn and plastic lining attached is not strong even though it is very most component and needs to be used very frequently.	Shelves are very thin, it bends when I put a medium size flower pot. For this reason shelves need to be fasten to keep pots safe.	Because of so many similar plastic connectors it takes a lot of attention to install it. Appearance is not bad. I supported the corners and green lines with clear packing tapes. I used nail anchors Weather conditions after I installed was mild. I do not know how it will stand against windy and snowy weather
1,Don't fit
1,When in a windy situation they will bend, used a 2x3 foot flag and ended up throwing away both poles I bought due to poor craftsmanship.
1,The listing, and all pictures of this device, show black numbers on a white or very light background.	NOT CLOSE!	The background is a typical LCD greenish gray background. The only way you get anything close to what is shown in the pictures, is to have an external bright light shining on the meter.
1,clip ends to not line up as in the picture, even when taken out of the package, purchased two set of them, so now I cannot use them (I am not sure if they will hold the flag securely)
1,Mice are too smart to go in it.
1,Noticed no difference in bugs after installed for 2 months. One of the pair has begun emitting an audible obnoxious whine so I stopped using it.
1,Worked really well. Worked great in the beginning - picked up sand, gunk, small leaves, etc. I have a small (7' X 10') spa.	BUT after turning the unit off and on a few times I broke it! The fatal flaw is that there is no switch in the conventional sense. You twist it on and off. But, If you turn it too far, you will split it open. I tried to epoxy it together with out any luck.		Good news. I called the manufacturer about it and they sent me a new one, postage paid. I am keeping the 2 "O" rings well lubricated.
1,used 4 times 4th time turn water on and hose exploded
1,different size from the existing quick connectors that I heve
1,received this 'executioner' device, loaded the attached batteries (in correct directions), noted the red indicator was working correctly when I pressed button on handle, set down the racket to wait for flies, picked it up less than 10 mins later---------noted handle was too hot to hold! quickly ejected batteries, fearing they might explode! turned handle onto patio chair cushion for soft landing, less than 1 minute later one exploded with crackling sound, smoke, and smoke stain onto cushion.......WTF?!?!  this would have BURNED a child, or me, if I had grabbed the handle just a few minutes later.  Even if this dangerous event was caused by faulty batteries vs product design, THE SELLER IS RESPONSIBLE TO CHECK QUALITY OF BATTERIES, and these were dangerous trash! UNSAFE FOR YOUR HOME.
1,Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006, after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them, there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon, but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away.
1,Great looking roses, but I never received the seeds.
1,Bought this relay only to discover that it was defective and so had to order a new one from someone else.  The new one worked well.
1,Only about 1.5 inches in size.  You have to be right up on them to see them.  Maybe OK for a window box to enjoy from inside a home, you would not see them from a sidewalk or the street.
1,Send here for the world to see what was inside (marked 600hps) and the seal for the glass is pretty much none existent. My son had to use silicone sealer to fix multiple leaks. Don't ask about the bulbs. My son knew to buy a cool-burning ushio beforehand.
1,I bought 2 of these based on the good reviews I read and also on the fact that my dad (who lives in south-central Oklahoma) said they work for him.  I gave them a chance based on some of the things said about the moles being attracted to them at first (the box warns you about this), and I have to rate these as a dud for where I live.  I've had them for several weeks (I'd say over 8 weeks) and the moles LOVE them!!!  In fact, I've had increased activity where I've installed them.  I'm really disappointed as I thought this was the answer to my mole problem.  One positive thing:  the batteries are still going strong.  I'm going to give mine to my dad. :-(
1,Some of the packages were Bermuda grass while other packages are some other mixes.
1,I realize that all gas cans come with these caps but I'm not going to give something that is crap a high rating. You really have to buy the easy pour nozzle.
1,Product rusted immediately and cannot read the thermometer. I submitted a complaint and got no response.
1,Broke after 6 months of use. Waste of money.
1,DIDN'T GROW!
1,Listen to the feedback. Terrible product. Literally after one hour of continous run, blade started catching frame to cause loud clicking noise...shakey, motor gets unbalanced and has to play catch up every few minutes. Mounting hardware is cheaply made and broke instantly. There are better products for same money. Do not buy!
1,Did not work as thy said it wood.
1,I bought the Store-It-Out Max model. Like others have experienced, mine arrived bashed up. Part of the lid was broken off, right near where a hinge attaches. I have contacted the company for a replacement lid. One of the sides was also missing a chunk, in the same corner where the lid was broken. A metal piece that runs along the top at the back was also damaged in the same area. I did not bother requesting replacements for those two other parts, since it didn't affect functionality, was not readily visible, and wouldn't be worth disassembling it to replace.		As others have noted, the hinge design is lacking. I took one look at the metal hinges and the plastic lid and thought, "Oh no."		I paid $197 for the Max. It's absolutely NOT worth almost $200. Had I seen it in person, I would not have purchased it at all. It ~might be worth~ $75. It's flimsy as heck. When I open it, it feels like it is just going to fall apart in my hands. I do not expect this to last, and as I sit here writing this, I am contemplating just returning it. It's attractive looking junk. I have Keter shelving which I really like a lot. I was very surprised to have this turn out to be such a lousy, over-priced product.		I purchased this product to store a bale of straw and some other supplies for my chickens. I am not planning to use it in a sheltered area, and given the way it is put together, I think it is highly unlikely to keep water out. I suspect water running down the back of the unit will just go right down in between the base and the back. If it doesn't blow away first. Worse, the area where I plan to put it is not super level, and while I can smooth it out some, this thing isn't going to do well with any kind of surface other than a flat deck, cement floor, etc. It's already unsteady just sitting in my living room.		Do yourself a favor, skip this one an keep looking. It is super over-priced for what it is, and you'll be lucky if it lasts a year.		Assembly was pretty easy. The instructions were actually pretty good. Too bad the product isn't.
1,did not grow
1,Already warped from our crazy Texas summer sun. You might have better luck in more tepid climates
1,Arrived broken, sent it back.  Seeing how easily it broke in shipping makes me think I will look for a different brand next spring.
1,Obviously these are in effective. But makes a great joke gift. So now they are asking me to write at least 20 words. I would not have bought these for any other reason- it was a joke. Who knows maybe they work. I'll never know.
1,The item pictured is right hand thread. The item delivered (that matches the part number however) is left hand thread. There are so many of these available, it's hard to track based on exact model, I always look for the one that has the right thread. The picture was misleading and the item had to be returned.
1,I have two of these, and one of them was indeed used a few years ago by a family of wrens.  However, unless birds in your vicinity are inclined to use another birds' nest, this pocket will probably not be utilized again.  It is impossible to easily remove a previous family's nest.		Best sold as a decoration only, not as a functioning birding item.
1,It didn't rally make any difference in the clarity of the water after two treatments.
1,This is junk all parts leak and won't float
1,I haven't had many hoses that don't kink, and this is a kink hose if there ever was one.  I still use it for now, but will have to replace it as the many kinks have become something I have to hammer out just to drain my pool or fill it.  The house I bought came with another hose made by Craftsman that is dirty and old but only has one minor kink in it.  It's an awkward stiff hose, but strong. I'll have to keep looking for that perfect hose.
1,Consistently shows several degrees too hot. Very legible when you want to know the incorrect temperature.  I'd pay $5 more for one that was correct.  I will take the guts out of this one and put the old cheap gauge from my 40 year old one into this case. That way I will have the correct temperature and legibility.  For the record, you cannot adjust this model by turning the mechanism to get the correct temperature readout.  China ruins everything. Not worth returning for this low price which is what the manufacturer is counting on.
1,Didn't fit my 13BK608 MTD 42" cut mower well and ended up getting hit by blade...you may consider another plug if you have the same mower.
1,It always read green/full and then one night the grill shut off.  Turns out it was out of propane.  Don't trust this gauge.		UPDATE:  After seeing this review, the manufacturer emailed me and sent me a new one.  Nice gesture but... the second one had the same problem!  It always read green until one night... the needle dropped and it ran out in the middle of cooking on Father's Day.  What a mess.		If it matters, I use this with a Broil King Signet 20 grill.
1,The seeds were duds, was unable to get them to grow.
1,Not worth the money.
1,Stopped working after two uses. Crap.
1,We have had a drought here in Austin TX, when I hooked it up the first of June, The first thing I noticed was that the head that hooked to the house was split, then as I let the water expand it, the other end was also broken and looked like someone had tried to fix it.	I should have hooked it up when I first received it.
1,Really disappointed 2 arrived broken & sent them back. The feeders are very cheaply made & could tell someone else had it as it had been put together. :>(
1,I have extremely intelligent moles and for every product that i have tried, they have outwitted me. Moles 9, me 2. I used the entire lot and got not a one dead mole.
1,Rough blend of something that is better suited for cattle feeding than for birds. Birds don't like it at all! Wasted money.
1,I used it on my prize hosta and on two hydrangeas. I used a fairly large quantity of the product on each plant, and it rained shortly after applying the product. This was about two weeks ago. The product should have gotten into the plants' systems within a few days. I also sprayed the plants tp protect them until the Repellex would get absorbed. To my great dismay, this morning I found my hosta completely eaten up. The hydrangeas seem to be OK for now. In brief, it looks like a failure with regard to the hosta.
1,This is a real piece of junk to say the least.  Have you heard of an indoor/outdoor thermometer that the outside unit is not waterproof?  That's right.  The outside unit cannot be allowed to get wet.  I would not buy this unit for a room thermometer much less an indoor outdoor thermometer.  Big mistake on my part.
1,The lower ratings by customers appear to be far more accurate than those reviews giving this grill four and five star ratings. There are many design defects with this grill, which render it undeserving of higher ratings.		The most obvious defect of all is the lack of adequate customer support. This manufacturer provides a negative meaning to the term, "made in America."		It is obvious that with the many negative reviews coming from customers who were denied warranty service, and the responses coming from the owner of this business, that there have been so many problems with the go anywhere grill that this manufacturer can't afford to replace the many defective parts that continue to fail in service.		As to the product itself, it is correct that this grill is useful only in limited grilling situations. Not good for fish, chicken, ribs, etc. This grill is only good for hot dogs, hamburgers and limited cuts of beef or lamb.		Then there is the issue of cleanup. Due to a very poor design, the interior traps cooking juices in areas that can't be readily accessed. Cleanup time far exceeds cooking time so it really is not a pleasure to use.		This manufacturer doesn't make a grill cover. They only make a travel bag and then they refuse to honor a warranty on parts of the grill that soon fail citing the fact that people use this grill while traveling.
1,didn't really see it catching anything,, the bug light I bought caught more... might work some  but nothing noticeable, dd
1,Horrible. Leaks even when turned off.
1,This thing will not stay on. And, when it does actually stay on, it kills nothing! Do Not waste your money, this is just a piece of junk.
1,These roses have yet to germinate. I am very disappointed. What steps would you propose to remedy this?
1,Received the product inside of a small plain box that was not the original packaging. It was all rolled up and completely unusable in that state. Had been rolled up in the box it could not sit flat and kept pushing my seed box around. The mat eventually pushed the box off and roll itself up while powered on...		Not happy with this product. Should have went with something of higher quality, or at least left in the original packaging.		After further inspection, I'm not even sure the product is working. It does not feel as if it is generating any heat at all.
1,Not easy to use.  Need to pay to return it - not worth the effort.  Tossed it in the basement to maybe use on another plant in the future.
1,It's flag desecration, pure and simple.
1,Craptastic. Blue rocks don't glow. And by don't glow I mean don't glow at all. Not even a little bit. Top 10 of worst Amazon purchases of all time.
1,didn't grow
1,I bought this at home depot. We had a few tiny ants in our kitchen every night so we thought we should get traps. I went to the store and got this. And we waited. And waited. Mostly the ants ignored it. Recently we found a bunch of dead ants in it. I didn't really see any ants actually leaving the trap; they were mostly just drowned in it. And now I see lots of ants, mostly ignoring it. So I'm on to the next product, but it seems this product just doesn't work if the ants are too small to get out once they get in, and thus drown in the trap.
1,2 seed grew
1,This weather station has plenty of bells, but unfortunately, metaphorically speaking, very few of them actually ring. First, the unit is fairly large and must be plugged into an outlet for the backlight to work. This greatly limits its placement, at least in my house. You can hang it on a wall, but the cord provided with my unit connects with an L shaped plug that prevents it from hanging flush against the wall. The display is such that if you aren't viewing it at the right, and rather limited, angle, you can't see the numbers very well. By knowing the temperature, time of year and current cloud cover, I can predict the weather with more accuracy than the weather prediction feature. The daily weather history feature simply doesn't work - it seems to be using both the inside  and outside temperatures at whim. The current temperature trend feature is very slow to respond - this morning I watched the temperature rise 6 degrees in less than 30 minutes before the unit's rise/fall indicator went from a straight line to an upward line. I regret buying this device and cannot recommend it.		Update -- I hated this weather station so much I decided to replace it with one I found at Target. I paid enough for this that I didn't want to throw it away, so I took it to work and put in on top of the credenza in my office. Now I hate it even more. The unit is sitting at about 6 feet and is nearly unreadable to me because you have to be standing right in front of it to read the display. I have the outside sending unit sitting next to the display unit  and the outside temperature and humidity are anywhere between 3 to 6 degrees different. So clearly, one of the two is miscalibrated. I either received a lemon, or this unit was made with little to no quality control
1,two small for my intend use of pull start for my roto tiller
1,I received this item today. The shipping carton is undamaged. The product was not padded in the box. The lid on the container of granules was completely unthreaded from the container and it would take 3 or 4 turns of the lid for it to become completely unsecured. The product is spilled into the box and was leaking out of the shipping container. I do not have any intention of cleaning up the mess to return the product only to have another one shipped in the same condition. This product STINKS as in a very strong urine odor. Read the reviews - many customers have complained about Amazon shipping this product and receiving it in an opened condition. Perhaps Amazon should consider taping on the lid onto the container or placing in a plastic bag before shipping. Very disappointed in Amazon!		After using this product, I will update my review.
1,no sign of these coming up. Not good seeds.
1,Plant died after a month.
1,Awful
1,I order Amaryllis bulbs every year and will never order from this seller again.  Out of the 3 bulbs I ordered only one has produced a flower and it is not a Red Lion.  The flowers that bloomed are beautiful, white with pink in the veins.  I planned to give all as Christmas gifts and planted them in time that they should have been ready to bloom either by Christmas or right afterwards. I did give away the one and only that produced a bulb.  Not sure if the others are ever going to do anything other than die.  My first failure in ordering Amaryllis bulbs on Amazon.
1,Package arrived intact and in good order. Upon opening I found an empty plastic bag with no parts in it. Tried to contact the mfg, but their instructions were to contact the seller. Got a smart reply in a chat session with them and no instruction to assemble. Used it one time and the paint is peeling off it. I would imagine rusting will occur shortly. Worst experience I have ever had with an Amazon vendor.
1,No, it burned the leaves, and the black spot continued to grow, so I cut them way back and am starting over. It's probably my own mistakes I made, however.
1,I've had about 50% germination results with these seeds, will not be purchasing again. I always test out survival seed packets to see if they'll actually work when needed, and this package has not delivered. I'm using Pro Mix with mycorrhizae to germinate the seeds inside of a seed starting dome with no luck.
1,Works great for 6 months then pump goes out.  Returned to Karcher (oh my god what a nightmare).  I called 3 times and got the run around and it's been 2 months and still haven't received my replacement.  Karcher customer service is god awful terrible!  It really is a shame to see Karcher name go from a solid reputable company to just another company that has sold itself out to Mexico and China.  Karcher used to be one of the top names in power washers.  I had my first electric Karcher for over 10 years and the last 2 I've purchased haven't lasted 6 months.  Looks like I am switching to another brand.  Do not buy this product!  It is poorly made and their customer service is terrible.
1,I bought these at the hardware store and they worked well, but this batch was leaky and discolored.
1,Don't think we caught more than 3 flies. I was not impressed with this product at all. It was right beside the trash outside too.
1,Love the product, hate the price. I wouldn't have minded so much if the plastic were much heavier.  You'll be lucky to get two season use out of these starter pots.	Great idea, very cheap/lightweight manufacturing.  To bad because I'd buy 30 to 60 of these a year minimum. But fabric grow bags end up being cheaper in the long run.
1,Ran it twice in three months. Garage kept. Won't run properly now. Please spend your money elsewhere on another manufacturer.	Lost all this money and now it's turning fall.
1,My wife has wanted a garden noisemaker for a while now, our neighbor has a motion activated radio that he swears works..  This unit however is a different story.  First there are a bunch of tiny screws you need to remove to access the controls and batteries.  We charged it for 2 days per the directions, then put it out.  We tried it on insects, with correct setting, a couple of hours later, the insects were still there happily munching away.  We've also tried the other noises, the confuse our dog for about 5 seconds, and then he ignores it.  I'm guessing deer and rabbits will react the same, but they haven't been through the yard lately to confirm.  The solar charger does work, and it does make noise, thus the 2 stars.
1,Roundup is a product created by the Monsanto Corporation, which owns 90% of the soybeans produced in the USA. Roundup is designed to kill weeds but it also makes seeds produced from a plant infertile. Monsanto conveniently produces genetically modified seeds (GMOs) that are resistant to Roundup. If a farmer is growing plants without roundup and the plants are polinated by plants with roundup the farmer is legally unable to sell the plants due to copyright infringement. Monsanto also developed agent orange, aspartame, rBGH (bovine growth hormone) and ambien. One would think these practices would be illegal but many Monsanto employees are also notable politicians, supreme court justices and members of the FDA, Monsanto is EVIL!
1,If you fill it up you will get wet:(
1,It is not good at all, very cheap material and was broken after one summer in use.
1,Sorry, but this did not rotate smoothly. It squeeked and chunked around at an uneven rate and just did not work on my relatively new Weber Genesis NG model. I called Weber and they said that each year the models change slightly, perhaps just a few centimeters which may prevent attachments from fitting correctly. The lady's final bit of information: "Things aren't always perfect in the manufacturing process".  Many people have called attention to that ring "handle" at the end of the rotisserie. I too found it to be a terrible design flaw. You can't grab ahold of it to remove the rotisserie, it's very awkward, and very hot. Sadly, I had to this item.
1,I DID NOT purchase through Amazon, but from HD 3 years ago.  CAUTION:  All the metal parts ( hinges, lock, support rod, etc.) are made from some sort of cheap steel that turns into "rust dust" (for lack of a better description)  in no time.  The lock hasp (that I never used, but some people might) disintegrated in about a year.  After 3 years, the support rod was covered in a thick crumbly layer of rust (I just fashioned a new one from a 3/8" aluminum rod I purchased from HD).  The door hinges are ready to go.  Can't believe Suncast can't make the metal parts out of something that won't rust (galvanized steel, or aluminum).  This thing will be totally useless in about a year from now (if that) once the hinges go.  Nice pool supply shed while it lasts, but there's no excuse for the metal parts to give out like these do.  Disposable shed with a short lifespan.
1,The strings broke on the second use of these bags. I do not recommend these bags.
1,As of now, I am extremely disappointed in this product.  I planted them the day I got them in the mail, (March 22nd,) and have yet to have a single sprout, (May 18th).  I am still hoping that they will pop up, but I have a very impatient tortoise on my hands.  It is just my luck that I try my best to grow weeds and I can't....lol.  I will post updates as necessary.
1,Could never get my bromine levels correct. Had to add another floater & add tablets to help. I will be switching
1,Tools Slipped immediately on making up my first new cable wouldn't tighten the nut sufficiently and needed to use pliers .		SAVE YOUR MONEY and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
1,Died immediately.
1,Died immediately the first day after being shipped. Arrived wilted, but looked fine like it could recover. I followed the instructions on the card perfectly and didn't add any fertilizer to help it stay alive per instructions. It was completely dead by day 3.		I think the cause of the problem is that this plant was a cutting instead of an established plant that grew up in the pot. It looked as if the plant was just cut from a larger plant right before they shipped it and put it in the little 4" pot with some soil.
1,The dye didn't last long at all
1,These are not good,  They do not work as expected.  When you disconnect the sleeve from the connector, water will spray every where.  I bought two sets and they all four do this.
1,I thought this little feeder was so cute! And it stuck to my window, so I can watch the birdies feed, right? Nope.	I filled it with sugar water, and hung it on the window. I left for the day and when I returned,		ANTPOCALYPSE WAS ALL OVER MY WINDOW.		The base of this little feeder can't withstand the weight of the liquid inside, and evidently at some point, it gave way, splashing sugar syrup down my window and all over my plants and patio below.	The only thing feeding at this feeder was a trillino ants. *shudder*.		Silly ME, I wanted this to work so badly that I tried again. After a thorough (thorough) rinsing of my potted plants and patio, I refilled the feeder and taped the base on with masking tape.		Repeat the above scenario.		If you are a budding ant collector, buy and use this feeder. Otherwise, save your money and time. Don't bother.
1,I paid $18.00 for this plant all told. Wasn't expecting much but was so disappointed when it arrived.  4" of floppy weak - looking leaves :(
1,Used the belt for about 4 hours and it broke!  I have EVERYTHING NEW on the mower deck so there is no problem with it and while cutting my lawn it comes apart. Well guess what I put the OLD belt back on that has been on it for 3 years and finished my lawn!  So mad I did not even contact the seller did not feel like arguing with anybody just threw the belt in the trash where it belong!!!
1,Strawberries don't grow from seeds, they grow from tubers or runners, don't ever buy something that says "strawberry seeds."
1,Rip off. Seeds did not germinate
1,Fairly priced in my market - and works... what more can you ask?
1,Looks nice, doesn't work. Is supposed to work via the heat/cold expansion and contraction of a metal coil in the mechanism. My outside temp is 47 degrees F and its reading 30. I held it up near to a burner on the stove and it DOES move, but it's not at all accurate. Was a Christmas gift.
1,To me this is a mediocre axe.  Not very heavy, not very sharp, not very balanced, not all that easy to use.  A sort of weak compromise among various qualities you want in an axe.  It may be good for camping, but for general purposes, I can't recommend it.
1,I would not even give this a one star. The flag held up for 5 days and that's not even the worst part ITS MADE IN CHINA I do not want a the UNITES STATES OF AMERICA flag to be made in chine I want it to be mans in AMERICA the land of the free and home of the brave. It is worth the extra money to by a Annin flagmakers	Flag that is 100% made in the USA
1,Only 1 star because there are no shepherd hooks strong enough to hold the planter;they either bend with the weight or swing out of the ground when it is windy.	You will end up with a planter on the ground and a broken tom plant.	Great idea, but it needs some kind of companion stand that works with it.	Anchoring to a railing will loosen your rails. Hooking to the side of your house will wreck the shingles or panels.
1,This is a liquidy version of "Perfect Patch"  Remember that crap?  It didn't work either.. Grows grass anywhere? NOT!!!  When you have to continually water the area, it just washes away and nothing sprouts. The only green that comes from this product is the green dollars THEY make if you buy this garbage. Shame there isn't a NO STARS rating.
1,They worked for two rats then they no longer work.
1,Let me start off by saying that I didn't have huge expectations for this lawn mower when i bought it. That is what makes this review all the worse. It is hard to be disappointed when your expectations are low. My good lawn mower died on me at the end of July. I didn't have a ton of money to spend this late in the season on a replacement so I was looking for something relatively inexpensive that could get me through the rest of this year. If it didn't work next year not the end of the world. I looked on amazon at several different models and for the price and the reviews this one seemed like it would work. It had some negative reviews but more good than bad so I figured those few who wrote bad reviews just were unlucky or expected too much for the price. I was wrong. This thing is the biggest waste of money every. If you pay 20 bucks for it you over spent because all it is good for is scrap. I took the lawn mower out of the box CAREFULLY followed all of the directions for set up pulled the rip cord and... nothing. Not only nothing but the cord didn't go back in. I rewound the rip cord and tried again... still nothing. Amazon of course DOES NOT DO RETURNS on lawn mowers. I've called the company to see if I could get any help but apparently they close at 5pm est... Even if they fix it for free... which i doubt they will this has been such a headache that I still feel like I should at least get some money back... but it doesn't look like that is going to happen. How can you sell someone a broken piece of crap that doesn't work straight out of the package and do nothing for the customer? What a load of crap. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! If you are given it as a GIFT GIVE IT BACK THAT IS HOW MUCH THIS SUCKS!
1,Extremely difficult to fit onto the tail of the sweep unlike what came with the sweep when it was new. If you cannot get it fully on then it wear 5 x times faster. Will re-consider buying these again.
1,Received broken.
1,Sounds good, but my lid is so tight that it won't fit over the tool hanging lips.
1,Mine is similar in design to this bought from Walmart two years ago. Works great if you can get it started. Lots of luck with that. I do know that I bought some Ryobi attachments that hook up nicely. I'm going to get a ryobi head at Home Depot to go with my utensils and scrape this thing. Just won't start most of the time.
1,The sides bow out a couple of inches. This happened even filled with light planter mix.  The clips to join 2 beds together were not included.  I had to call and get them. I've had many lifetime products and they have always been well made and a good value...until now.  I am Very Unhappy with the 2 garden beds I just purchased,
1,Breaks after one season
1,The directions say apply FOAM directly to soil.  This does not foam at all, it just pushes clear liquid out of the dispenser.  Since its not foaming i have no idea how much to add to each plant since directions are based on fertilizer that is a diluted with a huge amount of air, aka foam. Too much of this fertilizer can burn/kill the plants so its not user friendly at all.
1,I used these seeds in my hydroponic garden and not 1 of the 7 pods sprouted.  I put multiple seeds in each pod.  I am going to attempt a second time and will update the review if I have the same results.		Note: In the seeds defense: I am in no way form or fashion a gardener of ANY sort!
1,If it were possible to give it a negative review I would. It only lasted one season despite following all the recommended preventative maintenance. This second season all it would display is low salt despite it being exactly @ the 3k ppm it desires. I tried calling intex and the first operator hung up on me when I requested information on the replacement parts and the second was even less comprehendible than the first. Neither could speak English.		If you want a cheap system to last you one, maybe two, season(s) then this is your product.  However, I would not recommend Intex to anyone. Spend the extra $ and get something that might last longer.
1,Very pretty. But the light only worked for a few days.
1,Yes it covers the smoker, but blows off really easy.  Plus it is not water proof.  It was irritating to take the cover off and find water all over it.  What is the purpose of this if it doesn't stay on or keep my smoker dry?
1,Leather split at--first use.  Shame.  It's very nice looking and made with what seemed to be quality materials.  Did I get a dud?
1,Did not grow
1,I bought this at a box store, not on Amazon, but that doesn't make it any less a piece of crap.		At first it did ok cutting through some limbs, I actually feel like I got a good chunk of work done, but about 30 minutes into the job the blade just stopped.  The motor kept working but the blade wouldn't spin.  That's when I saw the smoke coming out.  I had the same problem where the bearing got so hot that the plastic housing melted, essentially destroying the drive assembly.  I made sure to follow the instructions, which along with other reviews tells me this is just a design flaw.		I called the customer support, which essentially doesn't exist.  They do not offer any kind of return service or troubleshooting.  Instead an automated voice sends you to an authorized service dealer, who will also tell you they can't fix it because it's not a replaceable part.  At that point, rather than try and deal with an exchange I packaged it back up and demanded my money back from the box store.  They (luckily for me) obliged, and took it back.		From what I hear after sharing my story, just don't buy anything with the name Remington on it unless it's a gun. I'll be buying another brand to finish this job.
1,Doesn't work - leaks gas from the tank.
1,The description states that it is a 12 inch BBQ Grill Brush AND IT IS NOT. The only reason I purchased it was because is was supposed to be 12 inches. The description is misleading and not true!!!
1,This product was a different color than the first I purchased (from a garden supply store) it didn't work nearly as well, either.
1,did not sprout
1,I am totally unable to grow chives. Two packets of 300 seeds each, and I am still struggling.
1,Did not fit.
1,The mice/rats have not touched it since I put it in with the chickens.
1,what about birds  this sounds like a bird chaser to
1,I ordered a pair of 1.5 ft extender cables. I received a bag with just one single cable. I am having trouble getting second cable. Totally useless without complete pair
1,Had a problem with this angel.  After only a couple days she wouldn't recharge.  Also, the light from the bird isn't very bright.
1,I'm surprised at all the good reviews this product has received.  I bought a product called Fountain Clear and the stuff, while somewhat expensive, worked like a charm.  I thought I'd save some money and try these and boy am I sorry I did. I thoroughly cleaned out my bird bath, added a cleaner pack, and within 8 days I had a scum filled bird bath.  I repeated the cleaning and added a new cleaner pack and ended up with the same scum filled birdbath within 8 days.  Going back to the more expensive but tried and true Fountain Clear.
1,Nothing germinated with these seed and I did research on line to find out what specifics needed to be done to grow them.
1,Came in practically dead.  Could be that it was boxed and out of sunlight for the week it took to be delivered.  In any case, it was almost dead and did die within a day or so of receiving it.
1,Learned after buying it that it was easier and safer for the birds to make your own.  They say the red dye can cause the birds problems
1,I bought from this person before I got 1 little tuber if that it never sprouted .for what you buy here you can get 3 of the same thing for less price at easy  too grow bulbs. Com
1,China
1,Easy install and setup.	Operated flawlessly for about two months, then Wunderground started continuously displaying "PWS not responding".	Acurite display still had 4 bars of normal data being received from the instrument array, Acurite software showed "display detected", and "waiting for data".	Software never received data again.	Another one in the junk box.		Ed B.
1,Updated Review:	Well, these high priced grates didn't even make it through two seasons before they started rusting so badly that it would flake off onto the food. I tried my best to keep them cleaned and oiled, but regardless of how hard I tried, the rust won out. I just purchased the Weber 7586 stainless grates to replace these and they are really heavy duty. Hopefully, they'll give me a much longer lifespan than these cast iron grates did.		Original Review Below from Jan '12:	Although it is a little pricey, I would definitely recommend this grating as an upgrade over their stock steel grate. It does an outstanding job of retaining heat and putting a nice sear on the meat. I doubt that I'll ever have to replace these.
1,The package with the baqs was open.  It was missing 2 of the 3 black plastic support rings that thread through the top.  So two of the bags have no support. Now I have to request a refund.  What a waste of time
1,Seams are weak. First use and the seam on the bottom of one blew out and lost all the sand
1,On paper the Black & Decker CM1936 is a great idea: an electric, cordless mower that can keep pace with some of the lower powered gas mowers. If you've got a small yard or live in a dry climate than this mower will do the trick for you. However, if you've got a large yard or live in a humid climate the CM1936 may not be the mower you are looking for.		The mower is well assembled and easy to unbox and get ready. It takes 12 hours to charge the battery for the first time, but once it's charged, it's easy to get mowing. The mower has a push button start and is relatively quiet. This model isn't self propelled although it's not very heavy. The biggest problem we experienced with the mower was that it just doesn't do well with tall or damp grass. Over a patch of thick clover it chocked up and almost stalled out (something I didn't expect from an electric mower). With slightly damp grass the mower also didn't really have the power to throw the grass in the catch bag and left about 15-20% of the clippings on the lawn.		Ultimately this mower just felt underpowered. For a reasonable size lawn with grass that wasn't 100% bone dry and in need of a mow, the Black & Decker CM1936 just wasn't up to the task.
1,This crap is made out of paper..
1,I love this when I purchased in 2014, I used in just during the summer months and stored in in a dry shed during the winter months. I purchased two of these along with a number of their other products. The ones I used in my Gazebo are doing well. These two lounges do not hold up well outside at all. I live in NC where our weather is mild. The material on the lounges is cracking and unraveling. I am very disappointed. They are fine for inside but nor outside unfortunately most of us buying this type of furniture want to use it outside.
1,a little messy.
1,Received this today.  Spent time reading set-up directions.  Set it up.  Seemed to work well: it wound up hose as advertised. It worked well until I went to unwind the hose.  It tuned out the the bottom controller which goes back and forth leading the hose to wind evenly over the reel, was not connected to the a bottom railing as it was supposed to be. As I unwound the hose, it would jam against the top of the exit opening. More than frustrating after all the time and effort I had spent in assembling it.
1,did not fit my equipment
1,Piece o crap. Bolt that holds swing arm in place doesnt move. Swing arm also bent and difficult to move.
1,Problem with size not as described
1,I couldn't wait to receive this toad house as we have a homeless toad living on the carport.  Boy, was I disappointed!  Not only did it arrive broken and had to be returned, it was of such poor quality that I felt stupid for purchasing it and paying $15.00 for it.  The roof is kind of cute but the bottom housing portion is so thin, I'm not at all surprised that it didn't survive the transit.  Also, the bottom wouldn't even sit level because of the poor quality of the mold used to make it.  Anything at the dollar store would be better than this!
1,hate it
1,used this for 3 weeks, and nothing "revived". I've had much better luck with a good flush and Great White. BUYER BEWARE!!!!
1,The only thing i ever saw it kill was moths at night. The mosquitoes and gnats were not bother by it.
1,Product does not live up to the description.  It does not "blast" anything, nor help with the algae.  I thought this would jumpstart my pond for the spring, but it did not.  I will not purchase again.
1,I really liked the idea of simply planting the pots with the seedlings. However, some seedlings (peppers and basil) really could not get going until I put them in plastic pots, and some died off before I could transplant them. The tomatoes and nasturtiums did well, but after the other seedlings had trouble, I decided to remove one of the peat pots. I discovered that the tomato roots were circling around, trapped under the first interior layer of the pots, unable to break through, although the pots were damp and soft. So I decided to remove all of them. I wet them thoroughly first, to soften them up, and then peeled off in layers. It was difficult and reqired a lot of time to remove the pot layers without tearing the roots. I may have left the seedlings in the pots too long, but I don't think that the tomato roots would have made it out of the pots if I had planted them in the ground. If you use them, put the pots in the ground as soon as your seedlings sprout to avoid root binding, and make sure the ENTIRE peat pot is below the surface of the dirt. Otherwise the top edges and sides will never soften up and may still trap the roots.
1,Glyphosate is a "probable carcinogen"
1,Meh. It's one species of one family. Better results with more comprehensive inoculates (i.e. Bio-Live from Down to Earth, Great White).
1,While I agree that the overall flow of this is small, I did like the choice of some of the sprays.	My trigger broke after fairly light use for two seasons. I drilled out the rivet, put a hose clamp on the trigger	and am still using it attached to a cheapo threaded nozzle.
1,Broke after few months of use. Cheap plastic.
1,Does not filter. Used two of them and both were useless.
1,I had/have wasp, hornets or yellow jackets going into my attic.  So I tried traps outside where they are getting in, here are the four I tried... hopefully this will help you decide which is best for your situation.  I live in the Northwest though (Western WA), you may have different results depending on where you live. Some traps were great, some where an absolute waste of money:		***Rescue Reusable WHY trap:	http://www.amazon.com/Rescue-W%C2%B7H%C2%B7Y-Hornets-Yellow-jackets/dp/B001H1GRPI/ref=sr_1_7?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1407612209&sr=1-7	'WHY' buy this?  Don't, I paid $18 to kill two wasps or yellow jackets.  It has a top and bottom trap, they weren't interested in the top trap at all.  I saw up to five almost immediately inside the bottom trap, but then I watched them walk right out of the trap.  Utterly useless.		***Rescue Yellow Jacket Disposable trap (West of the Rockies version) :	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TBKL/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1	Works great, after 2 days I have almost 20 caught and killed.  You have to supply your own string or wire though, and they were more money at the time of this writing than another solution below.  I'd recommend this though depending on the price.		***Tanglefoot 300000437 Wasp Bag Trap:	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M2VZZI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1	My top choice, it is reusable if you want, just buy more attractant.  And at the time I orderd it was about half the cost of the Rescue one above.  After 2 days it caught nearly 20 as well.  Has it's own wire for hanging, made of hefty plastic that can be reused several times if you want with a 'zip lock' top.  I like this one a lot, and it was the cheapest but is made the best.		***Victor Poison-Free M370 Yellow Jacket Magnet Disposable Bag Trap:	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RNH2NI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1	Stay away from this, after 2 days it has caught a grand total of 0
1,I only used this mower twice and after that it became hard to push and I can't even cut the grass where I already gone once with my tractor. On the first 2 uses the mower worked fine it was easy to push then all of the sudden it has become impossible to push.	Now reading other reviews it looks like people have problem with blades getting dull quickly thus the mower becomes useless, but  I still have to take it apart and find out why.
1,cheap poor quality thier lighting up a garbage dump it tampa now
1,I have a ton of pressure from my pump and it still gets stuck I guess I could have to much pressure but all my other accessories work great.  also It will not thread on correctly.
1,Not what I hoped for.  The suction lasts a split second, so it doesn't pick up more than one leaf at a time. I'll go back to vacuuming the spa with the pool vacuum hose even though it's a pain in the neck.
1,not working.  Rat got off even they step their feet on it.  I saw foot prints but none of Micky was there.
1,didn't last very long
1,one end not sealed pull off first time
1,Always been pleased with products from Amazon. BUT this is the filmsist peace of junk I have ever seen. Looks like it's made for one season . A heated mat that you place below a thin plastic formed planter box, the cover is so flimsy it scares me to pick it up. Going to keep it, wanting to start some seeds. Hoping it makes the spring in the green house. Don't say u weren't worned .
1,Hard made a dent in the algae wouldn't recommend
1,Update five months later:		I'm having to replace the tires again.  It only takes 2 hours to cut my lawn and the tires have about 50 hours on them but the tread is just about gone and threads are showing through in several spots.  I always check the tire pressure and I'm just driving on a typical lawn... no crazy stuff or gravel roads.
1,I purchased this and when I opened it, you could tell immediately that there was something wrong.  The padded sticker on the front was falling off and when I opened the bottom it to ensure that the bulb was intact, I found the entire inside of the unit Full of Dead bugs.  The Unit didn't work at All and you could tell it was a used model and someone had Returned it.  I immediately sent it back for a refund and Ordered from someone else.
1,The grill arrived and it was damaged.  It appears the top was dropped or crushed.  The thermometer was also damaged.  Seems very flimsy and not well built.  Not worth the money.
1,Another Perky Pet product that has failed gloriously. For being the "largest" bird feeder manufacturer, one would think that they would have the experience/knowledge to make decent feeders. Considering all the smaller manufacturers that they have bought out etc.....Galvanizing a poor choice for a coating for a base as noted previously by a veterinarian in earlier comments . The galvanizing apparently is so poorly applied that it rusted through inside of a few months. I purchased mine January 14, 2017, it started to rust within a few months , today is May 28th, 2017 and I will no longer use this feeder . In my opinion it as toxic to the birds and they stopped using long ago anyway. I live in the dry Sonoran desert of ARIDzona so if I have a problem (plus my area is still in drought having seen likely less than 1 and 1/2 inches of rain since January.) So excessive moisture is not the problem coming back to the feeder. Many others have commented on the rusting problem yet Perky pet still proudly sells this product . RUST contaminates the nectar, when a person looks through the lid of a transparent feeder, the inside if the lower basin is a highly humid area. Moisture gathering on the inside of the roof dripping down into the nectar pool carrying rust (Iron) into the nectar. Hummingbirds die from iron toxicity.		Get a clue Perky Pet
1,Returned, waste of money
1,Bought these because I noticed silver fish in my house.  Since I purchased these and set them up, still see silver fish, but not in the traps and the silverfish are still nearby.
1,am VERY not happy with this item. because it blew away in a  strong wind, and I mean....... not be found ANYWHERE.  I  would  blame that on the wind and get another one , but I can't because... I resent the fact that the price ...did not JUST go up ( in a three month period) ...but  literally, nearly doubled going from 17$ to 29$ ...nearly overnight. The cover was three months old when I needed another one to replace it. It is an insult to the  public to do such drastic and non professional greedy looking 'moves' like this.  so I ordered their thinner cheaper one for 7.00, and it has blown away three times in a month, but  each time, with this one...I keep seeing it somewhere around the  yard and saving it.  One  time the neighbors dropped it off on my front porch for me.  interesting thing though is this: when I went back online to see if the black one had stopped thinking it was 'gold'... I noticed the cheap blue one had gone  up 2.00, ....in a month? come on , weber, stop playing head games and act normal. Inch your prices up a little at a time over a reasonable period of time.
1,These do not work. Put them in as instructed and the gophers made brand new holes right next to it!
1,Terrible packaging. Plant was sickly.
1,The trigger doesn't work.  Taking it back.
1,Teeny tiny bird feeder. Lid feels very flimsy
1,This is not a good blower. It's far too weak. I had to turn it on full power to blow the leaves. Even then, it won't pick up wet leaves well so you can only use it after a dry spell.		Also, the battery consumption is too fast. I have a 700 sq ft front yard and it takes an entire battery to blow the leaves in it. I recommend getting another battery so you can swap it out in the middle of a job without stopping.		The mulcher is utterly useless. I had to basically cover the leaves with the nozzle to get them vacuumed. At that point, it sucks up the dirt, which came right through the fabric of the bag, and sprayed all over my clothes.
1,It works but what a mess.
1,I bought this for the fly problem we get every year. Decided to use it indoors, gave it a few days. The flies completely ignore it, I would not recommend this product.
1,Great for one handed use. Great for grass seed.  Terrible for everything else.	I bought mine from HD.  I used it for grass seed and it was fast and easy.  I used it for Insect killer and it was the best.  It allowed for one handed use.  I was able to get up to the house, behind and under bushes.  I thought it was the greatest spreader until I cleaned it.	After emptying the unused insect killer back into the bag, the static build up was so bad that the entire inside of the hopper was covered.  I tried to wipe it off but it was in the smallest places.  This was never a problem with my other spreaders because I just rinsed them with water. Being a battery operated spreader this wasn't my first choice, but I didn't see any other way... besides, why would Scotts make a battery spreader that couldn't get wet.  So I gently rinsed it out.  I hung it in my garage to drip dry and it dripped for hours.  I decided to check the battery compartment and it was soaking wet.  I understand it not being water "proof" but this isn't even water resistant.	VERY POOR DESIGN for an outdoor product.  There is no way to clean it.
1,Very dissappointed...	Always had good luck with late summer romaine and spinach. My spinach came up fine this time (other brand) but this romaine only yielded 1 small plant.  Soil is great, planted at proper depth, good water, no rodents ate seeds...
1,At first they worked great but then one night it didn't shut off like it should have. That lead to my lawn flooding and a water bill 6x more expensive. Save a little up front cost me much more in the end. Should have spent a little more
1,...the black plastic "posts" that the white pawls rotate on are cheap and break easily if you catch the engine on the compression stroke while pull starting. (ACR is working correctly)  I also have a lawnmower with the same Briggs engine on it.  It has the exact recoil on it and coincidentally it broke about a week after I ordered this recoil for my pressure washer (the black plastic "posts" broke)  So what I did with that one is I drill out the plastic where those posts used to be and with a pair of needle nose vice grips inserted a small screw which I cut the head off of.  The screw in metal "posts" I fabricated to fix my mower recoil have not broken yet.  Briggs, wake up.
1,I put the grill together in about 2 hours - then I tried to remove the sticker that seems to be standard on products these days as if they were going on display somewhere. It di not peel from any angle well and in fact only the outermost portion came off in most areas. Where I was lucky - only a few square inches of glue remained. I tried everything that help sites said to remove stubborn stickers and spent 10$ at the store getting goo-gone and alcohol. Finally after 3 or 4 hours of sweat I got a power washer and it slowly blasted off. I do not know if the surface was compromised in terms of life but there is still the shadow of where it was on the grill.  I saved the label from the box but there is no indication how long it sat in a warehouse. It came from china. I assume it was exposed to some heat somewhere and the normally removable sticker became permanent - it ruined the purchase. If I had not cut up the box - I'd have sent it back.		Good grill- AWFUL experience
1,I never had a hose that kinked more than this one.!!!
1,The bird feeder looks very nice and the birds liked it. It was easy to refill, the overhang keeps the food dry even when it rains, and the food is well accessible for the birds. So from a bird perspective, it is great, and I would give it 5 stars.	HOWEVER, its squirrel-proofness (patented sure-lock cap system) failed miserably, and in fact, the squirrels broke it in less than a month.		So if you can find a place or a method to keep the squirrels away, this might me a good feeder, but for me it was a failure.
1,This cover lasted 3 weeks before the material tore.  It gets brittle when it is cold outside.  Love Weber products though not in love with this cover.  Velcro will hold the cover down in the strongest wind unless you forget to cinch it down before the wind starts blowing.
1,Never sprouted.
1,This is good for one year. Not durable at all.
1,Mine cracked straight across in two places at around the six month mark. What they don't tell you about this panel is that it should be mounted and left. I used it around my travel trailer without a stand since I felt it should be sturdy enough for outdoor use under different conditions. I really wanted to love this panel. Not sure I would purchase one like this again. Too susceptible to being damaged,
1,Spray head design is crap.  I bought 2 bottles.  1 came with broken spray on/off red lever, the other wasn't broken but leaked crazy.  Very difficult to connect to hose to spray trees.  Majority of the product leaked out around the spray head rather than being sprayed to the citrus tree.  As a result, it wasn't effective.		I bought the concentrated bottle and a gardener's poly sprayer with tank instead.
1,Would not turn on .... right out of the box. Returned for credit. Bought another locally at H.D. that works ... and I have a place to easily return, as I'm anticipating the need to do so within the warranty,  based on this experience and that of others regarding the faulty power switch.
1,The texture is difficult to work with.
1,These things simply did not work for me.  They failed to attract enough insects.
1,Didn't work.
1,This boot scraper/brush looked like just what I wanted for my front and back porches. Unfortunately, it is just some heavy wire coils surrounding a relatively soft short-bristled brush material. This is much less substantial than it looks. More wire than brush. Worst of all, there are no mat or feet on the bottom where the wire coils are completely exposed, meaning that this brush will tear up any floor it is used on. There is not even any frame to try to attach feet to. Maybe it would be ok on unfinished concrete, but it would still scratch it up. I wouldn't even dare try it on my wooden porch decks. Back they go to Amazon. Very disappointing.
1,I was really disappointed I won't order this anymore!
1,Plant was hurting when it got to me.	Shipping took forever n plant eventually died from it.
1,The spa was very easy to set up but it did I seem like the hoses and pump unit was on the flimsy side. Everything worked when it was turned on and no leaks but it has one major flaw, unit does not heat up! I've had it in for three days now in the southern part of North Carolina and I have yet to see it get higher than 88 degrees.  The heater is obviously under powered, if it can't warm up the spa in the south ring outside it should be redesign acted as an indoor unit ONLY. Do not purchase for outdoor use, unfortunately I purchased it a couple months ago and didn't get it set up until this week so I'll be stuck with it, my only option is to rig up another heating unit because theirs doesn't work.
1,It isn't usable here because this version has no way to set the distance of the crawl. The little truck is moved by a chain. It goes all the way down and then all the way back.
1,I have a 1/2 acre lawn, and most is on a gentle slope.	If I try to go sideways, it fell over EASILY (top heavy/too narrow)!		Even when I go up/down, it falls over at the slightest bare spot!	It also commonly does not shutoff when it gets to the ramp- goes a ways & falls over.	The stuck sprinkler arms often dig a large hole, when it falls over!	~~~		I finally gave up & had a Rainbird buried system professionally installed-	I have to replace 3/4 broken Rainbird heads a year (usually discovered after I see large dead spots!)!	The Rainbird heads "supposedly" have a 5-year warranty, but the "only" local authorized dealer balks at replacing them (I show him the installation receipt too!).	Catch22!- If I TRY & complain to Rainbird, the refer me back flaky dealer!		It is now a mix of Rainbird/Hunter heads.	I have only had the new Hunter heads section a year, and I hope they last longer/more dependable!?	The Rainbird heads cover MUCH better though, and hope their new model replacement heads last better (no new ones bad in 2-years?)?		I wish I could offer you a more viable solution!?
1,I ordered two of these and both came with the sails snapped off.  Upon further inspection without opening the cheap packaging, I observed that they use hard plastic to attach the sail.  The sail should have been attached using flexible plastic, after all this is going to go in a pool with people swiming.  I assume that anyone that purchases these thermometers will eventually end up with a row boat, not a sail boat.		After wasting all my money the first two years of having our pool on many different thermometers, I finally found one that's excellent and cheap.  The Jed Pool Model 20-208 is the best I've found.		You want a pool thermometer that will actually SINK NOT FLOAT.  That you can just attach to a string on your latter and pull up when ever you want an accurate temperature.  The Jed Pool Thermometer also holds water where the bulb measures the temperature.		I appologize if this review wasn't solely on the actual product but I thought I'd let you know what I found worked best for our 20 x 44 foot pool.
1,This shovel is for a child not an adult.  You MAY be able to use it as an emergency shovel for the car!
1,not a single seed sprouted, followed directions.
1,This is not sturdy or of good quality. Buy something better
1,I was so optimistic but haven't caught any fleas
1,This is not 50 feet.	I have to pull with all my strength to get it about 18 feet from the spigot.	Would normally have returned the item - but I do have a place where I need a shorter hose, so I'll keep it....	But if you think you'll get anywhere near 50 feet - forget this one!
1,Looks great up top BUT flip it over and the backing is torn a third of the way through. The staple holes probably make things worse.
1,Rated tops in In-Ground Pool Alarms.  It may be but we were not willing to drill a hole in the pool surround to mount it and find out.  Only the box shows it has a stabilizing "pin".  Its existence is not described anywhere pre-purchase.  After buying the product, you either see the pin mentioned on the box or open it up and then find what is the thickness of a nail, not a pin, which must fit in a drilled hole.  We were really disappointed.  I think it used to be made without the pin but could be wrong. Don't know where to go from here.
1,Planted the seeds three separate times and they failed to germinate so I just went to the nursery and purchased plants. No longer trying to save money
1,After three orders I got one with lid now will it catch mice, will lit you no.
1,I have had it in the yard for three weeks and not one beetle has shown any interest. I followed the instructions and hung it like the instructions said and the beetles ignore it.  I was hoping I had found my answer to the Japanese Beetles that ruin my lawn, but no such luck.  My backyard chickens do a better a job of chasing the beetles down and getting rid of them.  I am really disappointed it does not work at all and would not recommend.
1,No instructions
1,Does not work.  I see ants going right past it like it was nothing but a piece of plastic.. which it is.  Waste of $$!!
1,Not one plant grew. I planted the pods in the fall as per the directions and I do not have a single Milkweed growing now and it is June 11 on Long Island, NY.
1,wrong product for barbq tanks
1,Does not work
1,Works great.  Clears the pool quickly.  But when I sprayed off my filter, there was a massive amount of Grayish stuff that came off everywhere.  I am not sure what the grayish stuff was, but I don't want it in my pool water.
1,This mower was awesome - in fact, it's still in perfect mowing condition after 4 uses, except for the front height adjustment mechanism, which has completely sheared off. The front adjustment assembly is a mix of plastic and metal - a metal lever adjusted and locked onto different height settings - pretty much like any other mower. Except the nubs which the lever locks onto are made out of soft plastic, and after mowing my yard 4 times, they have already ripped off. The mower can only be used below its lowest setting now, which means it mows the dirt, because there is no way to set it to any other level due to the amazing and incomprehensible cheapness in this one small area. This must save them in the neighborhood of a nickel per mower, but has made the entire product useless.		As usual, Amazon has been a joy to work with. After trying to contact LAWN BOY, i finally found an email to adress complaints towards. I opted to speak to a real person. Less than 3 months after purchase, and less than FIVE HOURS of use, the mower is bricked. I'm shocked. This is otherwise such a high quality mower. What could possibly justify this complete and baffling oversight?
1,after receiving this, I assembled it and tried it out. I found the control of movement to lag a bit and found that if you are not really careful, it runs right off the end of the gutter, crashing to the ground. Maybe with a LOT of practice, this would be good, but it still did not take out any packed material like pine needles. I do have a powerful blower, so am pretty sure that's not the problem.
1,Bought it to keep stray cats away.  Seems as though it has.  However, since putting it out, have had a bat and a raccoon visit in close proximity to it, and never had either before.
1,This nozzle is a real disappointment to me because it lacks the power I need to wash my boat.  There is a cheap nozzle I buy at Lowe's that is much more powerful than this one. This nozzle is too big and therefore clumsy to hold. I don't recommend it.
1,Wasn't happy with assortment being all the same. They seem very dried put even after soaking.
1,The traps I received were not the ones pictured.  I wanted the ones with the flower design on them, because I already had some, and they worked with my ants.  I had already bought the ones with the smooth rectangle shape, which did not work.  What I received from Amazon were the smooth rectangles again.  I am convinced they do not have the same chemicals, because I put them side by side.  The ants worked like crazy on the old style, while the ants that walked up to the openings of the new ones, never walked in.  I will have to look for the older style at local stores.
1,I think I need to take this to the grinder and round off the edges a bit.  I use it on my Blackstone 36" griddle and the first time I used it I got some large scratches.  I had been using a wood handled scraper that never scratched, but bought this because I can put it in the dishwasher.  I'll go back to the wood handled one until I can do some filing on the corners of this one so it doesn't scratch my cooktop.
1,Did not kill any weeds. Terrible and expensive product
1,Get your plants from another company folks! Like others have stated they come damaged and the ones that weren't are root rot.
1,Sprinkled about 1/4 of the packet in 1/2 inch of dirt and nothing grew, Watered it lightly for the soil to become moist and nothing. Been 4 Weeks. pot is watered daily and in direct sunlight for most of the day. After a few months found the seed laying around so I decided to pour all of them in the vegetable garden all my vegetable grew nothing else did that I have never seen before or have recognized as lavender.
1,We use it for leaves, blowing and sucking. It lasted 18 months before the switch (variable speed) died. Seems this is a design flaw and happens to everyone. We have had this model and the one below it, they both use the same switch AND THEY BOTH BROKE. This model does not deserve it's high rating on here (or Consumer reports) because basically it's a rental for 12 to 18 months, then you throw it away.
1,Doesn't work.
1,Didn't produce!!!
1,Poorest set of instructions I've had on 4 other 'Professional Weather Stations' all over $100.  The USB connector wire is about 18" long so it 'almost' has to sit on your lap if you want to use your PC.  Secondly, and I still don't know how, and I was an Engineer for 30 years, do they consider my Time zone.  Choice is 1-12.  That doesn't compute to EST, CT, MT, Eastern United States.  The distance from Greenwich Means Time I totally don't know how to figure. Half of the displays instead of letters has a small 'x'  And what does "WAxING GIBVBBOUS MOON" mean???  That keeps flashing and there isn't anything about it in the small, incomplete, confusing 'pamphlet'.  Buyer beware.
1,Useless, if you have both arms broken like I did when a tornado swept through town. The Animal Deterrent Spray just sat next to me in the dark as I could do nothing with broken arms. I tried to shake it with my toes but it takes years of practice unless you were born with lobster feet.
1,This is a poorly designed system.  1) the "lid" for a trash can requires a very special "folded over" rim in order to fully secure top, and this is NOT mentioned in advertisement.  (2) the stiffness and weight of the 8 foot tubing is sufficient to tip over any collecting trash can unless can is armed with a heavy weight, and who in the world would want to carry that around?  (3)  the "universal" fitting of the collar to the vacuum device doesn't fit securely, suffering the same problem as the lid attachment.  This defies Newton's 3rd law of physics: " For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Translation:  this Worx product simply falls apart when used as intended.
1,The "Ultimate" pole system isn't very ultimate - the pieces don't fit together snugly enough, my pole leans to the side quite a bit - despite the fact that I bought the matching Droll Yankees Pole auger.  The whole system is WAY overpriced for what you get, in my opinion.  They say it will last a lifetime - we'll see.  A lifetime of a pole leaning 9-12 inches from its proper upright position.
1,I bought this unit because it looked better constructed than some of the cheaper ones.  It clogs (even if one strains the material to be sprayed before filling it) and is therefore pretty useless.
1,I bought the quick connector set to make a 100 ft hose out of my two 50 ft ones. Easy to use but leaked where the two hoses connect. I have yet to find a connector that doesn't leak there.
1,Do not waste you money on this product.  No germination at all even when following the directions.  Moreover, it is an environmental hazard. The power or sticking agent is really a mes to work with and gets all over every thing on opening.
1,While it did kill stink bugs, on full contact, it took quite a while. They crawled or flew away,  and died about 10 minutes later. I would not recommend it as other, cheaper insecticides work better.
1,Did not realize they were made of fabric.
1,I upgraded to one of these in 2010.  Just after the one year warranty ended, in 2011, I had to replace all the wheels because of a bad factory design.  The plastic wheels could not handle the pressure from the metal drive shaft and would just smooth "or ream out" the interior of the wheel.  I contacted my local pool supply dealer who said that I should contact Polaris as they know about the flaw and would only handle claims from people who complained.  Polaris did send me the newly designed metal insert type wheels for free.		In 2012, I had to buy the "interior kit" for a couple of hundred dollars.  Even after that the float head" leaked (a $15 part) but since Polaris did not have any in stock I would have had to buy the entire top housing unit" ($78 part) just to replace the float head".		I am now going into year three and it is starting to malfunction" again.		Bottom line - I do not recommend buying it!!
1,This material DOES fade within the first year.
1,ordered 2 one has already blown...... Didnt make it 2 months.		Update..... Both have blown....... very cheap never kept out side only used few times. Disappointed to say the least
1,Missing parts and discs!!!!	Worthless....looks used!
1,only few seeds in each pack. not worth it
1,Worked in seeds and we had lots of rain and watered on all dry days but still only saw poor and slow germination rate.
1,This starts deteriorating very fast and accumulating calcium deposit ; all of them leaks like a open faucet and I can't return it after a few months ; a waste of money lots of frustration. The idea is great but too cheaply made.
1,Had almost given up that my hummers were going to adopt this new feeder.  I followed the instructions to hang the empty old feeder nearby but wasn't seeing much interest from the birds.  At best, they hovered near the new feeder like "what's this?" and then moved on.  Finally today I saw some diners.  They were cautious at first but now seem to have settled in.  I enjoy being able to actually see the birds reach down into the nectar and feed.  Can't yet address the durability of the plastic material or if the bees and other flying insects will stay away from it and allow the hummers to feed in peace.  It seems like it will be super easy to clean and fill and that's a big plus for me.		UPDATE:  I thought that the birds had adjusted to the change in feeders, but eventually I noticed that they weren't coming to feed as much as they had been before.  So I went back to the feeder that they do use.  I also had a problem with this not hanging properly.  I tried to adjust the hook that it hangs from, but never could get it right.  Too bad - I really liked this design but now it's sitting in my garage.
1,tried the pH measurement first because it does not need calibration. I measured the same pool water sample 3 times and got 3 different results!
1,Sorry I just can't recommend this stuff.  It didn't keep my small fountain clear and didn't dissolve in the water.. Eventually my fountain clogged and when i took it apart I found a large "clot" of this yellow powder clogging the tube, obviously had built up over time as I used small amounts as directed.  I find the liquid type fountain clarifiers work better. I'd never use this again.
1,It's powerful, the cage is handy, the ball joint is a clever way to add flexibility to the connection between the pump and tubing, but ultimately a pump needs to pump. It can't just sit there and if it does fail it needs to be manufactured by someone who will air least offer a a repair service or exchange this for a refurb unit. I was told that these devices simply cannot be repaired. There is a warranty service but I believe I am outside of that since finding my receipt will be impossible.	Pond pumps have the reliability of inkjet printers running on a Windows computer, and this pump is no exception. This thing is too expensive for it to be reasonable that there are no repair options available.	Aquascape did provide 2 somewhat local dealers to help me prevent my fish from dying by buying a brand-new unit at full price, but I called both, got voicemail on both, and no reply yet on a Monday.
1,Very misleading. Even with the fertilizer and ample light the plants are very leggy and fall over. We never harvesting anything.
1,Should have chosen the one with atomic clock plus USB charging with $4 more!!
1,I have had 3 of these timers in the last 4 years. One lasted over a year, the next one less than a year and this last one lasted about 3 months. The problem is that the manual switch doesn't always activate the valve to allow manual watering. New batteries don't help. I even placed the thing under a plastic cover to protect it from the rain but that didn't work either. Maybe another model is better but I won't buy this one again.
1,I purchased this snow blower specifically to take care of removing snow for a large patio area. The blower started fine, but the key would pop out after several seconds and the blower would die out.  I viewed the starting operating procedure on both the Toro website and YouTube to make sure that I was following the proper start-up, but apparently the starter was defective, and the snow blower was returned to Amazon. Amazon was prompt, as always, with the return process. I didn't ask for a replacement because the blower was less substantial than I had hoped for based on the reviews. I did like that it was compact and lightweight, and if it had worked well, it would have been acceptable.
1,The main reason I gave only two,stars is because of Intex. They have zero customer service.  I tried contacting them in some way, filled out the form on their website several times before it would go through, and I did get an acknowledgement email saying they would get back to me.  Never happened. This is the second item I have questioned them about and got no response.  This skimmer is supposed to,work on the ring pools, has the correct attachment.  It will not stay level in the water and tries to float up, dumping it's contents.  The holes are too big in the basket to contain small particles (large ants) and they make it through and get trapped in the hose connector stopping the pump.
1,It did not work
1,It leaks. It is difficult to set the sprayer and after an hour of headache inducing stress I gave up. I was soaked, tired and very angry and went inside without adjusting the sprayer. The description was deceptive for the farthest reach of the couldn't have passed 24 feet.	Not a happy camper!
1,[Update: 5/21/16 - After putting the unit into storage for 2 years during a transitioning period, I pulled it out, replaced the batteries and it fired up immediately and began collecting data. It's connected to a Macbook Pro that is running OS 10.4.5 and I've had no problems. Connecting the AC power line to the desk console is still not possible due to interference but the 'C' batteries keep it humming. I am using WeatherTracker software which syncs nicely with the Vantage Vue console's output. The developer has worked hard to improve WeatherTracker's capabilities and interface. I'm also uploading data to Weather Underground where I've established a personal weather station. There are many options available for weather hobbyists these days and due to the many problems I had in the beginning, I still can't recommend the Davis Vantage Vue. But at least it earns an additional star for longevity.]		[Update: Davis' recommendation to unplug the AC and run the console on batteries worked. The data now flows smoothly from console to Mac software and my Wunderground site is updated at regular intervals of my choice. I installed ferrite cores on cabling and ran with AC plugged in but it made no difference--data stopped flowing from the console after a while. Too bad Davis won't fix this problem. But a company that sells woefully outdated software that any high school uber-geek could redesign in a week seems interested only in making money. On the other hand, Davis might still be in a pre-home computer mindset, where reading a console is all farmers need. I can't fathom why they are still messing with serial connectors, baud rates, clunky add-on units, and ugly software. They seem to be ignoring the weather hobbyist, which might very well be their biggest customer base. I still think the outdoor unit is a good one but I'm not changing my recommendation as it was such a hassle to get to the bottom of the connection problems. Plus, it diminishes the value of the console by being forced to run it on batteries only.]		(Original Review)	I bought a Davis Vantage Vue weather station and I think it is a great product. But if you want to connect it to a computer, this is where Davis stumbles badly. The Vantage Vue package consists of the outdoor weather station and an indoor wireless console that will record up to 8 months of data. But if you want to move that data or see it on a computer, then you have to buy the unit pictured here, the DataLogger, and plug it into the bottom of the console. It's a serial to USB unit. An included 8' USB cable extension runs to your computer. Along with the hardware, you get Davis' WeatherLink software on a CD. Install this software and you'll think you just took a time machine to 1990. It's hideous looking. And, the Mac version has limited capability.		So I began looking around the web for better software. I came up with 3 good choices. In no particular order, they are:	1)  WeatherTracker	2)  WeatherCat	3)  WeatherSnoop	Each has a trial version you can download. A couple of them have Windows and Mac versions and they are all about US$50-60. Depending upon your taste and what data you want displayed, you can't go wrong with any of these choices.		After trying out each of these, I noticed that data would simply stop uploading after a few hours. Unplugging, replugging the USB cable would remedy the problem, but who wants to hang around and do THAT all the time? One reviewer here said Davis claims the fault is "line interference" if one uses the included AC unit. I don't mind paying for batteries every 8 months so I will try to see if this claim is true. However, the developer of WeatherTracker has an excellent support page about connecting the Vantage Vue to a Mac: [...]	He believes it is a hardware problem and suggests some different serial to USB hardware solutions. Davis ported WeatherLink to the Mac but didn't include dependable USB drivers. The site above has a link to the latest driver available (from 2008 if you can believe that). I am not geek enough to try his suggestions, but you might be.		I am running Mac OS 10.9 Mavericks and the software runs fine and except for the occasional stoppages, the Davis stuff is OK. But having to pay an exorbitant price for the logger unit and 1990 software is unacceptable. I will update this review if I find a solution to the dropouts.		If you are a Mac user and you want to upload records to your computer as a hobby, or you simply want to monitor the day's or weeks's weather data, go ahead and get this as it will serve your needs. But if you want to upload to Weather Underground or another such site, or view your date over time, or build your own site, you'll need to buy 3rd party software and deal with the data dropout headache.		1 star -- not recommended
1,I order white and got green...I guess you pay for what you get...CHEAP
1,This pole trimmer is impossibly imbalanced.  Maybe that is inherent to all battery powered pole trimmers [maybe not] but this trimmer is extremely difficult to hold in position with your arms extended.  That makes the effective height for trimming much lower.  8 lbs may not sound like much but when you're holding it out 6' above your head it is  [I work out and lift weights].	Additionally it is underpowered- my B&D 24" handheld 36 Volt hedge trimmer is much more powerful.  Also it is very difficult to change the angle of the cutting head.  I would rather use my hand held B&D, even on a ladder.
1,never grew
1,Stopped working in less than a week, junk!
