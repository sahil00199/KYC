0,This drop clutch is just fantastic..  I have used them for years and always buy the same model.  Nothing on the market works as well as this.  Simple installation,  and it allows you to use your double bass pedals or double kick with a closed hi hat all from tapping it with your drumstick.. It couldn't be easier..  Best Buy on the Market.
0,Ok, I bought this guitar based on the very good reviews it received from others who purchased this. I  received it today tried it out. It's beautiful. I love the sleek design and you don't lose sound output acoustically even though it so much thinner. It's a lot easier on my back. I bought this guitar primarily for recording (in other words through my amp into my PC mixing software. But, I really like it as a standalone acoustic guitar as well.  I have 4 acoustic guitars and this quickly becoming my favorite. I appreciate other Amazon customers for reporting truthful reviews about products because they haven't been wrong yet.  The guitar is well made and the tuners are very nice and precise. It came with two pick-guards that you can choose from to remove the double stick cover and then stick it onto the guitar. One was all black and the other was woodtoned.  Ok, I just plugged it into my amp and recorded some test songs. Wow, sounds awesome. Like another review I read here---it does sound just as clean through the amp as it does acoustically. I can hardly wait to start recording with this guitar. It sure beats having to play in front of a microphone stand. This is my first Korean guitar and I really really like it!!!
0,Bought these at a discount price and was pleasantly surprised how well they matched Gibson pickups and vintage capacitors. I suspect they would sound good on many options*****! If still on sale they are a bargain. I am a penny pincher by necessity.
0,Great value!!
0,Good choice
0,Awesome!!!
0,These clamps are the absolute best out there.  They hold your mics perfectly using either the rims of the drums or the posts from the tom mounting brackets.  I have even hung one from a cymbal stand that was in the perfect position to mic a floor tom.		There are a lot of small parts that can go missing with these clamps so take care in making sure you keep the washers, otherwise you will not be able to position the mic clamps properly.  I just screw the all the way down to the base so they stay in place.
0,I'm a swiss army knife kinda guy, and I love multi-purpose tools. This one is great. Assist the twist, cut the extra wire, pull out the plug, its the best assistant for changing guitar strings I've had. Durable, solid steel/plastic construction. Fast and reliable shipping. No complaints from me!
0,This item is just perfect when you travel to perform.  I love it.
0,I now have 12 of these and they are great. Over $10 each at the local stores and they can't adjust for neck size as these do. I will continue buying these without a doubt.
0,This is a no-frills distortion pedal; I've used pedals that have a lot more options, but they're often obtuse.  For my 11 year old son's Telecaster (Squire - we're not insane) this was a great add on.  The body is reminiscent of bakelite - very retro and fun (for me).  For him, it makes his Tele scream and crunch. Tack on the old wah-wah, and he's off to Rage Against the Machine ...		I'm not sure it'd hold up to touring (?) but at this price point we could buy three effects compared to one at the big box music places.
0,The best playing guitar I've ever purchased and I didn't even get to try it out before hand
0,Good stand it is very sturdy, love the fact that it can be folded up for transport.  Does a great job with my Electric Guitar and Bass.  It's ok with my Fender Acoustic, it has be set on there just right otherwise it will fall.  For the price I think this was a good investment and it is virtually indestructible, that is unless my puppy chews on the part that hold the guitar... LOL
0,This has always been a great brand and has been my favorite since I started playing. Great quality of strings and sound great as well. Was very happy with how fast they came and they also came with 3 free picks so that was a nice surprise. Will be buying more.
0,I'm not a fan of high string tension, so if you like 9s on a 25.5" scale tuned to E standard, you'll probably like these on guitars with the shorter 24.75" scale length for E standard.
0,good
0,Nice firm fit.  Has not lost it's grip on me.  Doesn't knock guitar out of tune when applying or removing.  Might have been a nice feature to have it clip to the guitar in some way while not in use, but I can live with it.
0,Easy to do
0,Use it all the time, no issues.		Thanks!
0,so far it works great. No issues to report
0,Great for what it is intended to do, my PC recognizes it with no problems. The only gripe is the keys don't feel natural, or like a true semi-weighted feeling keyboard. But definitely a reasonable product for a budget minded home studio.
0,This is a surprisingly good strap for a very low cost. At this price point, I was able to buy several so I don't have to bother swapping straps out as I change instruments.
0,super
0,Guitar arrived in perfect condition. The Grover tuners are solid and smooth. This is a well made guitar. Love the sound.
0,Pretty good. Not the greatest cables in the world, but for a down-n-dirty quick option, they work pretty well.
0,what a great little gadget, fits my ukulele neck great ,and looks good to
0,Use it to hang tambourine and other assorted equip from the holder.  Seems to be strong enough to last,  So far, so good.
0,For several years (and several computers) I've been using an original Midiman Audio Buddy preamp and Roland USB audio interface for my computer recordings. The Audio Buddy is still a great preamp, but the Roland is a bit long in the tooth, and never delivered really great audio. It also had a number of annoyances, like bleeding the input audio to the output channel. I've been looking at audio/USB interfaces for a while and only recently noticed the Alesis MultiMix4. The company does have a great reputation, and I've owned Alesis mixers in the past. I was a bit concerned about the noise problem that some of the reviewers mentioned, but others said this could be overcome with proper settings. I also considered getting the cheaper&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Behringer-302USB-Premium-5-Input-Mixer-with-XENYX-Mic-Preamp-and-USB-Audio-Interface/dp/B005EHILV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Behringer 302USB Premium 5-Input Mixer with XENYX Mic Preamp and USB/Audio Interface</a>, but my experience has been that Alesis makes a far better quality product than Behringer that's well worth the small price difference. As a plus, the Alesis came with a good half-amp power supply, instead of trying to pull all the current it needs from the USB interface. That makes a big difference when you're dealing with high signal levels and driving a set of headphones at the same time.		My first impression on unpacking the MultiMix4 was that unit gave up nothing in terms of traditional Alesis solid construction. The steel case alone is, I think, worth the difference in price over the Behringer. Some reviewers have said that the knobs are flimsy, but as far as I can tell the same knobs I remember from the Alesis mixers I've owned. Hookup to my iMac was easy- the iMac immediately recognized the Alesis and assigned a standard USC CODEC that worked perfectly. I plugged in my Tele, fired up Garage Band, and laid down a few sample tracks. I didn't notice either the noise or the latency problems some reviewers had mentioned. I know there have been several software updates made since the MultiMix was introduced, so perhaps that was a factor. I haven't tried using it with my condenser microphones yet (a pair of  Samson CO2s and an Oktava Mk-319) but if I have any problems when I do try them I'll add an note to this review.		In short, this is a very useful, flexible, and relatively inexpensive USB audio interface that should be very useful for live recording, home multi tracking, and webcast production.
0,Nice and big!
0,Is great to have a cable without noise, with a clear sound transmission and a strong manufacturing. Thank you
0,I record musicians as a hobby, and these definitely work just fine. I have no problems with extra noise, the length is more than enough, and the fit of the ends are snug. Definitely recommend it for those who record as a hobby!
0,Good strings for the price, I use them consistently. I play acoustic bass a lot, and enjoy fresh strings. They may not be as bright as others, but they rock good enough for me. Great price too.
0,5stars because it's a practice pad and that's what you do with it.
0,Nice quality
0,Nice sounding slide. The wall is a little thinner, but it still has a great sound.	The inner dimensions run a little large. I would recommend getting a size smaller.
0,It makes it really easy to hold the pick ... even if my hands are dry.  You can swap out the pick for another one if you want a different gauge.  I sanded down the edge of the rubber ... I like it better that way.
0,These work great, super easy install on a 2000 Made in Mexico Standard, drop right in.		I marked one star off for this reason;  The listing does not specify if these are staggered height tuners or not.  Looking in the questions, there are people indicating that they are staggered going back years, so I assumed they must be staggered.  Well the set I received was definitely NOT staggered height, they are all identical height.		I don't know what the deal is there, I would have preferred staggered, as apparently most buyers have received.
0,Omg.... very very good. i'm singer.	So i have exprince studio recoding but my self.	So i worry about can i do it?	But now i can do it cubas7 and other progrem (oh, i need a 3hour for it. Im not expert!)	And after 3 hour i make first sound track!	I can do it so everybody can do it!		And sound qulity, oh.... its more then my expect!	I know big studio sound but still good!	this price and this qulity? Awsome!!!! Mic and headphone also good and prety!	Noise isolation perfect!		thank you. Good review that is very helpfull for me.		And i think i need headphone splitter.	Sometimes i play piano and other person singing.		I love this! Yeh!
0,Easy to use, Only rated 4 stars because I did have a faulty plug.  It came apart after a couple of week usage. Had to pull the plug  out after each use of the pedal board (would have worn down the battery of the box LED Otherwise). Eventually the tip came off (very bad - inside my AB Box..). Was able to remove the tip by reinserting the plug, and they gladly replaced my tip after showing them a picture of it. No other issues so far....
0,I was using a website to tune my guitar, and it was much more sensitive than this clip-on tuner (proguitartuner.com - you need a microphone to use it). But this works well when I don't have a computer handy. Just not quite sensitive enough for my taste!
0,A power tube died in my blues jr and subsequently also made my amp blow a fuse. Once I figured this out, i had to buy some new tubes, and sweet jesus jj delivers! My blues jr is by far my favorite amp, and it's back from the dead.		That said I don't know the tenure of these tubes so I'm hoping they last while, I got about 9 months on the groove tubes so hopefully these will outlast those. They sound more or less like the groove tubes, but I feel like they have slightly more bottom end and gain. I used to have to turn on the "fat" boost to get a good amount of gain from the amp but now with the volume set at 12 I'm pretty happy with it's gain level. The amp is the primary factor in tone, but these tubes get the job done and give the amp the necessarily means to do its job.		At any rate, I'd recommend these. They brought my amp back to life, which thoroughly pleased me, not to mention they sound great and I'm in hog heaven now that my amps back to working order.
0,My son is a Sax player and swears by the Vandoren reeds.  He uses a variety of different ones depending on his instrument, but always purchases the Vandoren brand.  He says they have the best sound, are most durable, and an affordable price.  We have looked at these reeds at many stores and distributors, but always end up purchasing from Amazon for the best price.  For any musician, these are the best product for the money!
0,When you consider the cost of plugs and cable, buying these short lengths is actually cheaper than making my own.  Good value!
0,I don't own the One Spot power supply, but needed a converter that would turn a 9 volt adapter I have into something I could directly attach to an exercise bike that uses a 9 volt battery to initialize its console before the alternator/main battery takes over. However, the descriptions for the adapter and this converter never stated the size of the plug. So for $3 I took a chance and ordered one. After trying a few that seemed to fit, the one that works is a size "M" on my Radio Shack adaptaplug adapter. I tested the voltage and polarity and it matched that of the 9 volt battery so when I connected the converter to the bike it would appear to be just another battery.		I would have used a Radio Shack Adaptaplug, but couldn't find anything listed on the Radio Shack Website. Must be a specialty type item that might have been discontinued. Should have bought one when I originally purchased the variable voltage 3-12 volt adapter from them years ago.
0,The sound quality of the recording is wonderful. I also like that I can use it with an AAA battery, so I do not have to worry about charging at all.	 I wish the instruction is clearer.
0,One of the best drum machines second to their akai mpc renaissance. Definitely worth the money.
0,I use this for dual condensers (not stereo, as such) for recording acoustic guitar and ukes.
0,great the screwholes did not match, but no big deal yes i would buy again
0,These strings are AWESOME! I loved the way they sounded (on a BC Rich Exclusive...looks like a PRS-style guitar). So full, so rich, so nice! Will definitely buy again. -=80)
0,I ordered this item with fingers crossed that I could get into computer-based music recording without spending a fortune.  I have an older Korg SP-100 keyboard and used this cable to connect it to my computer which runs Tracktion 3 recording software.  Having installed the software and some VST plugins for instrument sounds, and having connected my keyboard via this usb/midi cable and done a few rounds of simple recording to test the setup, I am happy to report that everything seems to be working well.  I can't really comment on the quality or longevity of the cable since I've only had it a short while, but at less than $10 my expectations won't be hard to exceed.  If you need a simple & cheap way to use a midi controller with your computer, this seems like a great way to go.  And for the record, my computer runs Vista Home Premium and there have been no compatibility or driver issues.
0,This guitar had surprisingly good fit and finish and great sound for a 3/4. I got this because I wanted a backpacking guitar so I went to a music store to compare the different travel size guitars. The martin backpacker was terrible. Badly done fretboard, terrible sound, and awkward to play. This is perfectly comfortable because it's still a dreadnaught shape and the fretboard was just as nice as a 329 dollar Taylor 3/4 guitar.
0,Wow! I ignored the bad reviews. This is a meticulously crafted product. I used an emeryboard (fingernail sander) a little on the Squire Body and it fit right in and plays perfectly. The finish is fairly dark and is glossy. Frets could not be better!
0,good product
0,thank you
0,Man, Chinese electronics sometimes blow my mind with what they deliver at their price point.  This isn't the best mic (or stand, or phantom power box), but it works shockingly well for its price.  I highly doubt one will find a better home studio mic below the $150-or-so price point.  Though slightly more expensive brand-name ones may have a little nicer build quality, but I think this is worth every penny for someone using it in a more or less fixed location without abuse (if you have a working recording studio, I expect you know what you're doing and won't need this review).		Ok for demo vocals, should be ideal for podcasters or home voice-over work.
0,I needed these to fit the holes already in a used Carvin neck I bought, they fit right in.  Hold tune very well, lock works very well, they are well made and look great.  What else is there?  Could be cheaper, but I like them.
0,Much higher build quality than I expected for the price. Bought it for my Casiotone 601 that I keep plugged in at my rehearsal space for whatever key player happens to drop by.  Didn't want to spend much as I'm certainly not a keyboard player by trade.  Very pleasantly surprised, great weight and action, functions flawlessly. Turns out its the same one that my real keyboard player friend uses heavily, and his has held up great as well.
0,The last. They sound good. I don't like changing strings on guitars all the time. I have lots of guitars and kids who play etc... these are very good quality, hold their sparkle and satisfy.. whats not to like?
0,I love these strings, they seem just right. I like the feel of the 3rd wound string. I buy these for both of my electric guitars.
0,Beautiful chorus effect with my Ibanez Artcore.
0,Great! And good price.
0,These Fender knobs are far superior to some knockoffs on the market. I have purchased "other" knobs in the past that were slightly smaller and shorter than the genuine article, and have much less pronounced knurling. If you have a Fender, these are the only knobs you should consider.		Note that the Fender knobs will fit pots with 0.25" shafts only. If your pots have 6mm shafts these will not fit.
0,I love the EJ32s for their black nylon trebles, silver-wound bases, and ball ends.  The ball ends make restringing a breeze, and they tidy up the appearance of a tied bridge.  The strings sound good, and they last a long time.
0,this cables are great. Thak you.
0,As Advertised,Fast Delivery,No Problems
0,seasoned professional guitarist says "sweet! red color is subtle and cool. kyser is an excellent brand of capo. I highly recommend."
0,I absolutely love these things.  They make quick work setting up and tearing down your cymbals, especially after your gig is done and you just want to get paid and go home.  Buy 'em, you will not regret it.
0,excellent  did just what I wanted it to do
0,Is a Seymour Duncan..... good sound, no problem
0,Great little bottle of fret dressing. Much better that buying a big bottle of lemon furniture oil, thicker too. Nifty little built-in applicator. Use every time you change strings, you won't be disappointed.
0,Very quality, super stable!
0,Awesome tuner!!
0,Great product for a great price. Not fancy - but nothing fancy was needed.
0,I owned this pedal for about a year. As far as Klon clones go, it was my favorite. I owned/borrowed a few different ones, including the EHX Soul Food, the Tone Bakery Creme Brulee, and the Pedal Monster. Of what I got to try out, the Archer iKon was the best. I've never played through a real Klon, though, so I can't compare to the original. But I can say that if you want a good germanium boost with the ability to add some nice fuzzy wool saturation, this one will do it. And the aesthetics can't be beat. I did eventually give it up when I moved over to preferring Blues Breaker clones such as Analog. Man's Prince of Tone and Mooer's Blues Crab. But if Klon tone is what you want, pick up this one.
0,I had been looking to buy a full sized violin, at a reasonable price in an attempt to re-learn what I gave up after two years of pretending to be a violin player.  The price of this item was worth the gamble.		  What a surprise!  I may never try to give a concert, but I can't wait for the spare time to drill for a couple of hours with this outstanding, for my purposes, buy of a lifetime.  I can hit the notes accurately for my ear, read the music, play tunes I've only heard, using a product that I'm proud that I took a shot at. I was even able to carefully follow the distributor's on-line instructions and with encouragement from a young grandson, set up the instrument for playing with no professional help.  That, I may seek from a willing teacher in the near future.		  It may be overblown sentiment but it is a thrill just to open the case and after briefly checking the tuning, accomplish something I get a kick out of doing.
0,Nice feel...
0,Great
0,Dude, they're picks.
0,The headband problem has been resolved! We have a new Incrediflex Headband. The new headband is incredibly flexible, durable and rugged.  It also has "memory" that allows the headband to be stretched or squeezed to fit the personal comfort requirement of the user.  There is nothing like it in the industry.		See the video demonstrating the INCREDIFLEX headband being flattened, bent and abused well beyond normal expected use without breaking. The headband can be replaced in literally seconds with no tools whatsoever.		[...]
0,I still think my perfect pick is out there, waiting to be discovered by me. But from the 22 types of picks in my collection, this is the best of all!. Great for any kind of rhythmic madness or shredding that you may try to peform.
0,I am a beginner clarinet player and these reeds work great for me. I don't really know what I'm looking for, but I haven't had any problems with these.
0,I am thrilled with this cleanly designed, white 49-key keyboard!  It's just so simple and user-friendly for this beginning player, and my iPad Mini 2 fits securely into the slot, with all the iPad Mini's controls easily accessible.  (I put it in horizontally/landscape-wise with the home button on the right side.)  To my surprise, my iPhone 6 also hooked up perfectly.  I had tried the more expensive keyboards -- including Yamaha and Casio, with built-in speakers -- but as a space-challenged apartment dweller, I prefer this unit that fits comfortably on my lap (and has no built-in accompaniments or songs like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, etc.).  Though it comes with its own software, I just plugged my keyboard into my iPad Mini (with Apple's Lightning to USB Camera Adapter) and had no trouble getting Garage Band to recognize it.  Yes, the keys do make a very audible clicking sound, but this is far less noticeable when you're wearing headphones, and the clicks won't be captured when you record directly into whatever program you're using.  And, oh yeah, the piano sounds fantastic (plus the strings are a standout, too), and while the keys feel just a bit like those on a budget organ, they're piano-like enough for me.
0,helps a lot
0,perfect size and the sound quality is awesome. was very easy to hook up and made my mixing much easier to do. i did not know how much i was missing only using headphones. for now on monitor speakers all the way.
0,I think the sound is good. It is my first Uke.
0,Got it to work after a lot of messing around the manual was not user friendly. Once I got going works great
0,Well made, quality bag!
0,Very nice!
0,Life before Lava: I was always chasing down an intermittent signal dropout, ground buzz, or overall noise floor. I had a mix of patch cables from various sources that all checked fine on a cable tester.		Life with Lava Tightrope: so far, 0 failures, 0 ground loops/buzz/hum, and a VERY LOW noise floor.		I didn't really buy into the hype before, preferring to spend dollars on the pedals instead. I'm now a believer; every component matters, and not all cables are created equal.		These were trivially easy to put together after I watched the tutorial on YT. It all worked on the first attempt.
0,I ordered the first set of these straploks because I was using an older leather strap that had sentimental value but questionable post holes.  These things work so well and lock in so solidly that I now put a set on all my new instruments before I sling them over my shoulder.  I prefer the Dunlop push-button approach to the Schaeller pull-pin design.  And the fact that the strap rides above the post allows me to loop the guitar cord over the endpin without anything binding or rubbing against the guitar finish.  Highly recommended!
0,I have 2 other cheaper wall mounts for my budget guitars, however when it came to my 12 string I wanted to make sure that it could be shown off on the wall but protected from accidental bumps that could knock the guitar down. The beauty of this wall mount is in the "flippers" at the end of it. When downward pressure is applied (i.e. the weight of the guitar), the flippers move inwards 90 degrees to lock the guitar in place. To remove the guitar, simply lift upward, then pull toward you as the flippers go back down.		While the mount itself is large, it does its job well - all sides where the guitar is touching are padded, and the mount is extremely sturdy and trustworthy.
0,Great little keyboard controller, works great with garage band or pro tools.  A bit small for my hands, but that's the point.  Surprisingly nice feel for the raised button style keys. Nothing to put together, no external power source needed, simple software installs itself.  For 50 bucks a fantastic buy.
0,I'm using this for recording my PRS Angelus Custom SE using it's built in electronics.		The main advantage is that I can now turn up my monitor amplifier without degrading the sounds I am recording!		The photo doesn't do this justice ... it is a very heavy duty (much heavier than shown) rubber stopper for the sound hole on your guitar.		It eliminates sounds from entering the guitar via your sound hole and there by reducing feedback, especially when you are amplifying your guitar to high sound levels.
0,Nice pick, easy to hold, great sound
0,I'm really happy with this pedal.  I wanted something that simulated a real piano pedal rather than just a device that moves up and down.  This feels real, and works great.  I haven't had any problems with it, so I have no more to say but get it if you want a pedal for your keyboard!
0,I purchased 2 of these mics and they are just the best in my opinion and the members of my band.
0,i tried these after reading the reviews.  I really like them. They sound great, and look shinny and coppery and beautiful.  I never realized how strings can add that extra somthing to the sound of your guitar .  I put them on an epiphone aj-100 with tusq nut and saddle. Sounds awsome.
0,Excellent strings, by far my favorite strings
0,This is one of my best straps which isn't saying a whole lot, but for what I payed it's works incredibly well
0,The item is more than i expected and my child loves it.  You can do so many things with the item and you can learn how to play with the tutorials.
0,I guess I am a bit of a snob in that some of the boutique pedals have a WAY nicer foot switch that is like butter... This one is not... but works fine and the delay has good range and nice/useable adjustments.
0,All I can say is,,, You should try a set of these Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings for yourself. You will not want to go back to any other set of strings. I've been using Elixir strings for many years. They have better feel, sound, and last longer than all other brands I've used playing Guitar. Elixir has excellent quality control too. I've never had a problem.
0,It's what I wanted. My old bass case is so large and heavy, and was so stiff it can stand up on its own and had wheels. I wanted a lightweight bass case that I could carry. I like how slim and compact this one is. It barely fits my bass though, it's a snug fit on my 3/4 size Calin Wultur Panormo bass. The snug fit is probably a good thing for transportation.  When I go to orchestra, I often don't have a lot of elbow room for a huge padded case. This one has very thin padding (1/2" or so) and it collapses flat on the ground. The pockets aren't huge, but a bow and some sheet music do fit. I registered for the 5 year warranty, since I don't know how long the zippers and stitching will last. But so far, I like the simplicity and minimalist case better than my old monster bass case with wheels. I included a picture comparing the two cases.
0,love it!!!
0,Same great quality pack after pack! I love these strings for all three of my accoustic guitars, as they allow your fingers to glide over the frets, without drag from a rough surface. These strings seem smoother than martin or deAdario strings, and they take longer to discolor and fail to hold tune.
0,Helped sound absorption in my shed as that is what I use to record music. Quality pads and they give you a bang for your buck.
0,WOW super comfortable to play. Goes from sweet and innocent to raunchy and vicious with the turn of a knob. Very sensitive to volume and tone knob changes. Finish is superb, grain is beautiful, very light. It just does not get any better for the price! My second vintage modified model and third Squire and will surely continue buying more!
0,Great price for a pair of XLR cables. These get pretty light use so should last forever.
0,Great Strings.  I only use elixir strings on my 12 string and i am never disappointed.  Great sound and long life.
0,I needed a cable and decided to go with this one. I was impressed with the price, and was pleased to receive the free picks. The delivery was prompt and it was packaged nicely. Oh, and the cable works well. I'm happy with my purchase.
0,[...]	Excellent speakers for a great price best bang for your buck for studio reference monitors or for just enjoying music. I honestly believe JBL put the very best they had science wise into these speakers I couldn't be happier
0,This music stand was sturdy, substantial, and reliable.  Great deal for the money for sure!  Would buy again and recommend to friends.
0,I bought Elixer strings before these and noticed a way better sound quality. These strings are great. Wat can I say? Buy them!
0,This is high quality material. It is flawless at the lowest price I could find for any blank.
0,Great quality!
0,I didn't know about the single string packs, I thought I would have to buy singles. I like a heavier 1st string for harmonics. This is a great value and I am think about experimenting with getting all single string packs to suit my tastes. D'darrio strings have a favorite of mine for decades. The sound is dead on great and the sustain is awesome. P.S. If you have a habit of breaking certain strings during a self indulgent bombastic solo trance the single string packs are a great back-up!
0,works great with no string buzz
0,buenisimas
0,These are also available in red.  Avoid the red one's, because unlike these, the red one's do not have a texture to keep them from slipping out of your grip.  These are also available as "regular" size and not XL series.  These XL series are the size of a typical pick.  The non XL series are TINY!  Avoid them. (they're great quality picks, just too small)  If you play metal, rock, blues, jazz, and need new picks, go with Dunlop Jazz III XL Stiffo Guitar Picks 6-pack.  Make sure they're black, and XL!
0,Bought this pedalboard for a couple reasons...		1) Having the built-in power conditioner eliminates the unwanted noise you get from 'power strips'.	2) Being able to power most of my pedals with the provided power cables eliminates the dreaded wall warts!	3) Having a large velcro surface was important to me!  I don't use a ton of pedals, but I use enough that it won't fit on a lot of the smaller boards.	4) I know that my pedals are protected from damage with the hard shell case!		Some improvements to think about!		This board is almost identical to the Furman SPB-8C Stereo Pedalboard (which is no longer available new).  What I liked about the Furman was that it had a pull up handle and wheels.	I wonder why SKB didn't include this in the PS45?		Overall, I love my PS45 pedalboard!  I hope to get many years of use out of it!!!
0,very good sound for the size and price.	no where close to the JBL LSR305 's	but still good
0,Really useful, easy to use, very well designed.  Well worth the somewhat higher than average cost.  It's great to see all the tunings at once by strumming one time across the strings  You can quickly tweak one or two strings that may have drifted.  Pluck just one string and it displays a very clear, accurate tuner for that one string.	The display is so much quicker to use than the round-dial Snark-style tuners, and the "all strings" display let's you quickly check to see if you are done.  And I keep it in its box - that is well though out too, needing just a press in the finger hole to slide the tune out.  Love it!
0,Great Pedal love the sound! Does sound like a Fender Twin some what.  You can dial in sort of an Eagles Lead sound. Sounds great with my USA Tele and tube amp!
0,I love the sound of these--they're a very nice, bright set, comparing very favorably to other 12's, which can sound a bit dull because of the heavy gauge.  They're not tinny at all though--the low tones come right through.  They last about a month with regular play, so you will have to change them regularly, but I couldn't get the tone with coated strings.
0,A fantastic instrument! It's handmade and it has a really good sound. Great sustain from the goatskin head. It being tuneable is a plus. I use it all the time along with my other world instruments in my studio sessions. Love it!
0,My ovation preamp went out ..It would cost more than a new guitar to put an original preamp in but I loved the guitar...I found this and it is fantastic..and great price.
0,perfect!
0,Very good!
0,I have used these for a long time, They are great. These were actually a gift but I know he is happy with them Delivery was as promised
0,Love, love, love this little amp.	Im not some 'golden eared" pro, or audiophile, by any means, and I am just starting out with electric guitar (telecaster) but this amp sounds great!	My brother, who has played since he was a kid gives it rave reviews as well. (Tells me he's "jelly" and wants one, too)		SO happy I chose this Super Champ for my first amp.		-Quality and worksmanship is what I  would call "really good" for being made in Mexico. They look like they take a bit of pride in making them.	-Knobs/Switches/Buttons all solid	-Cabinet well made and solid. Wrap firmly adhered with no peeling or weak spots.	-USB interface from back to PC (Havent played with this yet, but, look forward to doing so. Free audio software from Fender site allows effects adjustments, EQ, etc......all downloadable into the amp)	-Input for A/B switch, etc on back.	-Great choices for 'voices' and 'effects' (with "F/X adjust, which controls the gain of the effect....)		All-in-all for me, the new player, it has MORE than enough for my level of ability.	For those more seasoned, I would think this little 'hybrid' amp has enough versatility and great sounds that it could easily find a nice home among much more expensive rigs in the studio.		I could highly recommend this Super Champ X2 to anyone thinking about purchasing one.
0,Looks nice. Fit well, barely had to file it to match. Slight improvement in clarity and the strings don't bind as much when tuning a new set of strings.
0,Slick little device for capoing.  Does not get in the way of your fingers.  I use it for concert uke.  Price is very modest - a good overall buy.
0,Excellent!
0,The touch sensing is not as sensitive as the Axiom Pro but they cost a lot less. As far as ease of use when transposing or changing octave ranges these things work great in a live environment and studio. Very light weight which to me is a plus since I use them live. If you connect two at a time in Pro Tools (MP8) it will has trouble  figuring out which one to talk too. But it does work well with one KS 61 and an Axiom pro controller together in PT.
0,15 is so many piezo discs! I used about 4 to add some acoustic tones to a Strat and they worked well. Now what do I do with the other 11? More guitar projects!
0,i really like these strings, because they are both inexpensive and quality.  i love elixir, but they are too expensive when i keep breaking strings all the time
0,Crazy simple idea but it has made changing strings on any of my guitars so much easier than it once was.
0,must have
0,Ebows used to be grey. now they are black.	If you use an ebow, you know its value. enough said.		*one piece of advice: Lithium Duracell 9-volts do not fit!
0,Great deal, excellent product
0,what a bundle, everything you need in one package, I mean everything. if you buy any other product, you'll be cheating yourself. the highest quality I've seen, for the price. not a toy, I've  been standing in front of it, waiting for it to fix my breakfast,  kind of getting hungry, but I am not giving up, lol.!.
0,Cloth covered cables look and feel better than plastic coated ones.  Plus they are silent on the floor.  Remember than when you are recording or need to have total silence.
0,My granddaughter has a new pink guitar and now she has matching picks in her favorite color as well. They are perfect for her.
0,I use these with JBL LSR308 Monitors while atop speaker stands and it makes a big difference.		To test this out, put your studio monitors on a desk and play a song.	While playing, feel the vibrations on that desk. Those vibrations cause the bass of that song to sound lousy because	those lows aren't being absorbed to provide a warm smooth humming bass.		In combination with this, acoustically treat your room with bass traps and studio foam , especially directly behind your studio monitors to really appreciate the expensive monitors you have.
0,Great strings to my liking. I put mine on my L-5 and they are just right. Bright, but not overly. Very nice feel for jazz playing.
0,this thing is so versatile. I have a pearl 7 piece kit on a pearl rack with 10 cymbals. I don't own a cymbal stand besides my no leg hi hat (Gibraltar). I got this to connect one end to the no leg hi hat stand and the other to one a cymbal arm to stabilize the hi hat. It can go up Down and all around. 360 degrees of easy adjustments  Plus it extends even longer if you need it to. It's one of the pricier pieces from Gibraltar. But it was totally worth it. Cheers.
0,Works well, as advertized.
0,Love these strings. Unbeatable price
0,I had just paid $34 for this cable at a Guitar Center when I saw this on Amazon.  It's a very nice cable and I love the cable tie feature you can use to coil up the cable.
0,A little hard to figure out as there are so many options available. But a good tuner and serves it's purpose! Would recommend!
0,A handy thing to have around the studio
0,By far the best amp that I have found anywhere near this price range! In addition to different effects and amplifier simulation settings it has 12 presets that you can save and customize. It also has a Bass setting that turns your 6 string guitar into a bass guitar. It has a USB out so you can also connect it to your PC with included software and modify and record yourself!		If you also get the Sanpera foot switch it unlocks the looping feature as well as allows you to switch between the presets super easy! This amp gets VERY loud for such a small amp! I have not had it above 5-6 and even then it was shaking the windows in my room!
0,Very good instrument for my daughter to learn on.
0,I'm very happy with this pedal.  I mainly bought it to use directly into the PA system at band rehearsals.  It sounds very good going directly into the PA.  It can get a little noisy when the gain and voice are turned up all the way, but this isn't any different from an amp with the gain turned up high.		I really like the sound of this pedal.  It's feels like a pre-amp in a pedal.  The EQ knobs make a huge difference in the sound of the pedal.  It's easy to dial in great sounds with the level/voice/gain knobs.  The sound through our PA is very good.  It sounds even better through the clean channel of my practice amp (Bugera V22).  I put this at the end of my pedal chain and it seems to play very nicely with my other pedals: Blues Driver, Joyo Chorus, Joyo Delay, Cry Baby.  It's very easy to get a Hendrix sound with this pedal and the Cry Baby :)		I'm surprised by the quality of the pedal build.  It has a very sturdy metal enclosure that seems very solid.  The knobs all rotate easily but have a little resistance so they aren't accidentally changed.  I like to Velcro my pedals to my board but this pedal has a rubber back.  The Velcro tape doesn't stick to the rubber very well.  It will hold for a while, but any time the pedal is removed from the board, the Velcro peals off the pedal.
0,Good product and price.  Large enough to to a lot of covers.  Easy to cut and shape.  I do recommend...
0,So far so good. Cables seem to be pretty resilient, but I bought them to use in a static setup, and I can't yet attest to their long term durability and/or use in a situation where you'd be constantly plugging, unplugging and rolling them.
0,My favorite type of acoustic strings.
0,Very sturdy stand. I have two and plan to grab at least two more. Highly recommended.
0,Just acquired my first Taylor acoustic guitar which came with the cool Taylor Deluxe Gig Bag but no strap.  So, I found this deal on Amazon and decided to get a matching (almost) strap.  Now my Taylor acoustic rig is complete...
0,Outstanding! Great clarity and performance, went and ordered another one.
0,good product
0,Nice but the foot pads keep falling off.
0,ok.
0,Great stand. Looks good and is sturdy.
0,I've levelled frets on my guitars and friends guitars for many years. I was taught the way of the old, a mill file attached to a wooden handle. After seeing so many people starting to use sanding beams, it started to make sense to me.	I had a guitar waiting for this beam to come in the mail. I knew I didn't need to take a lot of material of these frets, so I didn't want to reach for my file.	This beam did exactly what I needed it to! It was very easy to control and I only used the weight of the beam while leveling.	I will be grabbing this before my file as my go-to for most jobs now. I'll save the file for the real heavy work.
0,I purchased this reverb tank as a replacement for the stock Vox AC15 tank. This reverb tank is a much better improvement over the stock tank. This tank features more ofa medium decay which I prefer. This tan makes the amps reverb actually usable. I have put away a few reverb pedals since installing this. Very impressed
0,I use this to quick detach a mic boom from my desk.		Mine arrived slightly damaged, the metal sheath is slightly bent. This did not affect the function of product so I decided to ignore it.		Only thing that I can see as a possible problem for others using it in a live on stage situation is there isn't anything other than gravity holding the two pieces together. I was thinking it was a button quick release, but it didn't affect me the way I use it.		I'll likely be buying more of these
0,Good quality bag for my Epi LP. Fit like a glove, in fact I wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories.
0,Good. Not perfect but works fine.
0,I had been using the green tortex picks, and tried this just for the heck of it.  The pics are smaller than what I am used to, but it was an easy transition.  I like the more pointed profile better than the tortex ones, and the thickness is good.  Makes for a great pick when trying to do fast runs and feel like it is more efficient whether alternate picking, sweeps, etc. The little raised areas give the pick an excellent grip initially.  After awhile, it can get gummed up with oils, skin etc, and need to take a stiff toothbrush to them. Not a big deal.  The point hasn't shown any wear during my use of them. I really like them.. bye bye tortex and the black ink all over ones hands too.  I wish these came in other colors though, it is real easy to misplace the pick due to it's color.  It also doesn't slide nicely in-between strings due to the raised grip sipings or whatever they are called.  Try em, you might like em.  I an ordering another set of 6.
0,good.
0,I am very pleased with these guitar strings and would recommend to any one that I know.  Thank You very much
0,Purchased to mix mic and digital piano for recording on a PC using USB input. The basics are there and it seems to work fairly well. There is some hiss on the mic channel, but I'm using a dynamic mic through the 3.5mm input instead of using a professional mic through the regular mic input, so that might be an issue. Also, there is no way to mute the mic, even turning both gain controls down to zero still allows the mic to be heard. I have to mute the mic on the mic itself, which results in a popping sound (again, maybe because it's a cheap mic). The 2nd channel input is very quiet and fidelity sounds good. Having to switch the playback between the USB and inputs is a bit of a pain, but I understand why they did that. Overall, a decent, but not exceptional mixer with USB input/output.
0,I have a 9 string Alverez (basically a 12 string) that I have had for years and never had a pickup on it. I wanted to give this one a try. It sounds great! I'm blown away at the quality for the cost. It really moves the exact sound of the guitar to the amp. Love it.
0,Great purchase.
0,This is a great upgrade for anyone with a non-USA Stratocaster. My MIM Strat just never had the sparkle that should even after a pickup upgrade. This kit fixed that and I now have all the bell like sparkle I'd been missing before. You do have to get new knobs though because the CTS pots have a larger shaft than Alfa pots. I ordered this kit because it has all of the best components and for a price that is better than the Stew Mac kit. It even had the value of orange drop cap that I wanted (.022). The vintage push back wire is so much easier to work with than modern cheep wire found on most new guitars. There's plenty of wire to do the job.  Wiring this kit was easy. The wiring diagram that is included is the typical Stratocaster schematic and will work fine. However Fender has ground loops in the original wiring that contribute to 60 cycle hum and other noise. To cure that I recommend using the wiring scheme found at [...]. It's a better way to wire it up.	The seller was great and I had the kit in just 3 days after ordering. This is best and cheapest upgrade I've ever made to a guitar. I highly recommend it.

(SEE VIDEO FOR SOUND EXAMPLES)		NOTE :: 1st half is a Nikon D5300 BUILT-IN Mic, 2nd half is the ZOOM.  You can hear the irritating Auto-focus noise w/Built-In :(		RESULTS :: Captures Audio very well, if you use even earbuds as a monitor, it shocks you how much detail the Stereo Mics on the unit actually pick up.  During a Car Show I was able to pickup "Everything" including idle chatter, birds in the distance, loud resonating bass from big block muscle cars...even to the point of being more sensitive then my own ears.		CONCERNS :: My MAIN complaint is a specific minor issue.  When you use it as a line-in 'ripper' the highs are washed out and the lows lack 50% or more of the frequencies below 250Hz.  In other words using this as an mp3 ripper is less then ideal.  I am sure I could get good results, but not without disabling every sound feature on my SoundBlaster ZX Card AND setting all EQ's to flat or disabled.  NOTE:: When ripping the aforementioned steps are standard, you just need to put in extra time to rip with an H1 due to clarity, high end noise & the low end -db cut.		FINAL OPINION :: Fantastic device, super easy to use & very suitable for post-production audio syncing.  I don't use the line-in as a ripper, but that's completely overshadowed by the units functionality.  If you need a great easy to use recording device for car shows, beach events or other busy convention-like activity the Zoom H1 Handy is the BEST vs. COST.  It functions perfectly as a personal recorder and for interviews.  The buttons function perfectly for me, with my only real complaint being the plastic case feels cheap & the SD Card slot & battery covers are too delicate.  (Although after 6 months, I have not damaged mine...yet.)		::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::	UPDATES :: Make sure you download the firmware update = fixes the battery drain issue.  My batteries last for MONTHS sitting in my H1 and I use Rechargeable Duracell NiMH cells.  Get a FUZZY windscreen, handle (for personal recordings) & vibration isolation cage.  I bought this set&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Movo-AEK-Z1-Accessory-Kit-for-the-Zoom-H1-Handy-Recorder-Includes-Shockmount-Camera-Shoe-Furry-Windsceeen-Hand-Grip/dp/B0184O5P6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Movo AEK-Z1 Accessory Kit for the Zoom H1 Handy Recorder (Includes Shockmount, Camera Shoe, Furry Windsceeen & Hand Grip)</a>&nbsp;it's much better then the Zoom versions (sadly).  If you're not sure about this device let me say "It's a critical upgrade when compared to any built-in DSLR Mic hands down!"  Just wish they sold an aluminum version with weatherproof rubberized sd card doors & battery cover, I would buy it even at $200.  The larger Zoom mics are much better, but for me SIZE, WEIGHT & EASE of USE are more critical to me when used for events/shows/conventions/etc.  Multi-track recorders have the edge, but the H1 gets the job done for me at a fraction of the cost & clutter.	::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
0,I never had the opportunity to play with this picks before, I ordered a 12 pack in blue color.		The order arrived perfectly, you will receive a small plastic bag sealed with a carton paper on top, stapled into the bag.		Once you remove the paper (with an advert for Fender Strings inside), you will notice the bag has a system similar to a plastic zip bag.		The picks itself are truly awesome, I play mostly Blues and by far, this is the best pick hands down, celluloid feels great when playing and the pick itself is hard, does not bend, which I like. When playing, this really defines your style, it is a strange sensation since I feel I played differently influenced by the pick.		Overall, I feel that this  pick is the perfect companion for a Fender guitar, the only downside that I would give 4 stars is the fact that these are Made in China. These should be US made.
0,Perfect replacement for my Fender Hotrod Deluxe III Tube Amp.
0,Fits perfectly. It is a nice stretchy cover that protects the keyboard. It was not stretched too far or too loose. The cables in the back are also not in the way. I didn't use the draw string, but it would keep it in place better. The string wasn't needed unless I wanted a tighter fit.
0,My favorite pick
0,favorite windscreen for an sm57
0,This thing made me a true believe in Buffer pedals. I don't have many pedals in my chain (only 4) but the difference is quite noticable. It brings back the top-end, makes the low-end more defined, and makes the pick attack more sensitive. It will never leave my board.
0,I use with the Chauvet Hurricane 1301 fog machine. It plugs in, sticks with a magnetic back and works great. I used it at 50' with no problem.	So much nicer than a cable. Good product.
0,Glad to have this when I need it. This is a simple rubber sound hole cover that fits my acoustic guitar perfectly. I've only tried it out once to dampen out feedback caused by my guitar vibrating while its amped up. It did the tricking worked as advertised. It bought this cover as an 'emergency" item for when I play through an amp or PA system and I need to turn up the volume. Since I don't play in amplified sessions very often, I have it just in case.
0,Not yet used but appears to be standard fender quality
0,The strings definitely have a good tone, though I've got them on a low-end mandolin. They may be more than the mando needs. But they sound great!
0,great, unless its for a band with a drummer, or even a lot of mics. I just use it for TV. top grade, better than the ones I use at work, except for bands,  but if you have a band, you run out of channels.
0,Works great for cigar box guitars and ukuleles
0,Product as described - Thank you
0,A little too floppy for me.  But really great product.
0,All I can say is...WOW! This pedal is exactly what I have been looking for. I have a Fender tube amp and usually have to crank it pretty loud to get the dirt I like. This pedal pushes my amp to that sound at lower volumes and really fattens up the tone. I no longer need my overdrive pedal. This will be an always on pedal.
0,they work great
0,Great mixer for podcasting and Logic Pro workflow. The FX is one of the best that I have used in a long time.
0,I'm 5'5", 155 pounds. I find I can play and I do not notice the seat, which is good. By back, bum, shoulders, etc do not hurt (I use good posture). My feet are on the floor and I can use my foot petal without thought, easy ergonomics. Stool slides under the piano.
0,Works well.
0,Awesome, very low profile and the price is great. They are the same profile and dimentio s as StewMacs low profile rod and half the price.
0,This is just one step below professional Shure microphones but great maybe for karoke and small family gatherings where sound quality doesn't matter as long as your voice amplifies. This does a pretty good job on amplifying and convenient price.
0,Not bad at all for the price you pay. It is a great guitar for beginners. It is a full size guitar. It came with a shoulder strap, a carrying bag, a pic and an extra set of strings. I would recommend changing the strings to better ones. It is a tunable, playable guitar. Overall it is good.
0,Great, durable product!
0,After using the Dava Jazz grip pick I'll never use anything else.  At first I thought the pick may be too small....now I consider it the only size I like. In fact I always keep one in my pocket....always!		  First of all the grip....this pick stays right where you want it....I can play for hours and it does not slip....everything about it is perfect.  If you love playing guitar you need to try this pick....in my opinion its the best pick ever....period!		Try it....I guarantee you will never want to use anything but the Dava Jazz Grip pick.
0,Got a great Prime Day deal on this one.  It's okay-ish.		It sounds strong, but has an overall cheap feel to it, like it may break.  It is uninspiring.		Out of the box the strings are a full 1/8" above the frets.  Going to need some work before it is playable.  Saddle adjustments are fairly easy on an electric, but it's a bit of a job on an acoustic.		Also, it arrived with a small dent in the top.  Not a deal breaker, since I got a deep discount on this guitar.		I would definitely not pay full price for this instrument.  It isn't worth it.		UPDATE:  The low-E bridge pin is stuck in the bridge.  I discovered this when I attempted to make the necessary saddle adjustments and change the strings.  With gentle effort (I've done this numerous times on other guitars) the top of the bridge pin broke off.  Unable to dislodge it from inside the sound hole.  Amazon is sending a replacement.		UPDATE:  I received my replacement today.  It sounds ok, but the action is 12/64"!  about double what it should be, and double what the "QC" tag stated.  Be ready to spend more money on a setup, or spend all weekend working on it.  Still, 2 stars.		UPDATE:  I spent the time and energy to learn how to change saddle height myself.  Folks, it wasn't nearly as hard as I imagined it would be as long as you have some sandpaper and a flat surface.  Lowered the strings to where they need to be.  Turns out it's not a bad player once properly setup.  I'm throwing in another star.		UPDATE:  I'm happy I took the time to get the guitar proper shape.  The more I play it, the more I like it.  Very bright tone, projects well, and plays nicely.  4 stars.
0,Finally got around to putting these up in my home studio.  They are AMAZING!  I love how they make the room look with the guitars mounted on them.  They are super sturdy.  I didn't have to find studs because the drywall anchors that come with it are so solid in the wall that they hold my guitars up no problem.  Saves room and looks great!
0,Perfect fit for a Pod HD500X.  It has quality zippers and decent padding, and it looks good with your Line 6 pedal.
0,Solid
0,This is pretty nice for the price.  I still have a lot to learn about it, though.
0,This stacker works well, but you might need a washer over the cymbal you're stacking on top of unless it's got decent weight to it. On top of a ride you really lose clearance for working the bell.
0,I decided to give these a shot after using Tortex for years. These seem to hold up pretty well and have a good flick. They dig in and feel satisfying between the fingers. They don't seem to have much memory like the Tortex though, so if you like that, I wouldn't recommend these.
0,Its really cool to jam with , sometimes you have to get the volume right to play over on the same rig but its just super quick way to get ideas out
0,For Christmas I bought my son 7 different pairs of drum sticks to sample.  He is a snare drummer in marching band and up to this point hand used almost exclusively the Vic Firth Ralph Hardimon Signature Corp Master.  That was the stick his Jr High teacher insisted on and is a great stick, but I wanted him to experience others.		This stick is his favorite out of the group for sound.  It was his choice to play his recent solo on, that is taking him to regional competition.  He has insisted that he will need another pair of these for regional competition.		These are not as strong as some of the others in the group and are showing signs of wear in this short time, hence the reason a new pair is needed.  While I wouldn't recommend this as a great practice stick it is a good performer.  Thankfully the price is low, so buy two pair.
0,Delivered on time and as described.  A useful purchase.
0,Its a good gig bag that I bought for storage.  It serves the purpose well. Some padding not allot but everything works and the bag is sturdy. Since its new I cannot comment on how it wears.
0,While I agree with others that the sheepskin is a bit high on the strap, it still functions perfectly on my shoulder.  I'm guessing that, if you play with the guitar very low on your torso, the sheepskin may be misplaced.  For me, with the strap nearly at its shortest length, the fit is great.  I really like this strap.  It's way better than the stiff Planet Waves cheapie.
0,Need study for a better use
0,came  on time works great
0,Sturdy, well built, interior is super plush.
0,I bought this not realizing that I needed a stereo plug, not mono. Despite that, this adapter worked and was easy to install, then remove when I found I had bought the wrong item.
0,I am an amateur musician who wanted amplification for a nylon string guitar. This amp has fulfilled those needs perfectly without breaking the bank.		First off, the looks are amazing. It looks like leather and feels nice and smooth to the touch as well. The speaker netting looks vintage and feels rugged and solid. All in all, looks like one of those classic amps you would get during the 60's.		In terms of sound, at least for a nylon string , it reproduces fairly accurately. No distortions at high volumes and you can even add a microphone to perform solo when needed. The voice reproduction is decent for its size as well. Its loud enough to fill a 50 x 50 room so you can use it in small gigs like a restaurant for example, where people will mostly keep their voices under control.		It has 3 knobs for equalization, which is pretty good for an amp this size. Mic and instrument independent controls.		I got it for 60 bucks, so you can use Camelizer to wait for a decent price, and purchase it then.		I've had it for about 6 years and it still works like a charm.
0,This table top music stand was just what I was looking for.  I read all the reviews here and decided to purchase it.  It is sturdy and easy to alter the angle.  Plus you can't beat the price. Something similar in my local music store was around $40.
0,Love these picks.  Experimenting with other colours in the range as each one produces a subtly different tone depending on the material used in the manufacture of the pick.  So far, these red ones are my favourites.  I have been playing guitar for decades and have never found a pick, (some considerably more expensive), that feel so natural and versatile.
0,Great cord at a good price. It works, what more does one need to say.
0,Can't go wrong with Elixir's. People say Nanoweb feels better, but Polyweb last longer and feels about the same in my opinion.
0,Well bought this one for my new bass, the old one I had was just a tad too long. This one on the other hand, so much better and the leather feels wonderful. The dark brown is just a perfect match to my ESP LTD-B4E, I think it will match any bass though the dark brown gives a classy feel IMO.	So gonna buy these for my other basses (I use Straplock).
0,Very compact and, sturdy with a decent price tag. It folds to a small size and, it is very easy to transport and setup.
0,I love it and hate it because I love it so much I sit down too much now
0,Very realistic tones.  Occasionally all notes in a chord do not sound if not pressed exactly simultaneously, unlike a real piano.  Altogether, for the money, I am very pleased.
0,Got it fast, and it fits my Squire prefect, thanks!
0,I LOVE THIS FLUID! For all the right reasons. I do agree that visually you see a slight increase between Backwood Bay and several of Froggy's other fluids. I am a very high volume (55+ gallons) user. Where I saw the difference was in 3 places. With Backwood Bay, I used less fluid for the same run times which meant I spent less $$$. Where I really noticed the difference was how gentle the fluid was on my heater blocks. I didn't feel like I had to clean them nearly as often. We have used tons of different fluids by tons of vendors over the years and Backwood Bay is by far the cleanest fluid ever. Lastly, I called the Froggy's Fog guys about storage.. I learned that Backwood Bay has an unlimited shelf life which is AWESOME! I used Backwood Bay in my Look Solutions Viper NT and it was PERFECT with NO residue whatsoever! Backwood Bay is well worth the extra couple of bucks per gallon.
0,Easy to set up. My condenser microphone sounds great through this.
0,Happy with product
0,I have been using various packaging and iterations of these strings since the 70's. They are the standard for me. I play in bars and fairs etc and change strings often on my main guitars (mostly telecasters) and these strings are just the best for me. buy with confidence.
0,Beautiful sound through headphones, even the ones supplied. Volume through the speaker is either faint or distorted, but is quite serviceable for solo practice.
0,pretty decent strings. Id rather go with elixers but I thought id try something cheaper.
0,Like this for holding things on my music stand that I don't want in the way of my music and don't want to bend to the floor to pick up.
0,I used this with an old Kawai K5000W and a new Akai Miniak on a new Windows 7 PC and a 3 year old Win-X workstation.  Worked without a hitch with stand alone virtual instruments and through Cubase.  Latency was low enough to be unnoticeable.  I think any keyboard made today should have a USB MIDI port but for those that don't (like the Akai) or for older synths (like my ancient Kawai) this works great and costs less than a single normal MIDI cable.
0,Solid, beautiful, killer sound. Just what I wanted.
0,perfect strings
0,great all around.  this thing gets really crunchy
0,In terms of their use as a pick, these are pretty close to any others, with the exception of the graphic, which I really like. Just for a reference he "mediums," seem to be somewhere around .80 mil.  I don't know if it's obvious in the pics, but the celluloid is more opaque than it is see through. I'll be grabbing more.
0,Love the harmonic tuning; need to try the natural tuning next.  If you are a Special 20 fan you will love this one too; they are nearly identical.  The Oskar feels just a little nicer in my hand, it is a little longer, slightly thinner, and has a less pronounced flange at the fingers.  All personal preference from this beginner.  If these appeal to you don't miss the new Hohner Rocket (a special 20 perfected but at 2X the price).
0,Quality Microphone for the price will not be disappointed	Well made all metal Beautiful sound
0,Well built. Very sturdy and solid construction. I also like the RFI and EMI protection along with the surge protection. They also didn't skimp on the 15 foot length of A.C. cord. A+
0,I bought these strings after a friend recommended them. When I first restrung my guitar and tuned it up I was pleased with the tone that these strings produced. I have had these strings on my guitar for just over 4 months now and they still sound great. I have not noticed any degradation of the strings as of yet and I play everyday. I have definitely found a string that I will use from now on. Awesome!
0,I bought the black version of this case (not the tweed) for my Fender Pawn Shop '51, which has a Strat body and a Tele neck. The guitar fits quite nicely in there. If you're just using the case to put your guitar in the back seat as you drive around, it works great. It will keep the guitar safe and absorb the bumps of the road. It also has a nice little accessory compartment, and is fairly light weight, really not much heavier than a gig bag.		However, if you're planning on flying cross country with this case, I would suggest getting something a little sturdier. As the other reviewers mentioned, this is made from fairly thin wood, not the layers of sturdy plastic that you'd get with an SKB case. If you need heavy duty protection for your guitar, I'd spend a few more bucks and get something nicer,
0,I bought this Ludwig set for my 18 month old son.  We initially bought him a set made by Kid Connection but he tore right through it.  So we decided to buy him a more durable set.  We looked at a similarly priced 5 piece set at a local music store, made by TKO, but decided to go with Ludwig, which we felt was a more reputable drum brand.  Glad we did.  In my opinion the Ludwig set is better quality, sounds better, and looks better.  The cymbal and hi-hat don't sound great, but are designed to take a beating, which is great because our son likes to hit the drums as hard as he can.  At 18 mos, he is just a little to short to reach the pedals comfortably, even with the drum throne at the lowest level, but that doesn't stop him from wanting to play.  The first thing he wants to do when he wakes up in the morning is play his drum set.  We anticapte this set lasting a while and are extremely satisfied with our purchase.
0,Was apprehensive at first but have grown to love them on my Bovier mandolin. Bright clean sound! Great value.
0,good
0,This is a cheaper tuner but it's a very accurate one. I used for tuning both my acoustic and floyd rose electric guitar. Acoustic is pretty simple but where it shined through was tuning the floyd rose which makes having a tuner of any sort a must. The accuracy of this is extremely good.
0,Love this thing for some of my small percussion items I use while singing. Don't have to bend down to pick up my shaker.
0,Vic Firth does it again. Saw a drummer using it at a jazz club in Washington DC.  Soft attack is consistent even if your foot forgets.
0,I like the construction of this product - nice solid feel to it
0,Best boom stand for live music on the market today. Period.
0,I need to practice, anyway this is really good!!
0,I've been trying out different gauges to experiment with different fretboard feels. These strings I have to say, stretched out and stayed in tune much faster than slinkys. They have great sustain and sound nice and chunky. I love the luster and shine of new strings, feels nice ans springy. Since this is my first time with this brand, I don't know how long they will stay good, but we'll see.
0,These D'Addarios maintain their crispness longer than most other conventional non-coated strings.  On my 40 year old Guild D44M they bring out the best sound ever.  Give them a try.  For the price they can't be beat.
0,Great bow for the price.  Very good balance.  Like it better than the Fiddlerman bow.
0,Finally done messing with other tuners. These things work great!
0,I'd buy another. Solid part, stood up to me installing it wrong and de-soldering/re-soldering. I did need to put a dab of CA glue on the switch quill to firmly secure the knob, but i have yet to see a fender blade switch that couldn't benefit from that.
0,i didn't really have any issues with the sound of the stock pickups. but i did wish that the buzzing noise would go away. these addressed my issue and still sound great! at a modest price too!
0,I switched to these for all my electrics (I have about 20 and play 4-6 regularly). The . 009 - .046 gauge makes playing, bending a bit smoother, and they last really well (I wipe on FastFret to lube the strings and stop corrosion). They do what . 010 - .046 strings do, but seem to play a bit easier. A lighter feel makes playing better as it frees you to play and not be concerned with  too much string tension.
0,<div id="video-block-RC4EWLIB430B9" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1iyTDVfVYS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61OlB0DamBS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;I received this item as a free sample. The following review is my honest and unbiased opinion:		This mic is entirely plug-and-play: I've simply been plugging it into my Mac and it's greatly improved my audio recording quality. As I note in my video, I've had to select the mic (audio line in) in my System Preferences -- but that only takes a second. This allows Audacity or whatever audio recording software you're using to pull audio from the mic.		This mic comes with the mic, a mount, the extendo-arm, and a pop shield. The pop shield is nice as it keeps you from recording your breath too much. I think it makes a big difference.		Note that there a lot of different mics out there, and you need to make sure that you're really shopping for a condenser mic if you buy this microphone. A condenser microphone is great if you plan to be speaking or playing directly into the microphone. If you want to record the sounds in a room, however, you will be better off with a multi-directional microphone. (Actually, you can get bidirectional mics, omnidirectional ones, etc.) I've used a shotgun mic quite a bit, which allows me to pick up sounds that are far from the mic -- but only when I aim the mic at the speaker.		If you're looking for a condenser mic to feed into your computer, I like this one. I'm sure there are mics out there that are WAY higher quality and probably also more expensive. But if you're looking for bang-for-the-buck, this is a nice mic for the price.
0,It's a nice distortion pedal and comes in handy really only when you're stuck with a very clean and sterile amp and you need a dirty crunchy sound. The box is well made and the tone is quite customizable. I found it a little thin sounding but not so much that I wouldn't use the pedal for what it's designed for.
0,Good product, just as described
0,works good
0,I've always like D'Addario strings, and always come back to them when I try other brands. But when I tried these I found like I had found 'the' strings for the sound I hear in my head and I love the wound third string and the way it sounds/responds to playing. They are perfect for my Ibanez semi-solid Artcore where I'm going for a jazz/blues/classic rock thing and that is exactly what they give me. So for me they are 5* strings. I think more people should try wound 3rds. They might find like I did that I prefer them.
0,Pickup came on time and well packaged. Nice sounding external acoustic pickup with good response to subtle picking styles without feedback. Designed for arch top style floating pick-guards but works well with my resonator. The paper thin pickup blade allows for some creative positioning. The design would of been improved with an attachment for the jack to the strap button avoiding messy tape or permanent installation.
0,These strings have become my mainstay for my acoustic. Absolutely love them and recommend them to everyone.
0,My first time doing a leveling job. Using this tool along with some great YouTube instruction (guitar fret leveling how and why - parts 1 and 2) rendered great job. No buzz. Of course requires crowning of frets and polishing afterward.
0,Works pretty good. Especially on a wood floor. I do not have to grip the cello with my knees now.
0,I use these on our Manhasset Model #48 Sheet Music Stands, to pickup acoustic guitars with Sure BATA 57A microphones.	This give me less clutter with 8 people singing for worship.
0,D'addario has been at the forefront of quality and long lasting strings for as long as I can remember.  This guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars.
0,These destroy moongel.
0,Perfect fit for my guitar and the Elliptical pegs keep the strap on better than the outdated round peg
0,It is awesome for the price, but it goes out of tune very quickly, which is frustrating to an 11 year old. But it's a great violin for an 11 year old! Especially since his arms are long enough that the 3/4 and 1/2 violins are no longer needed.
0,Fit perfectly and great quality
0,Excellent tuner for the money
0,Great strings , last a long time !!!
0,very cool, just right. not too bulky ; even for uke's and banjos's
0,I honestly didn't think these would have much of an impact on the sound of my floor tom but, holy cow!  I used pliers to pull off the old feet on my floor tom legs and then slid these on.  My floor tom now resonates more freely, sounds louder, and just has a better overall tone.  My band noticed the difference and said that my floor tom sounds much better.  I guess these work by decoupling the drum from the floor as much as possible.  Another benefit that I like from these is that the floor tom is about a half inch higher than before.  I prefer my floor tom to be as high as possible to make it easier for me to do backward (right to left) fills.  Aside from properly tuning your drums, this is one of the cheapest upgrades to improve the sound of your drums, especially if you have floor mounted toms.
0,Accurate tuning, versatile mounting, easy to read lighted display, long battery life and battery saver circuitry. Select to tune acoustically or through the mount.
0,New favorite for Eb tubing, I don't like 11's and 10's always feel like there's a little chunk missing in the low end. This gauge rocks! Excellent playability and great tone and harmonics in Eb tuning. I wish more companies made this gauge...
0,Doesn't feel amazing, but works as it should.
0,These strings have comfortable loose feel, but don't have quite as full range a tone as the DR hi-beams. They seem to keep their brightness a little longer than most strings and have a good punch in the midrange. Good 'bite' but not aggressive sounding, on a brightness scale I rate them 8/10.
0,I use these strings on my 2012 Les Paul Studio. They feel great, sound great, and last a really long time (at least for me). Add the benefit of being pure nickel and they don't wear on my frets as much.
0,Great sticks. I love the maple tones and the traction green dips.
0,11 bucks for two pickups that look identical to an EMG or Seymour Duncan how can you go wrong? They don't sound very good and there real noisy with feedback though but if you want to fix up an old guitar to like sell or something you can't put $200 worth of pickups in it so it's perfect for that they come with everything you simply can't go wrong
0,Great strap, love the smell of leather.grafics are cool.
0,Great cable. Too bad our practice area was dirty and it was hard to get the dirt off the cable once it was embedded.
0,This is actually good! It came with a carrying case, very compact. I unfolded it and the metal stand & frame seems study enough to hold my Beatles song book. So far I'm pleased with the quality of this item & glad that I finally ordered this one. I will update my review after a month or so because I've only been using this for 2days.
0,Overall, I like the quality of the sound/product a lot. The tone button makes my life a lot easier. It's quite easy to use.		Nevertheless, I wish there were a headphones out. Even when I want to practice only with headphones, I still have to grab my mixer and connect which is inconvenient. It can separately output dry and wet+harmony. I wish I could get all three separately.
0,I keep oscillating between Elixir and D'Addario coated strings on my Taylor 714.  Truth is that I'm not fully satisfied with either.  I like very light gauge strings on all my guitars, but I prefer a slightly thicker G string because I detune and retune frequently, which eventually results in popping the G string. These are decent strings but they tend to be overpriced.
0,I have ordered this before.  They are nice dulcimer strings.  My daughter has been playing the dulcimer for 8 years and this is the only strings we use and the only company we buy from.
0,What can be said about an adaper power supply. This product works great! No probles at all and it's easy to ues. thanks
0,More than the espected!!!
0,When I started looking for an item such as this, I wasn't even sure dual DIs in a single enclosure existed. Not only do they, but this one is no bigger than a regular DI box, which is a plus.		I'm a drummer and I bought this to run tracks and clicks coming L/R out of an iPod during rehearsal/shows. I have a splitter cable coming into this DI box, and when the signals come out they are balanced. The signal is clean and pure. There are just no issues here; nothing to write about.		This product is just a great deal; it would be a great deal if it were $10-20 more expensive. I'm probably going to order one or two more just to have on hand if I forget, lose, or drop it, even though it seems very well-built and could weather some rough handling.
0,Perfect fit, strong, and cheapest price.
0,Works great with our Shure ULX wireless SM58.  Wireless mics like the ULX SM58 are larger than a regular SM58, so you need this larger clip to hold them properly on a mic stand.
0,Top Notch.. Better than ANY STOCK HEADS
0,EXCELLENT MUSIC STAND FOR GIGS. ATTACH EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT SIDE. (YOU CAN UNSCREW THE CLAMP SHAFT AND SCREW IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. STURDY. EASY TO USE.
0,I purchased an older Alesis Multimix 8 USB (1.0) to learn how to record.  It was fine for basic use, but only allowed me to input 2 (stereo) channels into my DAW (64-bit Reaper).  The Saffire unit allows me to record single tracks for each instrument and vocal.  The box works flawlessly and is extremely quiet.  One reason that I chose the unit was for Windows 7 64-bit compatibility.  I've had zero issues with the box or the drivers using the newest download from Focusrite.  Being able to work in a native 64-bit environment is great, as I have a quad-core processor in my PC... lightning fast.  I did a great deal of research before settling on this product.		Another headphone out would be handy, but the single output serves its purpose well.  It's simple, easy to use, and I was up and running very quickly, even though I am a novice user.  The Ableton software included with the box is excellent, but I have a Reaper license and am attached to the software, so I continued to use Reaper as my DAW.  The preamps on the Saffire are excellent.		In summary, the Pro 24 is a quality unit with enough inputs and outputs for a home recording setup if you aren't trying to record an entire live band.  As I play all the instruments and use EZ Drummer for drums, I have plenty of jacks for input and output, with two outputs feeding my monitors.  I even plug in my turntable and record from vinyl through the Saffire unit.  I'm extremely happy with my Pro 24 and feel I made the right choice.
0,fun....
0,Everyone has what they like. I use different picks but have come to realize the old style celluliod picks never break and are always flexable, The wear very slowly and smoothly unlike plastic that dont. They also stick nice to your fingers with little movement.
0,Great
0,The only capo you'll ever need.
0,Just what I wanted
0,The bench is easy to assemble and appears to be robust.  I did not see anything on the box that indicated that this bench is manufactured by Yamaha so don't know why it is referred to as a "Yamaha" bench.
0,This is a sturdy product that has the features I need to offer a premium lighting option for my live shows. My only caveat is a "fit" vs. "function" consideration. Read on.		My setup relies on MIDI as I'm an electric violinist who uses a sequencer (Cakewalk Sonar) along with software for video orchestration (Resolume). I normally would not offer lighting with my shows, but it's a definite plus for a dance gig, or for a alternative venue (e.g., a fundraiser which features a full band in a larger room, but with DarkViolin in an adjoining space).		The lighting standard uses the DMX protocol, as other have mentioned. That is clearly the industry standard, but it's not the one in my laptop + outboard MIDI gear's sweet spot. To fully exploit DMX, which the GB 400 supports in and out, I would use a VST such as the DMXIS Show Buddy, which would give Sonar away to send "scene" changes over DMX but using MIDI note commands.		I have multiple MIDI floor control units such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Roland-FC-300/dp/B000QGDZUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Roland FC-300</a>&nbsp;which would allow for live lighting updates - e.g., an improvised tempo or volume change.		The sturdiness is appreciated. Seriously.  But the weight of the unit and its bulk make it somewhat more difficult to carry, even though it is roughly the size of a small guitar amp or the mass of the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Roland-KC-150-4-Ch-Mixing-Keyboard-Amplifier/dp/B000ECX6FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Roland KC-150 4-Ch Mixing Keyboard Amplifier</a>. If I were to bring this along on a regular gig, I wouldn't be a happy camper.		That said, I doubt if there are better alternatives out there. Like those folks who manufacture 150 LB speaker cabs, it suggests Marq is somewhat unconcerned that real people have to deal with gravity and bulk when adding lighting to a portable gig. Bad intonation is one result of a tired violinist fatigued by gadget transport.		See photo for a height comparison if you have clearance issues. The shipping dimensions apply to you if the as-shipped box is your transport method.		Misc gig note: Keep in mind the power consumption added by this unit.		The Marc FAQ for this product is readable and indispensable.		Upshot: This device will be used at a wedding party shortly and will add the sort of  visual sparkle that nothing else in my gadget arsensal could.
0,I'm happy, it works well...
0,Give your congas a raise! All puns aside, I like them a lot.
0,We have bought three so far :)
0,A little off kilter, but holds heavy board with no issues.
0,I love the Novation MiniNova, it's awesome right out of the box, and even better with free sound packs available from Novation through their website which are easy to install. You get a free code for Ableton Lite as well which is really nice.
0,Very good and durable
0,Shipped on schedule, nice knob, and construction much preferable to the "box" type (have you ever looked inside one of those? Cheap, cheap, CHEAP. Little plastic rings that break with too hard a sneeze. I've removed many, many broken/worn-out plastic-enclosed "box-style" 3-way toggles... this "open" style seems to last FOREVER.
0,I don't know if I'm kidding myself, and WANT these to sound better than reg'lar ole strings, but damn: they sound good.
0,Mogami Gold.  Great great cable.  When you have all your cables changed over to Mogami wire...it makes a definite and improved sonic difference.  This is not fairy dust or the power of suggestion; cables matter.
0,Easy to use.  Instructions easy to understand.  Intuitive design.  Overall a great product.
0,Very happy with the quality.
0,High quality XLR cable. I needed another cable for the field. This is very flexible, making wrapping a breeze. Very glad I got this particular cable.
0,I use this for low volume activity in a convenient place.  The surface I use it on is slippery so, in addition to the rubber piece on the balancing pole, I added a couple of small rubber pads to the lower side of the ledge.  It does what I expect of it!
0,Well built economical Rack Space.  Best bang for the buck that I have found.  Not for serious touring, but plenty sturdy enough for local band type duty.  A bit on the heavy side.
0,Tuned my 12 string dreadnought with it 15 min. after it arrived, works great Thank You!
0,I give this product a five star rating. I have always liked D'Addario strings on stage or off for their reliability and can always depend on them. I have used this product for decades and compared to other guitar strings, are the best I have used after 50 years of playing the guitar
0,This thing is the real deal. Super well made and does its job like a champ. Same sound quality as my expensive monster cable
0,For the money, cant go wrong. I use Shure wireless PG58 and SM58 but I wanted something to have on hand as back up or just for smaller events where I only needed to make a couple quick announcements. I was about to buy the corded PG58 and came across this Pyle. I said what the heck, if I don't like it Amazon will return it. So I got it. Tested it out today and I must say for 10 bucks...I am happy with it. Its not my Shure but for what I purchased it for...it will work perfect. If you just need a mic to make general announcements I think you will be very happy with this. One thing not mentioned in the ad...it does come with a mic cable, XLR to 1/4.
0,loved it
0,The case has nice padding, high quality construction, and the design is beautiful. I love it.
0,Best Guitar Strings. Great Sound.
0,Very nice.  Good stitching.  Thick padding.  Zippers work smoothly.
0,My title says it all. This obviously isn't a high end strap, so the material feels cheap and stiff. For $5 though, it does it's job. There's plenty of length and the ends are made of either cheap leather of a synthetic. I'm not quite sure what. I wouldn't trust it to hold up for multiple on/off players. I use Dunlop strap locks on all of my guitars and basses though, so it's a non issue for me. For the price you can't go wrong. I only took away 1 star because I wish it wasn't quite so stiff, even after a good month of usage.
0,I think I need a bigger pad..		5/5 Stars for quality and use of materials.		I'm just "that Guy" who decided to put a SVS PB2000 on it and it fits.. but I need another layer to support this. haha
0,Seems to work well. Easy to use, doesn't get in the way. In this area's dry Winters the packs go very quickly. The rest of the year they last a long time. I do notice a difference when I use them vs when I go too long without replacing them or if I leave my guitar out of the case for a week or more. You've got to be careful with good solid wood guitars, these seem to help.
0,I exchanged a M-Audio Fast Track that was effn horrible for this interface and this has treated me well.  It was bundled with Studio One Artist and both are great.  I gave it 4 stars b/c it could use more in's and out's and produces minimal low pops (once ever 30mins or so).  And the very low infrequent pops do not show up in the recording....I'm happy!
0,Even though this is a smaller mesh pad (this is my snare), I'm much happier with this than a few higher end ones (and larger). I only wish they made this in a larger dimension (I'd buy a 10 or 12" version happily). I have a TD11k and upgraded all the pads. I first purchased a PD105 (USED) and it actually was a nice pad, however it just looked weird with the kit I have, and also, Roland recommended getting a separate stand because of its' weight. Second, I purchased the PDX100, which would have been ideal. BUT the 'hot spot' people are complaining about is actually a real thing. There's a spot on the center that will double the volume if you hit it there.		Size isn't perfect, but it just works well, at least for the kit I have.
0,:)
0,Exceptionally high quality.  Great value and works perfectly.
0,Love the style. Sounds are great. Can not wait to	give it to my little gal. Know she'll have years of	fun.
0,great resonate head with a nice tone and full body sound that brings life to my toms.
0,This tuner has the option of using a built in mic or a vibration sensor for detecting the frequency. The vibration sensor requires that the tuner is clipped to the instrument. However, there isn't a good spot to clip it to a violin. Switching on the mic sensing feature allows me to simply clip it to a music stand and tune up, no worries about it falling off.
0,A little stiff, I am sure it will loosen up with age and use. A very good value.
0,This item is cheap in price, is easily used by simply clamping onto the guitar and makes tuning easy.		Essentially, you clamp this onto to the guitar and press the button down.  Strum the string and you will get a scale that moves into the sweet spot and goes from blue to green when it hits the sweet spot.  The screen lights up so you can use this in the dark.		I have tested this with my own ear (not so accurate but learning) and with online tuners (pretty darn accurate) and it works.  Recommended.
0,If you like a brighter crystal clear tone like I do these are the strings for you. I started out usuing GHS strings the first 5 or 6 years of playing because thats what SRV used and everyone was trying to find his tone however I got experimental and tried some D Addarios and fell in love. Ive tried every string under the sun but nothing compares to the crisp bright tone of D Addario.
0,It is quiet.  Just turn the knobs until it sounds good.  I like it.
0,Well built!  I first purchased 3 of these and about 2 years later, I needed 2 more.  I shopped on Amazon for cheaper alternative since these cost me about $13 each.  Other manufacture had pictured a slightly flimsier model than the solid K & M model and the other manufacture charged less but shipping was charged where K & M did not.  The other manufactures price with shipping was now just $3 shy of the K & M.  I wanted the screw, mount design the same so for all the reasons above, I went back to K & M.  I am pleased with the construction of the plate, the strong treading, material used, paint quality and over-all looks of this unit.  This is a good product.
0,awesome  amp, easily handles all situations, sounds great too
0,i plug it into my keyboard (a cheesey casio with midi plugs) and then into my computer and its a perfect connection for use with garage band.  the "in" and "out" seem like they are backwards because it only works when i plug in to out and out to in, but i don't really care about that.  its a far cry from the old clunky boxes that you used to have to plug into the wall and to the keyboard and to the computer.  now its just straight from the keyboard to the usb and you're done.  it also saves you a lot of money because almost ALL keyboards have a midi in/out plug- so you can use this simple wire instead of buying a usb ready keyboard/controller.
0,Great Cable, bought a bunch of these cable at the NAMM Show
0,Well made
0,Very low price, this item works as designed.  I play in several groups including a symphony.  Now while everyone else is tuning up I can enjoy the accuracy of my Korg without other instruments affecting my tuning.  That plus the other trombones were impresed.
0,I have these on my old fretless Fender P-Lyte and they are just perfect for that bass.  Just enough thump to sound dark and boomy with the P pickup, but enough growl to sing through the J pickup.  Exactly what I was looking for.
0,This is a very nice looking back plate and for the price its cheep the holes are in the right place for the screws .
0,This cover is great as it fits well, has a flap that opens to access handle, and is attractive.  It is rather expensive for what it is, but I felt it was worth it to protect the beauty of my amp.
0,I have 3 of these chained up, giving me 24 XLR inputs of fun. The only downside is that I have to change the sampling rate from 96K to 44K or 48K (sorry, don't remember which) when kicking in the 3rd unit, so, if there's any doubt as to if I'll need the additional 8 inputs, I need to make sure to change those settings before doing any projects.		That said, as an individual or paired-set - I could not be happier with the Firestudio Project. Works great with Sonar, I think I got my first unit with Sonar 8 - it's been flawless since they got the drivers/firmware updated back when Windows 7 x64 was pre SP1.		I did get one of these very early on that had an issue - where the levels would show something in software, and, when recorded, it was making some noises - called Presonus, and they shipped me a different unit - this was a few years ago, and the 2 I've used until adding this third unit have ran flawlessly...
0,Works great in all my valve instruments!!
0,Great Amazon price as usual. Item as described, works perfectly.
0,This microphone records my voice as clearly as crystal. The sound quality is ridiculously crisp and clean. My vocal recordings honestly sound even better than my perception of my own voice! This microphone draws out the deep rich frequencies in my voice and gives me a very professional sound. I have experimented with recording my voice with and without a ceiling fan running in the background. In either recording, there is absolutely no background noise whatsoever. This microphone does an amazing job of filtering out unwanted noise while preserving and even enhancing your vocal sound.		The headphone jack is what makes this microphone worth every penny. The ability to monitor my performance in my headphones whilst recording is absolutely essential and this microphone produces such a clean and pure signal void of any noise. I experimented with jacking up the headphones volume and background noise was still nowhere to be heard. I am extremely satisfied with the quality of this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about making quality recordings.		As a last note, you can even turn a volume control on the front of the microphone to cross fade between hearing 100% microphone in your headphones to hearing 100% of your computer in your headphones. Simply adjusting this control with your finger allows you to listen to a song on your computer while simultaneously monitoring yourself - all in your headphones. This was the icing on the cake for me.
0,Sound very nice on my new cajon. Unless you play crazy hard, I don't think the brushes will mar the playing surface - I will update if that happens.		Unlike conventional brushes, these "retract" by pushing the brush part back into the stick. A bit sticks out, so you pull on that to put them into play.		Anyway, worth the money to get a different timbre and playing technique out of your instrument.
0,Nice assortment of picks...great for a variety of styles of play.

0,Well made comfortable strap at a great price!
0,By far my favorite strings for my Taylor guitar.  The PB have a warmer tone which helps since Taylors have such a bright sound.
0,I went with this over road runner because of the pouch designs which i like better because they are square. Unfortunately I think the Roadrunner is better quality, thicker material.
0,everything perfect
0,I tried this but ended up going back to Tortex.  I like the satin finish on the Tortex better and the way it bends.  The Ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly.  Ultex sounds more like the Fender celluloid.
0,The sound is good on this amp, but I don't like it more than my orange amp. The orange crush amp has better effects and just a better overall sound than this amp. Its still not a bad amp for the price though.
0,I was previously under the impression that all mic stands were created equal. As a result I went through several 15-25 dollar stands without giving it much thought; always being fairly disappointed when one would begin to wobble or strip out in all the wrong places. However, I eventually came across the Hercules Transformer Tilt Base Mic Stand and I can confidently say that I will never go back to the dime-a-dozen variety if I can avoid it. For the amount of money I spent on cheap stands I probably could have purchased several of these beauties. But one is enough for any particular job. I have been using the same stand for well over a year now, even though it also splits time as the work horse for a children's school of music, and it still functions flawlessly.		Before I go any further I believe that it should be taken into consideration that this review is coming from the perspective of a lead singer, and I utilize it as could be expected. That being said, beyond its extremely sturdy construction, the Hercules Transformer has been a true pleasure, primarily due to its Quik-N-EZ Height Adjustment Grip. With one hand, and truly with ease, the height of the stand can be adjusted on the fly like no other stand I have ever used. I also enjoy the tilt feature when I feel the need to get a little theatrical and give my mic a quick dip. While I have never actually utilized any configuration outside of the typical equidistant tripod legs, I do like the fact that the stand could be configured to lean in over my guitar if I desired to play while seated.		All in all, considering how poorly so many mic stands are constructed, the Hercules is worth every penny, and it will almost certainly pay off in dividends over the life of the stand. I would certainly recommend this product for anyone who is in the market for a microphone stand!
0,Its affordable and it works.  Its a nice little adapter for your low impedance cable to your high impedance input.
0,The "Quick Release" functions great and saves me loads of precious time in setup and tearing down at gigs. Prevents cross threading too. I also put one under my Yamaha MG82cx Mixer and eliminated the frustration of screwing two mini thumb-wing screws in every time I mounted it to the Boom for stage-use.
0,It is Vary - Good!  I LOVE IT.
0,this is a must when cutting holes in a bass drum head
0,the best for my electric
0,Good strings!
0,Good quality cable works well
0,Great Tuner. Accurate, easy to use. Can't beat the price. Everyone I know has one, you should have one too!
0,Always happy with D'Addario, tone quality and tune retention is perfect.
0,Easy on the finger as super light with nickle. Easy to slap and pop, yet, retains that great tone. Nice trade off.
0,They work alright and have good options, but they're a little light. They may tip over if you have a heavy mic and a long extension on them.
0,Love it. This is the third one I bought, and love the Fender part. This is a concert size which worked better for me. Also, liked tuning it whit having them all turn the same direction. Nice finish and feel. I did by a soft case for it.
0,My son loves it!
0,Replaced for Schallers. Look like Schaller's with Fender branding. Excellent quality. Right price. Recommended.
0,great value.
0,Some reviews and descriptions say that these keys are "touch-sensitive," but I can assure you that this is NOT the case.  Whether you touch the key firmly or lightly, the sound will be the same.  Lack of touch-sensitivity aside, this is a great keyboard overall with many features.  Changing voices and rhythms is not the easiest, most intuitive process -- in fact, there's a lot of stuff that just seems difficult to figure out -- but through trial and error, a bit of Googling and referring to the enclosed literature, you'll get the hang of it!  I was perfectly happy using mine on a laptop cart instead of a stand -- and since the keyboard is so lightweight, I could easily put it in the closet when not in use.
0,Light weight, and little on the short side ( heightwise ) but excellent for instrument mics.
0,Good price Works great
0,Works great.  Would buy from this seller again.
0,Good for the money but sheet music or a thin book is all your putting on this thing
0,It's a $56- dollar case! It's hardshell,padded,locks and has storage. What else do you want? Someone to place your guitar in the case and carry it for you too! If you want a $200-dollar custom case,go buy one and stop complaining! I think the case is awesome and does its job just fine! Every guitar needs a nice home. This is it...
0,That's an awesome mic for the price.
0,Naturally the sound doesn't resonate as much as I'd like it to but it's a great guitar. I traveled with it and love how compact it is. The strings it came with were a little shoddy but I plan on replacing those for cheap. I love how the neck is very close to full size so transferring to my Yamaha is seamless. Very well made and a great guitar to travel with.
0,Grandson ordered this
0,Arrived in great shape. Good guitar for the price.
0,Pretty cool gadget... a whole lot less trouble than opening and closing bottles, cans, or sprays, and does on a set of old strings.
0,product was as advertised and very prompt delivery.
0,Very nice strap.
0,Economical packaging. Reliable company. Strings have bright, pleasing sound.
0,I saw Paul Mccartney with a pop filter like this on his microphone in Abbey Road and thought that would be perfect!  Why don't they make those any more?  I guess they do.. and for some reason this company that sells mostly fashion stuff has them... I got two.	Works as you would expect.	Did you know that both remaining Beatles are left handed?
0,D'Addario strings are awesome!  These strings speak with a bold,defined and POWERFUL voice.  The bass strings boom with thunderous lows and the treble strings glisten with sparkling highs without being too harsh.  They are very sweet to the ears and tonally balanced across the board without one frequency overpowering the other. I have tried a lot of different strings, DR's, Ernie Ball, Dean Markley, Elixir, GHS, you name it.  After putting a set of EXL110's (10-46 gauge) on my Gibson SG special faded and comparing them to Ernie Ball I noticed a huge difference, not only were they brighter but they lasted longer.  I used to change a set of Regular Slinkys every two months but with EXL's I was changing strings every five to six months. They work in a variety of applications, metal, hard rock, jazz, blues, reggae, etc. and respond great at any dynamic level.  D'Addario is "The Player's Choice" for a reason after using these I can't see myself using anything else!  They feel good,sound great and are exceptionally consistent from set to set. If you haven't used them yet, give 'em a try and see what you're missing.
0,It plays, and plays nicely. I don't actually know how this particular flute is supposed to sound, but I played other bamboo flutes, and this one is good. It has a broad range (2+ octaves) and can be easily overblown. It is also well-tuned. Overall, to be honest, It is a much better instrument than I expected to get for this price! Totally recommend.
0,A subtle improvement in the clarity of the sound on my guitar after adding. They look great and are a suitable option instead of bone.
0,Great quality cable and connectors.  Would definitely purchase this again.
0,Good stand, fast service.
0,good sticks
0,This mic holder works well with my cordless mic (which is wider than standard, tapered mics). It has to stretch open a ways for the mic to fit in it. I bought two in case one breaks.		You'll have to tighten down the screw that keeps the tension on it because your mic will start to tilt downward if you don't.
0,The NANOWEB coating makes these strings oxidation-resistant, improving their life AND they are great sounding, too. A good product, well thought-out. This my fourth set (on three instruments)and I am liking how well they are working for me. Good stuff.
0,Great!
0,Excellent
0,It's an amazing product, very accurate. Delivery was very fast. I'm 100% satisfied. One more praiseworthy thing is that the update information during transportation period was excellent. It's a fantastic experience of my first ever purchase from amazon.com.
0,The product was well packaged, and looks great right out of the box. The keys are full sized, and the keyboard is light without feeling cheap.		The keys are a bit stiff, but they do register touch well. The simplicity and size of this keyboard is what sold me on it, and I look forward to using it to make great music.
0,I bought these strings after reading quite a few favorable reviews on the internet.		I use them on a Douglas Shadow electric guitar.	It's a cheaper guitar that has double humbuckers with a three-way pickup selector switch.		These strings stay in tune better than the cheaper strings that I have tried.	DR Pure Blues have the "warm" tone that I look for.	There is no tinny sound that I found with some cheaper strings.		I prefer these strings over the other brands that I have tried and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again.
0,received on time and as described
0,Good product and service. Recommend
0,TASCAM's history is of really well-engineered products, sometimes overengineered, solid performance and proper functionality for its task at hand.		The four mic preamps all have wonderful headroom, handle transients well, are quiet and have a rich, detailed sound.  Instrument inputs handle active low-B bass along with Strats, Teles and weak off-brand pickups fine.		As sales prices drop on this unit to the $180 range, this becomes an incredible deal that pushes that fifth star into action.		Used in conjunction with Mixcraft 7, this provides a very high-quality signal to my DAW.  The ASIO drivers are specifically for this product, do not use any generic drivers and, more importantly, follow the directions on installation of the drivers if you're using Windows (do not accept Windows' attempt to install its own drivers!).		The only weakness is that, to get simultaneous 6-input capability, one must activate the TASCAM mixer software, a light load on the system but kind of an inconvenience for those with systems on the edge of being overwhelmed.  My dual core 2.2GHz/4G RAM laptop eats this stuff up with no problem at all! Otherwise, all you have is a selection of a left, right or stereo input.
0,This could be described as a clean boost or mild overdrive. Of course if you turn it all the way up it does get into real overdrive territory, but I don't think that will be most people's primary use. It also has EQ type characteristics with the body, air, and sun and moon settings. These are not so much a substitute for bad incoming EQ, but tone shapers focused on certain EQ ranges, more like switching pickups on a guitar. There is something very complicated going on with the interactions of the various knobs, which I cant fully understand, but it translates in practice into giving you a really great but distinct sound at most any setting.
0,Not the simplest straight forward MIDI Pedal board to configure and set up, but once set up it works fine. I got a third party piece of software, iFCB for $20, and it makes everything much easier. Don't get the third party ROM unless it has a feature you must have. The latest versions of the included ROM  works fine for me for everything I have tried..		I use mine mainly with Bias FX/BIAS, Logic Pro X, MainStage, and my Roland Juno JS-88 through an iConnectivityAudio4+ (iCA4+) interface into both a Retina MacBookPro and an iPad. I actually have two FCB1010 pedals daisy chained together with the Roland and ICA4+. I've also used the FCB with the iPad via the iCA4+ of course, with many iOS apps as well with no issues.		The thing is solid like a rock and heavy. The standard pedal feedback in not as positive as I would like it, i.e. no first sense of a solid clicks through my feet and things are a little close together for me, I have size 13 feet. The expression pedals are also soft and have very week tactile feedback as well. There range of motion is also shorted than I would like. For the price this is still a good deal, but I'm probably going to get a good expression/volume pedal as well to add to my chain. I could not find anything with better pedals for less than 3-4x the price. I did end up buying two of these :)
0,They fit very well.  I carefully worked them over my microphone.  They fit perfectly.  I really dig the colors.  I'm satisfied with my purchase.
0,I use this to run a single, mono XLR shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my Tascam DR-40, which saves me a step in post-production.  The quality is fine and it does what it's supposed to do.  Good price for a good product.
0,I've tried a lot of strings and these are my favorites, although I use the heavier MLT 2036 strings sometimes.	These ones bend easier. The heavier ones have a better low end and buzz less.		Both last as well as the more expensive Ball and Gore (elixir), coated strings I have used.	And I like the sound better.
0,Good product love it
0,Excellent quality and looks great. Works on a bass as well as guitar...
0,Doesn't feel as sturdy as a tool should feel. The winding arm was wobbly so I tightened it with a screw driver. Now I have this screeching noise every time I'm winding up a string.		Overall its ok.
0,Warm, fat, and very versatile. You really can't go wrong with one of these in the neck position. One of the classic aftermarket neck pickups. Seymour Duncan has excellent wiring diagrams on their website. If you can figure out which end of a soldering iron gets hot, you can install one. I paired one with a SD 59' Combo at the bridge on a 93' Samick-built Epiphone G-400 and the sound is phenomenal. Highly recommended!
0,Very good ear phone under $200. I got a Thanksgiving cyber deal getting 2014 version with hard case for $149. Already use it in home studio and awesome sound with comfort fit. Recommend to any music lovers.
0,I have been playing electric guitar for over 20 years, and in that time I've tried many, many different strings: various flat wounds, half rounds, and round wounds ranging from gauges 9s to 12s. I've been using these D'addario 11s for years on all my standard electrics and I'm quite happy with them. They stay in tune well, last a long time, are relatively inexpensive, are consistent, and sound great: bright but not too bright, and balanced between the wound and plain strings.
0,great. .sturdy and protect the board very well
0,As the brand , it's so great, and the price is excellent, keep up the good work
0,They work and I have no problems with them. Good price also.
0,It took me several days to figure out how to properly tune my piano. I downloaded the book that came with the tool, it was more like a PowerPoint with very few pages. I did a search on YouTube and found some videos that helped. Overall I would say this is worth the money, especially if you have your piano tuned yearly.
0,Great product, I build Cigar Box Guitars and use it top string those along with my other guitars. Winds great, cuts strings great, would recommend it for any musician.
0,bought this for a little VOXAC4 mini. I was looking for less distortion in this little amp and as an 12AX7 has a gain structure of 100 and a 12AU7 of about 20 I put one of these in. Perfect match with a JJ EL84 power tube. The distortion doesn't come on until the volume is almost dimed, PERFECT! This was for someone that plays violin and acoustic guitar and now this little VOX really sings. Great tube and stone cold silent.
0,Good strings, nice response, good tone. Will purchase again.
0,Man, I love Fender parts. Minimally more expensive than bargain bin parts, but everything fits properly, works like it should and has a nice, slick coat of chrome (or nickel). Either way, the 6 saddle hardtail is unparalleled, particularly for the price. Package doesn't include mounting screws, as it does from some retailers, but they're easily sourced elsewhere.
0,Great Product.  Works as expected.
0,Excelent!!!!
0,bright sounding, clear and aggressive tone. too bad it only stays bright for a week. Standard ernie ball strings lasts 2 and a half. Overall its ok strings.
0,Just the amp to get you started in modeling. I am very impressed. It is way better than my Peavey Vypyr and a heck of a lot lighter too!
0,Quite a nice little reverb pedal. Works great in my effects loop or in front of an amp. Good clean reverberation trails and no extraneous noise, even at high volume levels. As with every Donner pedal I've purchased this little box is sturdy and well built. They actually weigh a little more than the Mooer and Eno/ExAmp pedals I have. I like the sound of all 3 reverb modes, but the Room is probably my favorite. Great pedal, incredible value, top notch product.		Now after using this pedal for a while, I have a problem. By itself, and with some boost/od/distortion pedals, it works just fine. With the majority of my drive pedals it makes a high pitched whine or whistle when it's engaged. It's especially noticeable with a high gain distortion pedal. I still can use it by itself or with a clean boost, but it is unusable with most of my drive pedals. It's not a loud whine, but it does become irritating very quickly. Just a word of warning. I guess my next move is to get a Hall of Fame.
0,Have used this product for years. Bought my first bottle from the inventor himself on a hot, dark night in Las Vegas many moons back
0,Good for the price, seems to sound better when guitar volume is high.
0,Very pleased with the Kirlin Csble , will be ordering another one .
0,Controls our lights and changes color as needed. The sliders are a little touchy but you can get used to them.
0,Great tuner.  Fast, accurate and easy.  It stays in my practice room, because there's nothing more tacky than having a clip-on tuner onstage.
0,Just what I needed
0,Nice slide. I only just picked up slide guitar myself so I might not know what a great slide is. Works for me.
0,exactly loke the music store was selling a single for the same price.
0,good
0,When you consider sound, durability and playability this may be the best diatonic harp out there. Year after year, purchase after purchase you just never get a bad one and the rumor is true...they stay in tune longer than most.	This is what's called a "large chassis diatonic" , it's the same thickness and the hole spacing is the same as your Special 20's and Marine Bands but the harp is a bit longer and deeper. The air space under the covers is larger and the harmonica has sort of a big chromatic sound to it, it's bigger, fuller with a buzzy rasp that I really like. Bends and vibratos are rich and controllable. They are sealed well right out of the box.	I am a huge fan of the Hohner Special 20 but my harp case is split 50/50 with LO's. For sheer speed I gravitate to the S20 but for everything else I grab an Oskar, that's just me though. Might be my weird way of giving them equal playing time. You can't go wrong with either one.
0,All you need in a metronome! I love the sounds and it's easy to adjust to what your needs are. The amplification of volume is perfect for me so...
0,Nice, I bought 3
0,I use these on slide guitar builds and am happy with them.
0,get the extension cord for this if you're gigging and trying to record the band.  Love the colored flashing levels ti assist monitoring recording levels from a distance.
0,Vandoren makes the best clarinet reeds, in my opinion.  When I was performing regularly, I used a  3 1/2 size reed.  It's been a few years and I've recently starting playing again in a community band and needed a softer reed.  I didn't want to go down in quality so I went with Vandoren.  I didn't have time to run to a neighboring town to purchase any and Amazon was there!  Thanks Amazon!
0,This works well, and can be placed almost anywhere in your kit.
0,Great for beginners to on the go musicians. Has headphone jack so you can better play and hear the metronome. Worth the money.
0,good fit and finish
0,These are perfect headphones for almost anyone. I'm an audio engineer for a living, both live and studio. For the money I don't think there's anything that can touch these for accuracy. They are true over-rated headphones even for someone with larger ears. I love that the cable unplug from the headphones with a mini-XLR connector... it's always the cable that gets messed up with headphones and this one simply disconnects for transport, and can be replaced.	They do not fold up compact like some headphones do. They're large. Also, they don't noise cancel much. If you do live concert sound and need isolation from noise I'd recommend the Sennheiser HD280 Pro. But for home use and studio use these are excellent. I watch TV through these and really enjoy movies and shows the way they were intended to be heard.
0,Whether it fits you is going to be hit or miss. I found that it fit me perfectly. It's perfectly smooth and comes in a convenient case that'll help protect it when not in use. If you're looking for a warmer, more round tone than your metal slide and are new to glass slides, I recommend this one. Be warned though that it has a bottom so your finger won't go all the way through like with a metal slide, so whether this slide is comfortable for you is going to depend on your hand size.
0,I bought this for my Schecter Studio Stiletto fretless, which is a very heavy bass guitar.  This strap disperses the weight of my bass very effectively so I can practice for hours without feeling the weight.  Strap  button holes are tight, the way they should be, so I don't worry about my bass slipping off.  And it LOOKS GREAT!!  This is a top quality strap, well made.  My bandmates asked me about when they saw it.		The only "issue" is the color.  It's just a touch more red than expected - but it goes very well with my bass.  To help you consider this strap, look at ALL the photos.  From all the pictures here on Amazon, the one that looks the most red is the most accurate.		I'd buy it again if I somehow ruined it (how?).
0,I own two of these, and they are the best that I've found for muting an xlr mic in a live setting.  When your foot is resting on it, the mic is muted.  When your foot is off, the mic is live.  It's a device for a pretty specific use.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the case itself, while very sturdy and heavy duty, makes an audible "click" when you activate it.  It seems the click is by design.  The click is pretty quiet, but if you ever plan to hand operate this within audible range of other live mics, you'll hear it.  However, the device is still of high enough quality that I bought a second one.  Rolls is a great brand, and this mute pedal lives up to their high standards.
0,Great alternative after Marley foot switch, inexpensive alternative to proprietary units.
0,Very sturdy, well received product. Sounds very well on saxophone and as expected.
0,Liked it, but didn't love it.  While I used this pot for a mod, I ended up changing it out for the greater versatility of a Fender TBX.  The big selling point on this pot is the ability to take the pot out of the circuit when it is fully engaged for a clean pass through sound.  Other than that it is a quality tone pot.  In order to use it as a volume pot you must wire it in a way that I found limiting to the tone I was seeking, which went against my reason for wanting to try it as a volume pot (for which it was advertised in the title description).  I found that my desire in a volume pot is always for the audio taper.  This would make a great tone pot for someone that desires typical fender pot range with the added perk of being able to come cleanly out of circuit for the audible "feel" of a boost in volume when fully engaged.  If you are looking for greater "range" in tone then I found the TBX much more satifying when wired correctly for the tone range I was pursuing.
0,Very good quality recording using my iPhone or iPad. I use it with the Bossjock audio app and has good reproduction. The wind noise cancellation is decent. You have to be careful with placement of the microphone to prevent clothes rustling noise. A nice feature is the headphone jack that allows for monitoring of the audio.
0,Functioned as It should have been! perfect size for probably any strap even my mandolin. good price as well, Thanks!
0,Works great for all Sennheiser evolution mics, and also for the usual suspects...SM57's and SM58's, etc.  These clips aren't too hard,  or too soft, they're just right.  In fact, they are much better than the flimsy clips that come with the expensive MD431 II.  Ignore the dimwits who gave this clip a low rating because they can't read and don't know what an "evolution" series mic is, or not smart enough to use a simple screwdriver to slightly tighten the screw in the clip.
0,Recommended by my daughter's band director.
0,What can I say, I love the sound and feel of these strings and they really do seem to last a very long time.  You sometimes do get what you pay for.
0,Quality seems good. Works as it said
0,I made this purchase to send to my grandson, and per my daughter who opened the box, the color wasn't as red as pictured.  She said, "It's more of a shade of maroon than a cherry red," but she thought it was a nicer shade for a boy.  I took other reviewers comments to heart (about the mouthpiece) and purchased a Yamaha mouthpiece and it sounds great, is easier for him to blow and even his band instructor said he was impressed.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend the sax with the Yamaha mouthpiece... only reason for 4 stars, since original mouthpiece was difficult to blow.
0,Little to say about this incredible little stomp box: no color on your sound, build like a tank, large display perfect for those smelly and dark bars and joints where all musicians play and it has KORG brand printed...and for me thats enough to trust this great tunner.		Cheers!!!!
0,Really cool little contact mic. You could make your own for a few dollars, but this is a solid product.  I wish the clip was stronger, I use this mic for trippy effects on my ride cymbal, but it vibrates too much and falls off.
0,Over the past 40+ years of playing guitar I have tried every type of capo made, from the old elastic ones to the Kyser clamp-style. I find that the Shubb capo has been the best one for my needs. It doesn't pull the strings out of tune, is easy to use, and can fit right in my pocket when not in use. I play a Luna Muse 12-string and this does a great job. I like that it came in black so I can easily identify it from the 6-string capo which is chrome. I highly recommend this capo.
0,Very good quality and price
0,I bought this strap to put on a Zager ZAD20 acoustic.  The guitar is finished in a beautiful glossy black.  I figured the softer cotton strap would be gentler on the finish.  I coupled the strap with a Martin leather head stock strap tie to avoid having to use the string.  It worked out very nicely.  I chose the burgundy color because I thought it complimented the black finish of the guitar.		The strap itself is very well made of a soft cotton strapping and nice suede leather ends.  Very nice, very classy.  It cost a bit more than alot of other straps out there, but it is well worth it.  I highly recommend this guitar strap.

0,Heavy duty part, and super fast shipping from this company!!!
0,Great product and fast shipping. Thanks
0,I am glad that GHS picked up on this old product.  When the other company switched to plastic cans from metal, the product dried up easily.  GHS went back to the metal containers.  I'm hoping it lasts as long as the original did.
0,Product was delivered quickly and the cables seem to be good quality

0,Lifelong vocalist / guitarist. I have fronted more than a few bands. My current (and last band) have all been using various mics since we got together about 6 months ago. My go to for years has been the indestructible Shure SM 58 Beta, and we had a Shure SM 58 and an EV something and a cheap Audio Technica (drummers...sheesh). I've had my beta for 12 years or more. I swear by em'. Well now let's just say... I swore by em.  I was on a band forum online and the microphone debate came up. 80% of the musicians argued this mic was the one to have. I am an old dog, but am open to new tricks. I bought one. It says refurbished or returned and I got it for 129.00 Looks absolutely brand new to my eyes.	  I took it to rehearsal 2 weeks ago. I plugged it in along side my trusty beta and sang a few bars into each acapella...... WOW. So much clarity and crispness from this Sennheiser. I have read reviews here that state that these sound bright or even tinny....... well adjust your EQ and you will be amazed. We did have to redial my mix a bit, but once we did the difference was so noticeable that our lead guitarist ordered one that very evening.	  My trusty Beta is now in my gig bag as back up. I am betting I will never need it. Sorry Shure....it was fun while it lasted.
0,Not much to say about a cowbell beater. The price was right, the quality is good and it does the job just fine.
0,good but a little to thick for me
0,Works well, as intended
0,Bought it as a gift for my kid and they love it. Good starter Ukelele. You will need to tune it frequently for the first month or so of ownership which I was told it common for Ukelele strings.
0,Item was just as advertised. Works great and inexpensive. Highly recommended.
0,a very good cleaner for nitro finish guitars. easily removes the haze where your arm rests on the instrument. no residue after use. discourages finger prints and dust. a little goes a long way. sometimes hard to get but is the best I've tried.
0,awsome
0,This thing is great! It's hard to figure out, but once you do you can get a wide range of guitar tones from it.
0,Would recommend for any guitar it gave my Taylor 214 a nice warm sound
0,great product
0,GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE HAVE USED THEM 3 OR 4 TIMES NOW AND OUR ONLY COMPLAINT WHICH IS MINOR IS HOW SENSITIVE THEY ARE TO SOUND. GREAT BUY THOUGH FOR ANY DJ OR FULL BAND.
0,works fine
0,Out of the box, one knob was not attached correctly, I gently lifted it off and reoriented it on the D-post and it slid on correctly. No problem.		I downloaded all the docs, presets and firmware. The latest firmware available is 1.10. When the unit is powered on, the display shows the current firmware version, which on my new BCR2000 is "1.10", so I'm all set there.		The computer editor software which runs in Java (multi-platform)  allows you to make all the MIDI assignments for each and every knob and button. It also let's you manage presets. I see import/export sysex functions in the file menu, which I suspect might allow you to update the firmware, but I did not test this.		Among the downloads was a sysex firmware update (1.10), and a Windows firmware updater. There was no Mac firmware updater. I do have the freeware SysEx Librarian for Mac which might work to update the firmware, but I didn't need to test this.		I tested all the knobs, buttons and functions using a MIDI monitor app and everything works fine.		I was impressed that all the controls respond very well, even with fast knob turns. I was also impressed at the number of configurations for the USB and MIDI IN and two MIDI outs. This makes it a very functional MIDI interface in addition to it's control functions.		I directly connected it to my iPad 4 using the CCK, and it recognized it immediately. I was quickly able to assign controls from the BCR2000 to control parameters in Animoog.		There are the concerns for reliability and durability with this product-- I bought the added protection, but it looks like I got a relatively flawless unit (apart from the very minor and easily fixed knob maneuver mentioned above).		I have had a 5-star experience, but took away one star because of my own experiences with Behringer's reliability and support. All potential buyers should consider the risk and adjust their expectations.
0,Good
0,Been using these for years. Still made like the used to be. Sound good, feel good!
0,I love this unique, shiny pink metal box! :)		Not much to say except that its fantastic,	SUPER CHEAP,	and worth it.		You can do gated sputter on this,	if you run an OD before it and crush it with signal.		It has a lot of Guitar Volume Knob possibilities as well.		BTW, not sure if this always happens,	but if you turn your tone knob all	the way down, it gives the sound a little	extra kick of soft nice grit.
0,All in all, I'm extremely happy with the PSA1.  It holds up my heavy Blue Yeti like a champ and generally stays put (see below).		I'd give it five stars if not for the annoying 3/8" thread which can be just a little bit finicky if you move your microphone to the wrong position, and don't have it tightened down.  About 5% of the time the springs also like to not stay where you put them, but that is a VERY minor complaint.  Once I get it set where I want it, and the springs behave themselves (again, maybe 5% of the time they twitch slightly), then it stays put.		Cable management leaves a little to be desired in that it's just some velcro straps, but they had to save costs somewhere.  I'd rather they save on "luxuries" like that than something important.		Base is rock solid.  Once you clamp that thing down it's not going *anywhere*.  I have a thin, beveled edge particle board desk, and it holds just fine.		All in all, if you're just getting into Let's Plays or podcasting, or announcing, or whatever requires you to sit and speak into a microphone, I would 100% recommend this stand.
0,I like the Remo PS3..It worked well for a kit that I had all Remo coated on and I wanted to stay consistant. With #SledgePad Alien and a KickPort on the front I'm getting a great sound through the PA.
0,The look of this strap caught my eye, I have a light colored natural look to my acoustic guitar and the blue complements it really well. The design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud. Strong build, sort of a double layered nylon strap, and nice thick leather for the ends(one end was actually pretty difficult to put on the guitar when still new, but it should be easier with some wear). Easy to adjust, comfortable. I think that with many things you get what you pay for, and this strap is definitely worth the added cost over the cheap kinds you can get.
0,GREAT VALUE
0,Good quality, well built. Good for home, perhaps not for stage as people might knock it over.
0,came fast - came well packed -  well made - very professional quality
0,cant beat it for the cost.
0,This is a large, heavy duty music stand. It has a small shelf so you can rest an open music book on it. The legs and riser fold so it can be stored or moved but it is probably a bit large and heavy to be considered portable without some sort of carrying bag.
0,Very Nice Strings
0,Surprised, did not expect such a good result, for such an economical product
0,Great piece
0,Great, decent tone and very functional
0,They loose their coating a bit too fast on the high strings with my sweaty hands, but keep their "tone" longer than the Slinkys. I like them.
0,Beautiful light strings that still have a rich full smooth boom and bright sound to them.  Great for Slap (something I personally don't like but more power to those who do) and fingering.  Great for my Arthritic fingers as well.  Fast shipping, great price and would buy them from this seller again.  Modern Amps can shape the sound so that light strings sound like fat strings or fingering sounds like slap.  James Jamerson rightly IMHO never gave into the slap crap.		Edit!  I'm NOT a pro and would never pretend to be one.  I don't work for Fender or Amazon.  Please grade these strings compared to other Flat wound LIGHT STRINGS!  Gosh, saying they don't give a certain sound like Motown is kind of wild.  James Jamerson used FAT 115's and a Mute (sponge like thingy) these get a 5 star rating for sounding like how LIGHT STRINGS should sound LOL!		[...]		Don't call on a light weight when you need a heavy.  All Bass guitars don't like heavy or light strings.  The Jackson Charvel bass I installed these on is a nice fit for my uses.  60's & 70's Soul and Classic Rock.
0,Best replacement violin tailpiece available, I have an old (1939 ) violin that I have refitted with strings, tailpiece and bridge. When I got it, the violin was broken and unplayable. After I put perfection type tuners on it, I think repairs will be complete.
0,This pedal is great !  Not so sensitive that it gets crappy in a hurry. Works very well with my Tele and Fender amp.
0,No its not a Meyer or Brilhardt but for the price it's a super mouthpiece.  Works very well with Rico jazz reeds. I recommend.
0,Does the job at a great price.
0,Nice light, very well built. Nice hard plastic. Wide angle lense perfect for mirror ball. Downsides is no dmx. Really but turn down for me, dmx makes everything better.
0,These have been my go to Drumstick for over 5 years.		I used to play with 7A's but when I tried these I loved them since then.		They give me the reach I need and also the weight that I want when playing from Metal to Latin music.		They produce a bright sound on the cymbals, some people like it some people don't.		I highly recommend the 5A's, they feel great in my hands and if you need something with a little bit more reach give these ones a try!
0,It is only 3W and it never get warn, can you believe it!	I have 2 of them. I use the 6 degree len about 20 ft away to the 16" mirror ball from 2 defferent angle. The result is so good! It shines the whole room 8000 sq ft and 18' ceiling. Amazing!
0,I've been using these for years.  Great picks.  They seem to wear out a little slower than other brands.
0,This is a great little delay pedal. I only use delay to fatten my lead tone during solos and the 500ms of delay this pedal provides does the job perfectly. I would have happily paid twice as much for this pedal and still come out cheaper than buying a Boss or Digitech. It feels really sturdy and it takes up very little room on my pedal board.
0,works as promised.
0,Still the best.
0,I have been using this product for over two years and have had no problems.  I do not need/use most of the options available.  I guess my ears just do not distinguish all of the differences that are possible.  If you want that it is there for you.  I tweeked a handful of presets and have not explore further.  The sound is great and set to my needs.  The only challenge for me was learning how to apply the settings.  My ears guided me rather than the understanding of what was being done theoretically.  Not sure why the cost has incresaed.
0,Excellent Knobs !  They worked for me.  Great fit for my ESP LTD	I would buy again...
0,Very nice strings, easy on the fingers. Not quite as smooth as silk& steel but much brighter tone and better string life. If you like to bend a note or two these (16002 extra light) are the strings for you. I've had a set on an ovation balladeer for about 3 months now and they still sound pretty pristine. Ring like a bell and bend like putty, they are quite pleasant to play and the tone with this guitar is gorgeous.		I would recommend these strings to anyone playing acoustic guitar. They are a bit more expensive, but they don't need to be changed as often which saves some hassle and who doesn't need less hassle in their lives?	They also sound nice amplified, so if you want to record or play live they are up to  the task.		I am not employed by Elixir or W.L. Gore, but i would be willing to accept a case or two of these fine strings.....
0,Works as it should, no issues.
0,I had bought this item with the intention of putting it on my Hercules Music Stand.  Well it's apparently only intended to work on mic stands.  The Hercules Music stand BS301B takedown model has a larger diameter pole than the mic stand does.  It is more like 3/4" so the adapter is too small to fit over the tube.		My intention was to use this adapter to secure an Air Turn Manos mount for my Android Tablet.  This mount uses a standard threaded mic attachment.  I'm not crazy about using other kinds of short boom attachment/extensions for the for fear that the weight may make my 13 tablet slide down the tube and they just look a bit gaudy.		Too bad Hercules didn't go all the way and make an adapter for their own music stands.  So iI decided to keep this adapter anyway as it is still handy on the microphone side and will fit most mic stand tubes.
0,Bought these to mute string buzz above the nut sometimes & as a "below the nut" string overtone killer. They are easy to use & work great.
0,It does what it's supposed to do for cheap.
0,I bought this unit from a music store, but wanted to share my experience with it since Amazon sells this unit and similar units.		In connecting a guitar to a regular guitar amplifier, there is an issue with the cable length. As the cable gets longer and longer, more capacitance is added within the cable, and it has the effect of rolling off the high frequencies of the guitar. This is due to the fact that the guitar pickups have a high impedance of about 500 K ohms to 1 Meg ohms (that's 500,000 to 1,000,000 ohms). Ohms are a measure of DC or AC resistance. With this situation, the guitar cables capacitive impedance is close to the pickups impedance level, and the two together act like a filter, filtering out some of the high frequencies.		If your guitar cable length is less than about 16 feet you will not notice much effect. Longer than that and the cable will start to affect your signal. I use a 10 or 12 foot cable attached to this box and I will explain what this unit does.		The Twin City ABY switch has inside, an electronic impedance converter, which takes the 500 k ohms impedance of the pickups and electronically lowers it to about 5 k ohms (100x lower). The capacitance of the cable now has 1/100 of the effect that it had before. So you can drive a longer cable, say 25 to 50 feet, without having the roll off problems. Also, because the impedance of the long cable from this box to your amp is lowered, it is less susceptible to pickup from nearby sources. It will NOT however, do anything for the hum pickup issue with single coil pickups.		The next problem the guitarist faces is when he wants to connect the guitar to two amps at the same time. Perhaps to switch between them for Lead and Rhythm or maybe to play both at the same time for other effects. Many pros do this kind of thing. Neil Young used two old Fender Deluxe amps,  one set up dirty and one set up clean, and he played them both at the same time. The Twin City box allows both of these actions to be done and does it correctly.		The issue here, is when you connect your guitar to two amps you are also connecting the inputs of the two amps together. Remember that a guitar amp has a sensitive input with lots of gain, and therefore is susceptible to ground loops and hum pickup. The Twin City ABY switch uses an audio transformer on the 'B' output to isolate the 'B' amplifier from the input of the 'A' amplifier. Not only does this eliminate hum problems most of the time, but also helps to guard against a minor shock hazard which could occur due to different voltage levels within the two amps. If one of your amps is a tube amp, I would connect that one to the 'B' output.		The unit has a few more features. On the top there are two switches. One reverses the polarity of the signal to the 'B' amplifier in case the two amps are out of phase. You might remember when hooking up the speakers on your home stereo, you had to go thru a similar exercise with the + and - leads, connecting them whichever way gave the most Bass sound. Same thing here. The other switch lifts the ground on one of the outputs which may help hum problems in some cases.		Lastly, the unit has a variable control called 'Drag' that adjusts the impedance the box presents to your guitar. This is used in the case where the guitar is a little too bright now, with most of the cable capacitance out of the picture. You can vary this control to tune the sound a little to your preference.		I was concerned that this unit might change the sound of my expensive guitars. The transformer inside had a model number so I looked it up. Turns out that it has a very wide frequency range, well past the range of the guitars, so it will not roll off the guitars output either on the low or high side, and the response is ruler flat. The impedance converter uses a discrete class A amplifier, basically a individual Bipolar or JFet transistor device, which is similar to the one inside of most quality amplifiers.		My listening tests show that there is no audible difference when this box is connected between my guitar and amp compared to when it is removed and it made connecting my guitar to two amps simple. Note that this box does not have any gain.		The Twin City is a little expensive when compared to units that just passively switch between the two amps, but many times those kind of switching units don't work correctly. Consider that you will add cable length when any switch is placed between your guitar and Amp(s). After studying this whole situation, I decided to spend the money and try this Radial unit. I am happy with it and feel it was worth the extra expense. It is also built very well.		You will need a regulated AC to DC adapter to power this unit. It can operate between 9 and 12 volts DC and has the + side of the voltage on the outer shell of the barrel connector and the - side of the voltage on the center conductor of the barrel connector.

0,Bought the 60th Anniversary Fender Strat Guitar, so it was only right to get this.  Pretty fancy looking!  Haven't used it yet.  UPDATE:  The cappo is really nice and works perfectly!  Would fit any Fender guitar.
0,Seems to be made well, length was perfect for my application and there have been no problems with functionality or connectivity using the cable.  These make great and affordable mic cables.  Not much else to say, it works and looks well made.  Definitely recommend it.
0,Its a good tuner but you cannot see it in the sun, at all. Like the early TC pedal tuners it's not ready for outside work during the day. Otherwise I have no complaints.
0,Great for drop tuning.
0,Feels great on short duration so far. Its heavy duty and soft as advertised. Thinking I might need strap locks to secure on pegs though.
0,I've been playing guitar for over 45 years going through so many acoustic strings. I just happened to be most comfortable and confident with Martin strings. These particular strings however I've found the ultimate balance in tone, volume and playability. Can play for hours with these strings in any setting.
0,have several 4 my guitar so I tried one  4 bass love it !!!
0,this is so easy, i use it with ADJ par 64 go pars. its easy and does everything you would ever need. this is a great purchase to add to your uplighting so. its very quick to setup and take down.
0,When I bought these I was hoping for the sharper version of this one they make as I had kept one from a music store after using it and wanted some more after the store made me stop keeping them when I took the whole jar.  I have since gotten used to these and will probably get them again if I ever run out.  They show up everywhere, so I don't think I'll run out any time soon. I can't with certainty say that there were 72 in the package; I was trying to count them when they arrived but I was doing a math test at the same time and kept losing my place.		One tip to those thinking of buying these I would get a bag or some other container because a pile of 72 picks is not really easy to manage neatly.  Another thing you could do is get about 6 feet of gaff tape and tape them all to something so you could grab one if you drop the one you're using, or toss one like an idiot to the audience if you are playing in front of one (or think you are).		These are perfect for what I like to call "picking the strings of a guitar."  They are made in the USA (USA! USA! USA!) and are made from ultex, which is similar to elephant ivory but from a rhinoceros which I found out after seeing the image on the pick.		5 thumbs up for the Dunlops!
0,this pyle pro phe400 hum/noise eliminator actually works.... ran this unit with xlr connections just before the amplifier.... it did take out the ground hum that i did have in this system...  the unit is built together very well.... the connections are tight and snug... why should you spend more on other name brands when you can get the same results....
0,Excellent especially for the price. better get before price goes up
0,Works great I like the way it is just
0,Amazing pick for any fans of Dunlop Jazz picks.
0,This is a nice interface for beginners looking to review your own sound or mixing tracks. It's easy to download the software for Mac, PC, or iPad. Although, the 1 channel is nice, I think you are better off getting the 2 channel just to have more options. You would get 2 instrument inputs and mic input instead of just one instrument and mic input. The Presonus is comparable to the Focusrite and gets the job done. I love having the ability to produce and edit my own music. This particular interface is ideal for those who have an Ipad. You don't even need to have a PC to produce, edit, etc., because you can convert your tracks into Garageband.
0,This unit is very user friendly and will definitely enhance your sound. I used another unit for monitors. I decided to return this unit for the PA version to have the ability to upload updates.
0,Cheap way to get away from the straight stand.  Works good. I bought two!
0,Long time user of .009 and .010 gauge electric guitar strings for heavy metal music.  I picked these up for a Jackson 7-String guitar and they sound great.  D'Addario has never steered me wrong.  I use them on all of my guitars (electrics, acoustics, 12-string, bass).
0,Excellent pots for push/pull guitar switch wiring.  Highly recommended.
0,DI helps a lot protecting our mixer and giving the intstruments (guitar, bass, keyboard) a more clear and live sound.  Also helps increase volume in some cases.
0,I started playing Rocksmith on a PS3 and needed a cable with a right angle so I can sit on the couch and rock out.  This works well for this.  You will need a 1/4 female to 1/4 female connector to connect this to your rocksmith realtone cable, or run this to a mixer then take a line output from the mixer to the real tone cable.
0,Great strings, I wouldn't use another brand. They sound great and last well.
0,The strings are very good. Usually you have a lot of problems with "stretching" when you first get the strings. I didn't have very much if any at all when I got these strings. The sound is superb and they stay in tune very well. I highly recommend these strings.
0,Does what it says it should do. I have a 12 inch disco ball and it works just fine. Great product.
0,I bought this guitar after much searching for the right guitar for a beginner.	I have been taking lessons for about 4 months now, and am very satisfied.	This guitar was $94, and plays, and sounds like one of twice that value. Perfect for a beginner.  I like it because it is slightly smaller than a dreadnought which makes it easer for a beginner to control.	I recommend it for the TRUE BEGINNER that don't know ANYTHING about guitars, and whether they will still want to continue to play after about 3 months. So, if you stop you have only spent $100.  I was in that group. On the other hand,  if you have some experience, and KNOW that you will continue go ahead, and spend $200 - $400 on something like a nice acoustic, or acoustic electric. Yamaha would be my recommendation for that group after endless research into the LESS THAN $1000 guitars. (you may have a different opinion if you are an experienced player)	The only negative remark that I can make about this guitar is that the top string (number 6, E string) is a bit muddy which is to be expected in a cheap guitar. Not so muddy that it matters most of the time, but a little muddy.
0,After a lifetime of $10.00 dynamic Radio Shack mics, the time was right for a semi-"pro" mic. I wanted a condenser and still have money for, oh, I don't know, food, maybe? The MXL series fit the bill perfectly. The 990 is simply amazing. I already had a preamp with 48V phantom power. The included shockmount gives my bedroom studio a professional look....but more important, a professional sound. The mic is very sensitive. It actually picked up me walking in my socks on carpeted floor. My vocalist sounds so clear and pristine. If you got a few hundred to spend on a mic then by all means do so. But if you're on a tight budget and need a pro performing mic, you cannot go wrong with this one. The 990 rocks.
0,Cow bell is great, tambo is niceee. Overall a good buy.
0,As I expected, a rubber piece to cover the guitar hole.
0,Works fine. Nothing special. But it does pull the pins out pretty good.
0,Pretty good guitar. I had to change the strings though, they weren't very good. and the action is so high??? idk why its so ridiculously high, but ill be shaving down the bridge when i get some sand paper. everything besides that is great though.
0,Love these picks! Just the right amount of flex and easy to hang on to.
0,Great piece of gear. Great price. Quick delivery. Thanks.
0,I love this bass. It looks beautiful and has an iconic vintage look to it. I love that its all maple, which makes it unique for this price range (and heavy). Of course it sounds and plays great too.
0,Love these cable's. They look like they will last forever.
0,Reliable, heats up fairly quickly, and puts out a great volume of fog. MORE than enough for most any small- to medium-large-sized indoor venues.		If you have a light setup that you're trying to really make pop, get a fog machine. And if you're going to get a fog machine, get this bad boy. You won't regret it.
0,good cables for the price
0,Great addition to my blackedout guitar build.
0,Been having trouble tuning my bass with the Korg table tops. This thing is accurate and responsive. More responsive than plugging into the Korg. After such good success with the electric bass the boy borrowed it for his acoustic guitar and it worked even better. If anything a little too sensitive for the acoustic. Once again truly Tight Bright and Fast.
0,Much better strap than some of the more expensive over-the-head straps; very adjustable, and supports the uke. A good solution for a uke without an end peg
0,I just started playing guitar and realized that I needed a capo to play all of the songs that I really wanted to play. This one was a fair price and the quality is great. It arrived in short amount of time and seems indestructible. I wasn't sure that I would be as great as it seemed but when I clamped it down it was perfect.
0,This is a great leather strap. It's nice-looking and well made. It's good quality leather. It's advertised as a "junior" size, but it works well for me with an electric guitar. I have it set at its longest size and it measures 50 1/2 inches. So if you don't need a really long strap then this size might work for you. It's made by Levy, so you know it is quality. It's really comfortable and did I mention how nice it looks, also?  I got it on sale so it was really an outstanding buy. If the length will fit your needs then I'd say get one.
0,Beautiful, crisp, clean gain for my Shure SM7B. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to maintain their levels without blowing them out.
0,The title says it all.  I got it for $16 (free shipping with Amazon Prime), which is cheaper than my local music store.  I keep it on the head of the guitar, and it is easy to add, move, remove.  With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used.  It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  And best of all... it works!
0,I've had a few amps in my time and this is definitely at the top of the list for my acoustic/electric. Excellent sound, many connection options. Have it piped into my church's sound system. Major difference between my old and new setup and this one is by far much better.
0,Excellent product. Local stores sell this for about $15-17. Construction is solid compared to previous string winders I've had. I've actually used this to cut zip ties too! Try this one before getting the $3 plastic one.
0,I recommend it, good as all Vandoren
0,Works great with the new Hamilton stand we bought.  Much less difficult to carry the stand with this bag.
0,I wanted a noise reducer because I have like 10 pedals and the loud feedback I was getting back through them was insane. I got this one because it wa cheaper and basically thinking why not? It's like $25. It was a great choice. The pedal stops nearly all unwanted feedback and doesn't alter your tone. It does take some time to figure it out but after that its golden. It's great.
0,I have bought the 76 keys version for my other keyboards and the fit is just right and it does what it is supposed to do. But when I got an 88 keys version for my Yamaha P95 digital piano, the cover is too big for the keyboard. It would be perfect for a yamaha DGX640 or a Motif XF8. The product picture is somehow deceiving.		*********	Update	*********		Now I have a Yamaha P155 and this cover is great for it. I can even cover my digital piano with the music rest in place. That is cool. It is still a bit large for a P95 and a privia sized piano.
0,This tuner is very easy to use and is a lot more durable than other clip-on tuners I have tried such as Korg and Snark which both broke after falling 18 inches from my couch to my hardwood floor. I've also dropped this one and so far it is still functioning flawlessly.
0,As a loyal Vic Firth customer for the past 21 years (I have literally only played with one pair of non-VF in 21 years), it pains me to only give the Dave Weckl Evolution sticks four stars.		I purchased my original pair about a year ago to use for a couple of jazz/big bands that I perform with and have really liked them.  Light weight, good rebound, nice sound that isn't too bright for more mellow music.  Only reason I purchased my second pair was as back-ups in-case the first pair broke during a rehearsal or performance.		While the first pair have held up very well, especially with rim shots or knocks, this new pair had paint chipping off during the very first song.  I only have one drum set, and I haven't changed out my rim or heads in the past year, so the only difference is the sticks.		I have since purchased a pair of VF Modern Jazz MJC1s to try as replacements.  They just arrived so I haven't had a chance to try them out yet.
0,I got this so I could record guitar riffs through my Digital Audio Workstation software (Reaper.fm).
0,good pickguard.  i wish they made a fender mustang pickguard for humbucker configuration
0,These are good mounting screws. They are a bit long for my needs, but they worked fine.
0,This is a well made item. It makes a Precision Bass look the way it was originally made.	The only disappointment is that it doesnt come with mounting screws. Pick guard screws or #6X1/2 oval head sheet metal screws do the job.
0,Had mine for years and its never failed me (didn't get it here) and I paid double the asking price. If you need a tuner, get this one. Its always spot on!
0,Lot easy on neck than one that came with saxophone.
0,I love you Ernie Ball, you are the one true great string in the land full of gimmicks, tinctures, potions and tonics!
0,We opted for the World Tour "Guitar Gig Bag" over a hard case because most of the time my son's guitar is hanging on the wall using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/String-Swing-Hardwood-Home-Studio-Guitar-Hanger-Shades-May-Vary/dp/B0002GLCRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">String Swing Hardwood Home & Studio Guitar Hanger (Shades May Vary)</a>. This case is generally good quality and meets our needs, with the following observations:		Pros -	+ Lightweight; doesn't add a lot of pounds but still protects the guitar	+ Good Quality; strong material, stitching, and zippers	+ Storage Pockets; big enough for music pages, picks, and a small electronic tuner	+ Handles; good hand grip handle on the side and has well padded adjustable packpack straps		Cons -	- Limited Protection; this is not a hard case and it will not provide much protection from a serious impact	- Appearance; this is not awe-inspiring to look at, being very basic and the "World Tour" logo looks a little "cheesy"		This was a good choice for the limited, light use it gets from us.		Recommended!		CFH
0,Nice, very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!
0,Faces your amp at about ear level if your audience is level with you, or faces your ear if pointed directly at you. Good for small combos only, I don't think I would go over 1x12" speaker with it. Make sure the back of your amp will support it and that the uprights don't interfere with anything that you need to get to ie:  jacks or plugs. Should be steady as long as you don't put anything too big on it.
0,Very well made. Works well.
0,I recently bought an Epiphone dot and was looking for a protective gig bag that fit and offered sufficient protection. This bag does the trick. It is not one of those flimsy gig bags. This gives good protection and includes comfortable back pack straps as well as convenient handles. I also appreciate the pocket space. I am happy to have it protecting my guitar.
0,Very nice, inexpensive little capo.  Works well for me.  Very lightweight.
0,The package where they came on was a little smashed but, they were perfect!
0,as advertised
0,well worth the money.
0,great tuner responds well to my guitar and bass and is well lit and I like that you have to hold the button in for a sec to turn on. that way it doesn't get turned on in my gig bag like others... Great price and will order a couple more.
0,I have a Don Pablo Cuban guitar, made in 1969,, for a few months,,, never change the strings,, and sounds great,,, I put this strings,, and wao,,know sounds wonderful,, few guitarist fellows could not believe the sound of the guitar after the string change,, try,, this are the best
0,Good strings for Fender guitars.
0,Bought it for the vibrato since I can't afford a vintage BOSS but the chorus is very usable and saves up space on the pedal board.  Seems very solid and hasn't caused me a problem.  I like the speed range.  Only wish it had the ability to change speed w/exp pedal.  I think it was a very good price as well, cheaper than the music superstores.		I'd recommend to anyone looking for a true vibrato (not tremolo) and you get a pretty nice chorus to boot.
0,Sturdy and not cheap feeling, takes good beatings. Very pleased with my purchase
0,It works as it should, and fast delievery.	Not much more you can say. It works	I would recommend this Gooseneck.	W
0,Works well for playing guitar at home. Nice price too!
0,Great Product, Great Seller!
0,Did not like these at first but they grew on me. Very smooth & last a long time. No string is perfect for every guitar, but I like these on most acoustics.
0,best Strings!
0,Very good stand. Sturdy and padding protects my guitars. No chance of guitar falling off.
0,A little thin for great protection, but generally OK for light use. Great price, though.
0,Good quality cables. They do what they're supposed to do.
0,Nice quality
0,Great product. Small with lots of power.
0,I LOVE IT
0,This amp is defiantly a keeper. wonderful sound out of a solid state amp. i could go on and on about how amazing it is but youll find that out on your own if you get the amp so instead ill start with the cons. there's not a lot but some worth knowing.	first, this amp is pretty hefty. Line 6 couldve given you a bit more then a single handle to haul this thing around. perhaps some handle bars on the left and right side of the amp would be more efficient.	Next, the interface could be a little more user friendly. I figured it out on my own but i can imagine some people would really struggle to grasp how to function it. not a huge deal but still...	Thats about all the cons i can really think of at the moment. I just bought it so ill have to see if it stands the test of time. But i couldn't be happier right now. It even has very accurate built in tuner. Also the song presets are simply a blast. I spent about an hour scrolling through all of them saying things like "hey! johnny b good! i love that song! oh cool gimme shelter by the stones!!" and they all sound very accurate to the studio recordings they are mimicking.	If your looking for an amp thatll cover any live performance just short of a giant professional show involving a crowd of thousands of people then thisll will do the trick. (if your playing for that many people then you can afford a bigger amp anyway.) This amp will drown out a drummer if you get the 120wt version that i have.	In terms of price this just cant be beat either. 120 wts and i got it used for 300$. thats simply an amazing deal with all the awesome gadgets you get with this.	One last note though, I highly recommend getting the footpedal with it. this way you can use the loopinig feature, tuner, and presets without having to stoop down and change the settings by hand. especially the looping feature. in fact there's no way to really use the looping feature without the pedal so go for the footpedal and you'll thank yourself.	Once again... get this amp!
0,I'm an experienced bass player with nice vintage basses. I needed a decent guitar for songwriting and recording purposes in my home studio. I've always had a low opinion of Squier instruments and never considered buying one until now. I have no other Telecaster experience to compare this to, but it's a well-built guitar. No blemishes that I can find, and it arrived with a good setup. I'll probably replace the pickups but it suits me just fine for now. It's become one of my favorite guitars next to my Ibanez Iceman.
0,How Fender, or any guitar company, gets away with charging so much for a piece of plastic is beyond me.  But at almost half retail price on amazon.  I am pretty happy.  Its a real Fender product, arrived in retail packaging.		Kinda irrelevant but it may help someone. I got this for a non-fender custom telecaster.  It is a Logan custom tele to be exact.  Well, Logan puts Allparts pickguards on his guitars.  So to be sure this would fit I took my Allparts pickguard to the local music shop and lined it up with a fender pickguard to make sure the holes lined up.  Well, the holes lined up and all looked good so I came home and ordered this fender pickguard.  When the pickguard arrived I immediately installed it and found out that the (little half-circle shaped cutout that goes around the chrome control plate on a tele) was slightly off by a few millimeters and would not fit.  After some filing and sanding I got it on there.		Moral of the story, if you are replacing a Fender pickguard, then buy a Fender pickguard.  If your replacing an Allparts pickguard, then yes you guessed it, buy an Allparts pickguard.
0,Love these. Q&A Mics match color on glow sticks. Sound tech can tell what mic is up next - visually.
0,Looks great on my sons fender acustic!  Was easy to put on
0,Mackie has feature found in pricey boards. Great for a personal main mix monitor board.
0,I really like this thing. It's not a full blown professional workbench, but I bet its the next best thing. I love it.
0,This ia a nice pocket size basic metronome. Serves the purpose and well worth the money,
0,really nice and good price.
0,As a complete beginner to the bodhrn, I didn't know one tipper from another.  I chose this one based on another positive review, and it just made sense to me that this style would be a good one - oval cross section in the grip area, raised areas towards the ends for reference, and somewhat smaller knobs as compared with the tipper that came with my drum.  A rubber band tied around the center of any tipper can go far towards preventing slipping while also giving a changeable "set point" (credit to Michelle Stewart for this great idea).  I can recommend this tipper without reservations.  I would only add that, while a good fit and comfortable, this tipper doesn't noticeably improve my playing.  I feel sure there are many excellent tippers and that ultimately it's just a matter of finding what works best for you.  [Later note: I bought a second one of these which was also very nice but does not have the oval cross section - not a deal breaker but good to know.]
0,Disclaimer:  I am NOT a mandolin player, yet.  I have, however, been playing drums, guitar and bass for 40+ years and have been playing, repairing, trading and buying guitars and other instruments just as long.		This mandolin was delivered via FedEx today.  It came in a cardboard box and inside the box it had some foam wrapped around it, and just a wee bit of packing material.  Although I though it should be packed a little better, there was absolutely no damage, so can't knock that part.  As for the mandolin itself, it's beautifully crafted for the price.  I loosened the strings to take out the foam under the saddle and tuned it up using the strings that came installed.  It tuned right up and the action looked perfect from the start.  I then plugged it into my Presonus StudioLive and added a little touch of reverb.  Right from the start it sounded beautiful to me.  I then proceeded to learn the obvious "Losing My Religion" by REM to see what it sounded like, and I couldn't be happier with this.  I am well-aware there are better and more expensive mandos out there, but this price is perfect for me to lug this around with my acoustic act to play 3 or 4 tunes and get that WOW factor.  Do not hesitate to pick this up for the money.  For $168 + Free Shipping I'd hang it on the wall for that price even if I couldn't play it!
0,Nice stuff, well machined and very useful.  I'm going over mine with super fine sandpaper, melting the sharp edges and putting a nice finish on it, just because.  Well worth the price, and a very useful basic luthier tool.
0,This Uke strap is great!  I love that I don't have to have the strap slung around my neck, as I have a spinal injury that makes that position painful.  I'd like the strap to be a bit longer, as I am a large fella, but it's big enough to get by.  Easy to use, inexpensive, comfortable, holds the uke well, and looks great!!  Can't think of anything else, except that I will be buying another one to keep at my girlfriend's house.
0,nice looking bolts, all a perfect match just as pictured, I really like these hook bolts.
0,These are beautiful, well made, and awesome pro gear.  Just the thing for holding up some pretty QSC's or whatever...  Expensive, but worth it.  Nice gas strut lift.  I'll post back if they fail, but they seem like the real deal, love the look and feel so far.
0,This thing takes a ton of the weight off of my Agile 3100 electric guitar, which weighs a ton. I used to have some discomfort after strapping the guitar on for less than an hour with my old strap. This strap has no issue distributing the weight of the instrument, and makes it feel a lot lighter. Money well spent in my opinion.
0,It works, what more is there to say
0,This is used to set up the microphone in variable positions to use it for spokent word audio, room sound audio, and it can be used outside the front door to listen to outside activity.
0,<div id="video-block-RK86WFGYRZXQH" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1NsFok%2BcMS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UIAuGXHuS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;It was 1961 and I was in the chorus to perform Bach's Christmas Oratorio at the National Cathedral in Washington DC. We had a recording pro on hand with all of his equipment including a big Neumann condenser microphone. As it happened a friend of mine in the bass section also had his own Neumann microphone. They thought they would try to record in stereo - a new technology then.		Somehow my friend managed to lose it in the Cathedral. He was one unhappy camper. His mic cost $800 - in those days that was real money.		He got his mic back but it made an indelible impression on me. I wanted a condenser mic in much the way that I wanted a Ferrari.		Over the years I did a bit of live recording (I had my own opera company) with dynamic mics and electret mics. About five years ago I gave away all my long XLR balanced cables. Now I only record at home into my computer using a variety of inexpensive mics. I wanted a mic that was good enough for music and also appropriate for the spoken voice.		I used to have my own radio show in college so I have some idea about voice over and vlogging techniques. I knew that some mics were more flattering to the low male voice because of the proximity effect. The same kind of condenser mics that hang over orchestras also sit on radio station desks. And classical singers benefit from a frequency response bump around 3KHz - near the singer's formant.		One of new Chinese reverse engineered Neumann condenser designs seemed perfect. One contender was the Audio Technica 2020. This mic is inexpensive and gets good reviews but it isn't a "real" condenser but rather an electret condenser. I don't know exactly what the difference in sound is. I do know that electrets have long had an advantage over the original condenser mics in that they don't need external power. But this advantage means nothing for a USB connected mic because it can get its power from the USB cable. I decided to pass on the 2020. Maybe I was wrong.		Some experts here testify that an MXL or Samson condenser is not as good as the Neumann original. What a surprise! A $100 mic isn't as good as a $1,000 mic. Imagine that!		I chose the Samson G Track first of all because it's USB. I have a USB external sound board which I like very much. I don't want to ever fool with mixers and XLR balanced cables again. If I had to record in a cathedral again I would hire someone who already had all that stuff. For my domestic recording efforts I wanted simplicity. Balanced lines are just meaningless extra trouble if you don't need long cable runs.		I ordered the G-Track Wednesday. It came this Friday morning. I unpacked it and plugged it in to my new Windows 7 64bit PC. I adjusted the default mic assignment in the Control Panel and recorded some tests in Audio Studio (Sound Forge). No problems what so ever. I suspect that the poster who couldn't get this mic to work with Win 7 simply didn't know how to use the new Windows Control Panel. It can be confusing.		I'm going to try to post a video comparing this mic with a couple others. I initial reaction is very favorable but I'll reserve final judgement until I've been able to conduct some tests.		I loaded the Sonar LE software but I may erase it. I use another MIDI package (SmartScore X) and another recording package (Sony Sound Forge/Audio Studio). It's not clear to me what Cakewalk/Sonar will give to me that I don't already have.		I didn't get the rubber band cradle or the pop filter. So far I don't see (hear) the need for them.
0,Very happy with purchase. Nice that it adjusts to the thickness of uku too.
0,This ADJUSTRITE Musician's Chair by Vivo USA is built to last a long time.  It is very solid and steady.  There is a slight trick to learn when unfolding it, and folding it up again, but it folds very compactly. Then it can be put away somewhere.  This is very convenient when space is limited.		The seat cushion itself was not comfortable for me because the comfort foam did not conform well.  However, I just put an inexpensive pillow on it, and it now works well.  And the other qualities of the chair outweigh this drawback.
0,EHX came out with four or five very good distortion pedals all at about the same price. I listened to all the demos on their website, and picked this one, I absolutely love it, makes my pair of stereo solid state Roland amps sound very tube like. Very good product.
0,Just as advertised.
0,These are the only picks I will use. I have been using them for years. Sliding does nick the edges though. That's when I toss them away. But I but them in bulk and always have plenty.
0,Great product and seller!
0,Such a fun instrument! Purchased this as a gift for my musical brother and we had the best time playing with it. Sturdy and well made, good for musicians of any level, beginner to pro!
0,This is my second furman strip. For some reason the length of the cord has been cut almost in half????? Otherwise great units.
0,I am pleased with these jumpers. They are sturdy, solid and made well. The price was right and I will probably have to get a few more for my music set up. Thanks.
0,I have been using D'Addario EXL110-3D Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings at least 17 years.  I have only broken maybe 3 strings ever onstage with these strings and they are in a price range that I can change my strings often.  I used to change my strings ever gig for 15 years...  now I change them ever two or three... lol... D'Addario for ever...  I have enough points to buy a new guitar or something by now.. ha.. Gregory C. Ford  peace
0,very high-quality sound. I am impressed with the volume that comes from such a small tambourine.
0,I use an Alesis Mic Link Digital Wireless Adapter. It's basically a receiver unit coupled with a sender unit that plugs directly into any standard (non phantom-powered) XLR mic.  The only issue is the receiver unit uses a TRS output connector which doesn't work well in live applications with long XLR runs.  Basically, you'll get a lot of hum.  This Behringer unit solved my problem and it fits nicely into my gig bag when I need it in a pinch. IMHO *all* live musicians should carry this just in case you're in my situation OR you have an instrument with no XLR level outputs and need to plug it into house sound.  Sound guys will LOVE you if you whip one of these out!
0,I"ll give it 5 Stars because it does what I need. It's cheap, fits well, and provides sufficient protection for my not-so-valuable guitar. The storage pocket will fit a strap, cable, and extra strings, but not much else. Again--all I need. If you are going to include stomp boxes and/or a 6-pack and a sandwich-- get a gig bag with more pockets. If you are going to put your $10K vintage Strat in it and hand it off to your roadies or airline baggage porters.invest in something bullet proof. I do a reasonable amount of gigging and have a few of these, but I carry my own stuff and they do the job.
0,I own four ukes.  They range from $50 to $300. Three different brands. Different sizes.  I love each one of them. They serve different purposes. I have researched ukes obsessively. I am convinced this uke is the best value for under $200 in the non-solid top wood class.	Here is some advice to help narrow down your search: If you are set on concert size, be sure to look at the specs on the companies website. Not alll concerts have the same number of frets, for example. Even within Oscar Schmidt concerts, they make them between 16 & 19. I bought this model because it has 16 frets, which is a little shorter than others. My main uke is a 19 fret Kala solid wood Tenor. I wanted a uke with a smaller body(concert) AND a shorter fret board. Good luck.		PS- Kala's website has the best layout of specs. I learned a lot about differences of ukes in general by snooping around their site.
0,The Hohner Blues Harp is my favorite Hohner model. It's easy to play single notes, bend and do chords, and holds up very well. I think I have nine in different keys and they are all just fine.
0,Great whistle and good instructions. Wonderful pastime.
0,This is a great stand for a good price.  My favorite A-frame stands from Kamen are no longer made.  This is a good substitute for considerably less cost.  Works equally well for electric or acoustic too.
0,Lasted almost three months and still sounding good.  Play it almost everyday for at least an hour, often more.  First time using coated strings so wasn't sure how kong is longer.  I'm satisfied and love not having to change my strings every month.
0,be mindful that this clip is for thin music books. Works well for sheet music that you print yourself, or hand-write.
0,It's seem like they are working well.
0,There is no shortage of "Tubescreamer clones" on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues, jazz, and rock.  The DigiTech Bad Monkey is one such example.  But the Chinese-made Joyo JF-01 Vintage Distortion just be the best, and it's half the price of a TS-9.		About the manufacturer - Joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor (very similar to an MXR in size and switch) but "cloning" the circuitry of well-known classic and modern boutique effects pedals.  Some people jump to conclusions about Chinese products, but don't just take it from me - do your homework.  The response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive, and there are great vendors/distributors within the U.S. that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days.  I'm definitely a fan of Joyo products.		As for the "Vintage Distortion" itself, people have said it's based on either a TS-9 or the (more expensive) TS-808.  Frankly, while the latter is apparently warmer (and less mid-range heavy) than the former, I'm not sure there's any significant difference.  I played this JF-01 side by side with my TS-9, and it's probably one of the more exact "clones" in the Joyo lineup.  For example, the Joyo "Ultimate Drive" is an excellent (higher-gain) overdrive pedal based on a Fulltone OCD, but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there (some of which are arguably BETTER than the original).  With the settings matched, the JF-01 performed almost exactly like the TS-9 in level, gain, and tone.  There probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full, which isn't a bad thing.  It's very responsive to your playing style and, again, it sounds like a Tubescreamer.		I'll probably be keeping my Tubescreamer, if only because it's an iconic pedal that performs well.  But it's superior in name only - if I had to use the Joyo Vintage Overdrive in its place, I'd be no worse for the wear.  5 stars, highly recommended!
0,The Hill rosin will be perfect for one of the new bows in the case.  Because of my travels from one side of the United States to the other, different weather conditions may cause one rosin to be used in lieu of another.
0,Love Them
0,Works great for me.  It is sturdy like it says isn't the name, the rubber is grippy, just a little stubborn when it comes to folding up and setting up.
0,Good product..!
0,Just as advertised.
0,Simply the best.  The feeling and sound of new strings! True Love at last!
0,I Like It good sound, reasonably priced
0,The 3-pack is a FANTASTIC deal. I've been around mics under $100 for 30 years, and when compared to other mics in the $50-$100 range, they are as good or better! Good lows and clean highs without ANY hiss. Absolutely NO whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp. Don't miss out on this GREAT deal.
0,Before I used this head, I used the Evans reverse dot head. This has the same kind of sound as that head, but with more of a punch. I play hard rock and this head is perfect, really gives me that full snare sound I want.
0,I've been struggling to find an accurate headstock tuner that isn't bothered by ambient noise from other instruments... I've tried several and so far this is the best for many reasons:		1. It finds the note immediately allowing you to dial it in tightly.	2. As mentioned, ambient noise does not throw it off.. This is usually a nightmare for me when trying to tune onstage with a rock band	3. It hides discretely on the back of your headstock	4. The clip has rubber on it allowing it stay put.		There are a few reasons why the tuner gets 4 stars instead of 5:		1. The color. Come on Snark. Purple?? I know the company probably wants it to stand out a bit so everyone else sees what type of tuner the player is using, but it looks like a woman's hair clip.  I guess this doesn't surprise me considering the colors they have for their other tuners.  It would be nice if they made it in black or dark brown.		2. The face doesn't swivel at all.  You are a bit limited as to where you can put it on the headstock.  If you are not looking directly at the face, you won't be able to see the reading.  I guess it was made with guitar players in mind, but it's a bit of an awkward fit for banjo.		All said and done, it's a fantastic tuner and I'm buying another as a spare.... And I'm sure once the purple one arrives in the mail, they'll decide to make a black one! Haha
0,Excellent sound quality but I wish it had a battery to power it as an option. Would love to take this on a plane to split my headphone output on an iPad. I also purchased 1/4 to 1/8 headphone adapters. See photo.
0,Only strings that I like!
0,This product came as described by amazon with no packaging problems and no product problems. Thank you.
0,Our son loves this pedal board as it comes with a cover to use for transportation, and plenty of connection cords. He has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses. It looks very stylish and functional as well.
0,I've been using D'addario strings for 3 or 4 years now and I have to say they are the best quality and best sounding strings on the market. They have a nice bright sound that brings out natural harmonics easily. These strings also hold up to the most extreme playing, bending, yanking, etc. I also love the way they work on floating bridges like Floyd Rose and related.		I used to have a hard time tuning new strings on a floating bridge, but these strings seem like their are made to be used on floyd rose's. These strings take like 10 minutes to string up and stay in tune forever. Other strings stretch too much and its a pain in the *** to keep them in tune.		If you want strings that will stay in under the most demanding circumstances and last for 3 months plus, I would recommend these strings! Go buy them already!!!
0,I've owned many pedals, usually the Yamaha type that are plastic covered rubber.  This one has more exposed plastic, but I really like the design--the flat top, sloped back end, etc.  Cool design.  Switchable for NC or NO, which is nice, and good feeling action.  Well made and durable for stage life, although I might be somewhat hesitant to drop it from a few feet on to a concrete floor, which I wouldn't be with the lighter rubber covered ones.
0,I use these on my 2000 Warwick FNA Jazzman and I absolutely love them. They're super easy on my fingers, and they cut down on the brightness of the guitar. Don't get me wrong, Warwick basses sound amazing, but they can be a bit bright. These strings subdue some of that & really produce a fat sound. Great strings!
0,Recommended!
0,Low cost, good look in black. Just used the black boot, not the electric part.
0,I've been on the hunt for a great compressor pedal and I've found it! . I've used a boss cs3, an mxr custom comp, mxr dyna comp, but this one blows them all away! Those pedals are all good too but I feel that the sp is more musical. The blend knob is great! It is a parallel compressor and so this allows you to blend your unaffected dry signal to the compressed signal. The result is that you can dial in the perfect amount of compression. This pedal is often compared to the barber tone press and I've read many reviews on that too and supposedly the sp and the tone press are very similar. Haven't tried that pedal out my self though. One day I'll try it out but as of now I'm very happy with the sp compressor. It's on my pedal board first before overdrive and it's on all the time. Sounds really good and it makes playing feel easier. There's dip switches inside the pedal too to custom tailor the sound but I haven't bothered with that. It sounds good just the way it is. I recommend this awesome pedal. It's great!
0,I've been learning to play bass on Rocksmith using a Jaguar Squier.  I was pretty happy with that bass, but wished the pickups were a little more responsive.  Sterling has an answer for that with an active pickup system that uses a 9V battery to enhance the bass' own pickups.  Having the pickups a little further down on the teardrop has also made plucking a little bit easier (as I tend to be aggressive)...the active pickup helps me to relax my playing a bit as well - a very welcome change for me.		Build is extremely solid and the neck feels very smooth for slides.  The 3+1 tuning arrangement also gives the look of this bass a little bit of flair; it looks unusual and eye-catching.		Overall, for the price, it's a great bass and a good pickup for the aspiring bass player.
0,They really have a good grip to them. I've used many others and have compared.	I play a lot of Country Music on my guitars. You won't go wrong with these Picks.	Fast Shipping!
0,Great Strings!
0,met all expectations
0,60?! Yes.
0,Just as advertised and at a reasonable price this pickup works as I had hoped on my acoustic guitar. It stays in place for the most part but once in a while it will fall off, I guess because of the change in humidity, but otherwise works as described. I have a small cheap guitar amp but for my purposes works fine and can't comment on how it might work on a larger amp but I would think it would work just as well. I am very please with this purchase,
0,Good quality cable	have ordered another..
0,WOnderful Product fast shipping Looks Great
0,Love them.
0,I love this head! I wanted a Micro Terror but the lack of effects loop stopped me. When I saw the Micro Dark had a loop I did not hesitate . Very responsive to the volume knob. Well engineered. I use the headphone out into other amps for super cool tones. Sounds amazing.
0,been a godsend,  sounds better to me than the larger vintage counterpart with my setup.  does start to smell if you get too loud though.
0,PROS	These headphones feel, look and sound GREAT. These are probably the best headphones for the price IF you are using them to listen to music.		CONS	However, I am a composer and audio engineer and wanted to use these for mixing and composing purposes. So the fact that these headphones are colored so that anything coming through them sounds good is a minus for me. These add some low-mid body to mixes and a very little bit of pleasant reverb. This is great for listening, but when I'm looking for problems in a mix these colors can cover those problems so I don't catch them.		But don't let this "coloration" con keep you from buying if you are simply an avid music listener. As an audio engineer I had to send these back and get some open backed AKGs.
0,Looks a little better in the photo, but it's comfortable and decent quality.
0,After selling my previous three (2 Gibsons and a Peavey), this is now my fourth and only electric. This is a stunning instrument for this price and arrived from Amazon well wrapped and playable. This one was untuned and will need a minimal initial setup for perfect intonation and action, which is already excellent out of the box. This is to be expected from any new wooden instrument. Since some apparently arrive perfectly setup, and even tuned, good luck to you!		After a quick tuning I immediately fell in love. Does it lose a star for having entry level tuners and pickups? No way. This is an absolutely gorgeous instrument. I'd have to recommend this guitar to just about anyone looking for great quality at a low price. As a project, backup, or just as is Epiphone has set a standard. The picture on Amazon shows no pickguard, but the exact model I received (made in Indonesia) is ESGSCHCH1 which has the black pickguard shown on Epiphone's website. Compared to the G400's shown at local shops, I actually prefer the streamlined look of this model, with its simple two knob design.		I'm planning to take the instrument to a professional for setup and possible fret leveling to eliminate some of the buzzing I get on my A string lower on the neck. As a noob, I've been experimenting with action and intonation adjustments, but alas, I am a noob. My understanding is that a professional can easily turn this $169 Epiphone into something that plays and sounds as good as a far more expensive instrument.		Before owning this instrument I had doubts about Epiphone, always thinking of them as inferior to Gibson. Wrong I was!
0,These knobs are exactly what I needed for my guitar I am restoring.  They are made of a good, durable plastic and the fit is perfect. If you need replacement knobs try these.
0,We've used this at a few events and so far so good. Keep spare batteries on hand, we use rechargeable batteries and had to swap each mic once during a 10 hour event. The sound quality is pretty good especially for announcing. We didn't use it for any singing. We used these for running robotics competitions and didn't have any problems. We put normal mic pop filters on them and that seemed to help audio clarity. For the price these have been very good for the couple weeks we had them.
0,This set of strings rocks!
0,This is an awesome strap! It is very comfortable and easy to adjust. The material is similar to that of a seat belt on the side that actually touches your shoulder. The top of it is a really cool design that, in my opinion, matches my guitar quite nicely. I haven't had it for all that long, but it seems like it is extremely durable and will last a long time!
0,Looks cool! bought it as a gift!
0,Perfect - I like them a lot.  Great tone and NO squeaks when you slide.  Very good string,
0,SUMMARY	At $20 it is a great size and "ok" quality to round up a bunch of various stands you may carry to a band practice or gig. Other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside. No padding or impact resistance is provided, but gets a bunch of stands in one bag with a handle. Also available 8" longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different models.		PROS:	- Good size for speaker stands, mic stands, guitar stands, music stands other than the top shelf, and other "what-not" you may want to cram in there, depending on your style.	- affordable at $20	- availalbe on prime shipping		CONS:	- This model is one compartment. For speaker stands, you may want a 2 compartment model.	- Lack of any impact resistance - the bag has no padding at all. it is just canvas.	- It would be great if they made one of these just a little wider to be able to accomodate music stands.		DETAILS	In one of my 50" bags, I was able to put:	 - 4 folding mic stands	 - 1 music stand, other than the top piece with the shelf (that does not fit, even if the bag was empty.)	 - 2 folding guitar stands	 - and still had room for some more if I wanted to put more in.	 - bag was getting kind of heavy at that point.		In a second 50", I was able to put:	 - On Stage Stands OSS SS7761B Speaker Stands	 - They fit with extra room on the ends in this 50" bag.	 - There is additional room to add mic or guitar or music stands	 - I am considering exchanging this one for a 2 section 50" bag so the speaker stands are separated, but probably will just keep this one.		The bag has no padding at all - it is just canvas and a zipper and handles. When laying empty it is 50" long x about 12" wide and lays flat. Seems strong enough to round everything up and tote it around,But for $20, serves a basic purpose with affordability.
0,This is the reason I got this pedal. My Vibe would take over too much of the guitar's tone and my Trem was a bit lackluster(not enough movement). This pedal gives you the movement of a Vibe without taking over your tone. I love both Trem and Vibes but sometimes I just want SUBTLE. I have a Phase 90 but it goes into the Vibey Swirly area too much. I call my Phase 45 pedal my "Fancy Tremolo".
0,Great!
0,Before I bought this I used my Blue Snowball's mini-stand, which sat on my desk. However during my recordings I have to type and use my mouse, and the Blue Snowball is so sensitive it would pick up the vibrations through the desk. So I bought this stand with the Blue Snowball's Ringer which allows the Blue Snowball to be mounted on this stand, and now I can type away with no background noise. However, the weight of the Snowball and the Ringer is too much for the stand, and unless you have the boom parallel to one of the stand's legs it will easily tip over. Its a bit of a hassle, but unless you bump the microphone or stand then you need not worry about it falling over.
0,Frankly, I can't believe the quality manufacturers are pulling off at a reasonable price point. I've gone through quite a few audio interfaces in my day, and this is up at the top of those in my home studio -- and I've honestly never been a big fan of M-Audio in the past.		It's solidly built and flexible. All inputs sound dead quiet, and the mic pres are pretty darn good. I'm not retiring my Joe Meek outboard pre yet (a personal love affair of mine), but if I didn't have it handy I'd have no issues using these phantom powered-equipped ones. The four inputs make this a great box for doing scratch recordings home or on location with a band as well, so I'm really not complaining.		Finally, latency is next to nothing, which is a big, big deal for me (as, I suppose, it is for everyone). The Avid software that comes with it is useful for basic recording, though not, obviously, on a par with the major players in the space.		But for the price, I can't see doing better. Well built, plenty of inputs, transparent, phantom power, low latency... a great choice.
0,This amp is fabulous.  I use it for my classical guitars with a mic, my electric classicals, and my archtop jazz guitar.  All of them sound great!  The classical guitars sound like classsical guitars, not electric guitars.  The jazz guitar sounds as it should also.  The effects are awesome, and there is more than most people would ever use.  It's light and convenient to carry, I recommend getting the case, as no matter how careful you are, amps get bumped.  This one is so beautiful I don't want it all beat up.
0,Very sturdy, yet light board! Plenty of room for my pedals (starting with 5 pedals plus volume and I have plenty of room to add).  The case is nice and sturdy, and the Velcro it comes with is great quality and keeps the pedals stationary well.
0,Excellent product and seller. Highly recommended.
0,Excellent design, materials and craftsmanship. This bag is superior to most cases of this type that I have seen including the padded gig bags that came with my big name electric guitars.		I'm amazed at the low cost and at the same time expect to get years of great service from this bag.
0,No bad for some super light strings haven't played for a while so need to build up to some heavier ones.
0,This is a great "no thrills" metronome, where it only provides a solid loud beat and a light feature. It's nice to have subdivision and other note variants, but sometimes simplicity works too. I wish it had a volume knob though, the beat is pretty loud (which is good is some situations but not good in others).
0,Basic arm, the final link that holds the mic mount should have an tightness adjustment, but all else is good.
0,I'm not in the know on electric strings, but I like to take a break from the classical and play a little metal every once and a while. I needed new strings and was looking for something cheap and loose... err not stiff.	These fit the bill and have been good for distorted chord progressions, simple '80's solos and running scales.	I do get a little buzz on the G, which has never happened with my guitar before, but it is getting old and could probably use some adjusting.
0,I purchased a 3 pack of the soft rubber wedgie's as an add-on to a larger order. As such, I found them to be a reasonable value. However, I'm not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic. I think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or "uke". They are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comfort.		I love the very soft warm sound they provide. I use them mostly late at night when I can't sleep and want to play, but the rest of the family is still sleeping. Not quite as effective on the E, A, and D steel strings but certainly playable. Not so great for strumming, but fun to pick individual chords. Thanks.		SPO
0,Works great! I purchased it for my PM351 box, and it helped by being able to mount it onto a mic stand. Now, it's easier to control the volumes, and I'm satisfied. I'd recommend this item!!
0,Needed this cable to get from the mixing board to one of my amps.  It did the job well.  Quality build, fit as expected in each of the jacks.  Expect a long life from these babies.
0,Great! It was delivered on time. Good product!
0,good sounding at a good price.
0,as expected
0,I've just switch over from another unit from another well-known company. I play solo shows, a ton of them, and such units are the center of my mixing, effects, etc...so it has to be good and dependable. This is the best sounding unit I've ever heard. The harmonies are the most natural out there. The gender mods sound great when used in moderation. Easy to figure out right out of the box. Love the looper, but the Sound Check feature is a huge game changer!! My preset building has gotten faster and better. I never used doubling effects with other units because it sounded odd in the monitor when setting my patches... no more. I can sit back and use sound check to hear how it will ACTUALLY sound to my audience. The mic preamp or "gold channel" is simply magic. My Beta 87 mic never sounded so good. I am just overjoyed with the build quality, simple-yet- total control over my sound. If you are a solo guy and get sticker shock from those other guys, don't feel like you are settling for an inferior product getting this one.. It is just different..and in my opinion, better. Would work great in a band setting, but I feel it is really perfect for an acoustic solo/duo type situation where tone, clarity, and warmth are allowed to shine. I used to have the digitech VL3 and I strayed for a few years to another brand..never again...Thanks Digitech!!!
0,Great strings!
0,This fog juice is great it put out a lot of nice thick fog way better than the cheap stuff at the stores
0,AWESOME SPEAKER...amazing british style crunch tone that is very raunchy and a great sounding speaker for rock,blues and metal. Has good brightness and clarity. Works great with a tube amp and brings out the warm details of your midrange with excellent harmonic balance. The speaker arrived on time and in new conditon. Couldn't be happier...very pleased.
0,Fast shipping.  No problems.
0,Super portable and great for small projects. The keys seem slightly delayed but they are not weighted so I expected that.
0,Not much to say, these are your basic hex core, nickel plated round wound strings.  They are the equivalent of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ernie-Ball-Slinkys-Yellow/dp/B0002M6CVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ernie Ball Slinkys (Yellow)</a>&nbsp;They play nice, and feel pretty much the same in my humble (non-touring musician's) opinion.		Also, it's nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer.  As a note these come packed together in a single bag, with color coded washers, (as opposed to the EB sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or DR sets that come two to a sleeve.)		In summary, if you're searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren't reading this review, you're out experimenting.  For others, the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more.
0,I purchased the DEQ2496 to compliment other rack processors and am enjoying the rich and numerous processing options it provides across a broad spectrum of sampling rates. The RTA (Real-time Analyzer) function is unique for optimizing the unit's frequency response to compensate for my Rockit active monitors interaction with room acoustics. This is accomplished in the same manner as how most new surround sound receivers now perform this task. I have the unit connected in series with the mixing console (DAW-based) using the digital AES/EBU interface and also outputting to a Behringer SX 3040 Sonic Exciter. Another exciting feature is the 31-band equalizer function which provides remarkable granular control useful for fine tuning output response. A full compliment of digital and analogue metering options are on tap except a display for assessing the stereo or multi-track phase and soundstage live which is notably absent. Instead a static map to display the width and depth variables is provided. The AD/DA performance is surprisingly good.		Overall the signal-chain events are similar to high-end plug-ins such as Izotopes' Ozone 5 but the system lacks any on-board presets which I feel would add desirable functionality. Programming the unit for specific scenarios can take considerable time when compared to a plug-in equivalent or when compared to other types of rack processors that provide presets as a standard feature. (except for the RTA function which is very quick). The control and programming logic however is straight forward so the unit does its job pretty well. I will confess that some of the parameter functions' audible results are not readily apparent and that I am still working through some of the intricacies involved in programming the signal chain to produce desired results. The manual is verbose in nature offering an explanation of functionality but limited mixing tips and tricks content so prepare for some schooling. For the price it is proving to be a worthy tool for general mixing/mastering duties. Labor is not included.
0,Actually helped w/ bass.  I had carpal tunnel surgery, and this provided JUST enough cushion and compression that my bass did not kill my hand.	Having said that - beware using a short or standard scale guitar - glove can get in the way of strings.
0,Good microphone, but occasionally tricky to configure with Garageband on the Mac. Still, good quality overall. Definitely better than the non-Pro version.
0,A great little device that anyone working with audio should have several pairs of.  We use them primarily in a recording studio setting to pad down hot mic pres that don't have builtin output attenuation.  This is especially effective with "character pres" that you want drive hard going in to the pre for maximum color and saturation but then pad the signal down going back in to the DAW.  Product is very well made; the pad switch and XLRs seem very durable and feel like they will hold up to years of use.  Shure certainly knows how to make durable, workhorse equipment.  These have all worked flawlessly for us.
0,We had a guitarist that used a passive pick up in his acoustic guitar. This iscreased the volume and made the guitar sound great.
0,Fender as always...... Great thin pick
0,I think these are the best light gauge strings around.
0,It's a $100 guitar plus accessories. The case fits. The tuner works. The strap is a strap. The extra set of strings are nice to have. Tuned right up sounds good. What else could you want. It's a cheap guitar I am happy to own
0,Well, it works and is what it is. I can't say anything negative about the shoulder rest. That being said, I went with a more adjustable shoulder rest for my particular needs. This is a solid rest and will work well for most people.
0,Arrived as promised.  It is great.
0,I bought my NYXL set from guitar center about 45 days ago and installed on my Gibson LP studio electric guitar.  I like the way it sounds and easy to play ... Putting  the strings on the guitar was not difficult at all with the help of YouTube tutor :) I keep this set purchase from Amazon in the guitar case as spare. Quality of D'addario products...

0,I spent a lot of time on Amazon reading reviews - comparing prices. I wanted an amp that would have overdrive and I also wanted some power. There are so many choices from the small portable units (I was afraid they would sound like toys) to the big units (They would sound great but I couldn't afford them). I am thrilled with the Starcaster. This amp delivers a huge sound and the overdrive sounds great for grunge and metal while you can also play crisp clear rock or country through it. If you want a small amp to take anywhere and be able to show your rock star image - this is the one for you.
0,This is one of my favorite pedals. It's so simple, but it really adds some sweetness to my guitar sound. Versatile too. You can dial it in for just a little added gain/dirt to your clean channel. Or put it after the overdrive/fuzz for killer solo boost. Volume/bass/treble/gain knobs give plenty of options for dialing in the perfect sound . And it only cost $25! This is a first-rate pedal.
0,Put this in my strat. Definitely get's some beefier tones, but will never quite match a full size humbucker. All said, if all you have is the option for this size, this pickup is the way to go. Strongly prefer this to a Hot Rails, for example, which I had tried previously.
0,This is $27 bucks well spent! I'm a multi-instumentalist musician, wanted something for the kids, found this, it's pretty nice for the money. Build quality is quite decent, the frets will need dressing, the fretboard is cheaply ebonized but looks pretty smooth, the fretboard overall is pretty good quality, level frets, decent intonation. finish is nice-looking, it's heavy paint and clear-coat, which deadens the sound a lot, but it looks nice, and my kids loved it. Sustain is pretty minimal, you will have to pay a lot more for an instrument with really good tone and sustain, but this is good for a starter, it does not feel like a toy, you can actually play real music on this little thing! Which surprized me a lot at this price point. Tonally, it is biased towards the bass end of the scale, it does not have the bright sound of my higher-cost ukes. You can't expect wonderful tone at this price point. Good choice for a beginner who can't spend a lot, or if you're not sure if you'll stick with it. If you do stick with it, you will of course want to buy something nicer. The action is of course too high, this seems to be always the case with cheap ukes, if you have files you can lower the action  at the nut and bridge in 20 minutes, definitely  necessary for kids. The bridge insert and nut are claimed to be Nubone material from Graphtech, which if true is a big plus! The strings are actually pretty good, surprizingly so, although it will of course sound better with a nice set of Aquilas on it. I tune my ukes old-school, to D-tuning, one full step up from normal, so maybe this makes a difference with the strings. The open-geared tuners are a nice dolphin shape, they are rough-feeling, but hold tune pretty well. You should invest in a tuner, I use Guitar Machine app for iPhone, with nylon strings you will be tuning up for a full month before they settle in. You really need to understand that initially you will be tuning up every five minutes of playing or so, really, no joke. Nylon stretches like crazy and goes out of tune, so tune up constantly. Overall impression is that this is a good choice for entry-level playing, it is a real instrument, not a toy like you might expect, and will let you play real music with a little set-up to lower the action. A better choice for a beginner who doesn't mind spending a little more is the Lanikai LU-11 soprano, for about $55 it is an excellent choice, great tone and sustain, excellent build quality, feels like a quality piece, will make the Mahalo sound like a toy in comparison. And - Aquila strings will make any soprano sound better.
0,Very low noise, as compared with others I've bought.  very satisfied, ordered 3 more.
0,The saddle is shaped nicely however it is just a hair to thin for my J200 as the saddle rocks in the slot. I used it but had to shim the bone saddle side so it has a good fit (snug but not tight) in the slot. The thickness was not 3.3mm rather 3.1mm out of the packaging.
0,Useful 6 string capo.  Delivered on time and as described.
0,Good item works and seems to be of good quality I have several of these and will buy more of them.  Mine is on an Alesis QS7
0,This pedal, in price contrast, is awesome. Very useful and easy to play with. When I plug it with my Digital Delay 400 I made some sonic atmospheres and it works for what I was looking for. So, if you're looking for a pedal with some efects and don't have a lot of money, go blindly for it! The pedal bundle came in combo, and its like a normal cable... The polishing cloth and the pick card is very cheap but, at least, I took it as a gift present from the store.
0,These mics are amazing. I would recommend being a bit tech savvy to make sure the mics are performing at there best. You can kinda consider these a bit of a project but when you finish they will blow you away! They will work as is bit could be optimize for better performance. I bought 4 and will probably buy more in the future.		First you will need to know how to solder. Unscrew the mic and get rid of the old thin crappy wires and put some better ones in (I used some old mic cable I had laying around) make sure it is wired correctly, the terminal on the top portion of he mic that is red actually was the negative terminal on my mics. So wire the negative to pin 3, the positive to pin 2 and pin 1 to where it already was minus the jumper to pin 3.		Side by side comparison to an old (maybe 10 years) sm57 and I couldn't believe my ears it's not exactly the same as the sm57 (but really no two mics are the same) but it had its own unique sound comparable to the sm57 it had a bit more gain and a bit more clarity (high frequencies)	This mic is a STEAL you should by a bunch!		(UPDATE)	Bought 3 more just recently 4-17-17. I opened them to fix the connections and they were correct already, they still had the thin cheap though. Looks like pyle read our comments and fixed the problem.
0,This one sure makes it easy to adjust to various positions.
0,Heavy, black - does the job. Metal base. Standard thread.
0,These reached me in one day, free Amazon Prime shipping with a large outer protective box.  Stands come in a printed box with hang tags and "Jamstands" logo sticker on side of the rod.		The carpet pins work well to balance on medium shag, rubber pins are also included.  These are stable with Behringer Truth 2031a 8" montors at 35" height.		The rod clamp is strong enough to hold up these 20lb monitors without using the security pin, so you get infinite range of adjustment.		One of the rods has a tiny dent in the side and one of the square plates was not perfectly flat so it gets 4/5 stars.
0,Great little portable amp.  Just what I needed at a great price.
0,Is a must have if you own a Digi Tech looper.
0,Clean
0,If you play guitar or bass, you NEED to own at least one of these for each instrument.  They work exceptionally well.
0,The String Swings are great. They look good and do the trick. If you instrument is in a case and in the closet it won't get played nearly as much as if it is on the wall calling to you!
0,Okay product, can be hard to read under stage lights.
0,These work for large diameter, wireless mics.
0,It's a good value for an Orff (rhythm) instrument. 8" is a nice size.
0,I do recommend this is you are messing around at home on a stool practicing. The strap is leather but not real thick or wide enough to offer any real comfort while standing for an extended duration of time. I bought this specifically for home use and it is used for that. Overall, still a good price over a nylon one either way. Hope that helps
0,As described
0,Make's my picking instantly feel smoother.
0,I take one star off because this is a small desk tripod and when I went to hook my nice microphone to it the darn thing tipped over.  I am happy with it when it holds my smaller mic, but does not work well with my heavier mic.
0,This pedal is big but does it's job very well.  Everything functions well, the construction is solid and the pedal is very quiet.  Works well with my acoustic guitar and mandolin.  Acoustic is running a LR Baggs Anthem SL powered pickup.  Mandolin is running a LR Baggs Radius passive pickup.  The Boost gives me enough control to mix the two into one output.
0,good
0,cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use. Still highly recommended for the money,
0,Worked like a charm. The guitar looks great.
0,Very bright sounding strings. Projects well.
0,Nice sound, a bit brighter than clear treble strings. Plus the medium tension strings work well on my Cordoba classical fusion-style guitar.
0,This product is just what I needed for my stomp boxes when I play my harmonica.  Reverb, Digital Reverb, Crunchy noise and another variable box. Love the way all the units daisy chain together and all work off the same power unit.  This was a return or refused unit but had all the items in the box.  Love the way it keep everything together in one place with space for extra cords.  Highly recommend this unit!!!
0,Excellent.
0,I haven't used these yet bought them so we could have some on hand. But they are what they say they are.
0,Mine came in remarkably good condition. It had the usual rough fret edges and various other cheap guitar downsides like worthless tuners but right away I noticed it was one of the rare squiers that was otherwise flawless. Even the bead of solder on the ground wire in back looks perfect and polished. I'm the kind of player who takes the backplate off my strats too and the body cavity was smooth and nicely painted. If it wasn't for the 6 screw holes left by taking off the plate you would think it had been built that way on purpose (like the on the JM strat and a few others). You most likely will not have the same luck as I did since you roll the dice on import strats but I had to give a good review anyways. Stay thirsty my friends.
0,I am very impressed with the quality and the sound for the price!  Tuned it immediately upon unpacking and played a couple of songs and it sounds good both using the pickup and without.  I have a few other ukulele's and wanted one with a pickup without paying too much since I do not play with a pickup enough to warrant spending a fortune.  This works for me. It came with quite a few accessories which is very nice indeed. My only issue is that the lovely book that comes with it is written almost entirely in Chinese except for the diagram words showing the name of the parts. It would have been nice to have an English version since they are selling so many in the United States.
0,I think it works beautifully and sounds nice it is also at a very nice price THANK YOU VERY MUCH !
0,Good price & decent sticks
0,Works really great.
0,It works great.  I'd give it 5 stars but it isn't the kind that folds down.  I got the fold down one too and it fits into my case better.  This one not so much.
0,Not as vibrant as non-coated D'Addario Phosphor Bronze I usually use but still good.  Too soon to tell if the coating will retain tone and are worth the extra cost.  Others swear by them.  My first try.  We'll see.
0,These are practical, but my only complaint is if you forget and try to adjust the music stand by the lip, you'll easily knock the tray off.
0,I Like this product. It is very sturdy and gets the job done. The locking mechanism isn't very sturdy though and the mic will move if bumped. Not a big deal if you don't bump it lol. It looks very sleek.
0,I needed a bridge to replace one on an older inexpensive guitar. For the price I sure wouldn't take the time to make a new one from scratch.  It worked very well for the guitar I repaired. The Guitar is very playable now.and the price sure was right.
0,very good product, works well with my use.
0,Despite the hole in the plectrums, they performed quite well. I did note that the holes were uniform, and Lawdy Lawdy thank the lordy, were well adept in the performances of 'The Beverly Hillbillies-Theme', Mozart's' '40th Symphony' and  'The  Hawaii 5-0 theme'.  The hole did not  deter this Englishman. Me Mum thought the holes 'tacky' & attributable to the Irish/Chinese cousin of hers who works at the factory. He undoubtably reckons they save on plastic, That putz of a schmole, He's  named Wella Hung Dong , the former 'Real estate agent' , a Yank term that, he knows what ' alot ' is.  Cheers  !  - insert laughter here -
0,i love how little space these use in a gig bag. they work. I'm gentle on gear so I can't say how tough they are or durable, but the feel like quality.
0,This strap has a cool design but it doesn't go all the way! It stops about half way the strap. But Still its pretty cool and not too bad!
0,Excellent price most other music shops or online stores charge $1-$2 extra. A good buy
0,I used this unit to connect the desk top computer to the church audio mixer. Before I got this, there was a low hum, now there isn't.
0,I love this wonderful piece, it sounds amazing has great tone.
0,Simple, affordable, and gets the job done. I like it!
0,these sets of fret wire are excellent for making guitars, easy to set into the finger board. Shipping is pretty slow but otherwise very satisfied
0,These strings will fit soprano and concert size banjo ukuleles as well as a few tenor sizes.  Banjo ukuleles need longer strings to accommodate the length between the bridge and the end of the tailpiece where to affix the string.  Regular soprano and concert strings are not long enough.  They have all the features and sound that players are used to with Aquila products.  You either like Aquila or you don't, but if you do these are the ones that will fit your banjo ukulele.
0,Very nice unit.
0,I bought mine IN PERSON from GC (Guitxx Centxx).  It was a few years ago, and I could pick and chose (in person) which sticks I bought...		I purchased 5 or 6 packs of wood tip 5B, and 1 pack of 5A (wish I had purchased MORE)... yes around 60 or 70 PAIRS of drum sticks		These sticks are almost exactly the same as Vic Firth 5B wood tipped sticks. The difference is that these sticks are slightly rougher in texture, they do not have a shiny finish on them like Vic Firth 5B wood tipped. But other then that they are practically the same drum stick. The "shiny finish" on Vic Firth sticks wears off anyway (fairly soon), so I really don't see any difference... these sticks won't slip as easily from your hands if you perspire.		When I was at Guitar Center I grabbed a pair of Vic Firth 5B wood tipped sticks, and I grabbed a pair of Musician's Gear Hickory 5B wood tipped sticks and I cross matched them (one hand Vic Firth, the other Musicians Gear) - I then compared both, thickness, length, weight (always fluctuates a little from pair to pair regardless), shape - they both were pretty much exactly the same. The only real difference again being there isn't a shiny finish (or decal) on these sticks.		Price wise, in comparison, $1 per pair versus $7 plus per pair for Vic Firth. $1 a pair is 50 cents a stick... if you break or lose one... doesnt hurt nearly as much!		These sticks are a great bargain and very well made.		The one thing I can tell you is that they do not come "matched" in pairs, they come in bulk (a shrunk wrapped package of 20 drumsticks). You have to match pairs for yourself.		$60 for 60 pairs, versus $420 for 60 pairs... ($7 x 60). BIG difference in price!		Hope this review helps.		UPDATE:	AWESOME STICKS - BEEN USING THESE EXCLUSIVELY FOR *YEARS* NOW!		1-13-16	Purchased 2 more packs (20 pair total) from Gtr Center, they only had two packs of 10 in 5A wood tip left, snatched them up		GREAT STICKS - EXACTLY THE SAME as Vic Firth 5A wood tip except no slick lacquer finish and no logo		love them
0,My guitarist likes these.
0,Good product
0,Lots of fun. Lights dance to music and the steps of our fashion models. Takes quite a bit of volume to make it work though. Crank up the sound and have fun. It is BIG and heavy. we just set it on the floor and it is very efective.
0,My favorite picks yet, and I've tried MANY in the decades I've been playing. I use my fingers about 33% of the time. These picks sound great and they're so inexpensive. I use the 68s.
0,all good.
0,Does what it is supposed to do, and I always know which one is mine by the color.
0,Works with Strymon BigSky pedal and Strymon Library software on Windows 10, 32/64 bit.. Plug Roland Midi "In"plug to Bigsky midi out socket, and Roland "out' plug to BigSky midi in socket.		Windows 10 showed an exception in the Device Manager for the UM-One though it did not show that device name. Right click and click on update drivers > let windows find a driver online. And viola, it shows clean in Windows Device Manager as two UM-One software devices, one Midi in and one Midi out I imagine.		Quick delivery works perfectly, 5 stars.
0,All the equipment needed to get the job done !!
0,look good sound good, We like it
0,I play the bass and have three amp modelers I play through.  Each of the modelers boosts my signal and I wanted a clean boost pedal to allow me to play my bass without a modeler and still maintain my volume.  I needed more than 10db boost and this pedal looked like the solution.  I'm running the pedal at about 1-2 o'clock and it is clean and quiet (very low noise).  Great pedal!
0,Very, Very cool!
0,Does a great job for my uke, bass, and guitar.
0,great quality!
0,I bought this pedal used for about $35. I use it as an overdrive for my bass. The actual drive part sounds AWESOME. Only problem with this pedal is the noise it creates but it's still worth it.
0,Worked out beautifully on my "parts-caster".
0,Okay i was a little aprehensive paying for a guitar cloth when good chances it's like any other cloth (microfiber) out there.		Well it's actually finer than the standard microfiber cloth you buy at costco.  So its gentle on my guitar's finish.  I will be more diligent to wipe my Martin D35		using this great polish		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dunlop-Formula-65-Guitar-Polish-Cleaner/dp/B000EELB8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish & Cleaner</a>
0,Use it with a pretty heavy mic, so it tends to droop if we don't screw it really tight.
0,I purchased three different clip-on tuners at the same time for three different setups.  This one is by far the best.  It is accurate, and it responds very quickly.  I can tune up many times faster with this than with tuners by different companies.
0,I selected this to replace the cheap plastic Saddle that came on my Fender acoustic. This was a tremendous upgrade and made a difference in the tone and 'brightness' of the sound. This was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions.
0,Well made nice quality wood setup ready to play! I like the no slip guitar tuners with Aquila strings. Lovely tone and worth the price!
0,Perfect fit. Quality.
0,It's hard to give less than 5 stars because this light is just an amazing value. It packs a serious punch in terms of output and feels quite sturdy. It has a very thin profile and the housing is a thick rugged plastic. Mounting hardware feels smooth and easy to adjust. The display on the back is larger than other lights of this style which is nice when configuring DMX channels. I control mine via a software DMX system, so I can't speak for the built-in modes. It has worked flawlessly in a DMX environment.		I was curious how this light would perform vs. the more expensive 4-in-1 style, and to my surprise the color-mixing is very smooth and has very litle 'rainbow' effect when used as a wash/uplight. I recently played a gig at a winery and used this light for back-lighting the stage. This light is on the rear-left in the attached pictures, with the GBGS 8Wx9 on the right.		Potential cons: Hard-wired power cord, somewhat loud fan ( not noticeable in a live music context )
0,This Capo Works Perfect
0,Best there is for Taylor GS Mini. The guitar comes new with a set of these.	Long lasting, beautiful tone.
0,Great idea just didn't fit on our set. Read the description carefully.
0,Plays loud on my D-28. This is what I was looking for. I would highly recommend buying these strings if you play Bluegrass
0,It's higher frequency heavy, but you can't beat it for the price! I use it to double up my vocals with my Samson condenser mic.		Perfect for beginners.
0,I didn't have my research done correctly and ordered these because i wanted "vintage" for my "relic'd" build. Clearly my mistake that these do not fit the cheap necks sold here on Amazon. But no worries, Amazon sells adapters to make the "large" holes in the neck fit the "smaller" vintage tuning key posts.	1 star off for not looking like the higest quality. I'm happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price.
0,It holds the sheets nicely, doubles as a back scratcher and allows me to grab toast from the table without having to lean forward.
0,AAAAAAAA++++++++++thanks
0,I got this amp, hoping it would recreate the tube sound of the bigger vox tube amps, namely my gigging amp, the AC15.  I was very impressed.  I much prefer to use this amp as a practice amp: it's lightweight, loud enough, great clean sounds, takes my pedal board great, and it's solid state: no tubes to replace.		The onboard overdrive isn't nearly as good as Vox's tube overdrives on the big amps, but I just use the clean settings and use my effects, which it does perfectly.		If you are looking for a great amp to practice with that won't break the bank, this is it.		I've had 4 Vox amps, in order of favorite:	1- AC15	2- Pathfinder	3- AC4	4- AD50
0,Good
0,Alot of Zoom H1 users put this over their mics.  The fit is nearly perfect.  For that application this is THE windscreen to get.  Works great.
0,nice wide lip, sturdy, appears to be well made and durable, nice finish on it, hopefully will last a long time
0,I just love this super-simple modular kit. I'm a musician and analog synth enthusiast, so this is more than just a great toy to me. I've been making some awesome little sounds come out of this kit. It has everything you need to get started with some cool sounds. It's easy to use, takes all the guess work out of connections by using magnets and fits-only-one-way connectors. It comes with all the synth essentials: 2 oscillators, filter, envelope, delay, keyboard, sequencer, mixer, noise, speaker with headphone jack (which silences the speaker output that you can also just detach).  The included manual provides a good primer for theory and history of analog synths, as well as a bunch of project ideas and easy-to-follow illustrations of suggested configurations. You'll definitely want to have some free table/desk space to layout your setup, everything stays connected on flat even surfaces, but quickly pulls apart on uneven surfaces. I recommend picking up a precision screwdriver kit from the bargain bin at the hardware store for manipulating the various knobs that are close to the board -- although the tall pot knobs are easy to handle, some of the knobs that sit closer to the board are tight and hard to turn without an extension of some kind. I think beginners/kids would like this kit, but it also holds up to regular analog synth users.
0,I waited to write review until I recorded a song with the guitar. Recorded great (I used HDE Guitar Pickup Acoustic / Electric Transducer , acoustic guitar pickup, which I would recommend if you want to record with this instrument) About the guitar, first don't fret about the lame pickgaurd, its a cardboard sticker and can be peeled off.	Now the guitar, for the price, its just amazing, a bit bulky and neck is wider than Im used to but plays well, sounds great. Action wise, mid neck the strings bend well, other places are typical action for a lower priced acoustic. I am very pleased I bought this, feel free to contact me with any questions not covered in the reviews.	There is one low point, the tuning keys although very solid are kinda difficult to turn, Im sure they can be adjusted to turn more easily, haven't gotten around to that. So, not electric/acoustic but if you look up and read reviews for the pickup I mentioned, problem solved.
0,Worked quite well with my Android tablet using Djay 2, and Edjing Pro.
0,Great action! Been using it now for about 6 months with no problems. Love the string adjustment to the fret board, very fast.
0,The cord is super long. For the price this thing sounds great.
0,Wish there was more than one in this package.
0,Great piece. I used these on an ion drum kit I modded and they feel great and make little to no sound at all. no more horrible noise from the OEM kit. Now to replace the cymbals.
0,Like I said,Good,Warm Tube-like Distortion for $15 ? True ! I put the Fab OverDrive in front of this pedal and then into my amp, put a little delay on from the amp and Just about everything from a Clapton-esque "Woman" tone with Lots of sustain to a Jimmy Page-like distortion for chords can be acheived with your Guitar Volume and PickUp selector, Neck PUP and Guitar Vol 10 for "woman tone" ,Bridge PUP and lower Guitar volume to taste for anything from "tube" breakup to Randy Rhoads type rythym sounds.		All this,once tweaked right,using All the tools you have on your guitar,amp And the Fabs Without having to change anything but your guitar settings after the fact for lead to rythym ?...		Is just as it Should be; warm and Tube-Like response some more pricey pedals will Not give you,so 5 Stars to Danelectro for these Fabs and other pedals they have out there that truly are equally as impressive. I also Own the Fish n Chips EQ,Pastrami OverDrive and the Daddy-O Overdive, the latter being made out of metal and slightly higher priced but worth it and the EQ is one of the best according to just about Everyone who uses it Including me !		Hope this helps :-)
0,they work great for guitars,and I also use them to hang complete skateboards from,they mount easy,all the hardware is included,great price point!!!
0,I use these for cleaning the stylus on my turntable.  The same thing is sold for $20 to $40 labeled as a stylus cleaner.  Got these after reading a mention in Stereophile magazine and am very happy I did.
0,just  ok
0,It holds 6 picks very nicely and very securely and it seems very well built. I couldn't be more pleased...
0,Admission, I bought this piano at Guitar Center on sale for $229 over Memorial Day weekend not from Amazon.  Now that my confession is out of the way let me say this is a great deal you get even at $299 for this instrument.  If you need graded hammer action then by all means pay more and get a better instrument, there are many of them out there and they are phenomenal.  I was buying a lightweight piano for my beginning to intermediate level daughter.  I took piano lessons for 12 years growing up, passed my proficiency tests at conservatory, and my mother is still running a piano studio at 80 years old, so I know what a piano should feel like and sound like.  You are not going to get a real piano feel from a $300.00 instrument with plastic keys, but this ain't bad.  The biggest difference I notice is on the return, in other words I can play faster than the keyboard can recover, but for a student, this is inexpensive, lightweight, and never goes out of tune.  It has enough usable sounds that we have used it with my band as an emergency backup and had no complaints whatsoever.  It certainly doesn't feel like my mothers Steinway or my Young Chang but my daughter will practice this one because she can use headphones or practice in her room.  She loves it and I never have to ask her to practice, she has even started playing along with her favorite songs off of the radio/Pandora/whatever kids listen to these days.  I like the fact that this instrument has helped her involve her imagination, when you can be creative then practicing and making music is much more fun and this instrument has allowed her to begin that creative process.
0,At first I thought that this little amp was going to fall into the same category as some of the other little novelty toy amps out there but I found this to be much better quality and an actually useable tiny amp. I have a new baby which makes it difficult to plug in and play. I decided to pick up the Fly 3 after all the great reviews. Since it runs off of AA batteries, I decided to purchase the separate power supply adapter. So far I'm very impressed. It's loaded with great features. The built in delay and gain sound pretty decent. The delay is adjustable so you can dial in the sound your looking for. I've also used the amp with pedals and it sounds great. Although you won't be gigging with this tiny amp; it's just loud enough to fill a room. If you want an extra 3 watts of sound you can buy the add on speaker. My favorite feature is the MP3 line in. I picked up an MP3 cable for a couple dollars and am able to plug my phone directly into the amp allowing me to play along with backing tracks I find on YouTube. When the baby is sleeping I just use my headphones and everyone is happy. My only complaint is the power adapter and MP3 cable don't  come with the amp. The power adapter is available on Amazon for an additional $19.99 and any cheap MP3 cable will work. I found two for $2.99. Great tiny amp!
0,I play drums in a band, purely as a "hobby". We play a couple of weekends a month, all within driving distance. I had been using a hardware bag that I had to carry. I always dreaded having to load it in and out, not to mention picking it up off the floor. Then this rolling, upright bag came into my life (cue the angel chorus). Not only can I load it and unload it without ever bending over, but when it's loaded, I simply zip it up and roll it out to the van. I do have to lift it into the van, but if someone's there to grab the other end, it's easy. Even if there isn't someone to help, I can lift it for that brief moment easily enough. There are two sturdy handles on the front. This is a well-made bag considering the price. I wish I had bought one years ago! My back thanks me every time we play a show! I guess I should mention that I'm into my sixth decade, but this bag would be great for a drummer of any age! I also should mention that if you're in a band that plays all the time and is on the road a lot, this bag may not be for you. If that's the case, you should invest in higher-end, hard cases.
0,great guitar case...
0,This is yet another stunning piece of MXR equipment suitable for live performance. Ten designated bands of EQ adjustment with easy to use LED-lit sliders. Volume and gain faders, foot operated on-off push button control, all in MXR's typically rugged housing. Clean, effective EQing. Great for bringing out just the right frequencies on guitar, bass, keys, etc. Requires 18v negative center power. At $100 a perfectly functional to-the-point piece.
0,This MPK49 was listed on Amazon at almost $40 below all of the competition.  If that wasn't enough, the price was high enough to qualify me for free 5-7 day shipping.. my package arrived on the second day after ordering.  These two feats were so amazing that I had to pinch myself to ensure I wasn't dreaming.  The controller is in perfect condition (no shipping damages) and works flawlessly.		Everything on this controller feels fantastic.  Everything is weighted perfectly, the knobs/faders/keys all show a good amount of resistance (you can feel the high durability).  The pads, as everyone has stated, are a bit too insensitive; you really have to hammer down on them to get a good sound.. but I've found quite a few kits that fix this and may even attempt to just put some tape under them to close the gap.  This is my first MIDI Controller, so I have a lot to learn.  It took me under 10 minutes to install everything and configure this keyboard to work with Fruity Loops (of which there is no preset for); I'm already making music.		The only *minor* complaints I have are that it didn't come with a power adapter (it runs on USB power, though, so it's still functional) and that it doesn't have an on/off switch.		I couldn't be happier with this product (I did a lot of research and roaming around different stores in my city trying out all of the controllers) or Amazon's quality of service.		I'm simply blown away.		When I get famous from the use of this thing, I'll surely come back and show Amazon my gratitude.
0,By far the best guitar strings you'll ever use and hear! I've been using these since they came out and have never turned back. I even use their bass strings on my bass guitars!
0,so far so good
0,Perfect gift!
0,I like this pedal.  When I'm not using the reverb pedal, I'm using this one.  Great buy!
0,My favorite picks.  Last forever, have the control of nylon Jazz III with a better grip and better tone.  I feel the tone is a little bassier than nylon Jazz III, but the grip allows you to loosen up which is the main point.
0,The Promark Mike Portnoy 420x signature drumsticks are a good, decently diverse use set of sticks.  I've been able to switch between traditional and matched grip easily with these sticks and feel like I'm getting a bright and balanced sound regardless of what I'm playing when using them.  The activegrip is great for longer sessions because it does get tacky when your hands start to warm up and sweat.  These are a fairly light stick, so for heavy hitters these might not be the best way to go, though they feel sturdy enough to tackle the harder stuff just fine.  They are also the slightest bit longer at the tip than some sticks which might be a consideration depending on play and music style.  I really like these other than the fact the activegrip goes all they way from stick base to tip so it does want to come off on your equipment.  Still, if you want a fairly responsive stick that works for various styles, these are worth considering.
0,It does what it's supposed to do.
0,These are nickel round wound strings which are on the bright side of the spectrum. Designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job. You do get a bit of finger noise moving along the string which is normal for this type of wind. Being 10's they are in the middle between the lighter strings which are easier to bend and the heavier strings which are where the tone is. I love the color coding on these which makes it easier to get the right string in the right hole unless of course you are color blind and there is no help for that. They are made in the USA which is bonus points and reason enough to buy them right there, put America to work. Get to picking.
0,Pretty nice basic wireless mic system for the price.  The build quality of both the mic and unit are nice.  My only issue with this is the connection is not solid over a distance.  I am a performer and I walk around stage and into the audience.  It doesn't seem to cover its stated 200 foot range.
0,This is an awesome seat and it's built well for the price.  But do not buy it if your looking for leather, those are aboutt 400$ more and up to the sky  you dodo bird.  If you need a real good quality bench at an awesome price: then this is it!	We bought it for a child but it  appears well made  heavy duty enough for an average adult to use without any trouble.
0,Working great so far.
0,I give five star to this item
0,Good little device
0,It's my first experience with a midi controller like this, but I've played real pianos and entry-level keyboards (no sensitivity) before. This instrument works perfect, It's really nice to play and create music with it. Definitely it was a great choice.
0,protects very well my standard size bass guitar, well padded, won't scratch the instrument
0,Obviously, quality sound transmission is what counts with a guitar cable, but this cable really is a good looker.  Very nice.
0,These are much easier to play then medium strings. They stay in tune and are easy on the fingers. The sound is a bit different. A bit brighter. Not as deep and rich but good enough.
0,I am a professional guitarist and I love this guitar case. I know multiple musicians who use it. It is sturdy, has tons of pocket space, made of quality parts, and has backpack straps. It also comes with a rain poncho that fits around the case. I wouldn't recommend flying with it, but it works for every other travel situation I can think of. My only issue is it's a little bulky and heavy. When you're tight with space in the back of a car, it can be a hassle to fit it in. Overall, it's a great case.
0,The crowning touch for my tele for that vintage sound!
0,These are the only strings used by The Bicycling Guitarist on his Silver Anniversary Fender Stratocaster guitar.
0,Item is just as stated
0,My studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs.  I purchased several of these cables at varying lengths and found them quite acceptable for this application.  I'm not sure I'd put them in my remote recording kit--they're not really heavy duty.  But for speakers or other static applications, they're just fine.
0,I was on the fence about this product, but it has turned my self-healing I.T. videos into something very professional. I've been more then happy with my decision to go with it!
0,light strings will break more easily, obviously.
0,I play a variety of styles, and these strings are very versatile.  Great tone (much brighter, naturally, than flatwounds), and they work well for gospel, blues, funk, and soul.  This is my first set, so we'll see how they last.
0,People have asked me why they should use D'Addario after most people have been using Ernie Ball for the longest time. I say to them, They last longer. I muscle the living hell out of my strings, and I can get probably a week and a half out of these strings. The 3rd string is very mellow sounding, but for my tastes that's the tone I'm looking for. The packaging that these strings come in is quite nice as well. The 11-49 gauge is quite chunky, but I knew what I was getting into, because I played Power Slinkys which were 11-48. In my opinion, this kind of thing is subjective, so you must try almost every combination at least once. Various gauges, various brands, various string models, various string materials, it's all subjective, so you must take your time and decide what's right for you. I've found it with D'Addario
0,Great product, great price shipped on times, excellent seller.
0,Great leather bass strap. It's very comfortable and I love the color. I would recommend buying this to all musicians who plays standing for a long period of time!
0,Man, this case is great for the price.	It is almost as good as a Gator case	I got for another guitar but for less $$$.	It fits an old Hohner and would probably	fit the classical that live in the Gator case.	Good enough for a modest guitar for sure.	The picks aren't great, but they are free!
0,Nice and stiff, the way I like them. Holds tune better than the old ones.
0,This works well, my husband is a professional guitar player and he's the one that purchased this. He says it works great and he use it consistently when he needs to
0,Its hard to find DR flats for 5 strigns out there, price and quality is great... my bass sound almos like a double bass...
0,The only ones I buy for my acoustic.
0,- The recording quality is excellent, clear and precise stereo image.	- Just watch the recoding level, I had it set low by default, so my recoding did not maximize the dynamic range. Adjusted it and it is now perfect.	- I used for my classical recoding at home. Did the job perfectly . The LED turns off a few second after the recoding starts which is nice because I don't want blinking thing to distract.
0,Gift for my son. Professional player. Loves the strings. Perfect clear tone.
0,I have been using Shadows products since the 80's. This is an amazing product. Very tough and dose not have the noise I am used to with other types of kill switches.
0,Does it's job. Good price. Good stand.
0,This is a purchase my husband made.  He's a professional musician and is very particular when he has to restring a guitar.  These are great quality and he's given them an A+.
0,WORKS GREAT!! I use it with AKG Perception 420 Professional Microphone and with a USB XLR cable.. it has been working great for MONTHS!!!!!!!!!  It works with my MAC OSX and Windows WHEN USING XLR TO USB
0,Great product!!! I love the incorporated cutter. this is extremely handy. As long as your not too rough with it this will last a good long time. I will definitely be purchasing another one when the time comes.
0,bought originally to illuminate song book at gigs...went to a 10 inch pad for gigs and home studio, so not being used anymore.
0,I love this stand!  My Fender Ukelele fits nicely on it.  It's also	portable and folds up nicely if you want to stuff it in your case when on the go.	Buy it!  You won't be disappointed.  Because it's not heavy, you would want it to be on a hard	surface instead of the carpet.
0,I bought this to connect my Midi Pro adapter (for use with xbox 360) to my Roland TD-20.		I don't know how to rate it, other than it costs $7 and it works.  I'd pay that again if i ever needed a replacement.  It doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and i feel it will last forever, so long as i'm not constantly walking on it while it's on a hardwood floor
0,It's a valve.		Not much more to say about it.
0,This is a great little compressor.  I also have an MXR dyna comp but this has a lot more headroom and doesn't "squash" the sound.  It compresses but it is a clear sounding compression.
0,Very good quality, and sufficient padding to protect my MIDI controller keyboard without adding very much carrying weight.  The attached exterior compartment is large enough to hold all my connector cables plus some other gear, and keeps them separated from the keyboard.  I would highly recommend this keyboard bag to other musicians.
0,I'm not too picky about picks and I'd say these are about as good as any other picks I've used. I bought these from Amazon Warehouse deals and I think the reason they ended up there is a problem with labeling in the Amazon warehouse. When they shipped my .73 MM picks, I received .81 MM picks instead. I didn't bother sending them back but be warned if you are buying from Amazon warehouse deals, they may be a return from another customer who received the wrong item.
0,If you find yourself in need of a desk mount for your microphone, this one works well. It is heavy enough to keep the microphone from tipping over, and the black anodized stem gives a subtle appearance on the desk. Having the microphone always plugged in, accessible on the desk and ready to go means I save much setup time for my voice-over work.
0,I bought this bracket for my Epiphone Dot guitar, and I chose it because the chrome looks better than other materials. My only concern with it is that it doesn't lift the pickguard as far from the body as other brackets. It's not hat big of a deal, it's just not the same as other Epi Dots and Gibson 335s.
0,As always  Kyser capo's are great.  It arrived quickly from the supplier and I put it to use immediately.  I keep one in each instrument case and where I practice just in case.  Most of the time I transpose, but sometimes the difference in using a capo makes the music more unique or accurate, if doing a cover.
0,If you are a Beatle fan this is such a cute item. Was more than I expected for the price. Nice for collectable or to use.
0,I've never bought a device like this before, so I had some worries that it wouldn't work.  But sure enough, there was plug that fit the night-light that I was connecting.  And I was able to select a power setting that didn't blow up the night-light or create any sparks or fires.		If there is one downside, it is that whenever I retire this night-light and want to use the power supply for something else, I will probably have lost the other plug ends.  An option to attach the extra plugs to the adapter and keep them handy would be helpful.
0,Great power strip.
0,Tight fit for my guitar, just what I wanted. Measure your guitar first, anything over 41 won't fit.
0,I put this in my Fender MIM Stratocaster. I want to change that "poor" string guides that came in MIM by the American Series string guide. So nice...
0,Great strings
0,The Maui Xaphoon is one of the greatest things to come out of Hawaii.  Originally made by Brian Wittman, strictly out of bamboo, these high quality ABS plastic ones, licensed by him, are the only official xaphoons, and much better instruments than competing "pocket saxophones".  They are amazing instruments.  They are said to have a two octave range, but I can play mine a full two and a half from a Bb below middle C to a high F (on a good day).
0,Looked great on stage. To be honest I thought they were gonna break, especially when I invited someone from the crowd to play the drums and he really banged the sh... out these! But...they are still working with no issue. They look pretty awesome on stage especially in low light		Only bad thing is that they don't really have an on-off switch. If you want to turn them off you have to unscrew the screw that holds the batteries (with a screwdriver). Not sure how long the batteries last. We have used them in 3 shows and we have been carrying them around for a while - they do turn on when you shake them but they get the brightest when they are actually hit, so they get the job done very well. Pretty sturdy.		We have the red and the blue - attached some photos
0,Everyone has their own preference with guitar strings. But there's a level of quality with these round wounds that feel strong and smooth beneath your fingers. The price is decent and beats that of my local music store. I use them on a Fender Strat and an Epihphone Les Paul Studio. A very comfortable sting to play.
0,very nice , tight well make no fret noise.	i tecomenf
0,Good quality and affordable.
0,Arrived well packaged, but had a small nick on the headstock that chipped off, regardless.		Despite the small cosmetic damage, the uke looks great and sounds great. Would recommend most certainly.
0,Easy to mount and grip like a Bulldog!!
0,Great price good product.
0,Fantastic price and works very well.  I have four basses and three guitars.  This one is replacing a similar stand on one of the basses.		Solid construction, nice wide pad at the top, I do like it.		My only complaint is that the horizontal locking bar in the back doesn't really lock very well.  So when a strap wraps around one of the hooks on the bottom, it spins, flips over, and folds flat.  But really, it's my own fault for not being more careful when setting the bass down on the stand.
0,Great quality heavy duty cords w/sealed ends. Will not tangle and can not kink. I own several of these cords and love them plus they are so classy looking.
0,Wow, I was kind of shocked at how much I like this. It is a great little practice amp. Sounds pretty nice. Not a lot of features, but come on, for the price you will be surprised.		I really like it using my head set with it. It sounds way more dynamic and talk about surprised, when I plugged in my guitar and my headphones, I was really happy.		I like that I can take it outside (in my backyard) and play without hassling with my larger amp for a quick little practice session.
0,Good price made well fits all may not be the correct way to sell this product, like a hat big head big hat long face fits different	Different fit for different faces
0,After years of playing cheap acoustic guitars with inexpensive strings, I took a leap of faith and invested nearly 3 grand in a Taylor 618e, the newly redesigned maple 600 series. Aside from price, that Taylor's tone with the new bracing is a total game changer. Well, Taylor ships with these exact Elixirs installed, and because I got the huge Grand Orchestra, the gauge required is .13-.056, thickest gauge I've ever used. The tone of these strings on that guitar is simply infectious, but the thing that's amazing me is that after almost two months of playing this guitar every single day, the strings still sound clean! Whatever that Nanoweb coating is, it works. I do hear the bass strings starting to sound a little odd, especially when using a capo (I'm currently torturing myself learning a couple Tommy Emmanuel songs which require a capo), so I can tell that it's getting near the time to change. For these to still sound this good after almost two months (often sweating a little, we live in Pheonix, lol) is pretty impressive. I purchased two more sets when I got the Taylor in April because I liked the tone, and now I have the added surprise bonus of probably double the expected life. So while they may cost twice as much, they last twice as long, and I could probably stretch it further but I'm yearnong for that new string sound. I have heard that John Pearse strings are best in class sound wise and I will try them one day, but let's face it, we're all busy, so if i can change my strings only 5-6 times a year, the cost is a no-brainer. Maybe Elixirs are not the best sounding string (still better than anything I've ever used) but they are quite good and I'm not scheduled for any recording sessions right now (or ever, lol) so I'll take the long-lasting string any day.
0,great buy
0,I love new gadgets and this one is one I will be using for a long time.  It's not a replacement for your pick for every tune you play.  But there a number of songs I play which work great for the triller instead of a pic.  Will also be making garage band recordings with a combo of pick and triller.		It took me about a week of playing around with it to understand how to make some of the best sounds with it.  Highly recommend watching the You Tube videos while starting.		The fun alone is well worth the cost.
0,looks nice, worth it
0,superrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!! DAW!!!!!!
0,Keeps my baby clean!!!
0,I own many guitar cables: monster and planet waves.  This one is the easiest to wrap at the end of a playing session.
0,Needed a boost with my headphones while playing Rocksmith.  Item works as advertised, very easy to hook up.  I am using with xbox 360 and auvio wireless headphones (33-283, out of production, but still work great)
0,Awesome product.
0,Feel and weight for this Mic, was better than I expected.
0,I don't know how well they will hold up. They work well for now.
0,A+
0,Really a good bow.  Beats the crappy one that came with the cheap violin I ordered here.
0,Let's begin by saying that I own two harmonizers of TC Helicon's biggest competitor (version 4 of said harmonizer, and version 5). I think both companies offer products that are mutually beneficial in a studio or live situation, if you invest in both. I'll explain below.		For this review, I will say that I mainly use the unit in a studio situation, writing songs/vocals and experimenting with harmonies... and often, I'll record the harmonies, because to my ears, they sound wonderful, and realistic, even dry as a bone (no reverb, etc). I haven't used the unit live, but I'm sure it will be awesome. The only thing is, you have to go into your Setup menu and make sure the output gain is set correctly, and make sure the mic gain is right.. blah blah blah.		That said, let's give some simple pros and cons, and then we'll go into detail.		-------------------------		PROs:	- Ridiculously configurable. This cannot be understated. The Voicelive 2 is RIDICULOUSLY configurable.	- relatively easy to get going right away (start with preset #2 - Close Up 3rd)	- the menu and knobs that navigate it are pretty quick and easy to use... just remember the big knob controls the "up/down" in the menu, and the four knobs below the screen control each column and the parameters in that selected row, as needed.	- There are good "video" manuals by the company (on their own site, plus a popular video site). These are great "getting going right away" videos.	- The harmonies sound great, and very realistic. More on this below.	- the "Tone" button... it is tweakable (unlike on TC's other products), which is awesome... and it really does make your vocal sound a million times better than without.	- all of the pedals can be set to function more than what they say on the chassis, such as.. if you hold the Delay pedal, you can go into Tap Tempo mode. If you hold the FX button, you can bypass or go into guitar tuner mode... hold the Reverb switch to automatically set mic gain, and the Shortcut pedal can become basically anything you want (set key, start looping, harmony hold, you name it). It's insane (and confusing) but it's so great to have all the customization there, if you need it.	- SPDIF in/out. This is so helpful if you want to add vocal harmonies after the recording sesh. Say you're working with a female singer who is awesome but has never tried harmonizing with herself, even on a strong hook. She leaves for the night, and you're still listening to the demo, and hear some harmony on the hook. You can then route your recording software quickly, and record a harmony-only track if you want... and repeat the process for any interval you wish to add (3rd, 5th, 6th above, octave below, etc). Then, the next time she comes over for a sesh, you can show her the "studio magic" you worked while she was away... "whoa! I love those harmonies, how did you do that?" I love SPDIF and use this function a LOT with the Voicelive 2.	- being able to set the Harmony and Double pedals to "momentary" or "toggle." This is a huge thing, that I think ALL harmonizer pedals should have, no matter how low-budget/entry-level they might be. Momentary is how I switch my harmonies on about 99% of the time. Some songs just have one word that needs harmonies, such as Rogue Wave's "Eyes"... and hitting a pedal DOUBLE the amount I need to is insanely annoying and frustrating (not to mention confusing). Yay for momentary Harmony switching.	- the Harmony menu inside "Edit" is.... powerful, to say the least. It's intimidating. But man, you tweak stuff just a little bit and you'll find yourself smiling, thinking "I'm really glad I bought this."	- You can set the major and minor scales to three types (in order, when you're tweaking: Major 1 (Ionian/Major), Major 2 (Hybrid scale, which avoids harmonizing the major 7th scale degree if you sing a 5th or 6th-- very useful scale), Major 3 (Mixoldyian)... and Minor 1 (Aeolian/Natural Minor), Minor 2 (Dorian), and Major 3 (Harmonic Minor). So useful, depending on your music style.	- being able to set the output level at various settings (depending on if you're XLR out, SPDIF out, headphone out, etc). Super super useful.	- being able to set Custom scales for any preset. This is INSANELY awesome if you like bands like Low, Ida, or Alice In Chains, who don't always follow strict "common" harmony paths. For instance, I created a preset for Low's song "Violence", which... when I sing the word "vio-lence" in the chorus (Alan Sparhawk's melody), I get a virtual Mimi (drummer/harmony singer extraordinaire) singing exactly the notes I need to hear, even though the notes on the original recording do not follow a strict scalar path. This is basic math, but since I love Low and Ida so much, I created several presets which harmonize special intervals/notes as I sing certain notes. Truly awesome. That's one of the main reasons I love the Voicelive 2.	- the best tech support EVER, between Tom and Craig @ TC Helicon. These guys are fun to watch, know their product and company inside and out, and they are both great singers and performers. I have never seen better, interactive tech support than TC Helicon. Just search that popular video site, and you'll find TONS of tutorials and demos. You'll be sold, without a doubt.		CONS:	- It can be a bit confusing to set up, and configure, depending on how deep you go.	- All harmonizers get "confused" if your pitch is slightly off. This one is no exception. Nail your pitch.	- A lot of the presets are totally unusable, and too techno/pop/top 40 for my tastes. I don't need a lot of the fancy effects like uMod, etc. If you are making music like Lady Gaga and out-there top 40 or weird indie stuff like Grimes (whom I love, but don't want to make music like), these effects are for you. For me, I just want the harmony features.	- the Step pedal confuses the crap out of me. The last time I was messing with it, just trying to add a 2nd step to a preset (to switch between 3rd up harmony and 3rd+5th up harmony)... and it completely killed my preset. And it's confusing deleting steps/adding steps.... I still do not fully understand how to use the Step pedal, and I've researched a lot. :)	- the more you might tweak harmonies or the Setup, the more "phaser" or "flange" effect you might introduce when you are singing. There's a setting in the Setup menu called Lead Delay. Leave it to "None" because the other two settings make the harmonies all swishy/flangy/phasey... haha. I found this out the hard way, after tracking some vocals.	- when you set your preset to a specific scale, instead of "Auto" (where it follows your chords intelligently)... it seems like the Voicelive 2 ALWAYS defaults to Maj2 (a Hybrid scale by TC Helicon, which prevents the "gross" sound of hearing a Major 7th scale tone when you're singing a 5th or 6th, if you're using a 3rd above harmony). I don't always want the Major 2 scale when I'm setting my scale, even though it's very useful. Logically, often when you're singing a 5th scale tone, you don't usually hear vocal harmony above it... just below. So, while it annoys me that the scale always defaults to Maj2, I see its usefulness.	- It's easy to go overboard with harmonizing EVERY single thing you sing into it, because it sounds so good... DON'T. Unless you're Fleet Foxes or The Beach Boys, you don't need to harmonize every single syllable of your song. But believe me, it's VERY easy to do, when you own this thing.		THOUGHTS ON HARMONIZERS:	For the people who always complain that harmonies sound artificial in harmonizers: They ARE artificial! I mean there's no way around it. The amount of processing/thinking a computer has to do to perfectly harmonize with you in REAL TIME, well... that's a lot of processing. So there's bound to be some unrealistic sounds or artificts. Here's why this doesn't matter: when you hear harmonies by a harmonizer, along with a lead vocal, they sound absolutely fine. When you hear them on their own, soloed, yeah, they don't sound that realistic. But the point of vocal harmony is to have it along with your lead vocal, not soloed. If it sounds fine blended with the lead, then there is no issue. Just mix your harmonies low enough so they don't take the spotlight from the lead vocal. Almost all vocal harmonies on recordings and live are 50 to 75% less volume than the lead vocal. So, it's a non-issue. I just wanted to clear this up for the people who are vehemently anti-harmonizers or people who might be skeptic about buying one of these... for the record, I use one because I don't know anyone who's into the music/style I'm into, and I always want harmonies when I'm just jamming on songs, or writing my own. It makes the writing process a LOT more enjoyable. I'd kill to work with a girl who can perfectly harmonize on anything I'm writing or singing (especially if we liked exactly the same genres/styles/sounds), but in my area, they are as rare as a Buffalo nickel. So yeah, I consider harmonizers as a songwriting or studio tool, not "lame toys" or "shortcuts."		VOICELIVE 2 TIPS:		1. Just starting? Choose preset #2, "Close Up 3rd" and sing your heart out. Most vocal harmony in most popular music is no more than a 3rd above. I'm surprised this isn't preset #1.		2. Use a dynamic mic, not a condenser, especially if you're playing keys or guitar live (or live in-studio), while singing. You need a really good mic that cancels out sound you don't want, while you're live harmonizing. This isn't as noticeable live on stage, but it definitely is with headphones or in a live in-studio situation.		3. A headset mic is a wonderful investment. For me, I bought a wired dynamic one with an XLR end, which didn't cost an arm and a leg. The reason I bought this is, when I'm working out song ideas with vocal harmony, I don't want to be "tied to" singing into a dynamic mic on a stand. I like to be able to tweak the pedal/menus while I'm singing, and often, the pedal's on the floor. With the headset mic, I can tweak, sing, or sing along with instrumentals via the aux input... and I can look down, up, around the room as I sing, and always have the vocal have a strong signal, because the mic is always at my mouth. I often wear headphones over the headset mic, so I'm able to work ideas out, again, without having to always sing into a mic on a stand. This is fine in a live situation, but when I'm writing, I want the freedom to move around and hear everything I'm doing. Definitely recommend a headset mic if you mainly use a harmonizer in-studio.		4. The four knobs when you're on the main ("Home") screen control the mixer (volume of all harmonies together, delay/reverb mix, guitar mix, and output level). I didn't even know this was here until I owned the thing for several days. Very useful.		5. The better you sing into it (pitch-wise), the better it tracks and the more realistic it sounds.		6. I've found that singing in a high tenor range yields the best-sounding harmonies (singing notes from B3 to B4). Often, my voice can't go that high comfortably due to ongoing vocal cord issues, but if you're using the 3rd up harmony (the common one), the more "head voice" you have, the better the harmonies sound. This is why female singers always sound amazing going through these things, as they have that gorgeous, perfect vocal range (middle C to male high C). That's the sweet spot, pitch-wise, with most vocal harmonizers, including this one.		-----------------------		THE LIVE LOOPER:	I haven't even messed with the live looper presets or functions AT ALL... but I know it's powerful. I use a looping pedal for live looping, as I mainly use it for guitar parts, and not so much vocals... but this thing can loop both guitars AND vocals, as needed... check out some videos demonstrating this.		-----------------------		SUMMARY:	So yeah, I don't really know what else to say.... as far as harmonizers go, this is the king of them all! For the price, it can't be beat. Sure, you can buy one of those high-end studio rackmount harmonizers for way over 2 grand, but do you need one of those? Probably not. This thing fits the bill for everything I need.... studio, live, etc.		Final note: you can easily do the following songs LIVE with this, with or without MIDI implementation:	- Imogen Heap's "Hide and Seek" (if you have the voice range... as a guy, I don't... but I love her, anyway)	- Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" (especially the intro) and "Somebody To Love" (a popular video site shows a guy doing a one-man-band acoustic cover of STL with the Voicelive 2, and whoa... it's actually extremely impressive!)	- Fleet Foxes "White Winter Hymnal" (with the greatest of ease)	- Ida's "Down On Your Back" (with some painstakingly creative/mathematical programming)	- and many, many more.		Just get it. Some other online retailers have this for hundreds more than Amazon, and other retailers... don't spend more than $600 on this (as of August 2013). It's worth it, believe me... but yeah, the current going price is $600 or less new. It is far cheaper here (isn't everything?). Love you, Amazon. Love you, TC Helicon!
0,Nice thick glass and with better quality control it'd be great. I don't know if mine is a rare flaw, but it has a few tiny tiny little imperfections and look more like air bubbles than chipped glass but are right on the surface and are noticeable when they hit the strings. As long as i make sure to keep the bubbles horizontal to the fretboard it plays fine and makes a nice crisp sound. I'll probably put a wood handle on to hold it with so it's not a big deal, i'm new to slide guitar and have found i prefer to play with the guitar on my lap anyway and this slide isn't really meant to use like that.
0,So far we've used four of these to hang guitars - both acoustic and electric. They are easy to install and hold very well with the included anchors. You really can't beat this price for two.
0,Nice strings that came as advertised
0,Purchased for my new black Epiphone guitar. Looks good, works fine.
0,good little tuner
0,very good, exceeded my expectations
0,This cable is amazing. I love the quality, the look and the tweeded mesh texture. There does not seem to be any noise introduced by the cable. I use this cable on a regular basis. I prefer it over my Monster cable. I see no signal difference between the two cables. Save some money and go with this one.		I use this cable for Studio recordings	Live Worship Sets at my church	Use it on a Taylor 414 & Martin GPCPA4 acoustic Guitars

Ive had pretty good luck with low-cost high-quality no name pickups on Amazon so when I saw this set ready to go I couldn't resist the gamble.		To say I was impressed by these pickups is an understatement. Sporting actual coil splitting and supreme tone variety these give me everything I was looking for and more. I get everything from those overdriven Smashing Pumpkins riffs and blown out Jimi Hendrix tones all the way to beautiful Knopfler and Clapton cleans and crunches.		Installation was a snap, didn't even have to take off the strings! Not a big deal for me since it was a project guitar but the holes didn't line up properly on the body I was using, it may just be my guitar body or the pick guard I got but it's something worth mentioning! Definitely thinking about buying one or two more to stock up on! If you're thinking about a groovy upgrade to your Stratocaster that won't break the bank look no further!
0,fantastic uni vibe pedal...nothn' cheesy about having Jimi's pic on the front! Love this baby!
0,decent for a guitar stand, and a good price for what it is, but you have to watch if you bump it, the guitar will move.  The nice thing is that it doesn't take up as much space as the taller ones that hang the guitar from its neck
0,Excellent! I love it ,  voice sounds good,and good quality.
0,The nut that comes standard on a PRS SE Custom 24 is just plastic, and has to be filed down to work with anything but 9 gauge strings.  I play 10s, so the nut was having major issues with keeping in tune with even the slightest bend.  Based off reviews here and elsewhere, I got this nut and put it in the PRS.  Night and day difference.  It  is (as others have noted) a direct fit for the PRS SE Custom 24.  Just had to gently ping the old nut out and this one fit right in.  Tuned everything up and stretched the strings - no more tuning issues!  Sounds amazing.  Nice to be able to actually bend strings and use the tremolo for the first time on this guitar!  Highly recommended to replace the PRS Korean nut that comes standard on the SE line.
0,Good and reasonable,cheap
0,I would not have found this on Amazon by myself. I saw a friend using this on a shoot so I searched for it on Amazon. Super convenient way to attach a microphone to a light stand. In my case, a fixed boompole.
0,Here comes the... Nevermind
0,It's nice to receive a quality product at an affordable price, I wish each purchase were as satisfying.
0,It is great, not a flimsy wire, heavy duty, I'm glad I got the 25 foot for the price
0,I have other softer straps at more than double the cost. Bought a black one and love it, I hear people complaining about the leather being stiff or shedding. That's what new leather does, it will get softer over time and the shedding will stop	In time or you can knock the pieces off.	I balked up my strap, twisted it and withing a few minutes it was softer. As far as length I'm 6 ft and it works fine for me, I don't play like slash at my knees. I heard complaints about a strong leather smell, I love that smell. It's made in Canada and I couldn't be happier. I just ordered	A brown one, my local guitar shop had the same type strap made in China for $30. I guess to each his own but I can't see how anyone could give this strap less than 5 stars. A great value. I might buy one more sine I have multiple guitars	With different strap lock systems and a couple without. Can't go wrong!
0,Decent inexpensive strings.  Soft feel and take to rosin well.
0,This uke is really nice and a great value. Looks good, setup and playability are great, quality strings and it sounds good too. The gig bag provides enough protection and the tuner works well, better than the one I had just purchased. No problems keeping this uke in tune. Overall a great purchase.
0,I thoroughly recommend this metronome.  I use it every day - I actually bought it because it taps out different rhythms, but to be honest rarely use that function.  What I appreciate is the large clear display - adjustable click sound and volume, and the "tap" function where you tap the button on the top and it displays the tempo.  Also very easy to turn on and off (can hit the large top button out of the corner of your eye).  I have never even thought there was an issue adjusting the tempo.  My only complaint is it doesn't turn itself off, and if you don't it goes through batteries fast!
0,Exactly what I needed.  Using four of these for a four cable method (4CM).  Needed some decent length reasonably priced cables.  These are not transporting diamonds through a special tunnel, its simply guitar audio.  These work perfectly and the added angled end makes them fit perfectly for my application.		Time will tell if they fall victim to the dreaded kink at the guitar end, forcing you to wiggle and move them to get audio as most of my other guitar cables have fell victim to.
0,simple to use
0,good
0,I like the sturdiness of the fabric and zippers. So far, haven't had any problems with rips or broken zippers. In retrospect, I wish I had thrown down the extra money for something with wheels...but that's my own fault :(
0,just right!
0,Excellent effects for the money.  We had one of them about 10-feet high flashing on a small dance floor.  Since it was a bar, they don't want the dance floor to be covered with brilliant light.  This lighting did the trick.
0,Kind of flimsy but other than that it works nice for what I need it to do.
0,Holds and fits like it should
0,always an excellent choice and a great price
0,I have difficulty hearing the cheaper units on the market.  This metronome has 2 distinct audible sounds and a flashing light which makes it much easier for me to see and hear the beats.  Works very well.
0,Great clap for holding mic with goose nick.
0,Works great.
0,ok
0,They're great sticks and would love another pair in another size, also! Perfect for practice, very comfortable, but the dip can come off if things get super intense behind the kit (i.e. gripping hard, heavy sweating, really using the sticks harshly) and get scratched by nails.
0,Very uniqe
0,Wah-wah peddles can be a touchy thing.  It takes time to get good synchronizing your foot with your guitar, but this peddle helps a lot.  Smooth action, clean sound and great effects.  The heavy weight of the base keeps it securely in place.		All in all a great addition.
0,Interesting compressor pedal. Besides the normal volume and sustain knobs there is an attack toggle with 3 positions which impact the slope of attack. You can select from slow, fast or normal. This is useful.		Internally there is a small pot in the upper right hand corner which is critical to calibrate but not mentioned in the instructions. The pedal seems to ship with way to much gain which can create unneeded noise, pulsing and distortion. Here is a useful calibration technique. Do not try this if you are unfamiliar with dealing with electronics.		Take the bottom off (four screws), and set it aside. The trim pot should be at the top-right corner of the circuit board. It's just a small screw in a potentiometer. Use an insulated small screwdriver to adjust it. TINY adjustments make a big difference. You turn it clockwise (right) to DECREASE the input sensitivity, and counterclockwise (left) to INCREASE it (the opposite of what you expect).		With the back off, connect the pedal to a guitar and amp set to the way you'd normally play. It should be a clean channel, with no distortion and no other pedals. Turn the knobs of the pedal so they're both at 12 o'clock, straight up. Set the Attack knob to Fast.		Play some chords on your guitar. While doing this, turn the pedal on and off. Note whether your guitar is louder with the pedal on or off. Probably, it will be MUCH louder with the pedal on. The input sensitivity is too high from the factory. If so slightly turn the screw clockwise to reduce the gain.		Repeatedly check the difference in volume between pedal on and pedal off. Each time, carefully turn the pedal over, without moving the knobs, and adjust that pot. TINY movements. Adjust it until the volume with pedal on and pedal off, and both knobs straight up, is exactly the same (unity gain).		After adjustment, this pedal rocks and is a great compressor at any price.
0,This is the best of what is availbale for a case humidifier. I have tried others and they are not near as good. Throw away the included syringe and buy one with a smaller nozzle at a drug store. Only use distilled water. They stay stay effective for up to 10 days but we keep our house humdified to at least 40% RH.		You can buy replacement crystals at the company website - easy to do.
0,I love this stamp I use it all time.  Great rubber stamp
0,Good quality cable. Have bought same brand before. Always hold up to expectations
0,Super-Great Strings go easy on the fingers and are true to the ear - Make my old Elger sound like I know what I'm doing!
0,killer!!!!!!!!!!!
0,USB OUTPUT was available. I did not expected but really good to have.	Sounds perfect even with my cheap condenser mikes. No thing more, No thing less for home recording / Karaoke / headphone amp.	Perfect amusement company beside my iMac.	I have been using Sennheiser H HDVD800 and HD800. Now, I am using X1204USB for the convenience and voluptuous  sound.		Great product. Nothing to complain.
0,Excellent item: so powerful and great seller support
0,First, I am unapologetic about the difference of opinion which I have with other reviewers. I am a huge fan of this product, both as a midi controller AND as a handy little scratchpad step sequencer. I find the controls responsive, if a little flimsy The solid base gives the product an overall substantial feel. The controls are as intuitive as any midi controller I have used, and when paired with Arturia's midi control software, make this a useful, friendly tool. Yes, there are probably controllers out there with a higher level of functionality -- at four to five times the cost. With cost in consideration, I believe  this to be one of the best dub/beat controllers available, and it is also a great value as a plain, straightforward little step sequencer.
0,*I am loving these strings 	*What I liked:	-The sound really lives up to the marketing	-Great value for money for this type of string	-Easy unpacking with clean clear marking on the packaging for restringing (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)	-Received a follow up note/pdf on string maintenance which was very nice customer service	*What I didn't like as much:	-A pricing sticker ended up covering the list of strings enclosed (I bought .011s) and not a huge deal but wanted to make sure I got what I ordered and a sticker was covering that information so if I had to return it or did not want to open the package right away (I did because I was restringing) It would have jammed up the process  all good in the endfound out it was just an operational snafu that is being corrected...	*Definitely will buy some .012s too because I am working on Slide Blues :-)
0,Works as described.	Place it close to speaker for auto pattern changes
0,thanks worked great I return I will do business with you again what I expected I can recommend to get on time and as described
0,The enthusiastic reviews here may possibly represent a type of listener, instead of the cartridge's performance. In actual comparison with several cartridges at this price level AND higher, this cartridge invariably shows up unnaturally bright and fatiguing.	Its generous tracking ability and freedom from sibilance is a virtue shared with several competitors also.	BUT one competitor shares the great tracking ability together with the nice look of quality manufacturing, more natural (and non-fatiguing) treble, AND substantially lower price. The Denon DL-110 delivers more natural tone and staging, including generous tracking and freedom from the irritating treble tone of this Audio Technica cartridge. The DL-110 is a better performer for a lower price.
0,The TONE on this product is amazing... Always keep clean your neck and strings so they last longer in every way.	<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dunlop-DEN1046-Nickel-Wound-Electric-Guitar-Strings-Medium-010-046-6-Strings-Set/dp/B000VTH526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dunlop DEN1046 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Medium, .010-.046, 6 Strings/Set</a>
0,This is the gold standard amongst podcasters and anyone looking to get that authoritative rumble in their voice recordings. Also all-around great for general recording. You can also kill a soviet bear with it; this thing is heavy and robust.
0,Very nicely made, sounds good, fits good. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is price. Compared to the others, it's rather high.
0,Works well easy to use
0,perfect. very stiff and I worried it would damage the wires when I hooked these up....didn't have to fret it at all. Clear, no noise, no drain, works like it should
0,The rean connectors are solid, and the cable is rugged.  Definitely recommend.
0,Great deal on Martin strings. No brainer. They're great.
0,We have tried several different brands.  For the money, my son prefers the Rico Grand Concert Select reeds.  He plays alto and bari sax - and prefers these for both.  This is a good strength for an intermediate player that switches instruments.
0,this young mula blood black as ruthy and rache0a
0,I REPLACED MY FireStudio Project with this unit... Let me just say that this model by far outperforms it's predecessor. This thing hit the ground running! Outstanding performance. Also very satisfied with delivery.
0,I originally bought this for my electric guitar, but the day it arrived was also the day that I happened to break my string on my acoustic. This tool took the place of 3, pin remover was very nice as the Acoustic had not been restrung in about 15 years, and the pegs were stiff. The Winder saved the wrist a lot of hand motions, and fit easily, and the wire cutter performed exactly as I thought it would, it cut the string. Maybe it was how i cut all 6 strings, but it left a dull end, not a deadly,stinging, scraping end, a nice little bonus.
0,This is a great pick holder. I think I'm going to attach some velcro to the back to get it to stay on my strap, since the adhesive does not adhere well to a cloth strap.
0,Excellent , great buy , will recommend to friends and family.
0,I've been in studios enough to know the difference between the $100+ models of suspension booms and cheapos.  This is NOT a radio station grade boom arm but.... It's GREAT for a small studio.  I use this for my Shure SM58 which I send through a mixer to my computer for skype use.  It's perfect for my office as I'm the only user.  If you're planning on doing a webcast from your home or office - this thing is perfect.		Do note that the head appears to be a 3/8" thread and it does not swivel, the mic just swings on the threads.  The body does pivot at the base though.		Overall, I very much like this as I saved more than 80% on the cost of the other model I considered and am getting the same experience that I needed at this low cost.
0,Arrived promptly and in great shape. The bow my violin kit came with never worked right and was heavy. This was absolutly perfect. I bought it for a back up bow, but is now my main bow as it plays much better than the one my fiddle came with. Played right out of the box with very little resin added. Sounds beautiful. Now I enjoy actually playing the violin as all my hard work sounds like music(even as a learner) rather than screechy cat sounds. It is lighter than the one mine came, easier to control, smoother,.. sweeter sounding and a joy to use. And the price, although not as important as the beautiful sound this bow makes, was the cherry on top of the whipped cream....Thanks Crescent for making this very usable and enjoyable bow accessible for all of us out here who need it.
0,Great cables and the colors makes it easier to differentiate when I'm plugging and unplugging everything.
0,The produce arrived on time and in new condition. I wish the screws were colored the same as the strap lock.  The screws were cheap and even with a new professional grade screwdriver, they were prone to stripping.  Once tightened the system worked flawlessly.
0,After I bought and returned several stands this one I really like...Very sturdy and stable...
0,great repair part and very helpful to label the board
0,This little thing is an excellent solution for connecting a guitar strap to guitars without a strap button at the head end.  It's a great improvement over tying the strap on with some kind of string or shoelace.
0,Good quality for the price.
0,Snugly fits and the padding seems adequate.
0,Warm low tones and bronzey twangs. Nice.
0,The quality of the effects and distortions is great on this unit and the LCD screen is very futuristic I can get great tone on this processor similar to a pod and when hooked up in stereo it sounds like guitars played on a professional rock cd the price is great too,PS check the youtube reviews and judge for yourself!
0,These picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction. It's easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks. give them a shot
0,Product was as expected.
0,Just as described and took about 12 days to be delivered from China.	Really nice to check the setup.
0,Good commercial CD player - We use this as a component to our sounds system at a raceway and it works well. It interfaces with our PA system, Mixer, etc just fine - Balance/or Unbalanced - Remote is handy - Seems to be quality built.
0,Bought these to replace some beat up old sounds. Sound nice enough and have taken a beating so far. No complaints!
0,Very satisfied with this capo.  Sharp looking and built well.  Comes with a handy case for when you're packing your gig bag, but easily clamps onto the headstock during rehearsal or live shows.  Clamping mechanism is solidly made.  Thumbs up here.
0,Nice cover.will help protect from scratches.
1,The Sovtek 12AX7WA came stock in my new Hartke LH1000 bass amp.  Even after several hours of break-in it had a lot of crackle and hiss.  I Almost sent the amp back but I knew the crackle sound came from the tube.  Swapped it out for a Svetlana 12AX7 purchased here on Amazon.  Much less noise.  Zero crackle.  Fairly warm sound.  I'm much happier with the new tube and the amp.
1,Not a very reliable product. One of the LEDs started strobing after two days of use. I wrote the seller about the issue and sent them pictures. They did not even respond. I returned it and bought a different product. Don't waste your time or money.
1,I have a really hard time bending notes on this harmonica, even after adjusting little flaps. I have a dime store chinese garbage harmonica that bends much better. Maybe it's because I am a beginner, or haven't adjusted it right yet.
1,These didn't even withstand one use.		One speaker stand collapsed the first night 2 hours in and dropped my monitor. Will never buy hear again and unless you want them to fal apart and cost you more money in repair damages STAY AWAY
1,Half of them had a slight buzz when used to record audio. Had to upgrade.
1,Something about this harp I don't like, I think because it seems narrow.  The sound is good but not great in my opinion.
1,These are decent sounding tubes, but they aren't matched very well. The pair I got differ by about 15%, I ended up having to make some compromises when biasing. Would not recommend if you need matched tubes.
1,Nowhere near fitting my Washburn
1,They don't fit right and are cheaply made.. don't buy them- they suck!
1,You are better off getting a Yoga mat at $5 Below or a discount store. These are really thin and cheap overall.
1,The deadest strings I ever purchased. I thought they were defective so Dunlop sent me 2 free packs. Both packs were dead too. If you are use to high quality strings like DR, Rotosounds, or Blue Steels you will be disappointed with these.
1,noisy on first use
1,Update:	Keyboard malfunctioning.  F, A, and C# not sounding all across the keyboard.  Very expensive for one year worth of playing.		I wanted weighted keys, and a piano sound, this gave it to me.  I also didn't  want too many extras and drumbeats, and things like that.  This gave me that also.  I really like this.  No need to get it tuned!
1,Flimsy stand.  I ordered two, and they've both broken after maybe 4 or 5 uses.  Was I gentle with them?  Not particularly -- we're working musicians, we don't have time for that.  But I didn't *try* to break them -- they're just very cheaply made.  I have two other types of stands -- for mics and PA speakers -- which have survived the exact same abuse just fine.  These are just junk.		The specific problem is the coupling which attaches the stand to the pole is very easy to twist in a damaging way.  Now, the stand doesn't sit on the pole.  Also, the telescoping parts have no retainer stops on them -- they just come right out!		On the plus side?  They're very light and fold up to a small form factor.  But... not something to rely on.  Time to buy a new one!
1,I really like this at first.  The ability to operate each light independantly added flexibility over the reglar stand lights.  However, after less than 10 uses (maybe 12 hours of light), the bulbs on one side flicker so bad I can't use it.
1,My second disappointment from Mighty Bright - cheap chinese made, loose connections - I had to shake and rattle the lights to work.  Here's some advice - go to local hardware store and buy a snap on lamp with a goose neck, they are cheap and made tough for men in the garage! You will be much happier.
1,Why oh why did I not read the reviews before I bought this. This is not something you can actually play on. This is just something to practice chord shapes on. If your looking for something to play on that you can travel with, this isn't it!
1,Didn't like it.
1,The product would not work the battery placement caused a short  . I had to insulate the battery with electrical tape to make the pedal work properly . Pass on this one folks
1,Definitely good for the price, but the material seems a bit cheap. Mine also came a bit dirty with the "leather" part frayed. Does really affect the usage and it definitely a good strap for 5 dollars		Bit of an update, I've had to stop using the strap because it causes strain on my shoulder and back, really don't recommend this to anyone planning of regular using the strap, or with heavier guitars
1,Hey my pedal came with a Short Circuit, the light blinks and the it stops working.	May you remplace it?
1,the cord on the angled end is made to short to stay in my bass.	i also tried several instruments, it still wouldn't stay in.	i contacted D'addario, teck said they were aware of problem	in some cables, he sent me a new end. very easy to change	just loosen the screw and swap. Now it's a great cable.
1,The picture shows a sound hold cover of some dark material which I hoped would be more flexible  than the brittle clear material that the last one I bought was made of. That one cracked and split. I couldn't be sure what that dark material was, but I hoped it would be better - it couldn't be worse.	I was bummed when I got another clear, brittle plastic cover, just like the last one.	Also, there is no clip on the tube like in the picture. You have to make do with putting the loop of string around the end of the tube.		this is the first time this has happened to me buying from Amazon.
1,Using them for first time the clamps got loose, my daughter told me to return them, stuborn me that insisted and with metal pieces that I have fixed them, ok, first gig, put two SM58 on the clips... they immediately fell and the grilles were damaged and dented. I was so pissed. Anyway the show must continue so I replaced the clamps with 2 shure. It worked. I don't definitively recommend to vuybthis product, in fact I will return it. Is not the amount of money, is the fact thet they didn't work properly since I opened the package.
1,Perhaps it is just this one, but the product is almost useless.  With fresh batteries, it doesn't produce enough torque to turn the tuners.  Also, the trigger switch only works about half the time.  Not worth the effort to use it or the $$ paid for it.
1,Had to return it. There was a strange sound coming out like paper tearing or trickling sand. I even set it with no FX, Voice on Tweed. Treble BAss middle position. Still had that crackling tearing sound.
1,Don't buy this! Only works when you tap on it and then not always! My fault you get what you pay for!
1,For seven bucks, I'd say you're better off getting a roll of masking tape with cash left over for a six pack to keep you on the level while tuning your drums.  The only advantage I see with these is the appearance - they certainly LOOK cooler than masking tape.  Or, if you like the 'adjustable' nature of this product, you can buy a dozen feet of sticky-sided velcro tape and make your own.  The bottom / flat ends of these doohickeys have a small - 3-4mm area of sticky stuff that doesn't adhere very long to the side of your drums, so most of mine are currently on the floor, under my kit.  Unlike the picture, they come in a "variety pack," and the smaller ones are so small that they barely reach my drum heads once the sticky end is adhered to the side of the drum.  I have a Gretsch 'Energy" kit - maybe your rings are shorter than mine, but overall I'd suggest another method.
1,Purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock Martin and it just didn't fit well for me. Also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove. A string style worked a lot better, was a lot easier to attach and remove, and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed.
1,Cheap hangers, will stick to your neck.
1,crap, works only for 1 month
1,This review is on the seller Yorozuya Yokoshima ,not the product. These people posted what seemed like a good price (not ridiculously low) on the Us Dream pedal. It was to be shipped from Japan. They then decided the price was an error and canelled my order. This kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on Amazon.com because the item was less than $4.00 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers Yorozuya Yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item. I am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior. I lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident.
1,this is a first time for me I ordered two packs of these string and both of the #12 strings broke at the ball when I put them on ?
1,Very poor desing and it's not resistant at all. I bought it to take my guitar during a short trip but after 2 days, one of the straps broke.	I do not recommend it.
1,didnt work had to return it
1,I own a couple of these, and a couple N/D767s, and have purchased & use many EV speakers, over the years. I've always liked EV products, but the 967, & EV, have disappointed me greatly. I did get about five years of occasional use, but I have much older mics that just keep working.		I take excellent care of all my equipment, and this is the first mic I've owned that just stopped working. It may have fallen to the floor one time, not from the stand, but from a table a few feet off a carpeted stage, but I guess that was all it took. Cause I went to use it the next night, and nothing, no sound at all.		A friend who does some electronic work opened it up but said the problem must be deeper into it than he wanted to go. I tried contacting EV, on two separate occasions to see how much it might cost if they repaired it, but they never even responded... I'm used to companies standing behind their products, so this was unexpected, and quite disappointing.		I'll probably have to just toss it, as a repair place would probably charge nearly what's it's worth, just to fix it; and who knows how much longer it would last, anyway? Therefore, I can't really recommend this mic, as I won't be buying another from EV...
1,UPDATE,		II bought three of these and they are all dead now.  Stuck on a green screen.  These things suck, get the Snarks, they are way better and last longer.  I see people saying the same thing and apparently it has to do with the battery.... Why should I have to buy new batteries when they aren't even dead yet?  I had this at 4 stars before but now I'm dropping it to one.  Crappy tuners..... you get what you pay for.  Turns out the batteries get used up really quick with these.  I have Snark tuners that last about twice as long.
1,You get what you paid, at first works fine, but after light use (4 or 5 months) at home, begins to fail, dark and muddy sound, scratch noise, until no sound seems to be have very fragile the inner wire.  Maybe for static use works I mean to patch some equipment, but for guitar doesn't work, get a better cable.
1,You'd do just as well with a $20 phantom box, and an XLR to 1/8th TRS cable to your on-board sound card.		Its fair at best. My biggest issue is how much white noise it makes. Its about same as using a cable right from a dynamic mic to your mic-in on an on-board sound card. It also picks up a lot of noise if you use it with a cable vs. plugging it right into the mic, i.e. its not very well balanced. I suspect it is providing a low phantom voltage too, its gain is very weak.		I was able to check the cable and AT2020 condenser mic I used against a high quality interface on the same comp, and they where dead silent so its just not very good.
1,I can't get my guitar tuned with this.  It gets close, but it is not as accurate as my other clip on tuner.  I am an experienced player with a good ear.  I have to tune the last little bit by ear to use this tuner.
1,Fair to mediocre. ATT switch on one unit makes poor contact right out of the box, the 2nd one works . . . for now.
1,2 of 6 connectors wouldnt properly seat in the input jack of various pedals. I moved them to different pedals with the same result. Not sure...
1,I was skeptical of a plastic harmonica, but there were so many good reviews, that I thought I should try it. I reasoned that if it played really nice, I could live with the fact that it's an ugly chunk of plastic.  Well...  Yes, it does come apart super fast and easy without any tools, but aside from that, there is nothing about this thing that impresses (or even satisfies) me.  1. Maybe some are airtight, by mine sure wasn't.  The design prevents any external air leaks, but it still leaks internally (a leak is a leak). 2. The mouthpiece is really thick - like having a big bar of soap in your mouth. Tone is subjective so some might like it, but I hate it - really dull sounding. When you blow through the comb and reed-plates alone, it sounds better, so I think it's that big plastic body that takes all the life out of the tone. 3. Did I mention that it's one big, thick piece of plastic?  UPDATE: Just got a new Seydel Saxony.  Well, compared to the Saxony, the CX12 seems like one of the "prizes" that you'd win for knocking over a bottle at a carnival. The Saxony is nearly twice as much, but it looks, feels, and plays like it cost 20 times as much!  UPDATE 3/16/14:  It's now a year later, and I still LOVE my Seydel Saxony.  Instead of continuously upgrading, just buy the Saxony and be done with it.
1,GHS has a good brand reputation, so I wanted to try these on my P bass. The strings are smooth, and do have a clean, "precision" look to them. I strung them through the body, and still found an issue with the E string. As others have said, it is indeed too long for a Fender-style headstock. I didn't think it would affect the sound, but it did. On the E string, the Open E through G are obviously dampened. The notes past that aren't affected too much, but it's enough of a problem for me to decide to go ahead, after a week, to replace them. $30-something down the drain. Too bad we can't return bass strings.
1,Poor quality. After about 2 weeks of limited use one tone started failing. When I opened it saw that a membrane had broken off. A few others were already corroded. It's cheap but you get what you pay for.
1,Rods fell out of the base on the first count in.
1,Maybe my expectations were too high... as soon as I plugged it in I smelled something burning.	Pulled the plug and just use a battery...and yes, it was the proper fitting cord.	It works, but now I'm hesitant to try any other Behringer product.
1,Plain and simple don't waste your money on this amp. I put on Classic Car Shows and need a good amp to project sound and this amp pegs out with little volume. My qsc amp blows the doors off of this one. It is only a 250 watt amp not 2000. Not happy with this product at all. they offered to replace it but I would have to pay shipping which is almost as much as the amp.
1,GARBAGE!!! NEARLY DESTROYED MY AMP WITH GLITCHY ELECTRONICS.
1,Very Disappointed with this microphone. Admittedly I didn't expect much, but it's even worse - in fact it's not usable. Do NOT buy this microphone. I was looking for an omni-directional microphone and this seemed to be my only inexpensive option. I was hoping that Pyle would make an inexpensive omni, but I couldn't find one. I do like their directional mike the PDMIC58 which is very good. This microphone is going in the trash.
1,WiFi is so unstable and unresponsive. I can connect to the DR-44WL WiFi using my iPhone6 with no problems and can start recording using the DR Control app however I cannot stop the recording because the WiFi connectivity is lost. In order to make it work again, I need to reconnect my iPhone6 to the DR-44WL access point over and over. Please update the WiFi Firmware to allow the device to connect to an existing WiFi. Another problem with the concept of device being the WiFi access point is that you don't have internet connection when your phone is paired with the DR-44WL.
1,I have used Elixer Nanoweb strings for many years, but I will not purchase them again. 3 sets have developed rough strings at the pick area in less than a week.  I am very disappointed with the quality. Something has changed. I am switching to another manufactures coated strings that don't degrade like the Elixirs.
1,very fragile. ust stopped working after a few months. AVOID!!
1,I must say I'm very surprised that no other reviewers have pointed this out yet. This thing is HEAVY. I have 3 DW double-braced cymbal stands and I can't put this thing on any of them. The stand immediately falls to whatever side I put it on, even when I attach it without a cymbal in it. Perhaps my stands aren't the best in the world, but I've used other arms that have worked just fine. This thing is way too heavy. I don't know what kind of stands everyone else is using, but this just won't work for me.
1,I used this once and as I took it out of the jack it fell apart into 3 pieces. I managed to put the pieces back together, and it fell apart again. I see several other people have had the same experience. An item like this is not worth the time and effort to return.
1,the 1 hole doesnt produce sound when blown through and leaks air. this was $12 with shipping, what a waste. i bought this as a gift and now i have nothing to give, lame!
1,It is possible to get a passable overdrive sound out of this pedal, but the only way I could do it was to crank all of the dials all the way to the right (there are 3 pots). The problem with that is the noise floor of the device rises significantly in this mode.  You can't get any other sounds out of it that are worthwhile.		Compared to higher priced pedals of the same type (Boss BD-2, Keeley Phat Mod) it doesn't offer a range of tones you might expect from a Blues Overdrive. A used BD-2,  can be had for just a little more than twice the price, so it's hard even justifying the modest cost of this pedal.		It's a personal preference, though. Some players don't have enough scratch for something with the same properties of the nicer devices, but if that's the case, maybe you can save a lot of money by playing with just your amp's overdrive. You wouldn't be the first.
1,I played these strings for like three months and still don't sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I've also been watching all his old interviews on YouTube and not once does he admit to the fact that he would have been nothing without this particular gauge of strings.  Nor does he cop to the fact that he used a plain 20 for the G string.  I am not impressed.  I will never play 13s again until I hear an official apology from his estate.  Music used to mean something, man.
1,I can't believe this is marketed to people who want to learn to play. Terrible sound, leaks air everywhere, weighs about half as much as the nearly as cheap $8.00 Chinese made Blues Band or the Old Standby. Don't waste your money on any of them. You will never play it long enough to learn anything. They take too much air to play, lose notes, and sound cheap. Piedmont is the worst.	If you even THINK you might want to learn, spend the $35.00 +/-, and get a good one. Blues Band MS, Marine Band, or Special 20.	These are pro models and sound much better, very nice tones. They take less air to play also.	Those cheap ones are cheap for a reason. Kids toys.	P.S. Don't buy a used one. You don't want to put a stranger's spit in your mouth, do you?
1,There's a reason this is less than forty dollars. The unit I received may very well have been defective, but I didn't want to take my chances on another cheap pedal. Might as well just buy a pedal from the people who know how to make pedals (Boss) and be done with it. This unit picked up radio interference, and quite easily overloaded the signal. Not sure if that's the right way to explain it, but with too much distortion or level, it would just cut out, like it was too much. Tried on multiple amps and cables to rule out -- it was the pedal. Even with the levels on very low, it lacked any sort of body like a guitar should have. Not worth it, back it goes.
1,Man, this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks! DO NOT BUY - it is a wast of money... ug!
1,Little update : So I kept trying and looking on the internet. I read about how it's a bad idea to tweak a tone through headphones and that one should use monitors. I live in a small appartment and I play a semi hollow with it's own sound, so I can't use monitors at neighbour-friendly levels. I found a topic about open back headphones being the best alternative, looked more and apparently line 6 recommend high impedance headphones		So I got myself a beyerdynamics dt880 (600 ohm) the quality of the sound improved a tiny bit but still these boxy cleans and harsh fizzy distortions.		Meanwhile I spent more time on Amplitube 4, especially the cab room and man what a tone machine this is. The double mic placement for the speakers plus the room mics which add their own reverb beat hands down any overeqed patch you'll find out there for pod HD.		I managed to get the tone I was looking for.but it' entirely using amplitube. Pod hd is lying on the ground as a volume pedal/tube comp, waiting for someone to buy it to get a midi pedalboard.		Anyhow the only use I think of for this piece of junk is as a fx pedal board with no amp sim, straight into a real amp.		Amp sims with a midi pedalboard are all you need if you're jammig at home.( I also tried bias amp demo and it rocks!)		-----------------++++++++++++++++++--------------------		 I bought this because I was compelled by the idea of a computer made specifically to process guitar sounds, felt as an upgrade to my computer gear. I mainly play through headphones(small appartment) using amplitube, and felt that the distortions weren't good enough on that software.		I'm a bit of a geek, so I wasn't put off by the learning curve everyone is talking about.		I'm looking to simulate a tone created originally with a soldano sl60 and a fender 412 cab. volume pedal is used to go between clean and distortion		I managed to get what sounded like a good tone, and then I played a song using the tone I'm looking for, it was a fail...	First, was the dynamics you get on tube amps, they are inexistant, you won't get a distorded note if you pluck it harder, you're either in clean or in distortion, you'll get at best a very weak distortion, more annoying and irritating than anything (I know I'm being picky here)		The biggest problem is the overall tone this thing produces		"half way depressed wah pedal", love the expression the guy that gave this tool of torture 2 stars used. that's exactly what it sounds like		 I spent 5 days in a row doing nothing but trying to get rid of that ridiculous tone. It sounds as if the sound is coming from a bottle. I don't even know how to describe it with words... muddy? boomy? boxy? The thing is, this thing sounds bad, and I fiddled with every possible setting, tried all the eqs, filters, different amps and cabs, nothing, still sounds the same...	I compared it with an old recording I did with amplitube,the tone was way much better than what I got with POD.	So yeah, I feel at loss, everyone seems to enjoy this device, but I feel like you need a sound engineering degree to get anything decent out of it. It's frustrating, this thing has a ton of options, not one seems to solve my issue. and I went through practically every tutorial and article out there about pod hd, and equalization in general.		I really wanted to love it. It's 500 dollars invested. I don't live in the US, so I can't send it back for a refund. I'll probably spend some time with it, and then sell it.		Bummer
1,This pedal leaves me wanting more.  It has a nice crunch to it, but notes die off quick - the sustain is abysmal.  I used it linked up with a tube-based boost pedal, which gave some ok sustain, but finally the Tube Monster from my pedal board.
1,yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable.
1,These only fit certain saddles. Didn't fit mine. Only sent me 11 and not 12. Kinda takes the fun out of it!!!
1,Bought this a few years ago.  At first it was fine but now the top has warped and the action is so high it cannot be played.  Took it to a luthier and he said it was defective and would not even attempt to fix it.  The wood on the top is very thin and not properly supported.  Contacted Kala and they refused to do anything at all.  Since I cannot play it, sell it or fix it, I volunteered to give it back to them for research.  They refused saying they no longer made this particular model.  No discount on a new instrument.  They offered nothing.  I am very disappointed in the product and the customer disservice.  Will not buy another Kala EVER and would not recommend to anyone.
1,NECK	The nut was missing. I had to by a new one: ~$20 (bone) from SM. The holes were not good, especially the ones for the tuning pegs they were touching each other. A lot of hammer work to get them in. The neck wasn't fitting in the body. A lot of work required to make it even and fitting in the body. The neck is overall well done, some work on the frets and a lot of lemon oil to apply but at the end the fretboard is good and the shape is confortable. I cut the top of the neck to have a Fender Telecaster shape. I'm very proud of it..... because it looks really nice. The original shape is really horrible.....		BODY	The shape is good and the pieces (pickup and pickguard) are fitting well. The only problem was that some holes where not straight leaving the head of screws oblique. I applied some copper tape inside the pickups and electronics holes to avoid the radio effect: 20$ from SM. I had to buy 2 new Guitar Strap Buttons because the one in the kit were horrible and with too short screws.		PICKUPS and ELECTRONICS	The electronic is not working well, the thin E string doesn't sound on the bridge pickup and the tone tune doesn't work at all. The output jack is really bad.... I keep it, but I'm planning to buy a new one.		STRING AND BRIDGE	The bottom holes in the bridge are missing so you need to replace the string with bullet strings (I bought the Fender vintage bullet strings) to have them in the right position. But I'm planning to make the holes. I have already bought String Ferrules from SM ($7/8). The 6 Saddle Bridge Chrome is not working well and setup the action and the intonation is really hard and I really prefer the 3 Saddle.		PICKGUARD	I didn't like the pickguard white so I bought a black Fender Telecaster original part, but it doesn't fit in the holes (grrrrrr!!!!), so I had to finish the white one in black.		FINAL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION	At the end around 40 hrs of work to get it done.....It was my first one, so now I won't do the same mistakes again. What I can say is a lot of fun...... but a Squier......it sounds better and costs almost the same and at end it is a Fender....	So if you like to do some manual work, my suggestion is buy it. If you are looking for a good guitar you need to replace original pieces so you need to be sure that you can afford:	- new pickups and electronics,	- new bridge,	- new strings,	- good finishing and lacquer technique		My suggestion is to buy from SM the body and the neck and from Fender all the original parts. It will cost you more but it will be your real Custom Guitar....
1,Cheaply made.. Some times works good (on Fender Strats) Other guitars it does not..	I would not buy again !!!
1,It does the job well enough for the price and it's very straightforward to set up. I'm sure a more expensive setup comes with more ease of use and longevity, though.		Update after a few months: It does the job on a budget, but do not expect to use this thing forever. Highly recommend that you get something of a higher build quality if you plan on using it multiple times a week.
1,I was really looking forward to trying out the Behringer UO300 after watching a product demonstration on Behringer.com. Sadly, this pedal did not live up to my hopes, there was this weird light clicking noise every time I would play a note or a chord that I found overly distracting. I have 9 Behringer pedals counting the UO300, and a couple of those have a similar issue but nowhere near as noticeable as the issue with the UO300. I'll probably look into purchasing a more reputable octave pedal in the future.
1,Having a devil of a time getting one that works.  The first one I had was temperamental.  The second one (received today) is DOA.  I even checked the battery terminals, no dice.  I will change my review if I get one that works but at this point it's clear they have really poor QA so best of luck.
1,I have several instruments hanging on the wall with other companies' hangers.  I won't be adding to them with the Gator Cases hook, nor plan on replacing any of them with it.		The Gator Hook is a solution in search of a problem.  While it provides a tidy appearance by hiding fasteners, it does so only at the cost of some integral wobbliness in the hook's connection to the inner steel plate, which is unacceptable, by creating some risk of the hook not being screwed in sufficiently, also unacceptable, and by just a bit off sloppy workmanship in the hole through the wood cover plate - it actually isn't completely hidden by the hook's shank cover on my sample.		Where does the wobble come from?  Simple.  The hook simply screws into a threaded hole in the (stamped) mounting plate.  Like almost any threaded fastener, if you don't tighten it completely, it wobbles.  On the Gator Cases hook, you CAN'T tighten it completely (unless you're lucky) - you can only screw it in so far and still leave the hook upright.  On my sample, that's not completely tightened ... so it wobbles.  And since the connection is covered, you can't really tell if it's fully engaged in the mounting plate threads, or perhaps literally hanging by a thread.  On a more conventional hanger, the hook doesn't screw in - it's inserted upside-down using a stud and slot arrangement, after which you rotate the hook upwards.  If it's up, it's secure, pure and simple.		My current hangers are the stud and slot type.  Mount the plate, insert the hook.  Done.  Simple and visibly secure.  With the Gator Cases hook, you stick on a foam pad, mount the inner plate to the wall, put on the cover, slip on the hook shank cover, and screw in the hook.  Not so simple and not visibly secure.  If some gives the hook a few spins and you go to hang up your instrument ... well, you're not going to be happy.		If Gator Cases can fix the minor workmanship issues and come up with a visibly secure hook, fine.  Until then, I pass.		Not recommended.
1,$15 for a pedal that gets adequate reviews seemed to good to be true. I guess it is. Package arrived intact and looked fine. Pedal appears to be brand new. I received it, slapped in a battery and ... nothing. Tried a couple of other batteries as well thinking I'd grabbed a dead one, but no luck. Dead pedal, not dead battery.		I wasn't expecting an EHX level pedal for $15, but I at least expected it to function. Zero QA testing at Danelctro apparently.
1,not recomended is not stronger ,, and the seller refuse to provime a refund
1,cable didn't work.  wasn't good quality work making it.
1,This thing gives your amp a ton of noise in the background, even when the pedal is off.	Not recommended...
1,Horrible.
1,Hi Fans, The description of this amplifier makes my mouth water. It's portability means several  less roadies on the tour bus. A 150 watt  rig with an 8" speaker! This amazing technology will fill the largest venue with sweet throbbing sound waves. It also features an on/off switch with LED indicator!  A carrying handle, too!?! Unheard of!!! I would recommend buying several of these; since they're so portable, you could have them all together or move them apart with little effort. It is surely a "Pyle" of something warm, brown, and smelly.		Pegleg Dave
1,Basically what it looks and feels like. Bought this unit thinking i can use it in my studio instead of	much older, more expensive and bigger BR-1200CD or BR-1600CD but I was disappointed with build	quality and changes to the control design. E.g. flat touch-buttons which are actually very unreliable.	You never know if you pressed then or not. The whole unit feels very light and "plasticky", the faders	are wobbling etc. BR-800 has some nice sound effects good mostly for guitarists or vocals, ability	to record 4 channels at a time is good too but overall build quality, the 6 faders instead of 8,	limited editing options make this recorder basically a recording toy.
1,I was disappointed with this product. One of the floor drums did not work at all.
1,I bought many strings the last 2 weeks and this is one of them. These strings have no life in them. I like other d'addarios but not the coated one. Now I am mainly using Martin S54050,D'addario EJ13, Or Gibson Masterbuilt 11. All custom 11 gauge on my Seagull Rustic Mini Jumbo.
1,Returned.  Latency was horrible.  Purchased a different usb interface device for my guitar to pc DAW setup.  Uses basic ASIO driver.  Would not recommend.
1,First off, I'm a huge fan of D'addario. I have them on everything I own. The description claims to fit "up to 32" scale" but I put them on my 32" ibanez acoustic/electric and each string had an inch or more of the cloth wrapping on my fretboard.
1,This pedal provides bass, mid and treble controls, something I needed because my Bugera 5w tube amp only has a generic tone control. In addition, it provides what is called a voicing control, which just gives you some more tonal options, and a gain boost. This is a very useful pedal for me. As to providing you with the tone of an Vox AC30 amp, I can't speak to that. I've never used an AC30.		Amended Review: I had to return the first pedal because it stopped working after a couple of months. But I liked the pedal so much, I received another. But this pedal has also quit working after just a few months, and it has not been used very much. I am extremely disappointed in Joyo's quality control and I cannot recommend their pedals.
1,Did not install on Windows 7 32 bit and 64 bit or on Vista 32 bit or Windows XP. The instructions said the operating system will automatically detect and install the drivers. But on all these operating systems I got a message that a driver could not be found.		Returned it and ordered the EMU XMIDI 1X1 USB MIDI Interface, which was considerably more expensive. The difference was that it worked right out of the box. To my mind that's a rather critical difference :-)
1,Bought 2 of these both broke within 3 months.
1,This thing sounded great while it lived.  It died within 60 days of light use.  Seriously....and my amazon return window just ended.  Disappointing as I have the Ultimate Drive and that's been solid.
1,Button does not work- the thing just goes all the time.
1,very disappointed. this item is cheap. it doesn't stay on, and I usually find it lying on the living room floor.
1,Originally I gave this a different review, but after learning more and testing this power supply with my volt meter someone needs say this is misleading and definitely not the truth.  This power supply does NOT have isolated outputs.		Shame on AGPtek, or L-Fine or Uxcell or Hricane or Beaspire or Andoer....  LOL or any of the (ahem) manufacturers that attach their names to this same piece.		I've only used this for a year or so until the random clicks and pops and other assorted noises started piling up as my board grew, the only physical problems I've had with it are these:		 The power cords aren't long enough	 Two power cords have shorted out	 The wall adapter for the power supply was broken and wouldn't stay together (I taped it)		Other than that you'll save a lot of money buying this vs a real pedal board power supply,  and those are expensive,  I just spent 400 on a modular power system,  so this MIGHT be worth it to you.
1,Snapped in two while I was trying to install it. Wasn't using tools, just my hands. So kinda fragile.
1,I own a tobacco sunburst version of this guitar that I purchased a few years ago through Ebay & I was very pleased with it. I bought it as cheap backup/travel guitar so I could leave my other "expensive" guitars at home. It's the same company - BG Guitars, model Viper & it was a great deal then and I still play it today. It's really agreat value for a guitar under $100.	I ordered this purple guitar as a gift for my friend who's never owned an electric. She herself is an advanced beginner & I'm giving her lessons.	Since this was a gift, it was especially disappointing as a "first electric guitar"  The guitar was solid black in color with a slight hint of purple (which you could only see by holding it up to the light at a certain angle).	Furthermore - the frets are unfinished and have sharp edges so you scratch your hands/fingers as you play.		Big difference from the guitar I bought years ago.  I think I probably just got a bad one out of the batch this time around.
1,I was very disappointed with this purchase and had to return it, the guitar had cracks where the neck connects to the body and a crack under the front pickup. I loved the body style of the guitar and the price, but unfortunately it was damaged. Your experience if you've ordered the item may be different from mine, at least I would hope so, to avoid the deep disappointment I felt.
1,I only tried the A string - since these are expensive I thought I'd start with one string.  I hated it.  It sounded shrill and tinny.  I tried these on two different violins.  I have since read that the remaining strings are superior to the A (they'd have to be).  I'm wondering if I just got a bad string?
1,I was in love with this thing until the shoulder strap broke after a gig.  My mixer was in there, and it hit the ground pretty hard.  I haven't checked to see if there is any damage yet - but needless to day, I'm disappointed.  It looks like the area where the strap is sewn just came unraveled.  The rest of the bag seems fine.  I wonder if I can just buy a sturdy shoulder strap.  Either way, the one that came with the bag is crap...
1,I bought this and it stopped working after a year of medium to light use and most annoyingly it changes the note I am trying to tune to while I'm trying to tune. Total junk.	A waste of 12 bucks.	Get a tuning app and tune by ear.	This thing is worthless.	Plastic crap.
1,I ordered this from the Amazon warehouse as a refurbished item. It was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together. The glue didn't  hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel. This was unfixable so I sent it back for a refund. Warehouse deals are not such good deals.
1,Had this less than a year. Sound engineer often complains about lack of output from my instruments and pulling this unit solves the problem. Just not reliable enough for stage use. Also, it's not smart enough to recognize when I want to take the E (6th) down to D - it just sits there blankly.
1,Very, very light.
1,It was wrongly described as being able to accomodate a nut width of more than 2".  It did not fit my guitar neck and was a waste of money.  Others also indicated it had been wrongly advertised in the reviews.
1,BZZZZZZZ...pause....BZZZZZ.	This is my second Pitchblack Poly, and both have had serious noise issues. Engage the tuning mode, and it's whisper quiet...until the guitar feeds a signal into it, and then BZZZZZZZZ.		Really annoying.		I guess I have to go buy a new tuner.
1,Personally I love D'Addario strings, but I thought I would try something new so I got these. I myself didn't like the coating, or the sounds as much as the strings I'm used to... I actually hated these and couldn't wait to get them off my guitar, but they also sounded brighter, and I like a warmer sound. Strings are trial and error, so try them out for yourself, because a lot of people love these.
1,Has never worked since I bought it. Complete waste of money. It'd be cool to hear back from the company seeing as they sent me a faulty unit.
1,Cheap. No grip to them at all. Spend a little more for a better strap.
1,I tried this on several amps and different guitars. in each case, it created a hum or buzz that was intolerable. I sent it back.
1,I'm having some of the same problem that other people are having. Random crashes and sound problems. In my case it often takes down my entire system. I'll be playing a YouTube vid, pause it, and do something else for a while and come back to the vid, but suddenly, no sound. I was trying to restart the unit when this happened by pulling the power, but this would blue screen my system of all things. It seems like the power switch on the unit may work better at not crashing my system, but I'm not sure. It's very frustrating to buy something from a supposedly reputable company only to have it crash my system when I attempt to restart it.		I happen to be running Windows 10. I'm a computer professional and have been most of my career. The unit/driver combination for this unit is simply not stable. I'm hoping that driver updates improve the situation.
1,It's overpriced cheap plastic. It does the job though. I need to buy a separate peice to mount it how I would like it. I'm still using a snare basket for my alesis sample pad 4 because of that.
1,I bought this to use this with the irig2 but to much cables. They could make this better..
1,Nope, not worth it. I tried powering only 4 pedal with is (overdrive, delay, reverb, and a tuner) and I got more noise than from just using regular cheap links.
1,I normally use D'Addario EXL-125 strings, but one of my guitars is a replica Hentor Sportscaster - the famed hot-rodded Strat that was the #1 guitar Alex Lifeson of Rush used in the 80s. Even though I've had good luck with the EXL-125's, I learned that Lifeson used these strings in these gauges on the original Sportscaster, so I decided to give them a try just for the heck of it, and in the spirit of seeing if I could get the replica to sound more accurate.		At the end of the day, I can't tell a really big difference in sound between these and the D'Addarios.  But the Blue Steels break *way* easier than the EXL-125's - and I don't break strings in normal changing and playing. I can't remember the last time I broke a string playing out. These broke just stretching them after putting them on. Now, I break the occasional G, B, or high E when stretching, even D'Addarios, but even being extra-careful with the Blue Steels, I broke a brand new B while stretching after changing strings, and then broke the B out of the NEXT pack I opened to replace it. So I used all three packs I bought in one string change.		So these strings are great if you have a guitar tech and a Dean Markley endorsement and you get as many packs as you want for free, because eventually you'll get a set of them on a guitar without breaking, but for the guitarist on a budget or the stereotypical "starving artist," I find that the D'Addario EXL-125's sound almost exactly the same and stand up to normal usage a lot better.
1,1 Cable of 2 was defective.
1,At first, this seemed like a decent gig bag, but then the zipper completely crapped out.  You get what you pay for.  Spend a wee bit more money and get something a little bit nicer.
1,Its Kr@p ----	thats the simplest /quickest/EZ review you need or want wit this joke,toy,trinket ....	i hate to admit it but to save other Bass Katz wasted time and humiliation ---- this is one road you cant travel on the Cheap!!!	that said the only solution for really good synth (limiter/filter/pass fx) is to probably spend minimum 150$ ---	you will never be happy with this garbage that companies throw out to the frugal searcher of  bass "slappy-funky-fuzzy-synth" sound	 it will make you very angry though!! --- what it is : these WILL work well with  Guitars (reason: they almost everyone work on a freq level that is "high")	thats why they sound so krappy on a BASS .....so ---- if yer wanting to use it for guitar (it's ok/tolerable/) but for bass/low freqs its a total POS
1,For this price, I couldn't expect anything better. I am not a huge fan of the china sound in general and this one is particularly ugly. Depending on the style of playing, it could fit in really well, but I don't play anything that requires a lot/any china at all, just wanted to experiment with the sound. I would recommend getting a better quality china if you were serious about incorporating this type of sound into your playing.
1,The second day I turned it on the noise was back even worst then ever.  If i just touch the reducer pedal or the amp or guitar plug it makes a loud noise. after I install the noise reducer I took it out, and there is less noise then with it in line . took it apart to see if there was a bad connection.. it has a 1/8 steel plate on bottom when removed this thing weights nothing. Opened it up and looked inside very cheaply made plastic plug ends for amp & guitar. Says designed in Germany but all part are China junk..Will not last long if you unplug it much. I am not happy with this produce. I have a Behringer tuner and its works Great. I would not recommend buying this pedal.
1,Would not stay plugged in to the back of my Taylor, and couldn't figure out why. Just could not get a secure plug in connection.
1,Keep your money
1,it broke two month later
1,A waste of money.
1,It's an OK microphone. But it's not a good deal when you take the price into the consideration. It's not obviously better than those low-end $25 microphone. So you pay a double not don't get a significantly better product.
1,Great functions.  Crapped out on me... AGAIN!!!
1,I might have done something wrong...	I read in a review that these hold six picks.	It held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart...	I'll just keep using my pockets.
1,I'm not an experienced musician and I could even tell this was assembled very hastily and cheaply.  The frets were off center and the thin E string on the bottom weren't even on the neck.  Very disappointed as this was a christmas present.		Oh yeah, I forgot to also mention that one of the clips to hold the string down on the head wouldn't stay on because the hole for the screw was too large.
1,As soon as I got the uke I was so excited to play it. Obviously it took some time to stretch but when I finally got it there, i had a problem. Every single string had a horrible buzz on the first fret. Unplayably horrible. I emailed the company to see what could be done because I wanted this uke so much. A week later and absolutely no response.		Broken, garbage product. Awful, unresponsive company. I will NEVER be so stupid as to buy from this company again. Even now I wish the uke worked. But to doesn't and the company doesn't care of their products arrive BROKEN. So I'm returning it. Thank you for absolutely nothing, Kala.
1,Worked well for about two weeks, then it would start picking up less sound until it finally would NOT pick up any sound at all
1,This tool has the same aggravation as the previos version.  The wire cutter has no return-spring in the handle making the tool a PITA to use.  Open the handle... >snip< Open the handle... >snip< Open the handle...  ARRRRGH!		Seriously guys, you have a great idea, now execute it properly!  I don't know why, but the picture made it look like they added a handle spring, but NOOO, Suckered again.  Now I'm stuck with it because it'll cost too much to return.  Buyer beware, you're better off buying a cheap pair of wire cutters than this 'pro' tool.
1,You get what you pay for.
1,Arrived DOA so I don't know how it works but that's not a good start. Amazon refunded in full for it.
1,Strings 5 and 6 (b and high e) broke as I was putting them on, not as good as the EXL 140s. unfortunately cant afford to buy a new pack to restring my PXD void 1.
1,If this did nothing more than consistently mix volume levels this device would be of value.  However, as noted by other reviewers, it sometimes actually LOWERS volume levels and reduces tone levels.  Here are my experiences:		* Despite being powered by a 9v battery, it doesn't seem to work with condenser mics at all.	* I tried to use it to moderate the volume (or even increase it, considering it's powered) of my passive-pickup classical guitar.  While it sent the signal through and did control the volume (to an extent), it actually lowered the overall guitar volume and clarity.  The guitar actually performed better when jacked straight into the amp.	* Hooking up a self-powered condenser mic to this unit resulted in distortion and "clipped" sound.	* Several users report hooking this up to a stereo output results in one of the channels being cut.  That's inexcusably bad design.  Although advertised as a mono unit-- it should still play the same sound through both channels.  This one flaw alone places this unit on the Z list of equipment.		So basically, all this is good for is... uh.. well, I can't think of anything it would be good for on a practical basis.  Using a non-condenser mic and standard electric guitar?  (dunno, I don't own one).  Whatever, it is extremely limited in function and even when it does work, it tends to lower and distort the original signal.		I rarely compare one product with another, but to be perfectly honest the Behringer 302 or 502 mini-mixer-- although more than double the cost-- is greatly superior to this unit and would be worth the extra money, since both models serve as preamps and have phantom power supply.  Significantly more versatile than this unit-- which doesn't even perform the limited function it's supposed to perform.		It's a shame.  If this unit actually worked as a versatile mini-mixer, the portability would make it very useful for street performers.  As its stands, I honestly don't know why they even produced the thing.  I had high hopes for this device, but I'm sorry to say the low reviews on this product are accurate.		Believe the negative reviews.  This is a poorly-designed, badly-performing product. As with many others here-- I'm still looking for a decent, basic-function battery-powered mini-mixer.  We don't need much; plug in three or four devices, individual volume controls (tone would be nice but not essential), preamp the output, provide phantom power for condenser mikes.  If no one in the USA can seem to do this, anyone in CHINA listening?  ;D
1,These reeds squeak and emit a strange pitch. We usually buy Rico reeds and will in the future. Maybe we got a dud pack, but you get what you pay for. Lesson learned.
1,timely replacement of 9 v with screws, not very accurate hard to use
1,I play a six string bass.  This tuner does not work at all for the 6th B string, does not work well with the 5th E, barely works with the first four strings & it barely gets by on my acoustic six string guitar.  Who wants to sit there for 5 minutes to tune a guitar or bass?  They expectation is for a tuner to tune between songs immediately.  This tuner does not meet that expectation.
1,Convoluted and confusing. Getting the recorded music off the device is a long, tedious process. Lost music in the process. Want a recorder? Buy a zoom. Want a portable multitrack recorder...? get a tablet.
1,I purchased these awhile ago, just put them on, the 4th and 6 BOTH broke! I have restrung my guitar many times. NEVER had this happen.	Will not be buying them again.
1,I have yet to figure what this works on.
1,I bought this thing for my Fender acoustic which is my first and only guitar that I've played on for 6 years now. It doesn't have a pickup built into it. As I started getting involved in the worship ministry at church, I needed some way to amplify my acoustic sound. Because I'm a regular bassist, I didn't want to invest too much into a new acoustic-electric (although I would love one). And micing the guitar was nice but inefficient because I move around a lot when I lead worship. So I did some researching and came across this pickup. I took people's words for it and bought it. The pickup works. But it picks up waay too little signal. When I plug it into a DI, I literally have to put the gain up 95% of the way and then crank it up in my monitor to hear my guitar. And because the gain is so high, I get unnecessary noise.  I plugged it into my bass amp and same deal, gotta crank it up real high to actually hear my acoustic. However, aside from the noise, it sounds pretty nice with right EQing and compression. For now, I'm gonna stick to just micing it with a 57. Sounds way better.		So I don't know if mine is just a dud or if this pickup is just poorly built.
1,I installed staggered locking tuners, which actually made these a moot point.  But instead of having two screw holes in the headstock, I got these just for looks.  They look alright, but I'm not inordinately impressed.  They certainly look nicer than the stamped stock ones, they look like they produce less friction, but I don't believe they have rollers, they merely have a knob on each side the string runs under.  If you're really going to use them, you might want to keep looking until you run across some with real rollers.  I thought these had rollers.  They appear to and I've read in blogs they do.  Otherwise for looks and bragging rights, these say "FENDER" (add$$).
1,Purchased for a cellist -- it slides across the floor and is useless in concerts on a hard floor.
1,I think this is a very good stand, sturdy, easily adjustable (once you get the hang of it), and with the carrying bag, it's easily transported.	I took two stars off, perhaps temporarily. The adjustment screw for the legs has become stripped, so no longer works. This, and the one often used to adjust the top part are the bane of portable stands. I've owned far too many that became unusable, due to stripped adjusting screws, and am disappointed that I've experienced it yet again, with this one. I've had mine a few years, have only used it a couple times a week, so it should still be functional. I do see the new model has an improved mechanism for securing the legs, so I assume they realized what the weak point was, and corrected it.		I will contact Hercules, and if they send me a new part, so the stand will once again work properly, I'll boost the rating up to 5 stars, as I've learned in my years of performing, that customer service is an important aspect of owning equipment. I'm hopeful, as most music equipment companies will take care of the pros who use their products, but there's always one here or there who won't, so I'll see...		Well, it's now been months, and after a couple return emails, one asking for a picture of the part needing replacing, I've never heard back from them, despite a couple more follow-up emails. I spend a lot of money on musical instruments and equipment, and expect a decent level of customer service, which is usually the case with most companies, however, because of their inability to communicate, much less get me the replacement part, this will be the last piece of Hercules equipment I will purchase..
1,Wish there was a detailed printed manual included with this product. I had to rely on youtube videos to understand the product.
1,Another China made imposter. Hard to go green when all this garbage ends up in the landfill. Sounded great til it quit working
1,Even though it said economy in the listing, we were not expecting something quite this cheaply made. Probably fine for a younger child as a toy, but not a good musical instrument for someone who really wants to use a ukulele.
1,I like the idea of the device, but unfortunately it's not complete in terms of who will use it. It doesn't have a USB connection to connect a majority of my small portable devices. The one device I did have that would go with MIDI in/out was my Axiom Air 49. Unfortunately, that did not work either. The setup was not easy. I kept losing the wireless connection after it took forever to find it. It's a good idea, but it still needs work for it to be used with portable keys, finger pads, and other equipment. When they update the product I might give it another try, but until then, it's pretty useless.
1,They all sound like gongs when you hit them. Can only use plastic brushes to make them sound useful.
1,Kinda cheap.
1,The mushrooms are a little undersized. There fore the hole threw them is small and the screws that came with them were aslo short.	I was able to find longer brass screwsat the hardware store so they could mount more securly into the wood. So i have to rate them onle 2 stars.	My suggestion would be to beef them up. They hold a precious commodity, my Fender guitar!
1,terrible sound
1,COMPLETE JUNK! WON'T DO WHAT IT SAYS, MUTES OUT AND BUZZ'S END TO END, RINKY RIVIOT IN CENTER, SPRING GETS SOFTER AS YOU SQUEEZE IT A FEW TIMES. IN PROCESS OF RETURNING BOTH.
1,Usable, but pretty much rubbish!
1,Did not fit on my standard 9-string
1,Very misleading description to say "D'Addario EJ53S Pro-Art Rectified Ukulele Strings, Hawaiian-Concert" (which makes it appear like the strings are for a CONCERT sized uke), and then actually have them be soprano sized strings. Yes, I realize it says in other places that they are soprano sized, but having it say bolded in the listing that they are CONCERT is confusing and caused me to order the wrong size.
1,I cannot fully evaluate the quality of the Cables yet since I don't know if and when they will fail, but they seem to be produced in a random shop overseas. Suffices to say that the bag I got instead of "Guitar Cable" says "Guitar Cabal".
1,don't think they'll last very long on the road
1,Tried installing these on a Gibson SG.  The screws that come with the straplock are longer and/or thicker than the standard ones on the SG.  Therefore, I did not want to force the dunlop screws into the guitar. The SG screws do not work with these because the heads are too big.  In essence, these did not work for me.
1,I purchased three of these through amazon.		When I attached one of them to my snare, it clamped on to it "ok".  But AFTER attaching my microphone (ElectroVoice PL35 drum mic) the weight of the mic was too much for the arm of the clamp, and the mic kept "falling" over ONTO the drum head.		The arm of this clamp IS NOT strong enough to support the weight of a microphone.  It is weak and flimsy.  It will not hold up.		The arm of this clamp has a wing nut that allows you to adjust its angle.  There are no "teeth" on it however, and the weight of a microphone is too much for it to support which causes the mic fall over onto your drum head.		It is a weak and "wimpy" clamp that can not support the weight of a microphone.		VERY POORLY MADE		***see my uploaded pic and notes (point your "pointer / cursor" over the 3rd and 4th pics)		I returned mine asap and got a full refund from Amazon...		Thank you Amazon!  The most professional retailer out there!  ALWAYS VERY HELPFUL!		Look elsewhere for a drum mic clip / mounting system because this one does not work.  Cheap plastic, poor design, DOES NOT function!
1,Thanks for the $225 piece of sh*t that doesn't work
1,The ebow might work fine without the huge crack in it
1,I've try bending this mount several different ways and it just seems to hang the violin by the bottom most tuning peg, though maybe that's the design. The bow holder again does its job but kind of points the bow out at am awkward angle. Since finding the sweet spot where it holds the instrument I had to close the holder so much I must turn the violin to get it in. I can hear the strings ring as it must be slightly wedged. Again it does its job but the must be a better way
1,I used these headphones in my small guitar studio for a very short time. Headphones are a useful tool for guitarists when trying to learn solos by ear. These headphones are useless for this particular application. They are mushy with little definition and they clip easily,  even when pulling out the lower frequencies and operating at a reasonable volume. I ended up giving them to my 18 year old daughter hoping that she would have better luck than I. Eventually I ended up going with the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x and I couldn't be happier.
1,CHEAPLY MADE
1,Worked great for a few hours' worth of use over the course of a month--then when I tap the playback switch, it makes a huge gnarly staticky noise that won't even turn down with volume on pedal--had to switch the amp off. Thinking it was maybe in need of a firmware update I USB'd it into my laptop--device not recognized. Such a nice looking unit flawed by, what? bad components? Poor design? Sending it back.
1,I was a bit disappointed when I received this guitar set.  The guitar itself has a very visible paint or glue drip.  Also, the description said it had an extra SET of stings, but there is only one included
1,its just ok
1,I purchased this set because I'm a beginner. Bad mistake. They are not very good quality and have dead reeds. It's difficult to learn on an instrument that doesn't work well. I contacted Hohner and they offered to fix them, if I "paid" to return them. I wasn't willing to spend more money on a poor product. The Piedmont Blues set is manufactured in China. To top it off, they taste bad. For the money, you'd be better off buying a Hohner Special 20, Key of C instead. That's what I did. The Special 20 is manufactured in Germany. The Hohner Special 20 is about the same price and works well right out of the box. I recommend buying one good harmonica instead of 7 poor quality harmonicas. You get what you pay for. Get the Special 20.	http://youtu.be/Z4irOcohieg
1,Like a few other negative reviews, I had his cable fail for no discernible reason after about a year of regular use. No damage, no excessive strain, looks perfect, but no signal. While it lasted it was quiet and sounded great and felt luxurious with that thick pvc jacket. But for $23 there are better options.
1,Idea is good but clamp does not tighten enough to feel secure.  Perhaps for a 20 dollar ukulele... but for an actual guitar that you don't want on the floor, you should pass on this!		1 star.
1,First: my hearing is just regular. I have no recording experience, but I play drums and I am a beginner in recordings, very newbie though. I don't like the sound of this card. First of all I know that if you like the way your drums sound in real life, then you should expect a 99% accurate recording of them. No major tweaks should be made. My systems: Tama Drums w/Evans and Remo heads, Vaio laptop with Ubuntu OS (linux) and with Audacity software. Just did not cut it for me. I mean, the 6$ Sabre sound card, was capturing a more accurate sound than this card from Behringer. By the way, I have a Yamaha MGc102 mixer and am happy with it, now glad I did not go with a Behringer mixer... But won't rule their mixers out forever. The card works out of the box, but the sound it seems to be processed in a "wrong way", too much bass - in may opinion. My bass drum sound is literally tweaked by the sound card in a plain, regular bass heard on most cheap songs. I KNOW my bass is a bit different since I've worked on tuning it to sound like Pantera, Metallica, and some other melodic metal. And in my room, it sounds like it, but through the Behringer... sounds as any other bass. Then the sound of toms... some of them (Evans - especially) are pure incorrect.		Now, after recording 2 times through Behringer, I tried my second purchased card:	Vantec NBA 200U		Oh man... what a difference! Drums sound exactly as in real life. Better than my USB Sabre 6 bucks card (laptop fell, broke my card). Clear sound, short, defined. I could say which tom, cymbal was hit etc. So, go with Vantec.		NOTE:	There is no output if you use Vantec on Linux (WHYYY??) What's wrong with these people not supporting Linux??	But at least you get the mic on, and it records. (or, what am I doing wrong? - yet... I know they say "Linux not supported" but still, VANTEC start supporting Linux if you want to survive! ha-ha).		Yeah, you need to reboot PC and have Pulse Audio installed, but you'll see all the digital and analog options/combinations, after reboot.		So, am still playing around. And will use the Behringer on my other PC whose sound card is "half fried" hopefully will get a good output from there, without recording, just regular use.	Cheers all, thanks for reading.
1,Complete garbage sound cuts off at full volume played a show the sound kept cutting off bad amp also tuner does not work properly can't tune a string at all ..to many gimmicks do not buy I'll buy an ampeg portaflex better tone and reliable
1,I've read other reviews on here which I found odd. I had this thing for a few weeks and I even had an extra wall adapter to sent to me free of charge. They did it without much of a hassle. I had some harsh buzzing with one of my pedals when it was connected to supply but not when I used individual wall adapters. I even had another pedal stop responding when it was powered by it and completely cut off tone, even when I turned the effect off (but it was still being powered).  It might've been the unit itself and not the power adapter, I'm not sure. I'm giving this two stars because although it didn't work, the customer service was good and  it looks pretty nice. I also have a pedal by them (the blues driver), which I do like.
1,Seat becomes loose after each set of playing.
1,After putting the strings on the guitar I noticed	that 3rd string had a different tint from other 5 strings.	Also it's thickness was nearly identical to the second string	and sound it made was somehow out of place.		Other 5 strings were in perfect condition but I ordered a set of 6	and expected to receive them all in a decent condition.	I am disappointed, thus 1 star.
1,I have been playing a Cecilio acoustic/electric violin (330) for awhile which I really like a lot.  It really sounds great through an amplifier.  I wanted to try one of these silent electric violins so that I can practice late a night.  The first one that I tried out had something wrong with the piezo pickup or with the electronics as it would most the most awful electronic static like noise when I tried to carefully bow it.  It was particularly bad with the G and the D strings.  The extremely loud electronic static was so loud that you could not hear the actual note that you were playing very well.  I tried playing it through Sennheiser and Bose headphones and also through two  different Fender Acoustasonic amplifiers.  If you barely touched the strings with the bow you might be able to make it work, but with any slight pressure on the bow that horrible noise would start up.  Also, if you touched the bow to two strings at the same time you would get the same electronic noise, even if the bow was kept motionless on the two strings.  The violin itself showed great promise, but since you have to play it through a headphone or an amplifier it was useless.  I sent this back.  It tried one more time and ordered another one in a different color to make sure they did not try to pass the same violin off on me again.  I noticed this this one appeared to be been used before as some of the varnish seemed to be missing in places.  As soon as I got it tuned up and tried playing it, the same loud electronic screech was produced again in this second violin.  On both violins I tried out three different brand new batteries in each violin to see if a possible dead battery could be overdriving the amplifier.  With each new battery the results were the same.  Another negative feature on this violin is that it does not have a 1/4" jack to connect directly to an acoustic guitar amplifier.  I have been playing electric instruments including acoustic/electric guitars, electric guitars, acoustic/electric banjos, mandolins, ukuleles, autoharps professionally for over 50 years and I have seen just about every kind of electronic problem that can occur in these instruments, but I have never seen anything as bad as this violin.  The company needs to throw out the self-contained preamp units and set these up as a passive system with a 1/4' outlet jack on them.  If I had had this unit for years, I could easily do this myself, but since it is brand new, I expect it to be working properly and thus I immediately returned the second violin also.  I am going to try to find another brand of electric violin that has a passive piezo system already built in it and use one of my external preamp equalizer units on it.  I have found that the crystals in the piezo pickups are a little fragile and can be damaged.  They piezo pickups may have a manufacturing defect in them that is not being seen by quality control when they are sold to the violin company.  Also, the sound that is being produced could be coming from the preamplifier module in the guitar as it somewhat resembles the sound  that is produced when are driving a guitar amplifier wide open on 10, but at the same time barely turning up the volume on your guitar so that the overall sound is greatly decreased.	During the early years of the 1960's those of us in the business were trying to find ways to overdrive our amplifiers without actually have to play extremely loud and deafen ourselves.  I found that using a small preamp between the guitar and the amplifier could accomplish this while keeping the overall sound volume very low.  You would turn one of these wide open and turn the other unit way down.  Later the guitar company came out with the  fuzztone unit which was the first of it's kind.	I am going go back to my wonderful Cecilio acoustic/electric violin and use my mute on it when I practice late at night.  I am not going to waste any more time on these Cecilio all electric violins until such time as they find a way to fix the problem and also install a 1/4" jack on them.
1,1 set of these... Or 3 sets of standards? Its a no brainer. dobt waste your money. They feel fine but they don't sound any better than standard strings.
1,5 months of use and the cable is having audio clipping issues now. Guitar cuts in and out. It isn't the audio jack on the guitar it's the cable. For the price I would expect it to last longer.
1,Although the power supply comes with an 8 way adaptor I can't power more than 2 pedals without creating a bunch of signal noise.  I would try something else.
1,Doesnt make sense. These were too light and needed a forth spring. These should be sold with 4 springs not 3.
1,Low quality pots, they are almost like on off switches instead of gradual volume adjustment. Only the first 1/8 turn or so actually does anything. Forget trying to adjust on the fly while playing. I gave it three stars because the price is good and it does work, I am all about getting more than you pay for but in this case I would say its about right.
1,I ordered two Ukulele's for my daughters. One was this Makala and the other the Lanikai. They both cost about the same and we wanted to have them be different to avoid any conflicts between the girls.		Amazon shipped them quickly and they were both very well packaged, as usual. Christmas morning the girls opened them up and the difference was immediately apparent. The Makala looked like a much better instrument. The Lanikai looked pretty, but it also looked pretty cheap.		The difference in tone was astounding. The Makala sounded so much warmer, sweeter and musical. The Lanikai sounded tinny and cheap. It looked like an instrument, but it didn't sound like one. The Makala was quick and easy to tune. And it held its tune from the get go. The Lanikai struggled to hold its tune generally, but on of the machined tuners simply would not hold a tune.		I contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund on the Lanikai. It is shipping back today. I ordered another Makal but with the black tuning pegs to maintain a difference for the girls. I am super pleased with the Makala. It is surprising great quality for the money. The Lanikai on the other hand was a huge disappointment. While we did have a tuner problem, the other differences in quality between the Lanikai and the Makala are truly astounding. In this price point, go with the Makala... For sure!
1,I have been using this pedal for almost exactly a year. It constantly walks away form me on a carpet. Although this is easily remedied with some rubber feet, over the course of the year the amount I've had to press the pedal to engage sustain has continuously increased. I now have to press the pedal to the floor and lean on it for sustain to engage. These things should last YEARS... not barely a year.
1,This product is not essential at all! It barely feels like its cleaning anything, and it doesnt reach all the way to the curved bottom!  I easily forget to take it out and it renders me from playing. Over all it is a big nuissense!
1,I was very disappointed in how the keyboard action feels.  It has no life or spring to it at all.  Playing it feels terrible.  To me, it's unusably bad.		Akai makes a similar sized keyboard, the LPK25 model, that feels much better to play.  It usually costs about $20 more.  But sometimes Amazon sells it for the same prices as this Korg keyboard.		I suggest you try this keyboard at a local music storing before buying it.  Otherwise, buy it from a seller who has a no questions asked return policy.  Be careful when unpacking it, to make a return easier.		Even the glass keyboard on an iPad feels better than this one.
1,Dead on arrival.
1,This product did not work well out of the box.  I shouild have gone with the Shure one for twice as much.  There was a lot of noise from the volume knob.  It was very difficult to get to the proper level.  It ruined the recording of a show I recorded.  I don't use it any more.  Cheap plastic components.  Not professional at all.
1,These had the potential to be my favorite pair of sticks. They have great balance and the grip recess is a marvel of control.  Unfortunately, they used an inferior grade of wood and the tips began to chip after only a few plays. Regarding the comments about the rubber creating blisters, that is only a problem if you grip these very tightly.  Back off a little and let them float and they just hang in perfectly. They also have a problem with the painted tips leaving marks all over your heads and cymbals.  They became completely unusable due to the broken tips.  They should leave the tips unpainted with a neutral treatment and use a different wood.  I would be happy to try an improved model maybe with nylon tips?
1,one year four months in it is dead....  just out of warranty.  disappointed.  planet waves cables come with a lifetime warranty but apparently not this.
1,I had it for 3 days and played it for 5 hours tops and it already developed a long crack.  I'm trying to return it now.  This is not cured, sealed and fire treated bamboo.  This will crack eventually.  You are better off avoiding bamboo and going with a real wooden Didge.  Bamboo is not a good wood for a Didge.  I'm very disappointed.  I could have it replaced but what's the use.  Bamboo will crack!  And I took real good care of it.
1,CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again
1,A good idea that falls short in its usefulness.  The tuner portion works fine, and it sits discretely on the sound hole rim.  But, if you sometimes play or strum close to the sound hole this unit will dislodge very easily and fall into your guitar.  Had they made this tuner to fit tighter, it might then mar your guitar top; therefore, there seems to be no real remedy for this type of tuner.
1,This does not sound good and there is no battery compartment. Wish I never bought this.
1,I can't believe all the positive reviews on these strings. They start out sounding bad and rapidly get worse. Sticking to Preludes from now on.
1,I own and use a Blue Snowball for all my audio needs, and recently I wanted a better boom mic stand then the one I currently own. As any owner of a Blue Snowball knows, the microphone is a tad bit on the heavy side; even more so with the ringer. So I searched around until I found this one, which had answers to questions in regards to the Blue Snowball. Saying that the microphone can easy connect, and it will have no trouble holding the mic. The first answer was correct, but the second was very wrong. This stand could not withstand the weight of the Blue Snowball, immediately dropping the Snowball when it was finally attached. When I attempted to tighten the single tensioner on the elbow of the stand, it snapped like the cheap piece of plastic it was. Ridiculous! Now I'm unsure what this stand will be like for a lighter microphones, but specifically for the Blue Snowball it did not work.
1,Brand new to keyboards and ordered this stand at the same time I ordered the keyboard.(88 key Alesis Recital).  The keyboard does not fit well on the top, it is not as stable as I would have liked.  Because of the 'X' design I have difficulty getting the keyboard close to me without hitting the support structure with my knees.  The adjustments are Pin-in-Hole style and not all the holes are big enough to allow easy passage of the adjustment pin.	Am honestly thinking of moving this stand to the garage, putting a piece of lumber on it and use it for a work surface there.
1,I bought this for a friend of mine along with a Boss DS-1 Distortion Guitar Pedal.  During our first time playing together, he had to switch to running the pedal on battery because using this power supply caused a significant amount of hum.  We tried reversing it in the socket hoping that was the problem and lifting the round on the pedal, but it still hummed.  Not sure what to do about it now.
1,Noise and noise.  I love to build cable myself and I strongly believe in my soldering skills as well.  The first cable that I've made, I've plugged in my Presonus 24 Mixer along with my Sennheiser E835, Sennheiser wireless D1, everything was quiet as it should be, I was happy. Then I started to build more and more cables with difference / customized length.  As soon as I plugged the cable I just made into my Presonus Mixer and GTD Audio G787L UHF, I started to hear the noise.  I was in doubt and thought about I might do the wiring wrong, I then verified with the previous cables I made, they are all identical.  I then pulled out my trusty Monoprice XLR bulky and heavy cable, plugged in between my GTD Audio G787L UHF and the mixer, things were super quiet again, swapped out with this cables, the noise started to hear from my Yamaha.  Plugged in with my Sennheiser E835, my Sennheiser D1 wireless mic with this GLS cable I made, it's quiet. Since the combination has not changed, only the cable, therefore this cable is no longer in my shopping list, or at least, if you think about the combination of GTD Auio and GLS Audio Cables, think again ...!
1,I received the pedal and I was very excited, I have an Alesis PercPad drum pads, and I needed a good kick pedal (I was using a piano sustain pedal), I bought this Yamaha because of its price. I tried with my Alesis in the Switch mode and nothing, I changed the mode to Trigger and nothing!! I tried it in a keyboard and got nothing, just didn't work at all!! I bought it was when I was on vacations and Amazon sent it to the adress I gave, so Amazon said that they couldn't send me a new one where I live and I couldn't return the bad one, so Amazon was amazing in giving me money back and I kept the bad pedal. Amazon service is incredible!!	I opened the pedal and fixed it, it took me a while, it was a bad contact, still I have to press the pedal really hard so I can get a sound from my Alesis unit. So, I always recommend Amazon but I don't recommend this pedal, first didn't work, and then I had to fix it myself, and still doesn't work entirely well.
1,Way overpriced for what it delivers. I'm a little surprised that Gilmour let them put his name on this package. Definitely would not buy any of these preloaded pickguards again, no matter who's name they put on it!
1,Very poor product, I had to return it. My mic's quality and volume diminished when using this adapter. Take it out of the market until it is fixed. I won't but from this company again.
1,I would not buy this cable again.  It is very noisy.  I have purchase other quality items from Mediabridge (their banana clips are excellent); however, a good guitar cable should not have noise, but with this one, if you move the cable around or touch any part of it with another, you hear it through the amplifier.  I typically don't write negative reviews, but I just want to steer people away from a product that doesn't do it's job.
1,Terrible pegs! Pay more and get more.
1,sent me a blank piece of wood.
1,It has it's place occasionally, but it sounds more like Santa Claus coming to town with a small plastic tamborine, which is exactly what it is.
1,You get what you pay for. Based on user reviews, I knew I was rolling the dice with this purchase. It's an inexpensive product, so cheap manufacturing is expected.		Some work. Mine didn't.
1,Mine did not come in its original packaging as one of the pictures suggested. When I plugged it into my Mac Pro running OS X it's recognized.		I wanted to use this with my midi capable guitar through a Roland GR-20 into GarageBand. GarageBand seems to recognize that something was plugged in but I couldn't get a signal from the GR-20. Oh well, at least it didn't cost a lot to do this experiment.		I haven't tried using this cable from a normal keyboard.
1,I wish I could give it no stars at all. This is a toy, not a musical instrument. Piece of crap. Goes out of tune with one strum. Don't waste your money.
1,Just wasted time and money on these. Not for leather straps, maybe cheep cloth straps. Not for good guitar staps
1,I have gotten other value stands but this is the thinnest and most wobbly stand ever. Its good for say a splash, it sways all over the place with a 16 inch crash. Even with the base spread out as much as possible.
1,For some reason every Fender Pickup Mounting screw I've ever used ends up stripped. This are no exception. Good thing this package had 12 and I only used 4 to change my pickups from a P-Bass. Well I used 6 since 2 of them where severy damaged, the other 4 where somewhat damaged. I tried different screwdrivers but the result is always the same. Good thing once the pickup is set where you like it you barely move it, I can't imagine having to make adjustments every now and then with this quality.
1,Apogee makes great products but this one isn't much better than the original Duet. You can't beat the firewire connection and it is much more solidly built. I had to return it.
1,Mic clip is not universal and the Nady that comes with it is terrible		However the stand itself is pretty sturdy but if you are planning on using any other mic you will need a mic clip and its not really the standard type (universal clips will NOT fit on it)
1,Counterfeit! purchased through 8th street music-lower case.
1,It's kinda poopy actually if you are trying to play bass lines with a guitar. Probably fine if you want your fast solos where you wiggle notes for no reason to sound different than when you did that in every other song.
1,My problem is that I am used to playing Hohner Golden Melody and Special 20 harps.  I guess I should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings.  These harps have no volume.  Don't waste your money on them.  I guess the only thing worth having is the case, but the case has no handles or carry strap.		5/25/14 - I said the case had no handle, well I take that back.  There is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat.  I was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it.  With one finger I can carry the case with my quality harps inside.
1,Love the color and portability.  However, with very light usage support braces already broke.
1,Perhaps I'd received a defective set. The G string snapped and unraveled at the tuning peg as I was stringing my guitar at less than full tension. When I removed it, I saw the entire string was easily bent and brittle. The lower wound strings were tarnished right out of the packaging. I liked the sound in the demo video, but won't order another set. Amazon did provide a completely hassle-free refund, so I am not reluctant to buy other strings from them.
1,Very cheaply made,and not worth the money at all. It was extremely noisy,and after trying to make it work better,and without success,I returned it,and went to the Behringer PB600. It was a little more money,but well worth it. I had no problems with the return.
1,It works but not good quality at all and iphone is terrible for recording. The app tascam makes is horrible and crashes, use garageband instead.
1,Looks cool.. but awkward it is upside down compared to the jim dunlop which I find much easier to use
1,Returned. After looking closely at the soldering connections I decided to go with a new higher end tube.
1,Just got my set delivered. They look great but are pretty much useless. The Allen Bolt that is supposed to tighten them on is useless. Tightened it all the way and you could pull them right off as if it wasn't tightened at all. Waste of money.
1,It isn't a great speaker. It has some noise. It is also so small that the sound is pretty directional and unpleasant. Considering the price it is not worth it. For a little bit more money you can get a 1x12" that will be much better. Very let down by this speaker. Also has only one input and no output so can't use it in combination with another cabinet.
1,I ordered two of these, one as a gift and one for me. The giftee hated it and mine was defective. I returned them. This product got good reviews so I may have just been unlucky. The giftee was vague about why he hated it.
1,Often, we get what we pay for. After researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks, I chose solid items for reasonable prices.		I should've known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle - the quality of the cable. This item simply didn't ever work - it arrived with a bent pen on one end, and even when we attempted to straighten it, it didn't connect well onto the mixer board. The microphone end was a VERY shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic.		Don't buy this item - spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand.
1,Worked great for one year then every once and awhile you will lose a speaker, you have to unplug the system count to 10 then plug it in. This sucks of course when you in the middle of an event. It is a good size and had decent volume while it worked. The is the second one I had because the first one broke within the first month. Amazon was great and replaced the first one with no issues;
1,Was pretty fast shipping but the strings make a strange sound. When you play you can hear an extra sound that shouldn't be there.
1,Ugly and cheap looking in real life.
1,This seat wasn't comfortable at all.  It literally hurt my back.  The metal stand shed some greasy silver gunk.		I haven't returned anything in the years of buying tons of items from amazon unless they were broken.		This was the first simply because of how cruddy the product was.
1,Did not work and took awhile to get a refund. Hinders some usb devices from working.
1,This may be considered user error, but I bought it to record my nylon string guitar. I have an AT 2005 USB mic, that sounds kinda lame, so I thought I would try this mic. Big mistake, it makes the AT sound like a studio quality mic by comparison. I fear that I am expecting too much.....
1,This sounds bit smaller than expected for this price
1,Jury's out on this thing . My guitar teacher thinks it's useless.
1,Had I known what I was getting I would never have ordered it.  There are gig bags and there are gig bags.  I've ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags.  I expected more. This one offers almost no protection.  The only reason I have not returned it yet is that the return shipping will leave little to refund, but may end up returning it anyway.		It *did* fit my Kala KA-TG with room to spare.
1,I ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it "New," and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new, I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller.
1,I agree with the other reviews here that there is a problem with the wheels.  They are too small and too close together.  As a result, the bag tends to tip over when you wheel it--even when you wheel it straight ahead.  It's really bad on turns.  Apparently, it never occurred to the people at Pro Tec to actually put some drums in the bag and wheel it around to see if the design works.  It doesn't and they should fix it.  The overall construction seems fine, although it certainly is not super sturdy.  But the design of the wheels is just plain stupid.
1,If I could give these tuners ZERO stars I would. These deserve a minus rating category. Poor workmanship, binding, and a 12:1 ratio render these basically unusable to anyone seeking to have their guitar play in tune.		Tune a string which is 2 cents flat (on a Peterson strobe) and move the tuning key the slightest and now you have 2 cents sharp. Just starting to put pressure on the key and you can see it change pitch. This is most likely due to the crummy machine work on the gears which cause them to bind. Honestly, these are the absolute worst tuners I have EVER used. It isn't a fluke as I have two sets, one brushed or satin chrome and one gold.		Contacting Sperzel gets a," send them back to be repaired." They are new! When asking about buying another set, I asked if they were as bad, could I send them back for a refund. Their reply,"No!" They stated I could only return them for replacement or repair as well.		A 12:1 ratio, in my opinion, isn't a good ratio. The replacement tuners I ordered from Hipshot are 18:1, meaning you can fine tune your guitar. Steer clear of Sperzel, they honestly don't seem to care. How anyone can say anything positive about these, or rate them 5 stars, is beyond me. Total junk. They used to be great from what I have heard but something happened and whatever it is, it isn't good.
1,I have a 19 year old Wah pedal, I have a 23 year old Fuzz Face and a 10 year old Fultone 2 OD and Boost. I have a near 13 month old Joyo Analog Delay. It just stopped working at the start of a show! Too bad because I really liked it. I was very embarrassed. I had to replace it fast, my guitar guy fixed me up with a new Boss. He always had a few bad words for the Chinese made Joyo pedals. Now I know why and now he has a story to tell.
1,PEOPLE- it's just a microphone (x2). It does nothing that any other crappy microphone sitting there all by itself will do... It just happens to be wireless; hence a receiver with a cable running out of it rather than a microphone with a cable running out of it! It needs to be plugged into a mixer and amplifier system or recording device just like any other mic; hence you do not see he word amplifier or speaker listed as part of the item. So why is this question being asked 20 million times-lol? And truly at this price expect a toy that will break soon. If you want anything approaching decent sound you need to spend a lot more. And even then wireless systems can be temperamental. This is the kind of unit for the kids to have fun with if your home stereo has a 1/4" microphone input or you have a Karaoke Machine. BTW, two mics sharing a single channel like this could be problematic; you can expect frequency cancellations (drop outs)that will probably come and go as you move around the room causing frustration. Just use one mic and save the other for WHEN the first mic breaks.
1,Not that great.  Not very bright or full sounding.  "Normal" tension of this brand is a tad better in terms of how they feel to play but that may just be my personal taste and not the strings.  There is nothing special about these at all.  They take a long time to stretch enough that you have any tuning stability, more than Augustine or Savarez strings.  I would use these if I had no other option but otherwise I won't buy them again.
1,Lately, all I have been buying are DAVA picks, but not this crap.  What I thought would be a good idea turns out to be a miscarriage.	Let me tell you that I used to tend to throw half a dozen picks across the stage/room about every night I play.  Even Gorilla Snot didn't keep the darn things from going airborne.	Don't get me wrong, DAVA makes some other picks I really like.  The one I use most is the red(delrin)-tipped, black model 1303 pick.  But I cannot use these stupid "grip" picks for an entire night without the soft rubber coming loose from the hard plastic and turning the thing to junk.  The problem is, the soft rubber is needed in the center area of the pick, where the center of your grip is.  All that soft garbage around the edges is useless, unless it is for DAVA to sell a damn lot more of them than necessary.  The soft crap tears away from the hard plastic and then the whole thing comes apart.
1,Mine would work for a moment and then stop.. maybe I just got a bad one? I had to return it.
1,DEFINITELY does NOT fit a Martin Orchestra size (OOO, or OM) model sound hole which is 3 7/8". Wood made cracking noises trying to get it in pushing in the sides of the rubber with a plastic tool. Yikes!!! The product may work great - couldn't tell you. It also would not fit in my Epiphone DR-212 Dreadnaught. Both common size guitars. Just too big. Obviously so when you look at it.
1,I would love to give this product a better review as it is very good-looking and functional, but mine came with a very obvious and irritating defect.  Right out of the box it had a cut or rip across both zippers on one side, meaning the zipper won't pull past that point.  Should have never been shipped  Another product that I should have returned right away...actually I might still be in the window to return.  Also, it is overpriced. Should be $20 cheaper, but I ordered it anyway because I liked the Line 6 logo case for carrying my POD HD500X.  Too bad about the defect - otherwise it'd be 4 stars.
1,I tried this on a live gig from a buddy who raved about this pedal. Its has a great distortion and sustain, but its got a compressor circuit and you cant adjust it or turn it off, when I tried to pound a high note the attack and volume gets squashed/neutered. I know funk bassists and studio cats dig a good compressor but I absolutely cant stand one on my live rig(I expect and count on a GOOD soundman to add it in a live mix, great, as long as I cant hear it). Kinda pricey too, I ended giving this pedal back to my buddy, no thanks. I ended up buying the comparable MXR dist/D.I. that has a mid control and noise gate @ about a third less than what this pedal costs. IMHO a much better deal; more for less and no compress(ion).
1,There's always a first time and this happens to be "it". Tested before mounting for ohm stature. CLEARLY nowhere near the 5.6k advertised. How about 6.7/ 6.9/ 6.4 on two separate meters. I thought, ok, let's see how they sound. Installed...anticipating clack and cluck classic Fender Stratocaster sounds........one dead from the between 100 mV rms to over 1 V rms throughput and the solder failed. Took it to authorized Fender repair shop that's known world wide but in my hometown and a friend.....soldered it...short story long....the Squier pickups in the guitar I was hot rodding for my son, sounded infinitesimally better !! Sent them back, looking elsewhere , I've had a 1963 Stratocaster, '78'  '82  '96..2012, now two 2014's. At 65 yrs old I know what good sounds like, and those aren't it.
1,it came used its not the best i wouldn't recommend it because a lot of times the when i plug it in the power cable comes out on the laser... the Mic is busted up and the fan makes this weird noise.. also the stand wouldn't screw on and the you really can't hag it on trussing..and the box looked like a truck ran over it and there was no padding keeping the laser safe so i wouldn't recommend
1,I ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated. However, the bag was ripped in 3 places. The stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing. The most annoying thing was that they did not match each other. The locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights. The holes in the inner poles were drilled  in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height. They looked like they might be relatively solid but I returned them anyway...bit disappointing.
1,The wraps are high quality.  I will give them that.  But, their main drawback is obvious - they are so wide that it obscures playing notes at the first fret.  I play with a Floyd Rose so the wrap has to begin below the nut.  And, it isn't the best solution anyway as it wraps around the strings and it is difficult to get it tight enough on all 6 strings simultaneously.  A better solution is the insert a piece of cloth between the strings and the fretboard rather than wrapping around the strings.  For this, microfiber cable ties&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MARKLIFE-30PCS-Self-Attaching-Reusable-Colourful-Cable-Tie-Organizer-Wire-Cord-Fastening-Wraps-Microfiber-Cloth-Adjustable-Multipurpose-Hook-and-Loop-Securing-Straps-for-Cord-Management-5-Color-7/dp/B01N9IGPHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MARKLIFE 30PCS Self Attaching Reusable Colourful Cable Tie Organizer Wire,Cord Fastening Wraps, Microfiber Cloth,Adjustable  Multipurpose Hook and Loop Securing Straps for Cord Management,5 Color,7</a>&nbsp;are much cheaper and more effective and can be pulled out/inserted easily enough.  The cable ties can also be cut narrower than .5 inch.  Cutting the Fretwrap to make it narrower would be disastrous/impossible.  Although, it looks great, this product is gimmicky and not the best solution in my opinion.
1,Not very good design for it was meant to do. Does not relieve stress from the weight of the instrument. Not comfortable at all.
1,Great idea but very poor tuner. It doesn't work properly. You have to touch the tuner directly to your guitar to make it work.
1,Tried these, but the low A broke within 45 minutes of practice playing on my 12 string acoustic just after re-string. It snapped over the saddle, something that I've never had for a low wirewound string. I've had the high G break near end of life, but never had a string go out when brand new. Compared to D'Addario Extra Lights I normally use, they are heavier gauge, the sound is bright and quite metallic, maybe a bit more body to the sound than the D'Addario's, and not bad in my opinion. But they are coming straight back off. Can't afford to risk a string going at the next gig. Back to the D'Addario strings for me.
1,Added too much color for my liking. EQ knob is simply a tone control. Might be good for for guitar with an amp or acoustic guitar, but for bass DI into the FOH desk it just didn't cut it. I can't return it because I did use it for a while trying to get the best sound. I ultimately will sell it used as I have replaced it with an MXR compressor.		Not a bad pedal, but if you need a very clean compressor, step up to the MXR, Boss, or similar. More money, for sure, but much more versatile and transparent.
1,I bought the Tele version from Saga. The G- and B-string tuner holes in the headstock were drilled too close together, making it impossible to fit the G tuner to the headstock and making it impossible to tune the G string accurately. Also, one wire was too short, so I had to supply my own. The distributor wouldn't correct the problem, told me to contact Saga. Saga never responded. The guitar is useless (wasting not only the money for the purchase but the cost of the paint, hours invested, etc). You don't want this product!
1,I ordered this for my daughter as a back up. we finally opened it to get it ready and started tightening , the end part broke!
1,I kept these on for about a week and switched to dunlop heavy core. They don't handle down tuning very well and they have a odd metal (not the music style) sound to them.
1,This is a good alternative to the POG if you're on a budget. The output is really good if you run in through a clean channel. After about a week the unit became hot then stopped working
1,Good for maybe a 70's party or something in the garage. Not a professional light device.
1,I still get quite a bit of pop. Not impressed.
1,Kinda a waste of money. Clean lint free rag will do the same job.
1,Theses are good tuners but my battery (hoping battery) arrived DOA. I will have to get out there and buy one.
1,Not level at all!	Beware!
1,The clean channel is absolutely horrendous... I think my phone has better quality sound and it is louder.. This would be ideal for a young kid just starting out.  However if you appreciate good sound don't waste your money.
1,I bought D'Addaria and Gibson. No comparison. Despite Martin being so cheap in price and quality, it's no wonder that D'Addario is eating their lunch. Given the choice low cheap Gibson guitars and high end American made guitars, Gibson looks like a has been in the making.
1,Does not work on battery. Works great otherwise, but want to lose the added power converter and cord.
1,Stopped working in 4 months time with light to normal use.  I looked up the M-Audio Customer service number and stayed on hold for 45 mins with no response.  There are no manuals or warranty information online.
1,Didn't really care for them. Won't stay on thumb.
1,I'm either going to return this or sell it. I bought it for my five string, installed it as directed and found that it mutes the tone of my higher register a bit and makes it sound tinny when I'm playing acoustically with the pick up attached.
1,Case was marked open box good condition. But center latch with key was damaged wheh I took it out of box. Should have been noted the damage. Fits fender strat billet tightly. Not much internal storage but looks like a sturdy case.
1,This thing is all sharp edges and cheap feel, and the "rubber" piece is more like plastic. Combine that with the overly-flat radius, and it's kind of a pain to make it work well. I'll stick with Shubb and Keyser.
1,I might be the lucky one who received a bad oddball. Unfortunately, I stopped considering Behringers all together after I experience this one.	The speakers behaved drastically differently from the specification on the manual. This monitor did *not* give the advertised near-flat frequency responses. It had weird resonance in the case. High frequency was muddled. Lower range was over-amplified. It totally beats the purpose of monitor speakers.	Naively, I believed that Behringer was lower-priced because it did not yet establish its brand name. It was not a good deal. It was waste of money.		I am actually writing this review few years after hoping to help other shoppers. I should have purchased a Mackie, which I guess is considered a different class for good reasons.		By the way, even my PC speaker (Harman Kardon) gave better responses than this.
1,Elixir Polywebs are not for most guitars, but in some cases they can help improve overly bright, harsh sounding guitars that need to be mellowed down a bit. Other than that I didn't like them at all on my guitars. So much for the Polywebs. However, the Nanoweb 80/20s are a whole different story. My all time favorite guitar strings are the Elixir 80/20 Nanowebs --it takes them a little while to break in, but once they do, they just get better and better... and they last a long, long time.
1,Has almost no sustain and easily gets snagged when switching strings.		I found a similar sized piece of copper tubing in my basement that works way better (though it doesn't fit as snugly).		It's a shame because I like the basic design and I was really excited to integrate this into my playing.		Needs to have the edges rethought, needs more mass for more sustain.  Make a better one and send it to me and I'll change my review :)
1,If you need to get ride of the guide nipple on these, just clip them, don't need to file them down, they're plastic not metal.  Other than that; they do guide the strings. However plastic fluctuates and wears down after time with strings sliding back and forth from tunings, metal doesn't wish they were metal.
1,I'd never heard of the product and my initial reaction was could the O-Port be a contemporary take on the Loar-era Virzi tone enhancer/producer/reducer (depending on whom you ask and the instrument in question)?		The Virzi was actually a suspended plate that didn't sit in the sound hole like the O-Port. It was also used on F-style mandolins and violins that didn't have round sound holes - but the idea of altering the vibrations in the sound chamber to affect tone is similar.		Despite the box's declaration `Easy to Install' and `Requires no modification to the instrument', be careful with this thing and any guitar you value the finish of.  The O-Port can be installed and removed with strings attached, but it's definitely easier and safer if you loosen and/or remove them first.		The large size fit the sound hole on my trusty '77 Takamine `lawsuit era' F-360S (a D-28 clone), but was too large for my Tak C-132S classical (a pretty standard-sized nylon string).  It came close to fitting my '96 Martin OM-1, but it wasn't close enough to risk scuffing up the finish.		The O-Port is made of malleable plastic that won't easily crease and deform (a good thing). The idea is to squash it sideways `like a hat' and insert it with the wide rim down. The tricky part is then reaching in and lifting while bending the upper rim and positioning the lip just above and outside the sound hole.		Soft as the plastic is, I believe it will easily mar a delicate finish if pressed and/or slid along the sound hole edge. Perhaps one solution is to use low-tack masking tape, paper towel, or tissue paper to protect the rim area while pulling and positioning the O-Port then removing it before pressing the lip down into place.		There's roughly 2" of the upper rim with no lip that should be positioned towards the pick guard or where your pick stroke is likely to exit the sound hole area. The O-Port fits snugly - but not overly tight - which is good when the time comes to remove it, as well as reassuring it's probably not influencing top plate stresses and vibrations.		Unfortunately the main problem I have with the O-Port is the sound enhancement is barely noticeable and what (I think) is there is not the kind of change I want for playing or recording this particular instrument. I use this dreadnaught-sized guitar mostly for flatpicking and I'm more concerned with high-end and mid-range clarity than bottom - if anything, dreadnaughts tend to be bottom-heavy by design, so any additional emphasis down there amounts to a negative in my book.		According to the frequency chart on the box, the effect is meant to be a wider, though not necessarily longer, sustaining tail. This is a very much played, seasoned instrument with a nice tight response and I just didn't hear any pronounced richness in the trailing notes. Worst of all what I did hear sounds like high-end loss at the expense of more bottom.		I realize tone perception is by nature subjective because everyone's hearing is as well. One person's `richer and louder' is another's `boomier and less crisp'. But at the end of the day I didn't get anything resembling a `Wow factor' tone wise using the O-Port on this guitar. I regret not being able to try it on the smaller-bodied OM-1 because that's a guitar I wouldn't mind some extra bottom on, even at the expense of high-end.		The 360-S doesn't have on-board electronics so I can't evaluate that specific kind of feedback suppression using the O-Port.  But for testing purposes I tried something I haven't done in years: point a condenser mic at a steel string guitar sound hole going into a guitar amp, simulating a PA that in the past would easily trigger feedback. As expected I got the feedback but I could not detect a noticeable threshold difference with or without the O-Port installed.		When recording acoustic guitars with external mics I work at lower volumes and only get feedback if I accidentally leave my monitor speakers on, so the O-Port has no value for me in that setting.		Bottom Line: If the O-Port is in fact a new take on the Virzi, I'm sorry to say I think history will hand down a similar verdict many players of the day did who paid repairmen to `get this thing out of my axe'.
1,Could not run on three diffent PC's "USB overload" spend a little more and buy a better one.  Too cheap to ship back for a replacement.  I don't see the the replacement being any better.
1,As a capo its just fine. Does the job. As a tuner, garbage. There are better options. I tried on multiple guitars with this and my boss tuner pedal. Not even close. I trust my boss pedal more than this. Buy a capo and a tuner.
1,Ive been playing guitar & bass for over 25 years & I also like to D.J. I bought this with intentions to use it bridged to drive a Dayton 15" sub. I never made it there. Testing it I'm running it -2-chanels. side-1 to a pair of full range (5.25" bookshelf speakers)total 4ohm load. & the other channel crossed over to a JBL 10" sub. Both are run through a compressor / limiter. I cant believe how weak this amp is! I can actually push it to start CLIPPING before the cheap 5.25" speakers give out . I also have a CARVIN 1000 watt poweramp that I play bass through & believe me that the PYLE is just a pile. The carvin will push a Eminence 15 with -1- channel & push it to it's max. The voice coil will start to smell & thsts when I turn it down. The Pyle is clipping with no problem & a true 1000 watt amp would melt those 5" speakers within seconds. Save the money & spend it on a quality poweramp About $300 will get you in the REAL 1000watt range.
1,heh they suck
1,Bulky and not very flexible in use. Takes a lot of table space that is hard to come by for most musicians.
1,There ok, very stiff. I thought they would be a little softer and more flexible.	I made some of my own from a felt placemat, I made them bigger and from a softer felt. I like mine better. They produce a softer sound on my guitar. I don't have a ukelleli.
1,Like dragging ur hands across sand paper and the paint don't stay for long on the g b and high e strings
1,Returned, loud and grindy noises. Box had been opened.
1,Not welt built at all, though it does work. The tip on mine kept falling off or getting stuck in my mic cable. If I had only planned on using it for stationary mic then it may have been sufficient.
1,Cable failed and stop working after 2 months of normal use. No hitches were done and no one stood on it. Internal terminal connections look fine, so it must be something that is not exposed to simple sight. I regret buying this thing. The cable looks bad quality and cheaply made right out of the box, so, don't be misled by all these good reviews like I did.
1,I already had tried these heads and knew I hated their sound and feel. I got a great deal on mine "used" to cut-out to make lug gaskets.
1,Same sounds as the pod 2.0, but it sucks because it doesn't have knobs for every function, and the output is 3.5 mm instead of quarter inch. The quarter inch out is only going for a guitar amp and sucks if you use that for D.I. This is a crappy product. Get a pod 2.0, xt, or hd and skip this one.
1,It's definitely a cheaply made cable. It works, but both of the ends I've noticed are very touchy and fragile. So maybe consider a better quality cable if you're looking for long term use.
1,I have to change these on a regular basis on my fender HRD 410 III		They break.	Don't even get me started on Fender putting a plastic handle on a HRD 410... It is a known issue with all their big amps that have a single handle - they break.
1,Broke after one weeks use. I use the bottom part for a big paper clip now.
1,The idea is great, but it does not work. Difficult to position, won't stand ware and tear of normal use.. Don't waste your money.
1,Way too small. Not a good value. Buy a small pillow and some Velcro instead.
1,The Hipshot A style brass bridge is my favorite bass bridge so I got the Hipshot KickAss (black one) just to try it on my Jazz bass and it came unfinished. For the price that you pay and the Hipshot name you would think that their quality control would be better. Did the people at Hipshot expect the customer to actually finish the piece? I might as well get a Chinese version which will probably come with a good finish but cost me a fraction of the money. I think this is definitely an embarrassment to the company. But I thought I would give this bridge a second chance just to be fair. Maybe this was a single bad bridge that got through the line. Well, I have to say that it was a good thing that I reordered the bridge because this second bridge was just beautiful. Finally I got a good one and not one that should have been a reject.	It was well made and heavy with lots of mass. The feel of the bridge is very high end and you get good sustain. The sound is very clear with pronounced notes. It feels very good when you play the strings. It certainly gives your bass a high end feel. This second one I got has the chrome finish. I am very happy with this one, at last.  I would recommend this specific one that I got the second time to anyone looking for an excellent bass bridge for their Jazz bass or Precision bass. If only they had competent people working in their finishing department, I would say the same thing about all of them.	UPDATE:	Since the above purchase I have bought two more of these (including a five string version) for some of my Fender basses. These bass bridges have turned out to be some of the best bridges I have used. But I have had to return a couple of them because of lower quality finishes which has been very frustrating..	As far as design is concerned, Hipshot has come up with a winner with these. It's like the Leo Quan Badass bridge but on steroids. Excellent feel, sound and sustain.	Sadly I feel I would be doing the customers on Amazon an injustice if I gave this bridge a five star rating	I have returned three of these so far. I have purchased three of these. That's a 50/50 chance that you have on getting a good one. This shows that their quality control is not doing their job.	Do yourself a favor and get the Leo Quan bad ass bridge or the Omega bass bridge which is a copy of the Bad ass bridge. That's what I will do in the future.
1,You get what you pay for. Spend $20 or $25. The hair sucks on this thing. The curve is also uneven. It's brazilwood so it is light and flexes well but it has too many drawbacks to recommend. AVOID THIS BOW.
1,I have Pearl drums and I needed to buy longer nuts and bolts to fit the dampers to the shells
1,Looks cool.. but awkward it is upside down compared to the jim dunlop which I find much easier to use
1,This capo looks amazing, but it does not hold well. You cannot get the pressure of a Shubb or other similar capos. Consequently the sound it produces is not as clean. As has been said, this also contributes to other problems. The guitar does not stay in tune while using this capo and bending strings, or during hard strumming. It is also more expensive. I would send it back if it were worth my time. I would not recommend this capo or buy it again.
1,I know there are a lot of positive reviews on this stand, but I am not a fan!  Just to qualify my review, I am a frequently gigging musician in a band, not as a solo acoustic artist.		I find the center pole becomes unstable if you need to extend the stand. As you get close to the end of each vertical section, the section will start to wobble within the stand no matter how you much you tighten the stops. If you can use it with each section extended no more than 50%, then it is much more stable. I don't think this would be a problem if you sit to play and can place the mic stand directly in front of you.		The tripod width-adjusting legs at the base are easily pulled completely out of the stand. It's a pain to fit them back in, especially if your setup it running later than you'd like. Also, getting each at the exact same length, to help make the stand not lean from perpendicular, is difficult. It would be MUCH better to have a 'click-stop' system, or at least length markings (which I scribed into mine) rather than having to eye-ball the extensions for equivalent lengths.		One other problem I have had is when I use the boom extended and also put the AirTurn Manos iPad holder on the same side of the stand. Unless you are careful how you position the tripod base legs, the stand will tip from the weight. I use an Audix OM2 mic, which weights only about as much as a Shure SM57, and a standard 10" iPad.		The stand and boom are very light and does pack into a very small space when transporting, but I have gone back to a solid Ultimate Support mic stand in all cases except very cramped stages and ONLY when I know nothing will bump into the stand. I do sometimes use just the stand attached directly to the Manos (ie. not with the side-arm support) and it works great. But I would not recommend this stand for holding a mic with an extended boom, especially when the stand has to be vertically extended past 4 ft, or if you need the boom extended and also attach an iPad to the stand.
1,it kills my tone since i clicked it. i turn reverb always on when play that's just not for me
1,OK, it does work but a little too sticky for me, will say it hangs in there for hours.  Like cutting down a pine tree and running fingers through the sap in the cross section.  I prefer the Zildjian stick wax.  I don't mind the pine but the wax is a better smell.
1,Installed it and it doesnt work at all. Im so bummed out.guess ill have to buy a new pedal. Disappointing......
1,They hardly light up. Either batteries are dead or they are just terrible. They need to test them before they send them out.  I'm sending them back.
1,When I pay $14 for a set of strings, I expect them to be way better that a $6 set.  Sadly, ELIXER is falling down in their quality control.  This most recent set of strings I bought sounded like a 6 month old set of six dollar strings as soon as I put them on the guitar.  I'm willing to pay the extra for strings that sound bell-clear AND stay that way for at least a month or two afterwards.  This is the second set of bad strings I've gotten from ELIXER.  I bought a set of "POLYWEB" strings, thinking they'd be better.  They were "dead-on-arrival" as well.  Maybe that's the intention - a 'duller' sound?  I don't know.  But "NANOWEB" have always been bell-clear and bright.  Not this time.  Let's see if I actually get a refund or credit.  Otherwise, I'm done with ELIXER.  I certainly cannot return them now that they've been put on the guitar and trimmed.
1,I bought this interface because it was USB 2.0 compatible, had MIDI interfaces, and 4 mic inputs with 48V phantom for all. I am an electrical engineer. Right from the start I felt like I was an engineer testing this and sending it back for a re-design. This thing never works the same way twice. I always have to spend a half day to set this up. I used a dual-core Intel notebook with 4BG Ram with Sonar X DAW. I had the same problems when  using Avid's ProTools LE. The quality of the sound was CD quality at best and I could never get the 96kHZ 24 bit mode working. And if you want to monitor the recording with effects, I have only been able to do it with their bundled software. The latency on three different DAWs was too great to be useful You'd think they would have tested this on all of the popular DAWs. Stay away from this one.
1,It doesnt put enough pressure
1,horrible sounds, two speakers do not blend the bass comes from one the treble from the other so your melody and rhythm sound off - cheap crud - don't do it not even for a foster kid you hate
1,Not a very good power supply
1,First all I hate gig bags hate em I bought one of these cases for a little Martin 3 years ago I liked it worked well got another one for another little Martin the other day took 3 weeks to get here an it was terrible the latches feel like if you open it a dozen times that will be it they'll break for sure 80 bucks is a lot for this case I got a regular full size case for 30 bucks off Craigslist an put a towel in it works great if you get one I hope it's better than what I got JUNK it's going back good luck
1,I thought these picks would be interesting to try out, but the raised portion is way too thick, and I did not get a very good strumming experience from using them.  Can't recommend them.
1,These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:	1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!	2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.	3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.	For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.
1,Returned. After looking closely at the soldering connections I decided to go with a new higher end tube.
1,Bought two of these from Amazon.com First one returned, second one same problem with Loud BUZZ through the Amp. Other effects pedals work fine on the same amp. Tested on Two Amps same problem. We simulated same guitar, same amp but new Satchurator pedal from store as a test, and sounded beautiful.	Is it possible I keep getting defective Vox Satchurator pedals from Amazon ? Or am I missing something here ? was bought for my son for Christmas have been disgusted with it since. !!
1,I thought this light was a good buy when I initially purchased it. It was small, bright, & convenient. I used it less than 10 times, and it no longer works. I thought the batteries might be dead, new batteries didn't help. I tried a DC power supply, nope. Dead.		Also, died 1 month after I would be able to return it, so I guess I'm out of luck		Update, forgot to mention. Before it died, I used this item on a music stand when I practiced guitar. The frequency of the flicker of the LEDs was sort of synced up with the frequency of some of the pitches. This created a strange stop motion vibration effect on the strings when those notes were played. It was pretty distracting. The light I bought to replace it doesn't do that.
1,this is a terrible product. it requires 8 D batteries that you have to unscrew the back to install. the batteries are a real pain to install and the manufacturer does not  indicate anywhere how long these are expected to last. the worst part is that mine was doa. after a 20 minute struggle to install the batteries(they are not included) the power light came on and that was it...thats all it did. so after 10 more minutes to remove the batteries and find the screw to hold the back on, i returned it.  this may have been cutting edge five years ago but believe me, you can buy a much better product on the market with rechargeable lawn mower batteries, that are so much easier and better...don't buy this
1,Stopped working after 2 days of use. Only one hour of play each day. Took my other pedal to the grave with it. Pay a little extra and go for a better quality pedal. I'll be saving up for something else. I would rate in negative stars if possible.
1,Giving it two stars because it's marketed as an isolated power supply but it's not.  It seems to be well built so that's good but if you need an isolated power source, this won't work for you.  I have a couple of pedals that make noise if they are run on any kind of daisy chain power supply like a 1-Spot and they made just as much noise with this power supply.		This power supply is basically a 1-Spot in a metal casing.		Another downside is it didn't come with any mounting hardware.		I ended up sending it back because it's not isolated as was advertised.  I ended up buying a Cioks power supply which was more expensive but is isolated and works perfectly with the couple of pedals I have that need an isolated output.		If this was marketed as a non isolated power supply, I would have given it 4 stars but since it's advertised as something it's not, 2 stars is all I will give it.
1,Too much boosting in frequency that it won't stop buzzing
1,I have a very elaborate audio system that utilizes a big rack full of audio equipment and cords/cables running everywhere.  Naturally, this is an open invitation for A.C. hum.  By using fully-shielded, balanced cables wherever possible, and keeping audio cables away from A.C. cables as best that I can, I've eliminated 90% of the hum, but there was still a little bit that's noticeable at times, and I've become obsessed with removing every bit of the noise, so I decided to give this thing a try.  I did not notice any difference.  It might work for reducing higher levels of noise, but if you want to absolutely eliminate every last little bit of A.C. hum....Well, it did not eliminate, or even reduce the level of the last remaining hum on my system, that's all I can say.
1,This is not for a yamaha and the bottom legs are unstable
1,I liked it at first, but grew to hate it - it ended up with a bend in the center of the neck over time at a little burl portion of the maple.  Don't waste your time, the head shape is wrong and classic in-line tuners will have the low E string tuner back slightly sticking off the end of the head stock.  Pocket shape is also slightly off, needed a bit of rounding.  Just spend $70 more and get ALLPARTS or even a Mighty Mite now if you must go on the cheap.  You will be ahead in the end when you pull this one and replace it.
1,Meh, I'm not sure if the the ones I received were just duds, but I didn't really feel these made a significant difference in the sound. They had a very rough texture that I found unpleasant. I'm unlikely to purchase more felt picks without feeling them in person first.
1,After all of the rave reviews I was expecting to be much more impressed.  I use it as a boost since I don't care for the way it colors the sound.  Some like to leave it on all the time, but this supposed "magic" that happens for so many just doesn't for me.  Also, it is rather noisy.  It's the only pedal I am using--going straight into a Blues Jr. And sometimes a vintage Twin reverb.  It does cut through nicely for solos but otherwise just has that highly processed cold tone that I don't care for.  Maybe I need to get a truly transparent boost instead.  I am admittedly not a pedal/effects player.  I like a tube amp with a touch of reverb: that's it.
1,First, you should know I have used a standard Fishman Pro-EQ for over 10 years with great success in large and small church venues, and with amplifiers as well as plugged direct into the system. I have spent three years experimenting with the Platinum Pro-EQ, with little success. Multiple times I have just disconnected it mid-service and put the basic pro-eq back in.		I got this to replace my older Fishman Pro-EQ preamp that had fewer features. I am now back to using the older one. My two guitars are a Taylor 12 string with the ES system, and a Martin dreadnought with the Fishman rare-earth blend sound hole mic/pickup combo. Played through a Fishman Loudbox 100.  I literally have spent hours and hours trying to get something close to the natural sound I get from my old pre-amp to no avail. If it were just one guitar I could see it maybe being my problem, but I just could not get this thing to produce a natural sounding midrange or treble. Using the 1/4 jack, not xlr. Very disappointed in this unit as I had high hopes for maybe a richer sound.		Now, here is the issue...if you have more than one guitar, the "midrange" sweep feature becomes a nightmare. Also, the "smoothness" setting complicates things. Essentially you have two midrange sliders (yamaha guitars have the same thing on board so I know how to use them) First you use one slider to find the generic midrange sound you are looking for, then you use the second slider to fine tune that to a more natural sound, emphasizing bass or treble depending which way you slide it. The problem here is that the "sweet spot" is very, very, very tiny and is different for every guitar. It is not conducive to switching guitars, especially from a 6 to a 12 string.		 On the basic Pro-EQ, it is much easier to just adjust the midrange between guitars. In fact, I made a mark on my pro-eq for my 12 string settings as the sweet spot is easier to find. On this Platinum, I don't think there is a pen small enough to mark the sweet spot on all the settings.		so, bottom line is if you have just ONE guitar, you might get lucky and find the sweet spot for natural sound...or should I say the convergence of all the settings. However, for great sound and easy adjustments between multiple guitars, the basic Pro-EQ is much easier to work with and sounds more natural in my experience.
1,There is nothing wrong with the picks, I just don't like the material they are made out of.  I will stick with Dunlop nylon picks.
1,Cheap quality-feels like cardboard.
1,I was curious about trying these out since I have been using D'addario strings for around 8 years.	One of my strings broke in the middle as I was putting these on! I can't understand how it would break in the middle of the string without even having really been tuned or tightened yet. I'm disappointed. Going to see if I can get a spare sent to me or something as the rest of the strings do sound well.
1,if you play out less than a dozen times a year, sure this thing is fine. but a proper guitar stand needs some weight and strength. "secure lock" is creative writing at best.
1,For the price, it's a decent product. However I recommend you save your money and try some of the newer products on the market.
1,I bought this power supply for my OCD full tone distortion Pedal. I quickly ate through a 9 volt battery and decided to get this based on the recommendation from Guitar center. I got home I I plugged in the power supply to the OCD full tone distortion pedal and instantly I heard an added annoying "hum" almost a buzz static sound coming from my tube amp. I tried moving the power supply away from everything else and no luck the "hum" or buzz sound remained. I thought the pedal cost me $127.40 and I didn't buy it to hear "hum" noise. That being said this product does not do what it is supposed to its going back to guitar center! I will buy the voodoo power supply 2 in the next few months.
1,Not so crazy about these...the rubbery part drags on the strings...
1,great cable! so far, no hums or hisses. Not the most heavy duty, but what do you expect for the money?!		EDIT: after only one use, and a few months of sitting around, it has developed a hum. Very disappointed!
1,This product says in the title that its for a lapel microphone. Unless your lapel mic is the size of an olive this thing won't work. They are way too big.
1,BIG, easy to hold, pointy, consistent.... consistently bad for either strumming or single-note work.		Nylon has an interesting soft sound if the pick has a normal shape, but with this ridiculous acute point, the tone is both tick-tacky thin AND un-dynamic.	The acute angle of the point makes them TERRIBLE for any serious player.	This particular grade of nylon is pretty tough, but like all nylon picks I've ever tried, the wear quickly. So in addition to the initial cost ( which is TOO HIGH) they wear out fast and need replacement.	The grip is good for beginners who have trouble holding on to picks. other than that... not good.		I can't see any reason to ever get these other than to try them out ( as I did) or for beginners with grip problems.	Dunlop makes MANY great products. This is not one of them.
1,Not true bypass. Boosts signal even when switched off. Grounding issues, buzz. Hilariously bad drive/distortion. Somehow manages to filter pinch harmonics and decrease sustain, while accentuating the worst, nasal qualities of the guitar. In that sense, it is almost magically bad. I guess you take your chances with these knockoffs, especially once they realize they can rest on their laurels due to positive reviews.
1,I have no idea how I came across this pick, but over the years, it has become my all-time favorite (0.60mm brain pick in purple). Which is why I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, and instantly ordered 2 boxes - one in 0.60mm and one in 0.73mm.		The day it arrived, I opened the boxes with excitement. Weird. The 0.60mm felt filmsier than mine, and the quality control was bad. If you look at the photo, you'll notice that the edges are not finished properly - it's as if the finished product was just taken out of the plastic mould without any further processing. My old brain pick looks and feels so much better even though it has seen a few years of playing. Not only that, the new picks do not sit flat on a surface - characteristic of poor quality. My old pick still does! It's amazing.		The trademark dots for friction also feel terrible on the new ones. On my old brain pick, the dots feel subtle but extremely effective.		Both boxes had the same issues, so it is not a batch problem. The 0.73mm pick was closer to my old 0.60mm pick in thickness, so I recommend you get that at least if you are playing the acoustic guitar. But these picks are no longer the same... just feels like cheap plastic now.		Until Snarling Dogs improve their quality control and goes back to the old days, my old purple pick will remain a special pick to me. If anyone knows where I can get the old brain picks, please let me know!!!
1,I cant get water to absorb into this thing. No matter how long it sits with a pool of water on top of it, it is still dry and hard as a rock. Waste of time and money IMO.
1,Does not dispense picks as easily as I thought - gets stuck constantly.  I ended up storing my picks in a mini Altoids container - works much better.
1,This is not a genuine Pearse product - this is made in China.
1,I got this as a spare since the price was right. Trouble is that it just won't stay put. It can be placed right then when it is tightened it will move up just a few millimeters too far toward the narrow end. I was able to get it into position and tightened a couple of times then after a few minutes of playing it ended up too high and a tad loose. I have no idea why, since it looks nearly like my other metal ligature except for a little bit of a high spot under the screws.
1,If all you're doing is putting instruments through it's fine, but WARNING THIS HAS NO PHANTOM POWER. I was on a gig and realized that TOO LATE!
1,You shouldn't have to buy RPS to get strings you can bend.... I have been using Ernie Ball Super Slinkies since the 1980s. I love the feel and sound they produce. but I'm done. I have seen too many .09, .10 .11 and .13 strings slip and let go lately. Could it be that it is impossible or too expensive to make them with quality US-made steel?	The pictured string constantly dropped in pitch, making it unusable for playing in public and frustrating for practice.	C'mon Ernie Ball, make usable strings and I will return.	Any suggestions for other strings that feel and sound like Slinkies or Super Slinkies?	Edited for spelling, lol...
1,If I have my Les Paul and a fender, it works well. But 2 fenders or one of any of my other guitars, forget only having one stand....
1,As others have said this is NOT a Martin product. I also followed the directions, wet it, wrung it out and still got a drop of water leaking out of it onto the guitar. Pass this up for another solution.
1,I would not recomment this product.  You get what you pay for.  No diamond in the rough here...just a lump of coal
1,I bought another controller to be able to fade between colors and change colors and it works much better. The music controller can't do either of these well. It does not even respond to music very well. It's a simple microphone input and has no intelligence for beat detection.
1,Cymbal mics quit working after a month or so. Not sure why.
1,APPEARANCE/BUILD	This pedal is VERY Small ! I'll call it 'Mini'_ The Green decor is pleasing to the eyes and the knobs & switch seem just fine....(not loose or cheap feeling/looking) and the housing is standardly strong		DELAY SOUND	Lacking_ I can't get much of a good sound out of it except this one setting..which is actually more Reverb than Delay....	[Time @ 9 O'clock - Mix @ 2 O'clock - Repeat @ 1 O'clock]		I see now there is a reason that this Delay is not showcased on YouTube....it's not worth the time to mess with so many better Delays out there		This is actually my 1st Delay pedal and it was a let down_ I figured ...ah what the heck for $22 ....And it's prolly a decent starter Delay, right ? .... And my Cheap Joyo Flanger and Cheap Cadine Orange Burst Overdrive sound FABULOUS - and they were both around $25-30 so I felt good about the purchase initially but this ain't gunna cut it for even my 1st Delay_ I'm gunna just bust out the $149 for the Echoplex or I may try the Cadine 'Drifter' for $49		My grandson is 6 and has started playing guitar so I think this pedal is going to him_ maybe a 6 yr old will dig it
1,Even if you're a beginner, DO NOT buy this guitar! as soon as i opened the box and saw it, i knew it'd be a piece of junk. the sound is terrible, plugged in or not. save your money up and get a nicer one, not this.
1,This has a definite hum that annoys me when using it. Maybe im not using it right? Nah its pretty self explanatory. There is a hum.	I wish there was a better one that didn't do it.
1,Another defective Yamaha mouthpiece... two in a row !  I ordered a 4C, it was cut off center and the tip rail was asymmetrical.... then I ordered this one, the 5C : it was cut off center and the tip rail was so thin that it was almost non existent. Two defective mouthpieces in a row, from a reputable maker asYamaha? It seems incredible, and I wonder if Amazon inadvertently got a "b" stock of Yamaha mouthpieces ? In any case, I returned both. What a disappointment :-(
1,This has the potential of scratching the finish around the sound hole.	Fiddly to fit.	It is also rather hard to read, and not very accurate or responsive
1,this isn't a toy but I would not suggest this 4 a young student or serious child. The tuners and bridge  are basically trash however the neck and body and pickup even, are pretty decent for an entry level. If you wanted to fix the bad parts it would make a good little guitar but if not I wouldn't bother. go for a squier mini strat and get the best option for price and quality.
1,Sorry but I cannot recommend this to anyone. It's flimsy and does not clamp on the microphone securely. I dropped the clip about 3 feet and it cracked open. I can't really complain as it was only a couple of bucks but, next time I'll spend a little more for a better quality clip.
1,Do not fit Gibson Les Paul stock Shafts.	Break easily.
1,Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. I just didn't want to spend $100 on the Boss version, but you get what you pay for! Another thing that I hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the Boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. I also bought a Behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out.
1,Extension plate looks quite flimsy - mine was bent and didn't align well with the height adjustment slots right out of the box so I'm returning it. Have ordered the Hercules product instead.
1,This tuner is a piece of garbage. Totally useless for tuning a guitar. Won't pick up most notes. The ones that did would bang on and off so accuracy was impossible. I became so frustrated I threw it away.
1,Made in Mexico junk. For half the price you can get better made and better sounding kits from other brands. These sound dull, and don't last long.
1,The design looks good, it has good quality and solid/strong built, the problem is that it is very heavy, the tray is actually heavier than what I was planning to use it for. if you use it in a microphone stand it is so heavy that it might cause the stand to tilt over. it would be good if it was made of a lighter metal. The design of the clamp is nice looking, but not very useful. I have a mixer stand and needed to use this tray to put a couple of little things on it under my mixer. The clamp doesn't fit on the mixer stand, so I cannot use it the way I was planning to. The clamp only fits in those cheap skinny microphone stands, or on the skinny extension portion of a standard microphone stand, it won't fit on a sheet music stand, so the clamp makes the use of this tray very limited, and the screw that is used to tighten the clamp is not protected so it will scratch and leave a mark on whatever stand you use attach it to.
1,This one looked wood grain and black which I wanted, turns out the one that arrived was all black. Returned.
1,Update: Just up and died. I have no idea why. Nothing bad happened to it. It made it through several gigs and then one day, nothing. It was great while it lasted.		What do you expect from Furman besides rock solid reliability when it comes to your power? This is an essential part of my gig bag now. The cable is very generous and can always get power to my rig from anywhere in the clubs that I play. Even if they only have one outlet on stage and the guitar player needs it for all his pedals. I haven't had a chance to test how it handles power problems but so far I haven't had any issues to speak of. (Correction, see Update)		It is SOLID. Well worth the money. This is a no brainer. Every gigging musician should have one in their kit.
1,not what i expected..
1,These are completely unbalanced.  The bridge pickup is so much louder than the neck pickup so when using both pickups the neck pickups are totally drown out.  Additionally the screw adjustments do nothing at the neck pickup.
1,Using this for Let's Play videos on youtube with a Behringer C3 mic and Sampson spider.  It is very solid and very quiet.  Mounting it to my desk with the included clamp is fast and easy and it feels very solid.		[Update]	Having used this for about three months now the upper pivot has become quite rough and makes a lot of noise when moving it. It sounds like the metal is grinding against itself and causes a lot of vibration in the mic, noticeable even through the spider.  I'm not sure what exactly happened with this, it has remained mounted exactly as it was when I first installed it and I would not consider my usage to be excessive either.  I've seen lamp stands modified for this purpose that lasted years without failing, I would expect more from a purpose built solution from a reputable company.		I'll continue using it for now because I can't justify the cost of replacing it when I could be better served by investing in more gear, but it will definitely be the first part of my setup that gets replaced.		Rode, I am disappoint.
1,Sounds....ok.  WAY too much latency for my liking, and is only good for about 3 half steps before it gets really artifacty.  Doesn't suck.  But I demo'd this and the Digitech Drop together and the Digitech sounds better than the PitchFork.  Latency is unavoidable with any pitch shifter, but I'll take the one with the least.
1,All I gotta say about  this product is that I get a volume/tone loss when it's plugged; that is a very big problem for me. Other than that is very well built, but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me.
1,Pros:	Great Delay	Great Reverb		Cons:	Horrible Compressor	Horrible Chorus (you end up tweaking the detune for chorus fx)	Unusable overdrive	Unuasable distortion	Can't use the 4 cable method	Harmonist is full of artifacts	tuner is NOT chromatic	impossible patch bank lay out	eq/noise gate is not useable	Not stereo in!	expression pedal settings won't save	no overall volume control via pedal	DREDFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE		I have owned this unit for several months.  It now collects dust in my studio.  I purchased the Line6 M13 and have never looked back.	There is a reason the Nova System sales have died...Nobody cares about the new "Limited" red units either.		100% Yawn.		Have a nice day.
1,Nice features, terrible quality. The bag is great, and the board size was just perfect for the intended use, but the quality of the board itself was just awful. Unglued corners all over the place, even a missing piece of wood in one of them. Even before the first gig the board looks like it has taking a beating already. Sadly since I live in Mexico it would be too expensive to send it back, but I really regret this purchase.
1,These do not work very well. For some reason the screen will look very faint, as if the battery is dying, then it's fine a minute later. The Snark tuners are much better and worth the extra money.		Update: These are total junk. Now, both go dark and only work occasionally after only about 2 months.
1,although they look cool, they soung like crap. The tones are dull and the fingers do not slide very easily across the strings. I hope this review helps..
1,The cushions are not included which is a bog disappointment to me, the size of the screw are a joke.
1,Didn't work for me.  My $15 pickup works much better.
1,It seems incredible to me that a brand like Fender sell these accessories that apart from having a very large size will unhook too easily.
1,Don't buy it! This amp cuts out REGULARLY. New cord, new instrument, new amp, and it's cutting out every time you strum too loudly, unless the volume on the instrument or amp is just barely up at all. Cute color, terrible sound quality. Spend an extra $15 and save yourself the buyer's remorse.
1,I'm not generally a fan of buying overpriced cables. My usual strategy is to buy double the amount of cheap cables, and have them around as replacements. I'm about to start playing shoes frequently again, so I decided I'd go with a (hopefully) sturdier cable.		I bought 2 and so far, they've been great. I don't know if I can fully justify the $30-$40 price for a 21 foot cable, but I've got some disposable income, so whatever.		These things don't make you sound any better, but they're thick, sturdy feeling cables with low interference that still have a lot of flex to them.		Update from 12/18/2014- I purchased 3 of these cables in total and they all worked great for a few months of constantly gigging at which point they all started showing their wear. I emailed spectraflex and they wanted me to mail them the cables so they could repair or replace them, which puts me out shipping costs and leaves me without cables for a while. At worst, I would recommend Spectraflex cross-ship new cables.		Instead I went to guitar center and bought a bunch of cables that I could get swapped in an afternoon when the time comes. In my opinion, don't waste your time buying cables online. Find some cables with a lifetime warranty that you can exchange pretty easily regardless of location.
1,This is just a piece of a $10.00 lamp at Wal-Mart without the light.
1,Poor quality. The capo is to tight and causes strings to sound sharp.  The metal spring broke after three months.  Do not buy.
1,Loved this mixer, about a month ago channels 1 and 3 went out. Cost more to fix it than I paid for it
1,This doesn't stay on my Soundcraft mixer.  I mean, it'll stretch out and go over the edges, but it's SO stretchy it usually finds a way to pop off.  It's a cheap, nasty nylon or something; I doubt it'll wear like a good canvas--like my old one.		Notice in the picture that they don't shot anything plugged into the mixer.  That's great: if you never plug anything into yours, this will probably do fine.  But with cords hanging off it, you'll be annoyed with this thing coming half off.  Sorta like in the picture!  Keep looking.  Great idea, poorly executed.
1,Sorry folks, but this ain't a Dyna-Comp by any stretch.  My mistake was thinking that this unit would be but a little more control.  The attack control on this thing goes from full-squash to almost nothing.  Unfortunately, besides compressing the daylights out of the signal, it adds some very unpleasant distortion as well - not what it's suppose to do at all.  I should have saved my money for a Keely.
1,Was not expensive but leather was too stiff for my liking	Also made it hard to fit in case when strap is still attached to mandolin
1,Has a hard time staying up sometimes. But you get what you pay for.
1,This is a cool locking strap,but not for a pro or anyone with a pricey guitar..only good for beginners with very cheap guitars...very thin and not sturdy at all..I wouldn't. Even trust strap locs with this poorly made strap..guess 8$ should've been first clue,again if you have a kid who just started playing his cheap guitar then buy this!
1,Sounds great. Snaps easily. Overall, more annoying than worth it.
1,Not a good idea.  The Violin can fall down.
1,The only reason this gets 1 star is because I can't give it 0 stars.		What they don't tell you:	- Has terrible delay/sync issues.	- Frequent data errors.	- Stops working for no reason.	- Breaks without warning		I COUNDN'T EVEN USE IT IN MY FIRST SHOW! It didn't last that long. THE THING LITERALLY STOPPED WORKING!!!!		DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CHEAP PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!! Do yourself a favor, save yourself headache and just save up a little more to buy a $70 DMX controller. You'll thank yourself. I spoke with an amazing lighting engineer who recommended the "DMXking ultraDMX Micro USB DMX adapter/dongle." Which they do sell on Amazon.		When I bought the other controller it was a NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE. I'm sure there's many more that are just as good, that's just the one that was recommended to me and it works great!!! Zero delay and clean response.		Once again, DO NOT BUY THIS!!! IT IS GARBAGE!!!!
1,I've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go "flat" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster.
1,It is not the same one as shown for sale. The shockmount shown is an actual Blue shockmount not the one you will receive. The ones I received have different screw mount coupling, different color suspension. The screw mount has a cheap plastic handle. It appears that the microphone shock mount shown is actually the Blue shock mount and NOT the Weymic Wms-1 Universal Microphone Shock Mount. But the key point here is that it will NOT fit my Blue Baby Bottle (US made) as advertised.  Take a look at my photos.	Update: the seller took immediate action and within one day the listing was updated to reflect the correct photos and no longer listed the Blue  Baby Bottle as a compatible microphone.
1,garbage. did not work out of package. have to bend for it to work.
1,Very cheaply made tuners and one knob was missing
1,DID NOT FEEL RIGHT
1,I like the idea of the micro tuners and own a couple but this one is useless. While trying to tune my mandolin this tuner does not show what note each string is tuned to. There is a tiny strip of light at the top of the screen that illuminates red, yellow or green but, when I checked the tuning with another tuner, the NS Micro tuner was off. It ended up in the drawer with all the other stuff I've bought over the years that didn't work as advertised. Too bad as I'm a big fan of D'Addario products, usually....
1,Nice strap but not long enough for me
1,I was disapointed it is size. It is extremely small, maybe two inches at best.  It works just fine but way to small for my liking.  You almost always loose it in your gear.
1,The stand is good, like all Hercules stands, but the yoke is too narrow for a standard classical guitar. The specs here and on the Hercules site did not provide dimensions, so I decided to take a chance. Wasted money. I will use it on other guitars, but alas I cannot use it on the guitar for which I need a good reliable stand.
1,Had I known what I was getting I would never have ordered it.  There are gig bags and there are gig bags.  I've ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags.  I expected more. This one offers almost no protection.  The only reason I have not returned it yet is that the return shipping will leave little to refund, but may end up returning it anyway.		It *did* fit my Kala KA-TG with room to spare.
1,Previously had American DJ version of this product,very similar,but not as many features. Now don't get me wrong,I like alot of Chauvet products and they have improved over the years,but this one could not handle the workings of a mobile DJ. My previous controller lasted me over 2 1/2 years and I used it alot! The Chauvet piece lasted just over 1 year(should have gotten service contract)it came apart several times and after last repair,it just stopped working. Now I didn't beat the s#*^t out of it,but it was for a mobile set up. I would have to say that if you install it in a permanant location you would probably get more out of it,but I'm amazed by all the positive reviews I see on it,oh well maybe mine was made on friday afternoon,but I will not purchase another one like this again.
1,I realize a lot of people have rated this high, but I question their reviews. There are a couple of problems with this device. The first issue is channel bleed. For example, if you play music from your computer it will bleed through to your RCA input. Doesn't anyone else notice this? The other issue is the recording levels from my 10 channel mixer is too low. In order to achieve decent recording levels I have to turn the mixer channels to the max, but when you do that you will experience overdrive clipping. This device is ok if all you want is a simple and portable solution, but in no way is this suitable for any type of production work. I would not recommend this.
1,I have owned bags made by Beato in the past (1990's) and I still have them around!!! However these are nothing like those ones!!!!!  I have had these less than 6 months and already there is a rip in one bag and several holes caused by minor scratches in the others.  These are thin and weak little bags. there is no padding, insulation or anything resembling a second layer inside. Needless to say I pack my drums into these approximately one times a week for 4-6 months (to bring them to church and back) and these are not the protection for my drum I thought they would be.  These cases are little more than simply putting a handle on each of your drums to make them easier to carry.  if something bumps up against your drums while in these cases make no mistake it will still leave a nice scratch or dent on the drum inside. I dunno, for the price I just thought they'd be made of a little stronger stuff.
1,The pick up doesn't stay stuck on at all.  Everytime I pick up the guitar the pickup is on the floor.
1,This particular cover did NOT fit my Frontman 212R. I got one from MF and it fit perfectly. Maybe some covers are made in countries with different measurements, like with clothing. The shipping was on time.
1,The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. It's cheap and easy to use. It'll do the job, but I don't like it.
1,Shipped way before est., but prepped before I realized it was a chinese product-otherwise I'd have cancelled the order. A simple note: if the product you're looking at is from china-find a different product unless you don't mind getting something you inevitably can't fix and therefore can't use. I figured whatever flaws it had would be manageable; I was wrong.		Tuning key slots are WAY too big and are unevenly spaced-rendering the neck unusable, add to that the fact that it doesn't fit in the guitar they advertise it for even after sanding the gloss off the butt. What a pretty waste of money/space/time/patience this neck has been.		Don't buy-no matter what you're thinking; don't buy these damn necks!!!
1,It does what it says it does. But I didn't find this useful.
1,I should be able to install my software on my laptop and desktop without needing a $50 usb stick that I need to move.
1,I wanted to use this alongside another Focusrite Scarlett to give me extra inputs and outputs... Guess what? Focusrite units are not compatible with each other. You can't run two Scarletts simultaneously (even if they're both 2nd gen). That's a total deal breaker! I'll be selling my Focusrite gear on eBay.
1,Seriously weak strobe light, it could barely light up 1/4 of a room, it didn't really strobe as much as pulse.  Ultimately I ended up sending it back to Amazon.
1,I am a guitarist and vocalist, and I use a power amp to amplify both in a live setting. I was hoping this would be both lighter and more powerful than my RAMSA WP-9220, which is 45 lbs, and drives 2 x 300 Watts into 4 ohms, which with the band was always too loud. The GTD, rated  at2 x 350 Watts into 8 ohms will start clipping long before either signal I amplify meets level with the band at their quietest, it also lacked the high end I was able to achieve. Given that was my only purpose for it, and I sold my RAMSA, it was sorely disappointing. Perhaps you'll have better luck with this if you are intending for something much quieter than I was.		Perhaps its important to bear in mind wattage ratings do not equal loudness.
1,Cheaply made.
1,6 left tuners, this is ridic
1,Might work for extremely light weight microphones, but my application involved using it with a wireless mic and it could not keep it in an upright position.  the mic kept dropping down and resulting in several complaints. Will not be buying again or recommending to anyone.
1,I liked the idea of a clip on tuner, and these worked, but the socket the arm attaches to on the back of the tuner is fragile. Mine broke in short order, but i did not abuse them. It is just a bad fragile design. I wasted money on two of these and now cant use them.
1,Cheaply made, and cheap looking.  Sounded below avg even for a Squire.  I returned it.  I knew it wasn't a Paul Reed Smith, but it was definitely less than expected.  Spend the extra money and get a Squire Telecaster Affinity ($180) or a Fender Strat Standard ($500).  I have both and would easily buy them again.  Thanks.
1,Sounded good, I had a high frequency noise that was unacceptable.
1,This is the 2nd one of these that I have bought. First one was a floor used demo.....would not do anything but make my lights flash or turn them off if any other button pressed. Returned that one. Decided maybe if I got a new unit it would be okay. This one is BRAND NEW OUT OF THE BOX.....works lights fine .......BUT fixture 2 will turn light OFF when deactivated. It should just leave as set and not change. Also sound active mode does not work AT ALL!!! Frustrating....as this is the SECOND unit to have issues. This is also being returned. So I would say ...save your money a buy a higher end dmx controller for a extra $50 over the cost of this unit.
1,I received this (after asking for it) for Christmas as a gift. This is not a good product. It does not work. The software supplied with it is dated and obsolete, and doesn't install in Windows 10 but as a well trained computer expert, I should have had no trouble with making it work. I did not succeed in doing so before I decided that this thing is just not worth the effort. I'll be returning this and I do not recommend that anyone buy it. I have not (yet) found an inexpensive yet useful guitar to computer interface other than Rocksmith with it's native required cable.
1,I bought it and read the instructions carefully. The upper holes make a sound just fine but the lower holes do not change the pitch at all. Maybe they sent a bad reed? Doesn't look rosewood, is painted a flat black all over. Directions are hard to follow and shouldn't be since I have played music most of my life. The CD is music only and helps very little. I am going to have to buy another type or kind. I really do want to learn to play bagpipes.
1,This arrived and when I tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some  oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapter.		  Instead, these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip, so now I have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck AND a clip.		  This is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths...
1,Were bent up when I received them, but did not send back. Others I purchased were much better.
1,Very cheaply made and doesn't work well . Surprised and disappointed to see a bad product from Tascam .
1,This stand is only good for a uke!  It will NOT support the weight of a mandolin.  It tips backwards VERY easily.
1,This is just a little too cheesy for me to use with a fine uke.  I don't fault if for being slightly flimsy (it's adequately stable), but there are plastic caps on the front that may harm my finish but I'm not going to try it and see.  I'll give it to someone who has a less precious instrument.
1,Microphone died on me within a day. I'm not sure what the issue is. The microphone records extremely quietly. I had to have the gain turned up to 100% and be right next to it to get a usable signal. I replaced my interface and cables both several times because I assumed that the microphone itself wouldn't be the issue as I trust the Rode brand. However, after using multiple interfaces, it seems like the microphone itself is the issue. Might order another one since I've heard great things about this microphone and maybe I just got a lemon. Will update in the future.		UPDATE 11/3/2017:	I received a new replacement and had the SAME problems. I tested it with different cables and different interfaces and got the same result. To  be sure, I also tested a different microphone, an AT2020, and had no issues with the same cables and same interfaces. I tested all the combinations of these. So, conclusion. I got 2 malfunctioning microphones in a row I guess. Underneath all of the static and noise, I can hear a good tone. It's a shame that none of it can be usable. I guess I won't be ordering a Rode microphone anymore. Don't know if I should risk it a third time. Will update!
1,Not a very good product, low grade metal, the teeth are not well shaped and it does not grip as well as my old ESP brand one that wore out after 5 years of almost daily use.
1,Will be making my own bracket.  Pop filter is fine, but you have to do a lot to actually get it to get it in the proper location.
1,its a fun toy to mess around with, but thats about it. Sucks tone and is very cheaply made. Doesnt harmonize well.
1,With the launch of iOS 10.3, we now have easy access to a list of apps that are 32-bit right on our devices.  These apps will stop working in future releases of iOS.		DigiTech Stomp Shop is on that list.		If this were just a basic sound generating app then we could just move on to another app.		However, this app is NECESSARY to program the DigiTech iStomp pedal hardware.  When the app stops working, the pedal is stuck with whatever profile you last used.  Forever.		I've already reached out to DigiTech / Harman and they confirmed that there will be no more updates for this app.		Disappointed that I invested in multiple iStomp pedals for their flexibility but will suddenly lose that primary feature for want of an app update.		I understand why they won't update it from a business perspective. However, it still makes me want to look at other companies that DO support legacy products and care about their end users more.		I'm already looking for an older iOS device to keep as an iStomp  Profile library / backup.  Make sure to backup your devices to iTunes, as the app may also disappear from the App Store once it's obsolete.		Back when it launched, I would have given the iStomp 4 stars.		Now that it will potentially be limited to just 1 effect, it doesn't make any sense to buy this pedal.
1,I hate to knock three starts out since I might have gotten a defective unit.  However, my experience with the Evans Torque key was not as positive as most of the other users. I followed the instructions very closely but was not able to get the key to actually lock in place even at the highest tension. With that said, as expected from evans, the key is built quite well and seems to be rugged to take some road beating. I might try another one in the future due to the many positive reviews, but until then I ended up biting the bullet and going with the Tune-bot which works perfectly.
1,This is just "ok" for a tuner. I've tested about 8 different vibration tuners and this one comes out close to the bottom. The biggest thing I don't like about it is the swivel. I like to put my tuner down close to the nut (instead of at the top of the headstock), but I can't with this one because the swivel is limited 360 and the screen does not have its own pivot. Also, the battery compartment is a bit on the flimsy side. I gave it 2 stars for the display brightness and the accuracy seems pretty good.		If you want a great tuner that's very flexible when it comes to screen postion, check out the Intellitouch PT10 Mini. I haven't found a better tuner yet.
1,I bought this for my Canon Vixia HF G10 Video Camera and a Shotgun Mic that I recently purchased for it. I needed a 12" wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the Mini Advanced Shoe) to the microphone plug on the Video Camera...		The wire on this thing is *not* 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8" long itself. I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... I'd have rated it 1 star, but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 (Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike) and it worked out ok. Still a tight fit though (since there's only 8" of wire)...		I'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.		Also, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but I hear a hiss when recording. Again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not (or my shotgun mic).
1,This should be fine for kids.  Don't believe the comments in "Questions/answers" about this being 53 or 56 inches long; it is not that long.  The product descriptions show 38", and that is about right.  It was too short for me (6'0", 175 lbs) on a tenor uke.  It should be 6 or 8 inches longer to be useful and user-flexible.  Thank goodness I bought it from Amazon!  No problem!
1,This pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like CRAZY! You will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit.		I'm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either- there are a LOT of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable.		Over all I would not recommend this product.
1,Noisy, unwanted POS!
1,had to return it back.... headphone volume wasn't that clear to me...
1,Do not buy.		For the following reasons I will tell everyone I know not to buy this item:		1. Assembly should have been easy; I have put together dozens of these stands, however, the colored stickers on this particular stand, per instructions, did not line up. Unacceptable.		2. Tried to force the colored piece ends together and bent all the pieces and cut my hand. Unacceptable.		I am returning this item. Do not buy.
1,WARNING: These are Special 20 Progressives and not Special 20 Marine Bands as shown in the picture. These harmonicas are of much lower quality than the Special 20 Marine Bands and not recommended. Do yourself a favor and buy individual Special 20 Marine Bands instead of these inferior products.
1,Umm, apparently the saying "you get what you pay for" comes to play.. Gotta twist the guitar sideways in hopes of twisting to fit. Don't hang anything heavier than a Guitar Hero controller on it, it's weak and cheezy. 5 minutes of hanging a solidbody electric and the arms are loose, they're connected to the base via rivets and we know how stolid they need to be. By the way, didn't come with any mounting hardware.
1,This particular brand I've seen around and haven't heard to much about them, but the one that I got worked fine for about a couple days. It went out and I sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that I MIGHT have gotten a bad one. And I requested in a letter when I sent it in that they send another one in exchange, That didn't work out so well, with that being the only way I COULD RATE it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one, I'd have to rate this one at the bottom...
1,One of the pins was clearly broken inside the packaging. Wasn't worth sending back.
1,This didn't fit me very well, it also jabbed me in the chest.  Build quality is good (not excellent, but quite good).		Shoulder rests are a hit-or-miss until you find one that fits you well, so the fact that it didn't work for me doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it for others.  If it was bendable metal, I would probably keep it and try to customize it so it fits me well enough.
1,I ended up trying to chase the harp around as the thing flexed and moved. I like the fact that it has two adjustments so you can get the angle of the harp good, but didn't work out for me.
1,Spend the money and get something decent as these just strip out with the first bit of tension. I got 1 out of 4 and that's all I needed
1,ABSOLUTE S***. DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH THESE.
1,It's a good ideal but the big problem I have is if Ya are using a tube Amp. ( have a 65' Twin Reverb Fender tube ) Ya get one HELL of a HUM. It's so bad I just can't use it at all. I'm not sure about a transistor Amp. but who uses those ????
1,It was built fine but it wasn't compatible with my Marshall DSL-40C. Returned it and the company was great in getting me the real Marshall switch instead.
1,this item wasn't shipped with all the necessary parts and supplies need but t-motorsports took care of everything for me and everything worked out
1,I didn't have this 3 months before it broke. The plastic piece just snapped in half after very light use. Looks great! Shame it isn't functional.
1,Not a big fan. I'll stick with my jazz iiis.
1,This tuner is terribly designed! It has a very tiny on button that is invisible and difficult to both find and operate. If you leave your finger on the on button more than 1 second, it changes everything on the tuner, and you have to go through 5 steps to reset it, very disruptive when playing music. I would recommend one with a bigger on button, on it's front, and different color button than rest of tuner. Don't waste your time on this one. I'm returning mine today. Also, the sign for sharp notes # is so tiny you can hardly see it, and I play in tunings that use sharp notes. For chromatic this tuner is worse than worthless.
1,If getting this strap for a 5yr old then go for it, other wise it is way too small for 8yrs on up
1,yes. this mixer was great until it just suddenly stops working for maybe after a year or two! I am so devastated with this. I do music vocal recoridngs and this one just stops working, it means i need ot buy another expensive pre amp? huh
1,I run karaoke, so I wanted a smaller device to replace my rack sized DBX compressor and graphic eq; less to carry to venues. This is a nice device, but it doesn't work well when connected to a mixer with effects. It channels out the effects put on mics. I use echo to help weak singers, but it got rid of the effect, and singers ended up sounded flat. It also made their voices to pronounced over the music. I tried so many different configurations, but nothing really worked so well. The other problem...it takes out sustained bass sounds. I played a song with strong bass, and if a bass line was to be sustained, it played the first beat, but the sustained part went away.		I really wanted to like this device to make my life easier, but I ended up going back to the two, larger devices it was suppose to replace. I tried using it is a direct box for the mics, but it still took the effects I put on them away, and made people sound flat...even my best singers doing songs they always do...still came out sounding flat. I use SM58's, and though it boosted the signal a bit, making people sound flat just isn't a good thing.
1,The system is easy to mount and the cymbal is easy to attach BUT the mounting system TOTALLY ruins the thread even after just one tightening! They need to find a better system to secure it to the stand or even a thread though different brand use different sizes....
1,This product would be OK if it didn't keep breaking and would work overall better if it didn't come apart into two pieces.		However, the ball joint easily breaks just when you are trying to position it while on the guitar or while in storage in your case.  Both happened to me within two months.  I'm not careless.  These are just too brittle.		Furthermore, I kept using one even with the broken tab but then it fell out of the ball joint and fell about 3 or 4 feet onto tile flooring.  That was the end of it -- the electronics don't work and a new battery didn't help.		It is just a very poor design.		A one-piece design with a permanent ball joint would have been much better.		It is also a pain in the behind to have two pieces to store.  Why should I have to look for pieces and put them together every time I want to use it?  I can try to store it while the pieces are together, but they come apart.  This is actually how my first one broke -- just from it sitting my guitar case being hauled around.
1,does not protect guitar, keeps dust off.
1,This is my second one of these. K&M is always a good choice for sturdy gear. And these bars are heavy duty. However, the thumbscrews always stick and are a real bear to unstick without a tool. Not a big deal in the studio, but really annoying on stage. Not sure if it's the paint or the tolerance on the slots. I need to modify these to fix that! 2 stars only because K&M should have fixed this before putting them out for distribution!!
1,Did not stay put on my vintage 1947 say and in the end I just learned how to hold it better without hurting my thumb.
1,Guitar case is good but I've ordered 3 (not from the same vendor) and they all had messed up latches or they didn't close right.
1,As a 10-year veteran podcaster, I am a bona fide geek when it comes to audio recording equipment and I've tried just about everything that has come out during that span. The technology has truly advanced from the time I first started podcasting and I held out high hopes for this Marantz Professional MPM-1000 18mm Condenser Microphone. It was promoted on this Amazon page as being a great "entry-level price" providing "recording studio-quality sound" for "podcasting projects" while cutting out "background noise." Hey hey hey, that's my wheelhouse, so let's try this thing!		Right out of the box, it is indeed a very professional-looking microphone and I had great expectations it would be ready for prime time within minutes of being out of the box. Unfortunately, that's just not the case. First, the tripod is pitiful. You could almost do just as well finding three twigs to balance the microphone on than this thing. As heavy as the mic is, it needs to be more stable. Second, the entry level price is $49, but how exactly would someone use it for a podcasting project when the other end of the microphone isn't a USB? You need to buy an adapter like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/THIS-ONE/dp/B00ZSCQ0ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">THIS ONE</a>&nbsp;which may or may not be reliable. Why didn't Marantz include this adapter knowing podcasters would need it to plug into their computer to record? Seems obvious to anyone who actually uses it for this purpose.		This may or may not be a great-sounding microphone, but these basic flaws in understanding the podcasting world make this product less than ideal. I HIGHLY recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Whiteout/dp/B014PYGYRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blue Microphones Yeti USB Microphone - Whiteout</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samson-Meteor-Mic-USB-Studio-Microphone-Chrome/dp/B004MF39YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samson Meteor Mic USB Studio Microphone (Chrome)</a>&nbsp;instead since they work right out of the box. Hope this helps you make an informed decision.
1,First of all, the item arrived completely disassembled.  There were no installation instructions included either.  I have a PRS SE Custom 24 guitar and the claw screws for this guitar are mounted more narrow than the holes in the Van Rosa claw so you'd either have to re-drill the PRS claw screw holes or file out the holes in the Van Rosa claw.  It is definitely not an exact fit.  If you have a Strat, I'm sure it would fit fine but not in the PRS SE guitar.  I sent it back.  Also, the small screw to attach the ground wire would not screw in all the way.  It got stuck half way in so it was impossible to tighten it.  All in all, a disappointing purchase.
1,I really wanted to like this guitar. I played it for a couple of weeks, hoping the flaws would stop bothering me, but I finally realized I just had to overlook too much to feel okay keeping it. I sent it back.		First of all, the good things. It sounded good, really good, what with the P90s and the fully hollow body. I think the Casino Elitist sounded better, a little richer and more solid, but it was close; really they were both good sounds, just different, almost coming down to personal preference. And the action felt good, too, low and fast. The quality of the woodwork was good overall, except for a clumsily-cut curve in the headstock, which disappointed me because, to my eye, this nice little arc carved on each side of the headstock is part of the iconic design of the Casino, a nice little detail that sets it apart from its Gibson cousins. The polyurethane finish was well done, smooth and even.		But the stain was another story. It was applied in blotches, and you could see streaks and sponge marks where the stain had been allowed to dry too much before wiping off, or something of this nature. Streaky, ugly, blotchy. Not good.		The pots appeared to be cheap, and when you twisted them, they wobbled on their axis rather than spinning straight. This did not inspire confidence; I feared for their longevity.		But the frets were the deal killer. The fret job was abandoned halfway to completion. Maybe they thought nobody would notice. Maybe a lot of people wouldn't. Here's what they did: the frets were pressed into the fingerboard, the ends smoothed off, and the frets were leveled with a file or belt sander. Then some worker began the job of crowning the frets with a fret file . . . and there it ended, throw the guitar in a box and ship it out the door. The crowning was never completed, so the tops of the frets were not properly rounded, but were left way too flat, too wide. And the file (or belt sander) marks had not been sanded smooth, so the harshly flat tops of all the frets had ridges in them like corduroy! Imagine what that feels like when you play it. Bend a string and instead of a nice smooth feel--and sound--you get this grinding feel, and a grinding sound as well. It was kind of funny, kind of funky in a dime-store cheapo guitar way, like some $29 Woolworth guitar one of those old real roots Chicago blues guys might have played back in the '50s . . . but for a guitar at this price point, a guitar that's trying to be a real grown-up guitar instead of a toy guitar--this is completely unacceptable. Laughable really, deserving of scorn. Where was quality control? Or is this the standard the once-proud Epiphone company has set for itself? I will never know the answer, but I do know I will never risk buying one of these junkers again. It cost me over 80 bucks to ship this guitar and case back to the online store I bought it from--they shipped the guitar and case separately, so two boxes, two FedEx bills--so, expensive experiment.		Too bad, because I really wanted to like this guitar.
1,I'm sorry but I have a pod xt live, first hd500x is not fun to play, its flat/dull.pod xt live is so simple it's FUN to play and sounds great!!! then	dialing good sounds is like pulling teeth on hd500x,on pod xt live so simple and sounds great.for hdpod its like a pod xt live with added effects and then make it ten times harder to to get a useable sound. its 2016 and both have been out  while and still I use the xt live. I just cant make peace with the podhd500x.sorry but cheap f/x added to xtlive models just don't cut it which is what 500 sounds like. I prefer smaller screen indented in plastic on pod xt live as I don't need some drunk a#$wipe redneck with boots steppin on the podhd500x's low fi b/w screen.true,the hd500x playing feel is better than pod xt live but makes you lazy playing wise lol. the modeling sounds so similar on both to me but really  harder to get dialed in on500. I guarantee you that in a recording no one can tell the difference between the two. I know I recorded with both even in the same track and still no one could tell any difference.
1,I bought this to make a new guitar. With excitement I immediately took it out and lined up a templet to see how i wanted to build and ALL of the frets OFF. I mean ALL of them!!! How can they send something like this. Even if it was free....it's useless!!!!	Beware!!!!
1,Pretty small and cheap material. I'm only keeping it because it's not worth the hassle of returning it.
1,The only reason I'm giving this two stars is it's under $25.  At moderate settings the fuzz is okay.  However, when you crank the	gain there's so much fuzz you can't even hear the note you're playing.  The controls are packed so close together they are	hard to turn.  It's made of plastic and can only handle light use.  This is one of those cases where you get what you pay for.
1,I've played EXL110 for years and loved them, using hundreds of sets, but I think something most have changed with the production.  I've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month.  All three were on gigs and now I'm stressed a set won't even make it through a whole show.  Come on D'Addario.
1,The connectors are WAY too bulky...too much space between the pedals!!
1,The EcooPro SC-800 is crap doesn't work the only thing that is good to say is that it is all metal. will not buy or recommend again
1,When I pay top dollar for a Rode product I expect it to work in a professional environment and this product has been a disappointment. Yes, it does isolate the handling noise of a boom pole quite well but the rubber bands do not support the weight of my Rode NTG-3 mic. The mic sags in the bands and tends to fall out of the mount in use. Good thing the mic cable was still holding the mic or my mic would have crashed to the ground several times. Plus, you look like a fool when you flub the take because your mic slid out of the mount. I even wrapped a rubber band around the mic base to "catch" on the mount's rubber and the mic still slid out of the mount. This mount sort of works on a static boom but is pretty much worthless on a hand held boom pole.
1,I can't believe this shady company is still getting away with selling their COMPLETELY OVERPRICED cables.  Why are people still duped by the idea that these are ANY better than your standard Planet Waves cables, for instance.  Ask any true audiophile or serious musician, and they will tell you: these are a complete scam, marketed to suckers.  Stop buying them.
1,Quality control is horrible	I will try to reorder
1,Cheap stuff.  Cheap price.
1,Horrible! the B string is abnormally long and thick did not fit through the bridge, the string itself is longer than all the strings combined, makes no sense. you can't cut it to length because its so thick it won't fit. What a waste of time and money, what were thinking about, ah stand up bass!
1,Not fully MIDI compatible.  I burned an entire day writing some python code to handle incoming MIDI data on a linux box and I was getting erratic behavior.  I'd see a Note On on channel 5, then the note off coming in on channel 0.  The next note was Channel 0 On, and Channel 0 off.  Tried my other keyboard and set to Channel 8.  I got a Note On coming in on channel 8, but the Note Off coming back in on Channel 1.  Put in an old USB adapter of mine (midisport 2x2) and suddenly no problems.		Can't take credit for the explanation, but the one I found on a blog comment was "[it's] sticking a 0x90 in front of every message of 2 bytes."		This *might* work for you if you are doing some basic stuff - depends on your needs.  But if you need something dependable for code, or are a live performer, look elsewhere.
1,Sadly, these strings were suggested as replacements for a Yamaha Guitalele GL-1.	They are not compatible. They are gauged E-e, rather than A-a, and will not fit on the bridge or nut. I am giving it two stars because I can use two of the strings to replace the middle.	Overall, I am disappointed that these would be suggested, but I guess Im the big dummy that wasn't aware and didn't do my due diligence while trusted the recommendation.	If anyone has replaced ALL of the stings on their GL-1, please let me know what you used. Thank you.
1,These humidipaks are great and work just like they are supposed to. That being said. I will never again buy more than one at a time and use it immediately. I purchased several to save money. Several months later when I opened a new package I discovered the packets had leaked and they were useless. Too late for any returns. Money out the window.
1,This is not original product. I'm not satisfied.  Too late to return :(
1,I would have given them a 5 for this unit. But crazy updating process, registration this and register that. The Monkey 6 upgraded like half dozen times before it didn't tell me there was another upgrade..They couldn't just upgrade to the latest version, had to upgrade from 1.01 to 1.32 or something like that...silly.	Unit is great and has many bells and ...	Like that it can be linked to Sony Acid Music to record songs.	After upgrading, the headphones no longer work. The search on their site doesn't come back with a reply. Looking for someone to email a question to.	Online video skips the most important part - getting the unit connected.	Still don't have the headphones working. Tried installing the Reason software and won't take the license code from the card attached to the disk. Can only be this number. Now I have to see if I can get a hold of them too.. What a waste of time.  Please, can it be any more screwed up?	Makes me wonder if this is worth it. I have an amp and doesn't takes days to plug it in and use it. Amazon says there are only 5 units left. I bought this days ago and site still says on 5 left.	There is NO help on line and I found a phone number but is only M-F during the time that I work.  They most likely will take hours to answer and refer me to the useless, good for nothing web sites that make you run circles and do nothing to help. \ Update 7+17-2011 ->  Started up the unit today and tells me there is no driver. Tried starting over from scratch and the line 6 Monkey download froze.	Again no help from them. Love their amps and this one is great if it would work!
1,RETURNED
1,Just got it today and I'm so disappointed. This pedal sounded like an overdrive. I've been playing for 30 years so I know what a chorus pedal is. When I turn it on, it gives that overdrive pedal sound with just a tiny bit of chorus. Maybe this one is just defective so I'm returning it and give the Classic chorus a shot. Hope it'll be better this time.
1,You do get what you pay for.	The amplifier barely does that. It is loud, but the sound is crude and the adjustment knobs improve the quality very little. It's little more than a sound box; perhaps a good starter amp.for a child.	The carrying case is very, very small. A full-size guitar, acoustical bass or electric bass, does not come cloe to fitting inside. The case is shorter in length than the picture indicates, and when open, does not envelope much.		I cannot recommend anything but the 10' cord in this package. Suggesting anyone considering this product package upgrade and commit a few more dollars to a quality amplifier. And buy the case separate. I took one for the team here.
1,"works great and is very low profile. very functional, well thought out. hard to see when you put it behind the neck of a guitar. easily adjusts."		that was my review from two years ago, now i'm wondering why it's not working any more. tried several new batteries. it blinks on and off while trying to tune, not functional any more. yet the display will stay steady in metronome mode, or when turning on or off.	very strange way to die. i really like the way it's so low profile, don't want a larger one. afraid to order another one of these....
1,bought as christmas gift and none of the buttons or controllers on left hand side as well as the number 5 button on right hand side work.	thought i was buying new!
1,The sounds are only good for the initial tuning but no good for fine tuning. If compared with an electronic Boss TU-12H tuner the sounds are off. I bought 4 of these pitch pipes they are all off one way or the other.
1,Used to swear by these until we tried to use it with some gear that needed to pass FCC/CE RF testing. These emit a HUGE amount of RF interference, and there's no way they're FCC/CE tested or approved. Shame on Visual Sound for selling these without bothering to make sure they don't pollute your signal chain.		These supplies (we tested several) were all way over the limit by a huge amount (+35dB, which is more than 3000x the allowed amount). This causes other equipment to pick-up this interference, and any even slightly imperfect metal-to-metal contact will demodulate the noise down into the audio range. That's why people are complaining about these being noisy. They are. Wrapping the entire length of the cable around a huge RF torroidal filter doesn't get rid of the noise, that's how loud they are!		The best thing about these is they put out 1700mA of power, but there are others that beats this with 2000mA of current and don't spew the RF noise.
1,I gave this one a shot based on good luck with some other Behringer pedals. This Chorus pedal creates (to my ears) a cheap, toy-like effect that didn't do much to the synth signals I ran through it. The buttons on the device offer a few differences in sound, but they don't offer any versatility of dialing in a tone. I'd recommend saving your $30 and applying to something more substantial for a chorus effect.
1,The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not "lite",  I prefer that one above this model.
1,i FOUND THIS ITEM 30,00 CHEAPER ON ANOTHER WEBSITE	THE ITEM IS GOOD IF YOU USE IT IN YOUR RESTROOM	THAT IS ABOUT HOW MUCH AREA IT COVERS
1,I have ordered a bunch of Eddies products. All seem to be very high end. Eddie doesn't just slap his name on a product to make money. I own his pickups, pedals. So I was excited to get these strings. Well when they came I strung up my guitar and got to jamming. Great strings! They sounded great, easy to play and great feeling. But I noticed with in 2 days they were going bad. I clean my strings after every use with Tonegears string cleaner, so I was very bummed. I thought maybe a got a bad set. So I strung up another set and the same thing. Went through 3 sets in a week. I was very disappointed. I play about 2-3 hours a day and always clean em afterwards. Just was really surprised they didn't last. I landed up going back to Ernie Ball super slinkys. At least with the super slinkys I can get a week out of them and they cost less. This doesn't take away from Eddies products. He doesn't put out junk, he has a lot of control over what he allows his name to go on. Never had issues with my Flanger or Phase 90. Love my EVH frankenstein pup. Just the strings weren't for me I guess. I play rock n roll, 70/80/90's stuff along with some modern tunes and a little jazz. Hope this helps any one on the fence about these strings. Buy a set and try them out first. I wish I did, instead I bought 3.
1,I like the sound of the strings, and I love the feel of them. They don't eat up my fingers like regular strings do, but they wear out so fast. It's already worn where I pluck with my fingers, and I am very disappointed since I have not even had them that long. Now it looks like s***,and I want to replace them just so they don't look that way.
1,I ordered the CA-30 but was sent a different model - they claimed the CA-30 was no longer made.  I always thought that if a product was discontinued a product of equal or better quality and cost would be sent out.
1,Probably should go without saying, but this is, and sounds, more like a toy than an instrument.  Looks very cheary though...
1,As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult, so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.		There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price.
1,I bought a package of 2 of these bulbs to try in my RV before replacing all of the bulbs. I wanted to save power while boondocking. The bulbs were great at first, bright and used very little power from the RV battery. Then, as other reviewers have stated, some of the diodes started not lighting after only a very few hours' use. I had planned to buy more of these bulbs but instead I'll be going back to the old-style bulbs we've all used for decades, but at least those are dependable.
1,Good product. Has a nice overdrive warm tone. 2 stars because there is some issue with the left output connection which causes a huge drop in output gain unless you wiggle it a bit to get a proper connection. Looks defective or perhaps a recon product.
1,My pedal is exactly as described in the battery eating, red light blinking, failing descriptions. It failed like this in day one. Battery lasted about an hour. I bought a daisy AC adapter to see if it gets livable. When functioning, it isn't impressive. Better buy something better. Like the reviewers say, don't be cheap. Good advice
1,Hi! I clearly remember buying a set of 10 normal light strings D'Addario (10-46). And i just received one set of strings. I mean ... apparently you made a mistake. you sent me a package of one set of strings, when in fact buy the set of 10. I really need to solve my problem because i want to keep my instrument working. I hope you can help me to give my opinion on the matter.		Thanks in advance for your attention...
1,Horrible, stiff cables that are more or less locked in the position they came in. Other Hosa cables have more flex to them, which is what I was expecting here. Seriously, stiff cables are the worst.
1,Only got one brush when there should have been two.  The brush did not retract.  Over all - very cheaply made and not worth the time or money. I returned the item and ordered from another company.
1,Polytune outer casing is made of plastic. Once I put this inside my music bag with my other things, it cracked. Beside this, it is only good for quiet venues. I play at church and cannot use this with all the noise going on around.
1,Two small for my big fingers even after adjustment.
1,Item was not working when arrived as Brand New, the items have not been fixed, nor was I approved for a refund.
1,Lost the stand adapter and contacted Akg US parts center to get a replacement. I was told the stand adapter cost $30.		Which is insane. Piece of plastic piece is 41% of a new mic which includes the adapter.		AKG take note.		Update: Turns out AKG Does not offer the same stand adapter, instead they offer an accessory stand adapter which costs $30.
1,Bought 2  one power pack already quit. its not what I expected has a whole lot of season figures skulls hearts stars just not what I wanted
1,received wrong bag.
1,This strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good, also doesn't fit an instrument where there's no place to hook it .  I returned mine, as it just didn't fit well for my uke or mandolin.
1,I bought this, the 2nd input produces no sound which renders that input useless.	The fact that the full intent of this device is to provide 4 outputs, yet fails to do so.  Means the quality control is obviously not there.	So if u want 3 outputs for the price of 4, go ahead and buy this.
1,simple, not readily useful, and not even worth the effort to try to use it.  the information on it is very limited and still is difficult to find.
1,This is a foam / nylon bag. its a good dust cover, but doesn't offer much protection. I would recommend getting a hard case.
1,I probably received a bad one. Rumor is Wuhan's quality control sucks so it's kinda iffy if your going to get a good one unless you personally get to test some before you buy. Which is what I suggest you do. I've heard Wuhan 16" chinas that sound much better than the one I have. The one I have sounds pretty much just terrible, I try to avoid hitting it and will be switching it out for a better cymbal soon.		Try to avoid buying these online. Find them at a local music store and test them out to find a good one otherwise you more than likely going to be disappointed.
1,I kept these on for about a week and switched to dunlop heavy core. They don't handle down tuning very well and they have a odd metal (not the music style) sound to them.
1,My computer died, and so I could not put this onto my new computer because the company won't let me.  Waste of money.
1,It worked all of 2wks	then I got another one but with so-called 800 watts, and was pretty much the same junk. I sent it back as well.
1,This is a pretty awful synth. Yes, it's analog and has four voices, but each voice sounds very limited and just... not very good. There's very little in the way of options here to shape the sound. The price keeps dropping from $499 to $299 to $249 and yet nobody wants these. Check out the Korg Minilogue if you want a four-voice analog synth that you can have a ton of fun on, and that sounds really good.
1,Based on the reviews, I took a chance with two of these, and kept them in inventory until needed.  Too late to return, and too cheap to bother, anyway.  One introduced freaky, unnatural tones into the send, and that was bad enough.  On the other, the attenuation switch shorted out with full volume blasts of noise.  Just seriously bad.  But if I'd ordered three, the next one might have been great!
1,Nut was huge and not usable because it was already notched. Saddle was nice but needed cut and custom fit.
1,THIS IS AN ADDENDUM TO AN EARLIER REVIEW.........SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ANYTHING BUT A PYLE POWER AMP....TODAY ON MY 6TH GIG WITH LESS THAN 20 HOURS (AT ABOUT 2-3 HOURS AT A TIME) IT DIED!!!!!!I DJ ON THE SIDE AS A HOBBY AND THIS AMP MADE ME LOOK BAD......NEVER AGAIN..BUY A PEAVEY, CROWN, QSC OR ANYTHING BUT A PYLE.
1,Has some Hiss in it, which is unacceptable to me. Will be returning for some of Elite Cores Snakes which seem to be cheaper & higher quality. I'm using these as drop snakes not main snakes, however if they introduce issues, it provides me no benefit over running mic cables direct to the main snake head.		For a small bad/church etc it would probably work fine.
1,To a certain extent rating a pedal is like rating a color of artist's paint: this green doesn't work for me at this moment vs you'll never use neon orange in a good painting vs everyone needs titanium white paint to mix other colors with.		My test setup: American made Charvel super strat, 1987 Gibson Les Paul, Epiphone TV Special, Moog EP3 expression pedal, Mesa Boogie DC3 amp, Crate Amp, Gorilla amp, Motu to Apple computer through Mackie 2408 mixer to gold dot monitoring headphones. I also tried an SWR volume pedal that worked but didn't have the travel the Moog pedal gave from bass to treble.		Compared to a Bad Horsie wah this sounds terribly thin. That's quite an accomplishment since the Bad Horsie doesn't knock my socks off. The Bad Horsie has a huge return spring so you can't leave it cocked.		Compared to my Dunlop wah (with 5 position custom filter/boost knob) this has no scratchy potentiometer noise. Which is nice! But again, it's thinner sounding and doesn't have the range from bass to treble...It sort of "steps" from low to high instead of smoothly transitioning like a real wah pedal. The Bad Horsie wah does a weird envelope filter noise in the middle of its travel so every pedal has its weirdness.		I've been collecting pedals since the early 1980s (metal Boss pedals, metal DOD pedals, Big Muff Pi, Arion, etc.). I also have zillions of Motu computer filters and a rack full of pre-amps and cabinet emulators. I dislike the fuzz on this pedal, to be fair I'm more of a smooth distortion guy.		With the fuzz post you can't hear the wah (which is sort of normal, but it's like the wah goes away). Fuzz pre and you get the vacuum cleaner filled with bees sound.  Not unexpected but not pleasant. Muddy bass to ear ache tinny highs.		Fuzz pre into a distorted amp with wah used with Moog EP3 pedal and it starts to sound nice and full.		If you set the wah to talk and pre-bend notes before you hit the string and then let them release bend slowly you can do some great Peter Frampton "do you feel" Heil talkbox licks.		Easier to setup than a Hiel talkbox.	No scratchy Dunlop wah pots.	No Bad Horsie return spring.	Fuzz is not distortion, it's fuzz.	Tiny bass knob is great.	The bias button mimics a dying battery, sounds like a bit crusher/variac which you could use on its own, but the wah/talking wah is always on and thinning out your sound.		If you don't have a full time job (money) get this over a Hiel talkbox, unless you have specific words you want to sing. It's just like my Roland Ghia synth, but less useful.		With a LOT of fine tuning and an expression pedal you could almost get a Dunlop wah without the scratchy potentiometer.		Fuzz? Like any fuzz pedal you can spend years trying different things. To me, fuzz always sounds terrible unless you're playing with a band, then you can use it on a song. If you're a kid playing alone in your basement, you'll probably be happier with distortion.		A Bad Horsie and page Boss distortion pedal would let you get so many useable sounds so easily, but at twice the cost.		I just keep trying things to make it not sound grating to me. My Arion plasticy distortion pedal I got dialed in in seconds. Same with the Boss distortion and overdrive pedals, and the DOD fuzz, distortion and overdrive pedals.		The Big Muff Pi took a few minutes of fiddling...And I feel is close to this. If you're not in love with the big Muff Pi you'll hate this, but if you actually USE a pi you'll like this.		I'm sure I'll keep fiddling and find more things I like about it, but unlike the majority of the other pedals I have this is not plug and play. You'll probably go "ugh" unless you don't have "Real" wah pedals or "Real" fuzz pedals or a "real" bit crusher filter in a DAW recording setup. Then you just won't know any better.		A strat and some 1970s licks and you'll be in heaven.		This is probably the harshest review I've ever done (except and item that literally exploded and burst into flames). I'm an easy 5 star. I've been using Amazon since the  late 1990s (I'm a librarian). I Iistened to many players on YouTube auditioning this pedal: a microscopic bump on a knob makes a HUGE change in tone.		If you want a halfway decent approximation of a wah, talkbox, fuzz pre or fuzz post, bit crusher/variac, then this isn't a bad deal at one sixth the price, but at less than full sound.		Funny enough I like the fuzz better than the wah on this... But I've got a ton of better pedals that do each of these effects so much better. They cost more when you add them up though.		If you have an amp with distortion (or clean) tone you like and really need (but can't afford) fuzz, talking wah, bit crusher all at once and can't save up money fast enough then this might be for you. Eventually you'll spend money replacing each function of this pedal with reals pedals and then you'll only use this for the talkbox function. (if your band does Frampton or Aerosmith covers a lot).		I can see why a lot of people love the this pedal. It's like junk food out of a vending machine vs a sit-down restaurant. Tons of people love pork rinds, but have never tried Chateaubriand steaks. Both are great and make the world go 'round. This pedal is something they sell to teenagers who don't have anything to compare it to (nor the cash to buy it). YET. I'm still intrigued with the possibilities of this pedal! Please take this review with a grain of salt HOWEVER, THIS IS A PEDAL YOU NEED TO AUDITION IN PERSON. I HAVE A FEELING you'll love or hate it.		I'm going to plug my expression pedal back into  a Pitchfork octave pedal where it belongs.		PS I got an awesome Dire Straits "Money for nothing" tone that totally put a smile on my face with this thing. Lol!
1,I unpacked mine and 20 minutes later I packed it up for return.  The two cylinders at the base of the stand were out of alignment, so the stand rocks back and forth - like a table with one leg shorter than the other.  I tried this on several floor surfaces and at different angles. The misalignment is serious too, and not good for holding a cabinet with a loudly vibrating speaker or two.  I can see that the six previous reviewers like this product, so hopefully I was just unlucky enough to get the bad one of the bunch.  Nevertheless, you deserve to know and as for me, I am now going to shop locally for this item.
1,Sounds ok, durability really sucks...	Just buy when there's not Elixir or Earnie Ball available.
1,The difference between these and the $20 models is a very important feature. The spring pin on the strap lock allows the pin to wobble severely therefore making it feel very loose and cheaply made. Go for the extra $8 and get the better brands.
1,Seems sturdy but I don't like the adjustment mechanism. It doesn't offer enough adjustment settings.  One adjustment was too low, the next adjustment was too high.  I had to make a plywood spacer to get the height that I wanted.  I suggest looking at other stands.
1,Honestly look elsewhere. It's just not that good of a pedal. It's basically an on off switch. There is barely room in between. I guess. You might be able to adjust it, but just buy a slimer better volume pedal.
1,This 14" bag fits very tight and the inside lining seam came apart, most likely because it was sewn improperly. Disappointed to say the least. Had used the bag 3 times.
1,I've been using clear Worth strings on my baritone for a year but find they have too much side-to-side flexibility. I switched to Aquilas and have replaced two G strings in three weeks. (Which usually means buying whole sets of four because most shops don't have single baritone strings.) There were very visible wear marks on the G string all up the neck in places I don't play a lot. I just put on a set of Kamaka strings and it is too soon to report on them. They use different metal wrappings for the third and fourth strings (Silver and aluminum). If these fail quickly also, it's back to the Worths. They last forever. Keep tuned.
1,Pros: Doesn't drip. Fairly compact design, probably better for travel with a case than at home.		Cons: I don't like how far it spreads the strings to stay suspended (see photos). The product images on Amazon are clearly Photoshopped to show no string spreading at all. This is not the case. The material inside (more of a micro-fiber sponge than anything special) seems to lose it's moisture much quicker than advertised (they say you only have to fill it once a month).		I'll be looking for a better solution and manually humidifying the air in the meantime.
1,This is a great little unit. I love the fact that it has two 18 V ports as well as eight 9V ports. What puzzles me is why much bigger bricks don't even put out this much power? I don't pretend to know all the electrical answers, but I use this as a secondary supply under my board. Powertrain is the main one and is full (Fulldrive 2 at 18v), and this one powers the tuner at 9v, an EP Boost at (18v) , and a Fulltone OCD at 18v.		(Btw, running any pedal that can handle 18v is a great idea. Massive more clarity and headroom!)		I don't demand too much out of this unit, just those three pedals, and my only concern is the frailty of the adapter and the skinny wire running from the AC adapter into the input of the brick. When you compare that to the 10 or 12 gauge wire that runs to the Power Train brick or these other massive bricks, you have to wonder about the life expectancy.		So far, so good!		UPDATE: I wrote the first part of this review after having it for a few weeks. But here's what happened after using the unit for approximately four months:		As popular as this unit is, I would not buy one. Let me explain  I would not buy another one.  I had one that worked for a while, but then three or four of the channels gave out. One of them fried the inside of my $400 JHS Klon Klone. It was playing fine, and then wham! Sparks and a little smoke from the Brick output (one of the 9v ports) and a dead, expensive boutique pedal.		Also, for my power-hungry Strymon pedals, it was noisy. I know it was the Brick because I A-B'd the same pedals with a Voo Doo Lab supply, the Brick, and the big power supply from Pedal Train and all was quiet with those two and big noise with the Brick. And did I mention that it fried a $400 boutique JHS pedal that can't be replaced? I'm still upset about that.		The deal is this: if you have nice gear then go ahead and buy a nice power supply. If you only run a few pedals that aren't big time power hungry, then it's likely fine. But I was not abusive to my Brick, liked the size, and for my low end pedals it did ok until the ports started going out (and the aforementioned spark and smoky death to my favorite OD).  In the end, I lost a total of five ports, but more than that I lost my confidence and the ones that were left and in the entire unit as well as Dunlop as a whole.		I play several times a week and for the past 6 years at church. I finally went with a Voo Doo Labs Mondo as well as one of their Digital units, and have never had one problem with them. We're they expensive? Sure. But did I mention that by saving a few quid, this unit fried my sweet JHS Klon Klone, one that is no longer made and used ones cost 400-500 dollars?		If you can't afford a new high-quality power supply, then go to eBay or Reverb.com and buy one like the Mondo that's used but in good condition.		My $.02.
1,Worst. No No no.		It has a weird taste. When you use it on a smoke machine and smokes comes out. you'll get the taste on everyone's mouth around there.		Bought is for a photo shoot. Hated it.		I had to apologize with my clients for this nasty thing.
1,This speaker looks good, is small enough, but its performance is horrible:  it squeaks and screams loudly on nearly every setting; on the setting that it doesn't  sharply irritate, there is no volume.  I tried everything, but nothing worked. I sent it back.
1,Terrible. It didn't sync with my keyboard that I had at the time. Make sure you do your research and don't always go for the cheap one. Lesson learned.
1,As the title says; save your money and get an ACTUAL tube amp, like the Marshall DSL15C, which is lighter, and smaller, and the controls are up front, not stuck in back like the CR60C. If you want to match the weight and size of the CR60C, you have many options including Fender or Marshall.	While the Orange does have an OK sounding dirty channel, where gain control volume can be turned way down, that's about where it ends.	The amp is close to 45 Lbs. (DSL15C is 39.7), which is VERY HEAVY for a 1x12 solid state amp., and is wider than it has to be.	The controls are located at the top/back of the unit which is hard to get to if pushed up close to a wall for practice.	The Clean Channel offers NOTHING, and is as milk toast as it can get, which means the speaker is just OK.	I have a lot of new amps from Mesa, Fender (most of my amps), Roland, Marshall, Line 6, Vox, Etc., Etc., and this amp kinda falls	into a boutique-ish category that makes it above average for overdrive applications, and just OK for everything else.	I actually get much better overdrive, and clean out of my Champion 40, and Mesa V-twin Pre-Amp pedal, or the Marshall DSL15C.	To tell you the truth, I just don't understand why someone would want to pay this price for a 1x12 large and heavy wanna be tube amp.
1,Fantastic design on these things, but they simply do not block an adequate DB overall and are really uncomfortable too! I was surprised, since I've had a great experience with their HERE Active Listening earbuds. But like some other reviewers, my ears are ringing badly after using the DUBS ... and because it lets some amount of SOME frequencies through, they're ringing irregularly and everything sounds strange now. I feel awful.		It's hard to protect your ears and treat them to music as it should be heard. Aside from molded musicians plugs,the only thing I can fully recommend is Earasers so far. They're comfy and safer.
1,Doesn't work. Tried on 2 computers. Shows up in sound preferences, but input and output produce nothing. I've been working with sound card interfaces for computers for a little while, so yes, I made sure everything was enabled and turn up. This particular one I got sent, just didn't work.
1,For some reason, this one just doesn't hit the notes right.  It looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway.  I have tried it several times and it just doesn't tune right.  Then I recheck with my other brand and it's not even close.  Maybe I just got a bad one?  I like that this one shuts off automatically..but again, it's WAY off tune.	I did like the style, size and color.....but it doesn't work right so it's like running with a flat tire...
1,Update: Very happy with Pioneer Ddj Wego3, a toy that works more reliably than this "pro" device. For some reason Numark dropped the ball on the Lightning connection, available since iphone 5?!?!, with zero acknowledgement of a known problem, repeatedly complained about on their own forum. Maybe I just got a dud, but I'm definitely not the only one, and I'll stick with my reliable toy.		Original review:	I rarely leave 1 star reviews but Man, I really wanted this to work, and it's just not reliable enough. There is a known problem with these devices, when you use with a lightning adapter. There is some kind of static/ground issue that creates a horrible rattly distortion, I honestly thought I blew my speakers the first time I heard it. And of course the first time it acted up like this, it was at the first gig I was using it at, after I had tested it at home with no problems. I seriously thought I blew my Bose L1 model 2, but then luckily I noticed the same static coming through the headphones, whew. It was obviously just the controller device, which sucked too, but a lot less catastrophic then a blown speaker system. Luckily when I pulled the plug on it and tried again, the static was gone. I figured it might have been a one time thing, but did a Google search on it, and on the Numark forums, what do you know, many people with the same problem. Simply unacceptable for professional use with lightning devices, which is insane. Yes, you can usually make the static go away, but I can't risk that and waste time on this, sometimes it doesn't go away completely until you power it off and on two or three times, and I'm talking pulling the power plug, not exactly great for speakers.		If you have the old 30 pin connector iPad, apparently it doesn't make that problem happen, although I know my iPad 2 runs incredibly slow nowadays. This product is just outdated, lightning connectors have been out for years now, no reason Numark couldn't have fixed this.		Physical build quality is very nice, definitely looks professional which is nice, I'm a mobile wedding DJ (no clubs or anything) so I don't really do any scratching or anything but having something to Crossfade, loop, queue up to beat match, with outputs and built-in iPad charger is very nice. I'm returning this and going to go with the Pioneer DDJ we go 3, hopefully that works out. The pioneer definitely looks more like a toy, but gets great reviews and heck, if it's a reliable toy and can do everything I need, I'll take that any day over a pro lemon. The upside of the pioneer is that it's a lot smaller too, so it will take up less of my small table space, the downside is, it just flat out doesn't look as impressive, at least I don't think, I haven't received mine yet.  Clients want to think you're using the best equipment so looks are somewhat important, but I can't Jeopardize a gig for looks.
1,Flimsy feeling, but stores easily.
1,Returned. Pedal puts out a lot of static when plugged in even while of.
1,The board itself is okay. The bag is a bit cumbersome & feels a bit cheap like the handle is going to rip loose at any second when transporting the loaded board. My biggest problem is with the power supply. Specifically, how much noise it emits when the amp is on the high gain channel. The clean channel is fine but when you switch there is a very noticeable HUMMM from the power supply transformer. Ultimately, I blame myself. I read the description and didn't see anything about the power supply being regulated. I have a background in radio communications and know that an unregulated power supply will emit a hum if used with audio equipment. Especially if you are powering several things with it. Oh well, live and learn!
1,I was curious about trying these out since I have been using D'addario strings for around 8 years.	One of my strings broke in the middle as I was putting these on! I can't understand how it would break in the middle of the string without even having really been tuned or tightened yet. I'm disappointed. Going to see if I can get a spare sent to me or something as the rest of the strings do sound well.
1,Spend an extra 10 dollars and buy a Nady microphone for 39. This is a hunk of junk. To even get a clear signal from the microphone you practically have to press your lips on the microphone. The gain had to be almost fully turned up to hear myself speaking out of a set of EV powered speakers. I would not recommend. this is a toy. If you want a decent wireless microphone I recommend looking at a NADY system there are about 40 dollars and the range is good and you don't hear static.
1,Didn't seem to do much. The enhance knob. Is more like a noise knob. Always keep it zero. Not worth the price but I'm gonna keep it because it does help a little. Keep the threshold and ratio below 9 o'clock for best results. Seems to work well with slap bass. But I don't slap. Slap is whack.
1,the nuts are plastic
1,I don't know what the problem is with these strings.  I've been playing for 22 years and have always used Ernie Ball's.  This is the first time I'm trying 'coated' strings due to a suspected nickel allergy.  I bought 2 packs for my Stratocaster.  The high E string from BOTH packs SNAPPED at the head on the very first bend?? Threw on another set of EB's, the same exact way I have always installed my strings, and no problems.  I would think if there's a bad batch out there then Amazon would pull them from inventory.  Very disappointed.
1,nunca llegaron a mis manos
1,The Dean acoustic bass I bought barely fits in this thing... It's almost busting at the seams but other than that, it ain't bad.
1,bad solder joints inside.  poor frequency response on this microphone.
1,crap
1,Amazing product  for the price the only bad thing they three mic stands and in the picture I see four 2 small ones and 2 big ones. I got two small ones  and one big one. Who ever mess up thanks a lot guy GOOD JOB
1,very bad
1,Tuner works great. Both by vibration and mic.	Only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak. Mine broke off... not even a year old.
1,I opened the box and it looked as if someone had already used it. The pick guard is dirty and the protective plastic was half removed. This is not the usual quality I've gotten from MusicLily which was a surprise. I'm deciding if I send it back or not
1,I got the large size...my hands are not all that big and these are really...really tight and small.
1,Poor construction, poor finish, poor sound. I hate to say it but this is a really weak instrument.  Had to return mine after it came in really bad shape with the strap pin broken, the paint job ruined, paint bubbles near the cutaways and the worst set up I have witnessed from a mailed instrument.. You always expect to set it up a bit when you receive something through mail but this was beyond that level... The electronics are really quiet in the worst way, meaning the volume is very weak when compared to other budget instruments.  The tone is sort of flat... Not much of a character or a deepness... I wouldn't recommend this instrument net to any serious musician or aspiring musician, this bass is sort of a toy, and a very cheaply made one, if I may add. Historically bad...
1,Total piece of trash. Do not buy. It was not even good enough as a toy! It was not in tune! It was supposed to come with instructions. Mine didn't. It came in a crushed box.  Looked like I got a used piece of junk someone had returned!! The only reason I didn't return it was that it was cheap!	I guess you can't expect much for $3.
1,If you are buying this pedal to run into a small solid state amp in your practice room, you will be disappointed. If you put it in front of your Marshall JVM, you will be disappointed. If you run it into the front of a marshall non master volume amp, you will be thrilled. I play okay, bur couldn't get it to sound like the clips online. I will be sending it back.
1,This is a terrible guitar! As soon as I started playing it- buzzing everywhere, the frets were unleveled/uneven, intonation problems, 15th-21st frets totally unplayable! Didn't sound good. A dud. Also not a true double cutaway.
1,It's just a cheap made thing, if you want to get a good capo go at Kyser.  I noticed right off the bat that it didn't have a very strong clamp either
1,All it is is a tip cleaner for cutting rorch. Much cheaper at welding supply store.
1,Absolute garbage. I have been playing harp for nearly 25 years and bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer. Several stuck reeds straight out of the box. Unplayable. I wasn't expecting a pro-level harp but this is ridiculous. I haven't been thrilled with my last two Special 20's either. You have lost me as a customer for life, Hohner. Back to Lee Oskar for me. Save your money. Junk.
1,Product arrived looking like it might have been used. Putty dry and would not stick. Fell off repeatedly. Cable is low quality. Sound was just ok no matter were you put it on the instrument. Can not recommend it at all.
1,This thing is a waste of money.  I tried it in several different applications and not only did it never make a hum go away but every single time it introduced a high frequency hum that is not present without the PHE400 in line.	Do not buy it.  It's a waste of money.
1,Kind of a complicated piece of ribbon - hard to get it set up right.  Once you do - and it's complicated every time - then it works okay.
1,The screw holding the winder kept falling out.  A little superglue and it works ok.  It should work out of the box though.
1,Update: Nope. I am a big fan of other DR strings, mainly low riders. These are just not worth it. The grounding issue renders them useless without some kind of wire harness to ground them to your body, which I have done, and it works, but is a pain in the rear. Do you want to tie and untie a wire from your wrist every time you put the bass down? I don't. The older coating from 10 years back or so did not have this issue. And even when plugged into my high end gear, I'll still get an electric pop or 2 if I don't run a wire ground, rendering tracks I record useless, I prefer to play tracks all the way thru with no punch ins. Beyond that, the tone and feel just isn't the same as the old coated strings. Frankly, these suck for passive basses that require a body contact ground. 2 stars for staying in tune like DR's always do for me, but I'm going back to low riders. Might try nickel low riders for kicks.		Original review: Hmm. I am a big fan of DR strings but I'm not digging these so far. I used to use the peacock blue coated strings many years ago, I really liked them, the coating seemed smoother and more comfortable on fretting fingers, and I don't recall the "non grounding" issue with those older strings. This coating does prevent your fingers from fully grounding the bass (the hum does get cut a little, not all the way), which is an issue on the cheaper practice amps I have around the house and studio. I haven't used it for recording yet but through my DAW interface I don't notice much hum. If I had tape wound strings that have the same issue, we will see how that works out.	I believe the older coated strings were also based on low riders, where as these are based on highbeams. Maybe I just like the feel of low riders better. Anyway, I'm surprised at how rough they feel on the fretting hand even with the coating. Not a big deal, but surprising. The sound is still bright and new after a couple weeks, so that's nice, the coating does seem to keep the strings sounding fresh longer, although I do like a more broken-in sound overall. I don't play a ton of bass so I assume if I played it more they would break-in, and as any experienced recorder knows, it's easy to dial out brightness, but it's tough to add it back in if you want to it, so this isn't really a big problem.	The jury still out for me, at this point I'm lukewarm, if I change either way I will update my review.
1,This is really cheap and light. I find it very odd that this is a recommended bundle for the microphone I purchased. The microphone purchased was the MXL 770 Cardioid Condenser Microphone which only weighs 1 pound, but this stand can not hold it without tipping over. And NO I am not extending the boom at all and it can't hold this mic. The counter weight on the boom is completely worthless.
1,I finally gave up and took these stupid things off my drums.  They do reduce the ring slightly, but using two of them on a snare barely achieved anything.  I think it would take four, or maybe eight, and at that point you just need to plop some moon gel on the thing, change your heads, or change your tuning.
1,I tried Legere for a bit.  Not long.  I found two big problems with them:	1.  The Legere is a lot stiffer than the cane of the same size.  They may have fixed this since I last played on them, but I used to play on Mitchell Laurie 4 (sometimes 4.5) cane reeds and I couldn't get a single peep from a Legere 4 because it was too stiff.  I had to drop to a Legere 3.	2.  This is solid plastic so it does not vibrate as well as the cane reeds.  This means that I have to blow harder to get the same volume level.  It also means that the notes can sound somewhat muddled or stifled... particularly after 45 minutes of playing when there is quite a bit of spit clinging to the reed.  These reeds are meant to be played WHILE TOTALLY DRY.  As soon as any moisture (like spit) hits it, the sound quality goes down.		I will say that I like Legere slightly better than the Plasticover reeds; those are just normal cane reeds with a plastic coating so they have even more problems than regular cane reeds in my opinion.  However, if you want a really great reed that will last a long time, give you awesome musical quality, and has a sound similar to (but crisper than) regular cane, try Fibracell instead of Legere.
1,i would have given this thing 5 stars but i barely used it and it just stopped working one day. i tried to call the company about it and they didn't want to send me a replacement. When it worked it was an amazing product, but because of poor customer service I'm going to have to give them a bad rating.
1,It keeps turing off and on repeatedly. I plugged it into every port and reinstalled the drives like 6 times over the course of 2 days. I have  looked on forums and haven't found a reason why it does this. My other interface works, but I wanted this one because of the phantom power and auto sense. Im really disappointed that its not working.. and yes the drivers were the correct one for my computer.
1,Bought for guitar set ups. Really have to fiddle with it on thin necks for it to grab properly. Better suited for thick neck guitars.
1,I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the "Lite"). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.		I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.		My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the "Lite".
1,Good construction for the price. The pegs are wider than stock so you will need to adjust your neck to fit them (drill). I'd honestly spend the money on a better quality peg that you know fits. These really aren't worth the bother unless they fit perfect. Also they shipped in ziplock bags. I just talked myself down to 2 stars instead of 3.
1,ok
1,Not impressed. I was hoping to go digital on my fx pedals.  I can barely get this to work.
1,More for wall decorations than playing, Electronics didn't work. Very high string action.
1,I work in a music studio. No need to explain why the company that makes these should know better than to shoot two huge holes in this item as a packaging method. A plastic bag would be fine as this hard foam wouldn't be damaged in the shipping process. Also this product is not "ONE SIZE FITS ALL" by a long shot. Measure your guitar hole before ordering and fill the holes with rubber cement.
1,I cannot move the adjustment piece...... takes more muscles than I have
1,One connector is a few millimeters too long, meaning the cable needs to be slid out slightly in the jack in order to get a connection. Tweed doesn't make up for poor functionality.
1,Shame on Gibson, I had to get some adjustments, I bought this for a friends birthday gift and boy, was I shocked, even the repairman said "this couldn't be a GIBSON". I was so embarrassed, I thought I was getting a good deal when I saw  "byGIBSON " next to Maestro, but I've truly found out the meaning of  "looks are deceiving". Sounds aren't !
1,The spring mechanism on one of the locks was frozen solid, i.e., would not pull back, thereby rendering the item useless
1,This tuner didn't last one (1) year. Save your money and buy serious accessories. I bought a donner power supply and it took a dump within six (6) months .They offered me $5 and the best of luck (on an @ $40 expenditure).
1,Both of the bottom pieces broke within the first few times I played on them, definitely very weak plastic. Disheartening to see my expensive cymbal sitting at the bottom of the metal cymbal arm because these broke.  Should have stayed with Tama, but wanted to give these a try. Never again!
1,winder keeps coming unscrewed.  Doesn't fit tuners very well on Squier strat, keeps coming of while winding.  Cutters work well.
1,Microphone cable is build very cheaply. The cord is thin and fragile.  You are better off going to Guitar Center and actually seeing what you are buying.
1,In the beginning, It was okay, but now it doesn't read the correct string when tuning- e.g. when I tune the B string, it will read or tune to A or D.
1,too wide to fit the scroll of an F style mandolin...and too thick and stiff to be left on the mando when stored in the case....
1,I waited a long time for this to ship from China, so if you need it quick, forget it. It works OK, but the quality is not all that. Looks used brand new. Can't speak to the longevity.
1,Looks cool but does not work any better than the built in Mic on my macbook pro, did some voice over comparison recording with both and they sounded about the same. sent it back
1,First, I did not get the blue one that I ordered. Second the low E was not audiable when playing electricly. Now I have to try and sell it as a purely accoustic bass. Already replaced with a Taylor.
1,Well you have to be careful with the placement of this.  After buying it, I felt I could do without easily enough....
1,One light was out when it arrived--DOA. I get concerned when for 90 dollars a company can't make a plate of steel with two lamps. Or, another way to look at it is that the unfortunate Chinese worker who assembled it never took the time to simply plug it in to see if it worked. I returned it.
1,It didn't meet my expectations as I don't use it anymore.  Created more noise than it was supposed to clean up. I tried all different settings and it did not meet my expectations.
1,Maybe I'll be able to raise my review later, but for now It is a completely useless product. I picked one up because it's a recommended add-on for the LEAGY L-58 mic, but there's no way out of the box to get it to hold that mic. Or any mic bigger than your standard lead singer dynamic mic.		Looking back through the reviews, it looks like sometime around February they changed the product and got rid of the adapter that would let you fit another shock mount on here. Amazon needs to update what products this is recommended to go with then. I've liked most other NEEWER products I've bought, but this one is a sham so far.		Besides all that: In general it feels kind of cheap and doesn't fasten amazingly well to my desk, but it'd be passable if I could fit my mic onto it. I'm glad I only bought the one... I have two mics, so if it worked I was going to grab another one. I'm debating now sending it back or seeing if I can find another use for it.
1,At first i thought it was aright but then I stated to examine it more, and when I press my high e string on first fret its making a twinging sound because the string is rubbing on the second fret, fixable but im pretty pissed that it came this way and also only one button to put a guitar strap on it, so its alright for the price I guess...
1,Works flawlessly with FL Studio. I love this little thing. From the pads to the keys. Simple and gets the job done. Only bad part is, the cord ripped and I had to tape it together. The wires are showing and it works, but keeps unplugging. The cord could be made more sturdier. It also comes with the Arturia sound VST, which is a library of hundreds of sounds.		EDIT: After ONE year, the port that you plug the piece into, has broken. It pushes in, when I plug in the cable, and only works when I'm pulling it out, AKA, it DOESN'T work. The cable is brand new as well. Money gone to waste. You know when they say "What you pay is what you get"? This is one of those instances.		I contacted Arturia. First a lady asks for my info via email. I give it to her. Then another person asks for the same info. I give it to them. So since the warranty is up, I'll have to pay for repairs. I wait for a reply. One week goes by. Two. Then three. Now I send another email asking "ARE YOU GOING TO REPLY AT ANY POINT OR NO". They reply "You didn't give us your full address". ARE YOU SERIOUS? I send it back, no reply AGAIN.		SAVE YOUR MONEY. Support is a joke, and so is this piece of trash Midi.		I bought an Alesis Vi25. Worth the $200.
1,I got this gig bag for an ibanez rg. The gig bag does not fit any standard size electric guitar, not the ibanez, not a strat, not my schecter hellraiser. Nothing. It also came with some broken zippers. The gig bag itself looks to be of fair quality but it is completely useless to me as it is about 6 inches too small to fit a standard electric guitar. I could have gotten a faulty unit. My order with GO-DPS was late, packaging was delivered to the wrong address and it came broken. Selle GO-DPS said they would help me if I removed my feedback but as soon as I did it they disappeared. I would recomend purchasing a better bag at musiciansfriend or any other seller in amazon that's not GO-DPS.
1,I just don't like it. It's cheaply made with a terrible sound.
1,Tip's think clear plastic coating was coming off.	Also doesn't fit baby Taylor, but I did cut it to fit.	This pic guard is not a real turtle design, it's printed on the bottom layer and a slab of clear plastic is on top.
1,pure garbage then it broke
1,I used this thing for one live show and I look down to find black scuff mark all over my guitar!!!!  I guess from where my pick was making contact with it......  I will never use it again
1,WE bought it while we were in the USA -- once back in Australia when we started to use it we found it was faulty -- apart from having some sort of coating over the whole thing( Like it had never been completely finished in manufacture) we find the battery goes flat quickly whether it is turned off or  not -- we have to take the battery out after we use it to preserve the batteries -- we issued a complaint but have had no helpful response.	Piece of junk. Bad service.
1,This is a well made microphone, heavy, about 6" long and very professional looking. (So professional that it looks a little funny using it to take smartphone videos, but... why not? Kind of ups the "smartphone game", at least that's what I was hoping.) The cable between the mic and the smartphone is about 6' long, about the right length as you might even want someone else to hold the microphone a ttime.		Things I like? I really like the quality of the construction--as good as my $200 microphone. I also really like that it is an EXR mic--fits on my near-professional Panasonic digicam perfectly (although it cautions that it is "only for mobile devices". I've never seen a mobile device that allowed for an EXR cable, but they must be out there). In addition, the EXR has an adapter for the built in mic jack in smartphones and tablets--easy to put on, fits perfectly and is obviously the.way most people will be using it.		It comes with an attachment that you can use with a mic stand. It also comes with a small black vinyl carrying case--about 6" long--fits the microphone but if you want your mic jack, you have to take it off before storing them together in it. It's compact and convenient.		The mic jack is standard size-- 3.5 mm (1/8) jack, so it fits into pretty much all mobile devices. Mine had no problem fitting into a phone and two tablets, a laptop, etc. (Again, there is an important warning not to use it with a standard XLR cable--it is only for mobile devices so I'm not sure why it is made for an EXR cable to begin with.)		The manufacturer claims that it has both omni and cardioid patterns--so it can be directional for a speaker or general noise recording for an entire room, for example. I was unable to accomplish this change no matter what I tried.  (The page of directions is only about the obvious things--connecting the audio jack adapter, nothing technical or to help with troubleshooting.)  The recessed switch was hard to reach and didn't seem to do anything, despite the claim that it switched between omni and cardioid settings and also raised or lower the gain. None of that worked, as far as I could see.		When you use the mic jack you are often taking up the same jack that your headphones would have used--and I really really like that this has a split cable with its own jack that lets you plug your headphones in while using the microphone. That's a great feature.		If only it worked well. :(  It did not work at all with my Android smartphone (BLU) but did work after I downloaded this app for the Kindle Fire. It definitely amplified the sound and improved vocal quality considerably. But the problem was that no matter what I did (and you can adjust it by sticking something into the Hi/Lo switch) the background sound was like you were at the ocean. Right at the shore a constant and loud "Whoosh".  If I find a solution, I'll reevaluate this and post what it is. But it's a plug and play and even after tinkering with the few options available--I'm not optimistic.  .
1,It's okay. Had it for a few days and returned it. At low volumes it's good. At higher volumes that I prefer it gives me a horribly traumatizing screeching sound...like someone stabbing me in the eardrums...usually when I hit a string hard. I'm not playing crazy loud, but just loud enough to really feel the music. Buying headphone/amp combo from a different manufacturer as I've lost a bit of confidence in Vox based on my experience the past couple days with this guy.
1,Pretty sturdy, takes a little time to adjust, not very tall, but for the price you cant ask much		Update, I had 4 stars before...so, info says holds 370 lbs...NO IT DOESN'T...	I was just watching a trailer on my computer, and my girl sat on my lap... I am 145 lbs, she is 125 lbs, that's a total of 270...needless to say we both ended up on the floor after 1 min and 20 seconds...awesome, NOT! ...funny though
1,I am not happy with this at all!! Here is why		1- The product is almost like a toy fell product and they don't give you much instructions on how to place a 9volt battery.	2- it doesn't sound very good at all I can see why it was 25$!!		The only good thing about this was how fast it was shipped to me!! I will be sending this back and using that money towards a Boss Pedal!!!
1,flimsy and too short
1,CHINCY.
1,Complete garbage. What little it did little to enhance the guitar sound was completely drowned out by the amount of noise it added to the signal. Returned it.
1,I have had this for 4 months and honestly I would rather eat hot coals than try to use it anymore! I used it solid for about a week (hour a night) and ended up with the worlds worse case of numb bum! I switched to a solid wood dining chair which was a million times better (with no padding). Now I'm 6'2" and 200lbs, so maybe it would be OK for a child or someone who weighs 150lbs or less. Plus I found it to be too high without enough holes to lower it. So I had to take the pin out completely and let it just drop...	I have now ordered a big throne for about five times the money of this stool and if someone told me it would cost me my soul i'd give it to them!	Maybe a bit on the extreme side but it really is torture to sit on this stool and attempt to drum, on top of that I was attempting to improve my double bass technique which made it a lot worse...
1,I purchased this device because it's advertised as a USB class-compliant audio interface.  Focusrite completely fails to mention that there's no way to put it into class-compliant mode on Windows.		I've read horror stories about Focusrite's windows divers so I had no intention of installing them.  If I had known any of this I might have purchased a different interface.		Shame on you, Focusrite.  This is definitely consumer complaint territory.
1,Thought I would give coated strings a try, and to be honest, i'm not a fan. Tone quality was good, but it was extremely difficult to play without vibration coming from the frets. I stuck it out for a couple of weeks, but I ended up switching to the D'Addario phosphor bronze, and I will NEVER switch back. Uncoated strings play much better. I know there are some people out there who swear by these coated strings...but I honestly don't see why.
1,Junk. Didn't work at all.
1,Impressive sound for a small, inexpensive effect. Except for the fact that mine breaks into loud static after a couple of minutes of playing. I'll be returning it under warranty and will report back on how cooperative they are.		Update: It was impossible to talk to the seller about my defective product. Amazon agreed to allow me to return it "just this once", given the circumstances. That's just crazy given the device is supposed to have a 6 month warranty. How is Amazon doing me a "favor" by taking back a defective device that's still under warranty? So just beware, in my experience they seem failure-prone and then you have to jump through hoops to get your money back, or at least be told to be grateful that Amazon is helping you out "just this once". Too bad, since I really liked this little gadget when it worked. I would give it five stars if it didn't fail on me. I'm hesitant to buy another one. Maybe try a pocket pod at a much higher price?		Update: Decided to buy an identical replacement unit. I hope that was just a bad unit and that the new one lasts. Amazon had the gall to deduct a restocking fee from my refund on a defective item.
1,Plastic case. Once I made some adjustments to the 1/4inch plug-ins in the box, it would keep them from falling out.(They would not lock in on their own as it was received.  Behringer is a low end line, and this should have been anticipated.  I'll look to better quality construction in future purchases.
1,Too Short!  I had to rob another strap with a longer tailpiece strip.  I am a large Man, but c'mon.  Would 3" of skinny leather cost that much?
1,These are not tall enough to use standing up, unless you are a child.  They are also very lightweight.  I have Shure 57s on them and they tend to want to fall over all the time.  While I think they might be ok for using them for amp mics, they aren't very good for singing or whatever else.  They're just too cheap and light.  I am returning them.
1,This mic was not good at all for podcasting or broadcasting. It picked up ever sound from my typing on the keyboard to background noise.
1,but hopefully this might help someone, just received this thing.		not sure if it is the lightning cable or compatibility problem, but he sonic port vx is not being recognized by my ipad pro,, also tested it on an iphone 5s with same outcome (wishful thinking, because both are same version of iOS).		i get absolutely nothing and no interaction with the ipad, as if it is dead,, i just get this faint intermittent flash of the red sound clipping light.		however, on windows, the port is recognized and mic volume shows as being monitored,,, didn't record yet but obliviously there is sound being recognized by windows and levels shown on recording device list.		didn't buy it for this reason... such a disappointment
1,Trash, don't buy this!	I bought this twice, can't get it to work.		It's better to buy a soundcard with Midi
1,With no input plugged into amplifier, there is a horrible hum when plugged into wall outlet (multiple adapters tried), but even has a diminished hum using battery power only.  Plugging in an input source doesn't change the hum.  I even tried wrapping the whole amplifier in aluminum foil as an rf shield and that didn't change the hum.  The face plate is conductive, so when you touch it the hum intensity is maximum.  Overall, it does amplify, but the quality is so poor that it is unusable.  A real let down considering the Fender name.
1,I bought this GLS Mic due to the rumor of "Shure SM58-clone", and had quite high expectations. However, it is not a Shure SM58.		I agree with some reviews that it's a very good Mic at $30 price point (good build quality as well, although I only had it for 1 week). But I strongly disagree with the comments that it records as high quality sound as the Shure SM58. It cannot handle mid-to-high volume at all. The sound is very bright comparing to the Shure SM58. And this unit is much easier to catch "echo-sounds" than the Shure SM58.		It might not be fair to give a 2 stars to this GLS ES-58 if the rating is entirely based on its performance (4 stars @ $30, and 3 stars @ $50). But given all the advertising of "Shure SM58-clone", I'd deduct some points to send the right message: This is far from a Shure SM58.
1,After less than 20 hours of gentle use, the plastic bar that attaches the strap broke - causing my bass to fall and break a tuning peg.  No abuse or aggressive play.  Cheap plastic and poor mechanical design appears to be at fault.
1,wtf could also stand for "wasted the funds". What a waste of time and money. DOn't fit traditional stands. Don't know how such a super giant like Gibraletr could make a non-universal product. And it's kinda overpriced. There's more plastic in my kids happy meal toys. hmmm...
1,This mic worked for 2 years then just DIED! It was never dropped or mishandled in anyway. It was kept in the case when not in use. What a piece of JUNK! Save your money! If I could give it ZERO stars I would.
1,I thought I could plug in my headphones and use the metronome but NOPE.  The tuner works like any other tuner.  The metronome has diffrent settings but can't hear them cuz I can't plug in my headphones.  It's kind of hard to hear over live drums.
1,Most of these things didn't work where i live
1,It had a bunch of stuff I have no use for, all the publications and lesson offers, etc. The headphones were okay for cheap phones, though I don't use them. The sustain pedal quit working the very first day and I had to buy a new pedal. The only thing of value to me in the package was the cord to connect the piano to an electric source.
1,The expression/sustain pedal is shockingly tiny! The headphones have scratchy phone ear pads and are terrible. Lots of offers for online tutorial programs which you may or may not be interested in.		My suggestion is to avoid buying this, even if it comes with a bundle. Instead, buy a power supply (it is possible to buy some Yamaha keyboards with the power supply included in the box, but make sure the listing actually says the power supply is included. For most Yamaha keyboards, you will need to buy the power supply separately. Stupid move, Yamaha).		Also, buy a full size sustain pedal, as you will likely lose the tiny one contained in the little survival kit box, because the pedal is so small. Either that or you will crush it.
1,It did not fit as expected on Meinel Bongos. That being said it was only the 6.75" head that did not fit so I can't really review it as it pulled out of the rim. If it did fit I imagine it would sound fantastic. I love the sound of the Aspire heads.  I also bought the 8" and it fit well and sounds great.
1,One mushy tone, totally unaffected by the settings. Plus the sound kicked off 10 minutes after I got it. Some short within. I had to return it for credit.
1,11/28/2016 - I am modifying my review, below is my original review from earlier in the year.	---	Don't waste your time, one star. This is a nice little unit, but Behringer obviously has a problem on their hands with this unit. My first one developed a crackling sound in the monitors after about a month or two of use. Not wanting to be out of recording while waiting for an RMA, I just bought another. These things are pretty cheap. Sure enough, after about a month or two, my replacement started doing the same thing. For the most part it isn't in the recordings, but sometimes it does. I don't know what is wrong with these things, but they need to figure it out. Now I get to be out of recording because I am 0 for 2 in the quality department on this unit. I'd look elsewhere.		Original review:	---	I was really torn between this one and the focusrite one, but since this is like a third to half the price, I went with this one. I just wasn't sure if I'd stick with it. It turns out this is a pretty neat little unit.		My recordings don't sound like a studio recording, obviously. I don't know if that's because this is a consumer unit or if it's mic related. But it works well for songwriting purposes and making demos. That said, the first unit I had, the monitor jack on the front got very crackly after only a few months of use. It didn't affect the recordings at all, but it's hard to hear what you're doing with a lot of noise added in. Given the relatively low price point and not wanting to be out of commission on recording while I wait for Behringer to send me a new one, I just bought another.		This works better when you install the ASIO4ALL drivers, which wasn't very clear to a newie like me, it takes some messing around to get it set up right.		The only thing I wish this had different was two XLR inputs and preamps instead of one plus 1/4 instrument jack. That would allow me to record with both a condenser and dynamic mic to get the kind of sound I want. But overall, it's a decent entry-level into home recording.
1,I only used this thing for swell guitar attacks a handful of times before it developed dead/scratchy spots in the sweeping range. Also, it *does* color your guitar sound some. This piece of garbage is made in China and will not last. Sure, it costs less than half of what the competitors do but if this wears out in under a dozen uses, it's not really that great of a deal- is it?
1,FYI, the collet on these stands is the ring thing that you rotate to tighten up the boom extension. Unfortunately, is it cheap plastic and arrived broken.
1,did not work with my Martin OM28. The strings were muted no matter how hard I closed. Maybe the radius was off or something. I sent it back. Seems nicely made, but heavy
1,The one I received did not have the pick pocket on it so I think it may have been couterfeit. Yet the strap does not have the pick pocket, nor the typical planet waves emblem on the end, it is padded and works well.  Make sure you use Straplocks to not lose your valuable bass!
1,Worthless pos. Does NOT work on BOSS products!		I have 5 BOSS pedals Ive collected over the years (TU2, 2 distortion pedals, Phaser, Chorus), and it doesn't work on any of them.	I have a Wampler, and a Dunlop too, and no dice. I'd also like to add, this looks like it was used before, or was a return that I ended up with.		This is a 1A 9volt power supply -pin (or its supposed to be).
1,Save yourself a bunch of money and get a cut off from the scrap yard.	I am a bit embarrassed that I spent over $11.00 on this hunk of metal.	While it will do the job, any straight piece of square metal (solid or tube)	will do the job.
1,I bought these and tried in my nylon string classical and they stuck okay but sound had problems so I pulled them and went with another product, which I reviewed also.  For the low price it was worth trying at least.  These generated noise artifacts and I think having 3 instead of 1 requires absolute perfection in placement which I was not willing to keep experimenting once the other brand worked out and is great.  Your results may vary.  Not sure what to do with this now but maybe I'll build some weird thing to generate noise.
1,Out of the box, the built of both the microphone and the receiver look quite good for the price.		After plugging in, I heard a clear sound and was happy.  However, as I walked a few steps away from the receiver, my voice began to cut out intermittently.  I looked at the RF indicator light and saw it flickering as I moved.  If I went over 25', it became worse.  It claims 200' range, but I couldn't get that far.  All I want is 50' range.  But, the major problem is you can't walk and talk with this mic even within 25'.		I tested in a church, but this mic is said made for DJ's.  A DJ sometimes has to take the mic to the floor and talk with the bride or groom. In that case this mic won't work.  You might be able to use this mic for stationary situation, but not for walking around.		The system is basic.  There's no facility for me to tweak or fine-tune it.
1,This review is for the "YMC New Replacement Maple Neck Maple Fingerboard for ST Strat Electric Guitar" purchased through "Simbas deals". Purchased this to replace a severely backbowed neck I was trying to use for a build. This neck is definitely not ready to slap on out of the box, but I don't believe that's the intention. The neck was dead straight when I pulled it out of the box (good). It's a very light maple color with a maple fretboard. It does have a light satin type finish on it, but it felt gritty and chalky. I hit it for a few minutes with a 220 grit sanding sponge and it smoothed things out nicely. The fret ends are a bit sharp, but I've felt worse on new Fenders. Nothing a few minutes with a fret file won't resolve. The nut was useless. Glued in but stuck out on both sides and was way too high. The nut popped off easily and I popped a Tusq nut that I had sitting around. It fit perfectly without any modification and holds snug in the slot without glue The truss rod functions properly and I was able to dial in good action with it. The end of the fretboard that sticks out over the body was cut unevenly. Not a huge deal but I may file it straight.		NOTE: The neck I received did NOT have a standard strat neck heel. It had a Telecaster neck heel. This was OK for me since I was putting this on a Telecaster, but anybody wanting to put this on a strat will need to do some modification to the neck heel. If I purchased this for a strat, I would send it back. Not worth the time or effort to have to reshape the heel. This is the reason for the 2 star review. The product is NOT as described. It works for me, but others hoping to put it on a strat will be disappointed.
1,junk fall apart in your hand
1,You only get the pickups, and not the pots.  This put me in a bind, as I was building a guitar for somebody's Christmas gift and I had to scramble to find parts locally.		They sound great, and I might even like them better than my lace hot golds.
1,Got this for Christmas and had to send it back. The cover plate for the adjustment rod had rough edges. I took the mandolin to a professional luthier who discovered why the plate was odd. There were 4 holes where the should have been only 2. The odd plate was made oversized to cover someone's manufacturing mistake. There was also a missing head on what I assume was 1 of the original 2 screws. The remainder of the sheared off screw was not removed by the manufacturer and actually blocked access to the adjustment rod. How utterly disappointed I am in the product I received.
1,Falling apart after very little use. Bought it because I thought mienl was decent brand. I was wrong. Its "pressed" together. Not smart for a percussion instrument. Also sounds very plasticy. Save yourself and look elswhere
1,Built well but didn't process the highs to my taste no matter how I set it. Fizzy. You'd be better off with a redbox or if you're up for it get an epsi.
1,I ordered two of these rack drawers.  When the first came in dented on the front of the drawer, I sent it back for a replacement.  The second drawer came in with the exact damage on its front.  Both times there was no damage to the shipping boxes.  This damage occurred in the factory and boxed up that way.  It is as though this factory has a disgruntled employee. Thank you Amazon for easy returns and refunds.  The drawer looked like it would have served my purpose though had it not been damaged.
1,The knobs came tarnished and didn't clean up very well.
1,It does its job, however I don't like the fact that you can't get the color of wood you want. I now have all ebony wood in my house and the guitar holder outlier. I actually asked the buyer for the darker wood version.
1,I purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my Roland GR55 (which has a flawless basic looper built in, but only 20 seconds record and no undo). I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along.		The factory battery lasted about 1 hour. The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes. I started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9.10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty. The lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc. etc.)		The first time I used the JamMan XT (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.		I am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so I know it was not my poor technique. The main problem was that it didn't matter how hard I tried (even if I did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start. This makes the unit useless.		Also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.	The potential for damage here is very high. Also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board. To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read INEVITABLE) damage.		I have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.		It's going back to the store where I purchased it.
1,only lasted 2 weeks then did not start up
1,Hardware installation is as expected.  A little difficult but manageable.	Software installation is a mess, poorly documented, and poorly written.	Fishman has you driving from SF to LA via China.	They tell you to install everything, but only the Fishman software install is essential.	If you setup the hardware as described and plug the wireless USB into a usb port,	the pickup will work with Reason or other popular midi diven software.	The software comes with Triple Play (Fishman), SampleTank, Komplete, Notion, and Studio One.	All of these programs were written by folks with very little knowledge of how to write a user interface.	The screens are generally sloppy, not intuitive, and some (like SampleTank) do not work at all (for me).	This is a product where Fishman tells you it is great and hopes you believe it!	I think the product is heading in the right direction, but has a long way to go.	I own a Roland GR-55.  The GR-55 has much less latency and is much more mature and intuitive.	I bought the Fishman TriplePlay because the tracking/latency is suppose to be better.	Supposedly, you can bend strings with the TriplePlay and it will track (not!).	Latency is worse than the GR-55 and bending does not work at all.	I will keep the TriplePlay as my buddies like to play with it as a novelty	and maybe someday, Fishman will fix it's shortcomings (a tall order).	Wait a few years and the software may improve.....
1,TERRIBLE design...  expected much better from Shubb.  First of all, the small and rounded part that fits over your tuning key, is quite possibly the worst design for a string winder ever made.  Most tuning keys are more squared-off, and the rounded part of this thing just slides all over the place.  Second, it squeaks horribly when you use it.		Just get one from Dunlop or Planet Waves...  this thing isn't worth the time or money
1,I was sent a bag of generic, standard, WHITE bridge pins, when the product picture clearly shows black bridge pins with white dots.		This is not what I wanted, BLATANTLY FALSE ADVERTISING.		I also have to mention that these bridge pins are constructed out of cheap plastic.
1,2 out of 5 lines dead on arrival.  Granted the price is inexpensive, but I at least figured I get a few months out of them.  Disappointed.		Stick with GLS they hold up pretty well for just a few dollars more.
1,Not very clear, wouldnt buy again, good as a toy but the sound is not quality
1,Don't know why I keep buying these batter powered amps.  I've tried VOX, Honeytone and now Fender.  This works, but does not sound very good and is overpriced.
1,OK, Amazon was great, and it arrived in 2 days! However, the previous reviews are right - the wireless mic SUCKS - POS! The sound quality was very poor, it was made of cheap plastic, and it cut out when I got more than a few feet away. So I plugged in my Sennheiser - you need XLR-to-phono cables - and the sound sucked as well. There is no EQ control, and that is a deal breaker for vocals. However, the guitar input was much louder, and my guitar sounded great. I read a review that said they used this on an airfield - whatever! There is no way this puts out much sound beyond filling a small room. I wouldn't even use it for karaoke. I was expecting something bigger and louder. I sent it back.
1,I've owned this stand for ~6 months. I stack 2 very lightweight keyboards on it - PX-5S (26 lbs.) and VR-09 (11 lbs., on top). Wasn't bad at first, or maybe I just didn't notice, but the shaking has really been making it difficult to play. It forwards & backwards, as well as side to side. It's mostly the fwd/bwd movement that makes playing difficult. I've tightened every knob and screw I can, but it's useless. I'll be buying a more stable stand, something along the lines of the K&M Omega or something with similar stability. So be aware that the stand may seem mostly solid at first, but it will become wobbly over time. If you play sitting down, it won't be as noticeable and you'll probably be OK with it.
1,Nothing but headaches.  From over modulation problems to needlessly complex routing to serious monitoring issues, this is bad.  If you are new to Presonus I/O's, turn back now and run away.  I'm just deeply disappointed and frustrated with this experience.  When you can get it to work (sometimes just barely) it gets the job done.  This was the last straw for the Presonus line of hardware for me, though. I can't settle like this anymore.
1,Can't get intonation right have tried everything hang on wall it is pretty and I have set up my other guitars forever
1,Frets were faiy level, Not a bad neck profile. Heel needed some sanding, too thick and too wide. Skunk stripe popped out as soon as I put strings on it. Frets are tiny.
1,The screw mounts in the base were defective. The screws were not threaded correctly for it. Had to return
1,It is suppose to sound like a tube amp. I like the actual Tube Ultra Gain Mic 200, with a new tube, this sounds nothing like a tube amp. A few of the settings are workable and I do like the high pass sweep. Just use it for recording into an iPhone.
1,I had my school district order 7 of these for me and my guitar class.  They have their own Amazon account, but I'm writing this on my personal account, since this where I carefully picked them out and showed them what I wanted for the students. The picture shown at the top (and near the review I'm writing now) were NOT what was sent to us.  There is a picture at the very bottom of the Amazon page that shows what ACTUALLY comes in the box.  We got a few that were the nice white pick-guard and the amp that says "Fender" on it and looks like any classic Fender amp should.  The rest were the ugly red pick-guard with the lame looking "Squire" amp.  Thanks for taking advantage of a school - it's easy to do, since they are a bureaucracy, and you will probably never have to answer for ripping them off!
1,Horrible, the keys are fake and cheap. The drum pads...for lack of a better word...SUCK HUMONGOUS DOG POOP. The macros are cheap and plastic, I paid 100 for a semi-weighted m-audio MIDI and had a better experience with that. I even took it apart and tried fixing the pads. HORRIBLE UNIT FOR THE HIGH PRICE. DO NOT BUY
1,I've had an SR-16 for years.  Loved it; used it regularly.  I loved it so much, I started writing Alesis about 10 years ago, asking them to update the sounds to 16-bit.  I bought the SR-18 the day it came out.  Now I'm going to Ebay it.		I need a drum machine for practice.  With a couple of foot pedals, you can run the SR-16 while you and the other guitarists do your thing.  Stop, start, decent fills that are completely logical and predictable.		But the SR-18 is just about worthless in that role.  Yeah, it sounds gorgeous, but it's just unusable as a live-performance tool.  I mean, maybe it's OK if you want to program every single song you do, but to just start it and jam on a song, forget it.  Here are some of the weird things:		Genres not grouped together.  Wouldn't you expect one click to take you from Rock 1 to Rock 2?  Not so.  If you're looking for a rock beat, you have to look all over the list to find the next one.		Different tempos for each pattern.  So. . .you're playing along a 130 bpm but you decide you need a slightly different rhythm.  You dial in a different pattern and wham, you're suddenly playing at 210 bpm.  What's with that??		Different track lengths for each pattern.  On the old SR-16, all patterns were 2 bars; eight beats.  Boring, maybe, but useful and predictable.  It was easy to insert a fill because you knew what was coming.  On the SR-18, some patterns are 16 beats, some are 8, some are 20. . .I forget.  But there you are, jamming along and you go to the Fill function to bring you to the chorus. . .and it starts the fill 8 beats too late.  Sheesh.  With the SR-16 I got so good, I could just tap my footswitch and get a single cymbal crash at the end of a phrase.  Not possible now. . .at least, not without years of study.		So: this machine is probably swell if you intend to program each song you do--and play it exactly the same way each time.  If, like me, you used the SR-16 for practice, for extending a jam while your lead guitarist got his act together, for a quick simple beat that did the job most of the time. . .save your money.  Stick with your old SR-16.  That's what I'm doing.  Alesis, you broke my heart!  Why couldn't you just give us the same great functionality of the SR-16, but with better sounds?
1,Stand is decent - Just watch out for high-end Gibson guitars with Nitrocellulose as the back mount where it rests against the guitar can blemish the coating.  I can no longer use this will have to get a wall mount or something else.
1,Had hopes for this to be an upgrade to my fender solid spruce top and laminated back but had to return. This has no base at all. all mid range.
1,.  UPDATE....Ive purchsed 4 of these over the past...maybe 2 1/2-3 years....as of now, three of the 4 have crapped out. They were fine while they lasted, but I don't abuse cables...they're always properly wrapped right after a gig, and stored in an uncramped fashion...I won't be getting any more of these.
1,Sorry...  very disappointed is stool.  I purchased it to use when I practice bass guitar..... after a couple of hours, I dislike immensely.  First, there were no instructions.  Although it was actually easy to put together once I realized how the parts fit together, it would have been nice to save 30 minutes with a pictures and labels so I didn't have to guess.  And what if I had guess wrong and damaged something?  Then it's on me, right.		Next, the seat wobbles terribly.  You spend more time trying not to shake than you do just sitting.  Very distracting when you have a expensive guitar I your hands that you would rather not bang into stuff.  Doing the wobbly balancing act also wears on your upper thigh.  They get soar from trying to stay in one place.		Finally , for now, the back can only be adjusted between uncomfortable and extremely uncomfortable.  It should further out from the chair and go higher.  It hits me right in the small of the back and becomes painful after about 15 minutes.  I think if I could sit a little further back on the throne's seat, it would solve a lot of my issues.  However, I can't so this throne gets a bad review.		If you are interested in buying this throne, find someplace that has one in stock so you can first sit on it.  I'm sure for some, it is perfect.  For me though, I just wasted $130 that I could have use for a lot of much better things....
1,GOOD STRINGS, they sound GREAT, BUT THEY LOSE TONE VERY QUICKLY, within 2 hours of playing. I now know why my GIBSON's are coming to me new with D'ADDARIO strings on them. LOL, GIBSON 'MEMPHIS' doesn't use GIBSON Strings on their new Guitars. A new ES-335 I just bought had D'Addario strings on it (.46 - .10). LOL, when I did the 1st string change I saw the multi-colour ball ends. GIBSON 'MEMPHIS' ships their new Guitars with D'Addario's on them, WOW !!!
1,this was terrible. don't buy it, for pedals for playing music. it gives a strange pulsing sound into the signal. not worth returning, so this was just throwing money away.
1,It moves to much of place
1,These things suck, the gooseneck part constantly comes loose, slides down, won't get into the position you need it to.  You'd be better off trying Audix's other DFLEX clips, which I do find work better.  However, I have several of these things, and only of them actually still works in some resemblance of the word.
1,I doughty these but after experimenting with them I found them to be more useful in their container, on my shelf and waiting for someone to give them to. Not a waist of money for the lesson I learned.
1,Not sure how long the felt side should last, but mine is worn out after a couple months. Turned it around to the other side, more bass, not sure if I like it.
1,How great can a product be if you can't rely on it to stay together?		On a technical level, the tuner worked great... for all of 5 minutes. I bought it specifically for an acoustic bass because my existing TuneTech clip-on couldn't handle the lower frequencies. But within 20 minutes outside of the box, it was broken. All I wanted to do was adjust it so it pointed toward me and SNAP!! I'm not a big guy either. Sure, my fingers are a little stronger after fretting a bass for years, but it doesn't exactly turn you into the Hulk.		Look at the image above and you have the whole story. The 'Notes' on the image say precisely that the base *may* crack.		This is like buying a BMW where the steering wheel won't stay on. Come on, you've come all this way to make a good product but you can't get around this fatal design flaw?		SAVE YOUR MONEY! Buy a tuner that will LAST longer than a day.
1,I finally got this to work. But I had to spend an extra $30 as well as 4 to 5 hours of labor.		I basically had to rebuild to clamp because it wasn't strong enough to support the weight of the stand (without any microphone attached).		It also doesn't reach nearly as far as the description claims, so I had to use more parts from another mic stand to make it reach.		There's mic stands that sell for a little over $100. I thought I was being smart by getting this one, but I should've just purchased the other one. Do yourself a favor and spend $100 on a quality stand. After spending $30 on extra parts and 4 to 5 hours of labor (which is equal to at least $164), this is just not worth it.
1,Too stiff, doesn't sound any different than soft plastic.  But, hey that's just me.
1,The Cool Cat was a good sounding pedal but it had 2 discrepancies I did not care for: one was the audible kick it gave in volume when engaged and the other was the half second delay it had between engaging the effect switch and the time the effect actually kicked in.  This is unacceptable!  I've seen cheapo effects that cost a lot and don't do this!! Spend a little more money for something better; you'll be glad you did!
1,I don't know what the problem is. I just went through 2 high E strings in less than a month. I ordered this pack and gave a set to my friend. I kept 2 for my self thinking they would last me,but the high E quickly broke off...the first time could've been my fault I guess, I was trying to stretch the string out but it broke off. the second time I was just retuning. since I do do that a lot. I go from standard sometimes all the way down to B..As I was dropping the string, it just broke off. i've used nothing but Ernie Ball slinky's since I first began playing guitar and those are the strings that i've pretty much stuck to. They have never broken this quickly ever.		I don't know if it's the quality of the d'addario's or my guitar has some bridge issues.. But I have never had strings break off on me so easily...Since Amazon is only offering Slinky's as add on items I went with these even though I had never used a set ....Maybe I was wrong to try a different brand I had never used..		UPDATE: I was contacted by the company and they were able to solve my issue. I think I may have gotten some old sets,i'm not quite sure,but the year on the box was 2007,i'm not sure if that was the year the strings were made or just a random date on the box. But the company helped out and everything is good now :)
1,I used one of the capo for just a couple of times. One day, it suddenly broken into pieces in my hand. The problem is that it used a thin plastic ring to hold two aluminum parts together. This is a BIG NO NO. It definitely need to use a metal ring to hold aluminum parts together. A BIG Design Failure!!! How can you guarantee a lifetime usage? :-(
1,I found this item not as good as I supposed. When you have different sizes of guitars probably, you should buy another item. However, it is just for the price
1,Didn't work. Typically I end up liking all Behringer stuff. not this one. Remember to register your Behringer products. You only get one year of warranty if you don't, 3 if you do.
1,While I'm a big fan of the BDI21, the GDI21 was a disappointment.		It's hugely noisy above unity gain and never actually quiet, which pretty drastically limits its usefulness in its intended role as a studio DI unless it's used with a noise gate of some sort.		The BRIT and CALIF settings pretty much sound like every cheap dirtbox in the world -- harsh, gritty and nasty.		The MIC settings just seem to add layers of muffling to the signal.		The TWEED settings are less objectionable, but ultimately and after repeated tries I can find no real use for this thing except as an emergency backup in the gigbox.
1,Arrived loose and rattling in package. Scratched. To cheap to bother returning.
1,I Bought These, I Have a Ludwig CS ELITE Siver Sparkle Kit according to the sizes it should fit but my kit won't fit in these cases.
1,I am very disappointed in these strings. They do note resonate like my Martin Silk and Steel. Thought I would give them a try but I will stick with Martin strings.
1,Microphone was DOA. Do not buy ..at least mic stand works
1,Did not fit. So I returned.
1,I Bought this item last week . got it yesterday used it for about 10 minutes and did not like the sound it gave. i returned it today not for me need a better sound .
1,THe sound is horrible. It's noisy and sounds nothing like what I had expected. Went back the  Moor unit which was far superior.
1,I have several brands and price ranges of harmonicas.  This one is the cheapest an definitley the worst.  It is not even close to being air tight and you have to blow very hard to be able to hear it.  I would not recomend it to a beginner because he will just get frustrated and give up.  You should upgrade at least to a Hohner Old Standby to start.  The only way I might recomend the Johnson would be to buy the complete set, throw the harps away and you have a decent case for your other harps.
1,Broke in under 90 days. I only used it four times. There are other cables you can get that will hold up.
1,Do not buy this product unless you absolutely cannot afford something better. This instrument will not be useful for anyone beyond the earliest levels in learning. It is more of a toy than a violin, but it can help you learn how to hold a violin and very basic bowing and songs. It is useless for learning tone production which is about 70% of playing violin. It doesn't have a bass bar as far as I can see. The pegs fit very poorly. The wood is very low quality. It is unresponsive. It sounds incredibly tinny. The fine tuners on the tailpiece will quickly break if you use them. Everything is really low quality.		Really, you need to spend at least about $500 on a violin to get something serviceable that be usable for you for a long time. If you buy this violin, you will be upgrading to one like that soon.
1,Was good, even worked on my Win 10 laptop.		...and now it does not.		Driver much?		I hate people that allow equipment that could work to do the opposite.
1,Cheapest piece of plastic you could find to make these pins. Two pins broke while tuning...the strings were fine and not user error. They also would not hold strings securely (Elixir)
1,I've bought a bunch of these over the last few years and 75% of them have gone bad within 2 years.  They simply don't last.  Get something better.
1,Bought this behringer headphone amplifier to give my headphones a little more boost .. received my package on delivery time but did not perform anything as described in the detailed description. . I would return it if i had that option. .. don't waste ur money
1,Too small. I'm sending it back. I'd buy it if it was bigger.
1,Though I don't own this item it is import for you to know that Rolls PM351 (personal monitor system) is better because it is already a Direct Box (a box that cuts sound interference).	This one is missing the output port to make it a DI box.	In other words, with Rolls PM351 you save extra costs.
1,Guess anyone can get a bad cable. Just bought this and never got to use it cause anytime you moved it it lost connection. Looked like the molded ends would be good in the long run. I bought a 20' GLS audio cable that is working fine right now. My friend calls them Iron cables cause that's what they look like. It had the fabric like the old electric irons had back in the day. This cable feels cheap when you hold it. The diameter of the cable is rather small compared to some.	Anyway I sent this one back in exchange for another one. Guess that will take about a month to get another bad one.	2nd one!!!!	I sent the first one back cause it didn't work. Now the replacement one has stopped working. If you play for a living or in front of people you might want to buy a better cable. This one is sure to ruin your night if you don't have backup.
1,it is perfect don't get me wrong yet it won't fit my amp so I had to sell it. Make sure it fits your amp first.
1,I've been trying lots of different harmonicas recently, in lots of a different keys.  This is one of my least favorites.  Several notes just don't play at all.  At first I thought it was my technique, but I own about a dozen other harmonicas, and I don't have this problem with any of them.  Sent it to Suzuki to see if it could be fixed, but it came back with all the same issues.  The notes that work, sound great, but it's nearly unusable due to the other issues.
1,I really wanted to like this pedal, however I can not recommend it. As a bass player I expected Boss to fix the problem with gain reduction and tone quality reduction. They have not. You have to adjust the input levels at the pedal input level, pedal play back level, pedal main level, amp gain level, master amp level. My band uses a PA so I then have to adjust direct out level, PA input level, pa output level. By the time I got all of these set correctly my tone sucked ass out of my $5000 bass. No thanks. I diddnt get the best bass I could afford so that this pedal could steal the great tone and gain. It can do a lot of things, but not very many things at one time. You can play bass and have vocals come through the PA unless its playback only. It just doesnt do what I wanted it to do. I also tried setting the tracks playback/recording levels and they always seemed to be off. I guess if you're an acoustic guitar player with one PA that everything runs through then it may work well for you. Also one annoying thing to mention, there is a hidden setting where all the outputs are default set to %100 delay. And it is on all 99 tracks. annoying! I think being able to play without looping anything actually improves your musicianship anyway. I will be returning mine and getting back to basics.
1,BEWARE! As another reviewer has stated, these are NOT genuine Fender celluloid guitar picks! Sadly when things are too good to be true, they usually are and this is one of those things. These are clearly made of a glossy, thicker plastic and not celluloid as advertised. These picks do not even come in official Fender packaging, rather a flimsy plastic zip lock with a laser printed sticker. Official fender grosses come in the typical clam shell packaging like the 12 packs. I had an original gross pack lying around here as I go through these like water and now I can't find it, but if I do I will post a picture. I've posted a pic of a 12 pack so you can see what the picks should come in when they are an official Fender product. Either way, these being sold here on Amazon in this listing are fakes and I am not happy. For one, I am not happy because this would have been a great deal on Fender picks and for two because this order was fulfilled by Amazon and not some other third party. Amazon, why are you selling me cheap knockoff BS as the real thing? What is going on here? Again, I have been playing guitar for almost 30 years and Fender Medium celluloid picks are the ONLY picks I use on a regular basis for recording and jamming and these are clearly NOT the real thing. If you don't care what your picks are made of, this might be a good deal for you on a giant bag of cheap glossy plastic picks... but if you are a serious player and are expecting the quality and feel, that only the original Fender celluloid pick can deliver, look elsewhere, you have been warned! I'm appalled...		As for the pictures I have posted; the picture on the left of the two individual picks, the one on the left is an official Fender Medium Celluloid and the one on the right is a shiny plastic pick that was sent to me. Notice that it's darker and a bit thicker. The original picks have a matte finish due to the way they are made and the material. The picks I received on the right are glossy and "polished", probably because they were tumbled unlike the fenders. The picture on the right, you see the cheap plastic bag I got from Amazon with their laser printed label. The clam shell 12 pack is original Fender packaging. I know these still come in grosses in the clam shell because I still buy them this way locally, albeit at a higher price. So, yes Fender does still manufacture the gross and sell it in the official packaging. Hope this helps someone out.
1,Absolute overpriced junk! Produces much less bubbles than $35 no name machine I have. Poor design: Fan is way too powerful - strong wind prevent bubbles from forming at wands, soap liquid container build from very thin plastic (similar to disposable caps) and will not stay long, when hood opens for liquid refill, soapy liquid drops fall directly to the fan motor - it will be damaged very soon. Need to return and get proven No Name $35 snow machine.
1,Strings unfortunately oxidized almost completely in less than a week...		I've purchased elixir 80/20 bronze nano web strings before from guitar center, and they lasted months before even a hint of oxidation.	These on the other hand are practically garbage after 5 days of being on the guitar with light use.	Disappointing..... I'll have to replace them with ones from a store I can trust has good quality.
1,Had these installed and one of the pots was fried just take your guitar to your local music shop and let a professional help you.
1,Through my Ampeg bass amp, the low E string gets distorted when you push the bass control above 7, and the upper 3 strings sound kind of plain.
1,Maybe I just got a bad one, but this bridge is poorly finished. There are extreme stamping striations at the rear of the bridge where the adjuster screws pass through. These striations are really severe. Also, the bottom side of the bridge is a mess. I know that you'll never see it once mounted, but it just adds to the fact that this (these) bridge(s) are poorly made with little or no attention to quality control. This bridge is unacceptable, especially for an item that is "Made in USA"....or so they claim. The workmanship is so poor that I'm beginning to wonder if this may be a fake. Whatever the case, this bridge isn't going on my '54 build. Unfortunately, this bridge sat unopened on a shelf in my shop for a couple of months during which time the return window for Amazon had closed. That's my fault. I should have inspected the part immediately so I wouldn't be stuck with it. The bottom line here is that it's up to you. You can take your chances and buy this bridge from Amazon, but I would inspect it immediately. A better route would be to buy it locally and check it for quality before handing over your dinero. BTW-I snapped some photos hoping that I could include them in this review only to find that video is the only option.
1,Made in China. Another tube amp builder bits the forbidden fruit of PRC. RIP H&K
1,I bought these because I needed to replace 1 peg on my guitar and Guitar Center / other official sites were either way more expensive or only sold sets of 6.		Pro: Super cheap and saved me a lot of money to replace one peg	Cons: Came with only 8 / 12 of the screws it should have, and 5 of the screws stripped before I found 2 that finally worked.		If I needed to replace more than 1 or 2 pegs, I would have returned this immediately. I'm giving it 2 stars because for my particular purposes it saved me a bunch of money and worked, but overall it's a pretty low quality product.
1,NOT SUPPORT IPAD....
1,Used it briefly but hated it and ended up selling it on. The tone is awful, and the effects are useless, why not have a dial for the effects so that you're not just drenched with unusable reverb/delay. iRig is much more effective and way cheaper, wish I knew that before I bought this
1,Wtf I was going to put a speaker on this but I can't reach 8' and I need my monitor next to my ear. This pole is like 5' long no way you can use this with out cutting it
1,Sorry, but no cigar!....I just got this nice looking uke and as soon as I strummed it a few times,	I knew I had to return it!..	I must be the only "Killjoy"  who's giving this uke a bad review!.. sorry, but I'm only	guided by what I hear, and I hated what I heard when I strummed this sad uke!..		Look, it could be that I'm used to my baritone ukes which  all have a "Mellow" sound.	I have three wonderful baritone ukes, and they ALL sound pretty darn good to my ears!..		Yes, I did tune this uke before I had strummed it...
1,I liked the design. However, being a professional musician and lead singer, I found it cheaply made and sounds more like a toy. I sent it back.
1,These are supposed to be more secure than round end pins, but I find it difficult to fit even my least stiff straps over them. There's nothing wrong with the quality, just, for me, the design.
1,I have a mid 1990's Fender Bullet Series Squier, and this tremolo arm does not fit. Don't waste your money.
1,it was an alright kit but felt cheap
1,I purchased this pedal with great anticipation to add to my pedal board. After finally arriving I had the wind taken out of my sails when it didn't work ! I've used Electro Harmonix pedals in the past and have performed pretty good for the cost.  I guess I could have just got a lemon.
1,I was very disappointed with this product. Can't play guitar through it, just vocals. Very complicated and confusing to operate. You CAN get it to harmonize OK if you spend enough time figuring it out, but then it is still confusing to operate live. Something simpler would have suited me better. I should have returned it. Just collecting dust now until I can try to sell it.
1,This thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked. What can you expect for $20 tho. This was a temporary solution I don't recommend this for long term use it will probably fall apart.
1,Does not work with Pyle-Pro Electronic Table Digital Drum Kit.	Does not work with Pyle-Pro Electronic Table Digital Drum Kit
1,I have to agree with other posters - this works OK, but it is NOT a Martin product and Amazon should stop listing it as such. Amazon claims it is a "Martin Guitar Humidifier by Martin", despite complaints going back over 1 year that point out the discrepancy in the manufacturer listed. Time will tell how well it holds up, but it is frustrating that there appears to be no attempt by Amazon to rectify the misleading information listed, or actually ship the product that was advertised.
1,I don't care how much I choke up on these.  I still can't get the level of stiffness that is available in a Dunlop Tortex green.  I was very exited to try these, but after trying them extensively on both acoustic and electric guitars, I can say that these just don't work for me.  If you already use and enjoy thin picks, then I would recommend giving them a go.  Otherwise, don't waste your time and money.
1,tried, didn't like, the pad actually hits and catches on the strings when playing fast licks. OK for beginner player
1,Hold mic plastic screw surface worn out first and only time I tried to take it away and see if somehow this piece of junk was compatible with Excelvan's BM-800 shock mount (and it is not by the way and Amazon suggests this product to be purchased along with previously mentioned microphone). I'm not able to use it with my mic plus after I adjust the arm with the stand it moved losely one side to another. Lack of quality in this product that's why it is $13.50.		Updated review.		Muy recording needs does not state I have to move my mic from side to side very often but as I said before you can't use this suspension scissor stand right out of the box. Initially I gave this product 1 star since it does not come with a mic shock mount thread adapter. I had to go to local music audio and electronic stuff store to get this one. It cost me only US$ 1.10, I mean... Why didn't Neewer included this thread adapter along with scissor arm stand? It could save me some time and may have improved my post-purchase experience. Now product has 2 stars since previous defects reported can't be corrected by user.
1,I am not very satisfied with this product. First of all, the suction cup does not work. Second of all the sound quality is not very good. 'Regular' or more standard pickups will work certainly better, and I am going to buy one of those.
1,Mine was quite noisy during operation. Negated any advantage of the EQ. I didn't really take time to test the frequencies function. Returned it.
1,I don't hate Behringer stuff, I actually like more their products than I dislike, but the pedal misses the mark. Just makes everything sound farty. I prefer the Joyo Voodoo Octave, which admittedly is pretty different compared to the SF300 as far as fuzz pedals go, but as cheap fuzzes go, the Joyo is still in my pedal chain.
1,Not a completely garbage product, but beware....they won't fit the pot shafts on American stuff.  Bought these for a Carvin, to replace the gold hardware.  Won't fit the tone/volume pots.  If you have a cheap imported guitar, they might be just the trick, but they don't work for me.  YMMV
1,I Did not think it was loud enough or worth it. It needs a preamp. I do not use it.
1,It's an ok case. It is what it is. It's plastic and the hinges too. You have to cut the lower foam out to fit the unit in and it's not in cubes. Don't know what they were thinking.
1,Ends connect securely but noticed that there was increased noise when this cable is used as an extension.
1,They're probably fine for standard 7 string tuning. However, on my Ibanez RG7 string they're incredibly loose and wobbly even when tuned down a half-step from standard. Bottom line if you're playing in anything other than standard don't even bother. Personally I don't even really like these anyway but they are not the worst strings for the price.
1,This strap is well-made and potentially comfortable, but at its longest length, shorter than many other straps I own. Disappointing but not worth returning.
1,This is not the original LP guiro
1,First Behringer pedal I have returned. Almost no effect provided by pedal. I have returned the unit. Not worth it. Lousy pedal.
1,Not worth buying imo, something on the inside broke within a couple of weeks and it won't work now
1,not very loud - it works in quiet situations but anything with any more noise and its just loud enough.
1,After trying 2 different units both of which did not work as advertised, I have given up and returned both units for credit. I would look elsewhere for a good tuner... I actually purchased a 3rd one snd it seems fine. The setup instructions are not very helpful. I had the store where i bought it set up.
1,Get a Comfort Strapp instead.  You get what you pay for.
1,Was not completely satisfied with this product.
1,It's okay as is, but it would be better if it was designed similar to the one Martin sells. If it didn't have the "Martin" logo on their version it could be used on any guitar. Just a thought.
1,Even at minimum setting the effect dominates your sound, not enhances it.  Maybe if you are a EVH fan you might be better able to appreciate what this box does.
1,Honestly I have to say I am disappointed in the Tascam DR-70D.  First of call it is HORRIBLE on batteries, I don't care, rechargeable or not, put them in and it says you are at half power instantly!  This is bad news for a portable device.  Some people complain about the battery door, frankly if it was made of paper I wouldn't mind it as long as the unit would just not chew through so many batteries.  At a certain point it says it''s about to die but you don't know if you have 1 minute or 2 hours left.  There is also an issue of a hiss that won't go away no matter what you do.  In the last year it has stayed on the shelf for paying jobs because I just can't trust it.  But it sure does look nice.  You would think a company like Tascam would have a better handle on this.
1,This review is long overdue.  When I bought these the description clearly said "4 packs" 4 sets of strings.. I only received 1 set. I pack. Only 4 strings total. Not cool. Not cool. Still mad about it and I'm sure it's been over a year since I ordered these..
1,They squeak like crazy and I am not happy about waxing or oiling or lubing or doing anything to compensate for this. They simply should not squeak.
1,Hi there, I have a month with the VoiceLive 3 Extreme. Both voice and guitar effects are very good (when they work). The first problem came a day when I was playing my guitar and my glasses fell on the VL3X it turn to silent and lost the programming that I had selected. I had to unplug it and wait 10 minutes for it to "recover" from the "impact". My discomfort grew when the same thing happened when I was playing and press a button with my foot.		Today the VL3X was blocked again while I was playing (I swear I don't even touch it).		I have over 40 years playing electric guitar and at least 30 using effects for guitar and voice. Really I do not understand why a device like this can be so "delicate".		I do not know if you sent me a defective VL3X and maybe this only has happened to me.		Honestly I'm starting to believe that I threw away US$1,000 for a device that does not work as it should be.		Im thinking to go back to my Digitech effects (Vocalist live 5 and IPB10).		Thanks for make me wast that money.		Mario
1,This strap costs about $1 to make. It is cheap and low quality. I will be returning it promptly/  It sucks!
1,Be careful with these...		The thickness and 16AWG is excellent for the price...		However... be sure to test them on a cable tester and be prepared to re solder the wire so the correct pin goes to the same on the other side.		You can run into phasing issues with these and worse... damage to your mic if phantom power is sent to the wrong pin.		Other reviews turned me onto this and sure enough I discovered the problem on some of there wire. Most were just fine... but it only take one to really mess up a recording, phasing or cause damage.		Not risking it with these guys anymore.
1,Yes, it is possible to tell the difference between this mic stand and, say, a Snicker's wrapper, but you have to have decent eyesight or be at close range.		In all seriousness, this is a very inexpensive mic stand, and might be the only one this cheap that is made of metal. Before you buy it on that fact (as I did), remember that tinfoil is also "made of metal." This stand will remind you more of tinfoil than the quality mic stands you may have used. Don't expect the stand to be heavy or to stay put once set up; it weighs less than some of my mics. It gives the "I could bend this with my bare hands" feeling.		Next issue: the paint on the threads binds with the mic clips you put on, and when trying to get them off, the entire thread tip of the stand twists inside the tubing that contains it. Unbelievable. I had to use pliers to grip the thread head just to get my mic off, and now the thread head is loose.		For cheap stands, I've had a couple of lightweight ProLine stands that have lasted a few years, and dollar for dollar I think DR Pro stands are pretty great. My advice is spend $70 on a mic stand if you're planning to use it for more than a week.		Two stars because it IS very, very inexpensive. Might be among the cheapest stands money can buy. And if you're going to put one lightweight mic on the end and never move it (or switch clips), I'd even recommend it. But if you're like me and put medium/large mics on a stand and move it from time to time, $30 is a lot to pay for a week's use out of a mic stand.
1,Based on the maker's/seller's comments to other's reviews, I bought these in January, 2016, but only got to them this month.  They lasted about a week before the note-letters began rubbing off.		Perhaps the maker/seller should withdraw those that are available, and then ensure that they are replaced with those he claims aren't subject to the note-letters rubbing off.
1,NOBODY NEEDS A POP FILTER FOR ANYTHING. DO NOT BUY A POP FILTER.
1,This rack may work for acoustic guitars.  It's a terror for solidbodys or semihollows.  There is nothing to keep the guitars from tipping sideways.  Bumping the rack from the side could cause all guitars to fall sideways, impacting one another and causing serious surface damage.		This rack needs dividers on the bottom rack to keep the guitar bodies in place.  Instead it consists of two padded bars with nothing to stabilize the guitars.  The necks rest against a single post, with nothing to prevent them from being bumped forward int the next guitar.		This would be scary enough as a home rack.  As a travel / performance rack, guitar damage is almost guaranteed.  I would heavily recommend a different method of multi-guitar storage.  Build your own if you have to; it's easy enough.  But avoid this if you prize your instruments.
1,I thought I was would love this strap due to me having a swamp ash bass and reading many reviews on it. The thickness bought an extreme discomfort within sec. It came this morning and I'll be shipping back out for the 2.5"
1,I bought this based on curiosity to see how it held up against its SM57 role model.		I was not very impressed upon plugging it in. The sound was similar to a $3 Pyle-Pro handheld I bought for S&G's, IE quite narrow and tinny. Now one could argue that, like in all things in life, there's a time and place for everything, and that there may be an application for that type of sound. If only I'd gotten the opportunity to truely test it in its intented application.		One of my buddy's is a bit handsy with things, and he decided to open up the microphone. Not a huge deal, that's how you maintain it after all, but one of the cables snapped just from that simple action. This just happened to occur while my soldering iron was out, so I went to repair it. Lemme just say, they used the thinnest humanly possible cables to wire this thing. It's insane. They also gobbed the heck out of it with the cheapest solder imaginable. Oh the lead-head I had that night.		I swapped the wires out with something that had more than one single stand, and added a ground wire to balance it (it wasn't balanced stock, btw), and went to desolder the xlr plug to affix the new wires. Only the actual plug melted while I was desoldering. They really spared every expense on this, and the old saying "you get what you pay for" is truely applicable in this situation.		I purchased a Shure xlr plug to finish repairing the mic, but I haven't been able to be bothered to actually do it, because I know that at the end of the day I'll still use my I5 or 57 or even my d112 before this mic.		If you want to practice soldering, and have any interest in installing transformers on mics, this is an excellent, inexpensive project mic candidate. If you're looking to just plug and play and have a good sound, look elsewhere. It's such a shame, because the actual body of the mic feels very nice, and that's the only reason I'm giving it 2-stars instead of 1. The body is good enough that you could use it for something else, but that's literally it.
1,Just buy a stainless steel straightedge "ruler". This thing isn't any more accurate and many times more expensive.
1,I ordered two of these cables in April.  Today, on September 30, both are not operational.  PVC for connectors is a dumb idea.  Both cables have issues with the straight connector, if I move and hold the connector in an offset position, I can get a signal from the amp.  Other than that, no connection at all.  These cables were a total waste of money.  The 30 day return policy is BS.  I should be entitled to a refund.  Amazon should take responsibility because I bought the cable because touted these "best seller,".  Bestseller or not, these cables are cheap pieces of garbage.
1,Pretty much does nothing but lights up. I guess it would be a nice ornament on a Christmas tree
1,The open end used to pull the pins bends and is unable to accomplish the task.  Ended up using pliers to get the pins out.  Do yourself a favor and buy a better product.
1,Don't get me wrong the light is excellent quality.  It doesn't give off much light though only channeled in one area. I'll have to search for something else.
1,The screw stripped upon attempting to loosen the mounting bracket, which rendered my armrest unusable. Maybe it was a dud? Difficult to adjust.
1,FIVE STARS = audio quality, product design, fun operation, programmability	ONE STAR = durability, practicality		Purchased this device at a brick and mortar on Monday, returned it today because the kick drum button had stopped working. The clerk informed me that they had seen another one of these break and based on the design anticipated this to be a common situation. Although "Pocket" is part of the name of the product, it can't actually be placed in a pocket because there is no off switch and the parameter knobs stick out. The device is extremely fragile as it is just an electronic board with exposed switches. You can't really place it in a backpack or any kind of bag because something will hit the buttons and it will play, draining the batteries. Removing the batteries is difficult and requires flexing the board to an uncomfortable degree, making the metal stand pop off. If you do buy this make sure it is from a seller with an excellent return policy.		One more negative of the design is that if you play with it for a few hours (as I did, having loads of fun) your fingers will hurt because the buttons are sharp.		There's a reason that nobody else would design and ship a product in this unfinished way.		There is a separate case available from Teenage Engineering for another few dozen bucks. It isn't available on Amazon yet but surely will be eventually. If you do decide to commit to buying this you should probably get the case too for protection, both of the product and of your fingers.		For the few days that it did work, this thing was a dream -- wonderful sound, lots of fun to use, everything great that you can see easily in the YouTube videos.
1,I purchased these strings about a week ago and I put them on my acoustic guitar the minute they arrived. Now, I have noticed a buzzing from the G string! Previously I have purchased the Nanoweb strings from Elixir and those would last for up to 2 and a half months! I do not play with a heavy strum and the string is doing this already....? Definitely something wrong here. I would NOT buy this product again!
1,I don't experience what's special about this glove. Wearing it still hurts my fingers to some degree, even worse make my finger fatter to touch other strings. It's not that different than just a regular glove. But don't think it worth the money.
1,no good to setup
1,My friend had one and loved it so I had to get one. I loved it at first until it didn't work 7 months later. I replaced battery and still will not tune. Lights are on but nothing happens. Cant find any warranty information from Amazon as you can see by the listing. My mistake for thinking it was good product.
1,Cheap and flimsy. Should have known. You get what you pay for in life. Spend a little more and get a quality leather strap. Avoid. Delivery fine and fast though!  Cheers
1,I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:		1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.		2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.		3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.		Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:		Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)		Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.		Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!
1,I just received my TC Nova Drive. I order a new unit, but I received either a used or demo unit. The box is beat, the plastic bag that the pedal is in was opened and the pedal itself has fingerprints and small scratches all over the top :-/		I'll revise my review after I receive a new unit.
1,I was really excited about this little thing and bought it at other place, but returned the day after.	Two things.		1. It has TRS jack (the 3rd contact is used for charging), Depending on the type of socket used in your guitar, it may not work. Guitar may "expect" ground where the charging contact is positioned.	For example, it does not work with PRS piezzon equipped models (I have P22, piezzon output works with this, but main out "MAG/MIX" just does not). Google your guitar model before buying.		2. It uses 2.4 GHz to transmit signal. I assume it just uses WiFi. And if you have your WiFi router close to G10, it does not work. They mention it in the manual (it should be 3 meters apart), but who reads manual before buying, right? For most of the people it may be Ok, but if you have WiFi router next to where you plan to use G10 (like I did), don't buy.
1,Didn't fit my yeti.
1,OK
1,Not a pro stand at all. Might be OK for home use but for a gig..forget it. Not sturdy, tips over and too light.
1,Should have spent more. No matter what I do can't get noise floor below around -48 db. Unusable for me. I have no use for a mic this noisy.
1,I don't normally write reviews but this thing is garbage!  This is my second set of these two different brands and I'll never buy this  style again!  Plastic into metal? I had to screw some bolts for extra support because the ends kept slipping out, really annoying.  Spend the extra money on a better quality stand, trust me.
1,Sorry didn't last a month !!! not good quality at all !!  couldn't hold my MXL studio mic clamp broke due to bad design and part made with cheap materials IMO !!
1,This is a ok tuner but understand you are not getting True Bypass so your tone can be affected even when you have the box turned off. The tolerances are not as tight similarly priced models. If you use batteries you will burn through them quickly due to the lack of True Bypass, if your using AC power then this isn't an issue. This is an ok starter pedal, but I would recommend spending the extra ten bucks and getting a tuner with tighter specs and true bypass.
1,Cheap, middle section is the main problem. The knob and insert mechanizim is not dependable to work. 3 parts to this to assemble.
1,meh
1,I couldn't be less happy or annoyed with this purchase.  I purchased through Audiosavings on Ebay back in October of 2015.  In December of 2015 the sub stopped working.  The signal light on the amplifier started to blink in and out instead of solid green.  I tried everything to make sure the settings were fine.  I called their customer service and they told me that only manufacturer defects were covered and that I had to pay to ship the whole thing.  I told them that was ridiculous because it would cost $100+ to do that.  So the guy on the phone eventually told me to just ship the amp so it would be less expensive.  I have spent hours and hours of time with this sub.  Time, gas, money to ship, etc.  Once I receive it back from their facility, still not working!!  I don't have time to bother with crappy service and products.  I purchased a used Alto sub that looks beat to hell, but has been strong for every gig we have played.  We threw our money away purchasing this sub.  live and learn.  They were glad to take my money, but not glad to fix their crappy sub which never really got fixed but cost me more money in shipping and wasted time.  My band plays a lot of shows locally and we talk gear all the time with people.  I will never recommend this brand to anybody.  Only will tell them to steer clear.
1,These used to be the standard, but of the 3 packs I've bought this year only a handful still work. They come apart, leaving the tips inside my pedals' jacks. This requires disassembly of the pedal, sometimes replacement of the jack, to fix. I am not rough with my gear and my pedals sit in one spot. On some of them the tips will easily pull off by hand. I say go with the nicer Hosas with the all metal jacks if you know they'll fit your pedals, otherwise find another brand... these were once good and cheap, now they're just cheap.
1,didn't realize it was a child's guitar.
1,Roland is top notch, but they missed it here. The overdrive channel is very, very weak. Anyone could tell it's an all digital channel. Secondly, the effects are very muddy, especially when used through the line out direct to PA. They don't work well with the overdrive channel either.	The flip side is the clean channel. It's bright and articulate. Works well using your own outboard effects. I guess that defeats the purpose of the amp though. 80watts of clean sound is nice though.	Bottom line: if you're looking for an all inclusive amp, get something else.
1,Cheap junk made in China. Do not buy this mixer. It brakes on you, it does not last, and technical support is very very bad. You stay on hold for hours at a time in order to get someone on the phone. When they finally get on the phone they treat you like garbage. They are only hype, just a gimmick. They are not a reputable company. They do not service their products as they should. We tried to call tech support after the mixer went out and never was able to get them on the phone.		The mixer itself is of extreme poor quality. It is made of cheap junky plastic. It is very flimsy and will not last. It overheats and it stops working. The control knobs are very poorly fabricated and they would fall off. If you want to do yourself a favor, buy a different brand. This company Presonus is not a reputable company based on their product and customer service.
1,A previous reviewer noted that this product has 180 watts output and the 4 ohm internal speaker is rated at 120 watts (he physically inspected the speaker).  He is correct.  Here is the link for the manual:[...]  Even without my training in electrical engineering, it's plain to see there's a serious mismatch here.  Normally you want your speaker to have some "headroom" i.e. a higher power rating than the amplifier feeding it. Most confusing.
1,it came with tuning pegs which were ill fitted and the sound post had come completely loose.  The finish was also WAY cheaper looking than in the images.  I then tried a Stenton, which had a much nicer finish but came with the fingerboard completely detached.  Maybe it's just bad luck, but still....
1,I have 5 Schaller sets of strap locks and bought 2 of the fenders. The 5 Schallers all work perfectly and reliably. 1 pair of the Fenders works ok; of the other pair one lock works ok the other works not at all--will not lock. All the "working" Fender locks are hard to get on and off--apparently not made to close tolerances. They catch sliding onto the button and the plungers do not always latch. There is a reason why Rickenbacker puts Schaller buttons on their guitars and why I just ordered another pair of Schallers.
1,Did not fit my strat plus. Had to throw away.
1,Do your research on this interface having popping and clicking problems. I was really loking foward to this interface but as time went on the problems got worse and the NI support got slower (and they are slow to begin with). I tried all recommendations by NI and suport forums to no avail the problems only got worse. I read some of the negative reviews, looked up the problems and decided to take a chance as I am a huge NI have and have over $4k in there products that all work seamlessly together and have never let me down. Well here is there pos product, take a chance on it the sound quality is better than any of my past 4 interfaces but once the pops and clicks start just return it while you still can!
1,As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. This Ukulele can't hold it's tuning for 30 seconds. On the plus side, you will be a master a tuning the instrument!!!!
1,I purchased these for on stage gigging use. They fail miserably because one of the feet is located EXACTLY where my output jack is and pushes the instrument out of vertical and is unstable unless unplugged. I suppose if all you need is a display stand that never sees a stage then you could use it to store an instrument while unplugged and it would be OK.
1,Front pocket zipper gets stuck at the left cornering part. I have a Van's backpack that i've had longer than this and the zippers work the same day as I bought it. Also, seller didn't accept my return reason. Will not buy again.
1,does not fit at all like the picture shows,the picture they provide shows the outer ring like a halo around the finger tip, so when you wear it it almost acts like a metal finger nail, if you look at the pic I provided you will see the loop is was to narrow and won't fit properly and I have small hands, you can adjust the band that goes around the finger to fit properly but not the loop. the seller only carries the one size, they offered to refund my $ if I sent them back, but since I would have to pay S&H i'd only get  maybe $4-5 back not worth the hassle . $8 wasted
1,I did not like much. It broke soon after use so I think it is of very poor quality. I think this line price.
1,Has casting marks, and dose not look like this pic on amazon. But dose work.
1,This pedal is for amateurs and players who don't know much about music. The only way to use this chromatically so as not to be bound to a 'key' is with the toneprint option. Although the toneprint option seems like a fantastic world to dive into, I have had nothing but problems with the editor on my computer. This last time pushed me over the edge, as it wouldn't even see the pedal so that I could create my own. TC help was unable to solve this issue and was as puzzled as me.		They make some great gear. I love my Sub N Up so much. I also love my k210 & k212 cabs, but this pedal? Nah. I returned it and was glad to do so. Bought an Earthquaker Pitch Bay. Thing kicks ass.
1,I bought these mics mainly for assemblies at my school.  For $50 I wasn't really expecting much, but when I tested them out I was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and range.  I may even try them out with my acoustic duo.  I use Shure SM58s for my bar gigs and these Nady's don't sound much different.  I also put windscreens on them for protection since the other reviews mentioned that they dent easily.  I would highly recommend these for speaking and maybe karaoke.  I would probably go with something a little more sturdy if I were to use them for live music situations.  I play guitar so I really don't need wireless mics as I am stationary.		I am editing my review because I recently used these wireless mics and for some reason the signal is now very weak.  I changed the batteries hoping that this might solve the problem but they still gave me trouble even with new batteries.  A strong signal is a very important feature for a wireless mic.  Otherwise, stick with the regular mics.
1,I bought this so that I could try a few additional tunings for some new songs I'm working on. My band does everything in either Drop C/D Standard, or on a Standard 7 string (B Standard/Drop A). Among other reasons, some riffs/melodies I have in my head just sound better with a Low F# or G at the bottom, so I wanted to try this pedal as an option to get there without needing a third guitar live.		The sound quality is mostly fine. Obviously, as you step more then 4 semitones away from the original signal, it starts to sound fake, but that is true of all pitch shifter pedals and plug-ins. There are some odd sounds in the mid-range of my guitar's scale, but that's not why I'm returning this pedal.		I'm returning it because:	The "Detune" function literally just makes your guitar slightly flat or slightly sharp. According to the manual, the adjustment is between -30 CENTS and +30 CENTS (not semtones; cents!). By the way, none of these numbers actually appear on the pedal itself, so if you're trying to set it to, say, 10 cents down, good luck with that. If this is something you can put to use, more power to you. It would be nice if they labeled the knob that controls it, so that you actually know what setting you're on!		The "Pitch Shift" function (what I bought it for) has seemingly arbitrary preset intervals that it can use, and you can't choose any other intervals. The options are -24, -12, -7, -5, -2, -1, +3, +4, +5, +7, +12, and +24 semitones. And once again, these numbers are nowehere to be found on the pedal itself, so you either have to memorize that ridiculous sequence, or carry the manual around with you at all times.		Actually, after checking the manual again, there is literally NOTHING that this pedal does, that actually corresponds to the numbers on the "Pitch" knob! So why are the numbers even there? +6 and -6? Why are you two even printed on this pedal? The only "6" anywhere in the manual is in the "Harmonist" mode, and the "-6" and "+6" on the pedal don't even correspond to the 6th interval; you set the knob on "-6" or "+6" to get an OCTAVE interval. *facepalm*		So, basically, you can go DOWN 1 semitone, but you can't go UP 1. You can go UP 3 semitones, but you can't go DOWN 3. If you're in standard tuning, and you want to try Pantera's D-flat tuning, or (old) In Flames's C Standard tuning, well, you can't! If you're in Drop D, and want to play some Five Finger Death Punch (Drop B) or new In Flames (Drop B-flat)...you can't! If you prefer to tune to E-flat, but want to get back to standard quickly...you can't! If you play a lot of music in Drop C/D Standard, but want to jam with someone who plays in standard...you can't! It makes no sense! But I guess Behringer knows best which intervals you should be using as a guitarist. So drop your guitar by two octaves and shut up!		And yes, I know I can just re-tune the guitar myself to get the tuning I want. I'd like to remind you that, if I were going to do that, then why did I bother buying a pitch shifter pedal? So I can re-tune to D Standard, THEN drop down 2 semitones with the pedal? Seriously, think about that for a second.		Looking forward to trying a different pedal with more flexibility in pitch shifting options (ie, a pedal that HAS flexibility in pitch shifting options).
1,It stopped working after a few months
1,I've been trying to find a decent A/B switch for awhile to switch between my tube amp and pod rig. Unfortunately, this one did not fit the bill. The switches are too close together, and worse, whichever channel is off still gets signal from the other channel - it bleeds. It does not seem to suck tone at least, even when both channels are on ('Y' mode) but if you use this for 'A' OR 'B' the off channel will get signal bleed. So in my case, when my clean pod is ON (A is selected), the distorted amp which should be OFF (B) but still bleeds through, ruining the clean tone. Also, no 9v adapter - had to use a battery eliminator cable(not included). Fed up with these lousy A/B products - ordered a loop master.
1,Not for a Fender.
1,I've been trying out lots of different harmonicas recently, which has given me a great opportunity to compare and contrast.  The Promaster just strikes me as a mediocre harmonica, despite it's high-end name and price.  It certainly looks great (aluminum comb!) and has a nice looking case.  And the notes that play, play well, and have a very distinctive sound to them, almost smokey.  But like the Suzuki Bluesmaster, I find that some notes just don't play, irrespective of technique or tweaking the reeds.  Overall, I don't regard that as any better than the Bluesmaster, just nicer looking.
1,I got this unit and committed myself to learning all of it's functions. It's pretty easy to operate. After a few hours I was proficient in all of it's functions. But this unit ultimately fell short in my opinon. Here's why: although the sampler is easy to use, it has no quantilizier. I found I had to sample things 4 or 5 times to get the timing right. You can edit the sample but it doesnt play them back as a loop, so you never know if you got a seemless loop until you are done. But the main reason I don't like it is that it takes too many buttons (key strokes) to do anything. It takes about 5 pushes just to delete a pad, which is very tedious (since you do a lot more deleting of bad sample takes then you think you will). You are constantly going in and out of menus to change the default pad settings for each sample and rename it, etc. It's very tedious. It took me an hour to sample 4 easy string pads and make them fire in the right order. It took this long not because it's hard to operate, but because it's just very hard to get the seemless loops for your samples. The only way to make this easier is to employ software in the unit to match the loop structure and cut the 'blips' out automatically. Doing it by ear and using the little LCD screen is very hard, I almost never got it right. The sample chopper function works ok but it relies on you hitting the pad at the exact time, which can be hard for samples that don't have a clear beat. And again, it doesnt let you hear the sample as a loop before you have to save them. So you save it, set it up on the pad, then replay it, all to find that it's not a clean loop, so you have to go back and do it all over again.... so many buttons to push and it gets frustrating fast.  The software worked great for importing wav files, that was the best feature, but the software does not let you edit samples or control the sampling. I found the pads really unresponsive. Even with the sensitivity turned all the way to 16 you really had to hit the top 'bar pads' hard to trigger (the larger surface pads were much better). Im used to roland v-drums which are much more sensitive. Also this unit only has 16 kits programmed! The first thing I had to do was import 10 kits or so just to make it useable (this took a lot of time). Why not have at least 50 kits Roland, so that people can use it as a drum machine and a sampler? Why make it so scaled down, it has the  memory, install more stock kits! I also naively assumed that if I imported a drum loop I could play it at different tempos, this is not possible and was a big dissapointment to me (though this may be obvious to others). Finally, you cant do any sequencing. I thought I would be able to record 3 or 4 drum parts and play them back but you cant. You can combine samples and play over them but this would be an awfully tedious way to build an accompany track. So in the end I returned it. If it was $300 I would have kept it, but for $800 it's really not a good value. If you need a sequencer that you can store some stabs and loops in then it's ok (though way overpriced). If you're going to spend $800 you may as well just save up for a laptop that can do all this and much more.
1,DIDNT SOUND GOOD IN MY EFFECTS LOOP, SOLD IT
1,I ordered the California Clears, Been using for over 10 years & should have the palm tree (As pictured) and I just got blue Fender heavy picks. this product is NOT as described. Not going to return a $4.00 item as it will cost more to do that than to just keep them and go buy the correct ones somewhere else
1,I think a lot of the "unbiased" reviews for this stand are a load of old codswallop. It's certainly not as well made, or functional as all the positive reviews are making it out to be.		It's made of real thin metal. Not necessarily a bad thing, it's the same they use for their mini stands which I actually like, but it doesn't work for this product. Your mic stand is supposed to be rugged and tough, like your whiskey-drinking, cigar-chomping great-granddaddy. This stand when fully extended not only rattled, but also dipped before I'd even put a microphone on it. The knob for the boom arm is very tight, and very touchy and you have to crank it just to keep it out, which sucks.		It failed the test when I put a 4033 on it. I got the boom arm to stay up, but when I looked down I saw that the stand was literally bowing to the side. Like it was going to snap in half. I wouldn't trust this stand with any condensers, only maybe a (small) dynamic.		So in the end, I'm glad I only got one to test out first, before buying more like I'd planned on. The stand's not worth returning, since I'm sure I can find a use for it, like keeping for a pop filter stand. But definitely steer clear of this product if you want something sturdy that will actually last the test of time.		Unlike 95% of the reviewers, I actually paid for my stand, so this is as "unbiased" as it gets. The only plus from this purchase is that it came with two mic clips. Whoop-dee-doo.
1,I bought this because it looked big and I figured it would put out a lot of light, it doesn't.
1,Frets were faiy level, Not a bad neck profile. Heel needed some sanding, too thick and too wide. Skunk stripe popped out as soon as I put strings on it. Frets are tiny.
1,This stand is way too flimsy, might get by with using it in one spot but don't count on using it at gig's.
1,It seemed like a good product but, a major sewn seam near the zipper ripped within two months.  Look for something else.
1,Amazing at first but after not playing for 3 weeks in my case they got rusted really bad...might go back to elixirs or other strings that won't rust as fast.
1,The sound is good, but the adjusting screw came loose even after being tightened and was lost.
1,The silver bolt's has internal threading to attach onto a smaller black bolt that is affixed to the clamp.  The issue is that the threading goes the same way - so when unscrewing the silver part comes off and you have to get pliers to get it out of your mic mount.  This makes it a hassle to deal with on the road or if you ever have to move your mic.
1,Looks like from other reviews its a hit and miss item. The G port was blocked by the reed so I opened tuner case and carefully bent reed back reed away from port opening so it could vibrate a sound. Great if mine worked otherwise just two stars.
1,I would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a Squier Bullet Strat, but the holes didn't line up, it didn't fit between the neck and the bridge, in fact, it was completely wrong. Nice quality though.
1,Poor quality !
1,Warped vinyl. Maybe they don't know know how to store vinyl records after they come from the retailer. I'll keep it just because I like the color. ( Next time I'll go direct to store like I usually do)
1,Like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off. I tried to glue it back on, but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that. If you buy this, you really need to baby it! My advice is look for a more sturdy model!
1,The first two sets of strings were fine, loved them. Just opened the third pack and found they'd left out the 1st and 2nd (E & B) strings. Bought them long enough ago that I can't ask for a refund - which I wouldn't ask for since I already used two sets. But I do think they should send me my other two strings.
1,Holds picks but doesn't stick well
1,These weren't impressive. With a leather strap, these things pop off my Taylor acoustics heel strap button rather easily. Luckily, the nice Levys leather strap holds tight. These rings aren't adding anything and are basically a waste as they're too soft and pliable. Im going to have to stop by the hardware store to find something that works better.
1,Tried this in two different laptops, a windows and a mac and in two different locations and I get a ton of radio interference, I know it's cheap, but for recording it's no good to me at all. Possibly I have a defective one or maybe just the USB cable is very poorly shielded.
1,Don't waste your money on this product. I bought this because it had a clutch on it, It will not hold up the weight of the microphone, a SM58. It just slides down to its lowest point. If you were a really short person it might work for you, I happen to be 6' 4" and it just does not work for me.	'
1,The unit that I got, Made in Pakistan, was nothing more that a tourist trinket or childs toy. 4 Stars for a toy. Dull Sound. Floppy head. No tone to skin, jingles flat and clinky. Wood marred, poorly joined.
1,These stand need to be made a little thicker because they bend when they are put up to the top of the limit. From the second tear down they seem to be OK but after that they bend.  The poles need to bigger in diameter.
1,Didn't work.
1,I got this for an Epiphone P93 Riviera with 3 dogear pickups and a Bigsby. The case fits perfectly. I love it. Haven't flown with it yet. I wish the people at SKB had made their Les Paul cases with Bigsbys in mind. I have another SKB case, and it's too tight for my Burny Les Paul clone w/Bigsby.		EDIT: the handle blew up, and I had to replace it.		SKB is great about warranty claims. If your case has an issue, they will send new parts without a hassle. Also, the cases are sturdy, and they pamper your guitars.		Now, to the problem. The handles explode. I don't mean they crack. They shatter instantly, in several pieces, and the guitar hits the ground before you know what's happening.		I have two SKB cases with molded handles. One blew up a few years back, and the other blew up a few days ago.		If you contact them, they send you a new handle. You have to install it. To do that, you have to damage the lining a little.		The obvious question: will the new handles explode like the old ones? SKB needs to confront the issue publicly. I'm afraid to buy new SKB cases.
1,This drum has potential to sound nice, but the shell is the only thing that seems to hold promise. There are no washers under the tuning lugs, the stock heads are awful, the snare wires don't meet the resonant head much even if you try to crank them up super tight, and some of the lugs don't even have a full tuning range. I was attempting to tune this drum and there was at least two lugs that simply got stuck, while the others still had a far ways to go before they reached their limits. I tried using some better lugs but those fared even worse. Even with washers, an Evans G1 coated batter head, and Gibraltar snare wires, this drum just doesn't deliver. I once used a popcorn snare made by Griffin and it was absolutely fantastic right out of the box, had no issues whatsoever. This seems to be the exact opposite, you'd have to replace just about everything on it save the snare strainer (which also sucks) to make it sound nice.
1,I didn't purchase these from Amazon, I got them at a "bargain warehouse" type place for about half price.  That being said, I was willing to take the reduced financial risk of buying a Pyle Pro product.		I took these home, plugged them into my practice rig at home and walked around the house and even out into the yard -- no problems.  I was quite pleased with the deal I got.		Fast forward, doing my first wedding gig.  I hadn't had a gig were wireless mics were a necessity (birthdays etc.), but for a wedding you need one (at a minimum) for the best man/maid of honor toasts.  I got set up, walked around the reception hall and even out into the cocktail hour, no problems, they sounded great. BUT -- when the hall was full of people, and the best man was making his speech, the mic would drop out for a fraction of a second periodically.  It wasn't terrible, and fortunately I was the only one scrutinizing the audio quality while everyone else was listening intently to the best man's speech, so nobody else seemed to notice.		The distance from receiver to mic was no more than 125 feet, and there was even line-of-sight.  The only possible explanation I can find for the drop-outs was interference from the photographers' wireless flash controllers.  It would be consistent with the seemingly sporadic and brief drop outs.  However, from my research, most wireless flashes operate in the 340MHz to somewhere under 500MHz range, while these mics are 174MHz - 219MHz (my specific set is 191 and 219 I believe).		Regardless of the reason, people pay good money for a professional DJ, and I'm not willing to accept poor or mediocre performance from equipment.  I'll have to do what I should have done originally and shell out the money for a reliable Shure product.		These are great for personal/home use or maybe small church groups, but if you're charging people for your service, they deserve better -- look elsewhere.		Oh and as someone else said... it's rack-mountable, but the mic charging docks are on top?  Dumb design.  Also, buy some Duracells.  Don't use the blank white plastic rechargables that came in the case... no brainer.
1,I'm a little confused about the end of the boom and why it doesn't have the screw on bit.
1,I got this set of strings for Christmas, both these green ones and an orange set. On the back of the box it says something like-		"The main reasons players tell us they prefer DR strings are: Easy bending and feel great, brighter edge to sound, and noticeably longer life".		 They're probably the easiest bending strings I've used yet, I'll give them that. They didn't really sound brighter... noticeably longer life? More like noticeably shorter life. The strings were dead within two weeks. The B string broke and most of the strings coating wore off, and they sounded horrible. I bought two sets, and when I put the second set on, it only lasted one week! The B string again broke, and they were ridiculously hard to tune. By the way, I only practice for about an hour a day... DR strings have by far the shortest life span out of any other brand
1,don't fit .. don't work. now you have to paid for the app...
1,The switch is well made, but it's slightly too wide to fit into the rout on my 2012 American Standard Telecaster, regardless of which direction you mount it to the swtichplate cover. So unless you want to do some woodwork, you might try a different switch. I didn't because the switchplate already barely covers the rout. I bought it to go along with some Bill Lawrence Keystone pups--Bill has a wiring diagram that uses a five-way switch. Guess I'll try a standard Strat switch instead.
1,It does amplify the signal really but noise comes with it. :(	Lots of ground noise even though it is grounded.
1,We bought several of these, and the t-bar assembly keeps falling apart on them.  The company's website wants $6.00 a piece for replacement parts (three t-bar assemblies would almost pay for a new microphone stand).  The boom arm at the top of one of the stands won't stay screwed in any more, and we've only used these a few times a year.  They may be inexpensive, but they'll get their money out of you in replacement parts. I won't buy any more of their stands, they're junk.
1,When I first attached this adapter, the PC recognized it and installed drivers, but as soon as I attempted to send any MIDI data through it (tried 3 different controllers) the PC would drop the connection and then give me the 'unrecognized device' message.  After a bit of online research, I found a driver that corrected the problem and I was able to use it for about a half-hour.		When I went to connect it again however, I first got the 'unrecognized device' and then NOTHING.  I attempted connecting to 3 other PCs (XP & Win7) and none of them even see that a device is attached (though the power led is lit).		At less then six dollars, it's not even worth my effort to send this hunk of garbage back (FYI, it's not eligible for exchange).  Instead, I will be avoiding this seller in my future Amazon orders.
1,It was a nice cheap little pedal to get me going. It worked for a while then the internal switch broke.  It's simply not built to last through very many presses.
1,I bought this to use with amplified harmonica. It does stop some of the feedback, but mutes the tone a lot in the process. I did not like the sound. I sent it back for a refund. My Kinder AntiFeedback Plus is more expensive, but WAY better.
1,It is not at all what I expected . I don't seem to get the hang of it.
1,It marks certain heads (tom's) more than others (snare) but it definitely leaves a black spot where it strikes the head.  I'm going to check out the plastic tips to see if that eliminates the problem.		I contacted the seller of my order, Music123, and asked to return the sticks that mark my drumheads.  They don't allow returns.  I understand on the used drumsticks, but they will not allow me to return the unused drumsticks either.  If you buy from Music123, you need to be aware of this.
1,Bought this to plug into the mixer at a 600 person event. It did not work. Had to use a phone type 24" flimsy cord into my own monitor. The gig went off great, but I'm very disappointed with this cable.
1,This doesn't do a good job at all. I wish that i could return it! My advise to anyone is just don't buy it. WHAT A WASTE!
1,Good for Hunting Wabbits...because you need to be verwy quiet. There is a lot of Peavey gear that I love but the KB3 is a FAIL. Maybe I'm just thinking of my old school Meredian, MS USA stuff! Didn't hesitate to buy Peavey but will be more cautious next time. Sad how many good names (for example Kenmore) sure don't mean what they used to. How does the saying go?, "past success does not guarantee future results."		Tried it out for a couple weeks with a Roland RD300 and promptly returned it. Keyboard volume all but maxed (7/8ths) running mono out to the KB3. No way should something this large and heavy have so little volume. 60 watts thru 12" should make some noise in imo. The tone was very nice for keys but not that great (kinda bassy) for voice... but the real problem is that for it to be even close to anything you might consider "almost loud" the channel and main volumes had to be nearly maxed; and at that point the noise floor has been raised to the point of an ugly hiss. The weakest 60 watts I've ever worked with.		The KB3 has 5 star looks and features. Buy it if you need a Goliath sized practice amp but don't expect to keep up with a band or fill anything other than a small room. Luckily I bought it from an online dealer who also has local retail shops where I could make my return, Unfortunately they do not regularly stock this item so I could not hear it before buying or try another one to see if maybe I just got a lemon.
1,I bought this to run my laptop with Amplitube for live situations.  I am currently using my mbox2 and wanted something smaller.  The latency with this is audible.  It's not like you will have to run a test to see the latency, your brain will wonder why it does not hear sound after it hits the string.  I know there are a ton of ways to decrease latency on the computer but the fact is that I was running the mbox without problem.  Just to make sure I hooked it up to my desktop i7 2600k to see if that made a difference and it did not.		It seems some folks love this thing but I don't know how.		I did not check to see the latency if I were only recording so I suppose it could be ok for that.  I doubt it though.
1,Don't waste your money.	The strap feels like its made out of awkward paper/cardboard crappy fabric, and the holes aren't large enough to fit either of my guitars.  Spend the extra 4 bucks and get an actual decent strap.		EDIT: I cut the holes with scissors slightly to make the holes larger so it fits around for me now.  Still a very low quality strap but, if you have that issue like me, its somewhat fixeable. No idea if it'll last at all.
1,3 position switch was frozen. sent back.	the knobs are very small for adjustments.
1,Just like someone else has posted, their is no shielding on this cable.  I plugged it into a small Marshall practice amp and got a lot of noise.  Switched to my old cable and it's gone, so no doubt about it there is no shielding.
1,Poor product
1,I've bought a bunch of these over the last few years and 75% of them have gone bad within 2 years.  They simply don't last.  Get something better.
1,I purchased the Gator bag as I wanted a rain cover for my Mackie SRM-450's as I have 7 of them and use 4 of them outdoors. The Gator website does not show an actual picture of the "hideaway" rain cover. The rain cover is is great, the bag is not. I have purchased 7 of the Mackie bags which I give 5 stars and would like to purchase 4 Gator rain covers but at the $58.84 price to throw away the bag to keep the cover seems like I should just buy a few plastic garbage bags.
1,I've had this tuner for three years.  The tuner function works fine.  It is supposed to supply up to 200 mA of DC power to other pedals, but that almost never works.  Well it worked once or twice, but hasn't work since.  It wouldn't even power a pedal with a 7 mA draw.  Everything else about the pedal is nice.  I've seen others posting about the same problem, so the poor design earns them a one star.  Maybe some real world testing before releasing it into the wild would have helped.
1,Not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do.  Limited dynamic range.  But, it works.  Wish I'd have gotten something a little nicer though.
1,i have a total of 2 in and 4 out...they wroked GREAT the first time...now they don't work at all!
1,Extremely difficult to use. 100+ page instruction manual does not explain many of the bugs in it, for example why it won't record with the internal microphone at times. Different tracks record at different volumes inexplicably. Uses a proprietary file format that cannot be used with other recording software unless it is exported as a wav file. You have to use a USB hookup for that.  No support from company. Emailed them three times for an AC adapter; No response. Eats batteries. One set of batteries is enough to record maybe one song. Don't waste your money.
1,Required a lot of sanding to make it fit on my Fender American Standard Stratocaster.
1,good software but not a lot of extras
1,Just received this item today.  Unscrewed the back plate to put in 3 AA batteries.  Turned it on.  Immediately discovered two keys broken.  No sound at all from the high A and the high D sounded a D# instead.		I know it's just a toy, but I purchased it with full intention of using it on recordings.  It doesn't really come with three different organ sounds, but three octaves of the same organ sound.  The lowest one sounds best.  Vibrato is decent, not great.		Anyway, since mine came conveniently pre-broken, I'll be returning it.  Not sure if I'm interested in trying another one at this point or just going to get a refund.		This was disappointing.
1,Bought this product and quite frankly i did not like that it is made out of plastic.  It is better to save money and buy the adj slim par.
1,Feels  awkward in my hand, I never use it!
1,Their quality control must be slipping.  The unwound stings (e, b, g) each have 3 or 4 tiny black deposits that feel like raised, scratchy bumps or grains of sand on the strings.  They do not scrape off easily, either.  I have never seen this on guitar strings before.  If you are sliding your fingers up or down the strings, you definitely feel them.  They are an unnecessary distraction from the playing experience as well as uncomfortable.
1,It's a toy.  Don't do it.  Rent or buy from a local music store.
1,I really tried to like the product, inexpensive but not ideal.  A little bit of static in headphones from device.  The worst part was the little tiny opening that you have to use a needle-nose pliers to remove a tiny little connector to switch from mono to stereo.  Just that alone was worth a 1 star but I thought I'd be nice and give it 2.  Rolls, change that one thing and I could handle the little static because I'm sure that is fixable, but that tiny connector and opening...yeesshh!  That is/was a PAIN!!  I returned this and spent a little more money on the Behringer P16.
1,Completely dried out a couple of days after opening. Useless Junk. Save your money.  You've been warned. Totally useless product.
1,Love the lightweight design, easy adjustments, response and sound of it. The one screw design is also something I always prefer in ligatures. I don't want to have to fiddle with it more than I need to. However, and it's a big con, if you're using a mouthpiece made from hard rubber, the cylindrical tubes at the top of ligature, where the screw goes through will eventually dig it and make a dent in your mouthpiece. Not only does it mean than fine tuning it will be rendered more difficult as the ligature will tend to fall into the grooves it dug into the rubber but it will also damage your mouthpiece. Not worth getting.
1,Was pretty fast shipping but the strings make a strange sound. When you play you can hear an extra sound that shouldn't be there.
1,Well, they're bongos, I guess, but the diameter is wrong and these are honestly the worst natural skins I have ever come across.		I suspect that the many positive reviewers have never owned a natural-skin drum before, or else they're buying them for a child's toy.		These are bad bongos that look like good bongos in  a picture.
1,it was the wrong size for the bass that I wanted it for.
1,Did not fit my Epiphone Les Paul. not even close.
1,There is slop, but I expected that, so I'm not disappointed.  It just makes for a little more work.	If it's needed I'll explain slop: You back off the string tension and nothing happens, a little more and a lot happens.  You then need to start tightening.  I can live with it.
1,may have been something i did...not too sure but after the first use the thing broke >:( blah blah blah
1,I have a Samson headset, thought this would be the best way to go. The black one was just dust.	No form, just dust. the others are tight to get on, it is easy to tear. the	Hisonic Headset/Lavalier Microphone are the same thing in another package.
1,The silver bolt's has internal threading to attach onto a smaller black bolt that is affixed to the clamp.  The issue is that the threading goes the same way - so when unscrewing the silver part comes off and you have to get pliers to get it out of your mic mount.  This makes it a hassle to deal with on the road or if you ever have to move your mic.
1,These are not designed to fit a 301/4 scale bass.	They were short on the small diameter size by about an inch.	Therefore, the strings buzzed at the first fret because the diameter was too small at the nut.	Don't buy them, I wasted $16.00
1,Hair puller...not long enough, waste of money.
1,I'm a big fan of D'Addario bass strings. I have Nickel Rounds on my P-Bass and Flatwound Chromes on my Jazz. I bought this set to replace the tapewound flats that came on my Violin Bass. Violin basses are shortscale and naturally thumpy, so I bought these hoping to brighten things up a bit.		I was disappointed in the tone because it was so dark and thumpy. I don't know if I received a defective set but they were only slightly brighter than the tapewounds I replaced. The strings also felt rougher than my Nickel Rounds. They're definitely quieter in terms of finger noise but the nickels were surprisingly easier to slide on.		At first I thought maybe Violin Basses would have this tone no matter what strings I used. To check this I replaced the half rounds with some Chromes, and what a change it made! It really made the bass sing. They were warm and mellow but still had enough brightness. The Chromes had better sustain, increased output and really made the pickups sound good.		I don't think I'll try half rounds again. If I want something with a lot of punch to really cut through I'll get rounds. Otherwise I'll stick with D'Addario Chromes. Even though they are flats, they're incredibly versatile. They work with a lot of different styles and have a much greater range than these half rounds.
1,Holes for strap pins are too small for normal acoustic guitar.  When stretching the holes to fit ever so slightly the "leather" rips and begins to separate.		Poorly designed and lacking quality.
1,Fender monogrammed pattern stitched onto a cheapo beginner strap.  Thin, scratchy, stiff, poly material.  I have a couple of these Fender Monogrammed strats, they have leather backing.  Wanted to get another like them.  I guess they don't make them anymore.  The stock picture shows a leather backing like they are supposed to have.  But the one sent to me was certainly not leather.  Maybe this is a cheap chinese knockoff?  Who knows...		Luckily Amazon is awesome and I was able to return it for a full refund.
1,I bought a set of 3 regular light gauge (.10) strings.  When I went to install the low E string, it must have been defective, because there was hardly any tension on the string I was winding when it broke just before the saddle.  I have included a picture of the break as a customer picture.  I was able to replace it with the low E string from the next set, however I'm still out a set of strings.  It isn't worth the hassle to return the pack, so I'm keeping them, but this'll probably be the last time I purchase from this brand.
1,Does not work with senheiser wireless lavilier systems! No doubt it is wired slightly different then what I needed for my application. However I was unable to output ANY audio to my mixer when using this product...mono nor stereo output worked. Returned for a full refund! Look elsewhere
1,returned for credit. did not do what i had hoped for. it did not fit my strap buttons so i sent it back.
1,Disclaimer: I've played the guitar for almost 40 years.  I've also informally taught for many of those years.		I ran across this device on a guitar belonging to a friend's daughter.  As many reviewers have said, it didn't fit well and had to keep being re-adjusted.		But most importantly, it won't really help you actually learn to play the guitar.  It allows you to practice strumming and picking notes with your picking hand.  However, the fretting hand learns nothing.  You will not learn any notes or chord shapes or get any practice fretting the strings at all.  It's also very limited, allowing you to play only 4 simple chords.		It's only for the most basic beginner and I believe it would stunt your growth as a musician if you were to use it for more than a week.  And it's pretty expensive for that very short lifetime.
1,did not work for what I needed
1,Horrible hum.  Sent it back and bought a Fishman Loudbox mini - awesome amp.
1,doesn't work
1,A nice enough cable, BUT it slips out of the input jack on my electric piano. I've never had any other cables do this, so I'm pretty sure it's the cable and not the jack (also, I see other reviewers have occasionally noticed similar things). It's slipped out a few times in the middle of gigs, so I'm going to try to get my money back, but my hopes are not high!
1,Out of using this wireless microphone system, I get feedback with the sound not turned up, and also, you can't say anything right over the mic when speaking to the crowed. Horrible mics, get a shure microphone. They are better, and they don't give you feedbacks than this crappy system here.
1,The price is right but it's a really cheap board. The pedals are plastic. It feels cheap because it is cheap. The wah pedal is just crap. You have to use an external wah or external controller. It's prone to breakage as well due to poor build quality. I finally gave up and bought a much nicer PEAK MIDI fcb4x which is much smaller, built like a tank and has a large LCD display to tell you which patch you are on!!! They are on sale for $245 on the PEAK midi web site. I don't know why they are so much more expensive here on amazon.
1,As far as I can tell, it is useless, if you tighten it enough to stay put it completely mutes the sound, if anybody knows a trick to using this thing please tell me, but as far as I can tell it is just as lame as the agogo bell mount...
1,Based on the number of positive reviews, I bought the 20ft right angle version of this product to use with my Fender Jazz bass.  When I received the cable, I was a little concerned about the light gauge and feel of the cable.. but hey, it got great reviews.. so why not?  I used the cable last night and my signal faded ... repeatedly.  I wiggled the cable and got the signal back, then it happened again.. no signal.  I pulled out several of my backup cables and tried them all and had no loss of signal or cut-off.  I tried this cable again.  Same loss of signal.  I'm returning this cable, as I can't even recommend this product as a backup cable since it is unreliable.
1,the limiter didn't even work. The enhancer worked but was crap to begin with.
1,There isn't a quality issue here, but one of simply not liking the product. It's one of taste. But, if you're looking for a full, round, mellow tone, these aren't what you want. They're too hard. They produce a loud percussive noise - no worse than any other thick pick, but no better, as I'd been hoping, and a nylon pick gives you more of a mellow sound, with less treble. I just don't see the point to these. Any plastic pick will serve you just as well, and any nylon pick better, if you're after what I was.
1,noisy
1,Despite a call to DigiTech which netted their assurances that it would work for our needs prior to purchasing this unit from Amazon, this harmonizer warbles and fails across the board in octaves C5 and up. It's also sensitive to sounds coming through the PA monitors and through the mains in a live situation and gets "confused". We tried running it through various configurations to try to get it to work, but nothing solved its issues. Even below C5, if there are other instruments or other singers, it fails to  stay on pitch, even for octaves, never mind thirds and fifths. I think that for studio work for the solo artist who is an alto or baritone, it might be okay, but certainly not for a soprano or mezzo soprano.
1,Frankly I did not like the design of the dispenser. Prefer vacuum packed strings. I have six guitars, I change my guitar strings simultaneously each month. I think in this case comes to damaging moisture easily release them the ropes yet. Dispenser design really bad, hard to pull some strings that's not good, it hurts, buy this package by mistake, I'm sorry
1,These would not work in any city I visited, there was constant static.
1,Strings feel nice, easy on my fingers which helps a lot since I'm just starting to play. Sound quality is good, not much more I can say about the sound since I am a beginner and won't pretend to be a guru or anything about that. As for the longevity of the strings, maybe I just got a defective string, but the #1 string (high e) broke rather quickly. The rest of the strings are still fine. I'm just disappointed that it broke so quickly, it didn't even last as long as my previous strings even though it boasts that it lasts 3x longer.
1,update: I liked the unit initially. The overall construction was decent, however its internal components and design seem to be lacking. I originally thought I was going to be able to deal with its built in microphone for sound activation, but I could not. It cannot handle loud low frequencies at all, and the mic sensitivity cannot be adjusted. This causes the sound activation to just quickly jump from bank to bank, scene to scene, etc. This visually does not look well at all. I returned this and went with the ADJ 384 DMX model. The ADJ can handle the changes in sound volume dynamically. Thats a big win for me! For 50 bucks more, you get 12 chases, this EMB only has 6. You get 32 channels, where this has only 16. Its a no brainer! Plus the ADJ has a Joystick for pan and tilt assignment!!!! So if you are just looking for a cheap controller for an entertainment, this EMB will do, but I think mobile DJs and small clubs / lounges should avoid this. This EMB hates bass heavy music, so if you want to use this with bass music in your entertainment room? Avoid it.
1,I had the same problem as  Walter Klisiwecz (below) with an OMCPA4.  These are just a little too small and don't stay put.  The ball portion is also quite bulbous and looks funny sticking up past the bridge compared to the much flatter Marin default pin tops.  Moreover, on close examination, I found them to be identical the much lower priced Blisstime Bridge pins set I already have (https://www.amazon.com/Blisstime-Guitar-Bridge-Replacement-Abalone/dp/B00UTELPGK).
1,Had to take ends off and re-solder to stop hum.  Didn't expect this from Fender, must be from the Chinese division.
1,Knobs came chipped. Very unsightly. Not worth doing a return for a $9 item. I've had too many issues with Musiclily. This was the last straw. No more from this company!
1,I ordered 2 of these stands.  The first one didn't stay up when I tightened it.  I tried the 2nd stand and it seemed to work OK but they are very cheaply made so I sent them both back for a refund.
1,Ordered TAN color strap, received reddish brown instead.
1,Comes from China. I'm sure it's composed of all kinds of harmful toxins. And it takes over a month to receive it. Kum Pow!
1,Height is not adjustable.  For the price it is not acceptable.
1,Not impressed....sounded mechanical among other things

It's already cracked and I basically am babying the thing.  I don't use the retractable handle to "tip" the unit when pulling.  It's too much torque for the plastic handle with the heavy PA in it.  It's really a shame as the case is much improved otherwise as stated in my original review (below).  If I had to replace this again I would be going with something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gator-PA-Transport-Series-G-PA-TRANSPORT-SM-Speaker-Case/dp/B007BXI55Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gator PA Transport Series G-PA TRANSPORT-SM Speaker Case</a>.  I wish I had seen it before as it's only about $13.00 more.  While unreviewed, the slightly larger version of the same case has a couple of 5-star reviews.		***********************************************************************************************************************	Original:	I purchased this carrying case to replace the old one which broke in a similar fashion to what is described in other reviews.  This one is much the same with a couple of parts improved from the previous version of the same model.  The zippers on the old one never wore out or had any problems, lasting beyond the deterioration of the the prop-thingy on the bottom of the case, the handle on top, and finally the retractable pulling-handle.		The once-flimsy carrying-handle is now vastly improved, being stitched in. (It doesn't look like it's going anywhere.)  The retractable pulling-handle looks a little sturdier as well.  I will be babying this thing a lot more anyway.  For the price, I guess it's a good value.  The previous one lasted a few years with very moderate use in and out of a van with my senior adults.  For the money, it sure beats carrying all of the components around separately and it's a good bit improved since the earlier reviewed version.		If you're gigging really hard with this thing, you might consider a third-party case that's sturdier as this won't hold up to super abusive handling.  That being said, most users who purchase a portable all-in-one system such as this aren't going to be gigging really hard anyway.
1,It was too small for my Shure microphones!
1,when they spin and blink to the music their pretty cool. but they didn't want to spin when you turned them on. I had to help them get started  not good for DJing
1,Shiitty pick
1,ok
1,I get that this is a cheap guitar, so I wasn't expecting high quality, but it's as if no one even bothered to make sure it was playable. The intonation is waaaaay off. The tuning pegs slip, and the strings that are on it must be 10s, and I'd say this short scale needs at least 12s on it because 10s are way too sloppy. I will say that the pick-ups are nice and hot.
1,NO Truss rod, No Fret Markers,Nut and Bridge was junk, Finish was like it was done outside in a sandstorm,Only after replacing the nut,Bridge,strings,Filing the frets, Did it even sound like a guitar able for a student, If you think this is a good deal, Sorry to say it's NOT.
1,Really inferior quality. All 3 of the cables started to malfunction within a few uses. I've had/used other coiled cables (Radio Shack) that have held up. These didn't.
1,I read both the good and bad reviews and decided to take a chance on these.		In the end, these bags were made even more cheaply than I initially expected, and that is taking into account I paid only ~$50-60 for the whole set. They are nylon, but not in the fabric sense, in the "these are pretty much oversized shower caps" sense of a nylon product. That is the main distinction I would make. They are very thin and hardly protect drums from scratches or bumps. Two of them are already ripped from sliding them into my truck. They are a little bit of a hassle to get on the drums, too. It's almost better to leave them off and not trick your brain into thinking the drums are protected as you carry and pack them into the car.		On another note, Beato makes a higher tier of drum bags that are fairly decent. My friend has them, and although they are ripping in some areas, they have withstood years of abuse. I was naive in thinking I was getting a "slightly" cheaper version of his drum bags when I ordered these.
1,Works great. However on mine, the threads on the pipe were too deep and the pipe actually went beyond the bottom of the base when screwed in completely. It was easy enough to fix with a hacksaw, but it really shouldn't have been necessary. I'm guessing this isn't a common issue since I don't see other complaints about it.		Otherwise it's fine. There are rubber feet on the base to protect the surface it's on. It's heavy enough to feel sturdy. The stickers people complain about came off easily and completely with some water, soap, and magic eraser. It fits standard microphone threads.		Having to saw off part of it means it looses 2 stars. Otherwise it would be 4 stars
1,It seems functional enough for mitigating plosives but the screen on mine wasn't stretched taut so it was looks all lumpy and a total eyesore. Poor quality control.
1,Absolutely did not function at all upon arrival. I called tech support, they said model was no longer being made, couldn't help, sorry. Do not buy from whoever  is selling this product, just roll down your window and throw away money, same thing.
1,Does not work well with OS X Yosemite, and it is like pulling teeth to get customer support for this product.
1,first this only covers 1 instrument and a gemini VHF 2100 covers 2	second Nady intentionally installs an resistor/cap/attenuator to stop mic from working on this model (because they charge more for one	that a microphone will work on..).	gemini 2001 can handle instrument or microphone ! I thought Nady was better because all the reviews and (it costs more ...)	I ended up with more feedback probs and interference from emp with this model as well.	*bottom line* buy the frikn gemini and get 2 instruments OR Mics for less than what you pay for this...
1,I have a relatively light amp -- a Supersonic 22W combo -- and mine broke. Now I have to pay $10 for another that will probably also break unless i am really careful?
1,I don't think the reed gards hold the reeds well enough, so I actually use a Vandoren case for serious business, but I own the red and green Rico ones that only hold two reeds each because they fit in my bag and if I forget the other one and have to open a new reed, I can put it away temporarily in the case.  Other people I know use biology class glass with a rubber band and swear by it!  Go figure!
1,Very cheaply made. I am sorry I bought them. I would not recommend them to anyone. I am ordering some other bags from a competitor and for around the same price.
1,Cheap and weird feeling. odd size.
1,This thing just changes your tone too much and is a little noisey and I would not record or play live with this because of that.  It does provide a vibe and chorus effect, but at the expensive of your tone.
1,I returned this item.  I did not like it and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Behringer is a great brand im not knocking the brand just this product.
1,I have used other ChromaCast products in the past and have been very happy with them.	I bought this stand less than six months ago, and it has sat gently in its little package until I needed it for a gig tonight.	I took it out of its bag and started to put it together, and the thing is already broken.		Either I was sold a used item (I bought it NEW), or it is defective.	There is a nut missing that allows the telescoping pieces to fit together, and it looks like someone forced the two pieces together, breaking off a tab which is required for it to stay in place.		Basically what I have now is an utterly useless pile of pieces which are good for nothing unless they send me replacement parts.		Alas, I have no way to contact the company to see about achieving this.		As I said, ChromaCast stands have been great for all my instruments and music stands--I have been a fan. Until now.
1,I purchased this at the same time as I purchased a Behringer microphone. The combination was noisy and even with the gain reduced to zero, pulsed and made a cycling sound. Whether this was caused by the microphone or the mixer was impossible to tell as I didn't have an alternative for either so as to swap them out. Because of this I returned both of them. My uncertainty is why I am giving both products two stars.		I am unlikely to purchase another Behringer product, even though others have had some good reviews and will probably go with one of the competition.		I must say that Amazon accepted the return without question and refunded my money. I don't often return products, but when I do I'm pleased with this company's attitude. (When I returned something because I screwed up, I did have to pay a small fee for shipping and handling, but that seems absolutely fair.) So while I gave both the microphone and the mixer two stars, I do give Amazon five stars.
1,Bad advertise, got fooled
1,Did not work with unit  and  returned it only to get a credit  34 cents. :/
1,the design is pretty terrible.
1,I don't know what kind of guitar you would use this on, the holes are way too small for me to use on any of my guitars.
1,One word, FLIMSY.
1,Horrible. So much static.
1,junk
1,I have purchased a few sets of these strings recently, and in each case the red "low g" string has broken overnight...  DISAPPOINTING to say the least, esp. since the previous version of these strings (i.e., without the "red low g") were consistently excellent....  Changing string vendors if this doesn't get rectified.
1,I messed around with this thing for several hours, downloading software and trying over and over to get the thing to make some noise, any noise at all -- nothing!  I was very disappointed, and will return the machine to Guitar Center tomorrow.  As far as I can tell, you basically pay almost nothing for the keyboard, but then spend a small fortune buying the software and bundles.  Sounds like what happens with computer printers, where the machines are cheap but the ink is very expensive and gets used up far too fast...  I think I won't bother with any more MIDI controllers, and will instead save up and buy a synth.
1,Expensive throwaway for me. May work for others.
1,With all the great reviews I decided to purchase this for podcasting even though the price seemed cheap.		I was excited it came with an Xlr cable but was unfortunately built into the arm so removing it if it dies requires cutting and yanking it out.		I attached it to my desk and connected my Behringer c-3 mic and haven't touched it since. After a month and a half , the Xlr cable burned out and in the middle of a podcast this past week, the washer broke, the arm gave out , came off the desk, and smashed my $70 mic into the floor and crushed the condenser.		You get what you pay for I suppose.
1,I would have payed up to 20 or 30 above if the following happens:	1.-get a quality strap or, build is with bigger holes do clip on straps buckles can get Through. I'm thinking Daddario. Even the instructions suggest getting a strap lock. You have to end up buying more and more things.	2. Curve the back to make it like a belly cut.		I know the competition is 210 dollars more but that one comes with its own stand and getting one of that quality is also expensive.
1,This is not for a yamaha and the bottom legs are unstable
1,Came broken. Was going to replace but realized that it's junk anyway. Flimsy. It was super cheap so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.
1,Material isn't bad. Its a medium weight type bag. But one of the zippers broke the first time I used it... its still usable, but im not thrilled. I haven't had tome to contact the company as im gigging and travel a bunch.
1,ok
1,I like the hanger in every way except the mounting screws are way too short. Since the purpose of this hanger is to securely hold an instrument, having the proper screws is absolutely essential. I know it's easy to purchase and use different screws but if a product does not do what it is designed to do without modification, I don't think is should be rated above two stars. Supplying the right screws should be an obvious and easy fix.
1,well made, good price, but so SHORT the top of the rod doesnt even come to the top of my timbales...im having to go to HD to buy a much longer 3/8" rod, otherwise very nice
1,Didn't work for mr at all
1,I bought this pedal new, at a local music store. It worked good for one gig, then the switch broke. I wasn't mistreating it. I found it to be unreliable.
1,Were great for a year, and then the soldered joints started failing, one after the other.  Had to resolder every one of these. Ended up throwing them away after a while and now use EWI instead.  These might work OK for home studio or install use. Not for weekend warriors. So far so good, here's hoping...
1,At first, I thought it would be OK, but I soon discovered that between getting harps in and out, and working with its limited adjustments, surely there was something better. After trying the Hohner Harmonica MZ 2010 Flex Rack, though overpriced, I realized that the HH01 was a waste of time and money. However, if, by chance, its geometry fits your anatomy, and you want to struggle with changing harps, or perhaps only use one harp, some electrical tape on the pinch bars to avoid damage to harps and improve traction might make this a real bargain.
1,I purchased three of these units for my DJ company and one of them was defective right out of the box.  We had an intermittent problem with the defective unit as the aux input and the 1/4 inch right and left outputs would cut in and out.  There were no other issues on the defective unit and the RCA outputs worked well without problems.  If you have a reliable DDJSR component, you will enjoy the simplicity and easy mixing controls, beat matching, effects, and EQ's which work well with Serato DJ.		That being said, I'm still disappointed in the quality of this particular Pioneer.  I realize this is considered a mid-grade (at best) model, so I wouldn't expect the quality to be the highest.  However, I own a multi-unit DJ company and we expect our gear to be reliable.  I can't say that I completely trust the other two DDJSR components I still own.  We were hoping for an affordable switch to a more compact DJ unit. (Our older DJ units were using two Numark V7's, Serato Itch and an independent Numark mixer).		I have been told over and over again by peers that Pioneer is a superior brand to Numark but I'm just not convinced.  It's possible that this may be because I purchased lower grade models from Pioneer and higher grade models from Numark.  If I purchased a Pioneer DDJSX2, the quality would probably be much higher, however, the cost vs risk is too great for my company.		Additionally, we never had any issues with our old Numark V7's and they performed at hundreds of weddings.  Meanwhile, I have had to send back two Pioneer DDJSB2's and one DDJSR for being unusable right out of the box.  We're now going to try our luck on a Numark NVII by going back to the brand we worked with before (even if it is less known for being a superior brand).		As a side note - our components are always handled properly and we always use the appropriate Magma, Odyssey, or travel case needed for the component.		I hope Pioneer will take this review seriously and look hard at their quality control.  Every component they sell should work perfectly out of the box.  Intermittent problems are especially concerning.  Brides, venues, and other wedding vendors trust my company to be able to perform flawlessly at their "once in a lifetime" event and I expect the products I use to be nearly flawless.  It's the same expectation that my customers put on me and the people who work for me.  My DJ's and I can only be as good as our technology and the companies I trust.		Read through the other reviews and decide for yourself.  Maybe I got unlucky and purchased a few Pioneer lemons, but my honest recommendation is to either upgrade to a higher grade Pioneer (like the DDJSX) or go to another brand.  I'm not the only reviewer talking about early issues with this controller so I remain skeptical on its true reliability.
1,The sound is not as nice as my friends older original k240's. In fact I am not happy at all with these. The highs are slightly reed like and the lows are just not there. Well they are there but lacking the tone and depth of my other headphones. I'll break them in a little and see if that helps.
1,No good
1,Not loud enough...
1,I was very disappointed with this item. it sounded like one of those old am radios my dad use have
1,I bought these to use with a specific group I work with and the screens did not fit my mic heads. I was very disappointed. Thankfully I ordered a different brand at the same time which fit perfectly.
1,This is a terrible case. The first time out the internal frame broke and the bag was just dragging along which damaged the finish on my $6,500 speaker (Fulcrum Acoustics). Returned it and bought the factory bag without wheels made by Under Cover.
1,Falls over easy
1,Let me just start out by saying that I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. I still own most of these units except for this one...the JoYo compressor. My setup is a very simple one...starting with a Stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. I don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals I've tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them. This thing simply didn't work right out of the box. While the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from China. Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. I ended up sending it back for a full refund. I don't in anyway blame the seller. They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them again...just nothing with the name JoYo on it. If you're only buying these based on price I would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for.
1,Pretty neat pedal while it worked.  As someone else mentioned, it really would have been nice to be able to use tap tempo while in a preset. Really limits the usefulness of presets in my opinion, unless you don't play live. But then why would you need presets at all? My biggest issue with the pedal is the company behind it (Cherub Technologies). By the time I contacted the distributor about the dead pedal, it had been just over 6 months since purchase and they would not do anything at all for me. Tried contacting the manufacturer, but after multiple emails and voice messages I've received absolutely no response AT ALL.  Apparently there is no warranty on their products. You will find NO mention of any warranty on their website, nor a word about warranty in their product documentation. Basically buy at your own risk and if it fails, discard and find something else. Interesting that they put the CE mark on the product that indicates they are in compliance with international standards that do include product warranty requirements.
1,If these were meant for a lapel mic, you would have a very hard time finding a lapel mic that was that big.  if there was one that big I doubt anyone would want to use it since it would be like taping a Quarter to your lapel!		NOT for  a Lapel Mic!		Headset Yes!
1,This is a very poor design.  The on button is prominent and so the tuner can be accidenty turned on.  This would be ok if it had a timed shut off after a few mins,  but it doesn't.  So the battery is flat when you need to tune up, very frustrating.
1,Not a great stand, don't trust it for my electric, but it does work for my acoustic because of the thicker body.
1,Wanted to put on top of Shure Sm58's to help identify mics from the distant soundboard, and does not work. Pretty cheap, thin, and though they fit over the windscreen, they do not have any elastic at the base so they do not stay on. In fact, so loose, they fall off the mics. They also detract from the look. I ended up using colored electrical tape to mark the mics, and that works much better, and looks much better. Save your $13!
1,Received broken in two pieces right out of the box.  Not recommended
1,My biggest character flaw is thinking I'm can get something good for less money. That and I am gullible. DO NOT think you are going to get a mic that is as good as a Shure SM58 for $20. You can't. Don't believe the reviews, this mic is not in the same league as an SM58. It took me about 30 seconds after receiving the item to hook it up and realize this is not that good. I'm a slow learner, this is the third "just as good as the sm58" mic I've tried. None of them even come close. Save your money and buy the Shure, the is no substitute.
1,has a rough edge which cuts my neck.
1,It works..but couldn't get any sound from the 1/8 jack. I played it through my amp and it sounded tinny ..not much bass. I finally unplugged then just played my guitar through my amp without it..I'm like...why am I messing around with this stupid thing?? It's sounds awful. Sent it back.
1,It is nice mixer with 100 effects like reverb etc and it is nice. It is small and compact so it can fit in a small bag. I am still learning how to use it to get the best sound out of it. I don't have any complaints. It is a great buy!	**Update** As with all Behringer equipment I found out that 2 of the channels aren't working for some reason had to purchase another one. Sounded great while it lasted though.
1,I purchased the Morley ABY splitter so I could use my amp (Marshall DSL  only one input) to drive two instruments and so I could move quickly from my guitar to my steel. My 2 rating of the Morley splitter is due to its inability to handle a wireless input source properly. When you're using the A and B switching option (both instruments are hot) and one of the two instruments is wireless, attenuation/volume loss is in the neighborhood of 80% for the instrument connected via a traditional instrument cable. Also, when using two instruments, both connected via traditional instrument cable inputs, and you're using the same A and B switching option, there is still a noticeable reduction in volume (imo: 10% loss). From what I can tell, when using two instruments, both connected via traditional instrument cable inputs, and you're using the A or B switching option, there is no noticeable loss of volume or tone. Ive performed extensive troubleshooting just to make sure these issues were not caused by a faulty cable or instrument (single coil vs humbucker, etc.). So, I cycled three of my guitars (American Deluxe Strat  single & double coils; Les Paul; Peavey PowerSlide lap steel  also single/double coil) through the different input channels. All scenarios produced the same result as mentioned above.
1,I honestly don't understand what people who give this a good review are talking about. You don't have to be an audiophile to hear that this awful device doesn't do any of the things the makers claim it does. Sure, forty bucks is way too little for anything stellar, but this unit actively destroys recordings. The hissing and buzzing has been mentioned. If you own a decent high end microphone and want it to sound like a five dollar crap toy, by all means, invest in this horrible, horrible device from an otherwise competent manufacturer.
1,Absolutely doesn't work. Clamps were bent and didn't sit right. Scratched my neck. Low and high e strings were just muted.
1,Works fine with narrow combos, but you are going to need to look elsewhere if you have a mesa boogie wide body combo amplifier.
1,Didn't work at all, no sound.
1,Very disappointed. My guitars nearly fall backward in these racks as compared to more sturdier models with no neck support. Also the botom pegs which support the guitar SPINS as it is not welded on. Will buy NO MORE of these.
1,I just did not like the feel of these and did not notice a tonal improvement.
1,It worked great for less than 2 months, then the silent plug started failing and now doesn't work at all. It still makes a connection, but the silent feature, which was the entire reason I purchased this cable since I already have plenty of regular, non silent cables, doesn't work at all any more. Bummer, I saw the words "Mogami" and "Neutrik" and thought I was getting quality, but I guess it's only as good as it's put together. Shame, because before the silent plug failed I was considering buying 2 more cables, but I'm glad I didn't get around to it, because even the cheapest cables out there last more than 2 months. I could never justify spending this kind of money for a cable that fails after 2 months. I originally gave this cable a 5 star review but I had to change it when the silent plug became not silent.
1,This is an affordable copy of the Boss Harmonist pedal. I bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature. But was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.	 Anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay. And on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem, hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise. Also the pedal just started oscillating a few times. I would have given the Behringer us600 five stars if it kept working, it tracked nice and didn't tone suck too bad.
1,I purchased a set of these already knowing that I don't like Ernie Ball sTeel strings, but now I don't like Ernie Ball nylon strings either. The g-string is the flattest, dullest sounding I've ever heard. In its defense, the 3 wound strings sounded marvelous, but 3 out of 6 isn't good by my standard. Don't waste your money with these unless you are stringing a guitar for someone you don't like.
1,Tried with 3 different guitars. Will not recognize a B string, shows that its a half tuned A. Verified the B tuning on another tuner.	Such a shame, this tuner is small and compact. Returning this tuner and buying a Snark.
1,To bulky and awkward. They tend to bend out of shape and feel warped. I had to file them to a taper.
1,looks very nice when get it but after a couple uses start loosing the little mirror squares, they are attached to the ball with a very low quality glue,not recomend to buy it.
1,I bought these in May- I just placed them into a guitar and when I tried to press the knobs onto the pot, the shaft of the pot separated from the body of the pot. Effectively the pot dismantled itself - snapping itself in two. This initially happened with 1 of the pots. I thought perhaps the knob was the wrong size- perhaps I was using an inch knob on a metric pot. So I tried a metric knob on the second pot. WHAM- trying to force the knob down on the pot snapped the second pot in two the exact same way. I used vice grips on a third one to "clamp" the split shaft - hoping it would make the shaft smaller but to no avail. Upon investigation, NONE OF MY MANY STYLES OF KNOBS work on these pots - the knurled area is simply too large, even when the split area is clamped completely together. Also, I have never, ever seen a pot snap apart like the two I encountered.		I bought 8 of these based on the reputation of CTS, but now I'm disgusted. I'm not sure if I got some counterfeit pieces or what. But I got them in May and now I can't return them =(. This totally sucks.
1,This strap was a disappointment.  It's padded nice but it's bouncy.  It's elastic so it stretches from the weight of your guitar and will bungee up and down.
1,Already down. Got it March 11, 2018. On March 28 while singing it through it the sound changed. Lot of noise now. Wasn't dropped. Was on a boom arm off of computer desk. Had it hooked up to a Boss VE-20 Vocal processor Loop Station. 48 v Phantom power needed to run the microphone. It had low mic volume. I had to sing right on mic to be heard. Sounded good at first till it popped without reason.
1,I have a solid body Hofner 30 inch scale bass and the E string went past the blue thread winding when laid flat.  I tried it anyway and sure enough, every time I would get it tuned up to about a. C#, another turn of metal winding would peel away. Nothing on the Hofner, or La Bella web site indicates that 30 inches isn't universal across all models.
1,Will not buy this one not good
1,Will not stay in tune to save it's life after 2-3 transitions between E-D.Worthless in a pro situation be it live or in the studio. Uninstalled and threw into the garbage.
1,Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for a better one.  It's basically just a cover and doesn't offer much protection.
1,I like the V12 reeds better.
1,Right out of the bag, we could see how shabbily made it was.  The E string broke as we started to turn it (we are professionals, this shouldn't happen with normal action).  Replacing the E string was difficult due to the strange setup with the endpin.  The action was terrible, no matter where the bridge was located.  We want a full refund and an apology for selling such a crappy instrument.
1,What junk. It picks up any sound and as soon as you turn the volume up on your amp even a tiny bit, you will get a blasted by a shriek of feedback.		DO NOT use the adhesive tape they provide unless you want the thing stuck on your instrument forever...or risk destroying your instrument by ripping it off. i tested on an old ukulele.
1,I tried these strings as a potential alternative to the more costly Elixir strings that I have been using for my flattop.  I was very disappointed with both the sound and the longevity of these strings.  I have returned to the Elixir brand.
1,It broke the first time I used it. what a piece of junk. Really, stay away from this. It's a scam. Faulty by desing, a very thin plastic part is supposed to support all the effort, and it obviously breaks. I really hate this thing.
1,doesn't do anything for my set at all.
1,I bought these because heck a capo is just some metal, rubber and a spring. You can't mess that up right? Wrong... these have no curve to accommodate the radius bend of a neck and worse than that, the spring and clamping of this thing is not good. If I put it on and then press the two end together, it will work OK, but try and put it on lime a real capo and it will not be holding your strings down for beans.
1,I received a pick totally different from the picture. It is a dunlop but not this type. just wasted my time.
1,The illustrations for this in the ad make it seem like the pattern covers a wide expanse; unless you're hanging it from 12 or 15 feet, it really doesn't, and quite honestly, comes off as quite hokey. I thought you could control the patterns, such that if you found one you liked, you could freeze it and leave it be. Not so. There are two modes; manual, which automatically changes the pattern, and audio, which changes the pattern per beat from music. There is a sensitivity knob, but that really just controls how fast the patterns change. And speaking of the patterns, I like the full on dots mode, but after that, it circulates through a bunch of straight line patterns, that for me were frankly boring.		Sadly, I'm returning my unit. As some reviewers said, it might be good for a fun party at home, a faux disco night event or something, I have no qualms about that and don't mean to disparage Chauvet at all, but forget about it for a DJ show with more than a couple dozen people, or band performance, you'd get laughed at...
