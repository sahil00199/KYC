0,I party with this song all the time!!
0,This is one of the best thrash metal albums ever and it's just raw and powerful totally recomend this to any old school metallica fan or any metal fan in general. But I can't put this ahead of Master Of Puppets.
0,If you're tired of the standard covers of this Leonard Cohen song, check this one out. It's got a little bit of blues in it, a touch of country twang, and while Ricky Z's voice could be stronger, it's obvious he's not just singing this one by rote.
0,Love it
0,Great song!
0,My kids love it
0,I rate this Christmas Cd highly and one of the reason's is it's not just David cassidy singing lead on most of the traditional tunes but Shirley Jones also doing the leads. Shirley has such a voacl range as she has shown early in her career as when she was young in movies like Oklahoma. It also has that partridge family 1970's feeling so if you were a fan back in those bell bottomed pants and big hair-do days buy this cd. It's a Christmas cd and it makes you feel good around the holidays even if you are finished Christmas shopping you can always buy it now and open it up as a christmas gift to yourself next Christmas.
0,Another awesome hit!!
0,Great music at great prices !

0,My five year old grandson absolutely ADORES this song - and I adore watching him sing and dance to it :) Makes me smile EVERY time!
0,This song is awesome to dance too and sing along with at parties or even long car rides along.  Up beat rhythm and all; you can't go wrong!
0,very pleased
0,Why aren't we, the body, all Christ avails to us to the suffering world?  I long that we believer's in Christ would live out the meaning of this song.
0,Take well written music,  the golden pipes of Bill Withers and the magic in the recording process you have a Masterpiece like this.	Compare this great music with new stuff, it blows the Autotuner crowd out of the water.
0,I had never heard this song before.  It is refreshing to hear a completely new Christmas song.  Two vocalists trade off on this piece (female and male), accompanied by guitar, drum, strings orchestration, and clarinet here and there (I believe).  There's also an blues-style electric organ in the background.		The rhythm is good and pretty evenly paced throughout.  Interesting mix of classical strings, acoustic guitar, blues electric organ and a jazzy clarinet. Each providing a light touch of different genres. Who would have thought of putting this all together and that it would blend well. I like the voices, the male voice is baritone and has a slightly rough edge that is an interesting contrast to his female counterpart (and doesn't sound like all the other male voices I've heard). This could easily have been a non-Christmas piece.		If you like country, or blues and/or light rock, I think you would enjoy this a lot.
0,This entire album is amazing.  If you are new to Third Day's music, this collection has some of their most loved songs.  Personal favorites include:  "Lift Up Your Face", "Make Your Move", "Children of God", "Surrender", "Trust In Jesus", "Follow Me There" and "Sound of Your Voice".  I would recommend this album to everyone.  Very well written songs, amazing vocals, awesome arrangements.  This will quickly become one of your favorite albums to have on repeat.

0,Song from the movie Legally Blonde, I believe. Fun lyrics and Hoku does a beautiful job with this youthful, adventurous song.
0,My uncle and the record of the Sons of The Pioneers listened to it for many years just become one of my favorites of course over the years I always meant to	ask him if i could have it but never did when he passed I was unable to go so I didn't have a chance to get it hunted for awhile then gave up was happy to find on Amazon along with my other favorites of times gone by .

0,Young folks seem to love to party and drink out of red solo cups. I heard this song and thought it is a young person's anthem, so I rushed home and downloaded from Amazon. Big hit around here.
0,Great Music!!!
0,I've always loved this song and I love the fact that most of Amazon's songs are only .99 each, so I don't have to buy the entire album and get songs I either don't like or have never heard of.
0,I love this CD and by far the best from Gary Allan.  A favorite country singer from years past, and well worth listening to for those not familiar with his songs.

0,Cute song.
0,Great.
0,Love
0,hauntingly realistic -although, I know this classic song-I found it unrecognizable-this version takes it to a higher level-great song-rhythmic like the struggle between the cradle and the grave-and urban decay-so, poignant because of untimely death of Paul Walker-I could listen to it a thousand times-
0,An Oldie but a Good one!
0,Classic Song added to my Library
0,One night in 1991 I lay down on the floor with my big headphones on and listened to this song. I had a musical epiphany because I was really locked in to Paul's bass. It was almost like I was hearing it for the first time, especially on the fade out chorus. I'd always appreciated his playing, but this time it really hit me how great it truly is.	I love when John's vocals take on that faraway hue on 'cellophane flowers...', it's like OK, Dorothy opened the door from her black and white world and entered the colorful land of Oz. Well, in this song, we start out already in Oz and on the cellophane part we open a door into an even more amazing land - John's imagination! This is psychedelic pop at its best. Alice in Wonderland, woooo!
0,Another favorite song of mine Chicago has been around since the 70s and still rocks with their hard rock melodies for the past 30 years and stil  going strong today
0,Best Christmas Album ever recorded
0,Great song.
0,The disco era did have some good songs, most had to much bass to them, Halls and Oates had some very good songs and despite what the rockers said this pair were good.
0,arrived in good shape
0,Jewel was at the very tail end of her 20s in 2003 when her fourth album "0304" was released.  But the photos that adorn the CD's layout -- oh my!  She is more gorgeous and youthful in them than girls 10 years her minor.  She has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world in fact.  She is the living definition of "young and smart and sexy," to use the catchphrase she coined for this album.		OK, so I've just now been open about my admiration for Jewel's looks, but the question is, does she have the music to back it up?  The answer is an unequivocal "yes."		Some reviewers considered "0304" to be something of a misstep for the Alaskan born singer/songwriter, but I believe this to be one of her best albums.  The opener "Stand" is a classic.  It always brings me back to the first times that I heard this CD.  One of her best ever.  It and the other songs here demonstrate Jewel's knack for making odd references in her lyrics (see also the one to Charlie Sheen in "Intuition") that put a smile on the listener's face and make for memorable songs.  Beyond that, I love "Leave the Lights On," a slower and more laid back track.  One thing that was new to Jewel's sound on this release was the use of electronica to create numbers tailor-made for any dance hall, something some fans of her past, more folkish tunes didn't take well to.  I for one love it.  Some of my favorite tracks here are the lesser known ones stacked at the end that are great for dancing or exercising to.  I mean, you just can't get more catchy than songs like "Yes U Can," "U & Me = Love," and the rousing track where Jewel demonstrates her love for her home country, "America."  Excellent stuff.		There is actually not one weak track or moment of filler here though and Jewel sustains the listener's interest for the 53 minute duration of the CD, as only Jewel can, all the while proudly wearing her femininity and sex appeal on her sleeve.  The only reason I'm rating this album just shy of five stars is I liked the 2006 follow-up "Goodbye Alice in Wonderland" even slightly better.  Still, if you want to feel young and smart and sexy no matter what age you are, Jewel will show you how on "0304."  Highly recommended.
0,They are the coolest, hippest, Gospel Duo ever!!! I love Mary Mary they are dope. I would love to see them live when they come to NJ or New York.

0,Bob Welch was a former Fleetwood Mac member - he resigned and was replaced by Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham...we all know what happened then.  This song was included on Welch's 1977 French Kiss album and has Juice Newton singing backup.  It hit #14 in 1977, with the album going platinum.

0,"Made in California" is , a gorgeous, six CD set, 473 minutes of audio and a massiave 174 tracks.  The box set also features 60 previously unreleased tracks (including 17 live tracks)  The box self is a follow up to the 1993 career spanning boxset set of "Good Vibrations".  The box set also contains a 1959 essay by Brian Wilson entitled "My Philosophy".  Like "Good Vibrations", "Made in California" follows the band's career chronologically with the exception of the very last "From the Vaults" disk.		A major draw of any such archival project as this are the unreleased tracks.  Of the 60 rare tracks, there are several, legitimately rare, unreleased recordings, with the key tracks being "Goin' To The Beach," "California Feelin'," "Soul Searchin'," "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling," and "You're Still A Mystery".  However, the majority of the tracks comprise of instrumental tracks, alternate mixes, vocal sessions, radio spots, and a lot of live recordings.		None of the unreleased material is quite as important or on the same par as the unreleased material from "Good Vibrations" (which was largely due to the thirty minutes of  "SMiLE" from Disk 2), but collectors will find some worthwhile stuff here. While the SMiLE recordings were always essential to the narrative of The Beach Boys, none of the unreleased songs here really change or add anything to their musical canon on the same scale. Also, given the cornucopia of music and sheer wealth of material we got on "The Smile Sessions", perhaps we had been a little spoiled.		But these concerns are largely nitpicking.  More Beach Boys music is great, and while maybe not as stunning as the unreleased material from "Good Vibrations" or nearly as essential, the unreleased music of "Made in California" is pretty great stuff (even if some of the live stuff is iffy at times).		Of the 114 remaining tracks, you have a lot of the essential Beach Boy tracks, although for such an expansive collection, there are some key tracks missing, including "She Knows Me Too Well," "Getting Hungry," "Funky Pretty," and "You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone".  Just be aware that even though this is key set there are still some rather inextricable omissions (which there always seems to be for whatever band)		Also, "Made in America" shows just how many times The Beach Boys' discography has been remastered over the years, with various tracks being remastered at various times, which can create an aural inconsistency over such a large set as this.  There are mixes from 2003, 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2013.		For example, "Salt Lake City" is a 2001 Stereo mix, "Let Him Run Wild" is a 2007 stero mix and "Graduation Day " is a 2007 stereo mix (Disk 2, tracks 5-8).  "Barbara Ann" is a 2012 stereo mix.  Five songs from "Pet Sounds" include four 1996 stereo mixes (an album which was famously mixed in mon) as well as one 2001 stereo mix.  Although the set is arranged chronologically, we are getting mixes that range from the original releases to mixes (of which there are several) done as late as 2012!  Oddly enough, there is also a stereo mix of "Heroes and Villians" and "Wonderful" from the 1967 "Smiley Smile" album that are 2012.  Given the massive "The Smile Sessions" of 2011, not sure why they were still mixing in 2012.		In terms of The Beach Boys' career, since 2011, Beach Boy fans have been in something of a Paradise, a full on celebration of the Wilson brothers, cousins, and everyone's favorite surfer dudes.  2011 saw the release of the infamous "The SMiLE Sessions" with "finished version" of the album (well, as finished as SMiLE can be, given how incomplete several of the recordings are).  In 2012, the band marked their 50th anniversary with a new (and fantastic) album (!!!) called "That's Why God Made the Radio", along with a great live summer tour.		"That's Why God Made the Radio" marks the first time Brian Wilson recorded with the 1988 "Still Cruisin'" project that produced "Kokomo".  However, "Still Cruisin'" featured several re-recordings of their 1960s material along with a few new tracks.  It was also the first original studio album by the band since the critically panned "Summer In Paradise" from 1992 (twenty years previously), where they sounded little more than a parody of themselves and even had John Stamos in his Full House Uncle Jesse personae singing lead on the 1969 classic "Forever".  They also did a country covers album where they are little more than a backing band to various current country acts on the 1996 "Stars and Stripes Forever Vol 1".  While better than "Summer in Paradise", the last side about "Stars and Stripes" the better.  Thankfully they had the good sense not to issue a Vol 2.		All that being said, for Beach Boy fans, they had precious little in terms of new material from the band for over two decades.  Thankfully, though, the 50th anniversary really united the band and gave them a common drive, which is good, given how dysfunctional they have been throughout the entirety of their career (keeping up with who was suing who in the Beach Boys camp was like trying to predict the on any given day who Van Halen's lead singer was going to be).  Closing out the celebrations is "Made in California"		For those wanting to really get into The Beach Boys, you may be better served by going with "Pet Sounds" first or "SMiLE", as this set represents a significant investment.  The unreleased stuff will largely appeal only to collectors (with a few key exceptions).  However, for those wanting to pick up a bunch of Beach Boys in a very nice set that is career-spanning, this is a better choice than "Good Vibrations", especially since the main draw of "Good Vibrations" (the "SMiLE" recordings) has been completely negated with "The SMiLE Sessions.		Overall, even given the somewhat inconsequential nature of some of the outtakes and omissions of some key tracks, "Made in California" is a great way to end the 50th Anniversary celebration of the Wilson family's legacy.

0,This is a song that just makes you feel good. For all the women out there who have been mistreated, cheated on etc. this is a major girl power anthem. Love this song can't get enough!
0,The words are scripture based and she tells the story very well. Ms Hudson brings the song to life and does it well
0,Five MARVELOUS Stars!! A STELLAR Grammy-nominated musical look at desire and temptation. For a decade and an half,  jazz diva Tierney Sutton's highly creative band has been one of jazz' longer-running small ensembles. Some of her CDs are thematic, such as the Bill Evans tribute<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blue-in-Green/dp/B00005N581/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blue in Green</a>and the sideways glance of<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/On-the-Other-Side/dp/B000LV6RBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">On the Other Side</a>of love ("Get Happy" as a dirge was both daring and effective). This highly enjoyable CD can also be looked at from the 'spiritual thematic point of view' decrying the seductive dangers of fame and fortune or even as homage' from one of today's certified young jazz divas to past singing stars like Peggy Lee (Fever), Carmen McRae (Skylark) and Julie London (Cry Me a River). Lady Day, Abbey, June, Betty, and Ella also come to mind. As usual, Ms Sutton is a cohesive member of her talented, somewhat instrumentally unusual quintet, as in the title of another CD called<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/I-m-with-the-Band/dp/B000A8AXHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">I'm with the Band</a>. Versatile pianist Christian Jacob, drummer Ray Brinker (who is on fire) and 2 inventive bassists: Kevin Axt  & Trey Henry who work well together on the bottom, round out the five spots. These 5 take some familiar standards into new fiery frameworks and multi-rhythmic setups, often shifting gears in flight out of serene starts to dizzying heights and back again (e.g. the smoldering "Love Me or Leave Me").		The 'best of the best' begins with a beautiful 7 minute exposition of "It's Only A Paper Moon" which starts with a spiritual poem over an urgent Ray Brinker beat. That effectively contrasts with Tierney's out of tempo rhapsodic vocalizing which then leads to a burning in-tempo Christian Jacob solo with Brinker pouring on the heat with his brushes. A sensational "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" again has the urgent beat and voice, as the song takes on a celestial meaning for the word "Daddy" as Brinker's accents and rimshots burn behind Tierney's and Jacob's sizzling highly-stylized solos. The two bassists also effectively use differing pizzicato roles on the bottom and in the arrangements. "Long Daddy Green" switches the "Daddy" word and performance to something more seductive. "Fever" escapes Julie London's spell as Tierney puts her stamp on it, bending, twisting, and chopping the notes. "It's All Right With Me" is a smoky experience. Even the insistent multi-tracked "Whatever Lola Wants" bends to Tierney's musical will, as does "Skylark". Tierney Sutton & Band prove it's all about the emphasis & crank up another BIG Winner. DON'T trust the song samples, they don't give a hint of the exhilarating flights that await beyond the intros. Stunning performances!! My Highest Recommendation. Five ENJOYABLE Stars.

0,I always liked this song when it was used in several shows I had watched on tv.  I is nice to be able to hear the whole song, music and all.  It has a thought provoking message in it.  not a song I would say would be for young kids but one that can be enjoyed by many ages.
0,Great collection. Great price. Don't miss out on this one if you like classical music and a great variety of the classics.
0,This is the remixed version of the song. Absolutely love it
0,I love the beat to this song more than anything else, but Weezy & Drizzy did the dang thang. BUT I could have done without the weird ending.. it was just stupid.

0,Imagine dragons got amazing songs. I loved radio active and this one is great too.
0,This groove wore out the turntable when I first got it.  Not only was the single version one of the best songs of the late 80's, the New Jack Swing remixes took the song to a higher level.

0,Relaxing this is not! It is high energy, driving music. Kalki, Unstoppable, and Arise are probably the most familiar of the songs as they have been used on TV and movies. If I need to get something done and I need a little push, this is the CD I come to.		If you like the Electronica genre, you should try this CD.

0,This is actually the first Trivium album I got, a little over two years ago. Since then, I've listened to this album countless times. In fact, the first time I listened to it was all the way through, it was so good and able to keep my interest throughout. Although Trivium's first two albums are more associated with the metalcore sound, "The Crusade" takes them into a pure thrash-metal direction. Blistering guitar solos, bludgeoning riffs, breakneck drumming, meter-pushing tempos, skilled songwriting and aggressive vocals dominate the album throughout; however, I would also like to point out that there are indeed some very beautiful melodic sections and larger-than-life sounding elements incorporated, making this more than just another thrash album.		I could end right there and just tell you to go out and get the album already, but that would be an injustice on my part. "The Crusade" is one of the best metal albums of this decade in my opinion, and let me explain in the rest of my review.		We kick off with "Ignition", a fast and angry song about the corruption of the government and its pointless obsession with the horrors of war and violence. Going from a speed-metal verse to a softer, more mournful sounding chorus, this song has a nice contrast to it. The ending guitar drone then brings us into "Detonation", which, by the the title alone, is a sequel to the first song. This song has one of the most intense sections on the entire album, with some insane guitar soloing over some of the most brutal double-bass drumming, almost taking the band to a death metal sort of sound, but not quite. A sad and yet gorgeous second half of the song rings out with slower verses and huge-sounding guitar sweeps, making yet another nice contrast in sounds.		"Entrance of the Conflagration" is a moshpit-ready headbanger with some catchy-as-ever riffs, a complex mid-section and more great solos; this is one of my favorite songs on the album. "Anthem (We Are The Fire)" is right up there, too, with uplifting lyrics, amazing guitar solos and a shout-a-long chant after the solo section. This is truly an anthem! Even though it has just as much energy as the previous song, "Unrepentant" brings us back to the darker side, with lyrics about a true-life crime, just as in "Entrace of the Conflagration", the same which can be said for the next song, "And Sadness Will Sear".		Taking things to a more fantasy-based nature, "Becoming The Dragon" combines more huge-sounding melodies with pure thrash-metal energy and a generally good vibe. Galloping riffs and some frantic solos are featured, along with, surprisingly, a bass solo! Paolo lets his bass ring out some interesting notes and phrases as the song fades out on a slow and interesting note. "To The Rats" is another truly awesome, three-and-a-half minute burst of energy, this one also almost treading into death-metal territory with its breakneck speed. However, a cool change is thrown in with the shout-a-long chorus, slowed down for good measures. "This World Can't Tear Us Apart" is a beautiful slow-dance styled song with some great melodies and sometimes-straightforward, sometimes-enigmatic lyrics. This song offers a nice change of pace, and is done in just three-and-a-half minutes.		"Tread The Floods" has a sick intro with a great buildup until the chorus, which is one of the most empowering and catchiest choruses on the entire album, and the way it's sung at the end of the song ends it perfectly. "Contempt Breeds Contamination" is the fourth song based on a true-life crime, and this is another song that utilizes the low B-string, making it a heavy number indeed. The soloing also adds to the power, this time being spread out instead of one solo after another such as in "Anthem (We Are The Fire").		"The Rising" seems to be a rather underrated song, although it's honestly just as good as any other song on the album. A slower, more majestic pace is featured here in addition to another great shout-a-long chorus. Finally, the album ends with the eight-and-a-half minute instrumental epic title track, "The Crusade". An awesome way to end the album and a great song just in general, you can tell the band put a lot of effort into writing this instrumental masterpiece.		Comparatively, "The Crusade" is indeed, different from "Ascendancy", going in a thrash-metal direction and having more three-and-a-half minute songs for the most part, instead of the generally longer songs on "Ascendancy". Even though the two albums are different, "The Crusade" comes highly recommended to Trivium fans, as it shows the band at the top of their game and maturing as musicians and songwriters. Well, that about wraps up this review. In short, "The Crusade" is an album that keeps metal alive today, regardless of the scene. Get this and Trivium's newest album "Shogun" if you don't have that already, and I guarantee you'll be happy. Thanks for the time, and peace.
0,Best album ever!

0,I wasn't bowled over by the "Glee" tribute to this character and series regular, now deceased, but I felt Rachel (Lea Michele) did a great job on an Adele-covered song.  I pulled up Adele's version, but this particular approach to the song I find much  more listenable.
0,A great buy!

0,This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs ever.  Ms. Flack, who at the time was a professor of music professor at Howard University in DC, delivers one of the best performances of her career with a story that anyone who has attended a musical performance and felt something for the performer could readily identify with.  The words, the music, and the singing come together perfectly.  Bravo!

0,Another song not in my usual genre that a friend recommended after she heard my complaints that an old friend borrowed money and ran. The video was how I heard this first, and the video is amazing too, but I loved the song so much I had to buy it - don't judge, but this is literally the first and only Rihanna song I've heard, but listening to the song (and love that the lyrics are on there - something I look for before downloading songs now) - I can picture the video while I listen - and it's just awesome. Love it.
0,Gordon has a voice that makes you want to listen to it all, because you know that it will be interesting to the last. He has a story tellers ability to keep your interest in the entire message. Easy to listen to.

0,"Dream with Me" was the call of Jackie Evancho as she reached out for her dream. Her dream certainly is ,or has. come true.	Jackie's voice is so original, so beautiful, and she enter into her world of music with each song, on stage, recording studio, or where ever.	You can feel her songs as she live each one for the few minutes she needs to sing it.	"The Rains of Castamere"  is such a beautiful tune, and made for her voice.  It is rich, full, and at times haunting.	We are full of awe and expectation of wonder waiting for her new album , 'Awakening' coming out in September.
0,It was easy to purchase. It sounds great. There were multiple selections available. In the future I plan to purchase similar products and will tell others about my experience.

0,Bought this to have on my phone.  When I travel, I don't sleep as well in hotel rooms.  This helps me to fall asleep.  I love to find little gems like this to add to my Sleep/Relax playlist.
0,I listen to a wide range of music, and often I don't realize that a particular song I enjoy isn't a modern release until I look up more information about it online.  I frequently heard John "Cougar" Mellencamp's "Jack and Diane" on a "lite" radio station in the 2000s, but always thought it was a recent release -- it wasn't until recently that I learned it actually came out in the early '80s.  This doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the song, however -- I enjoy older music more than most modern music, and '80s music especially.  And this particular song is a fun and thoughtful one, upbeat but with lyrics that anyone can appreciate.		A mellower rock song with electric and acoustic guitars as the main instruments (the drums are more subdued up until the bridge), this song showcases the titular teens as the main characters -- two kids growing up in a small town in America's heartland, entertaining dreams of the future and enjoying each other's company.  Even as they make big plans for the future, the chorus and the bridge counsel them to hang onto their youth as long as they can, because everyone grows up eventually, and there's no returning to the days of your youth.  After all "life goes on, long after the thrill of living is done."		Whether or not you agree with that sentiment (there's still the old adages of "age is only a number" and "growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional," after all), this is still a powerful song, sort of a grown-up version of Kenny Loggins' "Return to Pooh Corner."  While the singer of the former longs for a return to the days of childhood, John Mellencamp seems content to reminisce on the teenage years, and accepts that they won't come back and it's best to enjoy them as long as you can.		A very enjoyable rock number, one that transcends its era and is timely even to modern audiences.
0,I love every song on this CD..this artist sounds like many hugely successful artists mixed together and ultimately pulls off a unique cd with innovative lyrics, one especially hot and nasty!  Love the whole thing; every song feels like a hit!

0,Mary J. Blige is absolutely ADORED by many of my friends.  They love and appreciate her because she never tried to be "Hollywood."  She has been that same girl from New York that she was when she made her debut in 1992 and for that, we love her!  She was never surreptitious about her ordeals with drugs, abusive relationships and family drama.  The pain that she has endured is felt all throughout her music, which is something else her supporters appreciate.  She is definitely one of the most sincere and real people in the industry of entertainment; there's no arguing that point.  Her album, "Growing Pains" is a great offering.  It doesn't have any songs that are quite as memorable as, say, "I'm Goin' Down", "Sweet Thing", "Love No Limit", "Be Happy", or "Not Gon Cry" (I could go on for days, she has a slew of sensational songs!!!), but it is a good listen and worth purchasing.		 Mary Jane Blige has this unique way of delivering songs; that is, to me, what makes her music so listenable and memorable.  It is not easy to explain, but once you listen to her best songs, you'll understand.  With this album, her delivery is still as it has always been.  "Talk to Me" is a prime example of my previous explanation.  She does a nice job executing this track.  She extends her voice quite a bit here, and I enjoyed listening.  Even her faster tracks are heartfelt, for example, "Just Fine."  This song was released to radio, and though it took a few listens to lure me in, I was eventually taken in by this track.  The beat and hook are infectious.  It's one of the best moments on "Growing Pains."  In short, this song is about a woman who is truly confident with being herself and is not about to change because she's "fine." (I suppose that could mean "fine" as in mood and/or physical appearance, take it how you want.)  Someone strongly suggested that I listen to "Stay Down" and I am so happy I listened to him!  I listen to that song a lot because, lyrically, it is beautiful.  This song is about staying with your mate through the bad times because good times are sure to come and overpower those harder times.  Those who hear this song are sure to gain something from it.  This album is a bit flawed in a few places.  "Smoke" is the weakest moment on the album.  The production is not good, the lyrics are just alright; collectively, it's just not a good track.  Usher shows up for "Shake Down" and does a good job, but this track doesn't stand out.  Everything about this track sits on the average mark.		 R&B lovers, Mary lovers, and lovers of music, what are you waiting for?  Go get it!  This woman is a true artist and she exhibits that on this album.		Mikeisha's Top 5		1. "Stay Down"	2. "Just Fine"	3. "Work in Progress (Growing Pains)"	4. "Til the Morning"	5. "Come to Me (Peace)"

0,Wow, I've been waiting for this moment for awhile and I must say I'm happy what they done with this. Their first will always be classic and this will have to stand up against the test of time, I didn't love all the songs on the first one so this has a chance. Hi-tek always been one of my favorite since I heard his solo joint and Kweli is very lyrical and knows when to have fun, these two really do well together. If they ever come back together again I will plan on buying, and now for my list of fav; city playground, in this world, got work, lifting off, ballad of the black gold, just begun, long hot summer, get loose (it grew on me), ends. And what should have been their radio singles; get loose and just begun or ballad of the black gold.

0,5 Stars if you're new to Eisley; 4 Stars for the rest of us		Eisley has released 2 EPs in early and late 2003, the excellent "Laughing City" and "Marvelous Things". For whatever reason, it's taken over another year for the release of their debut album. The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there, and Coldplay's Chris Martin is a big fan as well (Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour).		"Room Noises" (12 tracks, 41 min.) is full of dreamy, yet very catchy songs, not unlike, say, Sixpense None the Richer. The best songs are in the first half of the album, including the opener "Memories", "I Wasn't Prepared", "Memories" (the standout track of the album), and "Brightly Wounded" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers. Other great tracks are "Plenty of Paper", a great up-tempo song, and the closer "Trolley Wood".		What keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs (in newly recorded versions), and that's disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning. We want more new songs! Finally, the Amazon listing shows a bonus track (a remixed version of "Lost at Sea") but the CD I bought doesn't have it, hmmmm... Regardless, Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I can't wait to see them live! "Room Noises" is highly recommended!

0,Highlighted by compassionate soul that is showcased with timeless songwriting,	  superlative production, national pride and plenty of captivating artistry to spare, the	  band Mumford And Sons scored an award-winning masterpiece in 2012 that would	  become a blockbuster success.  Filled with rock solid camaraderie, pulsating solos,	  excellence and a compelling tone, Babel is a near-perfect folk-rock album featuring	  songs about hope and self-determination- abeited by the bands folk-rock virtuosity	  performed with crystallized harmony and powerful singing.  Starting with the official	  title track, the embolden track set concludes with other classic songs like Whispers	  In The Dark, I Will Wait, Holland Road, Ghosts That We Knew, Not With Haste and	  three bonus tracks, including a take on the 1969 Simon And Garfunkle classic The	  Boxer (with Paul Simon and Jerry Douglas sitting in) and a couple acoustic original	  folk tracks which give it the acoustic laden touch that it fully deserve.  This is British	  folk-rock showcased by an English inspirational background as it glisten with bright	  drama and enthralling merriment, so thanks to Babel, Mumford And Sons had took	  their music toward bigger heights.  A Number One album in both Great Britain and	  the United States, the album even got lots of critical accolades, thanks in part from	  its phenomenal success, as the band mastered the sonically impeccable virtuosity	  and punch-to-the-gut power with their towering stroke of genius that is showcased	  by the benefiting folks sounds bind with their unrestrained characteristics that also	  made Babel a more subtle accomplished album.  Although I may have to seriously	  recommend the deluxe edition, which makes it the best edition to date, Babel will	  permanently live in infinity as well as for countless ages.

0,I just saw the movie and actually enjoyed it...it got trashed royally, which made me even more curious as to why...and no, it did not deserve the harsh treatment it garnered.  I enjoy all movies revolving around the music business, and this one is no different... it reminded me of the live remake of Josie & the Pussycats.  My only quibble is why the label and exec (played here by the ace Juliette Lewis) always feel the need to break the original band apart with lies and bad contracts?? And saying it was all Jerrica's greedy idea, the fans won't know the difference because they didn't know who is the real person behind the name, they can be replaced, the label owns the name, etc...it's getting to be a bit cliche and makes all labels look bad, and may in fact discourage artists from pursuing careers in the music biz and signing to labels in the first place.  Besides that, Aubrey Peeples (Layla Grant on Nashville) is just great as Jerrica/Jem...and the soundtrack is fun pop...but it shoulda been a CD as well...people want hard copies...for the music and the artwork and photos...yes you can back it up on a CDR but it's not the same.  I think it was digital only because the movie was such a bomb... If it was successful, yes there woulda been a CD...even School Boy prez and artist manager Scooter Braun makes a cameo but it was cut from the final movie...you can see him in the deleted scenes...maybe that snub cut the CD?? Hmmm...but "Young Blood" sounds like Rachel Platten's "Fight Song" meets Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood". Nothing original about the music on this soundtrack at all...but it's fun.  Will it be listened to in 5 years, let alone TWO?? Probably not...and making it digital only will cut the lifespan by 85%...most people will not know of its existence because it's not a CD you can buy or on display at your local Target either.  I hate when labels do this, I really do!!
0,I didn't realize that there were various versions of the song. This one is not the one on You Tube but is close and doesn't have the instrumental for the second half.
0,Absolutely wonderful new work - a cut above her previous material. I really, really love Lost Dog as well as House of Mercy. Both tell heartbreaking stories and the melodies are just lovely. Looking forward to more from this artist now that she is out of school and devoting full time to her music.
0,1999 was an immensely hot tune back in the day. Anyone who likes Prince and his music would cherish this as a song to savor for years and years to come.

0,Slow ride. Take it easy! Easy...that is the operative word. Think about all of those songs that pop up in your head? And your like, "wow...I'd REALLY like to hear that great song."  Well, the cloud player and MP3 have made finding, downloading those great songs onto all my paired devices, and made it a snap. And very inexpensive. Love it. Just like this song. It popped in my head, and in less than five minutes I'm listening to it! Fantastic! SLOW RIDE (and Free Bird by Skynard) are the two greatest "Slide Guitar" songs EVER!!
0,A flock of Seagulls had a hit with this song as the music had a rousing beat and the voices that went so well with the beat of the song that took you along for the ride upon the rhythm of the band as they put their heart into the tune they sang and played. Years have come and gone but the songs of The Flock Of Seagulls lives on beautifully.

0,"Undercurrent" is the fifteenth solo piano release from Michele McLaughlin in as many years, and I am always re-amazed with each new album at how far she has come as a pianist and composer over the years. Her first few albums were recorded on a digital piano and although she still records at home, she now composes and records on a Fazioli F212 concert grand. What a difference and what an amazing piano! Mastered and engineered by Joe Bongiorno (Piano Haven Studio), the piano sound is rich, warm, and very expressive. The album was inspired by Platos quote: Always be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle, and the music is reflective of several of McLaughlins own battles as well as many wonderful moments from the past two years. The thirteen tracks vary in style and mood from serene and peaceful to joyful, turbulent, and pensive. Fellow pianists will be excited to learn that there is a companion songbook for this album available in hard copy or download, as individual pieces and as books with all thirteen songs.		"Undercurrent" begins with 11,000 Miles, a buoyant and carefree piece inspired by the two-month, 11,000 mile concert tour McLaughlin did with Scott D. Davis in 2013. Light-hearted and quickly-flowing, it clearly expresses the joy of sharing music and the adventure of traveling to new places. Although much more subdued, Living In Awe conveys a different kind of joy. The first piece McLaughlin composed after moving to her mountainside home, it conveys her contentment and happiness in her new environment.  The Space Between is one of my favorites. Quite a bit darker than the first few tracks, it reflects on the distance between Michele and her sister since moving about ten miles away after being neighbors for many years. Strong feelings of loss and sadness run through the piece, made dramatic with an active left hand at the lower end of the piano and a very poignant melody. I also really like the title track, which is also on the dark and powerful side, thinking about the battles everyone must face and deal with no matter how bright and sunny their lives appear to be. Starstuff returns to a much lighter mood, and was inspired by Carl Sagans quote We are all made from starstuff. Passages are played in the upper registers of the piano and sound to me like the twinkle of stars in a dark sky. Never Give Up is encouragement without words and a reminder that no matter how difficult times may seem, there is always beauty in life and light at the end of the tunnel. Melody In Motion is a lively minor key waltz that expresses how McLaughlin feels when she composes and the excitement when a new piece begins to emerge from her fingertips. Stepping Stones is a heartfelt, pensive piece about the paths we take in life based on the decisions we make. Synesthesia brings the album to a close with a piece composed on a rainy day on the road. Although lively and energetic, there is a moody cast to the piece that gives it a very soulful quality that I really like.		"Undercurrent" adds several new chapters to the autobiography that is Michele McLaughlins musical output. Deeply personal yet universal and very accessible, it brings together so much of lifes shared experience, reminding us how interconnected we all are. Recommended!

0,I only purchase off of Amazon songs I WANT & LOVE=Why would I ever give less than 5 stars to any mp3 I had purchased unless the mp3 was bad quality which NEVER HAPPENS?
0,This song sounds great on my computer, Kindle, and Roku! This is definitely a great find! I am so glad that I purchased it!
0,Martika is one of the best pop singers of the 80's era. Her soothing voice, talent and music among the best.
0,This MP3 is not the 'Best Of Breathe' 2004 EMI Philippines CD version that has much more width and depth. It sounds ok but it is the softest song in my collection. I have to turn the volume way up to hear this one. Maybe messing around with Audacity could fix the low volume but it will still not sound as good as the import version.
0,Just right..arrived on time....good for the money...thank you
0,'Margaritaville' is Buffet at his best.  He could have retired after this song, just like Robin Thicke could retire now after 'Blurred Lines'.  Apparently Buffet's success with this led him to specialize in songs about booze, but 'Margaritaville' would be pretty hard to match.
0,Let me start out by saying I wasn't really feeling this song when it first came out. It was OK to me, nothing more nothing less. I did like her voice but really, I thought it was just gonna come and go.		In two ways, I was wrong:		Radio played it quite a bit and once my mother got a hold of this song, she really, really, REALLY did NOT let go. She played it a lot and it grated on my nerves so bad, I started to "hate" this girl.		But fast forward some time and I say this is a good song made great because of the vocal force and runs that were perfected to a tee. Some say the lyrics are a bit juvenile and they kinda are overall, but the voice really does carry it over in this case.		The music to the song is good too but it doesn't compare to Lions, Tigers & Bears which also has better lyrics. If you have yet to hear it and have been ignoring radio, that's a good thing. But it's a bad thing if you haven't heard said song.		Find it somewhere and dig in.		4.25 stars = B

0,Michael Dulin wears his heart on his musical sleeve on his most romantic and possibly most personal album to date, "My Beloved."One of the most incredible pianists on the planet, Dulin's original music is graceful and elegant with his classical roots in clear evidence. Dulin began his musical career in the classical realm, competing at an international level. He started composing music in about 2003 and has become one of the most beloved and admired pianist/composers in the contemporary instrumental music field. Dulins music usually falls into the new age category because it doesnt easily fit into any one genre. More classical than anything else, there are also strong jazz influences, but it is Dulins amazing technique coupled with his heart-tugging sensitivity and sophisticated touch that put him into a genre all his own. Something of a pianists pianist, who hasn't drooled over those magical fingers flying effortlessly over the piano keys, expressing anything and everything he chooses? On some of his previous releases, Dulin has used keyboards in addition to his Steinway, but this album is pure solo piano heaven!		"My Beloved"  begins with Beloved, a sweet love song that begins with a simple but very tender melody that evolves into a breathtaking showcase for Dulins expressive (and very impressive!) playing. Devotion was composed as a way for Dulin to tell his wife that he loves her more than anything. Lyrical and graceful, it is not as complex as some of the pieces, but comes straight from the heart. Chanson is a slow, romantic waltz that accompanies a promise to dance together in Paris someday. Through The Night is a favorite. The gentle flow of the piece is deeply introspective and feels very free and in the moment. Walking Joy is light and carefree, played at an easy pace that is relaxed and happy. My Treasure is another favorite. More than a bit Chopin-esque, the simple melody flows effortlessly over the passionate underpinnings of the piece - gorgeous! As Long As Were Together conveys a strong sense of contentment and optimism without being sugar-coated. The regular pulse of the left hand contrasts with the free-flowing right, making this a fascinating piece on several levels. When I Think Of You is a magical love song that reminds me a bit of Liszt - so beautiful! Rhapsody ends the album on a playful note that always makes me smile - I cant wait to play this one!		With "My Beloved," Michael Dulin proves once again that hes The Man when it comes to the piano! Let this wonderful music transport your heart to a world of love and devotion where all things are possible. Sure to be a Favorite for 2015, I give "My Beloved" my highest recommendation.
0,80's music at its finest. These girls rock!

0,This song is classic Joni Mitchell, whom some people claim is classic 1960's folk music. I highly recommend it for it's sweet melody.

0,You may not know his name, but for listeners of a certain age, it won't take long to recognize his contribution to popular music. Luther Ingram was an R&B singer/songwriter from Jackson, TN. Ingram was best known for the early '70s hit "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right".		Ingram made his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed with KoKo Records in the late 1960's. His first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts, even though Koko was only a small label, owned by his manager and record producer, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.		"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right" is a song written by Stax Records songwriters Homer Banks, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson and first released by Bobby "Blue" Bland. The song is about an adulterous love affair, told from the point of view of either the mistress or the cheating spouse, depending on the gender of the performer. Luther Ingram recorded his version of the tune in 1972. It would become a Top Ten smash peaking at #3 in August of that year. This is the original hit recording.
0,This was another song I chose for my dads service,the quality if these songs were great.the price was hardly nothing. This really made a difference to have what I wanted fast.

0,I admit that I first heard Black Betty by Ram Jam accidently over 6 years ago when it came on one of my alarm clock radios when my husband and I were still living in Florida. I say over six years because I had first heard this song either when my husband and I were living in Mayport Naval Base Florida or Orlando Florida. I have also heard a version by Tom Jones before on one of his greatest hits collection. Around 2015,I then heard it on iheartradio and this version of Black Betty by Ram Jam grew on me after hearing it enough times on my personalized favorites radio station especially because of the guitars and the well timed lyrics with the music. This song could best be described as hard rock/classic rock.

0,Prime Cuts:  Belongs to You, All the Time in the World, Just Look at You		Wayne has left his mark as a storyteller-singer: who could forget Wayne's passionate meliorism coming alive in the tale of an abused child finding hope through the altruistic love of a stranger in his hit "Paper Angels"?  Or how can one's heart not be dashed when listening to Wayne's "Blue and Brown" which tells of a policeman having to imprison his own brother?  Such heart slashing stuff dissipated with Wayne's sophomore album "Do You Believe Me Now?" "Do You Believe Me Now?" sadly fell into the cracks of bombastic commercialism where most of the track lacked threadbares of intricate heart woven tapestry.  Now album number three "Sara Smile" is a vast improvement--though still not on par with his meritorious debut--it has more heartfelt moments balanced with a few run of the mill radio treats.  Perhaps such improvements is due to the tight control of songs--instead of giving us a truckload of fillers, Waye has narrowed down to the traditional sacrosanct number of 10.  However, what is avant-garde (at least in country music) is that Wayne has enlisted not one but three producers:  all of whom are dignitaries--Nathan Chapman (Taylor Swift and Sara Evans), Mark Bright (Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire) and Dann Huff (Martina McBride and Keith Urban).		Consistent to Wayne's canon of songs, the ballads are hands down the winners here.  Though the theme of heartbreak has been part of country music's repertoire since its genesis, when Wayne sings Steve Robison and Hillary Lindsey's "All the Time in the World" he brings right us into the story as the protagonist re-visits the rendezvous he used to meet with his old flame.  "Belongs to You," is a all out power ballad in the tradition of Rascal Flatts that showcases Wayne's endearing and high soaring tenor.  Unlike his debut, there is only one message song (those that belong to the "Soup for the Soul" collection), this time it's the sober "Elephant Ears."  "Elephant Ears" is a narrative song that details the touching story of an adopted child struggling to say "I love you."  This is inspirational stuff at its most affecting best.  "Just Look at You" ought to swoon the romantic right off their feet:  earnest, elegant and all so beautiful; this is destined to be a future Valentine's Day staple.		The title cut "Sara Smile," for those who did not grow up in the 70s, is a cover of a Hall and Oates' smash.  Reverentially keeping close to the original, Wayne's version adds little to the duo's version, though fiddles and steel are added in to curry radio's favour.  Nevertheless, its catchy melody and well constructed melody are worth introducing to today's younger generation.  It doesn't take a prophet to foresee that "Things I Believe In" will be a mammoth hit. Written by Keith Urban and John Shanks, "Things I Believe" bears all the finger marks of Keith Urban.  From its feisty banjo flicks, to its breezy rock groove, to Wayne's Urban-like falsetto, it is almost as if this is Wayne being a guest vocalist on Urban's track.  "That's A Memory," on the other hand, is one of those obligatory rocks with an anthem rock climax and rousing guitars.		Wayne has certainly climbed out of his sophomore slum as "Sara Smile" is a much better album in terms of a stronger material and more investment by Wayne in the lyrical depth and emotional levels.  However, it still doesn't hold a candle to his stellar debut.  Alas, ballad fans who are looking for sonic decadence to indulge in will find plenty to put smiles on your faces.
0,Roots rock song from the 1950s - great lyrics - true as still today, as then.

0,Germanys power metal army is anchored  in my opinion  by the veteran triad of Helloween, Blind Guardian and Accept. Despite age, line-up changes and a morphing metal world these bands have carried the torch for decades. But every great army needs a savvy and aggressive cavalry filled with younger soldiers who are the eyes and ears of the greater force. Enter Primal Fear. No, they haven't been around as long as those progenitors of the scene, but Scheepers and company have proven that they possess the conviction and skill to not only spar with the best of them, but to carry the battle onward once the veteran forces retire. For the past few years they have been delivering the metal with an increased fervor  their last two albums (Unbreakable and Delivering The Black) right up there with some of the best power metal the world has to offer. And despite the departure of drummer Randy Black, they have not lost any momentum in the rolling out of Rulebreaker, an album which shares much in common with its stellar predecessor. The dynamic duo of Sinner and Hansen has perfected the art of producing/recording classic metal as these songs have plenty of punch, crunch and shred.		For me, Scheepers remains one of the top 5 metal singers out there right now  his vocal style absolutely perfect for this metal. Beyrodt, Naumann and Karlsson drive the leads while Sinner anchors this wall of guitars with his staunch bass. Francesco Jovino rounds out the 6 man ensemble  his drumming perfectly complimenting the bands Priest meets Accept style rhythm approach. Songwise, its all good, and its all metal but the highlights for me this time around would definitely be In Metal We Trust (the perfect metal anthem!), Rulebreaker and the absolutely killer epic track We Walk Without Fear, which reminds me a lot of One Night In December but even better, even more passionate and brutal. Consistently great, the Fear have once again delivered the metal with pace, power and pride.
0,This is a hot cd from start to the end. Foxy has come with the rawness. This is a breath of fresh air to rap especially with weak female albums; Lil KIm's "Notorius Kim", Da Brat's "Unrestricted", Trina's "The Baddest", Angie Martinez's album and especially Amil's and Queen Pen's garbage albums.  This album establishes the fact that the more a REAL MCee raps, the better the lyric becomes and when you add emotion and confidence you will become unstoppable. This is the best Cd that has ever come from her. The first single "Bk Anthem" jumped it off but in actuality it jumped off with that "Bang, Bang" flow. In which Lil kim was put in her place. Then she drops "Oh Yeah" with Spragga Benz which is a hype track. It just keeps flowing on and on with this album from "730" to "Hood Scriptures" (which has the most creative sound I have heard in a while) to Table will turn and so on. So all you [...] Lil kim fans you heard the answers to kim's weak flow on  notorious kim. Now realize this cd is so close to a classic that it is sick. This is one of the best of the year so far. Much success to Foxy and def Jam. She joins the list with Remi,Rah and Eve as being the best female Mcees out now, with much respect to Jean Grey and Apani B. This Cd is tight. One.
0,What more can be said about Ms. Stone, she always puts out great music and I will continue to support her. I remember her from the group Sequence as Angie B when I was in Jr. High and in the group Vertical Hold. I have those cd's too. True music lovers will enjoy this cd, it will not disappoint.

0,Ronald Isley is still as smooth as he ever was on this album. Inundated with ballads, the women are sure to find tracks that will have replay value and the gentlemen can learn a thing or two from these lyrics for Isley speaks on giving women what they want from a material and emotional standpoint. T.I. and Aretha Franklin are featured here; they do quite well. Isley sounds very gentle as he croons through all ten tracks.		"Supposed to Do" is sure to be a favorite, especially to the ladies. Isley says that a women is supposed to have breakfast cooked for them in the morning and good sex at the crack of dawn, as well cars and homes, all courtesy of their man. It's a great and sexy ballad indeed. "Put Your Money" is one of the more contemporary tracks on "Mr. I." I enjoyed it. T.I. does a nice job with his bars. "What I Miss the Most" is the performance of the album. He is doing some serious crooning and the beautiful lyrics and fantastic instrumentation only enhance the song.		There are no missteps and no filler here. Just press play and hold your lover!		Mikeisha's Top 5		1. "What I Miss the Most"	2. "Supposed to Do"	3. "No More"	4. "Put Your Money on Me"	5. "If I Lose My Woman"

0,Like so many, I had a feverish reaction to Chan "Cat Power" Marshall's breakthrough opus, 1998's Moon Pix. In those days Marshall could only sort of play guitar and kind of sing, yet she undeniably knew how to make a unique album. In the years since, Marshall has become a competent - and even creative - guitarist, a very good songwriter and, most considerably, one of the hardest working and distinct vocalists of her time. That voice, it soars.		Marshall's last album-full of originals, 2006's The Greatest, pushed the artist to another level. No longer was she the shy indie rock pixie with boyish good looks and artsy singer/songwriter fare; she was now a tall, model-esque soul singer with a big, full-sounding soul album that thousands of people were suddenly buying with their coffee and paper towels at the Target cash wrap. Sun, Cat Power's seventh album of originals (and ninth overall), takes a step back from the big box checkout line, offering up Marshall's most artsy batch of tunage since the beloved Moon Pix.		Despite not having the clearest, most approachable sound, I think Sun is most definitely an accessible, confident even poppy record. Its language isn't nearly as universal as the soul sound of The Greatest, and the song structures and arrangements aren't as avant-garde as Moon Pix or the the two records that came before it. We hear drum machines contrasted against gritty licks, the focus always on Marshall's voice, which is more subtle, layered and nuanced than on recent records. Where The Greatest was bombastic in its straight-forward style, Sun is a minimalist exercise in labored detail, the Cat having clearly spent much time hunched over the keyboards and samplers that ornament her basic tracks. The result is a stylistically challenging listen that, while more instantly accessible than it sounds, rewards familiarity with the kind of tasteful, timeless, hip detail Marshall has long been known for.		"3,6,9," one of the three (Or is it six? Or is it nine?) tracks that first helped me to understand this anew Cat, feels, at first, like a modern-era pop mess.  Marshall includes so many production details - including bits of auto-tune - into what is otherwise a straightforward pop song that reminds me, in sprit at least, of Marah's Float Away with the Friday Night Gods, a very hated, highly misunderstood attempt at big pop appeal. A few listens later and my aesthetic impression moved from Float Away to U2's Pop, a similarly modern and gutsy stab at high-production pop rock. Fun, strange, challenging rides, both.		Why release an artsy, challenging, possibly off-putting pop record after achieving breakthrough status with a loyal genre record like The Greatest? Because, as noted above, Marshall is nothing if not an album-maker. A Bowie-inspired creative spirit who prefers the thrill of creative challenge to the comfort of strategic art. We hear that spirit, that freedom, on every track. The biggest achievement here is how Marshall has managed to form her sprawling ideas about modern pop - and classical songwriter style - in a cohesive piece.		It's anybody's guess what the legacy of Sun will be. My assumption is that, despite being maybe her most catchy batch of tunes, the record will endure as a deep catalog treasure amongst Cat Power enthusiasts. A side note favorite, loved for its strong personality and creative bravery. To me, Sun is not just one of the year's most interesting and accomplished listens, but also the second best Cat Power disc yet, stuck only behind 2003's tremendous You Are Free.

0,GREAT SONG TO HAVE, AND WE ALSO PLAY THIS SONG IN OUR BAND AS WELL!. GREAT SONG. MUST BUY THIS!.
0,love it
0,love this version too awsome
0,As good as Ed Sheeran is when you hear this version by Jackie it takes his great song to another level. She adapts her voice to sing in a more Pop way in this. Completely different than most of her other songs. Her vocal skills are amazing. No other singer I've heard can transition between genres as well as she does.
0,good song
0,Nice sounding voice. Sounds a bit like Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, the late Hawaiian singer.		Starts out soft and smooth but breaks with tradition by contrasting bitter and angry verse with soft melancholy melody. The music is not your Dad's easy-listening. Like so many songs nowadays that are made using electronic sounds not produced by traditional real instruments, it's hard to explain what this is. You just have to listen to it. Once you do, you'll keep coming back for another repeat.		You don't really get the picture of how good this song is by listening to the sample.		This is another example of an [Explicit] song on Amazon not being marked as such. The F-word is used in the second verse.
0,This is a great cd and I would highly recommend it to anyone who just loves all music genres.
0,I was browsing for Gloria when I came upon "Self Control". I ended up buying the song. Laura Branigan does a fine job with this song. It doesn't have quite the bounce of Gloria but it's still suitably bright and breezy. So if you want some 80s nostalgia with a good beat and great singing let yourself control go and buy this too.
0,Sam Smith does it again, beautiful, brilliant and sexy. I love the beats and the sound of his voice especially in this song. This song inspired me to write a whole scene in my novel. Thank you Sam Smith for igniting the creativity in me when I felt like I was running on empty.
0,I downloaded this for free, and for the price, this is an enjoyable addition to my collection of Christmas music that I load onto my iPod each Christmas season and delete right after Christmas. If it is still free, definately try it. If you have to pay for it, make sure it meets your tastes in music first.

0,I liked the song and that's all I can say about it as, I didn't buy the whole CD just the one song.
0,Great quality
0,I hate to admit it but I really like their music.
0,I actually purchased this song (and I usually listen to 'free' music from streaming services); sometimes you gotta have a song ready in your playlist when you want it, though.
0,Awesome!!!
0,I love that song.
0,good
0,Heard a bastardization of this song on a detergent commercial, so I decided to purchase it. I almost forgot about The Outfield until Shazam identified the song.
0,Excellent song to wake up to! Thanks Joe. I was a huge fan back in the day. He put on a great concert, too.
0,Good song by Eric Church.  Really catchy tune.

0,Like that I can just download from amazon right to my phone. Always great quality. Lots of great songs to choose from.
0,I like it!
0,good song love the duet with Sean paul
0,Jason Gray reminds us that even in our darkest days when we forget who we are, when we lose touch with the attachment and understanding that God loves us all unconditionally, we need a refresher, a retreat, an inspiration.  Such is this song in the praise and worship genre.
0,A VIEW TO A KILL may be the very Bond song ever. It has power. It has energy. It has a great melody. It has great lyrics. The sound is unforgettable. It is actually a very haunting piece in many ways. It is pure 80s as much as it is pure Bond. I love it. It still moves me to this day.
0,This is my favorite song from Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. I just want to sing it to some people right in their face, especially when the part BEAT IT comes up. I love it because of the lyrics, and it makes me think of all those people I just wanted to say F U too back in the day. This is a song for everybody, a true classic that has stood the test of time and will continue to.		THX,	Kris L. CocKayne
0,I first heard Parquet Courts early last year and immediately bought a copy	of all their releases, I can't decide whether Content Nausea or Sunbathing	Animal is my fave. They remind me of a more humorous Velvet Underground	perhaps, sometimes in a punk mode, sometimes not, always interesting. This	album continues their streak of great releases although there are a few songs	that sound a bit tossed off (not always a bad thing). The good songs more than	make up for those; The Beck-ish hip hop of Captive Of The Sun, the fast and	poignant Two Dead Cops and the epic One Man No City are at this point my	faves. I still like the aforementioned albums a bit better than this, but this is	a recommended album and my feelings may change with more listening.	Along with The Black Angels, Kelley Stoltz, Elbow and Courtney Barnett these	guys are worth a listen if you are not already a fan.
0,Great love song!  Really good music
0,Great Product
0,Love Kenny Loggins' songs.  This one hits a special place for me
0,I've been with Gary for decades, and, although I have all his stuff he hasn't been on my hit parade for years.  Frankly, too often he either bored me or depressed me.  That said "Splinter" is outstandingly different from the rest.		If it weren't for his distinct vocal style, I'd swear I'd discovered a group of DJ's doing industrial-styling to popular songs.  The music is very listenable 'goth-electronic-metal.'  Don't misunderstand this record is far too dark to be considered dance music, but some of the beats and noises remind me of treatments I'd expect from Dead Mouse, Junkie XL, and even James Murphy, making this heavily written piece of writing very listenable.		Pick it up and support quality artist like this.
0,Great song with a great beat. Avicii has done it again and there nothing wrong with Avicii
0,I remember reading an interview with American producer Rick Rubin, when he started making the American Recording albums with Johnny Cash, he says that because Cash had recorded so many studio albums, that initially he was just going through the motions, & Rubin had to really push to get the best record out of him. I think this is the thinking around Thompson using Wilco's The Loft Studio , taking himself out of his comfort zone & adding something unpredictable to the process.	Quite polish, slick & sophisticated, being recorded in loft I thought it would be more rough n ready (I suppose he already done that with Dream Attic).	The usually mix of themes, being in good & bad relationships, curious characters & an homage to the guitarists that have influenced Thompson throughout his career (as always there is some great guitar playing on the album).	The songs on the deluxe version of the album are all good & worth paying the little bit extra (I find it amazing how Thompson can keep on banging out so many songs).	So yet another fascinating record (Thompson seems incapable of releasing a bad album) my an artist who still has a lot more to say.
0,What happens when you take an awesome album, and then put it on the best quality sound medium?  You get an amazing record.		If you are a HUGE Weezer fan, this is the only true way to listen, but if you are just a mediocre fan, it is not anywhere near the ridiculous price that sellers are wanting to this record.
0,Love it
0,I love this song.  Not only is it a great tune, but one of the singers looks almost EXACTLY like Janis from the Muppets.  Seriously.  Check out the video on YouTube.
0,This song is like most of the songs that I've downloaded, it's just your standard hip hop style music. If you like hip hop then you will like it.
0,I wasn't sure I liked this at first listen because it didn't have the usual easy to follow melody but the more I listened to it the more I liked it.  It is now one of my favorite Coldplay tunes.
0,Moby is a genius. I hope I run into him someday so I can tell him.
0,Always loved it and the place it took me to.
0,Thulin has a very unique voice and a different way of telling his message

0,Beautiful song of love and forgiveness
0,I remember listening to this on my first transistor radio... Still love it!
0,My favorite song right now.
0,This band is amazing and I have to say I became a fan after hearing Story of my Life on the radio. I had absolutely no idea who they were but was compelled to learn about the band and their music. I am happy to say I have been converted to a full "as the kids would say" Directioner.  Midnight Memories was amazing, and so is their latest four. So if you love 70s and 80s classic rock with a modern twist, then you will love Four. Take a chance and download a copy of this album you won't regret it. Where do broken hearts go, fire proof, 18, fools gold, Stockholm Syndrome, and steal my girl are some of my favorites.  Also if you do discover that you like this album go back and down load Midnight Memories you will not regret that decision I promise.
0,I downloaded this album because I'm having my first baby. Upon listening to the samples, even though I am having a boy, I liked the music enough to get many of the songs off this album for listening to now & for in the future.
0,Love it
0,Great song!

0,Good.
0,Brings back all the great memories of my youth and the music never disappoints.  Highly recommend just to relive those moments.
0,I have to love One Direction , they are everything to my daughter and now I find myself loving everything they do as well. This song rocks!	It's  mine and my daughter's new anthem !!!!!
0,This song has love written all over it. Great early music, 5 stars.
0,Will always love you Prince
0,I want to live my life for the Lord to receive glory. When as believer are lift here on this earth to be salt and light. We are not here just to exist. We are here for His glory. This songs ministers to the affect.
0,I love this beautiful song thank so much!
0,I love Gavin DeGraw, I love the song (Soldier) & I love the ease of downloading pretty much any song I want at any given moment. You don't have to buy the whole CD @ the store anymore. Just get the song(s) you want.
0,Absolutely awesome!  This is one of the best purchases i've ever made for my 11 year old girl!  My daughter put this on her MP3 Player and listens to it all the time.  Amazon does an extraordinary job of their music set-up, it is easy to find things, and, when you have Amazon Prime, it is MORE than worth the money in all the free music provided alone!  Highest recommendations.
0,I like this song, it is really fun and has an awesome beat.
0,Dope track.
0,Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it...
0,I love this one too I what else can I say it's one of my favorites
0,Although I cannot really say that I am an especially huge fan of John Denver, ..I do have to admit that I have liked the track "Annie's Song" ..for some time now.		Perhaps this song is simply one of those prices of music, which I have somehow found hard to forget about.. after I had heard it, or something.  I don't know.		Well, whatever the case may be, I am very glad that I purchased "Annie's Song" as a digital download (mp3 file).  As usual, the sound quality is Excellent.. and the song itself is very nice!
0,Not sure why they want this reviewed.. It's a song. I knew what I was getting and that's what I got..  ????
0,Loved it. Which I could get a video of the performance for my collection.
0,Great music
0,I would recommend this to anyone who likes music, whether they are young or old.  Great song, very upbeat and fun.

0,Love it. It helps me with my tinnitus.
0,Reminds me of ABBA .Has a nice sound .Music to listen to when you need a little encouragement . I enjoy this one .
0,First Listen yesterday, and I enjoyed the work. This is still Rob Zombie, but its different... it's called varying and experimentation people. I think that some people have a clone expectation of some artists. But the sales  numbers have shown that a huge number of people like this  work. Radio got behind this work because the Rob Zombie fan club helped  push a great product. If you listen to what Rob Zombie has said in his so-called  film hiatus  from music, the way he creates is both visual as well as audio. I think this disc is perfectly in tune with his other work, its a different "Vision" maybe, and whilst items like HELLBILLY DELUXE are items I would play more often, if Rob only has 38 Minutes of music for this disc, then so be it, I certainly don't want him to redo the disc and come up with a new disc like AMERICAN MADE MUSIC  TO STRIP BY, which is a remix of another album... even though I do like AMERICAN MADE MUSIC TO STRIP BY.		Take a look at the Booklet in EDUCATED HORSES, and compare it  to the other Booklet in HELLBILLY DELUXE, you can see the imagery difference, different album, same Rob, different Vision.		Give some of the tracks a listen, this album is a good one. Not everyone can produce the amount of material that Alice Cooper  does, but we can hope that they will, however an artist is an artist not a production coffee  machine.
0,GO ADAM..,I DON'T THINK HE CAN MAKE A BAD SONG......
0,What could be better, a classic tune and a classy voice
0,What I expected
0,When I heard that this song was done by the Cardigans' lead singer, I just had to download it. "Lovefool" brings back a lot of memories, because it was really popular in my early high school days and my friends and I used to sing it all the time to annoy each other (although I loved it). Nina's solo effort is quite good, and it is clear that she can sing well on her own, although she occasionally sounds a little nasally. The lyrics are quite thought provoking for a pop song. I hope Nina keeps performing.

0,Yhis is a nice song from the 70s. Their most memorable.
0,This song, along with "Groovin'," are my favorites by The Rascals. A lot of people who don't have access to the album cover to see what they look like would mistake them for a African-American band. This is a great song that never grows old.
0,Loved this song the first time I heard it back in 1992. I still love it to this day.
0,Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it...
0,Happy with the purchase.
0,Love it-Love it, to GOD be the glory and praise now and forever.
0,I've listened to this album so many times in the past and I just cant get over how incredible it is. Everything from the beautifully written lyrics, to 50s Motown sound brought back to the Millennium. I'm really going to miss this gifted woman and I really hope she will be in peace.		1. Love is A Losing Game - Quite possibly the best emotionally driven song ever written and produced. This song has been on constant repeat since I bought the album.		2. Wake Up Alone - So unbelievably sad, but so honest and truthful. Lyrics once again prove that she had to be lonely and crying writing this one.		3. Rehab - Once again, the lyrics tell the truth of what have ultimately took her life. Its scary to see that an instrumental so happy and fun sounding reflects such ironic depressing lyrics but this is the song I fell in love with in the first place.		4. Back to Black - Wow, another strong powerful song about a deceitful lover. Man I can totally relate to this track...		5. Me and Mrs. Jones - Probably the most witty, funny song on the Cd but so catchy and fun to sing too.
0,Very satisfied.

0,Negasonic Teenage Warhead is my favorite by far on here but there's some other good tunes that grow on you. Like mold.
0,Another great hit from TobyMac!!  I would definitely recommend buying this song, you won't be disappointed!! It's a little simple song, that you can't help but sing along with, whenever you hear it - even the kids can't help it but sing!
0,I love James Bay, and I'm so glad I got the deluxe edition of this album.  So many songs with only a few repeats (different versions).  He's a great singer with that bluesy rough soul style.  I can't stop listening!
0,NO matter how hard I try I will NEVER be able to get the movie WAYNE'S WORLD out of my hear when I hear this song!
0,Awesome song, already part of worship setlist.

0,I have always been a blues guitar fan.	The guitar has always been my favorite instrument to listen to.	Over the years I have not listened to a lot of Jazz. I do appreciate a good jazz musician though, and Benson is one of them.	The first time I heard the CD, years ago when it first came out.	I could not believe my ears. The Sound was incredible and the guitar was exquisite. i truely wish there were more jazz guitar players with this kind of talent. If there were I would probably listen to jazz as much as I do the blues.	George Benson has come up with a very fine album.	This is one of those albums you play at night while you are in bed and listening to music. I often listen to music at night and I love the mood this artist gets you into.	This Masquerade which was written by Leon Russel and was a major hit for Benson. This to me is the classic Jazz album of all time. This is the master with his grammy winning album. Need I say more?	The album is very good from the first note to the last note.	We simply do not have enough jazz guitar players around, and an album like this proves it.................
0,I like this song because it has that reggie/pop thing going. It is a catchy beat that will get you to move to the beat. I don't know if Eddie Grant was a one hit wonder or not. I just know he made a name for himself with this song.		Kris L. CocKayne
0,Led Zeppelin had progressed from the blues roots of "Communication Breakdown" to "Fool in the Rain". An amazing career in rock and an amazing string of albums and radio hits. Nothing they have done since has measured up to what these four gentlemen did for the rock genre.

0,This a great song, and I love it. It's my favorite of Carly Rae Jepsen's. Makes me want to dance around. And yes, I do sing along to this song whenever I hear it.
0,This song is one of those that you just want to sit alone and think about your loved one in life. It makes you ask yourself, is the relationship worth saving, holding on to, or actually walking away from? Its one of a kind. Loved it

0,TVOTR is one of the few newer bands I follow actively. I discovered them after the release of Dear Science, which sounded truly groundbreaking to my ears.  Here were these guys who were my age and grew up with the same music I did (80s synth-pop and alt-rock), who took those influences someplace truly new and different.  Dear Science was "experimental" in the way it combined sounds and ideas from the past and present into something that sounded immediate and had its own very unique character. My appreciation for that album only grew over the years.  Their next one, Nine Types of Light, was also great in that same groundbreaking way but sounded more introverted and reflective even at its harder-rocking moments.  Then nothing from this band for a few years and I wondered where they had gone.		So now TVOTR is back with an album that reminds me instantly how ahead of the pack they are.  The songs are, as other reviewers point out, less overtly experimental than some of the earlier work.  But the songwriting is just as strong as ever and feels more direct with some of the complexity removed.  The music seems more soulful now, with a greater emphasis on vocal harmony. Of course there's still the electronic backdrop and edgy guitar parts, but it all balances well to place the emphasis on the songs themselves.  There isn't a bad track here but so far my favorite is Careful You.		This is certainly worth buying if you have been following TVOTR or want to hear some very modern sounds and interesting ideas.
0,Great music
0,This is his best solo album thus far. I loved his first album, but this tops that one. It might be all over the place musically, but it is solid music.
0,LOL..Yep..I love this song!
0,Cannot complain about the amazon music... great with kindle also... prices are reasonable and love being able to pick songs I want without having to buy the whole album.
0,Between Vangelis and leaving Yes, Jon Anderson finally managed a second solo album four years after "Olias of Sunhillow".  I have the original 1980 Atlantic LP.  It is more varied than the new age flavoured debut.  "Days" and "Some Are Born" were demo-ed for Yes' 1978 LP "Tormato" (they appear on that reissue).  The title track was noted by one fan as solace in a time of loss.  Reissued 2006 by Wounded Bird Records, a reissue label based outside Albany, NY, with mostly WEA catalogue titles for some reason.
0,Love this song, I'm 79 and it makes me want to dance, never too old to be crazy! I'll!
0,It's Great
0,Worthy cover of lita ford and ozzy. Found it was kinda better than the original.

0,A great follow-up to her award winning duet with Jason Aldean and her TV show "Duets," Kelly sings with famed country artist Vince Gill to create a truly lovely song.  It's well sung and it keeps running through my head.  It's one of those "hear it one time and know you'll buy it" songs IMHO.  Enjoy!
0,I purchased the song for the chorus and rhythm. After listening to it a few times there was a message. The injury I sustained from the military made the song meaningful. I hope you like it as much as I do.

0,This is pure classic rock !!!!
0,An artist's sophomore album is often the one where they truly come into their own, and can show off who they are as an artist. It is very rare that the second effort is just as powerful as the debut, and it is the mark of an amazing artist who is able to pull that off. Luckily, Jazmine Sullivan is one of those rare artists who continues the momentum of her debut with her 2010 album, Love Me back. Jazmine is one of the rare artists whose voice alone evokes emotion, making every performance sound personal and passionate. She also marks herself as an artist who is truly "fearless", as her debut title suggested, taking several risks with her new material which nearly always pay off. Although this album is neither as instant, nor as haunting, as her debut, it is an excellent follow-up and one that continues to mark Jazmine as an artist to watch.		Lead single "Holding You Down" immediately showcases Jazmine's incredible voice over track reminiscent of 90s R&B. Despite containing multiple samples, courtesy of Missy Elliott serving as producer, Jazmine easily makes it her own. Although it is not as instantly catchy as debut single "Bust Your Windows", it certainly matches anything on her debut in terms of quality. Second single "10 Seconds" takes on more of the haunting quality that permeated much of Jazmine's debut, as she sings about her giving her man ten seconds to leave after he mistreats her. Jazmine delivers an extremely passionate performance, with just the right balance of anger with a touch of sadness. The bridge is particularly strong.  "Good Enough" depicts Jazmine at her most independent, telling a man that she refuses to waste her time on someone that does not appreciate her. The lyrics are relatively simple and straightforward, doing an excellent job of showcasing the song's message. It's a creative take on a break-up song, with the woman acknowledging that she's been unappreciated yet simultaneously realizing that she can, and will, do better.		"Don't Make Me Wait" is the album's first truly upbeat track, and a fan favourite likely due to the similarities to Prince. Although it is not a personal favourite, it is a nice change of pace that keeps the album from becoming too dark. The track does get repetitive in places, but Jazmine's delivery keeps it strong. "Love You Long Time" is another of the album's less memorable tracks, but it is quite a strong filler track. This is one of the rare songs where Jazmine truly sounds happy, focusing on a relationship that is going well. The main problem with this song is that the production is slightly too busy, and almost overwhelms Jazmine's voice which is not an easy feat given how powerful a singer she is. Although it does not necessarily stand out on its own, it is far from a weak track. "Redemption" is another truly haunting track, and one that was quite a big risk. Jazmine nearly raps the verses before belting the chorus, singing about finding redemption for one's mistakes. It is lyrically quite a powerful track, yet as a concept/storyline song it is one that many fans might not appreciate. Like it or not, Jazmine should definitely be credited for her creativity and the fact that was willing to take such a large risk.		"Excuse Me" is Jazmine's first proper love ballad, and it easily proves that she can shine just as much on happy songs as on her darker tracks. Both vocally and lyrically, it does not quite compare to some of her strongest work, however it certainly proves her to be versatile with her subject matter. Her passionate delivery makes her just as believable on a love song as it is on tracks about anger or heartbreak. "U Get On My Nerves", a duet with Ne-Yo, is a bittersweet break-up song in the form of a dialogue between the two singers. This is one of the most highly criticized tracks for everything from a supposed lack of chemistry between the singers, and for sounding much too "polished" for Jazmine. Although the rawness of her voice is toned down, it does not detract from her ability to evoke emotion. This track is an unexpected standout, and a personal favourite. Despite the complaints, there does seem to be vocal chemistry between the singers, making the track truly believable. "Stuttering" is another rather risky track, where Jazmine literally stutters some of the lyrics. The concept behind this song is that something about a man renders Jazmine nearly speechless, so that when she tries to speak, she ends up stuttering. Luckily, her risk once again pays off to become one of the album's stronger tracks, despite some lyrical weakness. Her vocal performance on this track is more subdued than usual, yet retains its usual passion. It is a creative, somewhat gimmicky, track which ends up working, particularly on the powerful bridge.		"Famous" is yet another highlight, and a personal favourite. Any artist who sings about fame runs the risk of sounding self-centred. However, Jazmine manages to craft a masterful track that truly sounds genuine and even relatable, with vocals that can give chills. Where other artists use songs about fame to complain about the constant attention or to brag about what they have, Jazmine instead describes the desire for fame and to be important. Although this is by far the longest track on the album, Jazmine easily manages to keep it fresh throughout so that it never seems to drag on. This track is truly Jazmine at her best. Despite "Famous" appearing to be the perfect closing track for the album, Jazmine is never one to end her albums on a serious note. Carrying on in a similar vein to "Switch" from her debut, Jazmine closes off this album with the fun, reggae-tinged "Luv Back". This track brings the album full-circle. Where "Holding You Down" described Jazmine questioning why she keeps going back to a troubled relationship, "Luv Back" has her telling a man that she's completely over him and moved on. This track once again proves that Jazmine is just as strong on upbeat and happier tracks as she is with her darker material.		Overall Mark: 4.5/5		Only two albums into her career, Jazmine Sullivan has already established herself as a force to be reckoned with. Both albums so far have been true showcases of her numerous talents as a singer and a songwriter. Love Me Back builds on all of the strengths of Jazmine's debut, especially her ability to take risks with her music. Jazmine is unafraid to try new things with her songs, and more often than not, they work well. The only problem with taking so many risks is that it makes the album a little less cohesive in places, with certain tracks ("Don't Make Me Wait" for instance), sounding a bit out of place. Jazmine still does somewhat better on her darker material than the love ballads, however even the weaker tracks on the album are solid quality. Her passion and ability to evoke emotion from even the simplest lyrics certainly help to make even the weaker tracks sound believable. It will certainly be interesting to see what Jazmine will come out with next.
0,Just like heaven by the cure touches on the idea of being in a relationship with someone who makes you feel like your living paradise on earth. Just like heaven by cure also combines some of the best elements of 80s alternative rock with synth pop.

0,I love this song. Busta & Mariah are great together! Sounds great on my Kindle...I will try it out on the Kindle version on my android phone. Two great music makers!
0,I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.	See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the download, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.	Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you paid the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection during your down load or the power goes out or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you paid for it, its all legal , and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection or the power goes out during your download, you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D	In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:
0,Great party song.  Alan and Jimmy are awesome and rocking on this one.  One of my all time favorite songs.

0,This is another good song from a great group. I think Lady Antebellum could sing the phone book and it would be a hit. I really like just about everything they sing.
0,All the classic Elements that come together to create a Timeless 80's Vibe. An upbeat driving musical tone, while the lyrics have, both a slight melancholy as well as a hint of hope.
0,I love it. This song is now in my music library. Thanks.

0,Awesome song, that sounds great on play back and very good quality. Download was quick and easy, Great purchase overall.
0,Great Cover Song by Alien Ant Farm. Its good to hear songs from the early 2000s still today. Great beat and a nice throwback track. Good to throw in a rock playlist too. Bitrate is 256kbps on Amazon for this song.
0,Great song
0,Wasn't familiar with Emmy the Great, and Tim Wheeler.  I had a chance to listen to this song, and it was free, so I couldn't lose on it.  I checked out other songs, but wasn't left impressed.  Wrong type of music for me I guess.

0,My son and I enjoyed both the story line and music in the movie Frozen. I chose to buy this particular song, Let it Go, because it was nominated for an Academy Award and because Idina Menzel sings it.  I loved her in the musical Rent. And, I also find the song to have an empowering message of acceptance.
0,Excellent product and service.
0,Good song i really like it
0,This is really nice and sweet. It calms me down a lot
0,This melodic and haunting song is a forgotten classic. I loved it when it was new, and I still love to listen to it. It is intelligent and has a melancholy sound that I believe stands the test if time.
0,Very few folks other then me know that DJs referred to this as the "incest song" because, contrary to popular belief, Nancy Sinatra is Frank Sinatra's daughter and not his wife.  Producers made Nancy sing very softly on this so she didn't screw this one up.  Nancy does a very weird low harmony part that has been drastically improved upon by Nicole Kidman on the remake.
0,I don't buy music that I don't love.
0,I just love Billy Currington, he has some great country music, I remember when he started singing, thank you amazon for making it possible to download with no waiting!
0,Good shake your hips song.
0,The song, The Movie are the best! One of the stars has gone. And there will be Purple Rain now that Prince Rodgers Nelson has left us. But he left us with wonderful music to listen to and a #! movie to watch if you're fortunate and blessed enough to have your personal copy. Jehovah watch over you.
0,ok
0,Has Alligator ever put out something awful? Anytime I see that logo in the corner I hot download, especially when it is free music from artists on the rise.
0,Title basically says it all.  The rest of the album is just okay.  Like I said, I'm not a fan.  This song, however, made me stop in the store, look it up, and buy it.
0,One of the best iconic songs from the movie. This is what I heard first and still think when I hear Rocky Horror picture show. Frenetic, fast paced, fun. Don't miss out.
0,great song no download probs
0,I first heard this song in the Doctor Who episode Last of the Time Lords and just recently fell in love with it. It's a really fun song. I'd give it five stars, but if you are a Whovian, specifically of New Who, you know why I gave it 4. ;D
0,Wow wow wow. Who would've thought that a piano ballad would become one of RiRi's most enduring songs? She's dabbled in balladry before (Take a Bow, Russian Roulette), to varying degrees of success, but Stay is by far her biggest ballad thus far, and rightfully so. She strips away the diva attitude and the theatrics and reveals the gifted vocalist that her fans always knew was in her. She lays her heart on the line and exposes her very human and very relatable vulnerabilities and the honesty resonated with listeners all over the world. Say what you want about the fact that she didn't write it - I think she more than made it her own, and Mikky Ekko would agree. After all, that is why he asked to sing this with her.
0,I first heard it on the radio on my computer. Ne-Yo does it again.
0,great song
0,I love buying my music from Amazon. It's quick, it's easy and I buy only the songs that I want. Amazon is the only place I buy music.
0,Requiring someone to write at least twenty words about a piece of music he or she has purchased is just silly.  Music is personal and what I like the next person may not.  So, my comments are irrelevant when all is said and done.  I must say, however, there is a fabulous guitar rif at the end of this that is pure Clapton at his best.  It is even better on the original without Pavarotti.
0,This is one of those laid back musicals that you hear in commercials or in movies or even on the radio but you can't quite place it.  I stumbled apon this one while sampling this album.  Glad I did.
0,One of the best singles I have ever bought.
0,Awesome
0,Heard the song on Dancing With The Stars on TV and found it on Amazon.
0,This is a song from my semi-youth that I simply love.
0,I listen to this song for my exercise. Love it.
0,The music is as expected.  I heard it, liked it, brought it.	I never have much to say about music.  This is why I rarely reply to request	for music reviews
0,An excellent purchase for those who want an introduction to Bach or just to have background or traveling music for those long hauls.  A very worthwhile selection and choice for those who love music.
0,This is a  Song as sad as just about 90% of a lot of Country songs.
0,There's not much to really say here.  It's a song I had to have for my collection of 80's hits.
0,awesome worship music
0,It's been stuck in my head for quite a while now. The remix is fantastic, and the lyrics are surprisingly introspective for a pop song. So yeah...I like it, it's good
0,good song if you want the original that Flo Rida sampled.
0,Gritty band. Gritty music. Not for the faint of heart. I likes 'em.

0,Excellent
0,I dig this song. It's a fun change from some of the same stuff I hear. I plan on checking out the album
0,This is a modern symphony to life that volleys between intensity and sweetness.  There are elements of classical music, heavy metal, rock, tribal beats, alternative riffs, lyricism, and moody keyboard work.		I can't say I loved every track, but it certainly held my interest.  (Some elements reminded me of Wendy Carlos' synthesizer music.)		GHOST would make a great score for a movie, but I'm sure someone has already optioned it.		All in all a worthwhile use of five dollars and your time.
0,I love buying my music from Amazon. It's quick, it's easy and I buy only the songs that I want. Amazon is the only place I buy music.

0,Very nice cd love it
0,The song will minister to you very well if you need reasurrance ,that anything in your life that's going wrong God will Fix it like he said he would.
0,I originally heard this song on TBN during praise-a-thon 2013. The Crabb Family was singing it in the background while the service was going on.  I had never downloaded a Chris Tomlin song before but I loved the words and meaning in this song so I decided to download Tomlin's version. I absolutely love it. If you ever need to be uplifted or just need to be reminded of how awesome and how great the God we serve is just listen to this song. Such an amazing reminder that nothing is impossible with God and as long as God is for us who  can stand against us. Such a wonderful uplifting song. I would recommend it to everyone.
0,I was reading a book that discussed the song "Heart of Rock and Roll" and its origins. I had not heard the song in a while so I looked it up on Amazon. While looking it over I remembered listening to the album on countless family vacations and how many great songs were on it. So I downloaded it to just hear the songs again and relive the past. I have to say the songs still hold up 30 years later.
0,A song a friend of mine requested for his father-in-laws funeral and they loved it, it realy got every one crying.

0,I would hear Kem on the radio, mostly on the stations which focused on playing jazz music and said to myself, "This is just where this artist belongs". I liked his voice from the first time I was introduced to it. It's very unique and befitting for jazz. It has been a long time since I have heard Kem on the radio, but something just compelled me to pick up his debut album and listen closely; I'm glad I did.		Please be warned: The younger generation may not like or appreciate this album. For example, when I was listening to this album, my brother gave me a crazy look and said, "What the hell are you listening to?" On the contrast, my older sister heard me playing the LP and said, "You know about Kem? I didn't know you liked Kem!" I really don't want to limit him to a particular audience, by this really is grown folks music. There is not one up-tempo song  in sight, just slow jams and mid-tempos. Everyone doesn't always like fast music anyway; I'm one of them. I can easily appreciate an album comprised of quiet storm tracks especially since radio plays almost all upbeat music. I get so tired of it, I hardly ever listen to the radio nowadays. "Love Calls" was the first single from "Kemistry" and what a fantastic song it is! Kem makes sure that he croons women and gives the fellers something to think about. This song is very laid back and mellow; it's sure to put one in a romantic mindset. Also, the lyrics are really good. He's letting the listening know that when love calls, there is no where to hide. "Inside" and "Cherish this Moment" are fine moments on the album. These tracks actually bring Sade to mind. I love the hook on "Inside" simply because it's catchy. This album is slightly flawed because it was boring in a few areas, but overall, I was impressed.  He did a fine job.		Mikeisha's Top 5		1. "Inside"	2. "Brotha Man"	3. "Love Calls"	4. "I'm Missin' Your Love"	5. "Miss You"
0,Great!

0,nice song
0,I enjoy this song more today than when it was popular in the 60's.
0,Anyone who has seen the film already knows that the Trevor Jones score is superb, and along comes this limited edition two-CD set that is a MUST HAVE for not only fans of the film but fans of great musical scores. The first disc is the condensed, original album, which has 13 tracks and is 40.7 minutes long. But it's really the second CD that we're looking for, and the reason to buy this set. It contains the same score played during the film, as opposed to selected, shortened tracks. It has 28 tracks and is 1.1 hours. This CD is essential for original score lovers.

0,I have had the DVD for some time now and even burned my own CD's of this show to listen to, simply excellent. I am a big fan of Bon Scott and bet if he saw this he would have approved. Check out the DVD of this one as well. You might just see and hear that over this CD only set. Anyway, if your a hardcore fan or just a fan of Rock n Roll, you'll love this one. This one does NOT disappoint.	Drop by my website at "JudeMac Forever" & see what I have been up too sometime.

0,First of all I like Alan Jackson and most of his recordings.  I like this one as it reminds me of days gone by.  Easy Listening!
0,Slipknot is back! Ive been into this band this the get go. After each album I think they keep getting better and better. But after listening to this album I'm sorry to say I can't say that. The band is tighter than ever heavier than ever and the gutiar riffs are sickiest of any band I've heard in awhile. But after listening to this album a couple of times something just seems to be missing. Its probably heavier than they been since Iowa and with  the production of the first album that sort of at times reminds me of the first album but more mature. But where are the big chorus and catchy melodies that the other albums had. Where are the wait and bleeds, or the psycho socials or before I forgot songs. Don't get me wrong I love their deep cuts too but this album sort of seems rushed to me and its sort of tainted the quality of the music. But the album as so many layers to the music and so much going on maybe it just has to grow on you. Ill keep listening to it and look forward to other releases from one of my favorite bands.
0,Unlike some Megadeth fans I did enjoy 13 quite a bit.  it reminded me of Youthanasia a lot but witha  modern feel.  I certainly wouldn't have complained if it had been more thrashy though, but the song writing was good.  Super Collider was another story.  After initial positive feelings I grew to really dislike about half the album and it was a bit worrisome where Megadeth was headed.  My concern grew with the changing of the lineup again.		Thankfully Dystopia is a return to form for the band and the new members make great contributions to the album.  The album has a good enough sound to it.  It kind of reminds me of a more consistent World Needs a Hero mixed with Endgame.  Oh yes fellow Megadeth fans the metal is back.  The solos are nice.  The band feels rejuvenated and the song writing is pretty solid as well.		Musically this is a solid album.  Everyone plays very well.  Some complain about Dave's vocals but he sounds fine to me.  Sure he doesn't have the voice he use to but he was never a Rob Halford nor  a Bruce Dickinson.  I feel the vocals are done nicely enough.  Dave has a lot of political views in this album, but honestly if you didn't expect him to do that after 30 years then something's wrong with you.  he's been doing that since Peace Sells.		The Threat Is Real 8/10 is a solid thrashy opener witha  nice pace to it and great main riff.  This song kicks you in the teetha nd lets you know Megadeth is a metal band again.  The chorus is only ok, but it's good enough given the rest of the song is so awesome.		Dystopia 6/10 is ok.  It's got some nice guitar licks but I wish it was heavier.  The pace is pretty good and most of the melodies are solid.  the chorus is a bit too repetitive.  Still it's not a terrible song.		Fatal Illusion 6/10 is an ok song.  I like the thrashier section in the second half, but it's got some nice moments.  I don't know this one doesn't do a whole lot for me but it's not bad.		Death From Within 9/10 is probably my favorite song on the standard edition.  It's up tempo with some nice melodies and riffs.  I really like the pacing.		Bullet To The Brain 8/10 This one has a different feel to it especially in the too short verses but I like it.  The build up to the chorus is easily as catchy as the chorus itself.  This is another Dave is pissed off at some chick song.  It's pretty solid though.		Post American World 7/10 This one makes me think of Angry Again.  It's got a nice up tempo to it with the mood being anything but up tempo.  The build to the chorus is slower, and the chorus is faster.  Overall this is a decent song.		Poisonous Shadows 7/10 this one is more mellow but not soft.  There are some points it reminds me of something from Hero maybe Promise but this is a better song.  Even some of the melodies in the chorus remind me of that chorus.  This one is one of the hardest for me to remember.		Look Who's Talking 7/10 is a bonus track i just put it here on my ipod in the album.  It's kind of slower but still reasonably heavy with a faster catchy chorus.  This one isn't bad though the talking vocals in the verses aren't great.  Still an enjoyable song that I'd like to have had on the standard edition.		Lying In State 9/10 another of my favorites.  I love the pacing frantic and thrashy.  The drums and bass work very well with the guitars.  This song is freakin' amazing.  I love the tone of it.		The Emperor 8/10 has the catchiest chorus on the album.  It's got some silly lyrics but it's still a fairly good song.		Foreign Policy 5/10 is some sort of punk cover I assume.  It's got a nice pacing and Dave and the guys do a decent job at it, but I'm just not a big fan of this song.  I've never heard the original but it's just not my thing.  Still it's ok and doesn't require skipping.		Last Dying Wish 6 /10 this is another bonus track.  It's got more talking vocals in the verses.  I'm personally not a fan of those style vocals for a song.  the chorus is ok, but I can see why this is a bonus track.  Still it's not bad and worth listening to.		Melt The Ice Away 6/10 is another cover and another bonus track.  This one is ok I guess, but I've only heard it a couple of times and really don't remember it.		Me Hate You 9/10 This one has a stupid name, but it's a very solid song.  This definitely should have been on the standard edition.  It's up tempo with anger filled lyrics I'd dedicate to Dream theater at the moment, well part of the lyrics anyways.  Its pacing is solid and the chorus is catchy.		Overall this is a really nice Megadeth album.  It's not as good as their classics but it definitely deserves a place in any Megadeth fan's collection.
0,Wife heard this on The Vampire Diaries and feel in love with it. I would suggest that all TVD fans buy this song.
0,Great song!
0,This is the most popular jazz recording of all time. It is recorded by an extremely influential jazz legend who recently passed away.
0,Just a jamming song.
0,I believe Cher is Queen of Pop music. This is by far her BEST cd-there is a song everyone can ejoy on it and just like her first single (THE MUSICS NO GOOD WITH OUT YOU) I don't think POP music would be what it is now without her-CHER.	Cher is LIVING PROOF that if you BELIEVE in you music-it will become a hit.
0,I am from Michigan and there was a radio station that used to play this song every Friday at 5:01	to kick off the weekend. It was dubbed The Friday Song. Great tune.
0,This song was rated as the best country song ever by the experts.  It has all the ingredients--uneturned love for a woman that lasts till death.  Melancholy as heck--the kind of song that makes you cry in your beer, if you were a drinker.  And George Jones's voice is so good at expressing that melancholy and unreturned love that ends only on the day of the man's death...
0,great song

0,I knew the song before i purchased. What can I say?  I like it.  It isn't a song I had so I purchased. it.
0,I think that the title is a bit off. I think that the music is great if you have had a bad day and just need to relax and calm down. It works on sunny days, too!
0,Think that this song is alot better than her first, All about that base, but she's doing well in her career
0,What I have been expected
0,This song has such a catchy rythym that you can't help but tap your toes and then get up and dance along with Paul and Chevy (like in the video).  What hams!
0,Great CD
0,I just like the guitar work in the music; it is somewhat redundant (if you don't like the first thirty seconds, forget it), but if you do, it is great.  It's kind of like CCR's Susie Q; you either like it at the beginning, or you turn it off as the song just sort of keeps repeating itself.  The words are not brilliant, thoughtful, or overly well done, but as I have already said, it's the guitar that makes the song.
0,Great song.

0,Ghostface Killah has been consistent in the two decades of his career. His body of work has rivaled many in the music industry- even if at times the sales didn't match the acclaim. He made a lasting impression on Wu-Tang Clan's debut "Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)". He took things a step further by appearing on another classic album- this time on half the songs on Raekwon's "Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...". His time came in 1996 with his Gold selling RZA produced debut "Ironman", which featured the singles "Daytona 500" and the personal song about living in poverty "All That I Got Is You". After a four year wait- mostly due to constant pushbacks- he released his long awaited sophomore effort "Supreme Clientele". He followed it up with his third and final album for Epic Records- 2001's "Bulletproof Wallets". By 2004, he ended up on Def Jam- where he would put out a lot of material but some of the albums never got the attention they deserved (See: "The Pretty Toney Album" and it's predecessor "Fishscale"). He issued the disappointing "The Big Doe Rehab", followed by his long talked about R&B album "Ghostdini: Wizard Of Poetry In Emerald City". His final album for Def Jam, 2010's "Apollo Kids" was well received, despite the little to no promotion from the label.		In 2012, he signed with The RZA's independent label Soul Temple Entertainment. He made his debut on the label on the soundtrack to the martial arts film "The Man With The Iron Fists"- a film directed by The RZA and executive produced by Quentin Tarantino. His first project under Soul Temple was the concept album "Twelve Reasons To Die". The album was produced solely by Adrian Younge, who also produced the soundtrack to the blaxploitation parody "Black Dynamite". From there, they created an album that was based around the comic book also called "Twelve Reasons To Die". While it is a hip hop album, the production is deep rooted in early 1970's northern soul. He works with several members of the Wu-Tang family, such as Inspectah Deck on the song "Blood On The Cobblestones" as well as "An Unexpected Call (The Set Up)". Masta Ace appears twice also- first on "I Declare War" and again on "Revenge Is Sweet". He teams up with half of Wu-Tang Clan on the song "Murder Spree", although his onetime rhyming partner Raekwon is noticeably absent. After sampling a song by The Delfonics on his 2004's "The Pretty Toney Album", lead singer William Hart returns the favor on the sinister "Enemies All Around Me". Lastly, Ghostface gets help from Cappadonna on the ballad about an untrustworthy woman "The Center Of Attraction". "Twelve Reasons To Die" is a soiid recording from Ghostface Killah. While it's not as strong as his earlier works, it's definitely one to add to the catalogue.

0,I purchased this product, as well as 3 others, to help me fall asleep at night.  this is my favorite one, however.  As one other reviewer noted, it brings back memories of sitting on my front porch during a humid, yet refreshing, summer rain shower.  It works......I have no idea how it ends or when it ends because I am far away in sleepy land before the ending.  It's very much worth a try if you'd like some calming 'white noise' to fall asleep to.  I didn't need to buy 4 different rain/thunder products but I did and I don't regret it.  Pleasant dreams!
0,....but I'm start thinking that bad religion is the greatest punk band on earth....they rule dude....maybe their sound changes in lil' bits but is great....this album deserves everything......just you're(govt...) deserves everything.....so buy it sucka!....
0,I chose this rating for this song because it is awesome and I buy music from amazon all the time the most reliable soource for buying music online.
0,As far as I am concerned, Core 'ngrato is perfection, my favorite of the whole album, so I am biased, but I can listen to it over & over and never tire of it.. a truly incredible sample of the most perfect voice of the century..
0,Good song, maybe even a decent album. But the singer is a rip off of marilyn manson. Don't even try to deny it.
0,Great!
0,This album is excellent from start to finish. I'd highly recommend you check this album out. My favorite track off this album is "Nerve". Buy it, listen to it, and enjoy it.
0,A great old song that reminds one of some very significant matters. Additionally, nice sounds.
0,The song has a great beat and I like listening to the lyrics.  The lyrics has a nice meaning to them.
0,This is one great song.  Adam Lambert may be the "Elvis" of this generation.
0,I really enjoyed listening to  this song, I would suggest listening to this song. I'm getting there other songs also.
0,Better than the original, with "happier" songs and some great arrangements.	Highly recommended!
0,Another solid release from 7L & Esoteric and Inspectah Deck. From Speaking Real Words to Every Hero Needs a Villain, these 3 create great music every time they get together. A definite vibe to hip hop's Golden Age in the 90's....
0,I love this song
0,crystal method's version has music only. filter's lyrics make the song. liked this song since I was a kid. rest of sound kinda blows.
0,good song
0,What a fun album. I love that underlying message of female empowerment.  When I was a kid none of these songs would have made it to the radio  and probably wound up on the news at a mass burning.  We have come a long way baby and this cd proves it. Maybe Ms. Trainor did not  write these songs with the intent of sending out this message but it sure sounds that way to me.  I hope she has much success in the future.  Buy if you want a kicky upbeat selection and I think women will like a whole lot more than men. ( hard to believe this exist in the same world with berkhas,  sorry about the spelling )
0,This is a warm, wonderful song that invokes all that is good about country music ballads. Get out your tissues: this is simply three minutes of hearfelt tenderness.
0,Pretty good West Coast Swing
0,wondeful
0,Awesome music for a reasonable price without buying the whole album... what else can I say. Something to say about the digital age.

0,Great song.
0,This song is a classic.
0,Yes ! when i need that lift  i play that song in a need of a pray it was like god and john walk throught me . cause i was there . on that edge .some of you know what im talking about . i will always come back to jonh pee  key .from the timei seen him live .jesus walk with me . he bless me and where there a john i buy it
0,I hear this song all the time when Im out and I always rush over to check whos singing it. I finally decided to write it down and go in search of the composer. Brooks and Dunn bring this little song to life, and as in so many country tunes, hit a high warballing note that makes me giggle. I cant listen to much of that hi note stuff, but this one is tolerable. I always sing along....it makes me smile
0,so cute
0,Excellent Paul McCartney song. The sound quality is superb. Any fan of Paul or The Beatles should add it to their MP3 library.
0,Got to get this into your heart and it'll stick in your brain like sweet music
0,I love jamming out to this song in my car. It's well written and excellent to listen to everywhere and anywhere.
0,Thanks
0,One of the best!
0,Love this song.  I can listen to it several times in a row
0,This song is a little bit updated version of an old standard and favorite hymn.  I would highly recommend it to any Christian music fan, to anyone who likes contemporary music, any Chris Tomlin fan, or just anyone who likes the song Amazing Grace.  There's enough of the standard/familiar hymn to satisfy the older more traditional crowd while still appealing to the younger more contemporary crowd as well.
0,Perfect
0,Brian Fallon has the gift of writing songs borne of pain and experience and wrapping it all into a three minute hook-laden anthem.  While I was expecting his first solo anthem to be more of just him and an acoustic guitar, we are met instead with a very Gaslight Anthem-like album...which does not disappoint this die-hard Gaslight Anthem fan.  It's a nice mix of Gaslight, Tom Petty, Springsteen, and Bob Dylan, perfectly blending rock, folk, and alt-country.  All too often with solo albums in the past, I have found myself enjoying some of the songs but in the end missing the original band (i.e. Brandon Flowers solo album); however, this album, perhaps because of its similarities in sound as well as Fallon's unmistakable lyrics, does not leave me with that feeling.		Speaking of lyrics, Brian Fallon gives us once again some of his best words to date.  Fallon is famous for both the overall themes of his lyrics as well as his one-liners that cuts you to ribbons each time he sings them with his gravelly yet melodic voice.  There are also the classic and familiar Fallon words we see pop up in songs (like "chains").  Fallon has always written lyrics that have resonated with his listeners with lyrics of love, loss, and youth; since his divorce, though, I feel like he is writing his most personal and haunting lyrics where you have no choice but to take a long drive with him in the passenger seat and feel his pain.		Some of my personal favorite lyrics on this album include: "Well, they brought hearts and daggers, they wrote songs about you; when they tied you up in the rungs of ladders and you never ended up coming home; you just became something like some smoke that I tried too hard to hold" (Smoke); "And they say such foolish things, like 'Love, love, love, love is all you need;' but everything inside is saying 'Danger, baby, love's gonna leave.' So I played your sympathy, have mercy on me; 'cause I've been hurt, I've been stung, by the good name of love, 'til I threw my own heart in the sea...among other foolish things." (Among Other Foolish Things); "And we want love like it was a drug; yeah all we wanted was a little relief. And every heart I held in between, they were painkillers to me, they were painkillers to me. Come get your painkillers from me." (Painkillers); "And there's a hole in you now like the windshield was taken out. And everybody's hurt, and mine ain't the worst; but it's mine and I'm feeling it now...Sometimes I think it's haunted inside this house." (Rosemary).		After a few listens, several songs stick out to me: A Wonderful Life, Painkillers, Among Other Foolish Things, Smoke, Steve McQueen, Nobody Wins, Long Drives, and Honey Magnolia.  And yeah, that's 8 of the 12 songs.  The only sound that has not resonated with me so far is Mojo Hand...can't figure that one out yet.		All in all, this is a near flawless album that fans of Gaslight Anthem and Brian Fallon are sure to love and enjoy with repeated listens.
0,Love Adele and this album.
0,One of my favorites
0,Aerosmith has been one of my favorite bands for years. They've made a lot of great albums and some classics that will never go out of style. This love song has both heart and rock. Great combo!

0,Right now, this song officially tops my playlist on my mp3 player.  I love music that gets me moving, and this song is perfect for that.  It's got a very driving rhythm, and I just enjoy the band anyhow.
0,Great song. I heard this on a You Tube video and just had to have it in my music collection.
0,great song
0,Today - This song has so much truth to it and it is a TIMELESS song. For me, this song I first heard when I was a senior in high school. Our class selected this as our class song for graduation. And we were also given the lyrics as we performed this song for the school. Well fast forward to today...Still love this song but my 45 record of it wore out (scratches) and it was time for a 2013 UPDATE via Amazon music. So happy to have found this MP3 of Today by the The New Christy Minstrels here on Amazon. And I found a website called Lyricstime.com that have all of the words to this song. My volunteer group will be going to a Senior Center soon and performing this song to a group of seniors so I am very glad to have found this song!		This song has such truth and wisdom in it about today what should be focused on.		Highly recommend this song to all!
0,Love this song.
0,One of my FAVS....love the slow sultry sound.  Such a sexy song.
0,They say music soothes the soul, sometimes it lifts the soul up.
0,I never new that the Dixie cups sang Iko Iko and I love this song. I always went around singing it and  never  knew who originated it.
0,There are many agruements of what the best Metallica album was. I have to say that Ride the Lightning was easily their best effort, and might be one of the top 10 metal records ever made. Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10, and every single tune is heavy as hell (except for Call of the Katula, but it does some crunching at the end) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again. True the Master of Puppets is great to, but I don't think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning. Master has really been worn out since I listened to it soooo much, that it really doesnt do it for me anymore. I still love Ride the Lightning as they day I bought it in 1986. ENJOY!
0,Beyonce~Bomb new project!
0,Wilson Pickett's "In the Midnight Hour" is considered by many to be the ultimate R&B experience--a sexy, gritty romantic number familiar to thousands of us who grew up in the Golden Age of R&B music.  The driving beat and oh-so-obvious lyrics show that a lot can be said without having having to laced with profanity like so much of today's so-called music.  Wilson Pickett lives forever in the hearts of R&B fans the world over, with "In the Midnight Hour" as his signature song!
0,great
0,I have a lot of versions of "Amazing Grace". Ms. Collins version is number one so far. A perfect voice for this song. A simple piano accompaniment.  No background razzmatazz to mess it up..
0,Don Henley has definitely NOT "lost it".	If there's a bad track on this album, I haven't found it yet.
0,It's Alannah, what can I saw.  This one was missing from my digital collection.
0,Could very well be one of the best songs of all time. And although many people have tried it, no one has ever pulled off the emotional version that Roberta Flack did.
0,Excellent!
0,Not bad at all!
0,A great blast from the past. It is the brothers at the top of their game.  I am sure many children were conceived while listening to this one particular song.
0,I love this song. It is now in my video library. Thank you very much.
0,Love that song especially  when I feel bad
0,love it.
0,This is a great song.  The lyrics are fun and when it comes to "holy roller, roll over me", it is sung as if it the song itself is on a roller of some sort which makes it fun and interesting.  The music is great and the singer has a fantastic voice which holds your interest.  This group will go far.  Great song with great catchy music.

0,I really enjoy this song and listen to it over and over again. It just remindes you that when you are broken the "potter wants to put you back together again".
0,What can you say, it's a classic for a reason.
0,Great song, IMO. I hate to admit that hearing it in that sorcerer movie actually made me like it a bit more too. Music is so subjective, though, so decide for yourself.
0,good oldie.

0,Maroon 5, need I say more? This song is very catchy, as all their songs really are, and this is a must have for Maroon 5 fans!
0,I have a disabled niece who LOVES music and NY cloud drive on Amazon is a wonderful way to store music for her.  It's so easy to manage.
0,Free
0,If you want one Assoc. song, thuis is it. While Cherish and Windy were sweet and breezy(some pun intended), ther first hit	"Along Comes Mary" is the best evidence of their talents. The opening bars are enchanting and the recorder solo in the middle a nice break. Of course, their harmonies were great, they just were a little too "sugary" for the times. I like this song better now than when it came out. I'd give it 4.5 starts if I could.
0,One of my favorite songs ever, it comes from a super group formed after the demise of Cream. With Steve Winwood of vocals and Eric Clapton on guitar, need more be said. Eric went on to his next super collaboration with Derek and the Dominos
0,I chose this song, because I was strolling thru the music songs, on my Kindle fire and saw it.  I listened to it and bought the single.  I would recommend this song to all the lovers out there.
0,sweet song about people being married for a long time. love the song and would recommend this song and artist
0,Love this Song
0,i had a time when i heard the lyrics about service in the military during the vietnam war.i know i was just a kid but i was really just thinking about the men and women that had their lives on the lines for our country.
0,i love listening to this song when I feel I need a love hug... and feel better.  its a feel good song.
0,good
0,Like it
0,I like the song but it's very repetitive after a while.
0,a REALLY HAPPY SONG!!  LOVE IT!!!
0,This song was extremely big in the late 80s, early 90s. It's simple, but its synth beats and "yodeling" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!
0,Wow! Great collaboration. Wonderful song.
0,Love. Love . Love. Love it
0,Great classic seal song from batman forever. I would definitely recommend this to any retro batman movie fans or seal fans who like his music.
0,i have never heard a bad song from Breaking Benjamin...ever! i'm so glad they are back. I can't wait for the rest of the cd.
0,Good song, being from the south we all love a good ride in a truck out on the back roads
0,A Great Cream song.  One that holds up to time.
0,I received this song in a Facebook post. Remembered how much I used to love hearing it. Now I can listen anytime I want.
0,Showing emotions does not necessitate dreary balladry. Case in point, Jamie XX's In Colours is so richly diverse and complex emotionally on all levels. Whether it is an instrumental track or a guest-vocal one, Jamie XX shows off his polished and intricate compositions and direction. When partners in crime from The XX, Romy Madley-Croft and Oliver Sim join him on tracks See-Saw and Stranger in a Room respectively, magic of a different kind, apart from their main group, is sparked. The best track, Gosh, which also starts the album is simply the track of the year. The instrumental bringing you from the mid-section right to the end will be the most dazzling and emotive thing you will ever hear this year. Not even a certain mega-diva could rival that.
0,Just Love Rihanna songs
0,For me, I have downloaded some music that I like.  It is a catchy tune and it is simply my taste.
0,It's TSO, do I really have to say more?  It's my favorite Christmas song ever.  I never get tired of listening to it.  This song is the best part of the concerts. in my opinion.		BEST INSTRUMENTAL CHRISTMAS SONG EVER!
0,You just can't beat this good old classic.  Wonderful, uplifting music with heart to it!  It has great rhythm and song, and I having grown up in Colorado, it is just the best!!
0,phil collins genesis is awesome i also like there other single "land of confusion" and i also like disturbed's mix of "land of confusion"
0,When you wanted to be a rockstar when you were young and you got really into it and sang in the kitchen for hours for weeks,, This is the song you came up with. A song you wanted people to feel with as much depth as you could at the time with your voice. Oh and while you were singing you didn't have a girlfriend. Oh and you were talking(singing) focusing on everyone else except specifically her so you would appeal to the masses.  All in All a great song and worth its place in history. The instumental is rocking deep. The vocals are worked up and worked on. "I feel you" then the guitar part :) excellent.
0,An extremely powerful song that allows us to see our weaknesses and brokenness while surrendering to the mercy and love of GOD Almighty.

0,How can you not know who 50 Cent is?  50 Cent has done something that hasn't been done in a while.  A COMPLETE DEEBO of the Industry.  Strategy or fate?  A little of both.  His controversial How To Rob garnered much attention.  Then consequently he was shot multiple times and survived through it all. (there's your street cred).  By this time, the bootleg of his supposes debut 'Power Of The Dollar' was hot on the streets and the internet.  Quickly following that, 50 gets dropped from a deal.  Later on he releases Guess Who's Back and again has the streets talking.  By this time his beef with Ja Rule & Murder Inc. is in full effect.  Somehow Eminem gets tapes of 50 Cent and they begin chitter chatter.  Then in an almost assassin like fashion 50 releases THREE mixtapes to the street featuring his crew G-Unit (50 Cent Is The Future, No Mercy No Fear, God's Plan).  Uh oh...now he has the streets on lock...only one more step.  50 Cent signs to Shady Records, features on the biggest hip hop movie soundtrack at the time (8 Mile) and releases his first single entitled "Wanksta" and grabs the media by the throat.  By the time everyones singing on Wanksta, Dr. Dre produces the hit "IN Tha Club", an instant club anthem, and has everybody EAGERLY anticipating the album.  The album soon follows and sells nearly 900, 000 copies the first week...topping Snoop Dogg's debut album record for most copies sold in the first week.  Hook, Line, sinker.	Now about a month after the initial hype I have come to see this album as a modern classic.  It doesn't hold a candle to universal hip hop classics such as Doggystyle, Illmatic, or SouthernPlayalisticCadillacMuzik.  But the reason it's a classic is because 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin has/ will change the game.  And any album that can do that has to be considered a classic.  There are so many standouts on this album...."Back Down", What Up Gangsta, Many Men, In Da Club, Heat, High All The Time, 21 Questions....the whole album is bumpin.  There's no filler and I can definitely play this joint over and over straight through.  Hotness.  The beats are top notch, the lyrics are tight, the flows are on point (even with the slur; but keep in mind he was shot in the jaw/mouth area), the guests don't bog down the album...Overall just a great album.	Just trust me on this one...this cd is definitely a must have.  50 Cent is something special.  I don't know what it is but whatever it is 50 Cent definitely has it.  If he can stay alive...he will do many great things in hip hop.  Let's just hope his talent and controversial lyrics don't lead to another talent being lost.  5 stars!
0,The entire cd is awesome. I recommend this cd to anyone
0,Top Notch Songs, Top notch lyrics, top notch production equals the BEST MELODIC HARD ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!!!  This is not just the best Stryper album ever, it is the best album ever.  100% TOTAL PERFECTION.  Not only does this album Rock your socks off, it also goes straight for your heart with the greatest MESSAGE of all time!!!! From the opening Angelic refrains of "YAHWEH" to the closing scream on "KING OF KINGS", this album is a headbangers delight!!!! Every time you listen to the album it gets better and better.  I'm 51 years old and have been collecting music since I was a kid and I have a couple thousand albums on vinyl and well over 8,000 cds and STRYPER'S "FALLEN" IS THE 1ST PERFECT ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!!!!! DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOR AND GRAB THIS LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH, AT LEAST AS FAR AS MUSIC GOES!!!! If you like heavy music with perfect vocals and awesome background vocals and enough guitar riffs to make Eddie Van Halen swoon, then grab you a copy of Fallen and TURN IT UP!!!!!!!
0,Great product.
0,This is classic Van Halen. Upbeat 80's rock.  Goes well in any 80s collection with others like Journey, Boston, etc..
0,Timesless song that just will always make girls of any age feel good, smile and love live! never gets old!

0,This one "When I Call Your Name" takes me way back!  It's as if he were in the room, singing; it was so clear and beautiful!
0,...mainly for a project I was working on.  But it is also my favorite Christmas song.  I think the version we had in the 60s was on a compilation LP that a cigarette company put out.
0,ENDLESS CLASSIC
0,Yeah!!
0,Just great stuff that doesn't sound much like anyone, occasionally self-consciously arty but they have the chops to pull it off. I play both their albums all the time.
0,"867-5309/Jenny" is a quintessential 80's song and one that helped define the decade.  Whne you hear you immediately know what era it is from.  The song starts with some guiatrs fading in before exploding into the now familar riff.  There have been numerous stories by the songwriter's themselves over whther the number and Jenny are real or just imagine, but in either case the song is as catchy as it gets and the numbers will forever be lodged in your head.
0,awesome artist !!
0,One of thousands of songs that made the era one of variety and talent. Unique and singular, who could possibly pen a tune like this today?

0,Heard this song in a movie and had to have it.. It's very easy to listen to and I love the beat. The kind of song that can get stuck in your head.
0,i really like this
0,I literally just found this and picked up a copy today. Needless to say I Fu**ing Love it ! Seriously man i have been there since their first album. I was 10 years old when my uncle put their first album on,i have been into them since then. They put out another real good album but then i thought they got a little too radio. But this says F**k that ! This reminds me of the oldschool Buckcherry with insane energy. Sick little licks in their while they never let down on some killer grooves. These songs are all genuine and have that classic Buckcherry groove. Solid Ep and i am glad i came across it. It's good to have an old friend come on back through to jam with you. If you know what i'm saying you will enjoy this album.

0,Still singing to this song!
0,Thanks just what I was looking for.
0,If you don't know this song, there's fundamentally wrong with you as a person and a living being. Or else you just haven't heard it yet.		Neat song. A bit dated -- which says a lot for a Christmas tune...
0,I didn't like this song the first time I heard it, but somehow with repeat listening it's really grown on me, and now I love it. I have to sing along with the chorus every time! It reminds me a little bit of an old Peter Gabriel song, although my husband says I'm crazy and he can't hear it.
0,Amazing tune at the right time and for the approiate reasons. Beautiful

0,We all loved Frozen (the movie) and we all loved the songs that are part of it. This is a fun song.
0,In light of Lecrae's Billboard topping success, Grammy award recognition pale in comparison to the reward that comes from serving the Lord faithfully.  And he candidly crafts a song that questions whether or not he has the surefire approach to it all.  Is he scared of the acclaim, has he not been a forthcoming as a disciple of Christ?  Will he hear Jesus say to him "Well done my good and faithful servant"?  In the song "Fear" he carefully weighs those options, and the bass, keys, drums acoustic guitar to the multilingual translation of Psalm 23 are a introspective look at Lecrae's understanding.  And Natalie Lauren's beautiful voice offers encouraging advice to Lecrae's verses to be unafraid.  As people of God we know that the fear of men is a snare, But the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.  Great song, Lecrae!

0,First off I have to say Daley's voice is quite amazing in a soft, sensual way. In a way he vocally reminds me of Miguel who made his mainstream debut with his single "All I Want Is You" featuring J. Cole in 2010. They both have that softer vocal approach. "Remember Me", Daley's debut single is actually the skipper here. It features the new pop artist Jessie J. The rest of the tracks are solid to great. My two favorites are "Blame Game" and "Love Is A Losing Game (Acoustic)" which is an Amy Winehouse song. He slows it down just a tad drawing the song out a little but it works. Vocals are fantastic on this track.		There are a lot of new artists coming from every which way these days but Daley stands out. Not necessarily genre-wise but vocally. I would love to see his career build and hope he doesn't become one of those celebrities in the tabloids for all the wrong reasons. :)		4.3 stars.

0,I saw the Who live and they did every tune on this CD.  Live or in the studio, The Who was one of the Tightest and energetic group of Rock musician's that have walked the planet.  The bass player, John Entwhistle was nickname Thunder Finger's. Several of the songs on this album from the 1970's are still heard daily.  In movie soundtrack's on the radio. Etc.  If you like Rock, you will like this if you have never heard it before.
0,Singer, Songwriter and Musician Eric Benet found himself at a personal and professional crossroads. In spite of a decade that had began with great promise, thanks to his gold-selling and Grammy-nominated Tamia duet, "Spend My Life With You," his reputation as low-key R&B love man was nearly destroyed thanks to acknowledged infidelity against his then-wife, actress Halle Berry. His third CD, the intensely-emotional Hurricane, finally ended his six year recording hiatus and produced a couple of hits, but he didn't completely restore the groove until 2008's Grammy-nominated follow-up, Love & Life. Now, over a decade into his solo career and nearly a decade removed from Hallegate, Mr. Benet's fifth effort, Lost In Time, feels just as well-crafted as its predecessor, giving his faithful following exactly what they expect---lush, love-struck ballads and mid tempos featuring twists of sophistication and sensuality.		When Mr. Benet entered the studio for Love..., he confessed (during an interview to SoulTracks, no less) that he'd sequestered himself in the studio with longtime collaborators George Nash and Demonte, employing old school methods to crank out melodies for the songs rather than the other way around. The process of anchoring lyrics to a strong musical foundation continues to serve him well, evidenced in vintage-sounding tracks like "Always a Reason," which could've been an outtake from a Stylistics album in the way it interpolates "Break Up to Make Up" and employs a tender falsetto to coax his way into a reluctant heart: "There's a lifetime of tears we could both leave behind, cuz' in so many ways, we've been broken inside/All the questions you ask, we'll find answers together in time , all you need is to believe..."		"Never Want to Live Without You" is another blue-light-basement-party special, filled with confessions of a man who's wronged his lady and vows to move faithfully into a brighter future.  The exquisite title track describes the heady sensation that new love creates, and vulnerability reaches new heights with the aching slow-burn of a ballad, "Sometimes I Cry," brimming with tear-stained, Prince-worthy pleading for another chance (or at least a fresh box of Kleenex): "There's a smile on my face, yeah, but I'm broken inside/Sometimes I cry, when I'm all alone with this heart of mine. "		Even the most successful performers need to shake things up from time to time, and that's what Mr. Benet accomplishes, surprisingly, on the Gamble-and-Huff-recalling "Paid." What could've been an ill-fitting and self-conscious duet is, instead, a freely funky jam that laments having more month than money and how the lean green is getting harder and harder to come by. Eddie Levert's baritone complements Mr. Benet's tenor as they grumble about getting "paid on the first, paid on the last, and struggle all through the middle/M-O-N-E-Y never seems to multiply for me," a rich experience for the singers and the audience alike.		Still, in spite of its overall excellence, a few songs in the line-up manage to fall short. "Take It," which pairs him with Chrisette Michele, sounds like a tentative I-don't-want-to-outshine-him/her vocal run instead of the fun frolic it was meant to be, and "Good Life," featuring Ledisi, has a great message but needs a more modern backdrop to really drive it home. "Something's Wrong" wants to wrap up the collection with a conscience, but it seems to contradict itself in stating that, yes, the whip is fly and the cash is flowing, yet the evidence of mankind's suffering isn't exactly making his day, thank you very much: "I avert my eyes as I travel them roads, of people begging on the street/Don't mess up my vibe and show another sick child ain't had enough to eat." Huh?		More nuanced than Hurricane, but less exuberant than Love & Life, Lost in Time---even with its missteps---powerfully demonstrates Mr. Benet's artistic assurance and finesse, qualities that will keep the Milwaukee, WI native from becoming, well, just that.
0,Wonderful arrangement. Would recommend to any Adele, 007 fan. Get it!!
0,This was a good song off of a really good album.  I'm glad I could get such a great price on it through Amazon and I like having it sync wirelessly to my Kindle Fire.
0,Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes is one of my favorite groups along with Teddy Pendergrass.  This was a group that produce a few great sounds that you would love to listen to.

1,heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping. it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review. i guess it's perfect for a furniture store: bland, generic, and soporific
1,Boring, sorry.  Good sound, but the songs just do nothing  for me.  I really admire Yo Yo Ma as a person and artist.
1,This is not the original song its a remake of the song DON'T BUY LIKE I DID
1,Good for granddaughter.
1,It bothers me that the name Last in Line is used here.. I remember seeing an interview of the newest (at the time) Leppard making devil horns and mocking his former boss. Sure we are entitled to forgiveness, but it bother me Ronnie went to his grave despising VC and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory...after RJD has passed no less.		Onto the music. The vocals are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire..he reminds of a better contestant on American Idol. Vivian of coarse rocks but I question the bland guitar amp sound, just doesn't have any punch. Everything else is just by the numbers.		For a band that has taken such an amazing album and title as its name sake they just don't even begin to break new ground, do nothing special with it, and just generally disappoints on every level Ronnie excelled in.		""this time they called in vocalist Andrew Freeman, a guy who has the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the Dio band."" What a joke.
1,did not like it after i got it , i did like the 20 second pre view of it , to bad amazon don't do refunds on mp3's !
1,Ordered by mistake
1,Sold through the Capitol Record Club as a "collector" premium, via his fan club at the time. Latest track on the Lp, "Once More With Feeling," is an Lp filler from TRY A LITTLE KINDNESS Lp, which dates this set into 1970-71 or so.		This album set was packaged with a folded 24" x 36" poster (same photo shot as the front cover of THE GOODTIME ALBUM, Capitol SW 493, roughly August, 1970) and a copy of THE GLEN CAMPBELL SOUVENIR PICTURE BOOK, normally the brown cover version, though some of the earliest runs on this set used the previous yellow cover edition with GC in a WICHITA LINEMAN photo shot.		Beware that used record dealers may split out the extra packaging--the poster and the picture book--to sell separately. This is basically a reissue of the obvious fillers, with some nice extras.

1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,decent club song b or her demon half sasha is telling everybody's she's a legend and a moneymaker please spare us this melosdrama.
1,Live To Win is a great rock song but everything else is just lame cheese and nothing to get excited about. I purchased that 1 mp3 on here and it's worth a buck but skip the rest unless ya like cheesy Kiss music that's not as good as their old stuff.
1,Where's the jive? Where's the fun? This song could have put me to sleep
1,Let me lay the backstory on you first, and Ill begin with the albums title Wednesday Morning, 3AM, debuting in 1964, coming from the fact that on a Wednesday night, our dashing duo had just finished their last song at 3AM in a Greenwich Village folk club, and were homeward bound to their digs in Queens  or perhaps it all had to do with the song Wednesday Morning, 3AM.  Regardless, the iconic photo was taken at that Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street stop.  The photo shoot proved problematic as several hundred images where taken that turned out to be unusable due to an all familiar suggestion that had been penned on the tiled wall, which inspired the writing of the future song A Poem On The Underground Wall, from the album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.		Its not uncommon for an initial outing to be a mixed bag of original material, covers, and arrangements of traditional songs, which was the case here, with their cover of Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin ushering them into the inner circle for all things Bob Dylan, and gaining cross-over fans.  For the most part the album was largely acoustically focused, and largely unremarkable, so unremarkable, along with the invasion of The Beatles, that Simon & Garfunkel broke up, with Paul headed off to the UK, and Art going back to school.  It wouldnt be until the track Sounds Of Silence was reworked as the opening number on their following album, and was presented in a more haunting rock n roll manner, that Simon & Garfunkel secured a place on the musical map and never looked back.		The release was so overshadowed by the Sound Of Silence album that many people completely overlooked it, and with that hit single being on both albums [though as differing versions], it caused confusion for many.  Regardless, what shines most on this release are the traditional and cover songs, where the duo come off as energetic, harmonious, and emotionally sincere.  While sounding sincere and ambitious, the album comes across somewhat disjointed because of this non-original material, and the fact that the songs seemed to have been chosen at random, without consideration for the contextual flow needed for a concise body of work.  While certainly better than their Tom & Jerry [with name taken from the Tom & Jerry cat and mouse comic] material, theyve stepped headlong into an Everly Brothers / Peter, Paul and Mary-ish adaptation, making the album sound a bit flat, thin, campy and uninspired.		Im trying hard to bring something positive to the table, yet in all honesty, there is little I can say about this album to make it seem worth not only your while, but your investment.  The one thing Simon & Garfunkel did, which was similar, though not as dramatic as Dylan at Newport, was that they stepped out of the crooning vocal era of the late 50s, and into the folk scene, and then nearly single handedly reinvented the folk attitude, flying under the banner of folk-rock, though still heavy on the folk side  so yes, in a sense this is an important album as a bookmark of sorts, though holds little of lasting value.

1,not what I expected, just not my style
1,First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.  Everything about this band, about this album, was a waste of time.  This is why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover.  There's no way the music was going to sell this album!
1,Tried something a little different than what I usually listen to; glad I did not pay for this song.  Not my favorite.
1,ben e. king and lieber and stoller are probably rolling in their graves when they heard the desecration of the classic Stand By Me by this music biz hack
1,Please do not purchase this song. This is a horrible version and unfortunately I accidentally purchased it. The original by The Drifters is phenomenal. This, however, is awful.
1,Its Ok.  Not one of my best songs but needed it on my playlist.
1,Really like it.
1,the Dj put a fly beat to an aight song but honestly the song aint wheezy's best but I bught it thining it would fly at the party but neigh so oh whoa iz me research before U purchase
1,Awful. I think this is the worse wiil smith song ever.
1,Can't put in my Galaxy S6 library. Can only hear on cloud. Amazon can't help!
1,A lot of fun.  Great beat!
1,Nice jodeci sound at first but this album is still weak. Nice first verse on "She With The S..." and "#Born Day" is a good club banger.
1,Can't put in my Galaxy S6 library. Can only hear on cloud. Amazon can't help!
1,Got this for free, and have never heard of the band or song title, so have not even listened to it yet. Thanks:)
1,I had all sorts of tech issues. The music itself is great.
1,It won't play this song on my mp3 player! frustrating! I never would have bought it anyway, at least it was free. but still it is frustrating. I ended up just deleting it from my player, it simply wouldn't work. :(
1,Can't hold a candle to the original. That cast didn't need wigs, didn't have to act a whole lot, they were the real thing, they were the hippies of Hair. This is just too cute and wrong. Not even good as a period piece. No talent-director Diane Paulus ruined this as she would Porgy and Bess.  Not even as good as the all-star concert recording of a couple of years ago. Saw Good Morning Starshine performed by the Muppets some years back, and that was more effective than this tripe.	The original still holds up terrifically, get that, skip this.
1,I can't figure out why this song was so popular in the first place?	Only thing I can tell you is stay away from this one. worst song in the 90's period.
1,It"s just OK.
1,I will no longer purchase downloadable music from Amazon or its associated vendors. Even on a brand spanking new computer they won't download, or on the opposite end, download 3 or 5 times. If I can't count on getting what I want, what's the use in trying to purchase it here?
1,I am a Lucinda Williams fan and have been for a long time, but this CD is not her best.  Many of the songs sound the same to me -- sad, slow, boring.  Buy it if you're a long time fan and want to follow her career, otherwise I'd skip it.
1,It's ok.  Needed it for a playlist I did.  They liked it.
1,I didn't like the explicit version at all, the song didn't have the same smooth flow as the non explicit verion did, seemed kind of herky jerky to me.
1,I did not purchase this someone else must of under my account
1,Let me get this straight - he cheats on Miranda with Gwen and yet somehow it's all Miranda's fault and country fans are just gobbling it up? The hypocrisy is unbelievable...No wonder country music is in the sad taste it is right now.
1,the pale emperor is ok cd and only ok. Marilyn Manson have put out better works like antichrist superstar & the golden age of grotesque. fear factory genexus is a 5 start cd. Fear Factory works obsolete & digimortal. progressive Industrial Death Metal music. but if you are a marilyn manson fan I just was wanting better music, and I feel fear factory have realy step up & so have Slipknot the gray chapter.
1,Snoop and Pharrael give a decent melodic mix however snoop needs to hang it up I didn't really enjoy this funk based album
1,J. Walsh said what I thought about this album.  Huey Lewis and the News were a great pop-rock, new wave  sounding band, they did more blues in the past, now they're trying their take on soul. This is not the Huey Lewis and the News we all love.  Huey please try to do another rock album before retiring, I think you can still do it.
1,There has no been question about Mariah Carey. She has been under a lot of pressure to really deliver with a strong cover. She has had a lot of weak cover songs that she has done over the years, from a lackluster cover of Journey's Open Arms, to a mixed cover of Brenda K. Starr's I Still Believe. While her best cover was of The Jackson 5's I'll Be There, she still needs to really deliver. With her latest single, a cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, the second single from her latest album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, she honestly has not done that. The song was absolutely a very weak and less than strong cover for a few reasons. One of them is that she missed recording an entire verse of the song from when Foreigner did it 25 years ago, and the second is that it missed the heart and soul that had been made from the song for years. Next to when Wynonna Judd covered the song a few years ago, this honestly has to be the least-enjoyed version of the Foreigner classic. I thought this was not a good idea for it to be a single from the album, and I was right. Better luck with Memoirs, Mariah. You really are going to need it, badly!!		Song: D 1/2-
1,Sorry, Jerry Lee, time for you to hang it up
1,this is EXACTLY what's wrong with America today (as in the good ol' U.S. of A.):	dumbing it down to the most basic, stupidest, duh-factor possible and people just eat it up (or should I say drink it up).  even the performance is about as rudimentary as teaching pre-schoolers a nursery rhyme on a toy piano.  plink plink plink.		DUH! = $$$		proof once again that money/success has no meaning what-so-ever.  it doesn't point to talent or taste or anything that actually means anything.  this is the same reason the morons on Jersey Snore are rich "stars" too.		And this song is proof that idiots will buy absolutely anything.		easily lead around like sheep much?
1,I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.
1,FNM was a very different band to start with but they had something that drew people to them from many different music styles for better or worse but i think this is there worst  cd yet! this do 0 for me i couldn't listen to more than a few songs at a time and that was more pain full than a tooth extraction! avoid this like the plague or aids! You don't want this!!
1,Because it is important to help companys know that there product is good,and that the people than will enjoy it and buy it.
1,garbage
1,the wife likes it but i don't care for it
1,when the Bangles first came out in the 80's that had a cool vibe about them.they were if you will a Poor Maid's version of the Go-Go Girls.and over time they never quite shook that tag.the Bangles never wrote songs that took off was the big knock against them then&still.some of the Instrumentation is alright in spots but Vocally not much has changed.
1,If you are a fan of those great early Partridge Family albums, then you owe it to yourself to get these, the 1993 Razor & Tie versions and not the recent re-masters of 2000 and 2003. Why? Razor & Tie did not tamper with the sound quality, as a result, Razor & Tie CD's sound like the records you remember. I made the mistake of buying the re-masters thinking they would sound even greater; NOT!
1,If the artist edited the song a bit, it might have worked, because refrain is catchy. But the arrangement is a bit too Broadway/ TV showish
1,this is where alanis was made herself no longer valid in the good music industry.
1,Upbeat song
1,I downloaded this track by accident. This is the live version of the song. I wanted the original studio version.
1,It's okay.
1,I was hoping for more, but there really isn't much here.  The arrangements are very safe and somewhat tedious--there's nothing here that challenges any of the singers.  Some of the vocals sound like they were mailed in, or sent in via attachment on an email.  The choice of songs is rather annoying, too--we've all heard all of these songs over and over in many different versions, and unless you're going to do something new with them, why bother?  Oh, yeah--because you can make a ton of money without having to challenge yourself to do anything creative.  Very disappointing.
1,This song sounds like nothing less than Kool and the Gang's earlier tune "Summer Madness" (minus the awesome synthesizer) circa 1975. Hopefully Paul Hardcastle got authorization to remake this timeless classic. If not, there might be legal issues in the future. Clearly it could be argued that "Summer Madness" is the inspiration for Paul Hardcastle's "No Sress At All".
1,Yep, Madonna has been a has been for a long time. I give her kudos for being a shrewd old shrew in a business sense and also applaud her incessant bids at staying relevant in the entertainment business, which is by nature a fickle beast, with a lingering loyalty only to the almighty dollar. Madonna did this with electronica producer William Orbit back when electronic music became "the thing". All of a sudden, you've got U2, David Bowie, Perry Farrell, Boy George, everyone, trying to be like Chemical Brothers or Prodigy when they were flavour of the month back in the late 90s and early 2000s. Some artists, like Bowie and U2 succeeded and put out good albums that were electronica flavoured. IMO, Madonna's bid fell flat though.
1,not great
1,There is no mistaking that Bruno Mars voice, lyrics and style are all geared torwards being to consumate sensitive ladies' man.  Some of his songs, like "Nothing on You" and "The Way You Are", Mars hits the right notes in being the caring boyfriend, but still being confident and energetic.  "When I Was Your Man" is not nearly as successful.		  In this song, Mars comes off like a whiny, whipped ex-boyfriend.  If you listen to, and read, the lyrics, it's about how he should have catered to every single wish and whim of girl he's singing to but, because he didn't, they are no longer together, and he is moping about it.  Being attentive and caring about your woman is incredibly important, but the degree to which Mars makes it seem like he needs to be in this song, he would be easily controlled and not very interesting to the girl after she got used to be fawned over.		  Mars nails it most of the time.  This wasn't one of them.
1,This free album has various artists & some songs seem like a cross between Country & Rock.	Of the 13 songs kept: "Dirty mouth Flo" is sort of comical , "Gather" is thoughtful & slow , "Gotta Get Back To Forgetting You" good song & good singer , & almost kept "Merseyside" .	Most songs seemed to loud & fast for my liking. Though some people may like a lot more or even less...The whole album is free so make your own decision.
1,When it has came down to this past year for Britney Spears, she struggled from the depths of near fatal death after being placed in a hospital, after a standoff in regards to custody of her kids, to claiming she is back on top with Womanizer. Sadly, though she hasn't really shown that she has the feeling that she has got it again. Circus, the title track from her latest album, doesn't feel like it is the top of her game. I really wasn't impressed with the song. It just wasn't really convincing that she had delivered on a knockout, and that feeling still lingers on after her documentary MTV's For The Record, where she looked and acted like she didn't want to be a singer anymore, because of the casualties. What I think Britney needs to do is take more time to find herself, then get back out there and show she could do it again.		Song: D 1/2-
1,There are sometimes songs that are worth being remixed and sampled that they are better later on. But in the case with covering a song today, it can be as bigger or smaller than when the song had originally came out. Fall Out Boy has had a nice return to the industry a few years ago with Centuries and Uma Thurman. But when I had heard that they were going to do a remake of a classic movie song, I was honestly not impressed with what I had heard. In fact, it sounded much cheaper than when Ray Parker Jr. was accused of stealing from Huey Lewis & The News's hit I Want A New Drug back in the 80's. Fall Out Boy's version of the Ghostbusters (I'm Not Afraid) is honestly one of the cheapest remakes that sounds much worse than what I had first heard years ago. It is not only a poor remake, but definitely is one of those songs that you can easily say, "Boy, did I waste my time on this song!" The guys from Fall Out Boy did better covers before, like their rendition of Michael Jackson's Beat It several years ago. You're better off downloading the original, or the original sample from 1984. This version is definitely not worth the money!!		Song: F
1,don't like this one with the horns playing
1,As the title, cover art, and certain lyrics (read: all the lyrics) imply, this is a breakup record. The difference is that the breakup in question was not a romantic one (or at least I don't think so), but an artistic one - this is the first Elton John album without Bernie Taupin adding lyrics! Gary Osbourne provides them instead, and where Taupin is blindingly misogynistic, Osbourne is sickeningly obvious - honestly, if I hear one more song that contains the lyric "Playin' with my heart!" (i.e. "It Ain't Gonna be Easy"), I will get a bunch of other people who are sick of that lyric together and file a class-action suit against every songwriter who ever used the term, which means a lot of money would exchange hands. The good news is that, musically speaking it's still Elton, and Elton melodies and arrangements were always spot-on - indeed, the strings, guitar, and vibes on "It Ain't Gonna be Easy" are no exception to this rule. All it needs is better lyrics. Sadly, a lot of the "rockers" are bitter pills to swallow: "I Don't Care" is drenched in "good-time" synths; "Part Time Love" seems forced and has a dated guitar tone; "Big Dipper" sounds too much like "Suzie (Dramas)"; "Madness" is the closest Elton's come to arena-rock, and I'm glad he never came anywhere near again. Elton's better off when he sticks with balladeering, on gospel-influenced tracks such as "Shine on Through" and "Georgia" (with the famed Brit referring to it as "his home" - ha! Stupid Gary Osbourne. Was he from Georgia?). And, well... wait a sec? What was I doing praising the ballads? "Shooting Star" is a flaming bag of crap left on Taupin's doorstep! But the synth-drenched beauty of the instrumental "Song for Guy" sure isn't a bag of crap! It's a bit long, but still all right. Unlike most the rest, which is not all right at all.
1,The only solid foundation with you!!!

1,Part 2 is pretty unnecessary. Just go get Part 1, and you'll be better for it.
1,purchased for someone else.
1,First roar & now this stinking up the airwaves & its hitting up the charts? Will she ever go away?	nice going people , You don't know what good music is anymore.
1,this is overproduced garbage. i cannot even tell if i'm listening to iggy, katy perry, or rihanna anymore. all this stuff sounds the same, overproduced and generic
1,the music sucks only got it because it was free
1,Boi if I could get my 99 cents back for this song and in exchange never hear or have this song exist, in a heartbeat, I would happily take it and exchange 89 of those 99 cents for a beefy five layer burrito at the local taco bell.
1,The rhythm and the same notes were drag for a long time on this piece of composition. I do not know was the composer was thinking when he wrote the notes for this music.
1,I bought it to DJ in a party. The song uses extensive use of Auto-Tune - which corrects sour notes and wrong notes sung but leaves those funny sounding artifacts. The weirder the artifact, the more off the note was sung. The singers must be terrible judging from the amount of Auto-Tune used. There are plenty of singers who can sing on-pitch, there is no need to make stars out of ones that can't. I'd give it a one-star review, but the people in the party liked it just fine and the girls got up and danced to it.
1,The production value of this disc left me cold.  Great songs, but did the producers skimp on the budget or what?  Get a drummer with some real chops to liven this up.
1,Fair
1,Didn't get the correct song. Got Guys Have me You instead
1,This album would've been so much better with live instrumentation. I hope her next one will be 100% great like she is on the road with her band....
1,Devan DuBois' "Long Live" is a pseudo blues rocker that puts its Jack White & Black Keys influences front and center.  Mr. DuBois' voice is a dead ringer for Mr. White's, but without the pitch and emotion.  If you want to hear warmed over White Stripes or Black Keys music, then this song will do the trick.
1,More cookie-cutter FM radio friendly Adult-Oriented Alternative?? I am not saying these guys aren't proficient musicians, nor that they are bottom of the mainstream musical dung-pile. I am simply stating that these guys sound like Coldplay sounding like U2. So that makes them pale imitators of pale imitators.
1,I saw this on Zach and Cody and I was like yeah this is my Jam but Jesse is not rad and not popular.
1,It's alright
1,Great song, but this version is too long and overproduced. It isn't the radio version, and although it is a nice song, there is way too much going on. You could hear the song at any given point and think it was a different song. It is also 9 minutes long, which gets a little tiresome. If you are looking for the typical radio version, this is not what you're looking for.
1,garbage
1,totally sucks i like real country music the stuff they pay on pop stations is better than this	ZBb was one of my favrites
1,I haven't seen "Rhythm of the Rain" in the oldies collections hawked on TV and this CD seemed the only way to get that song. The rest of the music on this CD is forgettable.
1,What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.		What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?  She's all over the place.  I think everyone is kinda over it.  She has a great career - nothing to be dissapointed with.  It's just time to retire.  For example - I dind't even know this was released.  Never heard anything about it.  It was never promoted - probably because there's nothing to promote.
1,Elton had cut his ties with his old band in hopes that this would inspire a fresh approach. Unfortunately that didn't work in his case. I bought this in the late seventies when I was hoping that he might enjoy a return to form. No such luck.		The instrumental "Song For Guy" is the highlight and is the sole representation for this album on Elton's 4CD box set. "Part Time Love" was a pleasant enough single for the radio stations that secretaries put on to get them through the workday. Of the rest, only "Shooting Star" might be of note.		There are thousands of great albums waiting to be discovered out there. Unless someone is determined to consume every album issued by Elton John, "A Single Man" is better left to history. I know my copy went to the used record store, not to be replaced by a CD version.
1,REK has always been an alternative country artist & imo an acquired taste which I have never acquired. The real test for me has been how any artist or group sounds live. This AM REK appeared with his bluegrass group on Imus live doing two songs off the new CD. You know your in trouble when your backing band is better than you are, when you mumble the lyrics. Nuff said!
1,I was very dissatisfied with cd.

1,nothing to be taken seriously about this song, it's just for fun, and people shouldn't read too much into it. listen to it on your way home from work, and enjoy the ride.
1,Was a gift not my kind of music
1,I just needed it for a gig!
1,It's got a very familiar sound throughout and if your cool w it...you'll survive. For me, there was a moment of "okay, it's done playing." I didn't want to re listen. Price, bargain though.
1,Racist
1,Papa Bell is cool. Its named after a Negro baseball player from nearly a century ago, led by bouncy island strings and like something from Graceland. The rest of the album is like something from Wasteland. That is to say that the decline of Paul Simon as a songwriter, which began after The Capeman; his best album as far as Im concerned; continues. Its as if hes forgotten how to make good songs, let alone more classics.		Hes still one of my favorite songers, but Id rather him retire than tarnish his legacy any further. Wristband is conceptually akin to The Afterlife from his last album and just as silly. Street Angel brings some interesting hip-hop effects, but structurally the song is a mess. The Werewolf is a grower, but In A Parade never stops sounding stupid. Two short interludes on an album barely over a half-hour long reek of laziness.		He sings of words and melody, but its the latter thats the problem. Paul Simon is still a wordsmith. Its the way he sings those words that, more than anything else, make his new songs mundane. The Capeman mustve robbed him. I can almost count on one hand the good songs hes released since then. Cool Papa Bell is one of them, yes, but good songs on a Paul Simon album are supposed to be the rule, not the exception.		marcellee.com
1,Sorry I got this song, I do not like it at all!!
1,The beauty in this song is unmatched Katy Perry shows why she is a #1 hit making machine with gorgeous powerful vocals that make you feel something every time she opens her mouth and unleashes a rainbow of beautiful unmatched vocals. This is easily the best song of 2010 and quite possibly the best song of the decade!
1,"Oh Sherrie" was Journey lead singer Steve Perry's first solo release.  No one can deny the strength of Mr. Perry's voice, but he is too bombastic on this track.  He goes for the sledgehammer right over your head, when a little more subtleness would have better for a love song written for his girlfriend at the time.  The guitar work sounds a little too much like a knock off of Neal Schoen.  The song was a massive hit in early 1984, peaking at number 3.  It would be his only solo song to crack the top ten.
1,I like the song and already had an MP3 of it in stereo.  The reason I bought this was the length of over 5 minutes led me to believe that this was a longer version of the song.  Instead of that, what I got was the same 2 minute and something song in mono followed by another tune.  While it may seem like a bargain to get two songs for the price of one, I was only interested in it because I thought it was a longer version.  It was very diappointing to me.
1,I just didn't care for this arrangement.  I'm sure many other people will like it very much. It's been deleted from my music.
1,I ran the versions being sold on Amazon through a digital audio workstation and have concluded that they are all subsantially compressed and loudened to compete with so-called modern songs.		If Amazon does decide to offer the un-remastered ORIGINAL tracks from Graceland I will actually buy them.		Until then, look "elsewhere", or hold on to your original Graceland CDs.
1,I don't have any idea about this. I don't even know who this is. so I cant rate it. sorry.
1,Too much background organ noise.
1,i bought it because i wanted to see what the heck everyone would not shut up about. now i regret it
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,good song,not good for this album
1,It is absolutely so sad that whenever someone is talented and tortured doesn't even make really good music that sounds different from what they did before, and the different music that the artist makes, is cheaper from the voice within. It is sad that someone like Rihanna, doesn't deliver with her own work anymore. It is sad that she put all the effort into making the songs for her Anti album, and she hasn't been able to win over new fans from beginning to the end. When I first heard Work, not only was I unimpressed, I really felt her own voice was tired and felt less authentic than before. Kiss It Better, her second track from Anti didn't fair better. Needed Me, the third single from Anti is one song that showed she was trying to be more aggressive in sound, but instead, she just falls back much further along the line. She didn't bring out anything new into the song, and instead Rihanna just misses that songbird mark yet all over again. Perhaps, it is time for Rihanna to just retire. Because we don't need another wannabe.		Song: D
1,Not my style
1,It's alright
1,one of those  artists that had the goods,however he never got the goods. like that Pro Athlete who was top tier talent,however said person	either never had the right coach,system or a complimentary teammate. this  album like so  many of his albums  feel like he outta be singing at a local Holiday Inn with a Lounge band. His  voice is  the truth, however the songs he  gets for the most part tend to lack any fire or substance or juice. he showed promise back in the 90's,however two decades later he settle on a formula and that got him over.
1,Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.
1,Roscoe may have worn himself thin giving everyone else great hooks and not keeping any for himself.  This song is pedestrian at best as far as rapping and production.  The chorus is weak (for Roscoe Dash) so you can skip this one completely.
1,I hope there is more coming because in my honest opinion, this is Rihanna's worst piece of work to date.		It's not a HORRIBLE album overall, but where are the hits? I can almost guarantee not one song off this album will be a #1. Not to mention the majority of these songs are only 1-2 minutes long...this is what we waited 3-4 years for, Rihanna??		I've listened to the entire album numerous times, and there are only about 4 songs that truly stand out to me:	- Work	- Needed Me	- Love On The Brain	- Pose
1,Too short.
1,What a con, I should have looked harder, but Amazon shows an Ablum cover, and expecting to get it all for .69 cents, you get one song.  Its deceptive, but  probably not illegal. But I don't like it, and probably will never use this site angain.
1,The first time I heard this I could not believe it was incubus. I thought it was a joke!  It doesnt sound like them at all.  The lyrics are horrible and they sound as if they were trying way to hard to write "cool" lyrics... I love incubus since their first release but this is seriously the worst song I've heard in a long long time.
1,Can not download to my media player.  Talked to Samjit and Armar in your customer service department, and they really tried to help me, but it did not help.
1,I like Twisted Sister original music but didn't think this was their forte.

1,Alright Ill admit 50 cent can rap; But he's with Eminem! If 50 choose to go a different route then sign with a white boy who is more stale then a box of crackers open for a week. This guy couldn't get a contract or was it about the money? Em cant think of anything so he acts all cool and gobbles up all this bad ass talent, tames them, then the public eats them up and Em makes money off black men. When will someone actully realize what im saying?
1,Trina as ran the last course of her career and this album made me not listen to anymore of the past to now present Trina music. Just like Lil'Kim, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma, Nicki Trashji, Khia, Jacki-O, and all those played out wack rappers the music doesn't last for long.
1,Iggy Azalea tries to fill the gap Nicki Minaj left about 3 years ago after turning completely pop/commercial/crazy. Toss in a little trendy Macklemore & Ryan Lewis style with catchy hooks and lurid topics and try to get as much $ as possible. I'll stick to Foxxy Brown, Lil' Kim and Eve, who at least kept it real back in the days...
1,Yes, even I, with my limited technological skills, can fairly easily make a mix CD/mp3...whatever.  I've got most of these songs on 4 to 5 different sources: single, LP, CD, remastered CD, Archive CD, etc. ad nauseum.  What happened to the original conception for a box set; i.e. to provide an historical, well rounded view of the artist with some rare/previously unreleased (legally) material thrown in to make it more enticing???  No use being longwinded.  There is nothing here to entice a longtime fan who has nearly everything the man has released.  So I draw the line.  I did not buy the last John Lennon remasters,  SHOULD NOT HAVE bought the Harrison Apple years (horrible remasters, only 2 decent LPs ATMP & LIAMW, both already beautifully remastered and reissued), and I will not buy this.  Put out something that I can justify adding to my collection.  I'm tired of buying what I already have.
1,Songs like this should be played on pop stations not on a rock station !	Way to go guys , your ruining metal , nice going and way overplayed.
1,Can't figure this one out.  I got it with something else but I never listen to it.  I wouldn't recommend it.
1,This is terrible. Anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever.	Its so overplayed & way overrated.
1,They sound just like Danity Kane...just don't expect a bunch of great music like "Lemonade","All In a Day's Work" or "Tell Me"...there's only one great song on here called "Going Nowhere"!!!{they snap'd on this song,it's perfect},an a bunch of other o.k songs."Worth It" ft Kid Ink was o.k,also "Like Mariah" ft Tyga{that sample saved that song},"Reflection" & "We Know".
1,this sucked back in 1984 and it does now I will always hate this song.
1,Really surprised by this album. In fact honestly,if I'd actually only listened to it half way and than shut it off I wouldn't see it as meriting a review at all. During the last couple of years I've seen the emergence of a series of albums by contemporary R&B female artists that I'd describe as "high concept" releases. Some are extremely successful both in creative and commercial terms. Janelle Monae's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-ArchAndroid/dp/B002ZFQD0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The ArchAndroid</a>&nbsp;is a perfect example. And that appears to be what Chrisette Michele was going for on her third release. Her first two albums. In her liner notes the concept is abundantly clear. She's decided to address the troubles of the modern day recording industry such as the obsession with surface value and resulting creative crisis's. On that end it's apparent that she has found herself in the middle of one. She isn't sure if the jazzy R&B/funk direction is for her after all. And seems to be changing her mind about her adventure. It all comes into her commentary. You'd think with an album with such a worthy and lofty mission that it would be a masterpiece. It didn't turn out quite that way.		  For one thing there's one simple contradiction. Much in the same way Funkadelic one proclaimed they were "rescuing dance music from the blahs",this album definitely has a similar concept. The problem comes because a lot of the music embraces many of the ideas it's supposed to protect people from. Songs such as "I'm A Star","I Don't Know Why,But I Do" and "The Goodbye Game" all embrace just about every contemporary hip-hop/R&B cliche one can imagine. The bassy techno strains of "So Cool" is even more puzzling at first. It isn't until you listen to some of the other songs do you find out why they are there. There is a title song and it is one of the strongest songs on here. Featuring Talib Kweli it's a powerful modern funk message song speaking about the hypocrisy of modern society,especially in dealing with matters of race and national defense. In an era when topical songs are extremely rare,this really speaks volumes. Another important song is the epic "If Nobody Sang Along". And THAT'S when the commerciality of some of the other songs is explained. As in the liner notes she's filled with a lot of doubt,contemplating selling out for further popularity or sticking to her guns.		  As anyone who reads my reviews a lot know I am not a "cranky reviewer". In fact anything below a four star review is very rare for me these days. The only reason I do so here is because Chrisette Michele is someone whose creative integrity I respect and trust. I completely understand and relate to her conception on this album. And I also support the fact she HAS a concept that's socially relevant. A friend of mine from Oakland had a conversation with me a few years ago about how critical people have become with music and film these days. His contention was that today's trouble was there WASN'T ENOUGH analytical criticism of these art forms in these day and age. That they were all seen as conventional media,little more than commercials and not looked into with more of a fine toothed comb. This album really helps me understand that. The modern cliche's she embraced,even in irony didn't add up to a creatively potent album. The fact she subdued her excellent vocal ability on these tunes didn't help either. If she'd extended the albums two best songs into a full cinematic album concept ala&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/What-s-Going-On/dp/B00007FOMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">What's Going On</a>&nbsp;or Curtis Mayfield's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Back-to-the-World/dp/B000B9WDIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Back to the World</a>&nbsp;it would've been an easy successor to her previous two triumphs. Unfortunately,as it stands this is her most creatively erratic album thus far. Chrisette Michele is still,however a talented lady. Better luck from this point on! She deserves it!
1,The comparisons to Macy Gray, Adele, Angela McCluskey and Amy Winehouse are so painfully obvious you initially wonder if this is parody. Can't fault her too much for having great influences. Gin Wigmore's performance outshines the material with more misses than hits here. Her voice is compelling but with few exceptions, most of this has already been done better by the aforementioned. Standout track- "Hey No".		[..]
1,Meek Mill, is also known as the rising prince of Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group reigning from Philidelphia. Philidelphia is home to some of Hip Hop's legends such as Will Smith, Eve and of course The Roots. Meek Mill is considered the new generation of Hip Hop and to be perfectly honest, he's not doing anything to help it. Meek Mill is known for his brash and in your face personality but thats because he practically yells and shouts in just about every damn track on this album. Now before I start to offend all Meek Mill fans all around, I will admit that the dude is a very aggressive spitter which I can appreciate because I don't think a person can fall asleep while Meek Mill's voice is playing; and he does surprisingly have rhymes scattered throughout the album, but at the end of the day there is nothing substantial here. All that I got from Meek Mill throughout the album is how unnecessarily braggadocios he is as a person. Every track is about rags to riches, getting women, and how much better (he thinks) he is compared to your favorite rapper to an extent. This kind of theme has been done a hundred times over and I am really sick and tired of it, there is nothing inspiring about this guy whatsoever. What he lacks that is important for any rapper is storytelling, and the poor excusese for storylines that are hidden within the album are dry. The sad thing is that Meek Mill trys to tie in his more conceptual tracks, but they just fail to connect.		The beats on this album are no different than what was on Rick Ross's album or his latest MMG compilation that came out not too long ago. The beats literally sounded like one guy produced the entire project, which is sad because when I saw the production credits, every track was produced by a different person, which is preposterous because just about every song had the same bass line and drum samples that Lex Luger would've done (ironically Lex Luger didn't produce anything on this album). "Believe It" feat. Rick Ross is literaly the same beat from BMF (Blowin Money Fast), The first 2 tracks are way too similar in lyrics and beat to even count as 2 different songs and like I said earlier Meek Mill sticks with the same generic flow in every song; his volume, his tone, his range rarely ever changes whether it be a slow or mid-tempo song, and I'm just listening being appalled of how repetitive it is.		If I looked at the lyrics for a Meek Mill song online, than I would expect the lyrics to be in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS and EXLAMATION POINTS for all his verses because thats what I feel I am listening to when Meek Mill raps		By the time I'm finished with track 3, I just comepletely clock out and start skipping tracks quickly until the mood starts to shift into the slower songs like "Amen" feat Drake. When you compare Hip Hop albums by the end of the year with other artists, you will quickly realize that this album is mediocre at best and lacks originality or even a genuwine personality. I haven't heard an album thats this shallow in quite some time. The amazing thing is I was really trying to listen to the album and find songs where Meek Mill raps more introspectively so at least I can get a grasp of what kind of person he was growing up, but ultimately I just found that this guy is 100% boring as a person. The impression I got from Meek Mill is that he is rapping solely for money, not to inspire any of his listeners, not to put out any positive messages, but just putting on a front of being a tough guy or a ladies man 24/7. The only reason why I didn't give this album 1 star is because some of the beats (although extremely similar) do occasionally entertain me when I am driving blasting my speakers. I will never pay any mind to any of Meek Mill's albums again and I know that after a 2 weeks this album will undoubtedly be forgotten. If you want a project from the new generation of Hip Hop that has good storytelling, contains substance, and sounds cohesive? Than check out Kendrick Lamar's "good kid, m. A.A.d city" album or Ab-Soul's "Control System" which are easy contenders for Rap albums of the year.
1,First roar & now this stinking up the airwaves & its hitting up the charts? Will she ever go away?	nice going people , You don't know what good music is anymore.
1,If this is the best song in the 2000's you are sadly mistaken. Anything from this "artist" should not be bought.	Avoid beyonce at all cost. Instead buy my albums on itunes you'll thank me later.
1,What happened Ne-Yo? Everything he touched before this album turned to gold...But as soon as he disappeared for a brief period of time, it seems like he might have lost his touch a bit. I have always been at least a modest fan of Ne-Yo, more so when he first came out, his first two albums were great but as of lately he has wandered to far into the pop genre for me to tolerate. He still has all the talent in the world, and he still is a phenomenal song writer, but his style has changed a lot since he first came out, and Libra Scale is the first album of his that I would say was a definite miss. His last album (2008's Year of The Gentleman) was extremely successful despite being just an average album, but Libra Scale is lacking in both areas. It flopped and was his worst album by far. The production was weak (I don't recognize hardly any names on this album), the songwriting was bland, and just the overall vibe of the album was boring. There were a few standout cuts, the mellow baby maker "Telekinesis" and the mid tempo banger "Makin a Movie" both make lasting impressions, as do the singles "Champagne Life" and "One in a Million", but other than that the rest of the album is filler in my opinion. That was the biggest problem with this album, was there was a severe lack of standout material on the album, and it just didn't sound focused at all, kind of coming off half assed. I mean it's not the worst album i have ever heard by any means, if your a huge Ne-Yo fan you will still get a decent amount of enjoyment out of the album most likely, but as whole the album is definitely lacking, especially compared to some of his better work...Better luck next time Ne-Yo, i know the talent is still there, but this album just didn't display it like some of his other work...
1,Like the other reviewers described this ....Starts out great, then degenerates into rap xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  .. I see no need to cause  offense....That being said, I use this music to make movies, so I just used what  I paid for...The ''good stuff '' and deleted the rest.. { rap }..
1,I did not think too highly of this one, I am not too keen on slow music. Good listening though.
1,Guess I should have taken more time to listen to this before I downloaded suprised me and I don't care to listen to it

1,I would like my money back
1,i don't listen to music due to the fact that music sucks  and i rather be in a quiet room
1,It's the worst thing she's ever done.
1,Wasn't horrible but not for me.
1,Another victim of the loudness war.  Compression & distortion ruin what would otherwise be a fine CD.  Here's a suggestion: Deaf recording engineers are really baaaaad for the end product.  If I wanted to listen to compressed & distorted, --I could always turn on the radio. OverCompression puts a turd in the proverbial punchbowl of fine art.
1,Amy Winehouse is so freakin' ugly, how does she sell albums? A total druggie, alcoholic, and god how much does she weigh, 45 pounds? She is a terrible role model, she is just as bad as Lindsay Lohan. Winehouse can't sing, she thinks she is some rockin' soul singer from the 1960's but she isn't, she is just a wannabe. Take my advice and stay away from this over-rated album, but if you like to hear a troubled and pathetic woman whining about going to rehab which is where she is now, then this album should make you happy.
1,Does anyone even know the REAL song??? This is just a generic dance song compared to the superior, more conscious and politically defiant original. I used to blast it as a radio dj in college until somehow I guess the record label virtually erased it from all airwaves. Political correctness and radio friendly garbage. Smh. Sean Paul wrote a great song and someone made him ruin it!
1,The song has a great beat and I like listening to the lyrics.  The lyrics has a nice meaning to them.
1,Beats are FIRE!!!!! HIS LYRICS ARE BETTER THAN BEFORE BUT STILL WEAK. I really can barely understand what he's saying. Too many bars that don't RHYME. To many phrases repeated. As a DJ I need it for the younger crowd but a T.I., Jeezy, Ludacris or Killa Mike he is not.
1,If I ever hear this song on the radio again by the time I get out of bed ?	I turn the alarm clock off so I won't have to hear this awful singer.	Isn't her 15 minutes up by now ?
1,This is too busy, not true Country and disappointing.  Just another wanna be artist trying to meet Nashiville's misguided expectations.
1,And it's so friggin overplayed too! yuck! time 2 pull out that dung laced vaporizer again! Imo, this was the beginning of the end for Styx, until  Roboto...
1,ya
1,A few months ago I went to a Tantric concert in Louisville, KY because my friend likes them. A band called Silvertide was opening for them, and let me just say Tantric was pahetic compared to them. The crowd sucked, that's why I hate modern alternative rock bands like this...the fan base is as boring as the music. All the people did was stand and watch. At the beginning of one song the Tantric's singer said "This is for all you headbangers and moshers out there" as if he expected someone to actually make a big movement like that, and I hope he didn't, 'cause if he did, he was disappointed. Simply put: the opening band blow the headliners away. How sad is that?
1,He must have been in a lyric slump when he wrote this, it needs more music, a better singer, and a point.
1,Flame is my dude but this album is just iight... Not his best work. Back to the drawing board...
1,Nine brief Country based songs! He dabbles in jazz, country rock & orchestral with horns, strings, etc. Includes a cover of a Nirvana song! Thanx!
1,This mp3 sounds great so my complaint is not about sound quality. However, this song is usually presented as a pairing 'This Beat Goes On/Slippin' To Glide' and it usually happens in a seemless manner. These songs are cult classics and I'm sure the fans out there would love these to be presented in the normal seemless manner. To me it seems like breaking them in two is just a ploy to generate extra revenue. Still, I'm sure fans would pay $2 to have this be one peerless piece of music. I will compare this this to ZZ Top's 'Waitin' The Bus/Jesus Left Chicago' or Queen's 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' - you really shouldn't hear one without the other.
1,Let me just get this out of the way: I was never really a fan of Jewel. I never went out and bought her albums. Still, though, I gave her credit for playing her own instrument and writing her own songs, and being individualistic (at least more so than most of what has been plaguing the radio since the mid-1990's).	BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE???	This really depresses me. And this is coming from someone who was never into Jewel in the first place. Has the music industry really come to this? Where a fairly original artist has to sacrifice all integrity and brains he/she ever had and make meaningless pop drivel just to sell RECORDS!?!?! Talk about a sad state of affairs. I hate to throw around the word "sellout", but...	SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT! SELLOUT!	If you must hear this album, just download it and burn it. Yes, it is possible - we're living in the future, my friends! Remember, we, the consumers, speak with our money. Don't waste it on this, and perhaps, just perhaps, the record companies will wise up. (*scoff* yeah, like that will ever happen...)
1,Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.
1,Racist
1,I haven't seen "Rhythm of the Rain" in the oldies collections hawked on TV and this CD seemed the only way to get that song. The rest of the music on this CD is forgettable.
1,i downloaded this song because it was free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get
1,Some groups, such as Chevelle, don't change their style much over the course of their career and still manage to stay interesting. Breaking Benjamin are not one those groups. The first three albums should some growth and promise, but on Dear Agony and now this disc, theyve become more copy/paste. Several songs on both discs sound too much like songs they had done on previous discs. I had hope that entirely new lineup behind Burley would bring some inspiration and vigor to the band's sound. Instead, it feels like the other members are merely pawns. I will continue to hold out hope that on the next effort, the other band members can help steer the band in a bit of new creative direction, rather than merely recycling what's been done. Like I said, the problem isn't the keeping of their core sound, it's that Ben isn't doing enough to keep it interesting in my opinion.
1,Typical buckcherry
1,Not a Chesney fan, but decent song
1,i didn't purchase this
1,Middling second album has the boyz in top vocal form, but the material they work with here is very, VERY average.  "I'll Make Love to You" is a safe, radio-friendly, G-rated ballad courtesy of Babyface, and even Jam and Lewis stumble on the through-the-motions "On Bended Knee."  Only on "Water Runs Dry" do things get a bit interesting.  It sold a gazillion copies, but does that really speak for album's quality?  Boyz II Men's sophomore offering is not quite a disaster, but it's a very dull record that plays by the rules and does nothing more.  Is that supposed to be progress?
1,Have you ever thought what would happen if you told your parrot to write a song, that sounded like a love song, but actually had a dark meaning, then told the parrot to sing the song, put it on an album? Neither have I, but that logic is what drives this song. Really folks, this song has all the quality of you're parrot doing. Especially the singing, oh gosh the singing...		Overall, a pathetic effort, from a guy that doesn't deserve to see the light of the music world day.
1,This is the elevator version of Dubstep. Something for your mother and I don't think she will like it either.
1,DON'T LIKE IT
1,I didn't like this song, it is worth buying and spending the money on.  Instrumentals and the vocals are poor.  Bad lyrics, says the same thing over and over and seems like a MAN should have did this song.. "strip clubs and dollar bills?".
1,There really isn't anything here worth buying. The song is pretty much just a boring waste of time. It isn't the worst song ever, but the music is pretty lame, the vocals uninspired, the lyrics repetitive and passe. Nothing here i would go out of my way to listen to, and would definitely never pay money for it.
1,The remake of cry me a river by Gabriella Cilmi is a 1000 times better than the original.	Justin quit whining and stop embarassing yourself.	Lessons To Be Learned (Amazon MP3 Exclusive)
1,did not work on my kindle
1,Instructions for listening to this album.		Combine:	1/4th The Final Cut	1/4th Amused To Death	1/4th of a subpar Radiohead tribute band for session musicians	One washed up old man who has not written provocative lyrics since The Wall (1978-1979)		Stir them together		Mix vigorously with a healthy heaping of oppression fetish		Throw the album in the trash bin.		 - -		I have a hard time listening to the same, downtrodden, egocentric, (previous) lyrical genius gripe about the world's ills while writing lyrics from his multi-million dollar home in Manhattan. Even more so after knowing he cleared over a half-billion in revenue from his recent tours. Even an ungodly amount of money, twenty-five years of self-loathing and reflection, and an amazing producer (Godrich) couldn't buy Waters a way out of his self-imposed pity. What's worse is the cheap attempts at "sounding more like old Pink Floyd" by simply restructuring highlights from the album Animals about a half dozen times.		I wish Waters would put his money where his mouth is. A) it might actually help the world rather than whining about it, and, B) It would finally shut him up.
1,Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.
1,Ummmm Amazon this isn't Partition this is the song Yonce. Don't know who needs to be contacted but this isn't even the correct song!		Revision 3.28.14.  Research it a bit found out on the LP version Yonce is featured first then Partition comes along afterward. Sorry Amazon thought y'all made a mistake. Beyonc you need to release Partition as a single!
1,Stupid.
1,song skips so I don't enjoy it
1,A great freebie from our friends at Amazon.  This is one of the best ways to try out new stuff.
1,I think I got this album for free. I thought my nephew would enjoy, but he doesn't listen to it much. Now it just sits around on my computer....		This is my least favourite track on the disk...
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,Ok
1,When it has came down to Mariah Carey and her music right now, she doesn't really deliver. Not just in her music, but her marriage to Nick Cannon has absolutely failed. Her album Me I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse has been absolutely nothing but a big failure. She honestly does not have anymore what she used to, in songs at heart, the artists that really have delivered in voice and soul, and the talent as well. Her latest album hasn't had the songs either. #Beautiful featuring Miguel is definitely not a strong duet heart and soul. Miguel seems to take all the talent away from Mariah, and you really don't have much of her voice in the song. She could've brought out much more into the song, and a better stride. If you are new to Mariah Carey's music, I would absolutely recommend passing this one up for something much better from her like her work back in the 90's. Her songs were there and her voice was stronger.		Song: D+
1,A little Weird Al goes a LOOOOOOOOOONG ways.
1,the song is good but the picture is inappropriate and i don't really know spanish but it is still a good song
1,Decent beat, Indecent lyrics. I think it's the yachty guy that makes listeners throw up.
1,i used to like this song a little bit, but then it got really overplayed and it got really annoying.
1,It seems to be a staple for rock groups to do a ballad, and even show off their softer side. Sometimes it comes off touching and sweet, sometimes darker and more haunting, and sometimes just plain amazing. See Hawk Nelson's brilliantly haunting "Fourteen" for case and point. But then again, sometimes it's just straight up ballad just for ballad's sake. Case in point, Secondhand Serenade's "Fall For You."		This piano ballad is about as boring as it is emotionless and unoriginal, and believe me, this will cause you to fall asleep at the wheel. It may please any AC fan, or any fan of this type of song, but from a guy whose pretty much heard it all, I've heard this one before, and done a whole lot better. However, I may be a sucker for the piano, but the musical work here is pretty good.		So overall, from the vocals to the lyrics, A-Z, 1, 2, 3, this song doesn't do anything for me, except put me to sleep. The whole song was probably written to appease a record exec who wanted something to sell, which isn't bad, except when you put no work into it. Unoriginal and Boring are not desirable qualities I like in my music, so if you're into that, this is for you. I'll just keep my distance.
1,I thought I had a good idea--listen to the great melodies of opera without struggling with foreign languages.  It didn't work out so well.  I counted only 7 good tracks (4, 5, 7, 13, 20, 41 and 49) out of 100.  The rest was intolerable, boring bluster and claptrap.
1,Watched her show in PBS, no real character except for frequent head-shaking.  Not worth buying.
1,This song is really just kind of blah. The vocals seem forced, and it also sounds like the vocalist is really just talking over the guitarist while he/she is trying to play. It isn't very smooth, doesnt really flow, and is kind of just boring. It's not horrible or unlistenable, but i cant imagine going out of my way to listen to this again, and i could easily see myself kind of simply wandering away. Not much here at all.
1,I bought this track because every minute I'd hear it in the 80's.  There's that ever present whimsical sound, I don't know what instrument produces that particular sound.  This tune commands finding out the name of the group, OMD!
1,Ron Isley's first disc since being released from prision, really doesn't have any standout tracks other that What I Miss The Most. The production is boring and I'm surpised R.Kelly didn't contribute anything to the disc or for that matter Ron's label mate Ne-Yo. If Ron Isley wanted to make a remergence into the music scene, then maybe a soulful tribute album would have been better. I'd love to hear Mint Condition on Fight The Power or hear Joe & Raheem Devaughn take on Smooth Sailling.
1,If you ever go to a country music bar, you'll probably hear this song, a real classic!  Love this song!
1,Bought this for a work function, not for me. I am sorry that I could not give a more in-depth review.
1,it seems like every day has been "shorties" birthday ever since the song "in da club" was released. i hate 50 cent. i hate rap music. People these days will like anything that is on the joke now known as MTV. i could go on mtv with a bandana on my head and an apple in my hand and rap about the food chain, and my albums would sell millions of copies. do not by this garbage.
1,dont like to much
1,It sucked like he sucks
1,Awful song! I had to download it for a wedding and will never play it. So sad I had to pay for it!
1,marginal
1,i downloaded this song because it was free and have regreted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get
1,Actually I bought this song I GET WEAK, CIRCLES IN THE SAND, and HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH because I was missing my dead brother and he really liked these songs of hers and it brought back some good memories of him.
1,Sucky song
1,Her first single sounds like Kesha meets Gwen Stefani.  Miss Iggy is clearly very talented, but the lyrics are the same bravado encouraging self-destructive and reckless behavior.  She and so many other stars could really use their talent to lift people up and encourage positive choices.
1,Pink Floyd must be gettin' OLD, (Aren't we all!)
1,Awful material. Only like 3 songs, two of them being singles. She annoys me for some reason. Her singing is okay, nothing really fancy. I don't get the hype with her! Really I don't!!! 		2 deserved stars.
1,Not good
1,Ok
1,Parents do NOT let your children listen to this! This is NOT a song for children! The lyrics are highly sexual and children under 13 should NOT listen to this! The lyrics melt your popsicle means to make a guy wet with excitement. And seriously the song has "all the ass hanging out" and talking about showing their sexual assets to get guys attention. Parents, STOP being stupid. STOP letting your children listen to sex! Just because you don't physically see the sex does not mean the sex is not there! STOP letting your children listen to this!!! BE a GOOD parent for once!
1,Awfully Bad

1,I gave this download only one star because, even though it did download into iTunes on my p.c., I could not get it to sync into my mp3 player as I did with two other songs I purchased from Amazon.com:  'I Can Only Imagine' by MercyMe, and 'All of Creation', also by MercyMe.  If your tech support team can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.
1,Pretty disappointed - a step down from their last work.  Three really good songs, but the rest .....kind of blah...	Pins and Needles, Breaking the Skin and Never Ending Hole = excellent !!
1,Shame on me for ignoring the 19 (1) comments and being swayed by the 259 (5) comments.  I am totally nonplussed how 259 reviewers could give this product a 5 rating.  Please consider another source if you expect to listed to the nostalgic Beatles songs listed in the Amazon product description.  This is not a true audio CD or at least it does not perform like one.  Grassroots Books should have included appropriate caveats regarding this type CD media.  Other than that I agree with most of the negative reviews already posted for Grassroots CDs.
1,A great slow song.  I loved this slow song when I was a teen in high school.  I think it came out immediately after "If I Ever..."  I thought the tall one was sooooooo fiiiiiiine!!!  Not too long after, I became a freshman in college.  Music has always been a great companion of mine.  Their unison's are great.  Harmonies A+.  Their tenor and baritone voices are great in this song.  It's a classic.  They remind me of the guys from "The Platters," I think that's my grandparents generation.
1,I assumed this would have some variance in it, but it is the same bowl being tapped over and over, no overlapping or changes throughout the whole, very long piece. I wonder if they just recorded one gap, then repeated it again and again. There must be better meditational "music" (and I use the term loosely there as it is nothing but the ringing of the bowl -- no other instruments, no melody, no chanting, ... nada) than this. I was very disappointed.
1,this was not Dorothy Moore...I didn't pay attention to this
1,Mary needed a new sound but this ain't cutting it neither. I can hear Banks sound on "follow" & "right now" but those songs still come off as just another o.k song from mary,I can hear Robin S. style on "My Loving" o.k also,"Whole Damn Year" seems to be that cool Mary sound but it still comes off as just o.k."Nobody but you" & "picc me up" are o.k also.
1,I really like this song, but way too many crackling & sounds like a scratch of a needle across a record.  I'm very disappointed with this song purchase.
1,dont listen to music because music bores me and i don't even listen to music at all to begin with
1,I remember the first time I heard Black, from the first album on the radio.  The radio scene at that time had become so stale and boring filled with sissy alt rock bands posing as rock bands that a song with some actual teeth to it stood out amongst the audio fecal matter that was late 90's radio rock. Since getting their first album I've followed this band and they've been one of my favorite bands to come out over the past 20 years. I even have most of their bonus tracks, b sides and soundtrack songs, except the rap influenced stuff which wasn't my thing.  But honestly I think they're running out of ideas.		I loved 2010's Cold Day Memory at first, but as time went on I found that love wore off and now the album is only ok.  Black out the Sun is one of the most forgettable albums I've ever heard, I seriously tried really hard with that one and now we have Kill The Flaw.  The songs just aren't there anymore.  It's not that the material on here is bad.  It's just not memorable.  There are no catchy choruses, no memorable guitar riffs just nothing that makes me want to keep comong back.  Honestly I love a lot of their non album tracks more than these songs, or the songs on the previous album.  The sound is toned down and softer, kind of like Cold Day Memory, and the songs are very basic.  The vocals still sound good, and he has an awesome voice.  The band still has talent.  It's just that their songs have become stale to me.		The album opens with Thank You, which is a pretty solid track.  My only real complaint is I feel the guitars in the verses should have been heavier.  I'd also have sped up the chorus, kind of takes away from the momentum of the song.  But still it's a nice track.  Death Dance is also ok, one I do enjoy but don't really remember much.  The title track and bonus track have their moments and Letters has started to grow on me a bit, but that's about it.  One song has a cool acoustic part, with nice guitar work and a nice drum beat but I feel the slow electric section, when the electric guitars kick in, ruin the pacing of that song.  That part should have been faster too.  Other than that nothing really stands out.  Like I said these songs aren't necessarily bad, in fact there isn't a bad song on here.  They just aren't memorable and don't make me want to come back.  I could listen to tracks 1 and 2 and then stop and be perfectly fine.		Still the album is getting mostly positive reviews, of course on here it's amazon so most albums do, but I still recommend listening to it before getting it.  It's not a terrible album, but these guys are better than this.  If you like the 2 previous albums then you'll probably like this, but I just can't get into this.
1,not what I expected
1,I don't think I've given a Prince record one star in a long time, but this one was practically begging for it.		Prince treads old ground here for at least the fourth or fifth time, delivering a searingly bad message-laden effort accompanied by forgettable music.  At three discs you want to hope that there is something salvageable here, but it's a mash of throw-away tracks that sound like tracks he used to give to other, failed bands.  The "Lotus" record is an airy mess, filled with lazy writing and retread energy.  The "MPLSound" record has all of the funk that was missing on the "Lotus" disc but still fails to do more than frustrate.  Even the welcome return of his sonic palette (hello pitched tom toms!) only elevates these tracks to music I still won't be listening to a week from now.  Finally, there is the included "non-Prince" record, singer Bria Valente's "Elixer" (misspelled for no apparent reason), which is thoroughly produced by Prince.  Valente is not without merit as a vocalist, and of the three records in this set this is the one that doesn't sound like a complete throwaway.  At the same time, it's hardly inspiring.  It's worth noting that this record - not the two proper Prince albums - contains the sole song worth having out of this whole set: the title track "Elixer", which is a powerful slow-grind of a duet with Prince.  That's it: one track worthy of his genius.		I would challenge anyone to find a mere eight songs that would make one good album out of this material, but this 3-panel set doesn't have eight songs on it anyone will care about that isn't on the payroll.  If his vault is filled with 1000 songs of stuff that sounds like this, then someone should forget the combination.  A waste for anyone who isn't a completist or fanatic, who would even have to admit that at 25 albums deep, this one isn't even in the top 15.  If you bought this record AFTER having heard it, you're a very special person, a collector, or you're a person who just likes to collect Prince stuff whether it's good or not.
1,Free download..  kinda blah, but can't resist free...  lol
1,I don't remember purchasing it maybe it was a request for a song that I had to have for a party
1,Just not my cup of tea; much prefer Kenny Rogers' version.
1,I suppose the song is ok, but I really didn't like it.  George Strait can sing them well, but here I think the song just wasn't a good one.
1,There is no qeustion that when an artist seems to be on fire with their music career, they seem to feel like they can do no wrong. Unfortunately for Rihanna, she has hit a massive mistake with her latest mistake, a remix of her song S&M with the auto-tuned Britney Spears. It is honestly a very sad situation. It was one thing for Rihanna to come out a lackluster song, but honestly Rihanna and Britney do not even have any chemistry together at all. It was one thing when Britney did Me Against The Music with Madonna 8 years ago and for Rihanna to score with What's My Name for casual fans, but this is definitely a step into the wrong direction. Should she have a made a better attempt, yes! Especially with someone who has a real voice, and not as a manufactured duet. Hopefully, Rihanna will learn from it, but I doubt she will.		Song: D
1,Let me say first off- I love Redman and still do. 'Dare iz a Darkside' is one of my fav hip-hip lps ever......but seriously.  'Reggie' is horrid. It's sounds nothing like past RM albums, it's plain bubblegum radio station Hip-Pop. C'mon, audio-tune?	I hate to sound this way but this is bad. I know he'll make it up for us but I have nuthing more to say except, do NOT purchase this album. Sorry Red.
1,the cost is too high the return on investment too low and vastly over rated in my mind. Nothing more to say.
1,I've listened to all three tracks in their entirety.  They are worse than disappointing.		These are entirely instrumental versions, no vocals.  But the only "instrument" seems to be a synthesizer, using various [artificial] sounds that sometimes sound like some sort of flute/whistle, and sometimes very slightly like a harp.  Everything is buried in a very deep layer of electronic reverb, entirely unnatural.  Even that is badly done:  in each given medley, when one song ends, the reverb fades out abruptly, instead of dying out "naturally," before the next song starts.  Finally, the "performance" -- if you can call it that -- is very mechanical, with little or no expression.  There's no variation in tempo or in volume.  Me-cha-ni-cal.  Ro-bo-tic.		I have no idea why this is called "Celtic."  It's just cheap synthesizer music, period.  I guess this might be acceptable in an elevator, where you listen for less than a minute before getting out.  But I certainly wouldn't want to sit down and listen to this stuff intentionally.  At least it's not punk or rap.  So in the spirit of Christmas I'll give it two stars instead of one.		If you are expecting real music (played by humans on real instruments), or something that is really Celtic, then skip this collection.  Doesn't Amazon preview this stuff before they unleash it on the public?
1,family member downloaded for their mp3
1,Very slick pop album. One notable exception is a great song about a stalker called Haunted. This song is a keeper. It's nice to finally have a CD burner.
1,Didn't know there was like an interview at the beginning and end of the song.
1,I didn't pay attention to the fact that its the long explicit version of "I'll Be Missing You"  I don't like it and haven't listened to it since I bought it.
1,this is an overproduced piece of dung. just cos u can wail & sing real good don't mean u don't have to b original. Originality still accounts for a lot & u just playin Kneegrowz like chumps when u release overproduced pablum like dis
1,I'm so sad ; I'm so sad ; I'm so sad I'm so sad I'm so sad . I never got this song so I'm not happy and I cry.
1,I selected  this rating because I wanted to be fair. The music is off don't sound like the original beat. These are good song but the beat to these songs are off.	No; I would not recommend this to my friend.
1,Loved his last album but this just wan't the same... Amazing is a good song but it seems like he was trying to be Atlantic's top selling artist instead of tank.
1,Typical Bieber, teamed up with Skrillex. Totally tweeine stuff. Nothing I would play at a wedding reception.
1,This is a disappointing CD.  After watching the show last season, there were several times that I was astounded by what I heard from Jordan.  This CD sounds like it was made in a couple hours.  The recording/production value is very poor.  The songs are bland and generic.  I purchased this without hearing it and I will not do that again.
1,I grew up with Prince and adore 1980-88.	this has nothing to do with that.this is embarrassing.	honestly,since Lovesexy it's gotten worse and worse,and now this?	an all time low just when I thought it couldn't get any worse(20ten).	religion cut Prince's balls and this blood less,sugary nothingness is left.	I almost feel personally betrayed by Prince.	sorry for the rant,I have noone that really understand my disappointment in my childhood hero.	gonna put on Dirty MInd again,then Around the world in a day.masterpieces.	we need remasters!!!	thank you.
1,Multiple SKIPS or DROP-OUTS, the first is at 1:05. There is an annoying POP or click sound at 2:16.
1,people must have fecal excrement in their ears (the ones giving this horrible song 4 and 5 stars) all I hear is more crap...
1,You look at it thinking....wow...what a lot of songs for so little, even if seasonal, still.  But after about 12 the one's I'd rather not of had, it stopped.  I contacted the technicians at Amazon and after two people and many tries I gave up.  So...I've still not gotten to ever get them.  Not a bargain after all.
1,This cd is terrible from start to finish, this just shows you that rap music is in a bad place right now.
1,When it has came down to what Beyonce' has done musically is out of the box release a album with a surprise ordeal of hype. But sadly, the weight of her making a musical leap hasn't actually been the biggest ordeal in music. Her last album 4 was absolutely one of the worst records that she did in her career. But so far, the songs she has came out on her self-titled release Beyonce' doesn't actually feel like anything that really strikes the soul of the voice. XO, the second single from Beyonce' Knowles record doesn't actually bring in the hype in her music, the way she did with her earlier work and her Destiny's Child appeal either. Instead, the song tries and wants to bring her voice into something that Coldplay had done years ago with their melodic and intimate sound. I really didn't find the song worth listening too, and doesn't match what she did as well-played. This XO, is knocked out.		Song: D+
1,The CD was whack  but the videos were really good but imna major big fan of neyo
1,I won't be putting anymore effort forth to give Nehemiah a chance.
1,Not for me
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,Tongue stuck out ... check. Outfit with bits hanging out ... check.  Nude scene ... check.	Two stars because if the song was sung by someone with even a tad of emotional range, this might be OK.	As for it being a reflection of her life, well, no. She didn't write it. Mozella, Moccio, Skarbek, Dr. Luke and Cirkut did. A personal song written by 5 people, huh?		I love me some good pop, but this is not that. Rant over :-)
1,I love the original version of this song. Unfortunately, I didn't listen to this version before purchasing it. When I did listen to it, it was so drawn out,  that I stopped it before it even ended. Wish I would have listed to it before buying it. Bummer.
1,Robin Thicke is a disgusting individual. I bought this song because he states that the meaning of the song is not the objectification of women but it totally is. From having naked women in his video to the asinine lyrics, this song is trash and would love to get my money back.
1,There honestly has been question about Britney Spears, and her comeback album Circus. While she hasn't been able to score that wide-appeal with all the problems she had gone through. While she has had some appeal, the songs aren't really there hand in heart. That honestly has been proof with Radar, the 4th single from Circus. I thought that the song was very weak, and not really filled with the strength that she used to have. I really was honestly not that impressed with the whole album, and this was one of those songs that to me felt like a big, fat snoozer. She needs to try and appeal to a more broader audience, than staying in that same zone she was trying to recapture. It feels like a waste of mind.		Song: F
1,When it has came down to Shakira, she has been a better judge lately on The Voice than a strong singer. While she has had some great songs to begin with like Underneath Your Clothes and Hips Don't Lie, but lately her songs just haven't really hit the nail on the head not for her, but with the people she has recorded with that have been more wasted in voice and heart. Her collaboration with the overexposed Rihanna on Can't Remember To Forget You. the lead single from her self-titled record isn't actually a strong cup of tea from the two of them. In fact, Rihanna throws the song away, not just in heart, but in voice as well. I actually found this collaboration to be worse than even when Shakira collaborated with Beyonce' on Beautiful Liar nearly a decade ago. Perhaps Shakira could find better to not forget when her next collaboration comes out down the road.		Song: D
1,Garbage, for the children!
1,song ok wasn't what i thought it would be
1,I never thought I would give an Emmy Lou Harris recording a C-, but that is what this collabrative CD rates.  It is "so-so" at best.  One song is pretty good, one song is horrid (Black Caffine), and the rest are just not that great.  I am surprised Ms. Harris released the CD.
1,Sorry I got this song, I do not like it at all!!
1,Seemed like the best collection of Beatles songs, but can't give it anything but 1 star because of the packaging.  There are 2 discs in cardboard/paper sleeves.  I assume to keep them in, there is some kind of sticky stuff ON THE CD!!  One, I was able to get it off because it was only on the edge.  But the other, the sticky stuff runs across the CD.  It is not usable.
1,Seriously what are you doing thinking about purchasing, downloading this song. They play it every 3 seconds on the radio.  If you really like this song and listen to the radio, don't buy it because if you wait 3 seconds, I'm sure it will be playing.
1,White Stripes wanna bees!
1,music is n good nowadays in the sense that it is just plain garbage nowadays. only lonny tunes garbage crap
1,There is no doubt about why I named Rihanna the most Overexposed artist of 2008. she has had so many single and videos that have felt like they've been flimsy and lacking a lot of heart. After the lackluster and less than meaningful Disturbia, is is hard to believe she would make a 9th single, yes that is right a 9th single from the album A Good Girl Gone Bad. Rehab, the latest single from that album, feels more like a waste of soul. While the video shows her trying to seduce Justin Timberlake, the song itself doesn't seem to deliver in tune with her voice. It just feels like it is another waste of pop trash. I'd rather recommend Beyonce's recent single If I Were A Boy as a MP3 download for your player over this song. Rihanna just needs to go away for awhile. Not only that, but if you're looking a real rehab song, choose Amy Winehouse's soul-driven Rehab instead.		Song: F
1,A true example of a sophomore jinx. Songs like "10 seconds" an "In Vain" has nice moments but she could've came harder then that. The rest of the album i heard nothing good. I thought after listen to the new single "Dumb" that it was time to stop sleeping on her second lp. I thought i was missing out on something great cause i luv that "Fearless" Album an the new single, but i should've stayed a sleep after listening to the samples a year ago.if You luv "Dumb" and "Fearless" just pass this by...nothing good to hear on this lp.
1,Amazon, how dare you categorize this as Hip-Hop. I never would have predicted Nelly would do a song like this. Straight off the Disney Channel, the sound and lyrics are juvenile. This is embarrassing.
1,I was not inpressed, it was hard to listen to and a major downer, there way a darkness to it that deeply disturbed me. No positive side to it. And the swearing added nothing to it. A waste of my time.
1,I wasn't thrilled by this piece.
1,I ordered the wrong song.
1,not what I expected, just not my style
1,this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.
1,Hugh Van Morrison fan... I was really looking forward to this.  The DVD is stereo only.  The video is fair-ish  Like TV quality, then.  Sound OK but stereo only..... So no I'm not really impressed or happy with this.  For the completest or the got to have your Van Morrison fix no matter what fans....
1,I swear, the beat is Irreplaceable Pt. 2, with the extra, "Hey's" thrown in there. We just can't be original anymore. It's like we'd rather bite someone else's style, and saying it's our own!!		The voice saves the song though. Nothing else. The lyrics are stale, "I'll always have you." Whatever, Jordin. Can we have a little depth, please?!!!!		The music industry is wrong in so many ways.		This is one of them!!		2.4 stars and nothing more for this "music". Melinda or Lakisha could've mopped the floor with her, if only America voted for talent, instead of a pretty face and an overrated beat-boxing wannabe!!!
1,Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
1,I downloaded this because it gets stuck in my head all the time. Its not good. If you haven't heard it, don't start now. Its a pop classic, with breathy vocals and lame creepy lyrics.
1,Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.		In June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him "being guilty of a serious criminal offence". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.		It is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.		This individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.		More mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.		The track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime.
1,When it has came down to Rihanna in music, she has honestly been sadly looked more like a product than a real singer. Not only that, but the quality of her songs have easily made her just as poor as the overexposed Beyonce' and sadly her voice has withered in the process. Her latest record Unapologetic has shown some absolutely poor songs like the weak, Stay. But the song that also started the tracks for Unapologetic, Diamonds, is absolutely not one of her better songs either. She definitely doesn't deliver in voice and heart. I really found this to be one of her weaker ballads, just as much as Unfaithful was on A Girl Like Me. The song has been so overplayed, her voice has died. She might be a diamond in the rough, but Rihanna has lost her own voice into glass. Perhaps she should find better in her own heart than a diamond.		Song: D
1,Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
1,Was sort of looking forward to her new one, but a huge disappointment. Definitely not worth your money. Go elsewhere for a hit than this. Not to mention it greatly sounds like "Brave" by sara bareilles
1,I got this as a gift for big fan of Pink Floyd, but they were sorely disappointed in this CD from Roger Waters.
1,I don't see what people see in this album. I couldn't rate it a 3 even. There are about 3 songs toward the end that are worth having. It's a long way from Olias or Change We Must.	I'm a Yes fan since 75 and Jon's voice is my favorite musical artistry, bar none. But this album is one of his weak ones, as he can produce.	P
1,I did not request or order this song, I do not know how it appear in my account but I was glad when given the opportunity to rate it.  What you hear over and over will eventually pentrate your heart and what is in your heart will fuel your behavior, actions and speech. Look at the condition of the world today and the music that is being made. You have the power to guard your heart.
1,karaoke artist at work lol
1,Downloads ask for last disk.  Unworkable.
1,This was a DOUBLE purchase - another one I wish I would get a CREDIT for!!!!
1,Dre means well with introducing new artists to the populace, but these ones try to hit it hard and not to present the wow to us...Dre does well with his songs.
1,I heard this song on the radio and in the movie Pain and Gain and it sounded so catchy and fun, I had to download it. After hearing it for the third time in my playlist, it always gets skipped because it is annoying. This is one of those songs you come across in a few years and wonder why you ever downloaded it in the first place. Sure, it gets its fair share of shouts when you play it at a party (now) but it will be like Sisco's Song Thong or Snow's Informer in a few years. Obsolete.
1,boy did i get took this is not alabama
1,I have to agree with another reviewer, Michael.  While the song is one of my Beach Boys favorites, this particular remaster sounds very tinny (even by Capitol Records' standards).  The outer ranges are piqued too high and the mid is shoved way down, over-emphasizing the vocal spread and making the instrumentals sound jarring as they move between ranges.
1,This file is of a very poor quality, it reminds me of the vinyl LP's because there is so much static over the complete track.
1,This is a decent song. It is very on-trend with the pop music that is out nowadays, and very within the vein of KP's 'empowerment anthems'. It kind of sounds like something that was left off of Teenage Dream. I can see that this was a song made to be put in some athletic commercial,  one of the leading songs for the Olympics (and possibly World Cup) or any sporting event, due to the stomping mid-tempo beat and the sort of shout-heavy chorus. It is just kind of weird that there are so many borrowed quotes in one song (Eye of the Tiger, I Am Woman, Staying Alive, Muhammad Ali), and rhyming cliches (I went from zero / to my own hero). And upon release there was already controversey that this song relates heavily to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Brave/dp/B00DRDSL4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Brave</a>&nbsp;by Sara Bareilles. I can see this song being number one, but it lacks substance for me. Apparently Katy Perry is trying to come 'darker' with this album, but if Roar is any indication of what is to come, it really just sounds like a lackluster part two to Teenage Dream, or maybe its B-side. Also, the album art is very Lisa Frank-ish.
1,I really like this song, but the crackling in the background makes this song miserable to listen to as it sounds like a needle on a record being scratched across the record.  I'm very disappointed with this purchase.
1,Didn't order it
1,I was blessed with the opportunity to hear this before purchase. I'm not sure if he is just testing us, the fans to see how many will buy anything with his name on it. Sorry but I have to pass.  Is it the worst music ever recorded? No but the fact that it is in the running makes it a sad thing to think about.
1,I love the song, I hate the download. It is flawed, it has errors in it, distortion and garbling towards the end of the track. This is the first time I have experienced this.
1,Bought for a client. Not my taste
1,I didn't mean to buy this song I don't like it
1,Love the song but hate the end where it starts to play another song. It totally ruins my enjoyment of the song. I wish I could get a refund or be offered a version of the song for free that doesn't have the extra bit at the end. Why do they think someone would want that when ordering a single song? Maybe if I had bought the whole album but not for a single.
1,When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them. They have absolutely no chemistry with Sir Paul's classic rhythm and classic songwriting. For Rihanna, it is one of the worst songs she has came out with, and she needs to really find her voice all over again, and for Kanye, it is the most rogue thing he has simply done, and lost his own voice at the same time. For Rihanna fans, she needs much stronger for her next work, and she wasted her own time with low gimmicks.		Song: D
1,Too sad.  Must be a liberal
1,im soooo tired of hearing this song im so glad they have slowed down on playing it make a new song already!!
1,everytime I play it, it cuts off the end...Not sure, was that how it was recorded? or did my download mess up?
1,Nothing special about the song. Can't stand the singer at all.	Yuck. This ain't the one but her husband got away free at last !
1,didn't care for this music.
1,Really wanted to like this album, but it was just weak. Trying to think of a standout track, nothing comes close. Kind of sad to see where he is going.
1,I bought this c.d. for the title track. I thought it was Earth Wind & Fire and found out it was Ramsey Lewis. If I had heard the album first I would have only downloaded the title track.
1,good concept however the song turned out rather boring and my kids do not enjoy listening to it at all.
1,Only got this for a friend.
1,I really like this song, but way too many crackling & sounds like a scratch of a needle across a record.  I'm very disappointed with this song purchase.
1,I agree with the two other reviews saying Stills is tired here.  Nothing is inspiring here and Stills looks like he is going thru the motions.  His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.  He needs Young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and Crosby/Nash to step up his vocals.  I was disappointed with this CD/DVD and will probably  put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while (maybe).
1,What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song. I really found it to be much weaker in the song from Fantasia, while it is more of a song that would fit into Kelly Rowland's sound, or something that Ciara would make. I definitely was not that impressed with the song, and it definitely is Fantasia's low point.		Song: D+
1,It wasn't the song I was thinking about!
1,My kid love this song
1,Eddie and Alex are great.  Background vocals suck.  Dave needs to learn how to sing again and not yell and talk the lyrics.  Oh and maybe sing the melody once in a while.
1,I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?		To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.		After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.		On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.		A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):		I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.		If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as "You're just jealous!" or "I'd like to see you do better!" or "How is it in your parents' basement?" or "You must jerk off to your computer!" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:		"Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!"		FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!		If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.		To those of you who would call me "pretentious" or "music snob" or "self-righteous" or "self-absorbed," you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is "simple," (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:		"Devil's Night Out" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones	"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols" by The Sex Pistols	"The Essential Heart" by Heart	"Highway To Hell" by AC/DC	"Meat Is Murder" by The Smiths	"The Strange Case Of..." by Halestorm	"Greatest Hits" by Tom Petty	"Complete Greatest Hits" by The Cars	"Ugly" by Life of Agony	"Remain In Light" by Talking Heads		As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!		I also wish to point out that arguments such as "Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!" or "You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)
1,Not really a good song
1,Hide your wallets so you can make her go away. gosh this is so replusive. not even worth 1 star. Not worth the hype folks move along.
1,OK
1,Such a poor song with bad vocals and bad lyrics. Sounds the same as anything else nothing new here. Wish there was something good but here there isn't.
1,I bought this to compare to Fergie's "London Bridge". According to my husband, this song has been around for ever (I just never heard it--I must have been living under a rock). I like gwen stefani, I find that she has an interesting vocal range that a lot of her contemporaries do not (ie Fergie, Pink). She has a distinct voice and I really like that. But this song is so high school football that it makes me shudder.
1,This was a replacement CD and made the same error at the same time.  This time asking for a refund. Bad stack of CDs was made.
1,It feels a little too long with the same rhythm.
1,My band decided to start covering this ridiculous pseudo disco excuse for a song so I bought the long version. Big mistake, I should have bought the radio edit and prevented myself from having to sing the whole thing.
1,It was free. So I got it. Not a Jordin Sparks fan but was thinking maybe something free could show some hope. Guess not.
1,I didn't like the explicit version at all, the song didn't have the same smooth flow as the non explicit verion did, seemed kind of herky jerky to me.
1,The good ones just took too long to sift through. If you are looking for a nice X-mas or holiday box I suggest elsewhere
1,makes me wanna start moonwalking around the Christmas tree! ridiculously horrible, played out yuletide turd!
1,When it has came down to what Katy Perry has tried to deliver after the smashing success of California Gurls, she hasn't actually deliver her best as a songstress, and instead delivered nothing more than a weak voice and style to match. Her personal life had shattered with her marriage to Russell Brand ending in divorce and strife, and she has a lot to regain in herself. Roar, the latest from Katy, and the lead single from her upcoming album Prism has a lot of her fans turning heads at her, for a sound too similar to the strong Sara Bareilles song Brave. Katy turns her version of the sampled song, and makes it weak from the ears and heart. While it might be a treat for die hard Katy Perry fans, it definitely isn't one of her better songs. I would definitely pass this one up.		Song: D-
1,After loving this song at first it has now become the most annoying song ever.
1,Nice song
1,Well I went into this movie not knowing anything about the comic book character of Jonah Hex.  In fact I had no idea it even *was* a comic book character.  The description for the movie sounded appealing to me, so I made the horrendous decision to watch it assuming I was going to be impresed by an action flick but.. wow does it ever seriously unquestionably STINK!		Good luck trying to follow along to any kind of storyline.  The pacing of the film mainly focuses around cheesy explosions coming out of nowhere, a woman who works as a prostitute and her daily struggles dealing with men who want to kill her, and people lying dead in the ground coming back to life for a few minutes to reveal important information before quickly slipping back into death again.  I really don't get any of this of course.		Just keep in mind that you probably need to understand the comic book character of Jonah Hex in order to grasp the storyline.  Otherwise you'll be left sitting there totally confused and uninterested in just about everything taking place on screen.		Even without understanding any of the storyline segments, it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to realize the acting is terrible all around.  I'm disappointed because the description said absolutely *nothing* about this movie being based on a comic book because if it had, I surely wouldn't have bothered watching it.
1,Stops in the beginning of the song. money wasted
1,No, I don't want to build a snowman. Are you kidding me? It's June in Las Vegas, why would I want to build a snowman?
1,There is no question that when it has came down to music, Nicki Minaj has honestly been one of the worst acts to have came out with music the past several years. Musically, her last song Stupid H** was so atrocious, it felt like she had gotten her voice chopped off and voice box got seriously injured by a blood clot. Her latest song, Starships is the exact same thing. It really is a terrible song. She really is more like a in-your-face self-centered weezie. Just like Isabel Sanford from The Jeffersons was proclaimed by Sherman Hemsley. I think if Nicki wants to make better music, she should stop and get a better tune with her lyrics before the next time she makes a new album.		Song: D-
1,"Wiggle" is another in a long line of a sub-genre of hip hop that I refer to as 'douche hop'.  It's when the singer is trying so hard to convince you that he's a mack with the ladies, that he just comes off as desperate (Any song by Ray J falls into this category).  After a series of lady-friendly, energetic songs, Jason Derule has has apparently decided to try to be raunchy and tap into his inner R. Kelly.  Alas, he does come off a lot more like Ray J.  First there was "Talk Dirty To Me", now there is this phonic embarrassment, "Wiggle".		  "Wiggle" tries to use the raunchy flute work of many similar songs and Jason tries to go on and on about how he wants to see that lady work it.  But, the flute sounds more like the cheap plastic recorders elementary school kids used and Derulo sounds more like a guy standing on the sideline try learn how to get raunchy with the ladies while watching other, more skilled players, do their thing.		  Derulo would be better served by going back to romancing the ladies from his earlier music.
1,this is a case of yet another pedestrian, average song-played out so bad by the horrible FM Classic Rock format stations that you end up hating it just a little
1,When it honestly has came down the music out there lately, there just hasn't been much when there are definitive songs right now. Even those like Daughtry who had broke out from the shadow from American Idol haven't been able to score a high note. The band's latest single No Surprise, doesn't feel like it honestly is as invigorant as was the case with hard core fans when they broke out a few years ago. I felt that the song wasn't over the top at all. I just thought the song honestly didn't measure up to the feeling they had on songs like What About Now? or Home had. Hopefully, the next single from Daughtry can strike the louder Rock notes that could've been expected.		Song: D
1,When it honestly has came down to Beyonce', she has had so many different singles from her album I Am Sasha Fierce since it came out last year, actually 6 of them. Unfortunately, after her first single If I Were A Boy came out, it all felt like it fell down hill. That sadly is the case is her latest single from I Am Sasha Fierce. Sweet Dreams, the latest single from the album, doesn't really deliver the thrive and feeling that she had done from her earlier albums. I felt that this song wasn't really a definitive song. In fact it was a very weak dream to thrive on. I really think Beyonce' needs to find better songs to make all her own for her next album. The soulfulness she had been known for from her work, and with her Destiny's Child days just haven't been driven on this song.		Song: D
1,Rob Thomas is in the top 2 of greatest musical minds today, and with Matchbox 20 he crafted excellent songs, and some of the best melodies and lyrics the world has seen. However, for reasons still escaping me, he went solo, and this song defines his solo work thus far. Now from what I've said so far, you might say, this must be an awesome song, right? Wrong. The problem with the majority of Thomas' solo work is that the music has the ability to soar, the potential, the need and the want to soar, but like a Penguin, it stays on the ground. How this could be, I don't know. Without the song taking off, it ends up a boring lazy mess, that is topped with a chorus that could have been a whole lot better.		Overall, not a great song to say the least. It's radio-friendly (which I cringe to hear it everytime it comes on), it's poorly done, and most of all, it's just flat-out boring. Sorry Rob, you've done better. A whole lot better.
1,Didn't care for it
1,I don't know what you want me to say about this music but it not worth having. its not good.
1,Never like her first single and never like this song at all !	Quit hogging all the airplay and let the other artists shine for once.	Please stop making music. Purchase my albums instead , you'll thank me later.
1,Yeah give me a hammer so I can smash this song. Oiy Vey! I use to listen to this song when I was a punk but now I am an old lady and this song just nauseated me...
1,A stupid repetitious song.  Real Downer.  I may shoot the finger at Sting for writing and singing this dirge.
1,Good song for love.
1,Like it
1,Stone Sour really surprised me when they did their own version for this song.it just doesn't feel like stone sour,because they are a hard rock band and this is a pop song. Its a decent cover,but wicked game doesn't need to be redone by stone sour. Stone sour isn't good with acoustic songs in my opinion.they should stick to their guns and make good hard rock. I wouldn't waste my money on this single.it really has nothing to offer to fans of stone sour.
1,I owned the vinyl album.  I listened frequently to the vinyl album.  This is NOT the original album version, but an inferior re-recording.

1,I am a 3 Doors Down fan, but I didn't like this album.  It seems like they have tried to go another route, or are tired of each other, or who knows why they changed their sound, but the songs have lost that rock edge that I've loved so much in so much of their other music.  I know that most people prefer the pop-ish songs like Kryptonite, but for me I love songs like Down Poison, which have a distinctively darker edge.  This album is missing that.  If you like the pop-ish songs you might like this album, but if you don't I wouldn't get it.
1,timbaland's beat is boring kanye did'nmt impress me neyo sucks like always keri's alright though swear all this neosoul is sounding more like techno.
1,Gareth is a very nice man, but this soundtrack was, unfortunately, a great disappointment to me.  The main theme recurrent throughout most of the tracks was very similar to the main theme that Masashi Hamauzu used for his Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.  Although somewhat beautiful, the Ori theme so heavily recalled Hamauzu's earlier work that I was unable to enjoy it.  The tracks seemed like remixes of FF13's "The Promise" and "Serah's Theme," and it was impossible to dissociate one from the other.		If Gareth did this by accident, having never been aware of Hamauzu's work, what a dreadful happenstance!  I hope such a mistake never happens to him again--no doubt many composers worry that they might inadvertently seem to be plagiarizing, when they really were not doing so.
1,Deleted from my files.
1,yet another attempt to regain their once great and powerful reputation with yet again new recruits for the band. well they fell very short  save your money
1,John Mayer is a decidedly `hit or miss' kind of artist.  He's a soft-rocker who would be more at home on the Adult Contemporary charts.  But, his sex appeal makes him a mainstream darling.  The tradeoff with that is that he has some songs that are too slow and plodding to be properly enjoyed by some.		  "Waiting on the World to Change" is just such a song.  It wants to inspire people as one of those socially conscious songs about current events.  Some people view this song that way.  However, the music is just too dull for me to care much about the message.
1,Sounds like rap and I don't care a bit for it
1,Tell me, what doctor's office or elevator hasn't been playing this overrated turd constantly. as if we weren't tortured enough with it in the eighties. WHY OH WHY? won't this sucky-azz song, overplayed song  just die a dignified death already!!
1,More Christmas Music?  Why would I order Christmas music oin February?  Please reverse this "purchase".  It gives me a bad taste in my mouth about my new Amazon Kindle.  I am beginning to be afraid to use it.
1,Wiz Khalifa's latest album is nothing more than a huge dissapointment. With NUMEROUS pushbacks in the late 2012 you would think it was to make the product much better. But that didn't seem to be the case here. It's not anything but the lyrics that seems to be the problem here. If you wanna know how much money Wiz has and how much weed he smokes, just listen to this album. He makes more than an obvious point here in about 90% of the songs. I called&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rolling-Papers-Explicit/dp/B004TP6O8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rolling Papers [Explicit</a>] a dissapointment because of the obvious attempts at mainstream pop status, but still a worthwile listen. His colab with Snoop Dogg on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mac-Devin-Go-to-High-School/dp/B005PV1THC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mac & Devin Go to High School</a>&nbsp;was a slight step in the right direction. O.N.I.F.C. (Only N**** In First Class/One Night In First Class) is the worst of all. And one would expect this to be good after the mixtape Taylor Allerdice, which was good as well.		Production heren is good. You can tell that Wiz picked the beats that have the nice long vibing sounds, which is heard all over this album. The best songs on here are the ones he colabs with other artists. "Let It Go" has Akon singing the chorus around Wiz' braggadocious lyrics. "The Bluff" has Cam'ron spitting a good verse. Even 2 Chainz sounds refreshing on "Its Nothin". And his Taylor Gang crew members sound better than him on "The Plan" and "Medicated". The single "Remember You" with The Weeknd sounds good, but having Abel lead off the song and sing the chorus and has Wiz rhyme about something totally different makes the song almost a waste. There are a small number of solo songs that Wiz has that he can hold his own, but don't expect much from those.		O.N.I.F.C. had the potential to be a good album. I for one is very dissapointed after all the pushbacks and delays, this is the best we as fans can get. I think I am done with buying Wiz Khalifa's materal, unless its Taylor Gang or any colaboration albums (*hint, hint* "How Fly 2"). Anything else will be downloaded. Peace
1,Just ok
1,My title is kind of blunt isn't it?  However, the bottom line is that Arc Of A Diver is one medicore recording loaded with excessive synthesizer tones and lacking much in the order of good melodies.	The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.	After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.	Dear Listener, you are best served to pursue Steve Windwood's Traffic career.  These tunes feature some good instrumental definition and some compelling melodies.  Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.  On this record, you have the great two song opener, two more passable tunes(Spanish Dancer, Night Train) and an overabundance of synthesizer drivel that at least to my ears is not worth the investment.
1,I do not let this song.  This song does not included L.L Cool J, Snoop Doggie Dog and other rappers at the end.
1,Katy Perry is really starting to become annoying. Her mediocre songs and terrible attempts at making music are evident. She needs to give it up already. She is terribly over-rated and I don't know why everyone likes her. Likely cause of her looks, like most artists. No talent and all her songs sound the same. The only sound she ever makes in all her songs is ooooooohhhh
1,Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
1,I like Shania. I like "Today Is Your Day". But I liked it better the FIRST time I heard it when it was called "Bubbly" by Colbie Caillat.
1,I liked the first one better more hit's this one not so much.
1,Really, "Beautiful" is the only song that bears repeated listens.  Nothing wrong with the rest...but a band as derivative as this one needs stronger songs to stand out.
1,When you call Enterprise now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight! i have nothing against Rusted Root but, this is a prime example of how overplaying a song can totally ruin it for you! I guess the guys in Rusted Root had to wedge their bets and use the money they're making off of this for their kids' college funds. Who can blame em?
1,Bought it fore my wife ... not my generation of music!!!
1,I see Lil Jon hasn't changed a bit. Still shouting in that raspy voice of his. Guess what buddy? It ain't 2004 anymore. Crunk is dead.
1,1 great song, one ok song.	Now 53 had the great song. waste of money
1,Teardrop, with the mesmerizing vocals of Liz Fraser, is the standout track - unfortunately the rest doesn't quite measure up. Don't get me wrong - Mezzanine is a very "listenable" album, something that works well playing in the background at night (some tracks work especially well for seductive exploits). It's just that the rest of this album sounds like second-rate Portishead.

1,When it has came down to Eminem, he definitely has shown a strike of better craft on his own with his last single from Recovery, Not Afraid. Unfortunately, when there is always a great song coming alive, there can always be a poor song as well. That is honestly the case with Love The Way You Lie with Rihanna, the second single from his Recovery record. I really didn't honestly feel any of the chemistry that the two of them brought down on the song. Eminem delivered as if he was stealing the show well on the track, while Rihanna doesn't feel like she is delivering at a strong strike. It honestly felt much weaker than her last collaboration with Jay-Z and Kanye West on Run This Town last year. Hopefully, the next time Eminem does a collaboration, he can pick someone he has a lot more in common to deliver with.		Song: D
1,i didn't purchase this
1,An stupid some by an stupid kid all about drugs only a piece sh.. Don't buy this crap.
1,got a  chance to  hear this  album and while  Brittany Howard  got a  nice touch on the axe and her  vocals  have moments, this album is just rather run of the mill to me.it has a  steady  groove going which is a slight noticeable different then their first album, however this album gets fairly predictable in a hurry.  there is a  throwback feel involved and yet it never quite gets thrown forward either.
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,Boring and unmemorable, perfect this CGI-laden mess
1,Tried something a little different than what I usually listen to; glad I did not pay for this song.  Not my favorite.
1,I really wanted the edited version, did not like the profanity.
1,Ok
1,.....yeah right!....well,you want a review for this album........ok........this is the worst band in the world..is music for 5 years old brats who think they're cool listening to whining sorry lyrics and boring rappings......if you're into punk listen to real punk bands........what about some wizo.....they are young neither.......or bad religion...they're gods.........don't be a sucka my friend and if you bought this album gave it to your little cousins,......but I don't think they're dumb enough to take it.........
1,Ok track, but nothing special and no where near Rihanna's best work!
1,ok
1,PRODUCTION: 4/8	LYRICS: 4/8	CONTENT: 4/8	ENJOYMENT: 3/8		Selling My Soul starts off decently and then drastically goes downhill after the Part 2, and it does not really recover after that. It has a laid back atmosphere that decently complements Masta Killa's delivery but the majority of the end is either talking or skits. The production is rather all over the place as some have that Wu-Tang trademark sound while others go on a West Coast synthesized appeal. Masta Killa performs decently with his slow delivery, deep lyrics, and somewhat average flow but the lack of solid hooks, too many skit-time, and change in production kills it. Add his weak attempt to sound like ODB (he is paying homage) and you get annoyed. This is more of a backpack album, beware.
1,First roar & now this stinking up the airwaves & its hitting up the charts? Will she ever go away?	nice going people , You don't know what good music is anymore.
1,A lot of the same words and the music goes in circles, they could have done more with it to make it a lot better, I am not sure what, but having less noise in the background would be nice.
1,What's even sadder is that it has spawned a bunch of ripoff version. it's like caca begat caca. It's quite possibly the most annoying song I've heard in a while
1,I am a big Marie fan (since 1976!) but this christmas album is just plain BAD. She scoops the notes all over the place and well, YUK. She's never sounded more like Kathie Lee Gifford than on this CD. I want my $ back because I'll never listen to this again.
1,Sucks
1,Definitely not in the mood for this some of the time. Otherwise they have great voices. Try them out, you might not be disappointed.
1,Racist
1,More pop junk.
1,After amazing albuns "OPERATION MINDCRIME" and "EMPIRE", this was a disapointment for me. Boring at the extreme, overproduced, it clearly show that the band was already losing their creativity vein.
1,It's ok
1,I am not surprised at the glowing reviews here. Most people who review Nicks' music loves her persona as much as, if not more than, her actual abilities. But I look at her music, not just as a fan, but try to listen more objectively. Good artists do not always put out good music.		I like Nicks, though her recent work isn't what I would call stellar. She is more than a decent writer, but if she doesn't have the right producer, her material is banal. It's also not surprising that she, once again, visited old material (just as she did on her last record, and 'Shangri-La' and many on Fleetwood Mac's 'Say You Will' songs as well as their 'Extended Play).  She's been pulling stuff from 'the vaults' for at least a decade and a half  now. '24 Karat Gold' is not a new concept for her.		Had she released the actual demos instead of redos, THAT would have been something worth listening to.		Nicks has a few things going against her with '24'. While her voice might be stronger than it was in the mid-80s, it is also very limited in range. Kids, this is what 3 packs a day will do to you (her admission, not mine). She has very few songs which are arranged with any kind of high note....and I'm not talking them being that high.		Though with the right vocal arrangement, her material can work. She just doesn't have that here.		The other thing she is lacking is a balance of harmonies. She has been working with her two backing singers for 3+ decades and honestly, it worked initially, but that vocal combo is doing Nicks no favors. They are too similar to ever be considered 'harmony vocals'. Though harmony is exactly what Nicks needs to make her songs work.		...and dare I say it...she needs male harmony vocals.		Let's jump right to "Twisted". That song worked back in 1996 because of Lindsey Buckingham's production, arrangement  and yes, harmony vocals. (and let's forget that she released the demo on 'Enchanted' years back....so she's rehashing rehashed songs).		I find the vocals on this record to be very monotone. It goes back to her range, or lack of one.  For the good rhythm of "Mabel Normand", the she rarely moves off of two or three notes, making each line sound like a run-on sentence. The new version of "Cathouse Blues" can't even hold a candle to a very stripped down demo.		Whatever relationship/issues Nicks has Buckingham on how he handles her music, in the long-run her artistry is better for it. '24 Karat Gold' won't be going into any kind of rotation for me. It had potential, but it seems to be squandered.
1,Truly stupid.
1,I've been following Chris since his first album with Passion (1997 or so). I have loved him since then and have seen him live a number of times - about once a year since then! But dare I say that I don't like this album by Chris? I ran out to buy it at Target on its release date but just couldn't love it. It's too much "more of the same." It seems like Ed Cash insists on keeping all Chris's songs structured the same - an 8 measure intro, an 8 measure verse, an  8 measure chorus, a 4 measure verse or the first half of the first verse, the chorus, a bridge, repeat chorus, end. The drums, bass and guitars are dull and unimaginative as well.		I LOVED "Awake My Soul" with Lecrae and that's the only song that made my iPod from the album. Download this song. It's one of the only songs worth owning.		"Whom Shall I Fear" is just boring. Four on the floor throughout it, boring music. Yawn.		"Lay Me Down" is lyrically weak, some phrases making no sense. "Hand on my heart, this much is true, there's no life apart from you" is a perfect example of that. It's another 4 on the floor song that sounds like a knock off of the sound on Mumford and Sons song "I Will Wait." You can lay this song's lyrics right over that song's music.		"God's Great Dance Floor" is an OK song. I do like the mariachi trumpet but the 4 on the floor beat gets monotonous. I also don't like the build going into the bridge. It sounds messy and chaotic.		"White Flag" is a down tempo anthem type song. While I like most of the lyrics, the music is suspiciously similar to Jesus Messiah from his 2008 album. Another 4 on the floor song with a snare cadence.		"Crown Him" is likable. Chris enjoys taking hymns and adding a new chorus or bridge. It breathes fresh life into an old song. This is a good one to download too.		"Jesus Son of God" is another 4 on the floor slow ballad type of song.		"Sovereign" is the only song I love on the album besides "Awake."		"Countless Wonders" recycles phrases and lyrics from earlier songs on his first albums.		"Thank you for saving me" is yet another 4 on the floor song with cliche's throughout.		Basically if you like every song where the kick drum is playing on every beat (called 4 on the floor), then this is your album. Personally when all 12 songs are like that, I get bored with it. It pains me to say this is Tomlin's weakest album but it is.
1,This band must have grown up on New York Dolls, or Buster Poindexter music. Nothing really new here, but then, what is?
1,okay if you're a teen
1,I heard it on Pandora and thought that I'd like it if I heard it more.....wrong....sounds like most of her up tempo songs with very little in the way of depth or verve...
1,Good, "old" song!  Brings back good memories!
1,I should have listened to the onlive version.  It is not the version I wanted.  I do not like the disco/house music version I inadvertently downloaded.

1,This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!
1,If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums, was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one, and make it work. When I heard the first few works by this band, I had thought they were the most unique band since "Hypocrisy". Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own "Bells and Whistles" to stand out from the rest. So on to "Stabbing the Drama" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of "Stabbing the Drama" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic. I also found myself not liking one single track. Not a ONE! Change can be good, but here, change isn't good. Sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone.
1,It is honestly absolutely so sad whenever someone who is young and talented gets so overflowed, they become more like a product than a real singer and entertainer. Sadly, that honestly is the case with Beyonce' Knowles, and her music right now. She has became so overexposed, she feels more like she is a product than a real human being and talented singer. She has let her talent absolutely go to waste in her music right now. When she had came out with a surprise record last year, it might have became as a sales buying spree, but honestly the songs she has came out with for the Beyonce' record, feel more like they are absolute trash, than strong of a singer suppose to be of her calibre. 7/11 from the Platinum Edition of the Beyonce' album is absolutely terri blue, and not even worth the voice singing. She had made a song that is absolutely so poor, it is really her worst dance song. Even Get Me Bodied and Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It) seems more like blessings than garbage after hearing this song. She is absolutely not worth listening to anymore, and if she keeps making bad songs like this, I would say it should be time for Ms. Knowles to retire from being  real singer, and end her career. Because she is unlucky in her own voice and songs to make it enjoyable.		Song: D-

1,It's a great song sung by one of my favorite country gentleman singers.	Reminds me of all my good memories.
1,This is nothing but a yelling contest.  With the exception of maybe one  or two selections, everything else sucks.  He doesn't sound like he's worked on anything, doesn't sound like he's actually singing for a musical; he just gathered some sheet music from musicals and caterwauled his way through it.  There is almost nothing of substance on this album... he's picked "Over the Rainbow"...big deal.  Third graders do that one.  He also chose "Pure Imagination" with absolutely no thought that his voice is not right for that song.  "Pure Imagination" is a gentle, warm song, not fit for the yelling and hollering that Groban seems to think Broadway songs are to be performed.  It's like he thinks every selection is "Anthem".  It's not.	You know, we get it.  He can sing.  He has a strong voice.  We don't need another album of vocal exercises to prove it.  He chose almost all of the wrong selections for the kind of power his voice has.  All in all, very disappointing both in Groban's attitude towards this album, his lack of thought towards the pieces he chose and his arrogance towards noise ordinances.  Save your money.  This one will be on Cheap Album of the Day soon.
1,after i got it i really didn't like it . the preview didn't play enough of the song to make a good decition
1,When it comes down to new artists, they either have it, or they just don't. For newcomer Lady Gaga, who made a breakthrough with Just Dance, she doesn't seem to hit that nail on the head with her latest effort. Poker Face, the second single from her debut record, feels like it has a mismatch within the beats. It really isn't a song that doesn't feel as catchy, or something that just drives like it did before. I just wasn't impressed with the song at all. It didn't feel like you could easily get up and dance to it, and just makes your mind think like it should've dealt out a royal flush, than a pair of deuces. I hope for Lady Gaga, she can deliver better the next time around.		Song: D
1,Well I love this song, and it was my husband's and my song "OUR SONG" but this particular version is UBER long.  It has all that extra on and on forever ending that feels like it will NEVER end.  The radio version cuts all of that out.  Get the radio edit version.
1,Never heard of Nicki Minaj until I heard this song.	Getting overplayed and become an opening act for britney spears femme fatale tour.	You won't get pass the first 30 seconds of the song. Completely Unlistenable
1,I think I'm giving up on Lucinda Williams.		With her first, I dunno, six albums, she pretty much hit it out of the park. With her next 2-3, she was ok and the disks grew on me. But with 2008's 'Little Honey' it kind of all went south for me. She somewhat - kind of - redeemed herself with her 2014 release, but a Williams album, to me, should be more than just halfway passable.		I have zero qualms with the musicianship on 'the Ghosts of Highway 20'.  The musicians are great. For g-d's sake, she has Bill Frisell and Greg Leisz on guitars. Not too shabby.		The songwriting seems ok. Not Williams-stellar, but certainly not bad either.		But like the last few disks, it's Lucinda's voice, or lack thereof, that drags the songs down. The gravel, or singing with a mouthful of broken marbles makes Marianne Faithful (circa 1979) sound like sweetest voiced angel ever.		And it's not that Williams should have the perfect voice - that's not her style, it never was - but if you compare, not even her early work, but the could have been / should have been great 'West' and the iffy 'Blessed' in comparison she could give diction lessons then.		Perhaps she has a vocal cord issue. If so, she should get a vocal coach and do some exercises. If she's purposefully trying to sound like this, then the end-result is lost on me.		I get her "true fans" would rip me apart for a review like this. But I own every disk she's ever released. Just because you like an artist doesn't mean they get a free pass for putting out subpar albums.		The bigger question is if I will just buy her next disk blindly.
1,Ok...
1,Don't even remember this purchase
1,This song is very aggressive and not easy on my ears.  I absolutely adore Jennifer Lopez, but when I was buying this song, I did not get to hear preview - my bad.  There is another super-wonderful song on this album "Di me porque lloras... De felicidad" - I wish I purchased that one, instead.  That other song is brilliant, sensual and touching.  I love Jennifer Lopez.  I am very much like her, just not Puerto Rican :)
1,I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort...I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted...I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers...but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.  Brandon you should recall this album and act as if it never happened.  I hope the next Killers album sounds NOTHING like this or I will be disappointed.
1,I expected this to be the studio version.  It wasn't listed as a Live version, just listed by name and it was the only one that was actually Metallica doing it.  Unlike with digital books, you can cancel it as Ordered by Mistake.  I had to go to iTunes to get the studio version....not happy!
1,When it has came down to Beyonce, and the music she had from her lackluster 4th album, 4, she just doesn't have the voice and the connection with her songs to really match what she did have from her earlier career. That showed in a lot of songs from that album. Dance For You, which became the 5th single from that album just doesn't have the ignition she had brought out to her fans like Single Ladies had shown. I really didn't enjoy the song at all. Not only does she not deliver in the conviction with her song, she really feels like she tries to bring the sexy out, but it feels more like a lagged effort with the song. If you are new to Beyonce' Knowles music, find another song to dance to, because this dance a lagged tune.		Song: D+
1,I honestly can't stand this song - I just bought it for my dad.  The singing is fine,  I just recall the era when it was over saturated on the radio. *sigh*
1,The beauty in this song is unmatched Katy Perry shows why she is a #1 hit making machine with gorgeous powerful vocals that make you feel something every time she opens her mouth and unleashes a rainbow of beautiful unmatched vocals. This is easily the best song of 2010 and quite possibly the best song of the decade!
1,Honestly, I am very upset at how very poor many girl groups have came together and lagged on the chemistry their voices have shown at the soul overall. It is just too sad that they haven't shown enough chemistry in regards to a song being more everlasting at the soul, and just sounds more like a fad eventually going away. That has honestly happened so often with a lot of girl groups from the Pussycat Dolls and others losing their career focus, and will only have maybe at least one song to stand the test of time alone. Unfortunately for Fifth Harmony, they have been really lagging in regards to better songs, and not showing individual harmonies and chemistry at the soul. They did barely show it with Write On Me from their 7/27 album. Work From Home though isn't actually a driven song that ignites from the heart, and the song just drags down overall. I didn't like the song at the very end, and the gals definitely haven't really been able to learn from their first set of songs like Worth It & Sledgehammer. Hopefully, there will be much better from them down the road.		Song: D+
1,Bought for a friend but I didn't care for it. He loved it.
1,music is sooooo lazy these days, catchy for a time or two then turns to mush
1,no music is better than some of the music you hear nowadays. music just sucks in general and doesnt work for me.
1,ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.
1,I have purchased many of these $0.99 sets. These sets make great background music to play while working on my office computer. This set has problems. Essentially, the recording is very poor. I have compared these with  a full EMI set I own, track by track on my home system. I feel that the source material for these MP3's must be very old. There are much better sources for this music out there for a low price. The tone and dynamics of these recordings make them unlistenable.
1,First roar & now this stinking up the airwaves & its hitting up the charts? Will she ever go away?	nice going people , You don't know what good music is anymore.
1,NOt your problem, maybe my computer is to old.  Use to be able to download, but no more.  Thanks to your customer service for all the help.
1,There is honestly no doubt about the fact that there are very few artists that feel like they can hit the right nail on the head. But for Kelly Clarkson, she honestly hasn't been able to make music sound all her own so well. That actually is proof of her latest single, Already Gone, the 3rd single from her latest album All I Ever Wanted isn't really a song that feels like it is original. Actually, if you honestly get a closer listen to the song, it actually sounds a bit too similar in its melody like Beyonce's recent song Halo. I really am not that fully impressed with Kelly's latest, not only that, but it also is a bit dissapointing. It doesn't bring out the heart on other recent songs, like Whitney Houston's elequent I Look To You. I really definitely think Kelly Clarkson should try and find better songs to make her own, than feeling like she is copying someone else.		Song: D 1/2-
1,Politics and music:  give me a break.
1,The remix version is creepy to me... would not recommend it.  I actually deleted it from my Android and asked for a refund.  It's just creepy... like a scary movie..  I don't like all the hoopla.
1,THIS IS A OK SONG IT WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL  THE ALBUM MIGHT BE OK I DONT LIKE ADELE
1,ok
1,If it is the clean version. It should not have curse words.  I wanted to like the clean version but it is not clean.  What is the point.  Money gone down the drain.  I stand by my 1 star because It should have used alternative words like chic instead of &!*CH!!!  No I can not listen to it when I have my kids in the car or even when I am driving with my Windows down.  It is embarrassing.
1,Didn't like
1,Yeah, I'm a Dixie Chicks fan, and they've been kind of dormant for a few years now, so I was a bit excited regarding two-thirds of the group putting out a "side project", the Court Yard Hounds with their self-titled disk.d		Side project is in quotes because only part of me believes the Chicks will record again and that this is really the new full-tine gig of sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire.		While talented in their own right - both sisters are very accomplished multi-instrumentalists and songwriters - they do lack a certain spark that Natalie Maines brought to the trio as their vocalist.  And overall, I'm being nice.		CYH is kind of snooze of an album.  It has all the right intentions and a lot of talent, but like I said, no spark.		With all due respect to the sisters, they were wise to hire a lead singer of Maines' capabilities.  There is a reason the sisters sing harmony and backing vocals.  While fully capable singers, there is nothing distinctive about what they do here.  There are hundreds of female vocalists already out there who sing with mediocrity ("April's Love", "Skyline", "Fear of Wasted Time", "Well Behaved", etc).  Too add insult to injury, they pick the least charismatic collaborator when having Jakob Dylan duet on one song.  He doesn't even compliment the lead vocal.		There are a few songs that have the right idea, but aren't quite there - like "Delight (Something New Under the Sun)", that you can't think if Maines were taking the lead vocals, it would work.		And then there are ones that are a slight notch above that where they make an attempt for something above a pulse, or a chart position: "The Coast", "I Miss You".		I do like "Ain't No Son". The CHY finally kick it up, but you can't help but wonder how out of the park it could/would have been with Maines singing this.  Still, had more of the disk been like this song, it would have been a worthy purchase.		I wasn't expecting a Dixie Chicks disk, but I was expecting something more creative and not so bland.
1,It is so sad whenever we have a artist become so overexposed, that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside. The tragic truth about Beyonce' Knowles is that she is a product, not even a singer. Her albums have been so poor, that she does not impress me anymore. Now, with the oversaturation she had endured with making Lemonade, many people wonder if it was worth it, and tragically it is not worth it at all. The album in itself has been her lowest performing in not just sales, but airplay as well, since the failure of 4. Beyonce's latest single is more of heartbreak in regards to her marriage with Jay-Z, and also the failure of her mom, Tina's marriage ending in divorce, after Matthew Knowles cheated on Tina, and fathered a child out of wedlock. Hold Up, the third single from Lemonade, is the exact same and so-called heartfelt feeling of being taken for granted at the affair of the heart. But tragically, Beyonce Knowles fails to impress at the soul of the song. She really felt more spooked at the essence in her voice, but overall it really does not work at every note. If you're new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back to Crazy In Love, and trust me it feels better than the wasted heart of Hold Up.		Song: D 1/2-
1,Solid song at first, but it gets old after about two weeks.  I'm sure she will come out with a new song by then to replace this one.
1,I don't understand why Bruno took a very nice song and used profanity in the first 10 seconds.
1,Overprocessed pap garbage, like so much of what is released as an excuse for "music" these days.		Back to Joe Bonamassa, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and other TALENTED artists!
1,song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead.
1,Did not finish this book. I tried to like it, but that was not in the cards for me. Oh well, maybe I will try this again another time.
1,uninstalled this one...I thought this was my comments  but this thing requires a certain amount of words (20) to give feedback. Stupid!!! what do you think?
1,i don't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of Dolly Parton's song. She oversang and it's just kind of an annoying song to sit through...what a drag...
1,It is absolutely sad that whenever someone who is young and talented takes on a different route in their work, where their career goes down to tubes. That is a very risky move at the start, and easily someone's career can easily be lost or found again. It surprisingly worked for Ed Sheeran but honestly it hasn't worked for Meghan Trainor whom just came out a few years back. She did make a good starting namesake for herself  with catchy songs like Dear Future Husband and All About That Bass. But with the success of her first album, trying to change your work isn't always as good as the first record. When I had first heard No from her second album Thank You, I was honestly not impressed with the song, and thought it was a absolute departure that really showed her voice expanding was a blow to her heart. I really found No to not deliver. While it might be stepping into Beyonce' and Rihanna territory, it really doesn't work for Meghan. Maybe when her second album Thank You comes out, there will be much better songs for her in the second album slump.		Song: D-
1,this is not a good song thought id like it but it is not would not recamend it to anyone
1,this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.
1,God Imagine Dragons are a one hit wonder that have not gone away.
1,Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
1,This album is auditory castration		Coheed is typically very badass and amazing and hard hitting, but this album is the total opposite. This is like little baby girl music.		It has no teeth, no punch, no fight in it. Its like the soundtrack they would give your dog to take home after they just neutered him. This is like the perfect album to put on when visiting your 70 year old grandma, so you two can sit and listen together as she knits you a sweater and bakes cookies. And then you can crank the volume when you go out back and prance around in the flower garden.		If you like awesome music that you can respect than this album is not for you. Just go listen to all their other albums, since they are what men listen to.
1,My lovely children can be a bit sneaky. Either that or I just wasn't paying attention when they asked me for it. Probably the latter.
1,quik is one of the best technical sounding Producers and he always kept a groove and of course i dug the old triangle base he came out of with. problem is he is recycling a third tier version of stuff he did better back in the day. bringing back  El Debarge, Rob Funksta Bacon,Suga Free  doesn't lite the fuse as rhythmlism did back in 98.  to  me  he has been  hit and miss for a long time now. you get the occasional decent or party fun cut. humor still is good,though this album feels phoned in. still good to see still putting out albums and he is one of the most underrated figures in Rap Music,however he has done way better.
1,My lovely children can be a bit sneaky. Either that or I just wasn't paying attention when they asked me for it. Probably the latter.
1,music sucks because there is no real value to music. only thing about music is people get brainwashed. no mi
1,Why did it now say anywhere that this version had so much swearing? I can't use this. It's foul. Where's the clean version? I wish I could return this version.
1,When Uncle Kracker decided to go solo after a long association with rap/rocker, Kid Rock, you would have expected some of the same edginess that characterized Rock's music.  Instead, "Follow Me" resulted.  This is a piece of soft-rock swill that belongs as a track on one of those laughable "AM Gold" albums that used to be sold in informercials late at night, instead of on the top of the pop/rock charts.		However, this sappy love song no doubt appealed to fans who are suckers for this type of music.  In addition, I think there was another group of fans who were wary of another Kid Rock-style singer and embraced Uncle Kracker when they realized exactly how soft his music was.		Really not a fan of this song and I change the radio whenever it comes on.
1,This is an "elevator" music with a touch of country. I am glad Amazon allows new artists to be heard, but this music is not going onto my playlist
1,Has that garage/grunge band sound.  Just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s I have collected, and forgettable.  Nice cover though.
1,Not the version I wanted, bought,  listened, found the version I wanted then DELETED this.  Money lost. Be sure whether or not this is the one you like.
1,Didn't realize that this was an Elvis Costello project! T Bone did what he could with it! 20 tracks/18 songs of Folk/R&B! Thanx!
1,bad version
1,This is an average song. I basically like most of it except for the chorus (dance the night away... etc...). The beginning is pretty catchy and I like Pitbull's parts.
1,Kind of aggravating after a while.
1,I never ordered this
1,Lil Wayne is a joke. The cover pic of him as a toddler with gang symbols and bling is wrong. Role model he ain't. Crimminal he is.	Lil Wayne better save his money while he is hot. Truth be told, this no-talent thuggette is straight out of the ghetto. If he keeps ___ing , spending and partying hard, he'll end up broke like MC Hammer. Why he even sells says alot about today's sagging generation.
1,Very repetitive sound and lyrics, she has a good voice but then chooses to sing in ways that don't show off her voice. Some of her meanings are pretty positive and agreeable, but some of them move past self worth and into narcissism.
1,Mediocre
1,Downloaded this song by accident its cute but I don't love it
1,Worst song ever!!!
1,This song is so annoying. At first I liked it but it was so over-played and just has become annoying and over-rated, just like the artist who sings it.
1,Nice song
1,Has that garage/grunge band sound.  Just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s I have collected, and forgettable.  Nice cover though.
1,Not rock
1,Yeah, there's some crying and whining noises, so I had to edit them out so that I could use the song. But overall, it worked for what I needed it for, and the song is nice.
1,Go get Autumn effect, simple as that. I seriously don't even know what I am listening to with this turd.
1,I wanted the radio edit and didn't get it.
1,Anything I would rate 1-2 stars gets deleted. The vocals just do not appeal to me and the music is a bit below average for my taste.
1,Very disappointed!
1,kid  rock  is a  frustrating  act  because  just solely on  the  music  front,  he  covers a  few  styles,  problem  is on an  album like  this  he forgot the  songs  and  settles  for  cliches  of  what worked  more effective  years  ago.  in  truth  musically  he  should  be  more of  a alternative  act,  than  a parity  act  at this stage.  country,pop  and  hip  hop  are all part of his  hybrid  however  nothing  here  ever  touches  on  what  got him over  for  covering  bases  as a artist. this album is just kinda  there with very little hit  and  alot of miss  from  the songs.
1,While the 60's produced some very good music, and while artists like Dan Auerbach like to capture the sprit of the time, most often they miss.  Dan Auerbach of Black Keys fame, put together this new band The Arcs with a bend towards 60's psychedelic rock.  Now despite all of the glowing reviews that all of the major music magazines have been giving this album, I have to tell you it's really not that good.  And I'm not the only one, several people that I trust have heard this disk and all have been less than impressed.  Skip this one.
1,It's okay.
1,This  SUCKS !! - Can't seem to download this to my cloud player terribly disapointed. Will not try again :(
1,I like His Guitar Playing&His Versatility.but the songs themselves are pretty much there&Vocally He reminds me of Brian Mcknight,Babyface,etc.. with the Acoustic Guitar. Been there down that&better in most instances. He is Talented but I don't hear a Knock out song as much as I Hear tight Music.when He gets Words&Music as One then He will escape being labeled in a box with others. He is a Talented Cat though&the Future Looks Promising but a Song like "Crazy" is cool for now but with Artistic Growth he pass that by Leaps&Bounds over time.
1,the music sucks only got it because it was free
1,Seattle electronica duo Odesza's "Sun Models" is an average song at best.  It has a pretty boring beat that doesn't illicit much of a feeling towards anything.  Madelyn Grant addition to the song is more annoying than complimentary.  The end of the song switch the beat to more cooler sound that would have been better served to featured throughout the song.  It was too little too late to redeem this one.
1,say...u ever defecated in someone's earhole. that is the aural equivalent of listening to the new Rixton album..this corporate crud is bad for your health
1,It's a song, how much can you say about that?
1,When it has came down to Nicki Minaj, she has really came out with some very awful songs that show that she not only does not know how to sing, but drive in good songs either. Pound Te Alarm, the latest single from Nicki's album Roman Reloaded isn't really a driven song. It feels very weak and not exciting. She really doesn't have something that makes her driven in her voice. She really has shown that she doesn't have the talent in her voice. It feels more like what she tried to prove with starships earlier this year, it feels like it was honestly wasted away. Well, it won't happen with her next single either. Maybe she should find a new change of pace for herself. Something else that would make you pound the alarm.		Song: D-
1,I really can't put my finger on it but this album did not have the same feel as his others.  As an artist I love his style, love his nice flowing slow songs but I couldn't find any on this one that grabbed me like his previous albums.  Even his mixtapes had awesome tracks on them that I loved.  I will give the album another listen, then go back to his other classic albums.  I guess you could say I am a little dissapointed cause he had set the bar so high in his previous outings.
1,This was some useless version with a bunch of crap that had nothing to do with the original song. Frankly I was cheated!
1,Way better than Teenage Dream. This album is not just filled with sex with bad overly obvious sexual innuendos that weren't really even innuendos because of they obvious they were. This album even while not perfect is much more consistent maybe a little boring to some as many of the songs are slower paced but it definitely is much more tolerable than most of the tracks off Teenage Dream which was recently voted worst album of the decade by Billboard voters.
1,This is the song from the movie FEAR with Reese Witherspoon in case you were looking it up for that reason.
1,Wow, did she really just reference All About That Bass in this song? How pathetic. It just goes to show the lengths to which she's willing to go to keep milking that fake, body positivity "anthem." There is nothing original about her and this proves it.
1,With none of the arrangements on Fallen Angels being true to the originals, it would be easy to say that this was just Bob Dylan being Bob Dylan, and putting his personal mark on these songs ... though almost to the point where they are unrecognizable.  I have to wonder whats going on with this his second album of covers, and I have my thoughts, having seen and heard this concept done time and time again by other aging artists.		There are some muted jazz arrangements here that should stand with more strength and life, yet Dylan, a huge jazz fan, has chosen to nearly hide what he appreciates most.  That Old Black Magic has been turned into a rockabilly shuffle, It Had To Be You barely holds together, as he seems to be nearly reading these songs rather than singing them.  In all honesty, this album sounds like another dreamy look back at his own youth [in much the same manner as Sinatra did] trying to figure out where he fits in during this, the first half of the 21st century, or if it even matters that he does.		Call this gathering of songs whimsical if you will, but please, do not call them great or inspirational, as they come off rather lightweight, shadows of shadows, delivered by a man who may or may not be in the moment as these tracks were recorded.  In a strange way though, the songs all do hang together, but mostly in a manner where Dylan is trying to prove that these vintage ballads are still valid, and thus, if they are, then so is Dylan.		Of course there are those who are gonna tell you that its all brilliant, but its not, and its a real shame that for all his greatness, Bob Dylan cant take his time and present his vision of his later life, or the worlds hes lived through, rather than stepping back into some long lost comfort zone where he no longer needs to gaze out of his window.		But ... you may find it all touching and romantic, so by all means celebrate with Mr. Dylan, for his times, they certainly have changed.		Review by Jenell Kesler
1,I don't know where all these songs went...	There gone.
1,I am thoroughly disappointed with this album. Lady Antebellum seem energetic on TV but half the songs featured here are sooooo boring; they lack real energy and fervor and are too soppy for my liking. The best song on here is the gorgeous and uptempo "Run to You", which ironically is a bonus track! What a disappointment!
1,This "song file" is just a single tone for tuning an instrument. DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you are needing to tune up your instrument.
1,Let me start by saying, I love Linkin Park. I have all their albums and I've seen them live five times. So I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am in The Hunting Party. Even their last two albums (which weren't nearly as good as the ones previous) had some great highlights that made them worth the money. This album sounds like Mike and Chester are singing with a completely different band. Nine out of the 12 songs are heavy metal or speed metal which is weird and out-of-place. Their lyrics, which are usually clever and smart, have been reduced to Chester screaming, "you don't know what you got till it's gone" cliches. "The Last Masquerade" is another sound-a-like Transformers-style song. The only highlight is the first track "Keys to the Kingdom," and it's barely a highlight at that. If you're a LP fan, I recommend listening to the album in it's entirety before you decide to buy.
1,garbage
1,Kind of sound like R.E.M. wannabes, in a bar-band sort of way.
1,I do not like this singer
1,My kid love this song
1,Thought i bought the clean version.
1,this song its the best worst song and the cars where better it had a better way of showing the 1960s off though
1,Miley Cyrus' train-wreck status, and atrocious other music, makes it hard embrace what, on its own merits, could be a solid song.  People may be critical of me not focusing only on the song but, in certain circumstances, you have to consider the bigger picture.  When Avril Lavigne released "When You're Gone", it was a relatively emotional, heartfelt song.  However, it came so soon after her bratty, and obnoxious, song "Girlfriend", that it negatively impacted how I felt towards the latter song.		  Cyrus' run of horrid music ("We Can't Stop", "Party in the USA", and "The Climb"), and her ridiculous "I'm trying to shock you to show you how grown up I am" behavior, detracts from any positive vibe one could get from "Wrecking Ball".  It's possible that, somewhere down the road, Miley will grow out of this phase and focus more on trying to be a quality singer.  Until that time, I cannot view this song positively.
1,It is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone whom has became a product, not a real singer has made more songs that make them just tiresome and more annoying at the soul. Tragically, Rihanna has been one of those singers that really has been more of a product, not from the soul, just overexposed with each and every song she has came out with. Unfortunately, with all the songs that she had came out with, setting up her Anti album, has been poor and lagging at her soul. Her prior single, Work showed again her own voice losing steam, and feeling weak and like is on drugs, during her song. Kiss It Better is also a bleak waste of time. She doesn't deliver a more seductive performance in the heart, and makes the listener feel like they have not been seduced and enchanted from each not sung. It is just a loss at the heart. I definitely think it is time for Rihanna to just retire alone. Perhaps when she walks away, if she walks away, she'll find better on the other side to make it kissed better.		Song: D
1,The beauty in this song is unmatched Katy Perry shows why she is a #1 hit making machine with gorgeous powerful vocals that make you feel something every time she opens her mouth and unleashes a rainbow of beautiful unmatched vocals. This is easily the best song of 2010 and quite possibly the best song of the decade!
1,OK
1,This version is quiet different from the original.  Not as good, in my opinion.  Wish I purchase the original.  I recommend that you pass on this version.
1,Can no longer download songs to my media player. I would not have purchased had I known.  Customer service was not able to help me, but they were very nice.  Have not played the music, any chance I could get a refund?
1,JESUS is indeed the way Maker!!!!
1,heard it on a documentary and thought the chorus was cool but not really worth the listen when it cycles through on the ipod
1,Was in the moment!
1,Good novelty version but not Symphony quality.
1,Love album but sound is terrible can't believe the record company dropped the ball on such a good album
1,ok song
1,never downloaded still waiting months later
1,Too much repetition the whole song will tick you off after a couple times listening. This is the rhythm of the night was echoing in my ears as i dreamed that night.
1,It is honestly and absolutely sad when someone young and talented has thrown their voice away. Unfortunately Rihanna has been one of those singers that has been more of a product, than a real singer. The past few years have shown a lag in better music from her, after the wasted time prepping for her Anti album. The set of songs that she had came out the past few years like B&&&& Better Have My Money and American Oxygen, were overall not included on the final product which became Anti, and for her lead single from Anti, Work with Drake, Rihanna had sounded more like she was high on drugs, than made a solid song because she really felt more tired and choppy in her work. Now for her second single, Kiss It Better, she is trying to be more of a sex symbol in her song, and sadly she doesn't pull it off. I really wasn't impressed at all. After she tried to make a better song, where she sounded weak, and now she is trying to be a sex symbol, and she doesn't pull it off. I think Rihanna needs to find much better in her work, and take a long break from singing, to find herself all over, because she hasn't yet kissed it better.		Song: D
1,Purchased this without knowing it would be taken directly from the movie. It is a beautiful song but the background vocals, the firing of the MK-47's and M16's and jumps off into a whole different song. The history of this moving melody is as interesting as the song itself. Unfortunately, trying to find an unadulterated version of it may be just about impossible to come by. I'm debating about the "In The Style of" album, which may contain it, but can't confirm it. The writer and musical group (Clann An Drumma) don't have it for sale. Truly moving score, but am reluctant to end up buying the same edit.
1,It was ok
1,This song is horrible. I like Adele, bought her last album, but this song is so repetitive and sounds like every other song she's made in the past except just the choruses of those songs repeated back to back leading to a song that's filled with nothing but screeching nonstop trying to sound talented but instead coming off as very conceited. Trying to show off your vocal range just screaming is not talent.
1,meh
1,This song purchase was a real disapointment. Don't think I would purchase any other songs by this artist. Would not recommend.
1,Rehashing and regurgitating that is. He did it decades ago with Dire Straits then carried on through his solo works. From songs about people travelling to make their way (Telegraph Road, Privateering), to tough characters who brag about their lives (Money For Nothing, Heavy Fuel, Hot or What). And some poor folk who are down and out - these artists are stuck in a groove with their working class poor tales. Then he throws in some dull as hell bluesy songs which does nothing for his music or the genre. He alternates with sad songs using mandolin - a good way to trick people into thinking you've written a good song these days. His conversational songs now grate on me, as uninspired as the rest. Go take a nap, Knopf.
1,Seriously? What is this crap? People who seriously consider this music need to have their brain examined for poop smears on their medulla oblongata.
1,How many times do you have to listen to the Star-Spangled Banner to listen to this more than twice, again? Wish I'd just listened to it once and not bought it.
1,Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
1,I didn't screen the lyrics carefully enough before I bought it.  I like the reggae rhythm and the instrumentation is fairly good.  Wyclef Jean's vocals are good; Shakira's are a little week.  The lyrics are sexually suggestive, so I have to be careful not to play this song for younger audiences.
1,This is a joke. There's no way people are buying this junk.	If they continue to do so shame on you.
1,As an avid PF fan up to and including The Wall, this is garbage. Gilmour has a good voice and is a guitar virtuoso, but this should not have the PF name on it. Same goes for Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell. And for anyone comparing it to pre Dark Side of the Moon PF, you are absolutely clueless. This is not PF. Its Mason and Gilmour doing a cash grab and soiling the PF name more than they already have. I say good riddance to those two. And anyone who says they saw PF during the Momentary Lapse and Division Bell tours, you did not. Just like those who went to see McCartney did not see the Beatles.
1,Nothing in the description said it was a remake.  The original was a classic, but this variant is completely forgettable.
1,It wasn't that good
1,PRODUCTION: 4/8	LYRICS: 4/8	CONTENT: 4/8	ENJOYMENT: 4/8		O.N.I.F.C. is a boring album with a repetitive sound and irrelevant content, Wiz Khalifa does nothing to heighten the enjoyment as his flow and delivery is lazy and uninteresting.  The production consists of a laid back and chill vibe with a slow bpm.  The sound is very cohesive and it transitions well but the tracks come off repetitive and not attention grabbing; only the Neptune's track catches the ear.  Wiz Khalifa delivers a decent but rather lazy performance, literally talking about that same ol' jazz: marijuana, money, lavish living.  There is a little bit of meaning but that is essentially muffled by the excessive irrelevance.  Boring and uninteresting.
1,People are TRYING to make 50 Cents to be the next 2Pac or Biggie. But in my opinion, he can only be compared to JaRule. People are in love with the fact that he has been shot # of times, but if people really pay attention to the music....they will realize that his music is nothing to crow about. There are only 4 songs that sound decent and they are:	 PIMP	 Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem)	 In Da Club	 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg)	That's it. But its not enough to make you buy the entire cd. As I stated before, got change?
1,I gave a rating of 2 stars because the live version from the show, sounded awesome to me, but the studio recording really didn't to me.
1,Do yourself a favor and download Jeff Beck's version instead. It is an amazing song but this version is brutal.
1,This is not music , its a cry for help.	Oh my gosh this is awful. not worth 1 star.
1,I didn't want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase.
1,This is the epitome of what's wrong with film music today: it's bland, boring, forgettable and, while it fits the film is an utter bore to listen to isolated from the film. The Terminator Genisys score sounds a great deal like Lorne Balfe listened to the original scores, namely Brad Fidel's, jotted down a couple notes, included some very weak reference and then filled up the rest of the score with a Hans Zimmer-style soundtrack of synth noise. With tracks like "Sarah and Kyle" it sounds like its trying hard to find a theme or a melody but completely failing. I can leave a film scored by John Williams and remember themes and melodies clearly, but with this soundtrack, there's, well, there's that song that went "dah-duh...." then had some noises and booming chords and drums and, was there a theme in there somewhere?
1,ok
1,what the heck is stalley talking about?  robbing people for chevys and selling dope? what happened to all the introspective lyrics from " tell montez I love her" or " monkey ish" classic and honest songs from intelligent trunk music. when I first got introduced to stalleys music it seem like it was gonna be something unique or different but what it sounds like now is a failed attempt at being a trapper...
1,got this for .99 cents. about right for the quality of the music. album gets old fast. it was worth a chance for .99 cents, would not pay full price
1,Ok
1,First of all lets correct the misinformation here Keith was not a one hit wonder after 98.6 he came back even stronger with Ain't Gonna Lie which went higher on the charts,second K-tel in the 70,s was a wonderful company who presented only original hits and I do mean original but with the advent of cd,s K-tel no longer could get the rights to release the original songs on cd so they went and got the original artists to redo the songs,this is a poor way to try and get more money from the customer by shamming them into believing these are the originals and they put in very very very small print redone by the original artists,get the original hits on Amazon there not that much more and you,ll be three times as pleased. Shame on you K-tel you were once the leadre in compilations by original artists and now this is how far you have fallen..
1,Terrible song! I just needed the clean version for Djing. This is the reason Hip Hop is dead amongst most Black artists!
1,Pauses a LOT during the song, can't really get into the music.  Im going to try and get my money back!
1,I didn't pay attention to the fact that its the long explicit version of "I'll Be Missing You"  I don't like it and haven't listened to it since I bought it.
1,Most of the songs on this debut don't have much melody and sound the same.  Doctor My Eyes is good but the rest are all very boring.  Also, his voice is not very good and he has trouble hitting many of the notes.  Good background music but not a very dynamic debut.
1,MY PARTY IS OVER IT'S 2016 AND I WANT TO PARTY LIKE IT'S 1999
1,the music sucks only got it because it was free
1,there is no reason for me to listen to music at all. it just sucks really bad and a waste of time. t
1,Not the full version.
1,to Amazon:		why is this here? i do not remember ordering this, & I never have had it delivered to my home. I know this to be true because I do not own this cd or any REO Speedwagon music
1,Meh, was hoping for something else...but got this. I think I'll keep this "in the cellar"
1,This song sucks....so does Fergie.  Just another over produced, manufactured, no-talent, annoying auto-tuned, polished turd.  That;s it.
1,I bought the first album with the new singer wasn't that impressed now the second album is just missing something first Krista Garmo left now Jeff Tate is gone and well I guess Queensryche is gone I know this probably isn't popular with all the positive review but I guess the 80s  and the nine days are gone so is Queensryche
1,Some tracks seem like the same as the last one. A lot of Cricket chirping in quite a few songs. Guitar strumming is a little too loud to be considered Lullaby material. I think this would keep a baby awake not help it go to sleep. Not soothing enough in my humble opinion to be considered a cd for kids. Maybe for older adults while there awake but not for trying to fall asleep.
1,Wow, has anybody not noticed that this song sounds exactly like What I've Done, just in a different key? That other 1 star review put it correctly. I can't wait to see the new Transformers film, but I don't imagine this making a good theme song. Seriously, Michael Bay needs to stop kissing Linkin Park's arse. This song is very boring and sounds like everything on Minutes to Midnight, and it amazes me that people miss the fact that LP love to put out the same single every year and re-write the lyrics.
1,now the  dream got  a ok pen game for others, however on his own, he just ain't got alot going for him.  as is the case with his previous other albums  R.Kelly, Michael  Jackson and Prince are his blueprint for the music he makes and he stays stuck in tribute mode as to enhancing or adding the best of what those  artists had to offer. production on his albums save him, because vocally to me he sounds like a  constipated version of Kermit the  frog. i just don't care for this cat's voice, and now  the lyrics here were  wack.  talk about a one trick pony?  he just phoned this in and said  whatever and threw his hands in the air.  sorry  to tell this turkey  but this ain't no 12 Play and I'm sure he will  try again and again and again.
1,I listen to this cd 2 times.  I can not find one song that I like.  This guy can not sing and the music is bad.  I could have wrote better songs.
1,This is the first and only Rihanna song I have ever purchased.  I'm pretty sure it will be my last.
1,none
1,ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.
1,In the world of guitarists you have many types, people who are virtuosos (Vai, Satriani, Eddie Van Halen) use no book, throw it completely out the window and play even by ear. You have people with very unique recognizable styles (Eric Clapton, Slash, BB King, Stevie Ray Vaught etc), who aren't "super guitarists" but good in their own right. And strictly by the book guitar players (Tony McAlpine, John Petrucci, Jeff Loomis, Chris Broderick), Berkley school of music by the book perfectionists. Which can become boring quick. The two super "solo" guitarists who started all this without a doubt were Vai and Satch, with Hendrix and Halen paving the path before them. While Satriani has enjoyed huge success through the years and given lessons to countless people, and many great albums, Vai has remained "around" as i would say with some notable and not so notable albums. Vai has the very trippy, unique, 70's Frank Zappa style guitar playing, and out of key, odd chord progressions, along with various effects to boot. This can be very cool, but also very annoying. The best album Vai has/had ever done was definitely Passion And Warfare IMO, and hasn't done much since that you can listen all the way through and say wow that's just a great album to put in from beginning to end. While Satch on the other hand makes albums you can listen to, hum along to, and just listen to again and again. And his song writing ability, and creativity far surpasses Vai.		I think Vai is an excellent, technically proficient guitarist with some wild ideas, and super creativity. But as i said that doesn't always make it an enjoyable listen, as much as a lot of out of key noise. There are some slightly enjoyable tracks including Velorum, The Moon and I, and Chasing the world. And they are much more simplistic than the rest of the album. Other artists who do this type of, what i call over dramatic, quirky crazy playing are "animals as leaders", "Devin Townsend" (mostly his singing and song writing), and even someone like Tony McAlpine with his strange combinations of Jazz and whatever you want to call it. So this is just another album much like the ones he's done over the last 15 years or more. Most songs have no direction for a straight through "calm enjoyable listen". And this music is without a doubt an acquired taste. All these guitar players are good in their own ways but Vai just isn't one that i can tolerate anymore. I like the more straight forward, hum along, tab your foot to guitar playing. And the only band i've really heard do this type of music right and make it great is Mastodon (along with their brilliant song writing skills and singing). Get rid of all the wild sound effects Steve, and just make some good guitar music, we all know you can.
1,thought I liked it but it gets old quickly. oh, this is an old song. Dah. I have it on my oldies list.
1,I have to say like most Chicago fans that I am happy that hey have released a studio album with new material cause it was long overdue, but I have listened critically to this album numerous times and my first impression was right. Now this is not a comparison about old 70's chicago versus current chicago cause that is a matter of taste, but for the format that they were going for this album it did not work smoothly. If you are into the more ballad oriented Chicago, you might want to check this out, but I was dissapointed. There are some beautiful melodies sung with Jason Scheff and the writing material is not bad on this album, but I would have liked to see more imput writing wise from Bill Champlin and Robert Lamm since Scheff had the most input with seven songs.  There was too many ballads in the beginning of the cd.  I felt some more Chicago presence from track 7 and on, but not that much.  I did not like the producer on this album.  Chicago allowed over a dozen other musicians to play keyboards, drums, guitar, vocals etc that I felt cheated. I did not know who played on what track.  My biggest beef with this album is the way it was produced.  It had Pro Tools(digital recording tool)written all over and it was obvious.  I don't care that they are recording digital cause that is the norm, but it was way over the top!  The lead & back vocals(not to mention the brass)went through some kind of pitch correcting machine that is made the whole album plastic in the department of soul deliverance.  The back vocals on the song "Caroline" sounded like a straight keyboard sample.  Why do the these great singers Of Chicago have to go though that pop-machine?  They sounded like those country pop boy bands that have these pristine vocals and it's painfully obvious.  I do not mind effects on the voice but I still want to hear the human essence of a person's voice.  Not some voice pitch corrector that was invented for most millinium pop artists who could not sing to begin with.  These veterans have honed their craft so much that they should be proud to avoid such gadgets.  I do not mind the loops, midi, sequencing, samples etc, cause chicago was always in the forefront of using technology in the days of producer Foster, and not to mention Chicago 18 when the drummer programmed all of his playing into a drum machine, but this album is so overly produced that they would have to counter the next Chicago 31 with some organic sounds to balance for what they allowed.
1,I admired them so much when they debuted.  Courtney Love is the frontwoman.  It's pretty fast for grunge, yet hard.  My favorite parts are when the bass completely stops and she sings.  Ultimately, I think she's really cool.
1,Utube is better sounding and stays with Over The Rainbow.
1,I thought it was the same version as the soundtrack to the movie
1,I am a big Donell Jones fan and was glad to see him back.  However, it seems he is trying something different and mixing some hip hop in.  Don't get me wrong that may work for some but it doesn't mix well on this CD. Donell has had some excellent CDs in the past but this one veers from his soulful sound and ends up sounding contrived.  Hopefully on his next CD he will return to the soul sound that made me love his music.
1,Wow, I don't know anything by FL other than that cool -albeit morbid- track about everyone being dead at some point, but like many others I've listened to a few Beatles records and plenty of Beatles tributes and covers version of their catalogue.  So I do appreciate Flaming Lips putting a unique spin on these oft' heard tracks. Instead of merely copying them, as has been done before. I've enjoyed the wonderful BIG DADDY doo-wop take on this LP and it works on many levels, and everyone from Cheap Trick (recent live) to Dub All Stars reggae groves have taken a run at SPLHCB. Unfortunately this CD doesn't compare to anything I've liked about the Beatles. As each track started in my player, I hoped for the best, but from high pitched and whiny vocals to purposely out of tune guitars and a mish mosh of sounds, none of this worked at all for me. Some tracks had an ok vocal but I missed the drums, some tracks had a ok sound track but the singing ruined what might have been a decent sound-bed. If I were to play a track on a Breakfast with the Beatles style Sunday Morning radio program, to tell the world there was a new Flaming Lips Beatles CD, I'd probably go with "Lovely Rita". It was the best of the lot. This disc of music doesn't benefit anyone.
1,Well after all the buzz, I expected something new, fresh, different and exciting.  But what I experienced was a instant replay of the Motown sound and on the first tune of what sounded like Dancing in the streets for the musical support for the song Rehab.  As I continued to listen, I encountered much of the same sounds and lyrics that emulate the sounds and bite off of the song title "Me & Mrs. Jones, Billy Paul from back in the day.  Later in the CD, I could have sworn I heard the music from 60's Supreme Diva's "Baby Love".  Now wait just one minute, I thought what is this? and before I knew it the CD had ended, just as fast as it began.  Like getting to the creshindo and letting the song drop.  But now as I look at the reviews I think the fasination is the fact that this British, artist is mimicing the Black Motown era experience to some level of their expectations, of course I grimaced.  You see some people just don't get it but if you really want to hear a current artist who has truly created the essence of an old school generation you should listen to Chrisette Michelle, who really bring the best of lessons taught by Ella, Billie, Aretha, and Natalie.  And most importantly she brings her own unique style and music along the way.  I didn't see any mention or credits given to any of those artist that Amy mimics which it a bigger DISGRACE.  To add insult to injury she named this "Back to Black".  Rehab is what your Daddy should advise. Lastly the reference some reviewer made to Erykah Badu,LISTEN UP.... THERE IS NO COMPARISON.  She AIN'T got NO-THING on DAT!
1,So glad there not popular anymore. The song is cheesy and way overrated in the 90's.	Mmmbop shouldn't be a hit , its more like mmmsuck!
1,Well, the single track "F#%@ it" is almost a parody, but more an alternate explicit version of that song by that chick who sang "I don't care/I love it" with the chorus changed up a bit in the words, and done with a hard rocking backing sound that does sound great. Definitely a 5 star song, a personal favorite for the year, and worthy of being apart of the Buck Cherry greatest hits.		However, there is 6 other songs of garbage filler. Calculating that, I come up with a rating of 1.5, so I'll give the LP 2 stars to be generous. But honestly, this is more like a release of a great single with fillers around it, a decent price, one great song, but you might wanna just buy the one song there instead of the LP, unless you're a die hard Buck Cherry fan who must own everything they release.
1,music sucks so bad nowadays because all they do is play stupid songs that have nothing to do with li
1,"Let Her Go" is a typical sappy ballad by a singer comes across as trying to hard to be a 'super sensitive' man trying to woo the ladies' hearts.  There's nothing particularly bad about this song.  It just happens to be too slow, even for the type of song it is, and not very interesting to listen to.
1,I admired them so much when they debuted.  Courtney Love is the frontwoman.  It's pretty fast for grunge, yet hard.  My favorite parts are when the bass completely stops and she sings.  Ultimately, I think she's really cool.
1,Old but I remember it well. Jimmy Dean.	Its More Poem than Song. Good sound and clear as a bell
1,I love the title. However that is about it. It is just generic thrash metal over vocals that sound like a gerbil in a blender.
1,I've always thought that the best of Bon Jovi was Richie Sambora as he show us in his two previous jobs. But on this album I see the worst of the songs of  Bon Jovi's last albums. On the other hand, the sound of this CD is very noisy, like the style of some albums of the 70's . In short, and for not doing more blood, this cd can be summarized as a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs.
1,Not a great song, unfortunately.
1,I was very disappointed with this release.  The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band.  The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.		The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'.  I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie "Wedding Singer". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like.  I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.		Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better.  Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses.  I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.		The Dream really is dead.
1,I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.
1,I don't get it. I just don't get it. I thought music had hit its low with BEP's musical brain aneurysm "Boom Boom Pow". I can autotune myself vomiting and that would be a better song. But then I heard this song.		I looked it up on a lyrics site and was startled at what I read- 12 people wrote this song. Actually I'm amazed. It took 12 people to write lyrics like:		"I've gotta feeling	that tonight's gonna be a good night	that tonight's gonna be a good night	that tonight's gonna be a good, good night"	Which is repeated for roughly 90 seconds before the song even starts. How about:		"Tonight's the night, let's live it up	I got my money, let's spend it up" (yeah, rhyming "Up" and "up")		"Monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday, friday, saturday, saturday to sunday,	Get get get get get with us, you know what we say-say, party every day	pppparty every day" (We know what the days of the week are. Party every day???)		Or what about the fact that "That tonight's gonna be a good night" is repeated 18 times, "Do it" is repeated 31 times, or the random use of "Mazel tov" or "L'chiam" (Is this that movie "When The Wind Blows" on acid? "When the BEP Blows"?)???		Yeah the beat is pretty catchy, you gotta admit. Though it's catchy the first time you hear it, and then the next 500 times you hear it makes you wanna find the nearest object that can be used as a weapon, and find some way	to use it as means of killing yourself. I'd say "Avoid" but since this drivel is played roughly every 10 minutes, it's really unavoidable.		Poor little state of music.
1,Believe it or not, this was my first time purchasing a Trina album. It's not that I haven't liked any of her songs in the past, because I have. I guess she was just never one of my top priority artists. I immediately took notice of her, though, with her 2000 (or maybe 1999) debut single, "Da Baddest Chick." I actually liked the song initially--although it sounds a bit dated today--and the video, which showed her smashing all kinds of things with a baseball bat, was pretty amusing, too. The next single was the summer-anthem, "Pull Over," which had my head bobbing for quite awhile. I pretty much enjoyed most of her singles, including "Told Y'All," the song she did with Tweet and Missy Elliott, and of course "Single Again." I've thought about buying her past three albums when each came out, but I became uneasy about them after listening to samples. They just didn't affect me the way her singles did and the production sounded a bit sub-par. However, the samples for this album sounded much better, and with her initial success with this album--debuting at her highest Billboard chart position ever--I decided to finally give one of Trina's album a try.		The album opens with a terribly stupid and useless intro, which is just here to take up an extra minute. The smarter choice would've been to just begin the album with the first full-length track, "Still Da Baddest." The superb production is upbeat and dramatically triumphant, a perfect canvas for Trina's confident and boastful lines about her survival and success in the music business. (Believe it or not, this female emcee has been in the rap game for one or two years shy of a decade). The first single, "Single Again," is also one of the best tracks from this set; it has a catchy chorus and is a bonafide ladies' anthem. I really can't understand why the song wasn't very successful. "Look Back At Me" should definitely be a future single, with its simplistic, dirty South production mixed with chopped and screwed vocals. "I Got A Bottle," which features a guest appearance from Missy Elliott, is a fun and playful club song. On "Clear It Out," Trina gives us a piece of her mind, stating how she is fed up with haters, critics, and aspiring female rappers who think the life is easy. And "Hot Commodity" is a great closing track; it's just as upbeat and proud as the opening song. Unfortunately, those were the only tracks that I was really pleased with. The rest are pretty unexciting. "I Got A Thang For You" and "Wish I Never Met You" both desparately try to replicate her most successful single to date, "Here We Go Again." (Which I didn't think was that great in the first place). The production isn't great, and Trina's rhymes are way too laid-back and lazy. "Killing You..." is bland and very repetitve and "Phone" is simply here for shock value, nothing more. Last, "Stop Traffic" suffers from subpar production and a really lame hook. (Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know green means "go" and red means "stop." That's not clever!)		The bottom line: So... I've finally bought a Trina album. While it's a bit better than I was expectting, Still Da Baddest is far from flawless. It has several excellent tracks that I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is no medium on here. It's either really good, or really bad, and there are just as many bad songs as there are good. Most of the time Trina's rhymes are okay and even sometimes great (except for the somewhat pitiful deliveries on the two ballads). What really causes this album to suffer is the lack of quality in production, hooks, or song ideas. If you're a Trina fan, buy it. If not, I wouldn't really recommend it. Sure there are some good tracks here, but they are barely worth it for me.		Key tracks: Single Again, Look Back At Me, Still Da Baddest, Hot Commodity.
1,I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.
1,i did not buy this so not sure why i'm asked to rate it.. Can someone explain why i have to rate it as a purchase I made?
1,Downoaded for a friend... not my cup-o-tea
1,poor mis-guided jewel...she had it all. the looks, the voice, the songs, and the money.  i guess she decided she had enough when she put together this crap all album.  the only good song on it is "Run to You"  and a couple others but VERY few.  this cd might be good if she stuck with her original sound. if u wanna check out the real Jewel check out Pieces of You, Spirit, or This Way.  they're better than this cd in sooooo many ways.  but this cd DOES have potential.  if she kept away from the techno and dance sh** than this woulda  been a really good cd probly.  she's still got the writing ability.  but anyways.  hopefully this phase of hers won't last too long.
1,Wow--22 five-star reviews so far, and one four-star.  The Train fans are out in full force, and quite early.  I'm really glad that I was able to stream this album first, because otherwise I would have felt completely ripped off.  All in all, while this isn't the worst Christmas album I've ever heard, it's certainly not all that good.  The vocals are all over the place--by the third song, I was hoping for a new vocalist to take over.  They seem to have been done rather quickly, with few if any retakes, and to be honest, I don't feel that the lead vocalist has the vocal qualities to maintain interest for more than ten or fifteen minutes, much less an entire album.  The music behind him is competent, of course, but nothing at all special--it, too, sounds like it was done rather quickly.  Christmas albums are often like that--groups don't spend nearly as much time rehearsing or recording them.  The bottom line is that for every standard on here, I have four of five versions that are much better than these.  For the new songs, there was nothing that made me take notice, nothing that I felt I really wanted to hear again.  It's a standard pop album, with somewhat Christmasy lyrics, and nothing special that I'll look forward to keeping.
1,em's getting way too soft doing songs wirth crazy rihanna but hey could be worser.
1,I loved "Intuition" when I heard it, and I'm not a big Jewel fan!  So, I was hoping for a welcome change from her normal folk music when I downloaded this.  Hate to say this, but this isn't really pop.  It's mostly folk with a rock edge.  Think Michelle Branch here with some Natalie Merchant and modern Madonna influences.  Really, "Intuition" is as pop as it gets and to me, it's really the only good song on this album!
1,The feeling of what Lady Gaga has made into music being all her own, well there is no question that she is not someone whom is delivering her own music. She has shown to take too much from other artists and copy their style. That is the case with her latest single Born My Way. The song takes on too much of the feeling of Madonna's Express Yourself, with a pinch of Vogue. I really wasn't even impressed with the song at all. It really feels like she is trying too hard to be into the sexual appeal Madonna had shown for over 25 years, than being herself. I really think she needs to come up with something better for her music when her sophmore album comes up soon. If it sounds too much like what Born This Way had shown, than I will definitely say no to the record.		Song: D+
1,Starts off great, gets bad real quick.	Some of the biggest names in R&B (or urban music if you read the insert) right now are on it, with some strong newcomers.  The Erykah Badu song is a powerful ballad of laziness and better than almost everything on her "Mama's Gun" record.  Rookie Glen Lewis gives us the strongest song on the CD, "Don't You Forget It", which is the track they're using in the TV commercials.  When his record finally drops (11/2001) I'll get it on the strength of tis track.	The only other standout tracks belong to India. Arie, who gives us a great track in the tone of the stuff on her album, but smoothed around the edges, "Butterfly"; and Jill Scott, who's offering is, sadly, a remix of a song we've already been inundated with over the past year, so it already sounds old once the laser hits the disc.  Jill can do no wrong with me, but this was a mistake.  It's a cool track, but we could do with something new about now.  Fortunately, she's dropping a double album this month as well to make up for it, so I'll be content soon enough.	The rest of the album is abhorrent.  Macy Gray (whom I never liked anyway) is even worse here.  I'd rather hear her sing the National Anthem again.  The new cats on the rest of the disc don't lift off, and even vets like the indestructable Amel Larrieux and the Roots don't keep up the groove of the record.  After about the 5th track, you're in for some rough riding, buddy.	The tracks by Glen Lewis, Badu and Arie are almost wort the disc, though.  Almost, except that lewis's track will likely be on his CD anyway, and Arie will probably put this track on her next record as well, so you'll end up with the best stuff one way or another.
1,A lot of money and next to impossible to install well.
1,Bought wrong song
1,What happened??
1,Love the old traditional Christmas carols!  This one wasn't as good as I was hoping for.  I do enjoy the band, but thought they could have done better.
1,ITS BS Amazon forces you to download their software medial player in order to download the music you paid for. I don't want their media player. I will never buy music from Amazon again.
1,There are so few artists that seem to honestly that really stopped making songs that really came from the heart. Sadly, Beyonce' Knowles has really been more of a product than a strong songstress, and sadly the quality of her has withered slowly to death where she has been more tiring than exciting, and sadly that has shown in her songs. 7/11, the lead single from Beyonce' Knowles, Beyonce' (Platinum Edition,) is actually a wasted dance song that definitely has shown she has honestly lost all of her voice. The song definitely is a wasted dance song that shows that she has lost her spirit. The song is honestly one of her worst songs in years. The song is definitely worse than, and below the stamina of other dance songs that she had done before like Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It,) Get Me Bodied, and Crazy In Love. I think it is definitely time for Beyonce' Knowles to retire if she keeps making poor choices in her music, and throws her heart away.		Song: D
1,When I first heard the title of this song, I thought he was singing about someone having a sexy backside. I didn't know he was singing about himself bringing sexy back, as if 'sexy' was ever gone! For real, this song is awful. It has no melody and is just plain emotionless. Justin Timberfake stated in an interview he was trying to bring back the sexiness of the 1980s. Well, he failed big time with this one.
1,Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
1,I love the Hunger Games and really enjoy the music from the movie. At first I though this was going to include a few tracks or sounds from the movie, but came to realize it only one :06 sound byte. Okay if you are looking for a short ringtone, but nothing to hum too all day long.
1,From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.  Nothing at all to sink your teeth into.  Was this a contractual obligation album?  Resting on their laurels?  It will sell because of who we are!  Guys, please don't end your musical career as a band with this one!!
1,I thought this song would just go away and stop hogging all the airplay.	This is not a dream its a nightmare. Completely bland and annoying.	She must be stopped !
1,this really is a beautiful album, and i bet if my mom listened to it, she'd love it.  it's full of piano parts and soft lyrics and it feels like 95% of the songs are slow ballads.  great music to fall asleep to.  i'm not even going to criticize the album for its numerous faults, but if you want to hear a progressive rock album from dream theater, then avoid this one at all costs.  i listened to a handful of the samples on amazon and thought it sounded okay, but i honestly regret buying it.
1,Uninspiring vocals and instrumentation. Just kinda okay
1,not as good as I expected from  Don Henley
1,No complaints about the content, the music is great. The only issue, and a BIG issue, is how MAKES everyone go through the Amazon Music player just to download the music THAT SHOULD OF BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER IN THE FISRT PLACECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR!!!	IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why in the world they feel the need to make you jump through all kinds of hoops simply to get WHAT YOU BOUGHT!!! *People simply want to download it to their computer no strings attached!!* ***This is the most useless hassle I have ever come across in dealing with WHAT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE and straight forward task such as downloading the music you just bought***	I have NEVER met anyone that goes out of their wallet to buy music and prefers it to keep it on a stream player app on their computer-_-  If it was like that they would just keep listening to it on youtube.	Its like the most ANNOYING, USELESS "middle man" there could possibly be. If anyone is PAYING for ANYTHING digital it should be a really BASIC-COMMON SENSE LOGIC that they want it on their computer.and not have it rely on a stupid music stream application where they have to change a bunch of settings JUST TO GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it.	***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can review the music player so Im leaving it here.
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,i don't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of Dolly Parton's song. She oversang and it's just kind of an annoying song to sit through...what a drag...
1,One of the stupidest songs ever.  You would have to be drunk or high to enjoy this brain fart of a song.  This song is an example of the human population getting dumber.
1,never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-		had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!		close to $100 worth of music never received!!
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,Only plays in Amazon app or on mp3 player; not compatible with Apple products.
1,Dinosaur back-up/girl group singer from the '60s put out a real stinker. Her range is long gone. Purchase at your own risk!	Kermit, the frog could out croak her.
1,There are a lot of versions of this song out there. This is not the right one to download. It's taken from a compilation album and starts and ends ubruptly because it was very sloply hacked from the original album.
1,Ty
1,Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.
1,ok
1,I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?		To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.		After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.		On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.		A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):		I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.		If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as "You're just jealous!" or "I'd like to see you do better!" or "How is it in your parents' basement?" or "You must jerk off to your computer!" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:		"Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!"		FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!		If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.		To those of you who would call me "pretentious" or "music snob" or "self-righteous" or "self-absorbed," you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is "simple," (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:		"Devil's Night Out" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones	"Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols" by The Sex Pistols	"The Essential Heart" by Heart	"Highway To Hell" by AC/DC	"Meat Is Murder" by The Smiths	"The Strange Case Of..." by Halestorm	"Greatest Hits" by Tom Petty	"Complete Greatest Hits" by The Cars	"Ugly" by Life of Agony	"Remain In Light" by Talking Heads		As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!		I also wish to point out that arguments such as "Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!" or "You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)
1,One : the song is slow and lame. two : it flat out sucks	three : desperate to keep his career going and four : should of just retire.	justin timberlake is overrated nuff said.
1,I love the ORIGINAL SONG. It does not say someone changed it and added a rap to it. Thats not what I wanted and looking at the ORIGINAL album cover, thats not what was on the song.  Annoyed I paid for a something I didn't want. I have to see if I can find the original. Hey Amazon, when you change a song, let the customer know!
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,THE BEST SONGS ARE ALSO ON LIGHT FUSE, GET AWAY.		Released in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.		There is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.		This is one of those singer/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.		To make a singer/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.		John Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.		It also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.		The album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.		But, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.		The worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.		If you are new to Widespread Panic, get the live CD Classic City and then get the first two CD's, Widespread Panic and Space Wrangler, which are fantastic, five star albums.
1,This is a good song I didn't know Beyonc&eacute; song on it as well as Justin Timberlake but I like the song you something little that too yeah
1,i didn't purchase this
1,Madonna's "Who's That Girl" sets a much faster pace than her "La Isla Bonita" which goes at a slow pace.  The song is marked by spanish motifs and words, obviously her favorite culture.  This song makes me feel good to be a girl.  This song has intrinsic value in my life.
1,Will not buy any more MP3 since I can not download them.  Have not played the music, would like a refund it possiable, but I understand if that doesn't happen.
1,Honestly for Chris Brown, he just really has had a harsh time in the spotlight, since the startling strife from the abuse with Rihanna. Unfortunately, it showed with the lackluster strength of Grafitti, and it is still showing right here on Deuces. His latest single is just not up to par on what it could be for him. He also had that not just in the song, but in his breaking down performance at the BET Awards suring his tribute to Michael Jackson on Man In The Mirror. I think honestly that Chris should really take a longer look into himself and then get back out there. He really hasn't shown that he is reallly ready for a full-length return, aces high but deuces low for Chris.		Song: D
1,Usually Adele does just fine with her music.  Even if it's a song that you don't particularly gravitate towards, you can acknowledge that it is a well-crafted song.  Unfortunately, her song "Send My Love" is not one of those songs.  It is the prime example of all that is wrong with her latest album "25".  The entire album is lyrically and musically lazy.  It tries to coast on the strength of Adele's stellar voice.  It offers nothing else (certainly not the way "19" and "21" provided sharp song-writing and musical arrangements)		  "Send My Love" has several things working against it.  First, it is part of the mediocre "25".  Second, it has been so badly overplayed on commercial radio (well beyond how much "Hello" was played) that even the song's biggest fans or totally sick of it.  Finally, it is just an irritating song.  It has been described a peppier version of Adele's 'bashing her ex' songs.  At this point (3 albums worth), Adele repeatedly bashing her ex in song has gotten quite tiresome.  Make one of those songs with a more energetic musical sound is just obnoxious.
1,I honestly can't stand this song - I just bought it for my dad.  The singing is fine,  I just recall the era when it was over saturated on the radio. *sigh*
1,I had to buy this giant album to get a few songs that weren't available on other albums. Some of the songs are worth it, but most are just repetitive and annoying.
1,Nickelback churn out release after release of poor derived pop rock dribble. There is nothing new from the band, no new angle, no change. It's precisely the same monotonous punchy chord guitar playing, grainy whiney vocals and horribly clichd lyrics that featured on previous albums.		What makes Nickelback all the more insulting is the undeserved popularity. I was over in Canada a little while ago and on one of their rock stations a poll took place, their `rock world cup', this match up was Nickelback vs Pearl Jam, and you guessed it, Nickelback stormed it. Such an insult to Pearl Jam, an original band that Nickelback completely rip the sh*t off.		Quite simply Nickelback's music is mediocre, there's nothing worth listening to. Do yourself a favour and listen to some original guitar driven rock, par example `Soundgarden', `Alice In Chains' or `Pearl Jam'.
1,It is honestly, and sincerely so sad that whenever someone young and talented, has really run out of ideas, with making better for her own music, and better to her own voice. Unfortunately, Ciara has been one of those singers whom has definitely lost her own edge for quite awhile, and sadly, her own career has faded in the wind. With the end of her own relationship with her ex-fiancee Future, and her music falling, she has tried it again with her song I Bet, and honestly the song has lost her own edge in voice and song. Her second single from her Jackie album, Dance Like We're Making Love, does not even try to deliver. I found the song to not even ignite the way other seductive songs have shown in R&B for so many years, like Spanish Guitar from Toni Braxton. If Ciara really wants better, she has not gotten it. I think with all her lagging sales and work, it is time for Ciara to sincerely retire, and start having a new life with her young one.		Song: D+
1,Did not like this remix. Deleted it.
1,as  i  listen  to  taylor  Swift  she  reminds  me  of a  broke  Juice  Newton  an artist  who  had  one  cute  major  hit  and  then  was forever  in the 3rd and 4th tier territory  as a  artist  and  this  is  how  i feel  about  Swift,  though  i  give  her  credit for  keeping product  out and  her  name.  however  she  pulled a  Jewel  in putting out  a  pop  album  while  she  was well established  with a  sound.  Jewel  made a  forgettable  pop  album  and  so  has  Swift.  songwriting is  weak  and  the  production  and  songs do  nothing  for  her  voice. she  is already  overrated  to  me  and  this  album  keeps  that  sentiment  in full  effect.
1,Not at all my type of music, so take my review from that Perspective. I do the occasional DJ party , and needed ( tripe like this to suit the younger crowd. Normally I wouldn't DARE, waste my money on this Juvenile, Pop, Garbage. But There MANY out there that Like it.
1,I don't like writing bad reviews for anything, as peoples styles are as different as night and day.  But I am glad I did not pay for this one...
1,I like their earlier music, but this sucks! I couldn't wait for it to end. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Back in 1995, Jill Sobule had a hit single called "I Kissed A Girl", which had the catchy chorus: "I Kissed a girl, her lips were sweet, it was just like kissing me, but better." It was a catchy and damn fun to listen to. Now 13 years later, a no-talent named Katy Perry releases a damn song with the same song, just less catchy and a scheme to get attention. This is seriously the worst song ever recorded. Not only does Katy Perry have a HORRIBLE voice (Why is she yelling?), but WHO CARES IF YOU KISSED A GIRL? Besides, what's next, I Got It On With A Chicken (And I Liked It)?
1,Didn't like
1,Got for a friend.
1,This a live recording, not the studio version. Not entirely the same feel as the studio version.
1,bought for mom
1,even as a freebie, this was a total & complete waste of my time to listen to. fit only for the trash.
1,Jill's old poetry style needs a lift. Getting off the subject --I believe that Amazon would receive much more feedback on the songs that customers have purchased if Amazon would not make it a requirement to submit an entire paragraph.  The world is busy enough trying to prevent a huge daily accumulation if emails in their mailbox. All of the songs that I purchased from Amazon.
1,While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R&B.
1,I guess I remembered the song differently then when I listened to it now.
1,ITS BS Amazon forces you to download their software medial player in order to download the music you paid for. I don't want their media player. I will never buy music from Amazon again.
1,When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she hasn't really brought out her better songs out there. It has felt more like the same thing she has done before with her songs, which sadly has felt old, and not exciting anymore. She has made so many dance songs, that it doesn't feel like she excites anymore. Live It Up, her first after leaving MCA. Her last album did not do the trick very well, and her cavalcade of consecutive dance songs have felt less intriguing than exciting. Her latest dance song Live It Up with Pitbull doesn't actually feel like she has brought out more than her A game. It feel like the same thing she has done before, from her recent songs like Dance Again, and Goin' In. I really didn't feel Jennifer brought out something different. I think if Jennifer Lopez wants to get out more for her music, she should try and deliver better than feeling like she has done the same song from before.		Song: D+
1,nothing too exciting here. sounds like a john mayer ripoff song...marvin gaye's estate should sue him too like they did to robin thicke( I totally hear the melody of Let's Get It On in Sheeran's song). But they should team up w john mayer and sue ed for plagiarism.
1,I hate Meghan Trainor but had to buy this for someone to use at a work conference.  If I didn't love the company I would rather have lit a dollar on fire than give Meghan any royalties but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.		I did hide it on my Amazon Music account and the company needed it again so I contacted Amazon and they added it back.  Amazon rocks as always with their great customer service!
1,Not sure what is going on here, but this is not the original version of the song. The original song starts off "I saw her standing in the rain...". The sample we get to listen to before purchasing doesn't play the beginning, so I had no way of knowing it had been butchered. This version starts off "I saw her sitting in the rain...". Is that a minor difference? No. I repeat...No. When you have listened to a song for more than forty years no change is minor. I can't believe they would do something like this, but sure enough they did. This was one of my ten favorite songs of all time but now I won't listen to it anymore. Thanks, Cowsills, for ruining something that was beautiful.
1,Hah, how ironic, given that Ellie's voice is anything but powerful! I really wish she would give it up already. Every time she opens her mouth, it just sounds like she's out of breath. Maybe that's a sign that GIRL, YOU CAN'T SING!!
1,Wow! What a disappointment, especially in regards to the hype of the 'new' "Pink FLoyd" album, which itself is a very misleading title. The 'ambient' music (a term I see that is being used quite frequently in reviews for this release) is good music to do yardwork, that is if nothing else is playing! There is not enough of David Gilmour's ethereal guitar sound on this album. He recently did some soundtrack music for a movie called "Vile People" that starred Donald Sutherland. It was scored by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead fame. It was amazing, Gilmour's work was. I absolutely do not like Radiohead but Dave brought that score to life, folks! Where is that playing here?		Oh, the poor souls who spent $30 on the deluxe version, I feel for you guys...You  will be payin that dough for packaging, which is basically a box, two postcards, a hologram and a "hardback book" that contains track notes and some '94 photos of the group.		The music is mainly FILLER, which given that is Pink Floyd means GOOD filler, but filler nonetheless. A lack of searing Gilmour Strat is sorely absent. Only one track has vocals and lyrics, which Mr Gilmour sings, in usual appealing tenor. One reviewer stated it perfectly, that this material should have been release as some sort of companion disc for the reissue of "Division Bell." Shoulda woulda coulda! This material is yet another Christmas cash grab. I've actually listened to the album twice, and the main highlight is the only proper song, "Louder Than Words."		Final Verdict: 4 on a scale of 1 to ten. And for the deluxe package, 2, due to the $30 price tag and lack of anything of substance.
1,I bought this album-- because I've always been a James Taylor fan. Quite frankly, I think he's a little "Burned out," creativity wise. I listened to the first four tracks or so, took it off the CD player, and haven't  been impressed enough for a second playing-to this point.
1,I was looking for meditation music and got elevator music. Why anyone could call it "new age" I don't know.
1,I like her stlye but I expected more from this song. It's missing some flavor. The hook is nice but I'm not feeling the rest of the song.
1,This has to be one of the worst versions of the song I have ever heard. Even my two year old Wheels on the bus expert had issues signing along
1,I love Incubus, but this was a let down.
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,Maudlin, and trite.  It is manipulative in it's emotionalism and it to wrap it in the guise of a Christmas song is inappropriate and in one sense cruel.  Christmas is a time of birth and new beginnings.
1,This track is fascinating because the singers stay in this awkward high note.  This group riddled the early to mid-90's.  If you worked at the time it came on whole yuo were working and shoppers shopped.  You become fond of Ace of Base.
1,I like Jennifer Hudson, but was not feeling this cd at all except for a couple of songs the rest was just ....blah...adds nothing new to the table..oh well maybe next time
1,Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,This was a second song that I wasted my money on because there was too much static on this mp3 track.
1,It's crap.
1,I am a firm believer in giving artists second chances case in point Chrisette Michele . Her last cd left me questioning whether to invest in her work again when previous cd before that was BANGIN . I'm not sure who to point fingers at the label, her producers , the marketing team or the artist. Without a doubt she's beautiful , talented , humble and can belt out a tune or two I'm just not sure what exactly went wrong on this third cd. Out of the entire song selections I can only bare 3 songs to listen to . I understand artists don't want to be forgotten so they get pressure from their labels to drop product, but how about taking the time to get a strong team behind you in every aspect of your career consumers and music lovers such as myself get a little disappointed when artists go from great to garbage. Crossing over to style that isn't yours naturally just to sell music isn't a good move .
1,I didn't order this
1,This album is not Sepultura album. if you are waiting for another Chaos ad or Arise or any other good album Sepultura had with Max then forget it. This is a bad album. All the songs are the same. There is no good rhythm and the music sounds monotonic and without inspiration. Only to very huge fans of Sepultura
1,Seems to have been well received. The selection came off of their wish list so I expected them to enjoy it and they did.
1,I don't really care for it. But I'm not a fan of bluegrass
1,i bought but it never download to my kindle.. very upset about that.. and i really want this sone to listen to
1,song skips so I don't enjoy it
1,Well I'm writing this review to improve Amazon's algorithm on recommended music on my account.		This is going to be brutal.	To be clear I'm a Rivethead/Prog Metal Fan.		Which means if it doesn't have a seven string guitar  thrash line supported by an atmospheric synth line. Don't bother.		Ew, seriously like learn how to play a guitar..
1,Man this guy sucks. Two super bowls ruined by him? Please NFL get ur stuff together.
1,no music is better than some of the music you hear nowadays. music just sucks in general and doesnt work for me.
1,This simply was a little more bass than I prefer. While I am not angst to this style of music, I did not actually appreciate Nehemiah's approach and conviction at communicating the messages.
1,Too slow, I didn't like it.
1,Where is Pressure?		You kidding me?		Only my favorite Billy Joel song ever!		Can't believe they left that off - glaring omission.		I'll pass.
1,I did not get much out of this one. This is not R. Kelly's first gospel tune. However, Clean This House left me flat. Unlike his other collaborations, this one was missing a bit of seasoning.
1,I have heard this song a lot lately, in various stores and pumping through the loudspeakers at the gym before I turn on my ipod. It sounds like something that was designed by a committee to hit that perfect combination of catchy, trendy and completely inoffensive. Somehow it's also gratingly annoying and sticks in your (your here being "my") head for days after it's been heard. It's worse than "It's A Small World After All." Perhaps it's the familiarity of the "Time Of My Life" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise. I might just walk out of the next store where I hear this playing if I am near the exit and don't have a full cart of groceries which I will have to abandon. To the powers that be who decided to assault my ears with the repeated plays of this little gem, please, for the love of all that is good in the world, pick something else.
1,Terrible it won't play on my divice
1,Only got this for a friend.
1,There is so much that can be said for Ciara in her personal life right now. The end of her relationship with her fiancee Future had ended with him cheating on her, and also her music has not really been anything extraordinary. The latest set of songs she had come out with have been poor, than anything that really comes from the impassioned heart. The setup for her last couple of albums Ciara and Fantasy Ride have been much more lackluster than strong. I really did not find the songs like Body Party and Love, Sex & Magic to be anything impressive. Dance Like We're Making Love, the latest song from her upcoming album Jackie isn't anything that ignites at all. She tries to be seductive, but honestly Ciara instead feels more like a whimper alone. The song feels weak and her tone into the song sincerely is not anything that is special. If Ciara really is going to keep making poor songs, I think it is honestly time for her to considering retiring from a music career. Her next album should have better than this song really did.		Song: D+
1,Better than some other Lumineers stuff, but still sucks.
1,Using my free downloads or should I say wasting my free downloads. Coldplay is ok in an elevator but I can't imagine choosing to listen to it.
1,too expensive
1,It wasn't very good. All because of them trying to censor out MF. They did not do a very good job on that. The song is still good, though.
1,For those who think of Katy Perry was really just a poor wannabe artist, that seems what it feels like. Her sound has been more like the depth of Pink had shown with So What. Unfortunately, after I Kissed A Girl, she hasn't really shown herself enough to be a credible singer. Her second single Hot N' Cold, from her debut album One Of The Boys doesn't really feel like it clicks to the listeners' ear. I wasn't really impressed with the strength of the song. It actually felt more like it was a glass of near rancid milk, mixed in with a steaming cup of coffee. She really needs to find catchier songs than this one. Katy really feels like a cold shoulder, and hopefully her next song can really feel more like it is a better bag of tricks.		Song: D-
1,song skips so I don't enjoy it
1,Forced to learn to please my bandmates...what a piece of crap song! Guess I STILL miss my Chicago, BS&T, Tower of Power and oh YES...Allman Brothers tunes.
1,ITS BS Amazon forces you to download their software medial player in order to download the music you paid for. I don't want their media player. I will never buy music from Amazon again.
1,A total waste of two great acting talents, Josh Brolin and John Malkovich, Jonah Hex gets mired in an awkward mess of a script, CGI over-dependence and a plot that feels more like an episode of The X-Files meets Wild Wild West than "Revenge Gets Ugly," the movie's tag line.		When Dr Loveless...I mean Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich) decides he wants to find the "Nation Killer" weapon to nuke President Grant in some sort of Confederate Resurrection plot, the man Turnbull tortured and forced to watch the murder of his wife and child, Confederate Soldier Hex (Brolin) out of 'retirement' to track his old nemesis down. However, Hex has an extra talent via the Crow Indians who brought him most of the way back from the dead; he can talk to corpses once he touches them. If Hex can stop the plot, he will be a free man and forgiven his Confederate and murderous bounty hunter sins. So, OK, a pretty good premise.		But the movie is paced so choppily that its very tough to follow. Both Hex and Turnbull are played in a dry and droll manner, leaving Michael Fassbender to pick up the slack as the sole character to show any sparks. There are some interesting cast members here (Aidan Quinn as President Grant, and both Will Arnett and Tom Wopat are involved), but again, the convoluted script leaves little room for characther development. Megan Fox is here, playing a monochromatic prostitute with a soft spot for Hex. After watching this stillborn mess of a movie, she's probably the only one left who does.
1,When it has come down to collaborations recently, there really have been only a few that actually shined on radio like Lucky for Jason Mraz & Colbie Calliat. But for Justin timberlake, his recent collaborations have been a bit weak heart and soul than what was honestly expected from the man who wanted to bring sexy back. Well that is strained from his recent duets with Rihanna on Rehab and Madonna on 4 Minutes. For Ciara, that strain is also felt too on their collaboration, Love Sex & Magic, the third single from Ciara's upcoming Fantasy Ride album. I really didn't feel the chemistry bewtween the 2 singers heart and soul here. Ciara has had a few weak songs, but this one just didn't feel like it was sensual enough to say that you could believe in Love, Sex & Magic. Hopefully, the next time they collaborate on a song, it could feel a lot more driven.		Song: D 1/2+
1,best for teen appeal
1,There are two aspects of this download that keep me from recommending it.		First would be the random order of the various tracks. They jump all over the place, with an aria from one work, a few tracks from another, etc. It might not be bothersome if you're new to classical music, but it seems awfully disjointed if you're a more-than-average fan of classical music.		Second - and most egregious - is the recording of the "Messiah" that makes up the majority of tracks in this download. This is simply one of the limpest, most-lifeless, bordering-on-amateur recordings I have ever had the displeasure of hearing, and that hearing covers just shy of 50 years worth of listening to classical music.		The very first downbeat to the opening Sinfonia is a train wreck, with instruments sneaking in at different times. The orchestra is OK once it gets going, but it's a rather monochromatic sound. The chorus is the worst kind of neutered, wimpy singing that gets featured in the very worst of HIP performances and recordings.		But the real problem with this recording lies with the vocal soloists, whose singing doesn't rise to the level of accomplishment one can often encounter at high school variety shows. The singing barrels over into embarrassing when the soloists attempt to get artsy and ornament their singing, hilariously so in the bass recitative "Thus saith the Lord," where our musically challenged soloist decides to add a shake to his voice every time he sings the word "shake." Are you kidding me? Hey, why not also spit every time you sing the word "sea" and fake a dry voice when singing the words "dry land?" This is amateur hour writ large.		Good points? The recorded sound is excellent! But what good is that when the recordings themselves can't be taken seriously?		Avoid this.		BTW - if you're looking for a really good recording of "Messiah" as an under-$10 download, then look no further than Johannes Somary's Vanguard recording of the piece. It's currently available as part of three different Vanguard "Big Box" downloads - Big Box Handel (ASIN: B00BK3LPFU), the Big Handel Oratorio Box and Big Box Christmas (ASIN: B00A2KV7XW). That "Messiah" recording has it all - great soloists and chorus, a very good orchestra and an interpretation that is - for lack of a better term - mainstream, yet unique and engaging, and good analogue sound.
1,Well, here we are with another Rob Zombie record that is just kinda "there". Rob Zombie hasn't released a worthwhile solo album in over a decade and every time I get my hopes up that he will make a comeback he just ends up disappointing. Rob said that this album was going to be "heavy" and do things "they haven't done in awhile". I can first and foremost tell you that what he said was a lie. This album sounds exactly like his past couple albums and this one in particular sounds worst with some of the most cringeworthy lyrics I've heard on a Rock record in a long time. The lead single gave this flaw away with the saying of it's title "Well Everybody's F***ing In a UFO" I mean, come on. That title sounds silly and filled with stupidity and that exactly how the song goes as well. I know Rob has always had "weird" titles and strange lyrical themes in his music. Trust me, as a long time fan of Rob Zombie (especially White Zombie) I know. But this album is too far off to be taken seriously. So many of the songs sound like parodies of something else than serious songs. Only positive thing I can say about this album is its guitar tone sounds pretty cool at certain points. Other than that, this album is very passable.
1,I'll probably go to Country Hell for buying this album, but my wife really like this bland crap.  Seriously, what happened to "real" Country?  I grew up on classic 50s Country and actually like lots of modern Country, but this is so bland as to be pre-packaged elevator music.  Mindless drinking songs have been done to death in this genre, don't you think?
1,It was not the clean version.
1,imho it didn't live up to the hype
1,I abhor this song (look that word up, or just guess it's meaning). I also don't like Lil' Wayne's music either. However, there isn't one song by that rapper that I like less than this wretched song.		The writer (and composer!) needs to be given a good shake for composing such drivel.		Everything about it is just plain horrible!		1 star.
1,No. Really, no. Didn't care for it.
1,I've never been that Big on Jewel&sure didn't think She would ever try anything different so I was surprised when I Heard Her lead single off this set. Vocally She is still the same. I See She is Pulling a Leann Rhimes in that She is trying for that Pop Cross-Over Appeal after being on the scene for a good while now.but the Music here&vibe feels like it passed Her by. Her trying to do what Celine Dion is doing now with a Brittney or CHristina type of Sound&Vibe just ain't happening but I give Her Prop points for taking a chance.but, Usher style Album titles just ain't in the cards nor the Sound for Jewel in the Long haul.
1,I always knew she didn't possess one original bone in her body! This song is a total rip off of Sara Bareilles' Brave!! Go listen to it and tell me they don't have the same melody. It's a damn shame - Roar is one of the biggest hits of all time now, yet I bet barely anyone is familiar with the far superior Brave. The world is so unfair.
1,This song is terrible!  It's a below average song that actually gets worse the more you listen to it.  After a couple of times, it actually gets painful! I HATE this song with a passion!
1,Christina  Aguilera  is one  of  those talents where i keep  expecting her to  go full  Etta James and expect a classic song or albums, etc. instead of getting her doing corny 2nd and 3rd tier tracks left over from  lightweight acts. hearing an  album like  this  shows me how desperate  she is to be accepted as to making an artistic  statement.  she has the kind of voice that should be running things and easily showcasing her skills with far better material. autotone,and this  voice don't go. she is more known for being a judge on the  voice than this corny material she is pushing out.she outta be doing a Linda Ronstadt  as to trying to compete with Rihanna. Xtina is better than this.
1,Great song, but after downloading this song I noticed that there was background noise on this particular download. (Tried the download 2 different times)		I called Amazon and they gave me a credit and said they would notify me when the problem was fixed.		Two months and I have not heard anything yet.
1,When it has came down to Britney Spears the past few years, it is really hard to tell whether she is back on track smelling like a rose, or having another mental breakdown. Unfortunately her latest single doesn/t really show she has the appeal she has shown either. If U Seek Amy, the 3rd single from her lackluster album Circus feels like a paperweight in the the mind, and not in the soul of the voice. I found the song to be less appealing even with the spotlight going towards others like Rihanna and I Kissed A Girl maven Katy Perry. She hasn't shown she has the beat back, and unfortunately, neither does this song. So if you really are seeking Amy, tell her to listen to something else.		Song: D 1/2-
1,Sly & The Family Stone originally did the song&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hot-Fun-in-the-Summertime-single-master/dp/B00137Z22A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hot Fun in the Summertime (single master)</a>, 1969 hit and a song Phil Collins stole to make this trash!!!!! DO NOT LISTEN TO THE POSER FANS!! Stick with the REAL Genesis classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Watcher-Of-The-Skies-New-Stereo-Mix/dp/B001KQEG62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Watcher Of The Skies [New Stereo Mix</a>],<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Firth-Of-Fifth/dp/B0018AKCH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Firth Of Fifth</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Knife-Live/dp/B001KQ3J10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Knife [Live</a>] NOT THIS COPIED TRASH!!!!!
1,Generic, derivative, repetitive, boring. In other words, typical reggaeton.
1,How should I put this song? Painful, as in whenever it's on the radio, you have the sudden urge to bash your head into something. The song is one we've heard a million times before, when your lover is gone, you're sad, yes, we know, we get the picture. Stick to being in love with the boyfriend, or hating him, or being jealous over him, or losing him, just not, pining over him being more than ten feet away from you. And good gosh, can this song be any more overplayed on the radio? I mean, if this and "Keep Holding On" were the only songs you knew of her, you'd think she's the worst artist since SoljaBoy.		And read my review of "Keep Holding On," most of it also applies here. So overall, Avril needs to stick to "Girlfriend" and "Sk8tr Boi." Stick with the punk, not the ballads and uplifting inspiration garbage, please.
1,just ok
1,Corey Taylors voice= Just awful. Could use some more chest voice and less nasal screeches.
1,It's got a very familiar sound throughout and if your cool w it...you'll survive. For me, there was a moment of "okay, it's done playing." I didn't want to re listen. Price, bargain though.
1,family member downloaded for their mp3
1,When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she honestly has one of the worst albums that has came out in 2014. Her album A.K.A. has honestly failed to impress not just in music, but sadly going very low in her voice and her heart. She really does not have the drive, within the way she used to, when she came out with On The 6 fifteen years ago. Her song Booty has to honestly one of the worst songs that she has came out with altogether. She and Iggy Azalea really do not have any chemistry whatsoever. It definitely is a low point in Jennifer worse than any of the songs that she has put out in years. This song is just as terrible as the case was with I Luv Ya Papi. If you really wish that Jennifer should've found better in her work, you are not alone. This song is not even worth the time, and the effort. It is time for Jennifer Lopez to retire!! This song is not even worth downloading and the money she recorded to make it.		Song: F
1,Man, 5 years waiting for this? A lot of people proclaim this as being a ''comeback'' to their roots but for me, it ain't even close. This album for me doesn't even come close to their last album, in fact, their self titled album was much better than this. I honestly thought this was generic at best, nothing like they have released before. The opener wasn't even an energetic track like ''Time of My Life, Train, Right Where I Belong, etc''		This for me is a sad wait for a band I had high hopes in coming back strong after losing Henderson and Harrell. Every band is entitled to have a bad album, this one for me is 3DD's album.
1,I have wanted for this to come out and I was let down.  to long to many songs it was a let down
1,When the sample is played it only gives a brief sample of about 30 seconds. That leaves out the end of the song which I find many songs here are cut off at the end. These are typically offerings from Sony. Quality highly resembles the old pirated songs where burn spots left 'boing' sounds and got cut short, difference here is only the cut offs remain now. Often the cover copy \\ fakes come up and recoarse seems too difficult to go after. About 30% of my bought downloads I want a refund on and they offer no fair way to 'make it right' for me.
1,A gift for my daughter and I don't like this modern "country".
1,boooooooooo
1,My two year old was very unimpressed with this song. I think they could have made the songs more child friendly
1,The song is complete trash and very overrated. Zero stars.
1,Yuck. ordered for someone else.
1,If you like Jeff Foxworthy you'll like his treatment of this Christmas classic. This is why we watch and listen to him,i.e., because he's talented.  This song is proof.
1,This song is supposed to be a summer love song, that's sweet and cute, but let me say, Taylor Swift blows this out of the water, and half-way across Asia. Ironically, the two are doing a duet, which is like Rosie O' Donnell doing a duet with Leona Lewis. Totally mismatched.		All sarcasm aside, the song has more cheese than Wisconsin, more horrid sounds than a Chinese takeout kitchen, and more annoyingness than Rosanne. Really, whenever I'm forced to listen to this song at the gas station, I want to light a match, and drop it.		Boyce Avenue's cover of the song at least remotely gives it the emotion it was meant for, but it's still a 4-star song at most since Colbie has now joined the ranks of Kid Rock as the worst songwriters in American history. What makes the whole thing worse though is the fact that it's sort of catchy. It's still catchy enough to cause terminal insanity. So in summarizing, don't listen to this song while eating watermelons with seeds, because you'll choke, and don't listen while you're depressed, because you'll kill yourself. Like drugs, JUST SAY NO!
1,I was searching for some more christmas music to add to my collection each year I want somethjng to play other than our Chipmunks christmas and Soulful Christmas albums. So this works. Thanks for the free music, free is always good, so no complaints.
1,the music sucks only got it because it was free
1,A sad and pathetic display of pure ego, some of the worst junk I've ever had to sit and listen to.	When are these contemporary artists going to stop writing music that might as well have come from the '50s and '60s?  Rock is DEAD, vocals and lyrics are DEAD, the guitar as the featured instrument is DONE.  Rock song structure is so boring because we've had to listen to it our whole lives.  People need to wake up and find that there's a whole nation of artists out there making great music that's called "post rock," without vocals and lyrics, without a dominating guitar, without that awful, repetitive rock song structure.  We are in the post-Christian, postmodern era;  WAKE UP PEOPLE!
1,This is one of my favorite Christmas songs ~ I have it by several artists and like them all ~ until now.	This version of Santa Baby has a very different sound then any other version I've ever heard.	Lachi has a capable voice ~ but I didn't care for the style of the music & odd tempo.	I do like some light jazz but didn't care for this rock-jazz combination ~ which is predominately rock.
1,This was as bad as Run Around. I will not get any of their other music. In the beginning they were great. I don't know what happened.
1,I really don't do drugs (other than legal ones like caffeine), but in listening to this song again, I can't understand why I downloaded it, except for the fact it is free; but if it isn't very good, why download it?  Anyway, after listening to it a couple of times (to make sure I wasn't missing anything), I feel the song is only worth two stars, and I am planning to delete it from my ipod.  I guess everyone makes mistakes; maybe it was a senior moment for me (since I am over 65).
1,Not my favorite kid Rock cd. Worthy of  a list to though. Album NOT fun as last slbums.
1,When I first heard this song, I was like, Wow! Her vocals were good, and then by the bridge, I was totally into the song. And just for a second, I thought she was better than Blake Lewis. Well, those thoughts quickly passed. Not only was Blake Lewis's debut flat-out amazing and underrated, but due to the meat grinder that is radio, this song quickly wore like a pair of pants being dragged down a gravel road. Today, this song blends right into the radio wasteland.		While her vocals are still good, it is nearly impossible to get past the bad writing. I mean really, I know that the love song genre is depleted of all originality, but do you really have to compare your lover to a tattoo? What about the day when a real tattoo removal product becomes widely available? Then this song will become more laughable than it already is.		Overall, if you have been in a cave for the past six months, consider buying this song. But just remember, when you head back for the cave, this song won't be coming with you.
1,I loved the first Sixx AM album, it blew me away.  The new album not so much.  Starts off good, first couple of tracks are hot but it quickly grows cold with tacky lyrics and songs that sound like something I have heard before.		Nothing worse than when you hear a song for the first time and you can finish the artist's lines in the song because they have no creativity to them.  "Cut with a knife", "Angel like you with Devil like Me"... etc.  It's been done before Nikki.		DJ Ashba, amazing.  His playing saves this album.  Can't wait to hear him on a GnR studio album.
1,I recommend that they delete the files for this collection. The music is not relaxing; it is boring. You could hear this in the doctor's office waiting room or the elevator.
1,Disclosure showed so much promise with the last effort.  But, here Disclosure is "Disappointing".  This CD is way too mello and fluffy...in fact this effort reminds me of "PM Dawn"...who i  liked....in 1995!
1,this song is horrible! how is this chick so famous?? it's a big corporate push & a lot of money and financial interests @ stake, invested in her career. The suits who are pushing this would sell ya a turd sandwich if it would make them  a lot of moolah!
1,Openly, when it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been the most over-consumed, shrill artists of the past decade. It has been more of the oversaturation, and her voice stopped showing. That really showed with the lagging of song from her fourth album, 4. Of all the songs she did for that album, Love On Top has to be one of the worst songs she had done. She really let her voice and the tone go badly. The way her high notes are on the song, and not really good. I really wasn't impressed with the song. It honestly has been one of her worst songs she had ever done. Whatever Beyonce' does on the next album, she needs to show that her most important asset, her only asset has to be on top, her voice. Because it speaks louder than words.		Song: D+

1,NOt your problem, maybe my computer is to old.  Use to be able to download, but no more.  Thanks to your customer service for all the help.
1,IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE SONGS ARE STILL IN THE SYSTEM AND I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM AGAIN...I DID NOT RECEIVE ON MY IPOD.....
1,i  was  curious  about them  after hearing there first couple of records  and i didn't know they morphed into Jimmy Buffett?  i'm  hearing this album and it has polished production  and some slick arrangements  however  the songs  don't really  go anywhere.i  was  thinking how this band is puling a rascal flats and other accessible country acts  with pop cross over movements.  slick record  with not alot of memorable material.
1,Thank You
1,No complaints about the content, the music is great. The only issue, and a BIG issue, is how MAKES everyone go through the Amazon Music player just to download the music THAT SHOULD OF BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER IN THE FISRT PLACECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR!!!	IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why in the world they feel the need to make you jump through all kinds of hoops simply to get WHAT YOU BOUGHT!!! *People simply want to download it to their computer no strings attached!!* ***This is the most useless hassle I have ever come across in dealing with WHAT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE and straight forward task such as downloading the music you just bought***	I have NEVER met anyone that goes out of their wallet to buy music and prefers it to keep it on a stream player app on their computer-_-  If it was like that they would just keep listening to it on youtube.	Its like the most ANNOYING, USELESS "middle man" there could possibly be. If anyone is PAYING for ANYTHING digital it should be a really BASIC-COMMON SENSE LOGIC that they want it on their computer.and not have it rely on a stupid music stream application where they have to change a bunch of settings JUST TO GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it.	***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can review the music player so Im leaving it here.
1,Ok First of all the only reason why i ever Love Hillsong was cause of Darlene Zschech. This is the frist time Darlene Zschech is not on a Hillsong album!!! Darlene Zschech has been on every hillsong album from 1992-2012. I always knew a day might come where she would not be on it. I'm more of a Darlene Zschech fan than a hillsong fan. But if your a Hillsong fan you'll love this cd. But us Darlene Zschech fans are sure sad.
1,I am a big Marie fan (since 1976!) but this christmas album is just plain BAD. She scoops the notes all over the place and well, YUK. She's never sounded more like Kathie Lee Gifford than on this CD. I want my $ back because I'll never listen to this again.
1,It's free, hey what can you say. Unfortunately my music doesn't fall under the free category.
1,This remix with justin timberlake should have never been made.	The song itself is not meant to be as a duet. I like the original better.	Last track on the deluxe version of xscape is not memorable.	Pretty pathetic if you ask me.
1,Can't put in my Galaxy S6 library. Can only hear on cloud. Amazon can't help!
1,There is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real, human and uncanny voice, and someone who markets themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is a product, not a real singer. Sadly, the feeling of her music has taken a turn downward with each and every record. When she had made a surprise release for her Beyonce' album, the move might have set sales on fire, but the album itself was a waste of money and time. Flawless, one of her songs from the Beyonce' album is honestly terrible. She doesn't actually ignite in her voice and it sounds more like a robot than a real songstress. I really did not find the song to actually deliver, instead I honestly feel that she brought in her hip hop style, and took it for a tailspin down. It really is one of her more pathetic songs on the album. Perhaps, the next time she comes out with music, than just be a product, she can honestly really feel what a real flawless singer is like. Too bad, there aren't many good ones anymore.		Song: D
1,This mp3 sounds great so my complaint is not about sound quality. However, this song is usually presented as a pairing 'This Beat Goes On/Slippin' To Glide' and it usually happens in a seemless manner. These songs are cult classics and I'm sure the fans out there would love these to be presented in the normal seemless manner. To me it seems like breaking them in two is just a ploy to generate extra revenue. Still, I'm sure fans would pay $2 to have this be one peerless piece of music. I will compare this this to ZZ Top's 'Waitin' The Bus/Jesus Left Chicago' or Queen's 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' - you really shouldn't hear one without the other.
1,Gotta say omarion isn't underated folks album is subpar and honestly Joe's bridges is miles better than this lp and yeah theres better baby making muzak than this. It's amazing how many people believe this album is spectacular sorry but this is a dud
1,filler song
1,I think CeCe Peniston's material represents the 90's decade well.  I like that black turtle neck outfit she wears in "Finally."  I guess "Keep on Walking" is funky as far as rhythm, instruments, and beats go, culminating into a well put together song from the 90's.  "I thought that what we had would never end.."  is obviously a song about a romantic relationship.  Beyonce's "De Ja Vu" and Teena Marie's "Square Biz" are similar to this song's style.
1,I imagine that this would be nice if it was a whole cd,but from what I heard I just thought it was okay.
1,This version is quiet different from the original.  Not as good, in my opinion.  Wish I purchase the original.  I recommend that you pass on this version.
1,When it has came down to Rihanna, musically she has one of the worst ego's in voice and absolute heart. She definitely thinks she can sing, but honestly to soul she sounds like a neurotic robot in rap. Pour It Up, the latest song from Rihanna's Unapolgetic record is definitely that proof in the song. She really didn't deliver a very strong song. AT times, she felt more like she was tired and not enticing. She wanted to try and be a hard core rapper as was the case with Lil' Kim and Beyonce', but instead she ruined her voice. I really do think Rihanna needs to take more time making music, and not rushing herself out there like she is a product. Hopefully, well not really then she will pour it up.		Song: D+
1,I always want to love whatever Dido does, for she has an amazing voice that's extremely unique and expressive.  For the most part, this album certainly isn't something that I dislike, but the safeness of it all definitely turns it into a mediocre listening experience.  While the vocals are pleasant--though nothing past that--the music that backs her up sounds like someone playing around on one of those Casio keyboards that I had a couple of decades ago, on which I'd hit a button and get a drum line, then hit another button and I'd get a bass line. . . .		This album is, quite simply, safe.  Not once do I hear anyone here, vocalist or musician, challenging themselves to do something unique.  By the fourth song, my interest was completely gone, and there was nothing after that that brought my interest back.  I know that if I want to listen to Dido, I'm going to put on "Life for Rent," because songs like "Happy New Year" (which is among the least-inspired songs musically that I've ever heard), "Love to Blame," and "Day before We Went to War"--and virtually the entire album--sound heartless and soulless without significant music behind them to flesh out her vocals.		In an interview, Dido said that there were never any moments when making the songs here was difficult.  I believe that completely because it's very obvious that there was almost no challenge here.  Safe, boring musical tracks backing safe vocal tracks doesn't add up to a work of art here--they add up to a collection of songs that will sell quite a few copies and make quite a bit of money for an established artist, but if this was the work of a new artist, Dido wouldn't be gaining a following with this uninspired fare.
1,It is absolutely awful whenever someone talented has became more of a product than a strong singer. Beyonce' Knowles pulling a surprise record to the music industry, well has had a lot of wasted songs that hasn't delivered from the soul of the heart. In fact most of them  have shown to be more Rap and Hip Hop based than soul based. Her songs from her self-titled fifth record have been more like a drive down from the songs she could've made. Partition from the album has honestly bee one of the weaker songs from the album. She didn't really give it her all in a song trying to be more sexy to her man on the outside, than being a trophy overall. I just didn't find the song to absolutely impress. In fact, I found it to be weaker from the heart than what was from her work before. Maybe when her next album comes out, she needs to have stronger from her work than the wasted songs from this record.		Song: D
1,I was a fan of Marx years ago but wasn't a fan of this album.
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,song skips so I don't enjoy it
1,i personlly think this song sucks not really country either
1,The whole point behind covering a song is to A) better the original or B) shake things up and make it different than the original. So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought "Cool...this just might work!" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's true talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's "I'm Not In Love." I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the "Big boys don't cry" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the "I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with "Under The Milky Way", "Life In A Northern Town" and "Broken Wings." Oh, sure, "Under...." has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on "....Town" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for "Town", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for "Wing"). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal "Human." Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a true testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. "Holding On To Yesterday" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. "Baker Street" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! "Waiting For A Girl Like You" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. "Let's Go Out Tonight" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on "For The One." Much like "Human", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to "Miss You Nights" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! "Blue Rose" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. "Cry" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics ("You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb"), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with "Imagine", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).
1,When buying this song "Everytime We Touch" by Cascada listen to the top three tunes. The third one down or the one that is the slowest version is the most beautiful and romantic. She lets herself flow into the song when it is slower. The faster version feels likes she's trying to race to get to the end of the song. Do not recommend the fast version at all. Yanou's Candlelight Mix CD of this song with Cascada is supreme and melts your soul and heart.  jk
1,I don't care if it is free-I don't want Christmas music in March.  Please reverse this order!  I am frustrated!
1,The lesson here might be to stay away from records produced by Paul Butler. Don't know for sure that he's to blame, but what else accounts for songs that seem to have funky R&B potential buried in them but emerge from the studio mired in a sonic morass of indistinguishable mediocrity?  The second track manages to rise above it on the strength of a killer guitar line and syncopated arrangements that play off it, but much of the rest of the album gives the impression that after exerting themselves on that cut, the band and producer just didn't have the strength, or care enough, to put the same effort into other cuts. And its not like the potential isn't there. The band and producer need to get their Sly and Terrence Trent D'Arby records out, go back to the woodshed and figure out what makes R&B music great.
1,asdf
1,This collection is comprised mostly of Eastern artists.  Jim Brickman and Andreas Vollenweider are the wild cards.  However, there's very little of an Eastern influence.  Most of the tracks are elementary-sounding, major-key piano pieces.  As background music, this is OK, but there's not much to hold your attention.
1,This song is so very poor. It's not memorable, it's abusively basic in flow. Nothing special. I hear no good singing either. She gets loud but so do Howler Monkeys. But some of these "artists" have dedicated fans, and maybe very rich (which is the very likely reason why her song[s] become "Hits") and it's no wonder droppings like this become Top songs.
1,ok
1,ok
1,I would like my money back
1,I'm not sure what I expected, but the combination of these three sounded like it could make for an interesting track.  It's just WEIRD imho.
1,Great!
1,I love Tameka, but not sure where she was with this one... I support all her projects but this wasn't a good look sweetie
1,It didn't download but I was sure charged for it! I've had that problem with other downloads on Amazon. I refuse to buy any more.
1,Got this for free, and have never heard of the band or song title, so have not even listened to it yet. Thanks:)
1,Don't get me wrong. I love Jeff Lynne and his Beatles inspired masterpieces like Do Ya, Living Thing, Telephone Line and Overture from the first album No Answer. But this is a horrible overproduced, inspired by the mainstream disco production of the time. A turd in Lynne's catalog of jewels
1,This album is horrid.  When we have lyrics like "life can be just like a game boy, full of frustration and joy, pressing A or B make a choice....Game over game over...". Yeah no kidding GAME OVER. That portly written song also has the best opening riff sadly.  Once again the songs are so poorly written is ruins the whole thing and not a decent riff here or there can save this.
1,First off, what is the point of this "duet?" Because from my viewpoint it is at best a vehicle for Beyonce, and a god-awful one at that. How bad is this song? In the original version, where the song was treated like art, not a marketing tool, Justin Timberlake gave his best vocal performance yet with a 5-star croon. Here, with the shoving of Timberlake, and the addition of Beyonce, she sounds more like the cat whose tail has just been stepped on. To put it mildly, Beyonce is a horrible singer here, and she ruins a perfectly good song. Also, it's not a "duet," but rather, insert Beyonce over the original track, nothing more, nothing less.		Overall, please don't buy this pathetic excuse for a song. It's one of the flat-out worst quality of song in 2007, Period.
1,When it has came down to new artists they have to really find their voices. Sevyn Streeter, whom sung back up for Chris Brown on his Michael Jackson sampled hit She Ain't You, has a lot to prove from her own spotlight. Sadly, for her debut single It Won't Stop, I found the song to not even ignite at all. It felt more like Chris Brown was taking over with the song a bit more than her rhythm. She really didn't bring out more from the voice to stand and drive her sensual rhythm. I think if she wants to thrive in it for the long run, she needs to find ore from her voice to say it won't stop. Because for her and from her, it just didn't feel like it stood from the song. Hopefully, if her debut record comes around, there will be more than just a second of heartbeats in song.		Song: D+
1,not good
1,Middling second album has the boyz in top vocal form, but the material they work with here is very, VERY average.  "I'll Make Love to You" is a safe, radio-friendly, G-rated ballad courtesy of Babyface, and even Jam and Lewis stumble on the through-the-motions "On Bended Knee."  Only on "Water Runs Dry" do things get a bit interesting.  It sold a gazillion copies, but does that really speak for album's quality?  Boyz II Men's sophomore offering is not quite a disaster, but it's a very dull record that plays by the rules and does nothing more.  Is that supposed to be progress?
1,This group basically performs the same song with different lyrics. Listen to Tornado and Pontoon...same melody, different bad lyrics. What has happened to country music when this garbage is popular?
1,song
1,another corny ass dance song for the Hialeah Soccer Mom crowd and the little Miami Teenybopper crowd. The singer, Havana Brown, i am assuming she's called, sounds like a low rent Rihanna. In other words, an un-unique, pedestrian dance pop singer that sounds like every other dance pop singer on the radio. Not the absolute worst song out there, but pretty awful neverthelesss.
1,This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!
1,didnt care for this app at all...thought it would be entertaining and exciting but wasn't impressed with it at all....
1,this song cusses too much so it is not a good song i will not be listening to this song anymore
1,i bought 3 of this song and they were all the same. they were live proforments. i was looking for one i could line dance to.  they were not good of line dancing.
1,You'd have to PAY me to download this piece of crap. Song has a skip in it anyway- karma's way of acknowledging a bad idea.
1,This crappy song isn't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a$$ Target commercial that try to be hip by playing some mainstream hipster tunes
1,Not only did this track have a lot of static but it plays with a drag, in other word its like playing an old-fashioned 45 record and the speed is too slow.
1,True country music fans will see RED but not this type of red.  This is a perfect example of why there is almost no country music anymore.  It's also a good example of why this marketing approach has contributed to the progession of digital format so fans can get the one good song (if they can find even one) and ditch the rest of the album.  Real country music is hanging on by a thread, and about all that's keeping it alive is Dwight Yoakam standing by the side of the road holding a sign that says, "Anywhere But Nashville".
1,Deleted it from my files.
1,ok
1,i bought 3 of this song and they were all the same. they were live proforments. i was looking for one i could line dance to.. they were not good of line dancing.
1,How can you give this movie anything but a 1 star? I would give it less if I could. This is not a place to review the comic (DC) or what he had on his belt. It is a review of the movie. And most of the reviewers have not seen the movie, and I do not think most people will see it, WITH GOOD REASON! Its total box office in its first weekend was a whopping $5,085,000. That is pathetic! They were hoping to cash in on Megan Fox. It did not work. It is a rehash, redone to death, shooter film. Its jokes are old, its plot line is old, and its action is old (oooo big bang, big explosion, big guns)		If you have nothing to do, and I mean nothing, including watching paint dry, go see this movie and waste your money and time.		0 out of 5 Stars.
1,For some reason this collection in the popular VoxBox series is just flat out boring.  I tried listening to the set repeatedly but just found the selections flat and dull.
1,After Chrisette Michele's debut album her second album Epiphany left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't exactly a knockout punch and was more like a sophomore slump.  Others liked it but I felt it was lackluster and pedestrian.  I left that album completely disappointed especially since her debut, in my opinion, was a classic.  When I found out Chrisette would be releasing a new album I kinda felt indifferent about it.  On one hand she was featured on my favorite song of the year Rick Ross' Aston Martin Music in which she absolutely brought her A game and on the other hand I was still disappointed about Epiphany.  I found out she would be releasing a mixtape to whet the appetites and to serve as a prelude to the new album.  I downloaded the Love Thy Brother mixtape and largely thought it was wack.		So I came into the album with rather low expectations and after listening to the album I'm still not happy about the output.  Let Freedom Reign is not cohesive and features songs that are clearly out of place.  There's a few songs where she channels her former self such as If Nobody Sang Along, I Don't Know Why But I Do, and I Sang Along but those moments of goodness are few and far between.  So In Love ft. Rick Ross is an above average song as well.  Both of the singles are weak; Goodbye Game & I'm A Star.  They lack personality and are pretty much standard fare and with a talent like Chrisette we need more than the standard.		It pains me to say this but again Chrisette Michele has failed to deliver the goods.  For me, that's two albums in a row and that's unacceptable.  I cannot recommend this album especially on a release date that's crowded with better efforts from Jazmine Sullivan, Ron Isley, El DeBarge, Miguel, Eric Benet and Slim Thug.  In other words, you can pass on this one unless you are a die hard Chrisette Michele fan. 2.5 Stars.	A
1,Not what I expected. I was so upset that I even purchase this. Did not keep me interested. I tried to keep an open mind.
1,Not great version
1,Really bad CD
1,I like that Amazon offers wide variety of free music it gives me a chance to listen to artists or genres that I might otherwise pass by.
1,not what I expected, just not my style
1,Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
1,It is pretty pathetic that what most 'kids' want to hear is a bunch of lousy music which will not be remembered much after the pop stations stop playing it.  The music on this is meant to be highly accessible and easily forgotten.  Personally, when it comes to today's music, I have to go with Arcade Fire or bands which have been around for awhile.  I consider this to be instant gratification music for those . . . . and then it's gone!  Thank goodness for the latter.
1,only 1 song i like
1,Ledisi is less than average...there, it had to be said! if hating on this album is wrong, then i'ma be wrong. being a good poet doesn't always equate to being a good recording artist. she is definitely different than anything else being offered out there now, and i'll always give an artist props for originality, but i'm just jaded and expect more for my money. this just doesn't move me, sorry.
1,Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need....well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.
1,If ever there was a song that aspires to be something more, but leaves you feeling 'meh', this is it.  Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande are already big time, chart-topping talents.  Jessie J is getting close to that status (already scoring hits with "Domino" and "Price Tag").  "Bang Bang" is a song designed to bring three sexy powerful voices together for a sexy, raunchy tune.  It ends up being just an 'ok' song (more like a 2 1/2 star song, rather than the 2 I'm giving it).		  It's hard to quantify why "Bang Bang" doesn't deliver.  Though, in all likelihood, it is because the studio over-produced this track, which typically happens when multiple big talents are brought together.
1,What a great artist. Great voice, great music, great all around. I love this artist and I the success continues.
1,I can not download this music to my Media player.  Had I known I could download, I would not have purchased.
1,Katy Perry returns with another song destined for the top of the charts, "Roar".  Ms. Perry doesn't break any new ground with the song (it is basically nicks the tune of Sara Bareilles' "Brave" completely), so long time fans will certainly lap it up by the truckloads.  Most of Ms. Perry's work is generic pop and "Roar" is another mostly pleasant, but forgettable number.
1,These guys stink, just like any so called "punk" rock today. Don't buy this.
1,When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, musically, she really hasn't been able to thrive back to the top of the charts. After the dissapointing albums Brave and Rebirth, she needed to hit on the nail on the head with returning back into the mainstream. Sadly a few years ago, that didn't happen well when she failed with Loubotons and the poor Frsh Out The Oven, and a bad performance with her falling on her behind at the 2009 American Music Awards. It has been nearly 2 years since she made her plans with the long-awaited Love?. With also a shift of labels, being dropped from Sony and moving to Island Def Jam, she needed to make a new splash musically to work. That was a minor splash with On The Floor, and a weak follow-up with I'm Into You, the second single from the long-awaited Love? The song is a tried and not so true attempt to get back to square one musically to the way she was as a entertainer. I really wasn't feeling the song at all. It really was not anything that felt organic to what she should've been able to do. Hopefully, Jennifer will keep trying to do better as a judge on American Idol. She still continues to show that she doesn't have the strength as a singer anymore.		Song: D
1,this was a mistake
1,I was searching for some more christmas music to add to my collection each year I want somethjng to play other than our Chipmunks christmas and Soulful Christmas albums. So this works. Thanks for the free music, free is always good, so no complaints.
1,I used to like this song but I'm not crazy about Nicki anymore. The sound quality is good. The song starts where it should and ends where it should. Doesn't have an awkward cut off. No complaints.
1,Meh.
1,It was good then the radio wouldn't stop playing it. Now I regret buying it. Song makes no sense. And listening to it hurts your head.
1,This song becomes more and more depressing as time goes along so I deleted it.
1,heard this song a few times on the radio days before the super bowl and it just sounds very tacky.	To have Nicki Minaj on this track is just plain awful.	Hears some advice would you please retire ?
1,Just the same words bunched together,  incoherently.
1,there are bits and pieces of some beautiful music here.  But I find it annoying that the album presents only a few minutes (perhaps one movement of a symphony) and then moves on to something that is often quite different.
1,I didn't like this song sorry
1,Crap
1,This was some useless version with a bunch of crap that had nothing to do with the original song. Frankly I was cheated!
1,It is honestly and absolutely so sad that when someone young and talented, really has thrown their own career away. For Nicki Minaj, she has really made more music that has been mediocre and lacking real drive as a rapper. The list of songs she has put out for her Pink Print album has definitely wasted her own talent away, than a real sense of what real talent is suppose to be. Her collaborations with others on the album have really dragged her talent down, Only for example with Chris Brown and Drake among others, just really was one of her worst songs in her own career. Feeling Myself is another example. Her collaboration with Beyonce' doesn't actually ignite any heart by bringing in the so-called queen bee into the mix. I really found the song to be less than striking at all. Nicki and Beyonce' have absolutely no chemistry together. I think Nicki really has made some very poor songs from her Pink Print album, and this is honestly one of her weakest.		Song: D
1,Since some 'highly confused' folks gave this dog of an album five stars, I thought I should add a new review in to warn anybody who is even thinking of buying this sham that is it nothing but a collection of crappy remakes. Pathetic!		(Sad: Remember when K-Tel put out some good collections of original hits?!?)
1,They complain about Rappers writing beating your woman songs, but why can country singers write beer drinking songs and its ok. Does drinking a beer solve everything ?? I think not.
1,This is another case of where I'm not going to completely penalize the real talent on this track, Rita Ora, with a one-star review just because she is collaborating with the atrocious Iggy Azalea.  Rita Ora's voice is fun, sexy and powerful.  She has some solid hits so far and will be a talent to be reckoned with for quite some time.  Her contribution to "Black Widow" is solid.  Unfortunately, she is pair with Iggy Azalea due to music industry's current obsession with forcing audiences to believe Iggy is actually talented.		  "Black Widow's" success on the charts (going as high as #3 on Billboard) is due to Ora's presence.  This is the case with all the other high charting songs that Iggy has road coattails on ("Problem", powered by Ariana Grande, and "Fancy", powered by Charli XCX).  When the current fad is over, Iggy will be gone any relevance in the music industry.  Rita Ora, on the other hand, will be around.
1,I thought this was going to be the arrangement I remember from the 80's.  The singer's voice sounds too abrasive.  I really don't care for this version at all.  Oh well.... a fool and her money are soon parted...
1,This is the song from the movie FEAR with Reese Witherspoon in case you were looking it up for that reason.
1,I was hoping for more traditional sound but this is more 50's-60's pop sounding to me. I deleted it, not worth the space it took up to me.
1,AC/DC fans will love to rock out with the Masters of Rock. The recordings are great, the hits keep coming song after song.
1,This is one of the originals and it is OK. Rarely heard anymore but good listening for easy music time.
1,Purched by mistake.
1,Would not purchase this album again. With the exception of "Girl on Fire", the remaining tracks are o.k. but not exciting.	Should have purchased the single download!
1,Glad it was free. I would not have paid for this. He was better at pop songs rather then Christmas songs.
1,i bought 3 of this song and they were all the same. they were live proforments. i was looking for one i could line dance to.. they were not good of line dancing.
1,Purchased by an ex-friend who figured out how to hack my account 4+ years ago.

1,I tend to avoid albums like this, generally because by the time they are released, the tracks on them have appeared on up to half a dozen greatest hits sets already. For the life of me, I can't see any reason for albums like this, other than greed & the lust to milk the cash cow even further. It's a bit like DVD's where you get the original release, then the "special edition", then the 2-disc set with extra bits not seen in the theatre release, then the director's cut, then the "ultimate edition" and so on, ad nauseum. Lets get real here, the record companies are not stupid; they see a way to leech more money out of the die-hard fans, & they will. It's as simple as that! And sadly, none of the artists have the ethical conscience to say to the companies, "hey, haven't we already released greatest hits albums?" Why do we have to re-release them under a new cover, & call it a new release? It's all about the mighty dollar, baby, and they all do it. Now, having said that (& got my feelings of disgust for record companies of my back), this album has one (yes, just one) positive - it has one of the best cover versions of "Ring of Fire" that I have ever heard. Great vocals from Alan, great production, & great instrumental backing. Now this is the kind of number I'd like to hear Alan doing in future. Put "Freight Train" behind him (every artist is allowed to make one disaster in their career), and look to churning out numbers that have some life in them. Alan, go back to your roots, check out your first 3 or 4 albums, and start again. Lets have more of the kind of songs that put you on the map as a genuine country singer, and put an end to the lame & tame rubbish like "Freight Train".
1,Doesn't seem to have any direction. Keeps repeating the same few beats over and over and over again. Not really as exciting as it might have been. Sounds like someone was rushing this to put it on a CD by a deadline.
1,Like a cheap variation of Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions, Still Corners' `Endless Summer' comes of more boring and snooze-worthy than hypnotic and haunting.  The musicality seems stolen from better tracks and the whispered vocals don't emote the way that they should.  The song is trying desperately to encapsulate avant-garde but instead it feels pointless and insipid.  The song title also says a lot for the track itself, which comes across very long despite barely running over three minutes.  The lack of musical depth and the breathy vocals (which at times grate the eardrums) exasperate the track, making it feel as if it were running on and on.  It overstays its welcome rather quickly.		I'm just glad this was free.
1,this one if you download than you are the first it will say its upload but its not i did this for my computer and my Iphone it took up a lot of time and it cuts in and out all the time.
1,I honestly can't stand this song - I just bought it for my dad.  The singing is fine,  I just recall the era when it was over saturated on the radio. *sigh*
1,I listened to Nevermind twice--that's all I could stand.  I can't find a single good song on the CD.  The lyrics are ill-pronounced, there's little sense of melody, and there's too much incoherent yelling.  On most of the songs the chord introductions are too long, and often the drums are too manic (aka noisy).
1,Dumb
1,garbage
1,I know 'It's Five O'clock Somewhere' is a good song because I've heard it done well at many square dances.  But I was very disappointed with this version.  I know a local square dance caller who does it much, much better.
1,not my favorite Brittany album but it was okay overall.	would not by it. Maybe just borrow it from the library next time.
1,I'm clearing off my review list. This was a purchase for someone who WANTED it. Thus, they liked it. I personally am not a fan.
1,Drake has a standard style to all his songs.  It usually involves him trying to be soft-spoken ladies man trying to woo his next conquest.  He often incorporates an atypical music component and, sometimes, has a featured female singer.  "One Dance" has all those 'Drake-ian' elements to it and the result is uninspiring.  The heavy-duty Drake fans won't listen to such blasphemy (after all, they did push it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100), but an objective analysis has to be honest.		  Drake's chosen musical component is an odd, auto-tuned series of exotic horns that seem over-produced.  While this part is mediocre, the real shortcoming is featured singer, Kyla.  While Kyla appears to have been around for several years and has had some success in the industry, her contribution to "One Dance" is just bad.  Her 'verses' simply do not match the flow of the song.  They are slow and disjointed and she is also trying too hard to be sexy.
1,Because it is important to help companys know that there product is good,and that the people than will enjoy it and buy it.
1,They play this song so many times when this "came out" and gosh will he ever go away?	He's overrated and needs to work at mcdonalds cause no ones lovin it.
1,Best album since Dog & Butterfly, 5 stars, best since 1980s Bebe Le Strange, Harks back to the old classics, etc.  Give me a break!  Had this album been released in the 70's, it would have been reviled!  Remember when that happened to Magazine and in spite of the disappointments, Magazine is a FAR greater album than Fanatic. There are some good songs on the new CD but a lot of it is bland, experimental, and just plain average. You have to go all the way back to Brigade in 1990 if you wan't to talk a truly great Heart CD! This is NOTTTTT a great Heart CD, raving fans on here are WAYYYY to easy to please giving reviews like this for this album.  Like what are you even hearing?  Go back and listen to their 70's and 80's albums before the long layoff.  Heart since that decade long layoff has NEVER been the same!
1,What is it with country music? It is SO predictable, all sounds the same, and the voices do too. I thought I would give this album a chance since the title track was covered by Shakira and Keith Urban on American Idol in recent times. I have listened to the album 5 times and it is so boring. Not one track stands out as an amazing composition. In fact it sounds like Taylor Swift at times. It sounds like other country singers too. Why do people like this sort of music? Country music is almost as bad as listening to rap.
1,This is a major thorn in my side! This album was on sale on the Amazon player. I hit play to play MY Music and it starts downloading this! I never wanted it! But I got charged for it! The player should not put the store first.  Now when I go into my Cloud it says this album is there?  I clicked on it to find out what it is, it wants me to pay for it to be downloaded when I already have! Please Amazon fix this!  I hope nobody else has had this problem.
1,Uh...not very interested.
1,this was a purchase for my boyfriend so i can't really say but its ok to hear it ever once and a while
1,I don't know why this song got so popular. Sure, it has a good beat but is nothing spectacular. It's a typical summer song that is utterly forgettable.
1,This is just pop music.  Zac Brown has a good voice, but the beat of the music is formulaic, boring and nothing which has Zac Brown separate himself from others who put out middle of the road pablum.
1,Where is Pressure?		You kidding me?		Only my favorite Billy Joel song ever!		Can't believe they left that off - glaring omission.		I'll pass.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ......oh you stopped playing Jacks new CD..guess I can wake up now. Same old sleepy music that all sounds the same. Boring boring boring.
1,When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z. They have had other collaborations for her career like the wasted Deja Vu, and the recent Drunk In Love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart, and Bonnie & Clyde '03. It isn't a good song, because it has been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband. Still, there needs to be better in voice and being crazy in love.		Song: D+
1,Never heard of Nicki Minaj until I heard this song.	Getting overplayed and become an opening act for britney spears femme fatale tour.	You won't get pass the first 30 seconds of the song. Completely Unlistenable
1,This to me is the worst type of elevator music, although I am sure it is excellent for hypnotherapy purposes, meditation or falling asleep
1,ok
1,When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been a product as a singer, and not really a human singer. Sincerely, and sadly the quality of her songs have absolutely been awful. The surprise album she pulled out last year has had some really bad songs from Partition to Pretty Hurts. But her latest song is definitely one of biggest low points, trying to be a edgy hip hop artist, and instead throws it all away. Flawless, the latest single from her lackluster self-titled record is really a pathetic song. She doesn't actually deliver from each and every note. Not only is the chemistry she and Chimamanda awful, it sadly is just as poorly overplayed as her work with her husband Jay-Z on Drunk In Love. I think Beyonce' should re-consider finding her own voice again, and stop rushing records that make her weak from the heart, and more flawed in the soul.		Song: D
1,I would like my money back
1,This is very folksy, and clearly distinctly Christian-sacred in its tone. It sounds quite amateurish--like something that you might here at a college chapel service during praise and worship.
1,It didn't download but I was sure charged for it! I've had that problem with other downloads on Amazon. I refuse to buy any more.
1,How can I review this when it didn't download? I was told to call here and there-now THAT'S too much trouble. I have learned to NEVER download a single song for my MP3 player again from Amazon or iTunes.
1,The remake by tiny tim is 1,0000 times better than the original. the truth hurts folks get use to it.
1,Neil Patrick Harris has been very lucky to somehow make a career out of a terrible tv show but it's even more ridiculous to think that he wants to try Broadway. I have no idea what his talent is, but acting and comedy clearly is not.
1,just not my style
1,I'm a huge Kendrick fan but this, this was like left over music that he should have kept left over. it was uninspiring even with the strong lyrical content.
1,It is absolutely so sad that a artist can push the envelope so much, that they are just so tiring and more annoying in their music. Tragically, Rihanna is one of those artists that really made their own sound so severely overexposed, that Rihanna has now been more of a product, and less of a songstress on the inside. With all the hype that she had put out for her Anti album, she really has felt more like a whimper, and more of a joke of herself. When I first heard Work, I not only thought the song was poor in her voice, where she sounded tired and choppy, or someone who was experimenting on drugs, but she really doesn't have anywhere else to go, to find better inspiration that just go on replay with the same sounds over and over again. Kiss It Better was no better, and that also goes with Needed Me, the third single from the Anti album. I definitely found the song to be one step back from her earlier, earlier work like S.O.S., and Umbrella. She really didn't even come close to where she could ignite beyond aflame, and instead saw afire get dowsed into small ashes of the soul. I really found the song to be a waste of time, and on the ears. Perhaps, Rihanna should just go off and retire, because her sound is sincerely short of being needed.		Song: D 1/2-

1,When Nirvana released their second album Nevermind in September of 1991, thankfully it was ignored in its first few months as heavy metal bands like Guns and Roses and Metallica ruled the rock and roll mainstream with their Use Your Illusion 1 and 2 and Black Albums respectively plus Anthrax, Judas Priest and Megadeth released great albums amidst the hair metal trash.	Then, around either December of 1991 or January of 1992, MTV started playing the video for Nirvana (or as I called them NERDVANA)'s "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and I said to myself, exact words and this was not a made up story and I quote "I see the lead singer (Kurt Cobain) is a left handed guitarist like Jimi Hendrix and I predict he will die in three years" end quote. In 1994 (almost three years after this album was released), my prophecy came true as he offed himself like a yellow dog.	Cobain, unlike Hendrix, was a deplorable guitarist and un-revolutionary IMHO!	Nirvana were not revolutionary despite what those fools at Rolling Stone and Spin magazine claim, Nirvana were basically a safe version of The Sex Pistols and The Clash (despite the fact that Dave Grohl was the only true talent in Nirvana as he is a great drummer, singer and rhythm guitarist). It irks me to see people compare this album to real classics like Dark Side of the Moon, Who's Next, Sticky Fingers, Hotel California and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Nevermind is overrated.	Aside Teen Spirit, other lousy songs were "In Bloom", "Come As You Are" (should have been titled "Don't Have a Gun") and "Lithium" (who would write a song about a sedative to combat hyperactivity). "Territorial P*ssings" sounds like he was writing about a pack of wolves marking their territory. "Endless Nameless" was annoying. "Drain You" was silly.	Whom in the blue Hell came up with naming a generation "X", last time I checked Generation X was a punk band that Billy Idol was in back in the late 1970s. I get down on my knees and seriously thank God I dove heavily into Queen's music when Nirvana were at their peak. Also, people comparing a real rock legend like John Lennon to, what "The Motor City Madman" Ted Nugent aptly called a "weenie", Kurt Cobain was like comparing solid gold to tin foil. Lennon was about happiness and wanting peace in the face of all negativity and horror in the world we live in whilst Cobain just whined, complained, p*ssed and moaned and cried about how bad his life was and wanting to die and sounded like a three year old who had his toy taken from him.	Avoid this and any Nirvana album!
1,Michael Buble has made a fortune covering great old standard songs that were originally made famous by Frank Sinatra and others.
1,Nope!
1,It is a really anointing repetitive song that says the same thing over and over again  the beat is terrible
1,Song is just okay.
1,When it has came down to what Kanye West has delivered in his art, it has sincerely been more about being selfish, than a strong rapper. Unfortunately, his latest set of songs with Paul McCartney, on Four Five Seconds with Rihanna and One Love, were songs that sincerely weren't his best songs. But with so much of his career, being more focused on being Mr. Kim Kardashian than being a strong rap artist, he just doesn't seem to drive his heart into his work. Kanye's song, All Day isn't exactly a strong rap song, but taking out things on others. He sincerely doesn't put his all in the category genius to his work, and instead takes it back a little too far to his earlier works. He had much better song several years ago, and instead his song lately have been wasted from the heart. I really think when Kanye West does put out a new album, he should wear more of his heart from his earlier sleeves.		Song: D+
1,There does not need to be yet another Al greatest hits album.....just more of the same here, nothing new and it's not that great to begin with.
1,Songs i purchsed from amazon won't play even when i downloaded amazon music , it sucks and i won't purchase from amazon anymore and I'll let my facebook friends know to not purchased from amazon if this is not fixed.
1,The remake of cry me a river by Gabriella Cilmi is a 1000 times better than the original.	Justin quit whining and stop embarassing yourself.	Lessons To Be Learned (Amazon MP3 Exclusive)
1,They play this song so many times when this "came out" and gosh will he ever go away?	He's overrated and needs to work at mcdonalds cause no ones lovin it.
1,Just the other day, I was sitting in my room, listening to Sgt. Pepper and thinking to myself, "Man, this album is okay. But what it really needs is a bunch of spacey noise and auto-tune. And more freakouts and distortion and weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Yeah, that would make this album awesome."		Then, lo and behold, the Flaming Lips and their "fwends" release this album. Wow, it's like fate!		Back to reality...		I've been a fan of the Flaming Lips since the 90s. They have released some excellent albums that will stand the test of time. Unfortunately, they've become a band of gimmicks as of late (gummy skulls, ridiculously long songs, blood, etc.). This is the worst gimmick of all. This is a complete embarrassment to music. The cover of "Lucy" was enough on its own. Was it really necessary to cover an entire classic album? That's a question that really doesn't need to be answered out loud.		Is it worth listening to this? Maybe once, just to experience the horror. However, I will leave you with this warning: you will never be able to forget you listened to this travesty. I only hope that one day I can again listen to Sgt Pepper without being reminded that this atrocity exists.
1,I simply don't understand the hype. Same tired formula seems to be applied to all Beyonc&eacute;'s recorded output. This stinks as bad as her solo work. All you have to do is look at the songwriting credits for the song to see exactly how little talent and songwriting ability Destiny's Child actually has. (Let's see...It was written by Beyonc&eacute;, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Fred Jerkins III, Sean Garrett, and Shawn Corey "Jay-Z" Carter- IT TOOK 8 PEOPLE TO WRITE THIS CRAPPY SONG???? )Geez, it took an army just 2 write 1 WORTHLESS song...
1,Is there ever a good day to be in a fight?  Song is a lament of the hardships (relative, of course) we experience daily.	I'd give the band another try despite not being too crazy about this particular tune.
1,Sara Groves is a great singer-songwriter, and has written some absolutely fabulous songs.  Unfortunately, this CD misses the mark, and is by far the weakest of her releases.  The CD is lacking the lyrical and melodic depth of her better songs, and, as noted in other reviews, has a mass-produced CCM sound that does not serve her well.		For Sara's best, check out "Other Side of Something", "Conversations", and her most recent release, "Fireflies and Songs".  Each of these CD's include songs that are as good as any music produced in the last 10 years.		Nobody's perfect . . .
1,It's alright
1,Can not download to my media player.  Talked to Samjit and Armar in your customer service department, and they really tried to help me, but it did not help.
1,Didn't really like the album
1,If you are interested in this music get a better recording.
1,There is no question about why Kelly Clarkson hasn't really been able to shine in her songs lately. They all have felt exactly the same on top of each other. She hasn't been able to get herself seperated from her American Idol image very well. Her latest single doesn't seem to really shine that brightly to my ears. I Do Not Hook Up, the second single from her 4th album All I Ever Wanted feels like it is just one in the same from her pervious earlier songs. It really isn't a great song after a few times, and feels like it has lost its luster very quickly. I overall wasn't very impressed with all the tracks from All I Ever Wanted, and for Kelly, she needs to find something different to seperate herself from the same angry-driven songs she has created for awhile. She doesn't really hook up at all.		Song: D
1,The copy is ok, but this is a pretty boring version of this song, if you ask me.... which you kind of inadvertantly did by reading my review.		Im jusssayin'	:p
1,Think I'll go listen to my Sinatra albums. Seriously there are enough 1 and 2 stars to get a true idea. The 4 and 5 star reviews are kidding only themselves. 1st Dylan lp I truly regret buying
1,Sony Music shortchanges Lauper by only giving her one disc (and 14 tracks only!!!!) She deserves much better, and this is what it should look like:		Disc One:		1. Money Changes Everything		2. Girls Just Want To Have Fun		3. When You Were Mine		4. Time After Time		5. She Bop		6. All Through The Night		7. Witness		8. The Goonies 'R' Good Enough		9. Change Of Heart		10. Boy Blue		11. True Colors		12. What's Going On		13. Iko Iko		14. The Faraway Nearby		15. Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)		16. I Drove All Night		17. Like A Cat		18. A Night To Remember		19. I Don't Want To Be Your Friend		Disc Two:		1. That's What I Think		2. Who Let In The Rain		3. Sally's Pigeons		4. A Part Hate		5. Hat Full Of Stars		6. Come On Home		7. Sisters Of Avalon		8. Ballad Of Cleo + Joe		9. You Don't Know		10. Fearless		11. Brimstone And Fire		12. Shine		13. Madonna Whore		14. This Kind Of Love		15. Waters Edge		16. I Miss My Baby		17. Stay		18. Makin' Whoopee (Duet With Tony Bennett)		19. You've Really Got A Hold On Me		They took 6 tracks from her debut, then they strangely take two from her second album, one from her third, two from her fourth, two from her fifth and none from her sixth! What?!! Sure it's nice to have Goonies, but no Hole In My Heart???!! Don't buy this, make your own compilation or wait until they get it right.
1,awful.  please stop making music.
1,I was disappointed in the music.  I had never heard some the songs on the album and most of these weren't very good.  I only recognized 5 of the songs.
1,My son likes this sone, I can't stand it or the video!  Wouldn't recommend to anyone...jthat is ust my opinion.
1,I mean, doesn't Savatage as a band name and members ONLY deserve the credit! Why does it have to be TSO under the spot lights and Savatage left in the dark? Is it fair?		Don't get me wrong but hey whats fair is fair, i mean i know Savatage members are still in TSO. But let's review; 1. Al petrilli left Savatage in the middle of Poets and Madmen album to join Megadeth then Dave Mustaine kicked him out, why take him back Paul O'neil?	2. Zak stevens (Sang only in Beethoven's last night) left Savatage to be with the family and surprisingly came back and made CIIC band and being rude enough to come ask Jon Oliva for his help! Come on!		Overall, I say since Savatage members are happy we should be happy that at least they got the attention they deserve even under TSO name.
1,Sigh, why did I buy this album? Yeah, like a sucker I brought this album thinking Jon still had his sparks from his past albums, but now realize I support a blatant thief of Black music. I listen through this album to not feel nothing syncing with melodies, the lyrics, and his vocals have charged. Well, I decided to deleted and no longer support this carbon copy knock off ever again!
1,dirty language
1,Barlow Girl is known for their rock harmonies. For Christmas songs from popular artists I'm looking for the sound of the artist and a fresh take on a classic. In this case, we get another classic sung by a band singing like they sing classics. There is nothing here that reminds of Barlow Girl or the kind of music that Barlow Girl fans would enjoy. There isn't anything new in this song. There isn't any reason to recommend it over any other version.		This song is not a Barlow Girl song, which is too bad.
1,Downloaded this as it was billed as free; did not disclose it was a time-limited file that wouldn't work after awhile.  I thought the music was great, at least what I heard of it before the file quit working.  This rating is not indicative of the group (I'll go buy an actual MP3 album later), just the fact that the limitations were not properly disclosed.
1,Disappointed this is the next single since it's not as good as Running on Heaven and also personally Black Stead are much better songs off the album! This is not gord!
1,I was expecting the song I heard on the radio, not this offensive, explicit version.  Uses "b..." word, etc...no thanks!  Deleted it.  Waste of money.  A singer who refers to women in such a derogatory manner is not an artist, and not worth listening to, imho.
1,The new Eric Clapton release isn't in the Top 100 here, but this dreadful waste of aluminum is? Something's WRONG here!		Sounds like vague attempt at metal via Metallica with a shot of Green Day and so on, but never gets past first base.		Not to worry, these folks will be forgotten in the near future.
1,Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
1,Not a traditional song done by The Flaming Lips? Got it free as a sampler when Amazon MP3 downloads was a section of the Amazon store. It's now called Digital Music.		The vocals are sub-par and so I can't recommend this tune.
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,Can someone explain to me why this crap gets played every day on the hour on radio stations? Especially rock stations that shouldn't be playing this anyway, it's not rock. Just another example of record companies paying stations to flog their music. It should be banned. What an irritating song.
1,Evil satanic garbage.
1,Poor quality
1,I know I know. I bought this under duress. Every time it plays I shudder to think that I actually spent money on this.
1,There is honestly a difference between being a singer, and being a manufactured product where the voice of the songstress slowly passes away, and the intimacy does not come from the heart. Tragically, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers who has been more of a product, than a actual artists that can move you. When it has came out to releasing a surprise album, it has been more like a joke than anyone who has a real sentiment for their voice. The songs that she has came out with, sound overall more pathetic than show a real sense of her voice. Her collaboration with Jay-Z also shows that she and him have no more chemistry in what they have done together. Drunk In Love, sounds more like drugged together in love. Beyonce' and Jay-Z do not ignite, no matter how much the song. They have done so many collaborations like Deja Vu and Crazy In Love, that they do not connect in music and song. It is honestly time for Beyonce' Knowles to just retire, and go away. This song is definitely not worth it, and Beyonce' is more drugged than talented.		Song: D-
1,HERE I AM!!! IS THE BEST THING ON HERE,also, if You Were My Man!!!.Everything else was wacc even that weak sample of "Silly".Shout's ta Lady Dee Dub,also checc out "Free",It's Gonna Take..., & That Family Ties Theme Song.
1,Steve decides too late that he needs an answer to Maiden member's solo projects and Bruce Dickinson's Skunkworks album, and so he goes from the Maiden "prog" to 90s alternative. The path to this is simple. Get "inspiration" from any numerous average bands pretending to be fresh floating around today, get an average typical sounding singer of today to sing the same post grunge meets Disney/r&b melodies. Write the average songs. Then spend many years polishing the average songs to try and play it as if it hasn't been done before. For the finishing touch, sprinkle a few of your trademarks on the top and put your household name on it.		On an interesting note, there's only two songs over 6 minutes, truly a feat, not easily accomplished, for Mr. Harris! The final song The Lesson is a well written song.		It's nice to see Harris do things out of the normal Maiden mold, but apparently he has no good ideas either inside or outside of Maiden. Given that reality, maybe the next bright step might be to write a biography.
1,Downright broken-hearted & depressing songs! There are two guitar jams, on this release! Not my cup o' java! Thanx!
1,I didn't screen the lyrics carefully enough before I bought it.  I like the reggae rhythm and the instrumentation is fairly good.  Wyclef Jean's vocals are good; Shakira's are a little week.  The lyrics are sexually suggestive, so I have to be careful not to play this song for younger audiences.
1,Not what I thought
1,no
1,ok
1,This song is trying way too hard to be the song of the summer. Maroon 5 is seriously shameless - at this point it's safe to say they'll do anything for chart success. Doesn't have the organic feel of some of their previous summer smashes like Moves Like Jagger or Payphone. They need a break, and we all need a break from Adam Levine.
1,I selected  this rating because I wanted to be fair. The music is off don't sound like the original beat. These are good song but the beat to these songs are off.	No; I would not recommend this to my friend.
1,Not the original
1,a song that gets played way too much on good ol FM radio loses it's luster
1,I was hoping for this music to sound like the Love is Blue which I had heard when I was younger but in this version the rhythm is wrong and whole thing just sounded "different".
1,It is so hard whenever someone who is talented, that unfortunately, they just haven't been able to sincerely to find their voices again, after their first record. For Meghan Trainor, her first album had some really good songs, but when it had came out to her second album, Thank You, I would have to say that I am very distraught that she has not really been able to drive her work further, where as the case with a lot of the songs like, No & I Love Me, I really was not hearing a stronger sound from Meghan that really drove her voice in her work. She really did throw people a hard hit, where her songs are not as strong in where she could've gone. Me Too, her latest single from Thank You, really doesn't deliver. She really delivered more of a sound that really showed she is a shell of herself. I was not very thrilled at how she had been delivering her work lately, and she delivered less in the drive of the song. Perhaps Meghan should not try and follow into Beyonce' or Rihanna territory. It really isn't Meghan suite at all.		Song: D
1,I downloaded the CD and still haven't been able to listen to the whole CD so I deleted it from my Library
1,Interesting song.
1,Chase Cut: This album was a huge disappointment...		Fine Print: After hearing the pop-punk influenced single "take me away", I had to have this CD. So I went out, bought it, and quickly tried to sell it back. It was total crap, boring as hell and quickly forgetable. This IS NOT pop-punk...its soul rock, and man does that ever blow!!!!		1. Stupid Little Love Song...Just that, STUPID. Sure the guitar and drums SOUND like something by SR-71 or Blink, but the music IS FAR FROM PUNK 2/10		2. Bye Bye Boyfriend...I have a softspot for this song, don't ask me why, but i do 5/10		3. Take me Away...The first single, and very deceptive. None of the album sounds ANYTHING like this 7/10		4. Everything...BORING!!!!1/10		5. Rock It Till You Drop It...My least favorite, and that says a whole hell of alot -100000/10		6. Revolution Song...No need to read the lyric sheet. Its the the words "Na Na Na" over and over again for 5 f**kin minutes straight 0/10		7. Kiss me fool...More crap. Stupid lyrics and forgetable music make this one a big ZERO/10		8. Unforgiven...Another softspot song. Its actually pretty catchy, and its about the only one i actually like while listening to the album 8/10		9. We went for a ride...the melody is okay, but the song is just so boring its not worth my time 2/10		10. Give it up...The lyrics are stupid as hell, but the music is okay 2/10		11. Julia...Yuck! This one Sucks a** 0/10		12. 8x10...This one gives me a headache, seriously. 1/10		13. Rainbow...Boring, but luckily it brings this terrible album to a close in less than 2 minutes...
1,IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE SONGS ARE STILL IN THE SYSTEM AND I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM AGAIN...I DID NOT RECEIVE ON MY IPOD.....
1,I loved "Intuition" when I heard it, and I'm not a big Jewel fan!  So, I was hoping for a welcome change from her normal folk music when I downloaded this.  Hate to say this, but this isn't really pop.  It's mostly folk with a rock edge.  Think Michelle Branch here with some Natalie Merchant and modern Madonna influences.  Really, "Intuition" is as pop as it gets and to me, it's really the only good song on this album!
1,hate it
1,I don't understand, how serious Yes fans can consider this 'Fly From Here' to be a REAL YES ALBUM.		Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as "DRAMA, Vol 2"...	... But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE.		... Hey, but... What can you REALLY expect when there's no more Jon Anderson and Rick (or even his so-talented son Adam) Wakeman, back in the full gang???	In addition, Trevor Horn has 'Buggles-ed' the music once again...		This 'Fly From Here', definitely, only has the cover art (another excellent work of the maestro Roger Dean) of a Yes album... The music, really performed by the band MAYBE... And ZERO stars.
1,I have not bought this cd but just from the sample songs i can tell they are not the original recordings. I'm from Philly i remember her 1st song Girls have feelings too (1964) followed by Are you ready her number #1 smash hit later on Sad sad girl etc....... These songs on this anthology c.d. have been rearranged and they SUCK!	  The  original songs could have been remastered through digital technology to enhance the vocal quality  (the back up crew especially the guys  singers were thorwing down accapella).  These remasterd back up singers are young inexperiend singers  who just ain't kicking it.	 Amazon does offer  the  original  "Are you ready Barbara Mason" colletion  .....but it's going for $199.00 and no m3p or ipod downlads are  availible
1,nothing special of course. just like her other songs it sucks as usual.	Isn't your 15 mins up by now?
1,Blegh
1,None
1,nice
1,It feels slightly weird reviewing a single song. Many times tracks make sense in the context of the entire album even if they do not work as a song. But as singles are now the prevelant form of digesting popular music these days, so it goes, I s'ppose.	Anywho, "Oh Love", the first single from Green Day's upcoming album "!Uno!" (to be followed by "!Dos!" and "!Tre!" in a succession of a few months) is the audio equivilant of mediocrity. There is no compelling hook to bring you back and the lyrics seem to have been written in about two and a half minutes with zero thought put into them. And the production is colorless, giving the already bland rocker a lack of flavor or style that should make the song popular for about a week on the radio but zero lasting value.	Following "21st Century Breakdown", a record that certainly didn't grow on me as the years passed, this is an even greater disappointment. I can't imagine anyone wanting to hear this song once or twice outside of a cursory listen to see what Green Day has been up to for the past few years.	You'd be better off saving your money and buying a Buzzcocks single or something. Even at a low price this is pretty much a rip off.
1,I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CAPS
1,i can not rate this as i never ordered it and can h=only hope that i didn't have to pay for it
1,Great song but sadly it won't play longer than about twenty seconds.  Most likely an issue with Amazon.
1,To think I sold my old cd to get the "better" sounding "remastered" version with extra tracks!  2 stars because even without the bonus tracks which in this case doesn't help the cd at all, this is actually quite a good album; I also got the cassette when this came out and quite frankly, even the cassette sounded better than this!		The sound quality is very, very poor so I'd recommend if you haven't already got this, to wait for another better remastered version or even get the original untouched cd if you can still find it as there is really no noticeable difference.  Perhaps if there is a well produced "Best of" compilation, that may be a good idea to get too especially to get "Do You Believe In Love" as well which I still think is their greatest hit ever.  I wonder if I can sell this cd too. Hmm......
1,NOT for children. Parents do NOT buy or let your children listen to this song. It has the c word in it MULTIPLE times...I have counted how many times but it is at least 20 to 40 times the c word is said in the song. Every time "peacock" is said she means the word without the "pea" in front of it. I repeat do NOT let your children listen to this! The song is about a woman who craves a man's private parts and is mesmerized by the size of it. DO NOT let your children listen to this! This song is in the movie Katy Perry Part of Me DO NOT let your children watch that movie! The C word is said multiple times since part of this song is in the movie! It has a fake PG review since the person who rated the movie clearly did not pay attention to the movie, the movie is actually rated R. And do NOT let your children watch R rated movies. Just really bad!
1,This is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said. The only place that has the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of 80s CD. It sounds a little thin to me but its the right version at least.
1,So glad there not popular anymore. The song is cheesy and way overrated in the 90's. Mmmbop shouldn't be a hit , its more like mmmsuck!
1,I WOULD review this but I didn't get it-it would NOT download from Amazon to my puter, altho other music from Amazon has. It wasn't worth wasting my time demanding a refund for 99 cents, so let's say I've learned NEVER to attempt to download any music from Amazon ever again! A waste of time and what little $$$ I have!
1,ITS BS Amazon forces you to download their software medial player in order to download the music you paid for. I don't want their media player. I will never buy music from Amazon again.
1,I just saw Motley Crue, Camden New Jersey 8/23/2014 so I knew when I got back to CA this CD was waiting for me in the mail. Personally as a rocker, not a country fan, except for Willie, Waylon and a few this CD was a big disappointment. I probably won't listen to it again. I just want to hear Motley Crue, not country covers, my mistake I should have known better.	Sound quality is good and well mixed with this stereo only (right-left-sub) CD. Packaging is not that good as the disc comes out of the center fold and is hard to handle especially while driving.	If you are an admitted country fan and a closet rocker you will love it, but a pure rocker and a Motley fan, not so much.
1,Nothing good worth mentioning but "Picture Perfect"!!!.That tracc with BRANDY was o.k an "Dumb S**t should've been without Snoop an Blacc Ty.
1,I liked it beacuse it was christmas cd but I didn't like it becuse it hade less tracks unstead of a full cd for free.
1,It was ok.
1,This Carol also has crescendo.  It's a great Carol classic.  Now I can hear it even when the radio isn't playing it!
1,After his first solo album ... the superb " Stranger In This Town" ... I was firmly convinced that Sambora was the creatively superior one in the Bon Jovi / Sambora writing team ... now in 2012, I'm not so sure ...		Sambora's 2nd, and this, his 3rd solo record are quite forgettable ( as are all of Bon Jovi's albums since "Crush" , except for maybe "Lost Highway" )... in my opinion, that could be attributed to the idea that he has lost sight of the type of songs & sound that made his 1st solo record so good ...quality songwriting, catchy riffs, solid vocals & harmonies, and NOT over produced ...		One can only hope that at some point going forward Sambora recaptures the formula that he had when he did his best work ... but few artists ever do, because it is my feeling that an artist has only a certain number of good / great songs in them.		But I'll take mediocre Sambora music over just about anything else being released these days ...
1,Downloads ask for last disk.  Unworkable.
1,Boring. Boring. Even more Boring.  All the songs sound exactly the same.  I don't know what he was thinking with this one, but this one stinks.  The whole 70's vibe is so out of place and sounds dated and tired.  There isn't even one stand out track on this one, it sounds like one slow boring song...the kind that you would change the radio station 10 seconds in. I have liked mostly all of John's albums...but this one is even more boring than all his past efforts.  You should pick this one up if you like to listen to the same song for 55 min, then it may be an enjoyable ride for you. If you like an album to have ups and downs and twists and turns than this is not for you...skip it.  If you like this sound...there is a band that does it 100% better called "Mother Hips" and the lead singer of that band has a couple of solo albums that are very good too his name is Tim Bluhm check them out instead.
1,I rely did not like the way that he sings this song. He did not seem to have enough power in his voice to sing it. I think the best person I have heard sing this song is Clay Aiken.
