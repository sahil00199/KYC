0,Great stuff. Been using it to cure the beef jerky.
0,My kids love this cereal as they really like this sweet honey nut taste combine with the whole grain flavor. In fact, they love this cereal so much we typically go through 2 to 3 boxes per month. The best part of them liking this cereal is that's it a whole-grain meaning they are eating something nutritious.		Recommend.
0,No bad stuff in it, and it tastes really good!  I keep these in my glovebox, purse, and my husband's lunchbox!
0,Perfect! Spread a little on some good crispbread, add your topping of choice (mine is sliced Fuji apple with a dusting of Ksalt and black pepper) and enjoy. Fast shipping, thanks!
0,This was a new spice for me to try.  It was called for in one of my recipes. Since my children and I all have the same cookbook (The Jerusalem Cookbook) I shared this spice with my two children.  We have all loved the results.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.
0,This has such a pronounced smoke flavor compared to the Maldon. Might be a bit strong to use as a finishing salt, but its a much better salt for cooking. This and a little smoked paprika make steaks taste great. Really enjoying this product.
0,awesome
0,I received a gift box of Viva Lab products from a buddy who's a BIG fan of their products and thought I needed to try them- bless her, I can see why.  I am SO impressed with the quality all round, I must post reviews for everything but in the interest of time I'll combine them:		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MCT-OIL-32-Ounces/dp/B00MGW5UVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MCT OIL, 32-Ounces</a>:  First time I'd tried, or even heard of it.  I'm a convert!  a noticeable improvement in how I feel, my energy level.  While some say it's not for frying, I use it for sauteing, frying things at a lower temperature- yummy.  Also use it in place of olive oil or butter to make garlic and dipping bread, and grilled cheese sandwiches.  Taste it- it tastes GREAT.  I subsequently tried another brand and it had a slightly bitter whang- this is pure, light and lovely.  No more nasty canola oil for me (and for fried foods that require higher temperatures I'm using refined coconut oil).		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ORGANIC-CHIA-SEEDS-2-LBS/dp/B00OZYNGUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ORGANIC CHIA SEEDS- 2 LBS</a>- Gosh, so many uses for these seeds- I love them anywhere sesame seeds are normally used (e.g., sprinkled on grilled cheese sandwiches before browning, in salads, on deviled eggs, a zillion uses).  My birds love them too.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ORGANIC-RAW-CACAO-NIBS-1-lb/dp/B00MGW81YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ORGANIC RAW CACAO NIBS, 1 lb</a>- These remind me of coffee beans, the kind you buy dusted with cocoa, but these aren't sweetened so I tried them rolled in coconut sugar and mixed into a kind of brittle I made with yacon syrup.  Great that way, plan to experiment more to find uses that complement their delicate flavor.  LOVE the crunch.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ORGANIC-CACAO-POWDER-FROM-CRIOLLO-BEANS-2lb-Bag/dp/B00P6TUO5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ORGANIC CACAO POWDER FROM CRIOLLO BEANS, 2lb Bag</a>- this makes the BEST mocha espressos, indistinguishable from Starbucks' at a fraction of the price.  I use a tablespoon of cacao powder to two tablespoons of espresso (for a jumbo cup- 16 oz).  The best cocoa I've had, I use it instead of Hershey's now.  I also make fabulous chocolate pudding, brownies, EVERYTHING chocolate with it.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PREMIUM-HIMALAYAN-ORGANIC-GOJI-BERRIES-1lb-bag/dp/B00PWW3LQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PREMIUM HIMALAYAN ORGANIC GOJI BERRIES, 1lb bag</a>&nbsp;- Tough to tell what makes one feel better and more energetic without being systematic about it.  I try to be, but I couldn't resist tearing into this gift box, like Christmas.  I munch away on these, a small handful a day, at the same time I use the MCT oil (and everything else).  All I know is I feel great.  They're sweeter than cranberries, taste a bit like raspberries- yummy.  Mix into salads too.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ORGANIC-QUINOA-100-Royal-Bolivian-Whole-Grain-4-LB-Bag/dp/B00JPJRQ7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ORGANIC QUINOA, 100% Royal Bolivian Whole Grain, 4 LB Bag</a>- I moved from another state where I shopped at Raley's.  There was a brand of quinoa sold by them that was great, but not available in Southern California.  Subsequent brands I tried were either tasteless, puny or bitter.  This quinoa is just as good, if not better- no rinsing needed- fluffy, nutty tasting, wonderful.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/HIGH-POTENCY-VITAMIN-D3-5000-IU-360-Softgels/dp/B00FQKI3W6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HIGH POTENCY VITAMIN D3, 5000 IU, 360 Softgels</a>: I take two daily and feel good, what can I say?  Tiny, easy to swallow, with no burping/aftertaste.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TRIPLE-STRENGTH-GLUCOSAMINE-CHONDROITIN-AND-MSM-240-Capsules/dp/B00STSUPCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TRIPLE STRENGTH GLUCOSAMINE, CHONDROITIN AND MSM, 240 Capsules</a>&nbsp;- This glucosamine-chondroitin-MSM combo is the first I've tried.  I've lately been getting aches and pains, especially after overexerting myself.  This not only assuages the pain but I swear boosts my muscle strength and overall stamina.  I take two in the morning and two at night.  I also have a knee that inexplicably goes out every week or two and thats a rarity now.  Fantastic.		There isn't a single item here I plan to be without, so when I run out I'll be re-ordering- plan to try other Viva Labs products as well.  The quality of everything is absolutely superb.  Highest recommendation!
0,this is enough for 1 year.
0,Arrived as advertised, arrived on time, great product for the price.
0,All of the Indomie selections should be rated high on any scale. If people only knew the difference of quality and how any selection of  Indomie noodles can make a meal all on its on accord, with or without other ingredients such as meat or vegetables, they would never go back to the brands offered on a grocery shelf.		This product is so versatile that it could become an important ingredient in many types of recipes, such as a salad dish, or possibly a casserole; it just takes a little imagination to use Indomie noodles in various dishes!  And again, they are tasty and satisfying all on their own.
0,Another great Subscribe&Save item!  Great flavors.  Sweet but not overly so.
0,Nice and sweet - no need to add any sweetener.  Creamy flavor. Not strong, but with the flavor, you don't really miss that.
0,I'm sure you have heard of Sriracha by now, it has become a staple. It's great on Chinese food, Thai food, and even Mexican food sometimes (although often for Mexican food I would prefer another pepper hotsauce). I went through a phase in my life where I put this on almost everything. Can't go wrong with adding some sriracha.
0,Fairly expensive, but oh so good!
0,This tea is awesome at soothing a sore or gassy stomach. Great mix of lemon and ginger; I prefer to others I've tried.
0,I bought this because it was vegan and I needed something for quick lunches at work sometimes.  This is tasty, but does not taste like Pad Thai.  I followed the directions for preparing it (just add water and heat) It was too hot to eat right then,  so I covered it and let it rest for 5-6 minutes and it was thick and noodly (not sure that's a word).  The sauce was okay, and it was rather filling.  If you want the true Pad Thai taste,  don't buy this.  But it is tasty and I like the flavor, so it is good enough that I will buy it again.  I also bought the McDougall's vegan Tortilla Soup, but havn't tried it yet -- will post review on it after I try it.
0,very good
0,I LOVE this popcorn.  There are hardly any hulls and I like the very small kernels it pops into. Delicious!
0,If you aren't used to Greek coffee this has a different taste than regular US coffee. It isn't bad, just different. My husband drinks a cup everyday.
0,Enjoyed the variety and unsalted taste.
0,My son is really picky and loves this milk, same as me! A total success! :)
0,I buy french roasts quite often on Amazon. I've tried many different brands but this is the first one that stood out. Unusally smooth with a fairly rich flavour yet one might call it somewhat mild for a french roast.		I think I've finally found a coffee I'll stick with.
0,This is a very good product...I love it....dont purchase if you don't like the heat
0,Used these at a 50th anniversary party, packaging is a nice gold color, and they tasted fresh.
0,Good concentrated tamarind, great for cooking.
0,OK brew. My coffemaker does not do it justice, as it leaves a slightly bitter flavor, probaby not due to the cups, but to my cheap coffemaker.
0,OK
0,Wow. Its a really good assortment of coffee, the office loves it. Really is something for everyone! Will get more!
0,Our family loves the baked bbq lays and can't get enough! Since I count my calories for dieting, I'm also pleased that these hold only 120 calories per serving.
0,This tea is smooth and tasty with sweetener and milk and I like the higher caffeine. Coffee is a little harsh for me, although I love it, but I drink two or more 16 oz mugs a day.  Drinking the same amount of this tea daily is is easier on my stomach, no acid reflux issues with it. I just feel better for some unknown reason. Maybe having no heartburn is the reason why I think my mood improves with a cup of this tea.
0,As always....... you can't beat Tones...... I have always enjoyed excellent quality from this brand.......
0,Not bad. I like most of what this brand puts out and these cutlets were no exception. The gravy could be better.
0,as advertised
0,Love these!
0,good sugar
0,Amazing delivery. It is quality juice. Pricing is average compared to other juice fast systems. If you are a health freak the only downside is that the jucies are a little bit still too sweet. I prefer less sweet and more bitter for a better detox. This is like for beginner juice-fasts.
0,I originally bought these to use as a sugar substitute in my baking...but after one bite...i was hooked. I could sit and eat them all. LOL They are so yummy. I will for sure be purchasing them often for baking AND eating:o)	They also arrived VERY quickly and well packaged. Very please with the purchase and look forward to getting more in the future!
0,It is grilling season again and my wife and I love to cook on the grill.  McCormicks has become a part of our normal seasoning that we use on the various cuts of meat that we cook out.  It is a good seasoning to add into hamburgers and we even use it sprinkled on some steaks or mixed into meatballs and meatloaf.  The seasoning adds in a hint of chili pepper, onion and garlic.  The seasoning does contain a lot of salt so we do not over season or add in any additional salt into the meat.  We also sprinkle it onto pork, ribs and chicken.		This is a good product and we like it a lot.  We rated it at 5 stars.
0,Fresh and tasty. A great value- we had more than enough for our candy bar. Kids and adults loved them!
0,Great for Central European cooking
0,I like Native Forest because there is no BPA in the can's lining.  I also like that the coconut milk is not overly processed and is creamy and has consistent quality.  I buy this by the case.  It's great for smoothies, substituting the liquid in a recipe like pancakes from milk to coconut milk.  Healthy fat and rich flavor.		Tip:  Shake the can hard before opening it to distribute the thick coconut milk that clings to the lid.
0,This monster jar will last for quite a while.	Perhaps an acquired taste, but for those who know, there's nothing quite like Marmite on hot buttered toast.
0,Fire for your mouth and your butt. It so hot you question why you even eat it but then again it is sooo good.
0,Great seeds to use in smoothies.
0,Works well
0,Delicious
0,As advertised.
0,These are always good to have around the house and it is a great way to make a change from the regular snacks. Very much enjoyed. The price is incredible.
0,Great snack to keep in for the car. No added sugar so that's great!
0,great tasting K cup
0,Primal Kitchen offers a quality product. The ceasar does lack a strong flavor if that is what you are looking for.
0,I use this when I am making bread products and since I know that you will get a quality product with Hain I knew that this would work for my low salt and low fat diet and it works wonderful as baking powder without the salt.
0,These Dole Fancy Pineapple Tidbits in Water 4 ounce pack (pack of 4) have a balanced level of sweetness and ample juice texture to the pineapples. I also like that the juice that comes with the pineapples also is drinkable in the way that someone can drink their favorite juice out of the fridge.
0,like
0,Great accent to my cupcakes and the kids loved them.
0,This is the only k-cup I use. I think the flavor is just right - however, I add creamer and sweetener to ALL coffee. I'm a total "coffee-wimp", but really enjoy it that way. If you like a little flavoring, not too bold - you'll probably like this one.
0,I like the salted better but my Dr. said...
0,I love this stuff.  The spices in all five flavors really appealed to me, it was nice and chewy but not tough....perfect jerky.		I don't understand the reviews that indicated "gelatinous" consistency or a weird coating.  I had nothing even close to that in any of the 5 packages.		I'm definitely ordering again.
0,I really love this tea. I should start out and say that I, like most, kind of secretly expected this tea to taste like maybe hot chocolate or to have a real chocolate taste. It does not. It tastes like tea with some spices is all. It has maybe a hint of cocoa, but it's not the full on chocolate taste people are going to expect. So keep this in mind before sipping, or you'll get a little disappointed. It's a really mild tea, no bitterness at all, and it has a great scent and flavor. It even wakes me up and gives me a bit of energy in the morning. I took off one star because of the price, I wish it were a little cheaper. Overall I recommend anyone try this.
0,My favorite flavor!! Dark chocolate almond mint! Can't find these in stores anywhere!!
0,very tasty and great will purchase
0,Are you sure they are gluten free?!!!! Wonderful
0,I enjoy mixing up the taste of coffee, and this pack of creamers has six different favors. I hope it gets back in stock shortly, because I plan to buy more. Great product.
0,Nice variety and they all taste great!  Will definitely buy again.
0,love this!
0,I used to buy another brand but tried this one when the other companys production ceased for a while. I love this brand and it is always readily available.
0,Good price, fast delivery.
0,I am a noodle lover. These are great tasting and fast and easy to prepare. I recommend especially on a cold day.
0,Excellent
0,thanks
0,My very favorite----best ever !!!
0,This is a good tasting, healthy, and reasonably priced product. Usually granola bars are too dry or crunchy, and taste WAY too healthy. This product tastes great, just enough sugar, and doesnt taste too dry. No real complaints besides the fact its in a square, its trivial but i prefer long bars.
0,timely delivery of a standard product, well pacjkged, fairly priced: not much more to say if you know lindt chocoaltes brand name.  if you do not, a high end commercial-non-boutique chocolatier in switzerland, do not undersetimate belgian chocolates
0,good price on time delivery
0,Love it!! SERIOUSLY FRESH!!
0,If you are a fan of instant oats you'll love this brand. I happen to like several flavors from this company but this one is my favorite. The apple cinnamon flavor is sweet and not artificial tasting.  The oats have good texture - not gluey or gummy. Super convenient, efficiently packaged - comes in a *really* small box. No JUNK in the ingredient list either!		I agree with other reviews that it's best to compare prices - for some reason there seems to be a very wide swing on this one.		Overall, a quick and easy way to start the day with something good tasting and good for you too. Pleased to recommend.
0,I am addicted to these damn things.  I eat a whole can, then end up the bathroom 3x the next day.
0,Reminds me of the taste of the muscle milk protein drink, but maybe a little bit better.
0,These are addictive for all ages. If you like gummies, these are for you!
0,Great tasting coffee, rich and full bodied with just a slight hint of coconut. I plan to purchase again.
0,GREAT
0,Very good, Never before used before but glad I got introduced to it. It is different than the local honey I get so I decided to try it.
0,Great Christmas fun for the kids to open
0,I've traveled all over Italy and there are two things that are difficult to replicate in America, gelato and great pizza. In America we tend to put too many ingredients on our pizza - we go for quantity instead of quality. For authentic Italian piazza, keep things simple and use the best ingredients. Antimo Caputo "00" flour is Italian pizza flour. It is what they use in Naples (where pizza was invented). I am never without this flour in my pantry. Don't forget, you can make dough in advance and store in the freezer for several months.
0,Work great for bath bombs. Shiploed fast. Great quality.
0,I am very picky with coffee. I really dislike the super strong blends that leave a nasty aftertaste, are bitter, and require lots of cream to stomach. According to a recent Starbucks survey 40% of Americans actually don't like the super strong bold type coffee - well count me as part of that 40%. I like a mild to medium blend with a nice flavor without any bitterness.		I've tried MANY of the mild or medium roast blends. Until I found Caribou Coffee I thought there was nothing out there for me - and I did all sorts of things just to have a cup of joe to enjoy (mixing hot water in, adding flavored creamers, and so on). I alternate this coffee with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Caribou-Coffee-Daybreak-Morning-Blend-Ground-12-Ounce-Bags-Pack-of-2/dp/B002O62ASS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Caribou Coffee Daybreak Morning Blend Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>. Both are outstanding. I've bought bag after bag of this and it's always the same great coffee. Not the cheapest coffee - but for me absolutely worth the price. No need for any flavored creamers - this one has fantastic flavor on its own!
0,A classic!
0,These are perfect - wish they came in whole wheat, non-salted. . . . Oh, who am I kidding?
0,This was a gift for my son. It was waiting for him when he got home from work!
0,This is my 2nd purchase of this brand of xylitol.  I like that it comes from birch.  I wish it was certified organic, but this is not as much of a concern with birch as opposed to GMO/Roundup Ready sources, such as corn.  It has a sweet taste that is very similar to sugar (I hate the Saccarin aftertaste of many other sweeteners).  It does have a menthol cooling effect, which seems to work as a bonus when I make herbal tea or lemonaid.  I haven't really noticed any digestive issues.  Probably my 2nd favorite is Erytheritol (sp?), but it is not quite as sweet (80%) as much as xylitol.  Inulen wasn't sweet at all (maybe 10% sweet) and seemed very similar to powdered creamer.  Monk Fruit (I used the light weight flakes/granules) was pretty sweet (maybe 80%), but had a very slight artificial sweetener type aftertaste (not too bad, though).  For the Keto folks, I plan to do some glucose blood testing with xylitol to see how much it affects my blood sugar - I read that it affects BS differently for different people.  Will report back if I remember, but people should do their own after they water fast for a few days.
0,I bought this for my son's Christmas stocking and he loves it. He cooks with it all the time. He does love spicy food!
0,I love the mild taste of this excellent organic Darjeeling tea. You can really taste the quality. It is never bitter. I drink it for breakfast ans after lunch, with soya milk and sometimes organic honey. I always buy it from Amazon as we live in a very small town where it is difficult to find gourmet groceries.
0,I wish KIND bars weren't so expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for:	Simple ingredients, good flavors, better nutrition. I like the way these bars satisfy and nourish.
0,good product and good taste. My wife's favorite flavor.
0,Love planters peanuts
0,Wow - I am totally addicted to these.  In my opinion, they BBQ flavoring is really good and these are very crunchy.  It does not taste like these should be healthy for you.  I would rather eat these BBQ chips than any other chips and I love all kinds of chips.  I have now switch over to POPCHIPS as I know I am eating a better chip and its healther too.  For 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat, I feel it is a good choice and the taste makes it worth wild.  I have taken some of these to work and have gotten some co-workers hooked on these as well.
0,I have a Tiger Mochi Machine and this rice works wonderfully in it. Even if you are cooking this rice in a regular steamer, you need to soak the rice overnight in plenty of water first. Drain the water out of the soaked rice and then STEAM the rice. The result is a lovely, sweet and slightly sticky rice. If you have leftover rice, you can form it into patties and fry it like a pancake. If you try to cook sweet rice like any other rice, the results are too gluey.
0,It is OK
0,I got these when they were on sale through amazon. I was hesitant because I normally only eat protein bars, but I couldn't pass up the price. I almost cancelled the order but please let me tell you when im glad that I didnt. THESE ARE AMAZING! I feel like they are super addicting and yummy. I think ive already between me and two other people in a shot time frame eaten three boxes already. They are so delicious. I love the fact that theres flax seed in it. You would never know its a healthier option, it tastes like pumpkin spice. Its like having fall all year round, and it is fantastic. Once my boxes run out, Im buying more even though they aren't on sale.
0,Just what I wanted!
0,So good!!! I've bought three orders and my fianc&eacute; loves them too.  He does landscaping and assures me that they give him energy!!!	I just love the crunch and the taste! It keeps me full until I can get a good meal in me.
0,If you like salmon--this ready to eat meal is absolutely my favorite.	It is so good, I changed my order from once a month to twice a month---and I live by myself.		I am also proud to serve this to friends who drop by--they all love it.
0,Love Beans,  Use these for bean soup or ham and beans.  Good quality
0,Crunchy and tasty, but you have to like pepper
0,Pretty good!
0,I always wondered if using a ready good vinegar would make a big difference in salads.  Answer: yes! this produce is worth the money and a little goes a long ways.
0,Amazing. Have ordered multiple times. One of my favorite teas. Tastes like red hots, but really soothing, especially on a cold day.
0,tasty when ground up to better digest
0,A great product,and better than the store-bought varieties.(I tasted 3 other bottles I had at home,and compared them,and just threw the others away) I use this spice constantly now with many dishes,typically using 1-2 tsps.,and then adding 1/2 tsp of the La Chinata Hot Paprika for a little heat.
0,Tried peach and though it was great but then I got a little tired of it. It's good but the apple one to me is a better *everyday* substitute for soda. The peach flavor is good some times.
0,These unsalted top crackers are delicious.		This is my second purchase. Highly recommend these for those who have blood pressure issues or, as in my case, heart problems.		Be careful where you purchase these. Some vendors here on Amazon are charging twice the price for this product. The price here from Amazon is perfect!
0,I use this as my everyday flour from biscuits to bread. Although I'm still working on getting the bread consistency right it keeps falling.
0,GREAT
0,I have been using sugar free syrups for a variety of purposes, but currently I use them to flavor Club soda for tasty and sugar free drinks. I also use them in coffee of course, and in lo-cal milk shakes. I am learning that Splenda is also not a particularly healthy sugar substitute so I try not to use too much of it. I am trying this one out as a substitute for the gingerbread flavor which I like very much.
0,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!  All the flavors are great.  Even Mango.  I hate mangos but the mango pops are yummy!  My kid likes them, too.  He said, "These are even tastier than the unhealthy ones!"  I agree!  VERY tasty - full flavors - and no guilt!  Home Run!
0,This is good but not the same as I had at a great little restaurant in Hawaii.  I had a side that was called coconut rice and they said it was syrup.  Purchased this hoping I could get close to authentic but not so.  Probably all the fresh fruits from Hawaii~~
0,Love this spelt flour. Use as a substitute for white wheat flour. Works great for people with gluten sensitivities. Great service from Amazon. Great product.
0,This is a good product. They do not taste as good as tostitos, but they are healthier (supposedly).
0,Great healthy snack
0,I love this "Manuka Honey Blend".  It has a wonderful taste when added to any flavor of tea.	I will definitely purchase this product again.
0,For the price I think the cocoa cups are very good. I will order them again. They are nice to have in the house for the grand children and the holidays
0,I like the big tubs for on my shop counter, customers love Twizzlers! we have not had a bad batch always fresh and chewy
0,Even more delicious than beef stew. What's more important is, it contains low calory, which means that you save time and lose weight simultaneously if you buy this.
0,I have had other brands, but this one is the best for flavor, quality and price. I use it as an alternative for bread. I fill it with tuna, uncured cold cuts, scrambled eggs...
0,Pretty good, but slightly flimsy. Still does the trick.
0,Traditional sesame snack taste with a sharp cheddar powder coating. I love them! However if you prefer a mild cheddar flavor these may be a bit sharp for your liking.
0,these are actually alright ,although i hope i didn't just play into some kind of Chester Cheeta scam this tastes gud and is bulk with PROTIENs
0,Works just fine
0,Even though it was stated as light roast it was lighter than I had expected.  I have been using more beans than normal and the flavor is quite pleasant.  My friends enjoy it as they think my coffee is generally too strong!
0,Good box treat for binge TV watching.
0,Gag gift for my brother.  He loved it!
0,Love it ,will buy again
0,love this tea
0,Enjoyed this assortment, will not buy again, but will buy all except the decaffeinated and bold.  Vendor was easy to order from and will use again.
0,I love this potato salad. The potatoes are cooked just right. The celery is crunchy. It all comes together wonderfully.
0,great
0,I choose Glucerna because it is gluten free and lactose free, and none of its competitors are.  It is tasty and very filling.  I know I am using something healthy and approved of by my doctor.
0,Perfect for popcorn! We eat this mixed with a little butter on our popcorn OMG so good!
0,I no longer use it because I'm trying to train myself not to need any sweetener.  But I used to use it all the time, and I loved it.  It tastes and looks and works in cooking just like table sugar.  It isn't a  non calorie sweetener, but it isn't fructose, so it won't burn up your liver, and it isn't sugar, so it won't spike your insulin.  I have no idea if it is in any way unhealthy.
0,Tasty, good variety, price was right
0,These are great.
0,Glad I bought these!
0,My favourite flavour, flavour is spelled the British way !!!
0,The best flavor & price
0,GREAT  TO EAT
0,Fresh and Delicious
0,Was a great item to reward workers with
0,Delish! Chocolatey goodness
0,I bought the 6 pak to try out. We liked it, it has a good flavor, but we thought it was a bit salty. Next time, I will probably use half of the salt mixture. I also added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to season 3 mix packets for 3 pounds of beef. The heat was just right for us - not too hot but a bit of zing to it. Very tasty - would recommend to others.
0,Go Raw makes great stuff....keep these in the fridge for a cool, crunchy pop! Best ingredient list...simple, pure, raw, and delicious!
0,Brilliant
0,I have been using Zone perfect bars in other flavors. The double dark chocolate is a really nice flavor it is not too sweet and is semi-bitter. Really liking the flavor. Got a great deal on the price from Amazon.
0,A nice once in a while treat for the kids (and one the older kids can make themselves.)  But even better - when a working mom needs a quick and easy dish to pass for the block party, jello jigglers are a huge hit with neighborhood kids.  Other parents may spend a lot more time making fancy dishes, but the kids will run right to the jigglers.  (Keep for a special treat and when you have plenty of time and space to let them run off the sugar high!)
0,THE CHILDREN IN MY BUILDING LOVE THE EARLY GIFT OF GUM BY ME. THEY LOVE IT AND THEY CAN SAY THEY GOT A PIECE OF AMERICAN GUM TO CLASSMATES. THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT.
0,Great price for a whole case of these tea bags, drink them in the afternoons at my desk at work.  Packaging arrived quickly and in good shape.
0,I am very sensitive to msg. When i found out these eliminated that ingredient, i was ecstatic to try them. They taste great. And great product for very cheap
0,came well packaged and very delicious but price a little high thus the 4 star otherwise a wonderful product for hot cocoa
0,Tinkyada makes the best gluten-free pasta I have tasted, and I like the fusilli the best.  They are not at all gritty or mushy, like many gluten-free pastas tend to be.  This pasta is best if you cook it using the "energy-saving method" described on the front of the package, and I only cook it for 3/4 of the time listed (15 minutes).  This way, you get a truly al dente pasta -- and you won't even miss the wheat!
0,Excellent
0,I love these chocolates a lot.  I order these several bags at a time, the bad thing is that they are seasonal and I can't always find them.  They are so good, they are white choc. with peppermint sprinkles in the shell and a white chocolate creamy in the middle
0,I love this cereal, but it can be a bit pricey, so I add Raisin Bran to it to make it more economical. Love the raisins, dates and pecans!
0,yummy
0,Not wimpy. Strong horseradish. My favorite
0,I buy this regularly.  My grandson really likes them.
0,I love, love this matcha tea.  The taste is yummy.
0,Flavorful, spice, tasty cheese, melts well for grilled cheese sandwiches.
0,Excellent price and I love the subscribe and save option. One of my favorite coconut oils. Nice clean taste. Thanks
0,I love these cookies anytime of the day. And when I just don't want to cook breakfast they are awesome with a cup of tea.
0,I love this fondant. No flaws for me, and I keep buying it. The taste is so much better than Wilton.
0,Amazon gave a good price for the large size.  This is my go to for things I've left unseasoned for my husband.  When it is just too bland, I reach for the Krazy Salt.  It does contain sodium, so please be aware of that if you are intending to stay on a low sodium diet.
0,I couldn't find sugar free in my local grocery stores.  THis a great deal and so glad to be able to get it.  Makes good diabetic desserts.
0,Great for cooking without that burnt butter taste or for taking with cod liver oil.
0,Great Price!!
0,I am loving this balsamic vinegar. Mine is the raspberry infused. So far, I have mainly used it to make an olive oil and vinegar salad dressing for a Caprese salad and also for a tossed green salad. I also used it for a dip for bread. And I also tried in my spaghetti with shrimp recipe. I was initially concerned that the infused vinegar would not be as versatile as the plain balsamic vinegar. To some extent that can be true, but so far it has worked well for everything I have used it for.		The flavor is sweet almost like a syrup. However, I tend to just use a little so it is not overwhelming.  The raspberry flavor is strong when I taste the vinegar directly, but it is more subtle used as an ingredient.		It is a nice and thick balsamic vinegar. I used it in a recipe that called for a balsamic vinegar reduction sauce and I used it straight without adding sugar and it worked just fine. I noticed with other thicker balsamic vinegars that I tend to pick up hints of raspberry. It is interesting to taste one that it is actually raspberry infused. I think this might actually taste good on fresh fruit or even ice cream. I haven't tried it yet, but the slightly syrupy texture tempts me. However, I have only used it in savory dishes.		I received a free sample to review, all opinions and experiences described are my own.
0,I believe this is the best selling tea in the UK, and I have friends from there who continue to depend upon it.  Good taste and strength.  Quite economical, as I judge it.  I usually prepare it for breakfast in a tea pot with a metal mesh infuser as the tea is rather finely "ground."
0,It was a great price for an expensive item.
0,Southeastern Mills Gravy Mix -- whichever flavor you use -- is great gravy! Unlike most packets you get at the grocery that make one cup of gravy, this makes 3 1/2 cups. (So do their brown and peppered gravies.) What family only uses one cup of gravy? Not any family with southern or midwestern roots, I can tell you that. With Southeastern Mills, there is enough for the whole family and maybe a little left over for the cat or dog. (Maybe not.) Follow the directions on the packet and you will have smooth and tasty gravy every time. This is good gravy for chicken fried steak or breaded, boneless chicken breasts or, if you toss some browned and crumbled country sausage and a little pepper in it and cook the whole thing in the skillet you browned the sausage in, it is lip smackin' good on biscuits fresh out of the oven.
0,Main stay in my pantry
0,I've used this sugar for my coffee at home and was pleased to get these packets for work. The taste is "warmer" than standard white sugar. The packets are a good price, too.
0,Though I generally review entertainment products on Amazon I do occasionally review food products and, in advance for the huge Summer Fancy Food Show which I will attend next month in New York, the company sent me samples of some of their new products. This was the first  one I tried, and I really like it. I do have a small issue with the package size though.		This variety of their freeze-dried fruit contains Strawberries, Bananas, Apples and Blueberries (in that order). There is nothing else. No sugar, no preservatives, nothing. If youve have cereals (like Special K) which have died fruit in them, you will know the texture. Yes, they are (obviously) dry. But you can add these to cereals or other things with liquids and they will sort-of reconstitute. The bananas are not really crisp like the dried bananas you get in health food stores, but those have added sugar and preservatives.		As noted by another reviewer, these are great for those with allergies to additives.		The package prominently states there are only 40 calories per serving but a service is 1/3 cup and there are 3.5 servings in a bag. (so its not a big serving). Then again, if you devour the whole 1.2 oz bag, youve only taken in 150 calories and gotten 7 g of fiver and no fat.		The name crispies is a bit confusing as these pieces (especially the apple slices) have no crunch. When eaten from the bag.		So, yes, these are basically guilt free and very tasty but they only come in the 1.2 oz bags. While these are great for snacking, I would think that a package that was larger, would cut the fixed cost of packing down a lot and make these treats more affordably priced, especially for those who need unadulterated fruits. May the company will consider this.		Meanwhile, I can recommend that you do try them. And see what you think.		Ill be trying  their other products and will post my reviews here		I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.		Steve Ramm	Anything Phonographic
0,Very enjoyable salad dressing.  It is a go to favorite in my house.
0,We got these for our god-daughter in college and she and her friends enjoyed them!  The assorted fruit flavors are a treat!
0,Husband very happy!!!! Said these are fantastic.
0,Always order this product and love it.  Will order again.  Yummy and easy to fix.  Wish they had gluten free, though.
0,One of my favorite breakfast meals.  Easy to prepare and delicious.
0,Walnuts are my favorite nuts, so I was happy to try these, but for some reason even though I did see the word Chopped in the name, I did not realize that the pieces are so small. It has a nice fresh taste and good for baking, but for me pieces are too small to grab with me to work for snacking throughout the day.
0,Great for a quick snack or those "Oops, I didn't have time to do breakfast this morning" days.	Perfect mix of not-to-sweet dark chocolate, offset with the sea salt, and good hearty crunch without chewy fruit pieces getting stuck in your teeth.
0,Yummy! I purchased these as an addition to my daughter's candy and cake buffet.  They were fresh and tasty.
0,I am very satisfied with the product.  I usually use it on popcorn instead of butter.
0,Exactly the same flavor as in the legit bubble tea houses and Thai restaurants.
0,Season salt with a hint of herbs.  Tastes great with neat dishes... But careful on vegetable.  Not everyone will like it.
0,Full of flavor and not loaded with a ton of sugar like other brands.	I take the variety pack with me when I travel.	also great over vanilla ice cream
0,Cheddar pasta and vegies a tasty fast meal
0,This product is very healthy for you I will recommend it to everyone
0,This is one giant can of cheese!  I don't know why this surprised me, but it did.  It's HUGE!  It would be perfect for an extremely large family, a party, or for a cafeteria.  But for our family size of four I found it easy enough to spoon into baggies for storing in the freezer for future use.  Our family is big on cheese though so I imagine it won't be all that long until the cheese is eaten up.  That being said, this is really a bargain.  An excellent price for such a large can (it resembles a can of paint in my opinion).  The taste can't be beat.  It's absolutely delicious!  We have so far used it on chips and macaroni and cheese.  It could be used in so many other recipes, or drizzled over vegetables too.
0,too many stems. I think they make the mate harsher on your throat
0,I usually use ceremonial green tea matcha powder but I wanted something that would dissolve in a water bottle.  I put 1 tsp in a cold bottle of water and shook it up and it all dissolved perfectly.  I added some stevia and it tasted perfect!  Great price. Definitely recommended!
0,Packaged in a big manila envelope.  Nothing written on it.  Odd.  not sure how many are in it and I'm not wasting my time counting. Not very professional looking.
0,Pretty good, but I prefer Vigo brand.
0,If you like mulberries, buying in bulk is much less expensive, but still kind of pricey. Make sure you like them first, because the five pound bag is expensive! I tried mulberries in a smaller pouch before I decide to buy this size. They come in a resealable heavy duty bag. Keep it in a dry place or they will stick and lump together. Bulk also tends to crumble the berries somewhat.
0,This is hands down the best tea brand. The bag keeps it fresh for the entire time that the tea is in there, for us that being about 8 months of daily drinking of tea. Good flavor, no bitterness. Love it!
0,This product came in good condition. I enjoyed it as usual. I recommend the product. It is a pleasure. :-)
0,This is a convenient good treat. Would like to see it in a sturdier rounder container. More tub like. These tend to be a little seasonal. Not always easy to find in stores especially in large quantities. They are a little pricey. Reiminiscent of a product you might ask for half a pound of at a counter. Love the different flavors.
0,Don't eat this chocolate with its delectable caramel and cream filling. It is far too tasty and will soon have you in it's killer grip, leaving you to work extra hours so you can spend all your cash on bars and bars of Milka. If you eat these chocolate bars at will,  you will have to spend 23-1/2 hours a day using a StairStepper, or you will soon resemble Jabba the Hutt.		However, if you have an ounce of self-control (I do not), then you can savor this wonderful chocolate as a special treat and suffer no ill effects. You can discover that the chocolate tastes best at a slightly warm room temperature, when it's just about to get squishy. It then melts in your mouth, the flavors bursting like firecrackers on your tongue. But.  This is only for people with amazingly strong willpower, people who will say "OMG, this is the best eighth of a chocolate bar I have ever eaten, I must now put the rest of it away and eat plain lettuce for the rest of today."		I find this chocolate totally addictive and therefore cannot recommend it to anyone who has normal willpower. However, if you are one of those people with amazing hidden superpowers, then by all means enjoy some of the most delicious chocolate you will ever eat.  (BTW, the Hazelnut Milka is even better!)
0,I had never tried this product before and although very tasty it was not as spicy as I was expecting.
0,THE BEST
0,my order arrived in good time. there was no damage. looking into the clear plastic bag i can see that the pecans look good and fresh. the pecans are very fresh and they taste very good to me. the majority of the pecans are nice sized and there are very few broken up pecans in the bag. i am happy with this order and i will order them again. i will keep a close eye on the price. thank you.		update january 14, 2014: my next two bags arrived undamaged and i could tell by looking and tasting the product that the quality, freshness, and color of the pecans was even better than the first order that i had received. this is a product of mexico. my freshness date on these two bags was december 04, 2014. i am very happy with this order. thank you.
0,I eat this plain or with yogurt.  Good taste.
0,To date this has been the best brand!
0,Good
0,We will likely buy these next time.  We tried what we thought was a better deal, but they were stale.  These are good.
0,Great for lattes.
0,Fun to eat....yummy taste.....kids love them.....arrived fresh, quick, well packed......happy customer.
0,Taste great. They are sweetened.
0,Love this - high-quality and delicious.
0,Good stuff. The real deal. Good flavor, good smell. Stays fresh. Like the can.
0,ok but like tisters better
0,Like.
0,delicious !!!! the little taste of salt is just right
0,I bought these first at a bulk buy club. I love these on salads!!!! It's a great healthy (high protein) addition to soups and salads!
0,really good with dips.  we used them with an Italian dip similar to spaghetti sauce only thicker.  they are sturdy enough to not break even when the dip contains chunks of onion, pepper, and tomato.  a very good contrast to the usual sour cream based dips and chips
0,Works as advertised. This is my first experience with Xantham Gum, its very cool stuff. Only a tiny amount will cause thickening and no change to the flavor profile of your food.
0,Very flavorful and when you put every seasoning in, it's really spicy so be careful! This is one of the better tasting noodles.
0,Kids love these.  Chia bars can be a little slimey when warm, so don't keep it in your back pocket if you think this might bother you.	These bars are a bit pricey, so I wait for sales and buy them for special occasions for the kids.
0,Always a big Black Tiger fan, but have to admit Wake-up Call  has a less bitter flavor!  Both are winners in my books! Great coffee at a great price!
0,Well, this is one fine set of flavored oils. I use a few drops to flavor an entire dish. A few drops on the bottom of my cast iron pan provides a fantastic flavor to my eggs. Steam asparagus and finish with a drop or two swirled into the dish. The flavors are very intense, only a few drops are required.	I can heartily recommend these for your culinary needs.
0,These are so tasty!
0,haven't used yet, but heard it's tasty.
0,Not sure if it's a placebo effect or if it actual works but I do get the impression that I can concentrate better after a couple of these drinks.
0,This is pretty decent coffee at the right price here!
0,I recommend this coffee to anyone who likes a strong but wonderfully tasting coffee.  It is, by far, my favorite of all the K cups.
0,Excellent cashews.
0,Tasty, calming to the stomach and curbs or more less cuts off your desire to continue snack eating due to the ginger taste but in a good way.
0,Great product.
0,I have been trying to find the great tasting tea I'm served at my favorite Sushi bar...I've finally found it...I go thru a full pot on my own!  Love this stuff with just a touch of sweetener (Stevia) it's great! No bitter aftertaste very smooth!		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Foojoy-Wuyi-Mt-Oolong-Wu-Long-Weight-Loss-Tea-100-Tea-Bags/dp/B001467JYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Foojoy Wuyi Mt.

0,Super yummy! These Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Dark Chocolate Nut Bars were much better than we expected them to be. I ordered them (via Subscribe and Save with an added Amazon coupon) because they were such a good buy but we'll be ordering more.		Their consistency is a bit like a rice crispy bar with a dark chocolate base and the nuts throughout make them pretty addictive! Nutrition facts keep them somewhat guilt free to boot! (Somewhat because it depends how many or often you eat them, lol.)		Dee~lish!! Highly recommended... Smile. Hope this is helpful!
0,I have been using this seasoning for over two years now and I love it.  It makes anything you season it with taste great.  It's so good, my mom and sister use it too!  Repeat purchase...
0,yummy
0,love seaweed and for the price.!!
0,I love this and I love the smell. Some bloggers from India, the Caribbean and Myanmar have advised that washing food in vinegar, salt and turmeric is customary and that food poisoning outbreaks Americans are experiencing so frequently are a rarity in their hot countries. Let's follow their lead, shall we?		Vinegar and Lemon Juice Treatments	A few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of vinegar and lemon juice (weak organic acids) as anti-microbial and anti-browning agents. In controlled studies, the best results in microbial reduction have been achieved when use of organic acids were combined with other treatments, such as a water rinse and/or agitation. In one such study, apples were spot inoculated with Salmonella enterica, wetted with 1 teaspoon of water or vinegar (5% acetic acid), rubbed for 5 or 30 seconds, rinsed with water, and dried with a paper towel. Dipping in vinegar, followed by rubbing for 5 seconds, rinsing with running water, and drying with a paper towel resulted in a reduction of 5.2 to 6.2 log CFU per apple, which was significantly (p<0.05) larger than reductions achieved with water washing alone (3.1 log CFU per apple).		Another study evaluated the effectiveness of household products, including lemon juice and vinegar, in reducing levels of E. coli on iceberg lettuce. E. coli reductions were 2.1 log CFU/g when inoculated lettuce samples were exposed to 13% lemon juice and 2.6 logs CFU/g when samples were exposed to 13% lemon juice and agitation (10 min.). The authors concluded that 13% lemon juice was significantly (P<0.05) more effective when combined with agitation.		Wednesday, September 27, 2006		K-STATE FOOD MICROBIOLOGIST RECOMMENDS WASHING PRODUCE, USING SPICES, VINEGAR TO REDUCE THREAT OF E. COLI IN FRESH, PREPACKAGED PRODUCE		MANHATTAN -- While packaged spinach has been removed from store shelves nationwide following an E. coli outbreak that has been linked to at least one death and a number of illnesses, how safe is that prepackaged salad mix or fresh produce, such as lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, strawberries, etc., you just purchased?		According to a Kansas State University food microbiologist, you may be getting more than you bargained for.		Daniel Y.C. Fung, a K-State professor of animal sciences and industry and of food science, said although the recent spinach incident is an isolated case and should not be an indication of the safety of all fresh produce in the United States, consumers should take precautions before eating any produce -- prepackaged or not.		"Once consumers buy these packages, often they just open them up and eat them," Fung said. "With hamburger, we can tell people to cook to 160 degrees Fahrenheit and it will be sure to kill salmonella or E. Coli, but with salads, we have no idea. You go to supermarket, buy the bagged produce, dump out and eat. You don't know if it has E. coli."		Fung said consumers can protect themselves by washing produce in running water for five minutes or more and by not letting the produce come in contact with any thing contaminated by other raw foods such as raw meat, fish, etc., before eating.		Fung, who has devoted his career to developing faster processes for detecting spoilage and harmful and beneficial microorganisms in food and the environment, also has studied how spices can deter foodborne pathogens. His research has discovered that use of common spices like clove and garlic can kill up to 99 percent of the E. coli bacteria in ground beef.		To reduce microbes in fresh produces, Fung recommends "generous use of vinegar and spices" in salad dressings. "This may reduce 90 percent to 99 percent of the microbes in the produce," he said. "Leftover fresh produce also should be refrigerated after use as soon as possible."		Fung initiated an international workshop on rapid methods and automation in microbiology in 1981. The workshop has attracted more than 3,500 scientists from 60 countries. He also is a consultant to the food industry and microbiological diagnostic companies.
0,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  SPLENDA HAS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME.  GREAT PRICING AND PACKETS CAN GO IN ZIP LOCK SNACK BAGS IN MY PURSE EASILY.  USE THE LARGE BAGS FOR BAKING AND DESERTS.  NO AFTERTASTE FOR ME.
0,I bought this while visiting so I would not have to make my own - which I always do at home. I was very pleased! It does taste more like Miracle Whip than Hellman's, but it is not nearly as sweet and the flavor is mild. I use olive oil in my homemade version (recipe: Julia Child) which is strongly flavored just like olives. Not everyone likes olives, or olive oil, so this one is a good alternative. I love olives and olive oil, and I still really like this!		Here are the ingredients from the jar:  Avocado Oil, Cage-free egg yolks, filtered water, organic cage free whole eggs, organic distilled white vinegar, organic honey, organic mustard (organic mustard seed, distilled organic vinegar, organic spices), salt, organic rosemary extract.		If you avoid soy, canola, and GMOs, this might be worth a try. Just FYI, avocados are on the EWG's Clean Fifteen list, so avocado oil is an excellent choice.
0,Quite possibly the best purchase that I've ever made.  It was like being transported back to a much better childhood.  These did taste like the Lucky Charms marshmallows, but without the nasty cardboard crunchies.
0,This coffee is so good that I won't buy any other brand. I drank it growing up at my grandparents table and it's still just as good as it was then!		If you want an honest American cup of of coffee 8 o'clock is your brand!!		Note: there is a difference between the 8 o'clock columbian and regular coffees in that the columbian coffee is slightly stronger with a fuller flavor.	We use the regular grind as a switch off with a milder flavor for that second pot of the day. It's just as good a coffee.
0,This one tastes AMAZING!!!! It's flavor is really good. I like that it's large enough to fill you up.  The cons would be the bloating and gas + horrible HORRIBLE breath after drinking it.  It feels like the drink coats your mouth with rotting milk. Pack a toothbrush folks!
0,I tried this just for something different from regular Yerba Mate. Love the difference because the flavor is huge!! I don't drink coffee, but my mom in law does and trying to switch to tea was a big deal for her. This tea made it a much easier transition. She also loved the flavor, since its close to coffee. I love it with sweet italian cream and with creme brule flavor cream, like a dessert,,,YUM.
0,good
0,Aromatic, fresh, wonderful taste.
0,Quick delivery, would order again
0,I love the taste, it reminds me of Silk regular milk, not the sweeter vanilla flavored Silk. It's great for a meal substitute but need to eat at least one real meal the same day. Pleasantly surprised after reading reviews about the taste.
0,My dad loves these so this bulk pack makes a great add on Christmas gift.  The small size keeps him moderated instead of eating a whole bar at once.
0,Good stuff
0,Makes great gingerbread and baked beans.  Nice stuff.
0,These are my husbands favorite Gluten and non dairy free cookies, a little pricey but just watch for sales and have Amazon price match and do subscribe and save and you have yourself free shipping also.
0,the original cheerios . a good size box 14 ounce. good date one the cereal and	healthy morning cereal. try it .
0,Really excellent rice. I've never had anything like it. Beautiful texture (I used my ancient rice cooker), great aroma and fantastic taste. Looks amazing on the plate. Buy a glass spice jar like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/RSVP-Square-Glass-Spice-Jar/dp/B002UTKP8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">RSVP Square Glass Spice Jar</a>&nbsp;and put the extra rice in it, the uncooked rice is beautiful to look at. Remarkable product, 100% recommended.
0,Great flavor n very fresh
0,I really like this product. It gives me an option for days I just don't need any more cream in my coffee or tea. It's not quite as creamy as I would like, thus the four stars, but it lightens your coffee or tea and sometimes that is all I need. It adds a little flavor, like a nut milk would. The carton is convenient. I take it to work and leave it in the fridge. It will fit in a backpack for a weekend trip. It's a little pricey, coming down to about $3.50 per carton delivered and it's about a pint size, but it's made of only wholesome ingredients like almond milk and coconut cream. Great for vegetarians, paleo, and as for myself, I'm a Trim Healthy Mama so it works really well for "E" and "FP" meals.  It's helped me make those type of breakfast days work.
0,Addicted to Newman's coffee however it is getting expensive.
0,We love this pizza sauce, having used it for years. Not just for pizza, I have used it for a base for spaghetti sauce as well as soups and casseroles. It adds such a nice flavor. Always a hit, we keep coming back for more.
0,I was hooked on the regular angel hair shirataki noodle pasta and I decided to try this one.  I like it even more than the regular. It has a 'softer' texture or something. It makes a quick filling meal...sometimes I just put pasta sauce over it and put a bit of parm cheese.....and it is 'just like' spaghetti!!!!  Be sure to rinse them well, as they have an odd fishy smell, unless you are making shrimp stir fry with it.....then it doesn't matter at all!		I recommend these noodles if you are trying to cut out traditional pasta because of the carb/calorie factor!
0,They taste wonderful and fresh!
0,Exactly what I wanted.
0,I wish KIND bars weren't so expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for:	Simple ingredients, good flavors, better nutrition. I like the way these bars satisfy and nourish.
0,They have a good taste but almost no heat. I like hot and these do not have much heat.
0,I have really enjoyed this tea.
0,great!
0,Taste is not great, kinda grainy, but if you use a blender and add some fruit it masks it well.
0,These are absolutely delicious! I only ever could find dates that are dry and boring in taste, but these are so soft and almost creamy inside. And the taste! Amazing!
0,this is one of my favorite k-cups.  so much more delish than other vanilla coffee flavors, the biscotti part makes it so tasty.
0,These work great for me being a type 1 diabetic and I miss my pasta! By no means does this taste like pasta but it helps to have cheese sauce or red marinara. They smell really bad but I drain and rinse - add salt and heat either on the stove top ior microwave. I add butter and salt. The rice packets (or sub for rice) are okay. I use them to make rice pudding and enjoy it.
0,I love the taste of cinnamon and these K cups give me a great fix. Love the fact that they are recycleable too! Nice strong flavor.
0,If you are making bread at home, you'll probably see this product and the non-diastatic version mentioned in some recipes.  If you've tried to make bagels and pretzels but aren't getting a rich flavor or dark crust, this could be the secret ingredient missing from your recipe.  I wouldn't be able to make pretzel rolls this brown without burning them if I didn't use diastatic malt.
0,Well, I've now tried nearly all the extra bold k cups with my b30.  Coffee people definitely make the strongest	as well as having the viscosity of a traditional brew.  Even though most extra bold  k cups can be brewed	stronger with less water, they taste "thin".  Coffee people k cups seem to have just the right amount of	thickness in the mouth, that satisfying "hey, this is coffee" feel.  First off, I have to give props to Amazon's	subscribe and save program. I ordered these on the morning of the 4th and when I went outside the	next morning, they were on my porch!!!!!!!  Wow!!!!!  Nevada to California overnight delivery. And free	shipping. Dang...  Back to the coffee, I can compare this most to Black Tiger.  More bite, a bit of a	tobacco finish, perhaps not as complex as Black Tiger, but tastes a bit stronger on the front side.	My eyes popped open a little bit faster than they do with Black Tiger and the taste lingered on	my palate longer.  I think I'm going to pretty	much stick to the CP Trilogy for my morning cuppa. But I like it dark, bold, with a bit of acid.	YMMV.
0,These candies are delicious and so flavorful! I found this bag at my local 168 Market for $1.99, but if you don't have an Asian Supermarket nearby and love Guava candies, then the 5.99 price tag on Amazon is worth it! The Bag is pretty big and the candies are so good!
0,Love this peanuts but with all the fuss about aflactoxin and heavy pesticides contamination, I hope planters gets on the organic wagon soon.
0,Excellent salt
0,This has become a staple product in my home and I drink it daily.  Will definitely purchase again.
0,What can I say...Kool Aid is Kool Aid.  Good price from Amazon, and it's unsweetened, so I can add my spenda to it to my liking.  Thank you.  Will buy again.
0,I baked cakes with this flour and my family couldn't tell it was gluten-free
0,Love these for all ages and activities.
0,love the flavor. love the ingredients. love the taste.
0,I'm quite pleased with this, being a repeat purchaser.
0,Very fruity candies! The family loves these. They are nice and chewy and the flavors are amazing! I will be ordering again!
0,These are so good that it is very hard to just eat one square a day.  The 60% Cacao is very good for you which is why I bought them.  Of course they are very pricey.  They also packed and shipped them very well.  They put them in a silver bag, the type that keeps them cool, and then they put cooling packs in the box with them to keep them at a good temperature and they do not overheat and melt.  They also came pretty fast.
0,Wonderful flavor.  So tasty and delicious.	Great packaging in a container for easy	storage in your pantry.  Love these !!
0,A little pricey. but I Loved it...
0,Nothing to complain about.  I like a strong breakfast tea and this is is.
0,love them
0,Love it
0,I wasn't too sure whether or not I was going to like these.	While I am a fan of bison, I'm not a fan of "meat sticks" versus regular jerky (which I LOVE).	But, I am a sucker for cranberry. So I took a chance.		I love these.	Seriously. They are delicious!	And calorically sensible.		The only "cons" I can think of are:	Price: A little pricy. But pretty much any bison products are.	Packaging: The peel-off layer doesn't always peel off cleanly and needs to be cut any way.		That's it though. Good stuff!
0,These taste great but I can't even eat them because the bag was smushed by something else in my order.
0,These taste more like cookies than graham crackers. But they are so so good.
0,These are great.  Just enough of a hint of chili flavor to make it uniquely tasty.  Great Price.  This is two or more words Amazon
0,Very fresh and I will be purchasing again from you....I also purchased 5lb bag of peanuts and I was very pleased with the taste and freshness of these also...ty ms
0,WONDERFUL COFFEE!		Delicious and smooth. Great every day coffee blend for the casual and regular coffee drinker. It's strong enough for the true coffee drinkers who want some flavor and a kick in the morning but not over powering. The flavor is consistent from bag to bag (Between Costco and online here at Amazon I have bought more than I'd like to admit...) It's well worth the money and considerably better than drinking pre-ground bulk brands.
0,These taste so good! If you like a flavored pistachio, the salt and pepper is really good!
0,The Certified Dried Apricots https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XTR58VJ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3?th=1, are very tasty, not too sweet, addicting	This Company is another one of my favorite ones...all the products we have tried have been excellent.
0,Great taste, and I have had several flavors. Only 80 cal. each and that is a big deal for me as I need high protein and this is low fat for a beef product.
0,I bought this tea for drinking it 30 mins. before "bedtime" and so far it has helped me get a more sound sleep. I love Yogi!
0,Just what I wanted
0,This is by far the best gluten free gravy brand I have tried!  I have used this one as well as the mushroom blend.  Both cook up quickly and taste great!  I was surprised at how nicely this thickened up when compared to a leading brand packet of "normal" gravy.  Buying in bulk through amazon surly saves quite a bit as well.
0,I live in Seattle, which is the most coffee centric city in the US (we love our coffee and drink it year round) but I prefer an Italian roast, which isn't the most popular type of coffee here. Cafe Umbria is located here in Pioneer Square and the first time I tried it I thought I'd died and gone to coffee heaven. I'm not always willing to make the trek down to the flagship store, but fortunately I can purchase it by the bag and make it at home. Absolutely delicious whether you want espresso or drip. I send it to friends who then become hooked. It's my favorite!
0,Good
0,Great tasting and I just can't put them down.  I bought them to eat while driving but I've found that I take them everywhere with me.  Wonderful product
0,Good flavor.  Good amount of spice (heat) for me, but a little too spicy for my best friend.  I use it over Annie Chun's Brown Rice Noodles, Pad Thai (also available on Amazon.com super saver subscriptions).  I use two packets to make enough for 4 large meals.  Great with honey roasted peanuts on top.  The sauce is ready-to-eat (not a powder).  After cooking meat or tofu, just pour this sauce over cooked noodles and simmer through so the noodles absorb the flavor.  Actually, I put the dry noodles, water and the sauce all in at the same time.  I like to add Teriyaki sauce to add a little more sweetness and flavor.  This is a great way to tone down the spice for those who like almost no spice.  I would buy these again.
0,Finely ground and fresh.
0,This packet is functional.  It's just as easy to make as out of a can.  I have no complaints nor any excessive praise.  This will definitely work with that spaghetti or penne that you may be making.
0,These chocolate cookies are an organic version of Oreo-type cookies but are far superior than that name brand, in my opinion.  They are seriously addicting and I cannot buy them anymore because I tend to eat toooooooo many and the package is gone in a couple/few days.  They are not particularly healthy - they are a cookie, after all!  The cookie part is nice and crunchy (almost tending toward light and crisp) with an excellent chocolate flavor.  The filling is great - smooth and creamy (does not get hard like some other oreo-types) with a good degree of sweetness.  I have also tried the Paul Newman brand of oreos and was not that impressed.  The Country Choice far exceeds all other brands - highly recommend!
0,Positively my most favorite of the Health Valley Organic No Salt Added Soups.  This is a fantastic product at an unbeatable price.  It's impressive how the calories are so low and the sodium is insanely low.  I do take my "dash" measuring spoon and add that much salt so it's palatable.  But if you are strictly restricted and don't want to make your own, this is the way to go.
0,Love this.  Great price plus saves a little on packaging
0,Great taste
0,just randomly picked this product as it reminded me of true indian chai. i am truly amazed with aroma and flavor of this tea.  wonderful combination of ginger and cardamom and blended well with cinnamon and cloves. i did see this tea is not very strong and i end up using 2 tea bags but its just matching my taste. very glad i picked this product. i will be buying this item again.
0,I love the Twinings tea variety pack.  I only drink hot tea during the March -April timeframe of the year and I am always so pleased when I reach for the Twinings.  They are so smooth and flavorful and don't not upset my stomach like the Lipton Tea does.  Love it!
0,Bought it from Costco. 1 bottle for $10. Excellent product. Will not burn. Leaves no taste at all in deep fryer. Sauteed potatoes are super. Love this product.
0,These particular Kind Bars are my favorite of the ones which I have tried so far.  Excellent bars which I have not tired of yet!
0,This is a lovely blend of bergmont and lavender.  Very refreshing.  An enjoyable cup of tea on a cold day.
0,Excellent coffee! I am a repeat buyer. Highly recommend!
0,I mix this and Turmeric powder to jumpstart my day or when I feel really tired. It gives me a lot of energy and my digestive system and energy has improved greatly after a few weeks of taking this powder.
0,I'm not a fan of medium or light roast coffees, so I was absolutely thrilled to open this bag and find these beans dark, oily and smelling absolutely wonderful.  I'm pretty sure this is the darkest roast I've ever seen, and the coffee it makes is great.  Not burnt-tasting, not acidic.  Just brilliantly dark.
0,Really nice seasonings that are very flavorful.  It is interesting how much the price of this item varies on amazon - if you wait long enough, you will find it just under $4.00.
0,Soy flour is much more expensive than this in the grocery store.  The pachages are sealed well and the quality is great.  It's a great substitue for part of the flour when baking.
0,Great taste and low sugar content!
0,This is the best tea in the world.  I just wish I could buy it in Alaska.
0,This was a gift for being an Amazon Mom's member; thanks Amazon!  We love you!
0,This is my favorite tea from Tea Forte! its a delicious combination of jasmine and mint tea! It's a very smooth tasting tea. with only a moderate caffiene amount, it doesn't give me the jitters and is a nice pick me up afternoon tea. highly recommended!
0,Got this as a bday gift and the person loved it. Fun, yummy snacks. Just eat them and the gift is gone. No waste, nothing left over!
0,Canned blackberries. They are what they're supposed to be. I'm not sure what posessed me to buy a whole case but I guess thats the only way thay were being sold. The Oregon brand canned fruits that I've tried are super high quality and worth the price.
0,great quality as advertised
0,I bought this for Christmas and everyone loved the pancakes. They come out a little flat but they are still delicious!!
0,This is a three-star product with an extra star added because Amazon's customer service is outstanding.  Our tulips arrived in a nice box but inside, they weren't ballooned or in any other type of water retention device.  I've never ordered tulips before, so perhaps this is the standard way to ship them, but the Kabloom flowers I ordered for Valentine's day and Mother's day (and another set of Kabloom orchids i sent with these) always arrive with some form of water container to keep the stems immersed.  Beyond that, two tulips had damaged stems, damaged as in the stems looked crushed and the buds were hanging 180-degrees from the bottom of the stems.  Three or four were so droopy, they looked like they had semicircular bends in the stems.  I'm not sure if these issues are just unique to Tulips (it's possible that tulips just aren't hearty enough for shipping like this) or if these were just old flowers (e.g., left over from Mother's Day).  Either way, the flowers themselves were somewhat disappointing and judging from the reviews below, there seems to be some consistency problem with these.  However, Amazon's support was it's usual amazing.  I just clicked the "return/replace item" link in the order summary and was prompted to describe the issue to process my "return."  I use quotes because after i was done, i was told not to actually return them (smart, because why waste more money shipping bad flowers back to the warehouse), so we paid for a bouquet of 15 tulips and ended up getting a free bouquet of 9 or so tulips.  I expected to find a number to call Benchmark so they could immediately dispatch a fresh batch of replacements next day (as reviews for Kabloom seem to indicate is their practice for dealing with bad bouquets), but I certainly can't argue with an immediate no-questions-asked full refund.  I will try Benchmark again, but will try a different type of flower (e.g., Roses, something I know can be shipped successfully) so I can do a proper comparison.
0,I'd recommend this tea to anyone looking for a tasty, cheaper alternative to the herbal teas at Teavana. It's fruity and sweet, tastes good iced or hot, and although it isn't fancy it is a great everyday tea.  Very strong cranberry taste, though, so much that it drowns out everything else.  For the price it's a very good blend.
0,I am a 75 year old man of average weight that started taking this product 6 months ago..  Since taking it I have had a noticeable increase in muscle and decrease in fat plus I have lost a few pounds with no effort on my part.  For years I have suffered with back pain that various doctors have told me will not be relieved by surgery or shots.  Since taking this daily my back pain has almost completely disappeared.  My wife, who is a retired nurse thinks it is because the muscles supporting my spine have become stronger.
0,I use this in all of my cooking in place of cow's milk. I even use at times to make a mock cream of mushroom soup for cooking. It is a staple in our household. I would give 5 stars but still concerned with the carrageen.
0,Where I live I can't even imagine a store selling this, so it became my high valued imported item to snack on! Great quality prettify steep price in comparison of america where I can buy it!
0,Wonderful flavor and a great price for green tea.
0,I ordered this while it was on a good sale. It is very popular at my Airbnb rental. I have many nice reviews from guests that appreciate good coffee.
0,Convenient packaging, and a delicious product. Carry it in my purse to add to my bottled water throughout the day. Great concept.
0,I I am a regular of your products for 3 years now. LOVE THE BAKLAVA!!! I always order 2 at a time and send gifts also. Everyone loves it!! I did notice that a change of recipe (even more delicious), package has changed a bit and just wanted to say NICE JOB, GREAT PRODUCT, AWESOME FAST SERVICE!!  LOVED this Baklava!  This wasn't super sweet,  just PERFECT sweet! This is DEFINITELY my go-to Company  (even though I would have been able to use the "prime"service, it wasn't one. EVERYONE SAID THAT EXACT SAME THING about this product! Delicious,  not sweet like American made,  light and airy, full of nutty flavors! !
0,Who don't love oreos
0,Love these chocolates although these were under par. The chocolate on them was speckled white and the orange and coffee ones were as hard as rocks, not soft as they should be.
0,I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure most of the food people ate for the last few thousand years was either animal or plant . It wasn't until recently we thought it would be cool to put chemicals into food that prevented bacteria from being able to break it down. Now when you consider that your intestines are loaded with beneficial bacteria that do just that so we can get nourishment from our food, it makes you wonder just how good of an idea that is. That's a big reason why I like Oberto - It's natural. No MSG, no BHA or BHT, just real beef that's prepared with simply things your body needs anyway, like salt, so that it last a good long time without refrigeration. That's what jerky has been for hundreds of years. So why do the other brands feel the need to add all that junk? Are they not actually making jerky? Do they want it to last longer then it should? If you like a softer jerky I would recommend Oberto's pork jerky, which is now my favorite. But if you love a traditional taste and texture, you'll have to make your own to find any better then this. It's got a good "chew" to it without being overly tough. I prefer the "original" over the flavored offerings, but that's just me. And even though they use salt, the sodium content is still about half of what most other jerkys contain. Give it a try. Even if you're "taste bud challenged" and don't think it tastes better then any other brand, you'll still be doing yourself a favor by not putting a bunch of chemicals in your body that the human digestive system has historically never had to deal with.
0,On time and as promised
0,The Gourmesso pods are much less money and provide a decent cup.  They are not as good, IMO as what you get from Nespresso but I will continue to buy them because I can pawn them off on guests to save money on the coffee freeloaders in my life.		The pods are made from plastic unlike the aluminum pods from Nespresso.  Also as others have commented, they are not as tightly packed with coffee and tend to flow much quicker than the Nespresso pods.		I would suggest to anyone to give these a try to see if they meet your needs.
0,Excellent product
0,A great cup of decaf
0,any dandelion product is great. more of it! It could be more strong.
0,Great for just starting out.
0,tasty
0,My grocery store is a little too far for me to travel to so this large 8 pound  size is really helpful.  Thank you.
0,Fried some chicken on my low carb diet with it. Good stuff. Not exactly the same thing but good none the less. Husband ate it up and he's not dieting! I was so satisfied to have fried chicken on a diet. I'm so looking forward to making other recipes like pancakes, etc with the Soy Flour. And Bob's Red Mill is a quality company. I have several of their products and am happy with all of them. I love to cook so excited to have a lot of it on hand.
0,The cornmeal is good. I just can't quite remember why I bought 4 packs of 24 ounces each!  This contains 6 lbs of cornmeal, in case you didn't notice the quantities.  Does anyone have some good recipes that call for more than 1 cup????
0,You either love Vegemite or hate it!  I LOVE it.  I eat it off the spoon and spread on crackers.  What I received was fresh and in great condition.
0,I have used this smoked paprika in a few recipes and can tell a difference between it and regular paprika. I even use it as a quick sprinkle on eggs and things. Makes for great value for quantity, highly recommend for anyone doing bbq rubs as it will add to flavor.
0,Delicious, although the spiciness could be toned down a tad. But still, worth buying!
0,Mmmmmmmm, if you like hot chocolate and can remember a Charleston Chew or Sugar Babies then you will love this assortment.		The single cups work perfect in my K-cup coffee maker and all of them taste fantastic!  Our grand kids love to dig through the box and pick out their favorites.  All the flavors are authentic and have a nice rich chocolatey flavor.		I will definitely buy these again they are a big hit in our family.  Thanks Two Rivers!  :)
0,Nice packing and yummy candy.
0,excellent
0,Great Product - Yummy
0,I keep these on auto-renew.  You can skip a month if you have too many left over.  They hold their freshness in the bag, then I put them in a baggie.  Great snack, or cut them to go on top of a salad or wrap hummus in them or rice...very versatile.  Has iodine.
0,These are absolutely wonderful for travelling! You make them exactly as you would make a cup of tea: add the bag to some hot water, add sugar or creamer and voila! No need for filters or ground coffee or a machine!
0,By far the best vanilla I own. I collect vanilla from all over mexico.
0,Very good, gone in no time.
0,Used this coffee for a mix of several types to create a smooth and tasty coffee. Smelled pretty good, and had one cup of this one alone, and it was very nice even though I do not drink flavored coffees by themselves, for I mix them with regular beans with a lot of kick, creating a final product that it is much less bitter and easy to enjoy. 4 Stars.
0,Purchased this coffee for my friend, she loved it.  I used to live in Germany, it is the same coffee and a very good price.  I will buy more in the future.
0,Just as expected; Not so darn salty !!
0,I am a major bbq fanatic I have a rec tec smoker and a weber grill.  I use this on all red meat.  People love it the flavor is amazing
0,I tried this with several of Nicole Hunn's gluten free recipes including won ton wrappers, which I desperately miss. It's as close as it gets in the gluten free world.
0,The best!
0,Best cinnamon tea I've found!
0,I bought it on a whim as an "add on" item and I'm really glad I did.  It can be used peanut butter for super low cal smoothies, baked goods and Thai food. There's tons of recipes on Pintrest.
0,Fun stuff and tasty. They of course  have been around for years. I think they were a good buy....didn't do much comparative shopping.
0,Taste like the cinnamon toothpicks from the '90's. Excellent taste, just the right about of hot. If left in car, it takes that extra hot away. I leave all new packages in the car! Best mints ever!
0,I used other brands of tuna for cooking, but could never eat it as such, right out of the can. With this Wild Planet tuna, I can and I thoroughly enjoy it! The taste is so good, all it needs is a touch of lemon juice and voila!, lunch/dinner/snack is ready. I make sure I don't waste a single drop of the juice in the can, it's that good. Cooking the tuna just once before canning probably makes all the difference.		As an added benefit, it's choked full of Omega 3 and protein, has very low fat content, is sustainably caught and the cans contain low amounts of BPA. The relatively high price is the only deterrent from eating it on a daily basis, but I still enjoy it as a treat.
0,Good stuff.
0,Great product!!!!! Hoosier Hill Farms has the best selection. This is the first time I have tried this product and I am very pleased.
0,Just Google corn tortillas recipes and you will see how to make the best homemade ones with just this and water. Nothing like the store bought ones I hate.
0,ok
0,The brand of yeast that I use to make my homemade breads.  Always works great.
0,Quick and easy.  Great Tasting Comfort Food!  Great for Business Travel just heat water in your room and stir.  That is all you need.
0,Love CLIF Kid ZBARs! Finally a healthy, natural product my kids love.  Switching from the major manufacturer's chemical laden bars to something organic and tasty was a long, hard process.  But then we tried these and we fell in love.  The brownie is so yummy, it's a guilty pleasure during the day without the guilt.  Iced oatmeal and chocolate chip are like eating cookies, but so much better.
0,Very good Cumin - great aroma and flavor!
0,Love Harney & Sons teas, love the tins that the beautiful sachets come in. This was wonderful! I wanted a beautiful Oolong tea & that's what I got. There's not a harsh amount of flavor so if you're a person used to a lot of flavoring; this may not be it. But it is a beautiful Oolong. I did smell and enjoy a small amount of Pomegrante in the tea but it's very mild. Am truly enjoying my tin, but not sure that I'll buy the large refill bags to refill my tin once it's used up like I do for the "Paris" (the best tea ever!) or the "Blue/Yellow" (yes I know it's chamomile/lavender/etc.) But it's one of my favorites late at night when reading. I Believe Harney has better varieties but this is smooth and wonderful. Each to his/her own taste.
0,These are very good oranges and these individual packages are just the right size in my opinion. The juice to orange ratio also suits me.
0,After trying these out for review purposes, I turned around and ordered a case, and here is why.  These are the same great taste as other Keebler cookies, but they come in a 2.8 ounce closable cup.  There are about 40 cookies in each cup, totalling about 300 calories for the entire cup - while I don't want to eat the whole cup myself, when the family finds the cup and decides to eat the entire thing, it is a lot better than eating an entire BOX of the same cookies.  :)		So - I ordered them for two reasons - good price, and great storage/size.  I'm using them for treats in lunches, and only putting a few in each lunch.  Since I'm not using them all the same day, the re-closable container is nice and they aren't getting soggy too fast.		In short - these are great to have on hand for family treats and to use on lunches/outings!
0,This is by far my favorite of the Hint waters, and I now buy it in bulk. Just unsweetened water with a hint of honeydew flavor, it is refreshing and calorie free. Some of the other flavors tasted fake to me, even though I believe they're all natural, but this one eally got the flavor right.
0,Are you xylitol to replace all the sugar in my baking. No one ever knows the difference.
0,Great taste!
0,One of the things I love about this is that you get each serving in its own packet so that they always taste fresh. I used to buy this at Sam's Club but when they stopped offering it, I gladly found it on Amazon.
0,Great Coffee great bold taste.
0,Awesome!
0,Beware, this is salty Dutch licorice. Very different from typical licorice found in US.
0,very yummy
0,yum yum. I drink it as juice, without mixing it. Very spicy and addictive! The smell is so appealing too. I've gone through 6 bottles so quickly, and have to keep myself under control! Thinking about it while typing this makes me drool. Could not imagine there was such good juice in this world. If you don't do well with spicy food, stay away.
0,Yummmmmmmmmmmmm.. Fantastic flavor. Low sugar. LOVE IT
0,These are fantastic gluten free biscuits.  They don't taste gluten free.  They are a bit like an Anzac biscuit with chocolate.  We really enjoy them. They are reasonably low sugar as well.
0,We tried this product when we were doing a low carb diet - it is absolutely delicious!  Our friends tried it too and were equally impressed.  Don't eat too much at one time or you may experience gas.  Otherwise - it's a highly recommended sugar-free treat and is of very high quality.
0,Was the best Christmas present for a English friend, they love this stuff. I kid him about this stuff all the time, they even have a cook book. O if you only knew about the jokes. Have a great marmite day.
0,I love this brand of whole grains. I have been using Bob's Red Mill organic flour and grains for years. At the time I made the purchase Amazon had them on sale so unlike the other reviewers, I was very happy with the price. It was much less than I would pay at Price Choppers in upstate New York.
0,Not so bad. Have found that it is selling at WalMart.
0,A little too bitter, conventionally brewed. However, cold brewing produces a balanced and rich flavor I enjoy very much.
0,Good quality product. The only reason I have rated it 4 stars is because its hard to pour out the product without wasting it. Too much powder can spill out when attempting to measure it.
0,very good
0,Good product, will continue to order.
0,I have been trying to stay away from peanuts due to mico-toxins. Also, many kids at my child's school have sever peanut allergies.. cant even touch them. The school asked us not to even send peanut butter sandwiches to school. This stuff tastes great! I was a peanut butter lover, now its almond butter. Low in carbs too!
0,Gave this to my Dad (diabetic) and he loved it.
0,good, came on time
0,perfect
0,Great almond flour. I recommend it for all those who cook paleo and love desserts like me!
0,What a great sauce for ribs
0,SMELLS GREAT
0,Decent price.
0,Fantastic great stuff
0,Love them
0,Sell me more! These things are the perfect breakfast. No, they are just perfect. Better price then the local grocery store and better selection.
0,Feels good to use a broth that is not laden with chemicals.  And, this tastes great.  No complaints at all and only rave reviews from me :)
0,what is not to love?
0,This tea tastes great without a thing added and Amazon has the best price anywhere.  We've even given a couple of boxes away to friends who love it too.
0,Yes
0,these are the best ever. i bought eight bags. soak them overnight. can't eat any sugar of any kind...not even stevia at the moment, and this satisfies the chewing factor and sweetness factor. thank you!
0,GREAT WITH RIBS AND CHICKEN TOO!
0,Love Kind bars!  They are filling and are good for you.  The ingredients are delicious and satisfy the sweet and chocolate craving for me. Everyone in my house loves these and at Amazon the price is right! The combination of sweet and salty is good!
0,This tea is called Himalayan, and Himalayan covers a lot of tea territory, but it can't be too Himalayan or Camellia Sinensis wouldn't make it through the winter.  Picking date was February 2018, maybe it's from Arunchal Pradesh.  It is well-made: big leaves with velvet, deep fresh smell but not floral.  Relatively full taste, nothing insipid about this white tea.  It has a round body or mouth feel, and some subtle "northern" flavour notes when brewed the low end temperature, about 175F, for five or six minutes.  This is a very decent tea, way better, for example, than any familiar brand or grocery store tea, and, given that white tea production is still small, the price is also decent.  Tea from this part of the world is capable of more but it is mostly in terms of complex, even multi-dimensional, flavour notes.  But this taste bouquet makes things pricier in a hurry and and may or may not be your cup of tea. Vahdam has it down in terms of packaging and marketing, and this tea shows that they are interested in moving into more quality as well as the market develops greater awareness.
0,I love Stash teas, especially licorice - my favorite tea!!
0,Everyone I've given these to raves about them.  They are some really great cookies.  They are gluten free, if you care about that.  Doesn't apply for me.
0,Excellent product and as described.  Delivered on time!
0,Fabulous Honey.  The best I have ever tasted.  It is available at Super Supplements in a glass container which I prefer, and at a slightly better price.  Highly Recommended!
0,It's good and it's plenty.
0,I plan on getting more and trying the different flavors. I really like the Sweet Drops products.
0,I love to make macaroon with this product!
0,Taste great!
0,This caesar is really good! It tastes like a standard caesar dressing and all of the ingredients are fresh, the chicken tastes a little cheap (maybe it's the breast and i'm a thigh person) but the cheese and lettuce are good quality.
0,I found that stevia is very concentrated, and all I need to use is about 1/4 to 1/3 of a packet to get great taste and no bitterness.
0,These are thicker and smaller than graham crackers and are more like a cookie than a cracker.  They are also not square like on the box but are a small rectangular cookie.  The texture is fantastic and anyone eating them wouldn't know they were gluten free unless you told them.  Much better tasting in a s'more than regular graham crackers, IMO.  I put one on a small piece of foil and put mini marshmallows on top and broil it until they are brown then put a few chocolate chips on top and smush another cookie over it all.  Delicious and addictive.	Edited: I have now used these to make pie crusts for key lime pie two different times and they work great!  I'm so happy to be able to eat pie now without a stomach ache afterward.
0,Something different
0,I picked up these K-Cups to try for something new tasting. Usually I enjoy bolder coffee, like french roast or espresso. I really liked this K-Cup it was a medium blend coffee. Not to strong or not to light, with some very light flavors of cocoa/nut. I would highly recommend this coffee to anyone looking for something different then what you usually drink everyday.
0,Love them. Expensive, but delicious and healthy so I will buy them again.
0,They taste exactly as they did when I was a kid.  I am enjoying them.  The price is a bit high in my opinion, but if you have a sweet tooth, and loved these from back in the day, I'd recommend ordering them.
0,This is a great sugar substitute. There is no weird aftertaste but there is an icy mouth feel in certain uses. I don't notice it in baked bread items (like muffins) but when I made a glaze with it to ice my muffins, that's when I noticed the cool sensation.
0,We were p-pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of these cashews.  They will continue to be on our to buy list.  We used them to enhance (for us) other Happy Belly products.  Happy Belly and these nuts have been a great find for us!
0,Amazing figs! They're natures fig newtons!
0,I always buy the cherry. I like it best. But	I order this too. Its also good n gives you as st flavors. So down to this. The candy is good n the delivery is fantastic so far. I am getting tired of Amazons shipping. It was always pretty good. Lately unless you pay for prime the shipping is getting slower n slower. This candy ALWAYS has gotten my candy to me promt n as fast as possible.
0,I have tried Twinings and Bigelow, this has a more delicate, fresher taste.  It is double wrapped in foil, not paper.		Give it a try, you will enjoy if you like a lighter flavored tea.
0,as described...
0,I can't pronounce it right, but my mouth doesn't care. At all. I love this stuff. Not sure why it's compared to spaghetti, it's basically just a slightly thicker ramen than usual, which is awesome.  I can tweak the amount of water I cook it with for thinner or thicker sauce, and the sauce rules. Oil is in a separate pack so I can adjust how much I want of it too.  It's not spicy at all which I prefer...I can add in heat however I want.  And if that wasn't enough, it's got somewhere near 1/3 less sodium than the average ramen.  Thanks, beans.
0,Always good especially with enjoy life chocolate chips, a great paleo snack especially if you love carbs like me
0,it's very tasty.  I'm afraid that once it gets humid though, it's gonna get sticky.
0,tastes great and easy to make
0,Excellent product. I will purchase again. Highly recommended.
0,Great addition to my smoothies. From everything I've read, I'm expecting my next blood work to reflect the benefits. I keep ordering this great tasting addition
0,Very good. Would buy from again
0,excellent product!
0,Fantastic! This stuff is perfect, because it tastes like pumpkin pie without being loaded down with sugar. If I want sugar in my coffee, I add sugar. This is pretty much just the flavor of pumpkin pie, with a little sweetness added. It even came with a plastic pump to put on top, so you can easily portion out the syrup. Oh, and the bottle is plastic, which I really really appreciated, actually. It's nice to not worry about breakage.		Bravo, Amoretti! You hit the ball out of the park with this one. I will definitely buy again -- I'm thinking maybe something for the holiday season, like peppermint? Thanks!
0,great tasting gum
0,This is the best coffee out there. Gevalia stays mellow and doesn't get bitter, no matter how long its been sitting in the pot.
0,Great grains, as they are not truely rice. Great chew. This is the best of the.
0,Chocolate tastes vary of course, and I'm still looking for the perfect bar. This one comes very close.	Regular milk chocolate is between 30-45% cocoa with 45% ranging on a very deep milk chocolate that's slightly bitter and 30 being very creamy and a lot less intense chocolate flavor. At 41% this is a deep milk chocolate, but unlike the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Scharffen-Berger-Chocolate-Bar-Milk-41/dp/B001SAX59O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Scharffen Berger, Chocolate Bar Milk 41%</a>, the chocolate flavor is not at all bitter, it's a well-balanced chocolate for milk chocolate lovers who like it a bit stronger without verging on a bittersweet flavor.	The bar snaps well, and it starts melting fairly quickly on the tongue releasing the combination of smokey almond flavor, chocolate and the sea salt which really brings out the sweetness and complexity of the chocolate itself. The almond bits are small to blend in well with the chocolate and it has a very nice crunch if you chew the chocolate instead of just letting it dissolve.	After the piece is swallowed, there are hints of chocolate liqueur and the salt on the tongue which is just a lovely aftertaste. Again, no bitterness at all.	I haven't had my dad try any of this one yet, but I think he'll like it.
0,Kind bars are always delicious but priced too high!
0,Thank you
0,This is a wonderful GF cereal!  It is crunchy, a touch sweet, and the fruit is a wonderful addition.  This is the first GF cereal that my son will really eat. He frequently has 2 bowls, and he does not eat much!  Highly recommend.
0,Lately I've become a bit of a peanut snob, buying my own peanuts raw, roasting them myself, and frequently even making my own peanut butter. (Who knew it would be so much better than the kind you buy in a store? Even my kids comment on how much better it tastes.) And memory says that "no salt" ANYthing is essentially flavorless. So I was very happily surprised to find these peanuts taste delicious. They're just the perfect amount of roasted to bring out the strongest peanut flavor (without heating them past the point where things start to taste overdone).		(I realize I sound like a paid commercial and I did get these peanuts for free, but if you look through my other reviews of free items you'll see that I don't often give them 5 stars)
0,I haven't had soda in many years and nowadays am truthfully disgusted by it. I do, however, still enjoy drinking a cold, bubbly, non-alcoholic beverage and the Perrier Lime hits the spot, so to speak. It's a great, healthier alternative to soda when eating snacks, desserts, pizza or whatever else that people normally like enjoy while drinking a soda.
0,These bars are great because they are thick.  I love thick chocolate.  I get tired of today's candy bars that are so thin you barely taste them.  If you like Nestle Crunch you will really love this big thick one.		Some reviewers said theirs came broken in pieces but mine came in tact.  The bar has indentations so you can break the bar into neat squares.
0,So full of flavor, highly recommend .
0,I use these to make scrambled eggs in the morning.  Because they're expensive, I'll use the cheaper brand of powdered eggs in my baking recipes.  Of course these don't taste quite like the real thing, but as close are you're gonna get with powdered eggs.  I wish they had reusable packaging for this product, though.
0,My kids loved it
0,Just a pinch added to foods and beverages promotes good health. This little jar is very fragrant. sniffing it is good for your brain and helps to promote optimism. Dr. Greger discusses research on the benefits of saffron at his site on nutrition.

0,Very good coffee
0,We now use this at work- a good middleground between sugar and artificial sweeteners.  Tastes good and this is a very convenient sized dispenser.
0,We like these.. but.. I got them because I thought they were different from the normal yummy earth lollipops.. and they're not. They're the same lollipops packaged differently. Still taste great.. but I have them in bulk and was a bit disappointed that they were the same exact thing.
0,grand kids loved them
0,We try to eat organic/pasteurized cage free eggs every day...
0,A little bit more spicy than I had expected, But great nonetheless,	Goes great in a Moscow Mule!
0,Enjoy these for a snack.  Get protein and sea salt.
0,I've had this particular bar before and will definitely enjoy my purchase now.
0,GOOD PRODUCT
0,Very yummy and even I can't mess it up (I'm hopeless with rice).
0,Halloween Candy made in usa I love it~~
0,Updated:	So I ended up getting a pack of the Hazelnut after a nice communication from VitaPerk. It did have a nutty taste. Not a very strong hazelnut taste, but certainly a nutty flavor. I tried it with some decaf and did feel a little extra energy. This is certainly better than the plain. So, I upgraded my star rating.		I love hazelnut! I was very excited to try it, however, I received the flavorless pack. And yes, it is pretty flavorless. As for energizing, I didn't notice anything. I used all 7 and have not noticed any difference. If you are someone who can't take pills and can't take a multi-vitamin, this might be an option for you. I would love to have tried the hazelnut, because I would like to have the flavor without using so much creamer (my normal routine). For now, I'll stick with normal routine.
0,Just what I wanted.  Love it
0,Pros: A.OK! This has rich tomato flavor, and not too sweet, tart or spicy.		This blows away the Frankenfood brands with their artificial glop and artificial slop.		Organic is better for you, and the environment. Thanks for supporting this value-added product.		Cons: I wish they could find a way to offer it in reusable glass containers to avoid the plastic bottle that I don't like.
0,great
0,Works pretty good sometimes sticks to the top
0,Had to buy because it is so Exotic!!! Opened the jar and ate three flowers just to try them. They are very tasty. Got the Champagne on ice, and looking forward to the experience. I'm sure it will be a good one.
0,Great price, good bye Wal Mart
0,I love a Wagoner/Ploughman pub lunch.  I can have one at home by combining English cheddar, pickled onions, and crusty bread. Hayward's are made with malt vinegar, so they have a special traditional flavor. I recommend them to anyone, on this side of the pond, who is hankering for a pub lunch.
0,Took a while to get but it was worth the wait. Some of the best chocolate I have ever had
0,just yum yum
0,Tastes great
0,Their jerky's are good, but this was too hot for me.
0,This was a real find for me! It can be used on everything from meat and fish or in stews, and even on scrambled eggs and lunch meats. It's spicy but not too spicy that you're going to have heartburn afterwards. This is my second purchase of this on Amazon and I will continue to buy this when I run out!
0,Tasty
0,Really Nice
0,This is THE MOST delicious salt available, not to mention healthy. Have reordered several times. If you buy the coarse grind you do need a SALT grinder because salt ruins the gears in a pepper mill.
0,Fresh and superb quality.
0,I love the taste of this chai, although I wish that it came unsweetened so that I could add my no-calorie stevia sweetener.
0,as expected
0,I am happy with this product.  It smells really good ... strong vanilla.  It's expensive but so far I am happy with the baking I have done with it.
0,Oh, and it tastes good too. I know I should get up early, put on a pot of whole grain rolled or steel cut oats. But I'm already getting up early so I can water the garden and do some laundry and blah blah blah before heading out to work. So it's so wonderful to reach into the cupboard, grab a packet of instant oatmeal, add a handful of raisins, add a little hot water from the tea pot, and then finish getting dressed while the tea is steeping and the oatmeal is changing from a handful of dried flakes to a wonderful creamy bowl of nice hot oatmeal. With no worry about it boiling over on the stove or in the microwave. And a bowl of this keeps me going for 3 hours, long enough to get a good start on the day.	con: one of the boxes of apple flavored tasted salty. Not overwhelmingly so, but noticeable. Just the one box.
0,We like the taste of the watermelon flavor. Enjoy chewing this gum. I also like the packaging. Great product.
0,I remember the smell of eight oclock coffee being brewed in the local A&P grocery stores.  I love the coffee, but the price is just too high.
0,Always a good choice.
0,Great product. Works well adding to beans for increased digestibility. Also all the added nutrients to foods. Seems safe as to contaminants-trusting the co here, as I would not know unless tested, which the Co does.
0,This was in a sturdy plastic package.
0,is it like adding a heaping spoon of salty butter to your meal? obviously not... but for anybody trying to avoid too much sodium and fat, this is a fantastic substitute
0,perfect product
0,You won't regret buying this product. Makes hot, frothy lattes quick and easy. Very good chocolate flavor. I enjoy a cup nearly every day. It's my treat to myself!
0,I've got this on Subscribe 'n Save.  Thick, pillowy tortillas, a chipotle sauce that I use on lots of other dishes, and a good spice mix.  The spices are a bit too much, if you use the whole pack, so taste-test before you dump it all in at once.  I use the canned Keystone ground beef or pork as the filler.
0,My husband is from Seattle and introduced me to MarketSpice tea. I love it. I use it also for gifts. Excellent product and delicious.
0,I typically use&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Better-Than-Bouillon/dp/B00016LA7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Better Than Bouillon</a>&nbsp;for soup and gravy. I've never used a product that comes close in terms of quality, aside from homemade stock (which is better than anything but takes time to make / space to store). This Maggi Beef Base is just as good if not better than Better Than Bullion. It's tasty (if a touch heavy on salt) and worked really well both in a beef stew and to make a marinade for a roast. I'd use this base again without hesitation.
0,Supporting small business
0,Very satisfied with this product!
0,3 packs to 12 cups.
0,Hot. Sweet. Sticky. I'm a hot sauce addict and this is a nice one to reach for on occasion with a rice bowl, but I wouldn't put it on pizza or fish or on eggs like I do sriracha or other chili pastes. Like it a lot, though, and the heat is pervasive and deep and lingering. Sneaks up on you.
0,I love this coffee!
0,Soo many different choices and flavors good for all people
0,We got tjs once t whole foods and loved it more than Nutella. We prefer our kids to eat this. Only downside is that the pots are small.
0,Delicious! Fresh and a good variety. A good healthy gift for anyone health-minded!
0,I use turmeric everyday in cooking and this is a great product. I do notice that my joints feel better.
0,Wife loves these!
0,This stuff is great! Just add a little water, and it makes a delicious spread that is better than the real thing without the calories!
0,To pull or peel- that is the question.  The ones I got were very fresh and in good condition.
0,I had Falafel the first time in Israel. There it was a street food. I really liked it. In Vermont we don't really have Falafel. I ordered this mix and tahini from Amazon, add the veggies and itr was like being in the middle east again. This is GOOD!
0,These are my favorite dark chocolate bars.  They are natural, therapeutic and taste good.  I love the chocolate nib crunch.  Top of the line dark chocolate!
0,A good size slab of tender and flavorful beef with a proper combination of potato and carrot, and with lots of savory gravy. Surprised that the 10 oz. package has fewer than 300 calories. I'll order more, since I have eaten the last of the six-pack last evening. Thanks!
0,these big bags of candy delight put a big huge smile on my wife's face.  She thought she wasn't go to find these again until next Christmas.  Thanks
0,Good for multiple uses
0,Yes. the bag is going on done
0,Great tasting light crackers which are terrific with salami and cheese or with soups.
0,I love San Francisco kcups - they offer a great variety of flavors at a great price in large batches. A superior coffee for a fraction (~ $.35/kcup) of the normal expense of ~ $1/ea.  My husband likes the smooth flavor of this coffee but finds the roast a bit lighter than he likes. His favorites of San Francisco Bay OneCup are Breakfast Blend & Fog Chaser.  I like milder roast coffees the best but since he drinks more coffee in our house - I took away a star.
0,Great Product thank you!
0,Exactly as expected.
0,Treat yourself to an excellent summer tea. Caffeine free with a naturally sweet and nutty taste, the tea can be brewed hot or cold. If this is your first experience with Japanese mugicha (barley tea), the large tea packet is the most common way it is sold.		Our sons, ages 8 and 7, like mugicha. We don't buy Kool-Aid or other powdered drink mixes that require added sugar. Our family of four consumes at least a pitcher of the tea every day in the summer, so one package lasts about one month.		Last summer, we purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hasegawa-Juhyo-Mugicha/dp/B0038KNYWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hasegawa Juhyo Mugicha</a>&nbsp;but it is currently unavailable at Amazon. It was good though, so I wrote a five-star review for that brand. The price was reasonable, less than $9.45 for 51 packs, or roughly 38 cents for a two-quart pitcher.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/House-Mugicha/dp/B001ATZOAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">House Mugicha</a>&nbsp;is about the same price, a five-package order costs $15.94 through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. Each pack contains 16 tea bags (each making one quart of tea), which comes out to 40 cents for a two-quart pitcher.		Rating: 5 stars.
0,Very good food product.
0,i LOVE s'mores so i had to get these. . .maybe im not over "gluten filled" foods but i didn't love these. I am going to make "gluten free girl's" recipe to make my own and see which ones are better. will update! thankful for them none the less.
0,GREAT!
0,So many delicious flavors so little time to eat them all.  I ill be mixing them between the other great flavors for this manufacturer. .
0,Over the last several years I've tried to decrease the pastas and rices that we eat at home and while I've done a very good job at it, I still find myself occasionally craving that well known cheesy blue-boxed pasta that I grew up on. While I'm not embarrassed to buy it at the grocery store, I wouldn't mind finding a more "adult" friendly version to keep on hand and this one may be it.  The flavor is better in my opinion because it is less artificial tasting.  It was as easy to prepare and while the cost is a bit more, I think I'd be okay paying it. Overall it's definitely worth a try and if you can buy a single box in your grocery store that would be even better.
0,Great taste!  Flavor lasts a long while; no aftertaste.  My favorite gum  :-D
0,Great price. Tons of tea. Nice to have on hand if you run out of loose leaf :)
0,Nabisco knew if they didn't put little things that give this much pleasure in little baglets, we would keep dipping our hand in the bag and in a couple years would all weigh 400 lbs, die an early death and no longer be able to give Nabisco money.		Kidding aside, these are loveable. The texture is perfection. If you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth.
0,I tried the Popcorners Natural Popped Corn Chips at a local warehouse store and immediately purchased a couple of the huge bags that were available at the time.  I've been a fan of Popcorners since I tasted my first chip on a JetBlue flight a few years ago, and after tasting this variety, no other can compare.  These are described as Sweet Chili, but they taste less sweet to me than even the original flavor.  The flavoring doesn't stain the hands and there is very little residue after eating a serving or two or three of the chips.  They are exceptionally crunchy and I personally like to find the broken ships because I like to pop them into my mouth at once and nice bite into a chip.  Because they are chips and are rather thin, they are easy to chew and soften because they are popped and not fried.  I personally find that it's safer in my household to have smaller bags because it's easier to control portions than by sticking a hand into a huge bag where I'm tempted to continue addition just one more at a time.  These are great and the flavor is the best, a little spicy and a little less sweet without tasting very salty.
0,Great quality product! Use it everyday in my protein shakes. One of the best natural foods for your body!
0,love it  fresh and great
0,Delicious and on time
0,Delicious! Should have bought a ton but I know I'll eat them all in one day >_>
0,Large amount, smells great, will add it to my herb rack.
0,Works great!  Use in breakfast.
0,I've been drinking Peet's Jasmine tea for years. Both the tea bag and the loose leaf are very good.
0,Potent!
0,Great product and very handy to have on hand for Mexican recipes.  Rick Bayless really knows his stuff.  I will definitely re-order this.
0,great spice with good flavor and aroma, Thank you
0,Great gluten free bread
0,cheap, good taste and i like this. and not too salty.
0,These oats taste just as good as Irish Oats.  The children like rolled oats; but they love steel cut oats.  They tell us they can taste the difference.  We will buy this again.
0,Tasty & healthy!  Hard to find locally. Good enough price as well.
0,Keep this around to use all the time, substituting for part or all of butter or other fat in recipes. And I bake a good bit and am rather picky, but very satisfied with results -- excellent texture, etc. Does have mild coconut/sweet taste, so if you don't want that, get refined coconut oil.
0,These are every bit as good as the ones in the little packs, though there are considerably more flavors in this jar than there are in the little retail zip packs.		We shipped these in a box via container from the USA to the Philippines, and the beans were perfect when they arrived.  The heat didn't damage them in the slightest, and the jars are nice and heavily-built with a good peel-seal that was pressurized at sea level, but not nearly enough to deform the package.		I'm going to buy another couple of these bad boys soon--they're too big of a hit to last 'round these parts.
0,Good coffee!!!
0,Another favorite, this rice smells like heaven when cooking.  More versatile than basmati rice, and a nice variety to have on hand.
0,great i will buy more
0,Recommend. High quality and tastes good.
0,a true beet eater with vingegar. every night I had my beets. very tasty buy them good in salads also
0,They very kindly and promptly sent another set with a great expiration date.  Thank you.  I love these and it was great to try the variety pack.
0,There's really not much to say here.  It's salt, a necessary kitchen staple.  You should probably get some.
0,Kids love having cocoa available, even when it's 110 degrees out!
0,My favorite eggs. Don't know why I like brown. I will warn you, because they are free chickens, not all the eggs will come out Kosher.
0,I like this product.  Came quickly when it was shipped - nice!
0,These bars are excellent! I've been eating these bars from the very first day I saw them! They're my first choice in the morning.
0,Flavorful dried cranberries much better than the brands I've bought at the grocery store. (Not sure what I'm going to do with this 4 pound box, though) Probably will need to bake a bunch of holiday cookies and breads!
0,These jumbo red vines seem to be softer and chewier than the skinnier ones that are packaged in boxes with plastic over wraps.  It is convenient to have these in bulk for home delivery.
0,I enjoyed the taste of these berries and use them  on my cereals at breakfast.
0,the best
0,My wife favorite
0,Tasty!
0,These are quite good although a bit too sweet.  They do satisfy the "snack" need.
0,Really yummy for a candy bar treat.  Not great for meal replacement as it is too heavy in fruit sugars to keep one full for long.  The nuts in it would probably make it bad for a pre- workout bar.  I usually eat them post work out .  I perceive them heavier on the raspberry flavor, not so much on the chocolate.  Not so good that I want to snack on them when I'm not hungry, which I consider a good thing.  Real food to nourish the body.  I like these much better than those really popular fruit and nut bars.  In a sweetness comparison these are much lower.  A definite keeper in my rotation.
0,Good coffee.
0,I wish they had no added sugar, otherwise they are good!
0,Pretty good for instant potatoes
0,After curing and brining with Kosher salt, Prague #1 and Dark Brown Sugar I smoked some turkey legs and they came out great. They were much better than the dried out turkey legs that you get in the store. My only complaint about the Curing Salt is that it is a bit expensive. A pound will last me forever, but it's still too much for what it is.
0,Great product. It doesn't have a heavy duty taste of chocolate but it works when I want to have a healthy snack without all the calories.
0,great organic coffee. not much more to say than that. will always buy again
0,Pretty and plenty!
0,I am a big almond fan and love Blu Diamond Natural Almonds. They arrived quickly and are fresh. The expiration is for well over a year from when they arrived. If your tired of paying the big box store prices for these than you have come to the right place.		Update:		I found one issue with this order which is not related to the quality of the product. One of the bags I received had been cut by a box cutter presumably in the warehouse. The almonds were still fresh so I just put them in a zip-lock bag. Hopefully shipping is a bit more careful next time.
0,The nuts were fresh tasting.  My wife and I have a couple each day.  I freeze them in  pound packs and pull them out as I need them.
0,Great value!
0,Tasty and easy to use.
0,Truly does detox skin. Skin is glowing. Beware of all the caffiene though. I drink 3 to 4 times day and that adds up. 18MG of caffeine per packet.
0,Love these Pop-Tarts!  Brings back great memories as a kid!  You are never too old for Pop-Tarts.  Great value and fast shipping through Amazon.
0,Great taste, nice sized bitess
0,Great for baking. Easy to measure and store.
0,Excellent product! I use it to make tea to treat gealth issues like IBS and headaches.  It has proven to effectively ease both for me. I tried another brand as well...for comparison, and this brand was fresher, more fragrant and works better to ease my ailments...particularly tje IBS!
0,This is the best coffee I have ever had in my 40+ years.  It was recommended from a co-worker who loves his coffee as I do.  The taste is bold but not too much.  Its a little earthy but in a very good way.  Its low acid which is also nice.  I do recommend grinding the beans very well so that you don't have any larger pieces.  The taste is better than anything you can buy in a store or make at home.  This is my new favorite!
0,Surprisingly yummy. I like to make hot chocolate from scratch but it's inconvenient so I got this instead & it is very tasty.
0,This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.		Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.	I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.		That being said...my favorite coffees are:		Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold	Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee	Newman's Own Extra Bold	Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold	Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti		and a special mention for	Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.		Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.		We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.	Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.		We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.		1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.		2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.		3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.		4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.
0,Used it to make chocolate icing!
0,I wish I could fin this in stores so I don't have to buy it online.
0,This is really yummy candy, need I say more?I would purchase this candy again. It tastes like when you bite into a fresh mango.:)
0,I am a power lifter and amateur nutritionist and normally I juice my own raw organic vegetables, but when I am rushed this is an excellent replacement. I have food allergies to artificial flavors and colors including MSG, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Xylitol, etc... Which are migraine triggers for me and this product has none of it. The Low Sodium type had a small taste issue but my taste buds adjusted and now I enjoy it.	My name is the same on the label but I have no affiliation with the producers. I'm simply writing this report because this is a product I enjoy. Also I am one of those health food nuts that won't eat anything inorganic or GMO.. (I hope your reading this Monsonato because you suck!!!)
0,My hubby's favorite.
0,great coffee
0,Excellent product and seller. Thank you.
0,We got these because my child is allergic to peanuts (but not other nuts) and he really wanted to be a part of eating energy bars at school. So these are made of pumpkin seeds, dates, apricots, almond butter, agave and salt. Again, not nut-free because of the almonds, but if you just have the peanut allergy these work great. They are a bit sticky and at almost 200 calories they are more like a meal than a snack for small kids, but they are organic and easy to pack in lunch bags.
0,It seems like I just hit the enter key on my order and it was on my doorstep.  Tried every flavor and each and every one was different and flavorful. Some flavored coffees are so overwhelming with the flavor you can't taste the coffee. Not this brand. Smart sips have a strong flavoring but the coffee is just as bold and between the two of then they balance out nicely.  Undoubtedly the best flavored coffee I've ever had and I've been drinking coffee for the past 50 years !
0,This is a great combination of Herbs.  And not only for bread, but veg., potatoes and soup/stews.  I have about 12 of their salt free blends and now would not care to cook without them.
0,I honestly bought this for the price.  But after trying it I find it is a nice breakfast coffee; mild, yet flavorful, without bitterness. A very good value.
0,We enjoy these more neutral flavoured crispbreads as they do not overpower anything we might put on them. As well, they do not break into bits in the box or in preparation, like so many gluten-free crackers. My grocery store source for these was inconsistent. Then they began to carry only the sun-dried tomato version. The sun-dried tomato crispbreads are fine, if that's what you want to taste... like if using with a cream cheese, complementary cheese or perhaps ham.	However, these plain ones are our favorites.
0,This Organic Golden White Quinoa by FreshGreen Health is so fresh and GREAT tasting!  It is also such a LARGE bag - Great value!  It was super easy for me to cook this quinoa.  I use organic chicken stock, and it only takes about 15 minutes to cook using the stove top.  It tastes great when I cook it this way, even my babies will eat it up!  I have also used the cooked quinoa to make "fried rice."  I cook it exactly the way I would cook fried rice, and you really can't tell the difference at all!  The BIG difference is that it is so much healthier to eat this quinoa "fried rice" then it is to eat regular fried rice.  I've also used this quinoa in soups!  I just love how versatile this food is!  Definitely would recommend to everyone!  So healthy, and tastes awesome!
0,As described. Fast shipping.
0,Great brand of avocado oil.  They periodically have this at Marshalls as well, but it's about the same price.		Great for cooking!  Much better than olive oil for slightly higher heat.
0,My mother is the only person I know who can make these to taste like this product....I cannot make Yorkshire Pudding from scratch....great for "Toad in the Hole " too.
0,I hate peanut butter with added sugar and do not like most natural peanut butters.  But I absolutely love Teddie!!  I live beyond the company's distribution range, but vacation every summer in New Hampshire, where I buy a bunch to bring home.  This year, I ran out well before vacation time and turned to Amazon.  The first thing I noticed is that Amazon's is much fresher than what I had been stocking.  If you have never tried Teddie, do yourself a favor!
0,excellent rice and I will keep buying it!
0,Loved it.
0,Hubby really likes 'em!
0,You can eat this bar slower by nibbling, which might help you eat less. It's satisfying taste. You get enough chocolate for that craving. It has nuts too, for those who want to have crunch. Most women would like this product due to the dark chocolate.
0,excellent
0,I pruchased 2 of these for hubby to snack on. He loves them. Gone in three days. Have to buy more next time.
0,Everything about this hazelnut Coffee-Mate order was great in my book. The order was well-packaged and arrived sooner than I thought it would. The product tastes fresh and it's convenient not having to refrigerate it. I like having a flavored coffee every once in a while, and this keeps me from wasting half a bottle or more because I can't use it before it goes bad. I look forward to buying it again when I finish this supply.
0,Okay, I hate to admit this but I really don't like Sriracha hot sauce...I don't use it for anything at all and I don't understand people who think it's wonderful lol.  This chili sauce isn't completely different yet it is somehow just different enough to be really good.  It is a simple taste, but with just the right combination of chilies, garlic and vinegar.  The consistency is a bit odd for this to be used as a topping (on eggs, pizza etc) so you may want to puree it if that's how you're going to use it, but as a cooking ingredient (specifically, as an addition to certain stir-fry dishes) it adds a wonderful flavor that nothing else replicates.  You could even use this to spice up some spaghetti sauce, add some to a pot of chili, etc.  Overall this is a fresh, tasty, versatile sauce that everyone should have in their fridge.
0,These are great. Too much sodium for me though. I wish it had less Sodium, I guess you can eat the noddle and just toss the juice.
0,I loved these.  They remind me of Frango Mints that I use to get in Seattle.  Smooth, rich and tasty.
0,Good taste.  As an old Postum drinker, this is the closest I have been able to find. I sometimes like a hot drink in the evening.  Nice to find one with no caffine that tastes good.
0,Very very good....Super impressed with flavor and texture. I have severe heartburn and I'm trying to wean myself off of acidic coffee, and this is been working quite well. I mixed about half coffee with half this and now I am only drinking this.
0,Great snack, not overly salty. Yummy party fare with bar-b-que sauce.
0,If you like dark coffee that is rich and not bitter this is the one.
0,My half-sister recommended these when I told her that I could not find a good paleo meat bar that I liked.  I have tried Epic, Chomps, Wild Zora, Trader Joe's brand, and a few others, and did not care for any of them.  Most bars out there are either way too dry and chewy, way too small, too gristle-y, and/or way too mushy.		Tanka bars are just right.  Not too big, not too small.  But where they really shine is in the quality of the meat.  There is no gristle, and hardly any visible fat globules like in other bars.  These have 1 gram of saturated fat - that's it.		These bars have an overall satisfying flavor and texture.  A bit on the bland side, but at least they are not overly salty or peppery or garlicky like some bars or sticks.  They are a little bit sweet due to the cranberries and a little added sugar.  And the texture is great - Moist but firm and not mushy.  A little bit greasy but nothing off-putting.  And there is no lingering unpleasant after-taste like most other bars or sticks I have tried.  You know, the kind where you have to reach for a cookie afterwards to wash the taste out of your mouth :).		Bottom line, I will definitely buy these again.  I have not re-purchased any of the others I tried.  I am curious to see if they come in flavors.  For now, I have these on Subscribe & Save.
0,Love it
0,These are delicious and so cheap! You will not be disappointed! I have had the most expensive ones, and these are juast as good. Also, the variety ones too. That include, chocolate sea salt, chipolte, butter creme, pomegranite, and other flavors. Amazing!
0,love for food and supplement
0,wonderful
0,I like these little cups.
0,product arrived on time and exactly as advertised.  I can not get this type of tea locally here in our small Texas town, so it was delightful to find it at such a good price at Amazon.
0,very good
0,Excellent
0,Another perfect healthy snack to add to your pantry... no guilt snacking!
0,Cook's Illustrated was right again.  Best tahini that I have ever used.
0,I was a bit hesitant to purchase a whole package of 6 of the White Bean & Pasta soup since I'd never tried it before, but I'm glad I did!  I really enjoy the nice mix of flavors and it really helps to keep me full at work for lunch.  The pasta isn't mushy and the white beans are tender.  I will purchase this again.
0,Hershey's Miniatures Assortment, 40-Ounce Bag is delicious! I need some more NOW !!!
0,Had these before and I love them.  I get them every month.
0,Love the taste of these wraps and I have used them in a number of dishes.  My favorite is frying some onions in coconut oil, adding ground beef until brown then adding some organic sugar free salsa and letting it cook for 15 minutes.  Adding this mixture on top of these wraps along with a few spoons of avocado makes a great meal and it's completely paleo and gluten free.  I was initially thinking that one wrap is not strong enough to hold the meat mixture, but to my surprise one wrap is enough and it holds everything just fine without falling apart.	The texture of the wraps is as expected coconut like and it's adds a great flavor to a number of dishes such as breakfast wraps with eggs and sausage, etc.
0,Yummy.
0,My Favorite!
0,Addicting !!
0,Good
0,If you love dark chocolate and coconut, this is something for you! I am in love with these. Kashi makes really good and healthy products. All of their poducts that I have tried have been good, but these are by far my favorite.
0,This is one of the best seasonings we've ever used (and there have been many we've sampled over the decades). BBQ champion John Willingham's creation has been difficult to find in recent years, so we were delighted to find it available through Amazon. Be sure to try it if it's new to you. It's delicious on any kind of.meat, no matter how it's cooked, so don't save it just for your next barbecue.
0,Very pleased with this order. Will buy again
0,I am not a big coffee fan but I wanted a Keurig maker. I absolutely love Chai Latte. I make two cups of it. I found that mixing it on the middle setting and one on the smallest cup setting mixed together makes it a perfect combination! It tastes just like when I used to buy it for 3x the price. It is creamy and the right amount of flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice kick of flavor in the morning but ins't looking for the caffeine of coffee! I also enjoy this as a little treat since I am watching my weight and this doesn't make a big dent into the amount of calories I consume a day. I did wish I could find i for less expensive on Amazon as my local store has it for a better price but it is not always in stock.
0,Very nice easy open can.  Fixes my sweet-tooth, too.
0,It seems odd to review hershey's chocolate.  It is a wonderful chocolate with a variety of smooth chocolate, some with almonds and one with a crunch to it.
0,Quick delivery. Quality product. As described completely
0,The peanuts came promptly and are of excellent quality
0,Love this flavor.
0,Very good product.  Fresh.  Delicious.  I will buy again.
0,Surely one of the best finds  in food.  Forget about the old pasta.  This replaces it.
0,love this microwave instant popcorn in it's own bucket, easy quick to cook and serve in the paper bucket it comes in.
0,Good as usual.never disappoints.
0,This is the best candy from Japan.  It tastes like creamy milk, and it's chewy like caramel.  Back in Japan, I think the tagline they use translates to "Just like Mom used to make."  haha.  Anyways, I highly recommend it to people who like vanilla, caramel and creamy candies.
0,Chocolate and mint always a good combination.  This particular brand of this candy is more chocolatey than minty.  It's not a problem, just different than the ones I usually eat.
0,Good flavor, not too fruity - I use it all the time for cooking! It's one of the better value big-container olive oils out here on Amazno and will be purchasing again!
0,I bought several flavors of Altoids, and so far we like them all.  They are an effective breath mint, but they are also a nice alternative to grabbing a handful of calories when the sweet tooth tries to take over.
0,Much better buy than even BJS or anywhere else.  They are whole and came fast.  Nice.  You should get them
0,Good product!
0,Update: Had to dock this one star.  The cost went from $18 to $26 over night.  Still great coffee.		This is the best coffee for the price, IMO.  There are other brands that are higher quality, but not at this price.  We drink a lot of coffee, so this is a great product for us.  Love the prime shipping.
0,love green tea.....helps with colds, and body aches too!...will buy again!
0,Very nice.
0,Delicious and nice texture, but ingredients are not all natural or I would give it 5 stars.
0,Good item would buy again
0,I really enjoy this coconut water.  Tastes fresh and has good nutrition with no added ingredients.  I usually put it in our morning smoothies along with some strawberries, bananas and flaxmeal.
0,Bob's Red Mill offers an Organic Brown Flaxseed Meal.  This one is not organic according to the labeling information.  If you're interested enough in your health to be eating this stuff, that distinction may be noteworthy to you.  It is for me.
0,Best chocolate ever. I got this for my husband's birthday (For the man who really has everything), He loved it. The taste and quality were superb. The sizes perfect, the condition excellent.  Will be buying from this seller again.
0,Great ingredients, taste, and company. I wish they were organic, but natural is an upgrade over conventional and the ingredient list is superior to any name brand.
0,This is a pretty good organic ground cumin that's fragrant, ground uniformly and tastes like many others I've used. I'm not sure of the country of origin as it's not listed on the labels, but it is organic. I usually purchase my spices and dried herbs at Penzeys in smaller amounts but have received some directly from India to try.  I find this large plastic jar with large holes for shaking to be cumbersome for use at home, so I'm using it in smaller jars in a preblended form so that I don't have to grab am assortment of spices I regularly use for more spontaneous seasoning.  It's a mild cumin that lemme itself well to blending.
0,love the flavor, a little alcoholy
0,The moca has a slight chocolate favor that is mild and tasty. Great with cream. These herbal teas are much better for sensitive stomachs than some other barley mixed herbal teas I have tried. Highly Recommend.
0,These are so delicious...crunchy and smooth at the same time, that once I begin eating one I want to finish the whole package (3). I can only buy them once a year.  Be careful!
0,Very good grader for me because it comes out like a fine powder.
0,Tasty and good flavor.
0,Fast delivery! Item as described, 5 stars, many thanks!
0,love the taste
0,these are great to take to work.
0,Great tasting and healthy
0,Ideal for those good biscuits that most know that come from a famous restraunt.  VERY easy to make, yummy.  I add some garlic to melted butter and brush this over the biscuits while the are still hot.  I will order more before my last package is used.  Thanks.!!
0,Perfect for The Dukan Diet.
0,Lots of people have already reviewed these variety packs, so I'll try to make this useful. The packaging is as others have described and you can see some user uploaded photos of the type of boxes they use. The ones I got actually have a large red ribbon design printed on them, so they could be given as gifts without even wrapping. The boxes have the individual wells for the cups, so that they are securely held in place. If you are ordering from Crazy Cups, this is what you will get. Any other seller, you are taking your chances.		As for the coffee variety, I see that people have had different experiences over time. I ordered mine about a month ago, and all 70 cups were unique. There were flavored coffees, some iced coffees, a couple of ciders, mochas, and other specialty variations. The roasts range from mild to super bold. I think I may have gotten only one or two decaf cups, which is a shame because I like to drink coffee at night, too, and decaf just makes more sense to me. Thankfully there are a wealth of reviews for every brand you can buy here on Amazon and I had no problem figuring out which decaf to get!		One thing to consider with a variety sampler like this is the fact that you will get mild, medium, and dark roasts, in cups that vary in content amount, which in a standard Keurig means that your brewed cup will vary in intensity because you cannot adjust the amount of water it brews per cup. If you have a multi-brew machine like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BUNN-MCU-Single-Cup-Multi-Use-Brewer/dp/B009PLQ5H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BUNN MCU Single Cup Multi-Use Brewer</a>&nbsp;you do have the option of varying the amount of water that brews, from 4 to 14 oz. so you can still control how mild or how strong the resulting cup is.
0,This Onion Power is very fine, almost like baby powder but it has a great flavor and aroma.  I love the fact that it is also organic.  This is a great value for the money!
0,We like Great River Organic Milling.  We have ordered several different products from them.  All have been top notch, and we love the fact that they are organic.  This is the first flour that my WHOLE family likes.  It is not to "wheaty" for my husband and children.  Our baked goods come out way better.  We can even use this to make muffins and cookies.  We will be ordering this from here on out.  We appreciate the large size, since we go through it really fast.
0,Love it love it love it. SPICY, perfect to add spice to my causes without the uncertaintly and bother of grinding fresh jalapenos in my food processor.
0,I bought my first bag in a store that is not close to home, and have not been able to find them locally... And then I thought of Amazon, and of course they had it!!!  It's a good value too (I paid about a dollar more per bag in the store).  The rice is very tasty and has a chewy/nutty flavor.  It's delicious and healthy too!
0,Great taste, high protein, low sugar.
0,I used to use Maseca but since the corn they use is gmo I got this masa. It must be healthier but the tortillas are not as fluffy and yummy. But then, I rather be healthy with this tortillas than the yummy and fluffy gmo ones....
0,Oh my goodness! This is so much fun and super yummy!  I purchased this Chocolate Drizzled Pretzels Pizza Pie from Oh! Nuts for my twin nieces.  I always bring them a little something when I go to visit them.  You should've seen their faces when I handed them this!		First of all, I guess is am a poor judge of measurement and I was expecting this to be smaller than it is.  This thing is huge!  It is loaded with all the yumminess a child can stand.  Or, I should say, a child at heart can stand!  My nieces are crazy for Gummy Bears and I love nonpareils and this is covered with them both!  It is drizzled all over with white chocolate.  And is there anything better than that salty and sweet combination?		This Chocolate Pretzel Pizza is a feast for the eyes!  The girls couldn't stop staring and pointing at everything on top.  This pizza serves at least 16 people and they will all be more than satisfied!  The pizza arrived beautifully boxed.  Perfect for gift giving.  I know for sure that I am their favorite aunt now!		I received this product at a discount in exchange for writing a review based on the results of my testing it. I am not affiliated with this company and I did not promise to write a positive review when the offer was made. I tested this product thoroughly and do my best to provide detailed reviews to other Amazon customers so they may make informed decisions about their future purchases.

0,My nephew puts ketchup on everything. I always have to have an extra bottle on hand.
0,Good
0,I recently started back at work after 12 weeks of maternity leave, and noticed that my supply was slowing getting less and less each time I pumped at work. I was down to getting about 4-5oz total, after double pumping. I had to pump in the morning and before I went to bed to make up the difference for what baby needed at daycare the next day.	A few days after I started drinking this, I noticed my supply increase quickly. I now get about 7-9oz total per pumping session, and two double pumping sessions easily make enough for the next day. Its such a relief not having to panic about whether she'll have enough food for daycare.	I think the taste is fine. I like the taste of licorice (anise) but I don't really notice it in the tea. You can smell it in the bag, but the taste isn't too strong. I brew it with a bag of pomegranate green tea, which helps to enhance the flavor.
0,Fresh & good
0,I drink this tea a lot and have already ordered more
0,OMG.  Best stuff ever.  The variety pack takes care of your cravings for chocolate and cookie.  Yummm... Be careful!  You and your spoon will not be able to stay away.
0,This is great coffee for caps in the afternoon
0,Spicy pretty much sums it up.  If you like a good sharp ginger beer, you'll love Prince of Peace Instant Ginger Honey Crystals.  I trade the convenient packets at work for pretzels when necessary... otherwise my hoard is stashed within my ultra-sweet cubicle cabinet.  Office dweller nectar.
0,Very tasty energy crunchy bites. I enjoy them and will order again.
0,Great mix of nuts, NO PEANUTS!!!
0,When I first began looking for an all natural cat food and found this brand, I chose 3 different flavors with this one being one of them.  My 16-year-old male cat just devours this one in one setting.  The others he always leaves some uneaten but not this one!  I have noticed too that the dry flaky skin he had is no more which is so nice on a black coat.  I think I am leaning towards giving him just this one flavor because he loves it so much and won't shut up until I fill his plate every morning.  Thank you Natural Value for such a great product for our pets!
0,Very good taste if you like Cajun
0,Great variety to get a taste of many flavors. Peanut butter & co, for a better price than the local store.
0,This is the real deal.  Raw unprocessed sea salt.  It has at least 80 other minetals and nutrients in it.	If you dissolve it, there is rral sand in it but thats where your nutrients come from.	This stuff tastes good and doesn't affect blood pressure like processed iodized salt does
0,Really mellow coffee at a really good price.  Highly recommended.  Even politically correct!
0,Great cup of coffee
0,Love this product and company.
0,The best peanut butter I have ever eaten. I love the fact that I can make it whatever consistency I like simply by adding more or less water. I created a simple protein shake of my own devising.		Simple Peanut Butter Protein Shake		One Cup Soy Milk	One 1" slice of Firm Tofu	Two tablespoons of this peanut butter		Add soy milk and tofu to blender and blend until liquid.	Add peanut butter and blend again just to mix.		Protein is 21g. Calories 245.		Note: do not substitute some other type of vegetarian milk as it won't give enough protein. Also, use firm or extra firm tofu because softer tofu makes the shake too runny and also because it has less protein.		This can be made in bigger batches and stored for up two 48 hours.
0,I took the first package as a straight soup.		It really packs a flavor punch!  I can see this would make excellent gravy and such.
0,The Nongshim line of soups is a viable alternative to Annie Chun's.  You get the Nongshim for about half the price of Annie Chun.  Why the difference?  Well, it is mostly the noodles.  With Annie Chun you get soft udon style noodles that come to you soft and just need heating.  With Nongshim you get dried noodles that need to soak in hot water for a while - rather like cup o' noodles.  Still, the Nongshim product is a quantum leap ahead of anything like cup o' noodles.  In actual fact, I find the flavor and texture to be competitive (to my tastebuds) to the Annie Chun product.  Your mileage may vary, depending on your budget.
0,Yummy wish I had some now
0,If you didn't know they were low carb then you'd never know.  Most low carb products taste ok but these are really good.  I am so glad I found these!  Wish this company made more items.
0,Delicious!!!
0,I have tried many commercially-available fish sauces, Aside from cooking uses, I love putting a drop or two on my tongue, swill it around and enjoy the tastes..obviously salt hit first, then fish.  This product does not list sugar in it's ingredients.  A good buy.
0,Excellent product.
0,love it
0,What a great taste, just love them.
0,Yummy.  Not tough like the jerky my husband prefers.
0,So sinfully good you'd think it has a bunch of calories, but it doesn't. Go ahead, indulge. And make it with skim milk for some added richness.
0,Let's just say...this didn't last more than a day in my house. Sour and cream is always a favorite of mine.
0,Gum tastes like cake. Very sweet yet  sugar free. Enjoying this gum as well as other flavors.
0,LOVED THESE.  Im addicted.  Had to order more
0,We love flavored coffee's and this brand just whiffs from the coffee maker all over the house, it just makes us feel good just smelling it and the taste is excellent.  Highly recommend!
0,Simply Organic is simply fresh and great tasting! These are actually less expensive than my grocery store organic brand. Nice sized jar with both shaker and pour plastic cap under the lid. I am replacing all my old spices with these. It's worth it for the great fresh taste.
0,Very tasty I purchase often.
0,After reading about the dangers of many store bought cinnamon products, decided to try this.  It does taste a little different but it is good and a much healthier alternative.  We use it every day.
0,This is on subscription, enough said!
0,Can't be beat for a quick breakfast food.
0,Great
0,Very good flavor! I would buy again!
0,Very tasty and low calorie, but you can get as good a deal in your local supermarket.
0,love it but way to hot for me .my sons love it.
0,This granola mix is delicious. My allergist is currently trying to figure out exactly what I'm allergic to (developed allergies to something I consume, apparently routinely) over the past few months. In the meantime, I am staying away from common allergens.  This granola has not caused me any negative reactions.  I am purchasing the larger bag as well as other GERBS products, as the first too items purchased have sat well with me over the past week.
0,love the taste and I will buy more wend ,we need
0,The spray mechanism on this bottle is reason enough to get this - it's fantastic!! and the oil is great to cook with - high smoke point so good for roasting.
0,Yummy
0,I bought the Mountainside Variety Pack, and it was super convenient to have it delivered to my house. I'm a fairly new purchaser of Bai drinks and previously only tried the coconut. Three of the flavors were really good (molokai coconut, ipanema pomegranate, and panama peach), but the tanzania lemonade tea tasted too acidic and sour to me, even when I added water for a half and half combination. If I buy more, I'll just stick with flavors I've already tried and like. It's too expensive to waste 25% of the pack.
0,I love peanut butter
0,OMG theses are delicious!! Smaller than I expected, but they still lasted me a while (longer than I expected for the size). I would say definitely worth it, but I recently stopped by a store that sells candy in bulk and it said $3.59 for 1lb of licorice wheels compared to $8?!! So I'm not sure...
0,This is a great tasting rice, and I like the size of it, also the price is good!!!!
0,My husband loves this cereal.  It's not always worth buying it on Amazon so I watch the prices to be sure it's worth it.  With the Subscribe & Save and grouping my orders to get the best discount, it helps the pricing.
0,Very good.  Love these crackers with cheese.
0,If you have lived in Mainland China, you would know that it's almost impossible to get clean food, let alone organic and/or all-natural food.  How this maker can ensure that is beyond me.  But let's give them the benefit of doubt for now, shall we?  The noodle pack size is way too light/small.  It's like 1/2 the portion of regular instant noodle.  The noodles tastes quite chemical-free to my sensitive tongue, that's good.  Aftertaste was minimal, that's good.  Soup base pack is a lil' on the salty side, noodles didn't absorb the flavor too well.  At this time, I may not re-order...
0,Love the taste!! will order again.
0,I do love the smell, the way it mixes (as it does dissolve in cold or warm/hot water you just have to whisk it or put it in a shaker for iced cold), however, I've tried it in so many ratios, with different milks, with different teas, etc, and I can't get it to taste quite like the super creamy cookies and cream flavor that taro root tastes like. I'm talking real taro root. The boba shop I go to has a mix that tastes as close to real taro as can be, and to me, even fresh taro root tastes like cookies and cream. It's seriously my fav. root veggie ever! Anywho, it's still very good though. You definitely can dilute it a lot with coconut milk, and tea and still have a very sweet and flavorful drink.
0,I like it. Nice hot kick.
0,The only cold cereal I can say I truly love!
0,I learned from my mother to use marjoram, thyme, and bay leaves when cooking a roast. I am now 71 and I still use marjoram, thyme, and bay leaves when cooking a roast. But the price of meat has gone through the ceiling,and I have had one roast so far this year. I am mostly living on beans and grain, a combination which provides a complete protein with very little fat. Unfortunately, herbs and spices which are not used up within about half a year lose a lot of flavors. I threw this out a few weeks ago, still mostly full. If I could afford roasts I would order this frequently. Under the present circumstances, I buy the very small supermarket bottles. But I have given this 5 stars because I hope you use enough marjoram for this to be worth buying.
0,Very nice alternative to coffee. Coffee hurts my tummy these days, including decaf. This non-coffee doesn't hurt at all, and tastes amazingly like coffee. I add a touch of Coffee Mate and I'm back in coffee heaven. Thanks!
0,I use these egg whites as one ingredient to make a whipped soap topping on my Cupcake Bubble Bath Bombs.
0,.Best almond flour I've used, super fine, works great for power pancakes
0,I like to top this with berries fresh or frozen and top off with a little of their pumpkin flax seed granola and some Vietnamese cinnamon. I don't add a lot of water. Microwave and it's as good as cobbler for breakfast.
0,Absolutely delicious way to get your fiber and low on sugar is another plus!
0,I really like the convenience of having these around and the expiration date is far enough out (at least on the case I got), that we used it all long before. But the cost is high. The milk is very good. I keep hoping for an un-homogenized version or at least cream in a box.
0,OK coffee, seems fresh but I found it a little bitter and acidic. I purchase a lot of coffee from Kauai, HI and just didn't find this to be as good, could just be my own personal preference.
0,A favorite around here! With both kids and adults -- especially excellent as someone else mentioned if you eat them from the fridge -- Yum! The vanilla cookie/cracker with creme de cocoa filling are also excellent!
0,I finally made the dish I wanted it for, it wax excellent.
0,ok
0,Use to make homeade baby formula.
0,Very good java..
0,Not that many cashews, but nuts are good quality
0,I use chicken stock in my wok cooking and chicken soup recipes. So I buy powdered bouillon in the large container. Both are full flavored and low in calories. I like that there is no fat content. I did use a larger amount than the directions call for because I like a potent flavor. Bouillon is saltier and limits enhancing the flavor.		This is a new brand for me and I wouldn't hesitate to buy when this container is used up.
0,Love these
0,I usually get this for people as a gift around the Holidays. It's a bit pricey, but fair. People know the Ghiradelli brand so it's a good gift.
0,got this for use with my SodaStream and that machine is SO much better than dealing with cans all the time
0,Great price and my kids love it
0,One of my favorite Keurig blends. A bit more expensive than some others but worth it for a treat. Like the San Francisco bay blend for everyday.
0,I LOVE this stuff...so healthy.
0,ty
0,Sardines packed in oil (soy, olive and EVOO) are too bland for me. I've tried them with green chilies, chipotle and Louisiana hot sauce. These Vigo are hotter than the others, but not by much. I kick it up a notch with Tabasco Habanero or Jalapeno sauce. If you like 'em midly hot, these may be just right for you.
0,AWSOME
0,All the kind bars are delicious. I love that I can get them on Amazon.
0,Move over popcorn!  This is one of the best movie snacks ever!  Crunchy, salty, and sweet.  Portion before you start - you won't stop until it's all gone!
0,I started eating these when I lived in Korea, then was so happy to find them in Japan, then in the US.  They are pretty spicy, but if you love kimchi and fish-based Asian foods, then you should like these too.  Korean udon (thicker noodles like these) and ramyun are the BEST!	I also add other ingredients: rehydrated Shiitake mushrooms, tofu, shrimp or frozen seafood, more seaweed, etc.  These noodles really hit the spot on a cold night!
0,BEST GUMMY CANDIES "EVERRRRRR" ADDICTING!!!
0,Tastes just like the rest. Assorted flavors. Very soft, haven't had any laxative issues.
0,Big bold strawberry flavor.  Highly addictive.  Love the fact they are individually wrapped so they stay fresh.  Just throw a few in your bag for a quick snack
0,full of flavor, worth every dime
0,I order these chips frequently.  I have found that these chips are consistent within each order.  BUT THERE ARE MAJOR BETWEEN ORDER VARIATIONS.  This batch is more browned and oily than the previous order.  One batch is saltier than the next.  I usually can do a direct comparison of the new order versus the previous one.  This reflects inconsistent quality control. You get what you get.
0,Very fresh.  It was a gift.
0,Delicious. The best one of the bunch
0,Arrived on time. Item as expected
0,my daily drink
0,These Dutch Caramel Wafers are delicious and make an excellent treat with coffee or tea.  You can warm them over your cup, in a microwave, or even dunk them if you like.  One or two are satisfying enough, I find.  This is pure decadence and a lot of sugar, so one must use discretion. I received some of these as a gift and enjoyed them so much I came here looking for more - so that speaks for itself.  Enjoy!
0,I really like this coffee and it is nice to be able to get it from amazon. Always fresh and nice tasting (for the price).
0,my favorite tea!
0,A very nice cup of coffee first thing in the morning.. sure makes my day! And the ease of useing my Keurig makes it even better. I especially like the ability to order from Amazon.com in a large enough quantity that I only have to order it once every 6 weeks or so. A winning situation as I see it!	Maggi
0,really like this for use in smoothies and cooking, almost a powder it so fine, but it works and has no sweetener.
0,Very happy with product.
0,These deserve the good reviews.  Very good taste and texture.  Just add water to mix and then cook them.  The list of ingredients is one that you can actually read!
0,I am all about finding healthy snacks lately. Nuts are full of healthy fats, but it's easy to eat too many of them. By eating them in a bar, the number of nuts you eat is more carefully controlled -- there's no bag to go dipping your hand back into. The nuts in this bar also add some protein (6 grams per bar).		Dark chocolate has a lot of antioxidants, but too much of the chocolate out there is high in sugar. This bar stands apart in that it has only 5 grams of sugar, but 7 grams of fiber (that's 28% of your daily allowance of fiber!).		I was a little unsure of whether I'd like the chili aspect of this bar (represented by three different types of ground hot peppers) but it actually worked. It wasn't too noticeable when eating the bar, itself, but it did give a little bit of a kick. (It did not burn my mouth or anything like that. The level was just right for me, and there is plenty of fat in the bar for absorbing the effects of the capsaicin from the hot peppers.)		Perhaps because of the low sugar content, this was not too sweet. It was a little salty at times, but at a good level for me -- not too much (there are 115 mg of sodium per bar). I thought all the flavors really worked well together, overall.		The total calories (200) and calories from fat (130, equal to 15 g or 23% of your daily allowance, including 3.5 g of saturated fat) were a high for a small snack; however, these bars still have a place in a healthy diet if you're consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables at other times of the day. I certainly don't know how you could reduce the fat and calories in these without making them much smaller or adding a bunch of filler. (The actual bar has all natural ingredients and no filler.)		Please note this contains peanuts, tree nuts, and dairy. It is, however, gluten free.
0,We like this yogurt
0,This coffee smells amazing, in the bag and in the cup.
0,These have replaced our purchases of monster energy drinks.
0,This is a must have for the kitchen. It's wonderful on prime rib, pork chops, chicken, soups, stews and my Godson's favorite, garlic bread with mozzarella cheese on it. We all love it. Even my father who does not like garlic, likes this with the many herbs and spices added to it.
0,If you like Red Bull then how can you go wrong with that. I don't drink energy drinks often but it is nice to keep some in the mini-fridge for when I need a little extra juice.
0,These are the best! Real chocolate flavor- not sweet.
0,Decided to give this stuff a try after seeing all the ads with Christopher Walken.  Hey, if Christopher Walken is in it, it has to be good, right? ;)  Anyway, I decided on the Mountainside variety pack for, variety.  My first thought upon cracking open one is "WOW!  The flavor steps right up and slaps you it's so good!"  The flavors are different but in a very good way and surprisingly very sweet considering the sweeteners used.  These are so refreshing that when they're ice-cold, I can pretty much drink one non-stop and then go back for another.  I have no guilt doing that since they only have 5 calories each.  I've signed up to have a case delivered every month.  I thought about going for two cases a month but decided against it.  I can't keep two cases in my refrigerator and I'd be tripping over the second case until it was time to go in the cold box.  They sure wouldn't be going to waste; I could easily drink two cases a month!
0,Good stuff! Starts my day with a tasty drink and even under sells our local walmart. Thank you for providing me a necessary staple of my diet and not fleecing me in the process You have a monthly customer for life.
0,Drink this as my breakfast a few times a week and it is great. Sometimes I'll have it a couple times a day if I'm busy. 2.0 tastes much better than the powder you mix yourself and tastes like the leftover milk after you have Cheerios in the morning. My wife doesn't care for it, but I love it, so YMMV.
0,This is awesome summer sausage. I can't eat pork and all beef summer sausage is expensive and not always easy to find, so I was glad to see this. I went back and bought more and will buy more in the future. It tastes great, not greasy at all.
0,yummmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!
0,We love the Kirkland brand although wish all of their products had grass-fed, non GMO or organic alternatives.
0,Sons said it is like drinking a Jolly Rancher candy, almost addictive!
0,what i needed
0,great product
0,I read that artificial sweetener aren't bad for everyone, as long a you don't succumb to eating dessert non-stop.  The writer suggested that only some people shouldn't use it.  The article said to have none for two weeks.  If you feel the same, then you arne't allergic to them.  IF you feel better without the sweetener, then you may be allergic to it and need you avoid it.
0,mmmmm
0,I like this dark Stevia even better than the clear that I have been using.
0,I saw this reviewed in Urbanette Magazine so I bought it. Super delicious tea. Evokes a cozy feeling. :)
0,I demand that you mix this with rice, then boil it in a wok until all the liquid is gone.  It is delicious and glorious.		Also goes well with angel hair pasta, or ... you know, with nothing, because it's delicious.
0,good flavor.
0,Fresh and good
0,Good for all foods.
0,If you need a change from the same old coffee or tea, you should try this drink. It is a delightful change !
0,Very mild flavor.  Slight hint of special sauce
0,The item was package very well and arrived on time. Exactly as described. I have used other brands of Xylitol but decided to try this brand since it was non-GMO.  I love the fact that it taste just like real sugar and has no after taste like other products.
0,These taste great.  I bought them to keep them in my office.  Just be sure to open them on, and eat them over, something like a large napkin or plate because crumbs shatter everywhere.  Much more so than a crispy cookie.  Personally, I would not eat them anywhere where clean up is problematic.  Also, they were just a tad crunchy for my taste.  But as granola bars go, they get high marks.
0,I bought this ti make Icecream with. So far it has done the trick and everybody loves the icecream we make.
0,Great taste, much better than conventional grown brazil nuts
0,They're fine- basic Tootsie Roll sucker flavors with fruit rolls in the middle.  As expected.
0,Not as good as I thought for the price and the small bottle.  I think I will stick with my $30 a bottle balsamic and truffle oil separately.
0,Fast delivery and item was as promised
0,I take Coconut Oil for health reasons, which has actually worked!  I've lost weight even without exercising, albeit slow.  Now, I'll try exercising.........maybe!	I like Barlean's coconut oil better than others because it tastes best.
0,convenience, and taste good
0,Arrived quickly and tastes amazing - like we remember!
0,Good taste and and quick to make.
0,The only Pop-tarts I'll eat... because they are delicious.
0,These chips are good: rich and crunchy. The sweet potato flavor is there but not too strong and they are nicely salted without being too salty. One fifth of a bag (13 chips) provides 35% of your saturated fat RDA, so Id avoid eating the whole bag at once if I were you! This serving size also provides 90% of your RDA for vitamin A and 12% of your fiber (see pic below). Compare that to some other sweet potato chips, where the main ingredient is corn, and the vitamin A content is more like 10%. Sweet potatoes are very good for you, with anti-inflammatory benefits, and also control of blood sugar. The medium chain saturated fatty acids in coconut oil are also attracting a lot of attention health-wise and I especially like that these chips are slow-cooked at lower temperatures. The unsaturated fat in regular vegetable oil can generate free radicals when exposed to high heat during extraction or high-temperature cooking, which can cause aging and cancer.		Overall Ill give Jacksons Sweet Potato Chips 5/5 gold stars for quality of the product and also 4/5 green stars based on the social-environmental aspects of producing it (see below).		Organic coconut oil has a significantly lower environmental impact than soy or corn oil grown in the US. The sweet potatoes are not organic, which is a shame. Sweet potatoes are generally a pretty sustainable crop (water, fertilizer, and pesticide needs; yield) depending on how they are grown. Jacksons Honest are not very transparent about the operations  they don't provide much information on the social and environmental impact of their company and suppliers (for example, a CSR report). They are a new company, so hopefully that will change over time. However, in profiles on the company I did see statements to the effect that they source potatoes from small family farmers that use biodynamic or organic practices (they do have a line of organic regular potato chips). They have a charitable foundation that serves to educate people about nutrient-rich foods. The larger 5 oz. bags are preferable since they involve less packaging than the 1.5 oz. bags.
0,I enjoy Sumatra as much as French Roast, and use them interchangeably.  When I lived in Indonesia, the natives brew it in the morning, drank it hot with sugar, then drank it cold with sugar all day long.  With such heat close to the equator it is a picker-upper.		I enjoy Indonesian or African coffee better than South American  or Kona coffee, because South American coffee tastes acid to me, and Kona coffee is too mild.		I gave it a 4 star because you have to taste the real freshly ground Sumatra coffee to truly enjoy it.		Janet Tien
0,Excellent long shelf life for salad! Nice and crisp and excellent for making my favorite Greek salad!
0,awesome
0,The only peanut butter I use now.
0,good quality good taste	good vanilla flavor
0,Kamut, when cooked, has a nice chewy texture.  Taste is delicious.  Pleasant in salads or as a side dish.
0,My favorite stone ground mustard: just wish the local chain carried it still, because the price is a little steep.
0,I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the grapefruit which I ordered from Amazon Fresh as while I'd ordered frozen and canned items, this was my first experience with fresh items.  Next time I'll order more fresh produce.
0,delicious
0,Delicious, fresh.
0,Great tasting product with low calories. I switch off between the 12 ounce bottle cases, and larger size, If you don't mind the calories, the regular flavors are fantastic, but I prefer the low cal version. One of the best tasting "diet" drinks out there! Enjoy.
0,So I expected an 8 oz jar and when I got the little 5 oz jar I was SO disappointed!  Then I opened it and tasted - oh my goodness!  This is the BEST. pistachio butter I have ever tasted. It is so smooth and creamy that it is a perfect addition to ice cream. This is worth every penny and really packs the rich flavor into this little jar. If you don't like the grittier butters, this one is for you. I've been eating mine with a spoon, right out of the jar. Delicious!
0,BEST PB I'VE USED. THERE IS NO SALT ND NO SUGAR IN THIS PEANUT BUTTER. HOWEVER, IT HAS EVIDENTLY SAT ON THE SHELF SO LONG THAT IT TAKES A MAJOR EFFORT TO MIX IT UP, WHICH I'VE NEVER DONE COMPLETELY.  MAYBE THE JARS SHOULD BE ROTATED (TUR;NED UPSIDE DOWN) FREQUENTLY FOR EASE IN MIXING. OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S THE FINEST QUALITY AND BEST TASTE. OF ANY PEANUT BUTTER I'VE USED.
0,it is what it says
0,expen$ive stuff but if it gets me through flu season...
0,BEST protein bars on the market.  You can easily mistake this for a candy bar, it IS that good!!! The flavors are outstanding, so far the vanilla is my favorite.  I keep one in my purchase in case I need a pick me up, and this satisfies my sweet tooth.  A definite if you're on a higher protein diet, this fills the bill.
0,Perfect for my raw key lime pie.  It's strong, so I cut the amount by about a third.  I haven't seen ANY key limes in our local stores this year, so having this juice was heaven sent.
0,strong
0,Came in a timely fashion as described.  Everyone in the family loves these and we feel very noble in eating them because of the healthy almonds.  We may be fooling ourselves; however, we will continue to enjoy them.
0,This is my "special tea" that I use to pamper myself or friend(s) when I want a whole pot of tea.  I use the paper tea bags you fill yourself to seep in a pot of hot water or use my K-cup.
0,Very very good if you like cinnamon starts out with a STRONG cinnamon flavor but then finishes with sweet cinnamon. Also can't find these any where else, just like the green apple ones.
0,Worth the money.
0,DELICIOUS! We love these.
0,Very tasty. Plump & moist figs, will buy again!
0,Good quality coffee.
0,Mix it with water and spray it on my hair. Good amount for the price!
0,These pickled okra are the best I have found anywhere.  They are not very hot, but very tasty.  A bit expensive, but having 6 big jars of these is great.  We average a jar per week.  If you like pickled okra you will love these!
0,So good! Freshly sealed. No complaints.
0,Great smooth taste!! Will definitely buy more!!
0,I put them on the counter at work for the employees. They are a favorite.
0,THATS ALOT OF NUTS
0,Good coffee to wake up with
0,Love, love, love this coffee.  However, it is not for the faint of heart.  It is strong, robust and rich.  I did not find it bitter at all, which often happens with dark roasts, even when I made an espresso drink using too much of the coffee.  I  have tried dozens of coffees, almost all whole bean which I grind myself and this one ranks with my top three.  The coffee is organic to boot and freshly roasted.  None of this sitting around for months like the stuff you buy in grocery stores.
0,Excellent quality oil. I add this to coffee and golden milk all the time. GREAT flavor and very little processing. Even tastes great eating it straight. We keep this in stock all the time now.
0,These capsules taste the same as the espresso capsules and are about half the price
0,Original German/Swiss mix. If you miss your German/Swiss mixes, this is for you.
0,Bought this after it was mentioned in a foodie article and I love it! Sprinkled it on salmon before pan searing, which added a nice color, and the taste was great! Be prepared for a little heat, though.
0,Good deal
0,Thanks for a fresh product. Fast service. Very pleased with the condition of the nuts. Half and wholes. Very nice. Will reorder!!!!
0,Love this tea because it really IS GENTLE. I found I had to double up on it, though. Otherwise, it wouldn't work.		If your system is sensitive, you'll love this.		BOTTOM LINE: Well worth a try.
0,love it.
0,I love the blueberry flavor.  Taste great and easy to throw in your lunch bag.  Took these with me on a 3 week road trip and made having breakfast so easy.  Just add hot water, stir, simmer for 3 minutes and you got a pretty good filling breakfast.  Just add a banana or some other fruit and you have a healthy filling breakfast.
0,It did finally arrive and I forgot about leaving a review.  This quite literally came from Japan.  And here I thought China took forever... Nope!	It's an okay spice.  I don't like the overall flavor on its own but then, I am probably not using it as it is truly intended - what that purpose is, I have no clue. I do mix it in with my rubs that I create and it will balance itself within those flavor profiles nicely.
0,all time favorite
0,I never let myself buy chips because I invariably eat the whole bag in a day or two.  So I don't get chips very often, unless they're in a subscription box like these were.  And perhaps because I don't get chips very often, I always think they're delicious when I do have them.  These were no exception.  I thought they tasted wonderful.  They were crispy and had a definite garlic flavor.  They were a little cracker-like, because they are made with semolina flour and baked.		Nutritionally, they're not as good.  These have no fiber and 250 mg of sodium in a bag (about 10% of the recommended daily amount).  I could taste a lot of salt in them while I was eating them, and that's usually a sign of high sodium levels.		The ingredients are not listed on the product page so here they are:		Durum semolina, olive oil, corn starch, canola oil, seasoning (dehydrated garlic, salt, yeast extract, soybean oil, and less than 2% silicon dioxide added to prevent caking), yeast, sorbitan monostearate, ascorbic acid, salt, parsley flakes, soy lecithin, leavening (calcium acid pyrophosphate, monocalcium phosphate), baking soda		These are vegan and kosher but they contain wheat and soy ingredients.		This is probably not something you should eat every day, but they do taste very good to me and would be all right as a treat in an otherwise healthy diet.
0,nice
0,love this  product which is an ongoing product for my cat ....her coat is admired by everyone who sees her...the shine is remarkable...	this particular brand is super !!  also great quality....wonderful !!
0,I want more vanilla flavored
0,Best grape jelly there is
0,A strong aromatic black tea that will certainly supercharge your morning and get you off to a great start.	Contains enough caffeine to keep you moving all day!
0,Good value
0,Ancient harvest quinoa is much cleaner (no grit) than the rest.
0,VERY SWEAT AND DELICIOUS.
0,This is the firs flavor of Timothy's we tried and now it is the house favorite...a real must for your Keurig
0,I enjoy many brands of roasted seaweed snacks.  I liked the different flavor of this type. I also liked that they ingredients were down to earth.  I would buy this again.
0,I got this & took it to work for the break room.  It's cool because it has a counter display opening on one side & a gravity feed opening at the bottom of the front side.  Which ever works best for you, it's there.  As for the hot chocolate, this is a classic.  I prefer Nestle because it tastes more like the old fashion way my grandma made it when I was a kid.  She used baking cocoa, milk & sugar.  This has that kind of flavor to me.  Some other hot cocoas have less of a chocolate flavor, which is why I like the Nestle when it comes to instant hot chocolate.  No complaints here!
0,If you love cashews you will love these.  so good you can't quit eating them!
0,Fabulous coffee! Supposedly 70% less acid than other coffees but taste still very very good.  I have been buying this coffee at my local health-food store but they keep running out.  I hear Publix carries it but that's a cross town trip for me.  Anyway Amazon has been reliable source lately but they keep it as an add-on.
0,I love this masa.....finely ground, wonderful flavor, makes great tortillas. Store bought corn (even organic corn) tortillas have a terrible smell....home made tortillas with this masa are amazing!
0,My wife usually makes pancakes because I hadn't made them in over 20 years, but with this "just add water" mix, I thought I'd give it a try for my twins the other morning. The results were fantastic. I used a little oil in a non-stick skillet and cooked them just a minute or two on each side and they came out perfectly. The taste was excellent. The ingredients arrived fresh in a resealable pouch. So far I've cooked with chocolate chip, peanut butter, whey protein, and cinnamon, and I love all the flavors. It's really hard to mess these up, even if you haven't made pancakes for a while. These are our go-to breakfasts on weekends. Highly recommended.
0,Miracle Noodles are a miracle!  I've used them in so many different recipes but I just found the different noodle shapes.  This is a great variety pack to see which might work for you.  I've used Laughing Cow cheese with the angel hair noodles for Mac and Cheese, the flat noodles in Soup and Rice...well as rice! It's not the same texture exactly and it doesn't have any flavor so you need to take that into consideration.  It does have a fishy smell when you open it but if you follow the directions (rinse and heat) on the back of each pack, that goes away completely.  I HATE fish and that smell and I don't find a trace of it in anything I've used it in.  The vendor's website has great recipes and you can google for more.
0,A good product for that price.
0,I'm loving these Hemp Hearts! The taste is great, I just eat it by itself. 3tbs every other day.
0,Recently I starting eating low carb which meant creative baking.  Which also meant buy things like Baking Powder.  This is an excellent brand and low the ease of buying on Amazon!
0,These are great there are very few empty shells you get your money's worth. Very tasty
0,Can't believe I'm just leaving a review for this Belgian Pearl Sugar now!		I've been using Lars' sugar ever since I took a trip to Belgium and fell in love with REAL Belgian waffles! I'm a food blogger and often try to recreate recipes I've come across in my travels, but often it's just not the same. HOWEVER, my cousin in Belgium gave me an authentic Belgian recipe (helped translate it for me) and with Lars' Belgian Pearl Sugar, I am elated with the results! JUST LIKE the ones I had in Belgium! (You can see the sugar caramelization in my pics.)		I've turned so many people onto these waffles, it's not funny! :) Happy waffle-making!
0,Great rub, great flavor, best price!  I have used on every type of meat with always good results.  Giving just enough boost of flavor to what ever it is used on.
0,This mix is better than store bought GF bread. My husband prefers it over other brands. I had to buy a stronger mixer than my old one because the batter gets very thick. I would recommend  this product for its flavor. I'm not gluten free but I like the taste of it too.
0,Good quality.
0,My wife's favorite mints. Very good quality and smooth taste.
0,This is great tasting salt. You don't have to use as much salt as regular salt and because it's red it looks nice in a glass salt box, getting the taste benefit and the visual effect.
0,Fabulous popcorn, even though it has a buttery taste but it's not greasy.		However, the best part about this popcorn is the packaging. I know this sounds odd but trust me the popcorn that comes out of this package tastes F R E SH E R. The funny thing is, that besides the info "glutenfree", "nutFree", "nonGMO" this package lists "156 whole wheat", "huge taste" AND  "SNACK RESPONSIBLY" (in capital letters). I saw it as opened the package and actually laughed when I saw it. Finally, a food manufacturer has come up with a new idea....		But, it's true! This popcorn tastes buttery in an almost elegant way; the taste is amazingly addictive.	Thank God I had only one package but I am pretty sure if I would have had a second one, I would have eaten it too, in an irresponsible way!
0,Very good. Have ordered before and will order again.
0,Still me is go product I love it
0,The shape is a bit awkward, and I wish the milk area had slighlty more room (perhaps by making the shape less awkward) but overall, a good product. Makes it easy to bring breakfast to work when I don't have time to eat at home.
0,Clearly the best sugar free pancake syrup we have ever tried. It is thick and rich and has no "sugar free" after taste. 10 stars.
0,Very good quantity, great quality.
0,They love these!
0,After trying lots of different k-cup varieties in the three years or so that I've had a Keurig, I've settled on the Newman's Own Extra Bold for my usual choice.  It's rich and has plenty of flavor, but not too strong and not bitter.  I love this coffee -- great for breakfast and smooth enough for after dinner, too.
0,Great product.
0,They be real GOOOD !
0,What else is to be said?  It is delicious, and the hardest thing is hiding it so the kids can't get it...Good price for 30 candy bars.
0,The real stuff.		The aroma is amazing and the taste very authentic. I used to go to Thai restaurants just for their tea, now I can enjoy it in the privacy of my own home.		Just a word of caution, this is strong stuff, high in caffeine similar to a cup of coffee or two.
0,My favorite Decaf, gets me out of bed most mornings.
0,You will love this flour for all kinds of baking!  It is fresh, and works well for pizza, pastries, pies, as well as breads...
0,Great quick meal.
0,I remember these from childhood, they are delicious and now you can get them without the sugar.
0,Great stuff.  Good source when you aren't near a Latino grocery
0,Excellent coffee....  great in the winter
0,LOVE this stuff.
0,Fresh candy that arrived on time and not melted from the heat. I wasn't a believer of ordering bags of candy online but this showed up and changed my mind. The candy didn't take on the taste of the other candies either.
0,The BEST peppermint tea we've found.
0,I use this in with ground meat for several different dishes. I even add it to soups. I keep this in the pantry at all times.
0,I love the fact that these are so different. You don't see these everyday. I like odd things. They looked awesome when I got them but, I have succeeded in killing them both already :( .... I am so sad about that, because they say anyone can grow these well not me. Anyway they did have some super fast shipping and great care to get plants to me safe. So that was very nice.
0,Always great coffee.
0,Keep it in the kitchen for cooking, adds to my oriental type dishes. Keep it in the bathroom and use as a body lotion for extra dry skin. Keep it in the bedroom for massage and use as a personal lubricant.  Can't go wrong, it is natural.
0,I got this as a sample and thought it was so good so began hunting it down. Amazon offers a pretty fair price so don't hesitate to pick yourself up one or two like I did!
0,i love sour cream and onion pringles. I love that amazon has them even more.
0,Previously ordered these coffee pods. I like the variety of flavors. I did NOT intend to order the decaf. That said, it has been nice to have a hot cup of coffee in evening and not be concerned about caffeine. They will all be used. I will reorder them again.
0,The price is better than that could be found in my local supermarket and the quality of the product us significantly betters than others I have tried.
0,All it takes is the tiniest little sprinkle, but this salt packs a punch! Be careful not to use too much, as it can ruin your popcorn. But if used just right, it can make a whole bowl the best part of your movie.
0,The potatoes are good, but the dice is sooooo small!  It's hard to tell from the photo, but they only measure approximately 1/8" x 1/4" and don't get much bigger when rehydrated.  And there are no directions/suggestions on how best to rehydrate or cook, so I just guessed.
0,Great!
0,My wife is a big fan of super dark chocolate. Frankly I find most of them to be a bit too harsh - I grew up enjoying milk chocolate. That said this brand seems, to my sissy-level taste buds, to be less bitter and to taste better than many of the 70% bars that she buys. Moreover she thinks the same so I would take her opinion over mine on the matter.
0,Good basil! Love it.
0,Gives a great flavor to anything you would like mango in. I use it for several things from lemonade to iced tea to flavoring some shine
0,Delicious! I was surprised at the flavor. I know it's possible that molasses won't always taste exactly the same, but I've had two different batches of this brand and both were good. I hadn't had any molasses in quite some time, but there was always this weird kind of aftertaste I didn't like after taking it straight and this didn't seem to have it.
0,I LOVE TO MAKE A JELLY LIKE DESSERT OR I JUST MIX IT WATER AND DRINK IT--IT IS GOOD FOR ME AND IT TASTE GOOD.
0,Just like advertised and arrived when expected. Nothing extraordinary about this but you get what you expect. I will probably try to find one that reseals next time.
0,Thanks!  Delicious as usual and much more timely than ever!
0,Initially a b'day gift, I've become hooked.
0,This may be the best tasting dried papaya I've ever had.  It's definitely the best unsulfured I've had.  Perhaps some people expected it to taste like fresh papaya, but that's like expecting raisins to taste like fresh grapes.		The only thing I think could use improving in the bag they come in, which could use a zip-lock closure.
0,Taste great will with hot or cold soy milk or regular milk. I also eat it with yogurt. Can't go wrong with this.
0,There  are many other gochujang products available. This one is a good buy for the amount and a decent tasting product. In a perfect world I could get one of their competitors (or theirs) premium products for a better price but I doubt that will ever happen. This is a very good product (not quite great) for a reasonable price.
0,Gum is awesome. When it loses taste, you simply replace it with a new piece. This box allows you to repeat the process multiple times.
0,Great.in.my.drin
0,Yum
0,I should put these on subscription. every time I turn around I am ordering more. Great tasting, long lasting (if your not eating them).
0,Great stuff for dog treats!!!
0,A whole new world of exploring tea---Great!
0,Great taste, and perfect size.  I even bought some for my dad who loves it too.
0,Himalayan Coarse Salt is just the best!
0,I find that I can mix it with at least twice as much fluid as their directions above suggest, unless I want VERY chunky soup. A little bit goes a long way! Just mix 1/4 cup with 3 to 4 cups broth, bouillon, and/or water and you have a great vegetable soup base! Add diced meat if desired, and maybe throw in some noodles or macaroni near the end of simmering and you get a great little pot of soup! I usually simmer for at least half an hour to an hour to really let the flavors blend.
0,ok
0,Delicious and nutritious.  Many recipes that are tasty with chia seeds.
0,Best coffee ever. I'm amazed coffee this good is so affordable.
0,Very easy to work with! I make my own marshmallow fondant, but only needed a little black. First time using this kind and it's amazing! Taste great and easy to work with.
0,Grew up on that stuff, I'm so happy you can buy it now through Amazon/ Euro Food Mart.	Hanuta are small squares of crisp wafers, with chocolate cream and hazelnut pieces in between.	Think hardened Nutella with chunks of hazelnuts in between two tasty, crispy vanilla flavored wafers.	You could put those in the fridge and that makes these even better IMHO.		Buy em!
0,Love this liquid, only a drop or two needed to sweeten your beverage.  Use it in combination with sugar alcohols to tone down the "cooling after taste".  I also like that no compromising sugars have been added, just pure sucralose.
0,I like Spice Lab's Himalayan Salt.  It has a nice taste and I believe it is much healthier for me to use, than the regular white sale I had used for years.
0,Love these Brazil nuts! They are big and fresh and will purchase these again! Great value, too!
0,These were for my husband and he loved them.  He is a "Tabasco" person!
0,TOP,NOTCH
0,My husband's favorite for his morning coffee and throughout the day
0,Great tasting coffee, just wish it were organic too!!  Most decaff coffees are too mild for me - always have to add a heaping scoop for each cup to satisfy my taste buds - I like a more robust flavor.  Don Pablo makes the grade!
0,I have recently begun drinking yerba mate teas.  I was surprised that they really do help me in the mornings without the nervous effects that can come with the caffeine of coffee.  I have always loved chocolate and have been limited because of diabetes so this is a good way for me to sip and enjoy my chocolate.  I have to use this one very sparingly because of its expense but it is a treat for me.  I add a little half-n-half (or fat free half-n-half) and some Stevia and I enjoy every moment of drinking this tea.	This particular blend includes several other spices, I would guess maybe it is chai, and when I open the box I am almost positive that I smell black pepper.  I wish they made this in a loose tea form.  When I am going to have it I do tear open the tea bag and pour the leaves into my steeper to get the full effect.  Don't expect this to taste like chocolate milk, you will be disappointed.  The flavor is unique as is the consistency.  Without the sweetener it's not as flavorful for me.  I have stashed some of this at the top of the cupboard to keep as my comfort drink on a day when I just need an emotional lift.
0,Great value
0,Great EASY cookie recipe!	Ingredients: Rolos, Pretzels, and Walnut or Pecan Halves:	You will need: A Cookie Sheet and Parchment Paper.		Line cookie sheet with parchment paper. Place pretzels in rows, top each with 1 Rolo in center. Place in a preheated 300-325F oven for just about 4 minutes. You want the Rolo to just get soft. Take the pan out and place a walnut or pecan half on top and smush it down a little bit. Allow them to cool down, then put them in the fridge to speed up the process. You want the caramel inside to have time to get chilled. Peel them off the paper and.. VOILA! sweet, gooey, salty caramel crunchy cookies!
0,Great to throw in your pack for a qwick shot protien on the trail.
0,Good price and high quality peppercorns.
0,These are quite tasty but need for fiber to be completely satisfying.
0,I've never been a fan of protein shakes but these are great!  I've tried the cappuccino, chocolate and vanilla flavors.  The cappuccino is my favorite as it masks the protein flavor the best.  I also think it's great to experience the coffee flavor without the caffeine, dairy and added sugar.  The chocolate flavor is nice, tastes like chocolate milk and some of the protein taste is evident but it's still enjoyable.  The vanilla is good as well, it has a vanilla bean flavor to it versus a fake vanilla taste.  These do not keep me full for very long but definitely help to satisfy my sweet tooth and work for me as a snack in between meals.
0,Great for a quick snack.
0,Great honey, healing for my tummy.
0,The best bargain!,
0,great product for meal prepping and keeping a lean protein based diet
0,excellent, this is for my husband, he loves them, these are the very best, and the price beats every store we have seen them in
0,Very pleased with purchase.
0,I don't have any other brand to compare to, but I do like the flavor. I have been using it my teas. Good value for the money.
0,Excellent taste - love em
0,I picked this up on a whim at Costco because they had cases of 24 bottles for $9.97. My normal cola is the Mexican Coca-Cola and this one from Fentimans is quite different. The Fentimans isn't as sweet as the Mexican Coke which gives it a lighter taste which I really enjoyed.		Since I didn't see them on the product page, here are the listed ingredients:		Carbonated Water, Fermented Ginger Root Extract (water, glucose syrup, ginger root, yeast), Sugar, Flavourings, Colour: Caramel (E150d), Phosphoric Acid (E338), Caffeine		You can taste the ginger but it isn't overpowering. My wife, who doesn't like ginger much, really enjoyed this cola.		Overall, if you can get this at the right price I'd say to give it a try. While it won't replace Mexican Coke as my favorite cola it is a worthy adversary and different enough that both can exist side by side in my fridge!
0,I didn't realize how much seasoning came in a 1 lb package.  I have plenty for my own use and shared some with a couple of neighbors as well. It arrived as promised. seemed to be very fresh which made my nose very happy.
0,As expected!
0,the best holiday!!!!
0,A tad salty but a good real turkey concentrate. Easy to use.
0,Like others have already said, this organic raw honey is the best honey you can get-- good for your health in moderation, and tastes really great.
0,I am from Louisiana and am so glad I can get my creole seasoning now without ordering from LA. It is Great. Do not need other seasoning with this and brings home the taste I grew up with.
0,It tastes very good. This is much better than the chocolate and white chocolate that I've had from this company.
0,Love this tea it is refreshing and energizing.  Hard to find in this area sometimes.  Price is more than reasonable.  Great for a snowy day !
0,This is delicious coffee. If the price remains good Ill for sure order again. I like flavored coffee but enjoy switching around. Not sure if its ok to mention the packaging here but I don't like that it was shipped on an envelope. A box would be safer.
0,I love this honey and it's nice to be able to get two smaller jars at a discount rather than have to purchase a larger jar to get it at a discount. Much easier to use and store the smaller jars. I prefer raw honey and have purchased this brand locally, nice to find it here.
0,Ordered for my mother, who loves this tea. In my opinion it's the best tea you'll ever drink.	Since my childhood I've been mixing tea and lemonade for a refreshing drink, this is just	a whole lot easier.
0,The best dressing available. It is perfect if you use Rice vinegar with just enough Balsamic to change the color, and a little extra x-tra Virgin olive oil
0,You want some fat in your diet and do not know how to do so? This coconut oil is good to put in a smoothie especially with bananas and strawberries!
1,Shopping Costco I first discovered Belvita's Cinnamon Brown Sugar biscuits which I loved. For the last month I've ate a package of those for lunch and they held me perfectly until the evening meal. This time Costco was out of the Brown Sugar biscuits but had these Soft Baked Banana bread instead. This flavor is terrible. While soft it's like biting into sand. They have a gritty texture and that horrible fake artificial banana taste. Just say no! I will not be buying these again in the future. Hubby agreed to take the box to work otherwise it would be in the trash can.
1,It says 3 boxes in the description, which is why I'm stuck with tea that costs twice as much as usual.  For Triple Leaf Blood Pressure Tea that is the same price for six boxes, buy here:		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Triple-Leaf-Tea-Tea-Bags-Blood-Pressure-1-06-Ounce-Bags-20-Count-Boxes-Pack-of-6/dp/B000LKW1BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Triple Leaf Tea, Tea Bags, Blood Pressure, 1.06-Ounce Bags, 20-Count Boxes, Pack of 6</a>		As for this item?  It does nothing at all for my blood pressure, and I have been using two bags per day, every day, for several years.  (It alleviates other symptoms which aren't listed on the package.)  After long term regular doses, my blood pressure remains as high as usual.		And today, it's significantly higher.
1,Honest Tea, Half Tea & Lemonade Taste like flavored water.  (1 tea bag and a couple drops of lemon juice with lots of water to make a 12 pack .)	 I will not buy this again. Horrible.	Pure Leaf Iced Tea is so much better!
1,Maltesers are fantastic, but I wouldn't buy any food from Amazon ever again.  I've read too many reviews about stale food, and wow, this was about as stale as they come!  I tried eating them anyway, but after I got them, found them for sale in a store.  Wow!  What a difference!  These were terribly stale from Amazon, and I would be VERY hesitant about buying ANY food from amazon ever again.		UPDATE 2/2013: Since this time I've ordered a few other food products from Amazon and been happy. Maybe a fluke with the ones I got (or the Maltesers in general).  Just had to clarify, since I can't say that all food on Amazon is stale.		UPDATE 7/2013: Have since ordered a LOT more stuff from Amazon, and realized that the seller probably had more to do with the staleness. Bought in Oct 2009 from Nutricity.  I'm not saying they're a bad company, but in 2009 they had some stale product.
1,It is sort of pathetic to think that I have started to resort to K-cups for a hot chocolate fix, but blame my husband. He bought these at the store thinking I'd have a moment of rapture on a subzero morning. He loves our Keurig and those K-cups for tea and coffee.	These are o.k. if you like a watery tasting cup of hot chocolate. Unlike the packets of Swiss Miss that contains what look like dehydrated mini marshmallows and that you can doctor up with chocolate and milk, the K-cups just aren't accomodating in that respect. If you like real hot chocolate this won't make it. It is weak and very chalky tasting. Watery, too. However, since it is made with water what do you expect?	Given the cost and quality and overall nothing flavor, do yourself a favor and pass. Make it from scratch or take a trip to Mickey D's.
1,Tastes like rotting bananas
1,I ordered this product and half the bag was rock hard and the other half were still tough. Really disappointed.
1,Every tea bag I have opened has been torn which leaves me with contents floating around my mug :(
1,This is not what I call 'shredded'.  Imagine the size of small white rice shreds and that is what you will get.  As close to powder as possible.  If you want that then this is great but if you are looking for meatier shreds then buy something else.
1,I don't know if I got a bad box but mine did not resemble the picture & were toasted very dark (burnt in my opinion). I was also looking for something with more flavor. If you're searching for a GF alternative to Win Schuler's bar chips--this isn't it. I wouldn't buy again.
1,I'm pretty sure this was the first 'sugar-free syrup' I've ever bought. So maybe they're all like this...but this stuff has a weird aftertaste. And the overall maple flavor just isn't very strong. I doubt I'll use it again and I think I'll just go back to the full sugar stuff.
1,MSG is the sodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid and a form of glutamate. It is sold as a fine white crystal substance, similar in appearance to salt or sugar. It does not have a distinct flavor of its own, and how it adds flavor to other foods is not fully understood. Many scientists believe that MSG stimulates glutamate receptors in the tongue to augment meat-like flavors. -- FDA
1,What's up Sarah Lee?  Used to love your Pound Cake.  But this was DRY!  Ended up having to throw out, chocolate sauce and whipped cream couldn't even save it!
1,I've never smelled or tasted broccoli this bad before. The broccoli appeared to be good and well within the 'best use by' date but maybe this was just a bad batch? As I was eating these I noticed they smelled rancid, the dip I was using initially masked the smell and the taste but after I stopped using the dip I noticed it was the broccoli. I ended up getting sick and then threw the whole thing out. I won't be buying again.
1,The image is deceiving It looks like it comes in a carton-which we associate with BPA free packaging. It's a sealed plastic bag of coconut milk in a flimsy box.
1,More sugary not as much maple taste
1,A friend gave me one of these to try.  I thought it tasted OK, but after checking the nutritional info and seeing how much sodium it contains - almost 1,000 mg  - would never buy this product.
1,After reading various reviews online left me undecided, I tried a number of different locally available non-dairy creamers, and thought I would post my results here.		I avoided the traditional partially hydrogenated oil type as well as soy-based products. This being said, if you don't mind those consuming those substances, they are both superior options in approximating real dairy products.		I tried the flavor of the products alone, mixed with hot water, and mixed with coffee. To estimate the products ability to lighten a cup of coffee, opacity was estimated in a mixed solution of 30 g of product in 200 g of aqueous solution.		It is noteworthy that dairy cream has about 45 calories per Tbsp, so it is much more caloric than the following substitutes:		TRADER JOES ORIGINAL COCONUT CREAMER. At 9 cents per ounce and 5 cal/Tbsp, this is the least expensive and lowest in calories. Its not particularly thick, but added titanium dioxide gives a pleasant brilliant white color, and helps provide an opacity similar to 1% milk. It is unobtrusive, with a neutral flavor that only minimally suggests coconut mostly on the aftertaste. It mixes well with coffee and provides a subtle milky mouthfeel with mild sweetness. The combination of low cost, low calories, and innocuous flavor make this an attractive product.		SO DELICIOUS COCONUT MILK CREAMER, FRENCH VANILLA. At 10 cents per ounce, its inexpensive, but added sugar yields a whopping 25 cal. Tbsp.  Its reasonably thick and mixes well in coffee with the opacity of nonfat milk. The coconut taste is very pronounced and only intensified by the added vanilla, leading to a super-sweet coconut flavor that will dominate anything you add it to.		SO DELICIOUS BARISTA COCONUT CREAMER. At 10 cents per ounce, its inexpensive. Without added sugar, it registers 10 cal/Tbsp, but this product came clumped in the container, perhaps due to its added pea protein . Even after vigorous shaking, this did not mix well resulting in an opacity of nonfat milk. It had a chalky, gritty mouthfeel with a mildly sweet bland flavor of thickening agents (like cornstarch, etc.) In hot coffee, it intensified bitterness.		CALIFIA ALMOND CREAMER, VANILLA. At 16 cents per ounce, its pricey. With the added sugar, it registers 15 cal/Tbsp. It is extremely thick, with a consistency similar to pancake batter, only with an unappealing ecru color. The thickness makes it challenging to mix, and small particles remained despite vigorous stirring. The opacity was similar to lowfat milk, and it had a bland mouthfeel and an aftertaste of thickening agents. However, the flavor was ultra-sweet to the point of being cloying. Unless you enjoy ultra-sugary dessert drinks, this may simply be too sweet to use.		CALIFIA BETTER HALF UNSWEETENED. At 21 cents an ounce, this is very expensive. Without sugar, it has 7.5 cal/Tbsp. with a off-putting light ecru color and an opacity similar to nonfat milk. The flavor was a blend of mild coconut and almond, similar to a bland cheap ice cream, perhaps due to the thickening agents. On its own, this has a pleasant flavor, but unfortunately when mixed in coffee, the almond seems to intensify the bitterness. The twist cap (designed to break the seal of the Tetra-Pak when opened) was hard to open; I ended up using a set of pliers to open it.		NUTPODS ORIGINAL UNSWEETENED. At 27 cents per ounce, this is prohibitively expensive. Without sugar, it has 10 cal/Tbsp. and has a thickness similar to cream, albeit with a color similar to evaporated milk. It mixes well with some effort, with an opacity similar to regular milk. Alone, it has a flavor similar to a protein drink, but when mixed with coffee, it leads to a mild increase in bitterness. Nevertheless, save for the usurious price, this product comes close to rivaling soy milk products.
1,This is garlic powder...dust really and very difficult to use even if you use a fine shaker.
1,not for me to sweet
1,Disappointed.  Expected the flavor to be much stronger.
1,The candies themselves are the warheads you know and love, but these bulk packs seem to always arrive melted. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but seeing as the wrappers are made of a plastic foil, the melted candies end up with a large layer of plastic melted onto them. So far I've had to throw out close to half of the candies.		Do yourself a favor and buy the boxed version. It'll cost more, but you'll end up with more candy in your mouth and none in the garbage.
1,Not a fan of this flavor. I guess it's my own fault, I expected it to taste like mint hot chocolate, but it's tea so it's water flavored like mint chocolate, which I found not tasty.  Had a couple people try it as well and no one really liked it.
1,There just ok. Artificial colors and flavors. It's just more generic junk. Honees are far better. I think all the 5 star reviews are from the sellers of this candy
1,Overpriced, not particularly appetizing.
1,thought it was a good idea. it should be packaged in a more sturdy container, think hard cardboard so you don't end up with a lot of crumbly pieces. won't buy again.
1,Another reviewer is right, the coffee is bitter. No amount of sugar can fix that. Going back to my tried and true for over a year now...Italian Lavaz**
1,These cookies are hard & somewhat	lacking in taste. We threw out half the bag.	Mostly because my children did not like	ginger snaps & my husband and I did not care for these.
1,I couldn't be bothered returning this- but I ordered this and the package came of regular coffee I felt confused because I knew I'd ordered the hazlenut. It was a gift for a friend who just got a new keurig. Since she didn't know what had been ordered and I couldn't be botheres I kept it. Still highly annoying.
1,Awfully strong, and sweet. Avery warm mint, almost hot. Creme De Mint much nicer.
1,I started getting a few MRE before I invested in cases of it in the event of an emergency. I'm a mom and my child is everything to me. So I want to be prepared. We tried these MRE together to see how we would like it if we had to. Thankfully I made the right choice at trying them out.		Ratatolli was my pick because I normally love it.		Ratatolli 1/5 really gross	Crackers and PB 5/5	Strawberry banana shake 3/5	Nuts and dried fruit NA allergy		Overall it was basically uneatable except for the crackers and the shake.		Will find other options for emergency food supply.
1,absolute trash. went right into the garbage. was not shipped in a food grade mailer. grey and sad. no fragrance
1,Very disappointed. I love their teas & was so surprised it had very little flavor.
1,a waste
1,This stuff I expected to be like Twizzlers.  It was more like plastic.  Inedible.  A huge waste of money.
1,Old and moldy. No thanks.
1,It was just barely okay.  I had high expectations as I like their vanilla syrup.  This one smelled so strong that I mixed a little vanilla in.  It still had a medicinal kind of taste.  I want to try the pumpkin flavor but Amazon doesn't have it.  I will use this bottle up but will not buy this flavor again.
1,This is th worst kernel I've used.  There are a ton of kernels left over and they are quite underpopped.  Orville is much better.
1,Broken and thrown In the garbage
1,I love this brand of freeze dried fruit but found the mango variety to lack flavor...unlike mango juice itself.  Maybe when you take the "juice" out of this fruit it's just dried fiber. Not satisfying.
1,And no, that's not a good thing.		It's all about hype, marketing, packaging, and hugely inflated prices on mediocre product.
1,Can't believe I fell for the reviews from people that were given this coffee as a promo. I was so excited to try this. Honestly, I screamed when it came in. I waited all day for it and it showed up at 7 pm. Heck I really wanted to try this so much...that I made myself a cup in the evening because I couldn't wait till the morning. I usually don't drink coffee at night.		I even went out and bought my usual  creamer to give it a fair comparison. It tastes like a decaf. It is bland.  It is not bitter though. Wish I could return.
1,Not hate but disappointed. I'm a bit of a connoisseur of licorice and this tasted like the smell of burning, rubber tires. And, yep, smelled those.
1,I would have returned this, but was told I could not. I thought everything was returnable. This did not taste much like any good chocolate to me. It was not fresh and chewy; it tasted old and it was not very chewy at all. I like the all natural ingredients idea, but this one needs a lot of improvement. I had to throw it away; I just could not eat it. Tried it once when I opened it, then waited a few days to see if it tasted any better to me. It did not. Very disappointing and a waste of my money. I realize Amazon can't re-sell food that has been opened, but an exchange for something else in the same price range seems reasonable to me. Otherwise, I am not going to feel open to trying new products; if they are no good, we're just stuck for the amount we paid for them. Maybe Amazon should re-think that policy...
1,But ut had a strange flavor.  ALmost like plastic.  I am going to stick to Teavana.  This was expensive and ended up being a waste of money.
1,This product claims it is "Simply Salted", though a read of ingredients I soon discover it has soybean oil.
1,These almonds were stale. The nuts were chewy and not crunchy at all as in the description.
1,has a bit of a chemical taste to it.  wouldn't purchase again.  The French Vanilla is more subtle...
1,I read some of the reviews about bad, toxic smells. I thought it may be just a matter of taste per individual. I tried to be open minded and order some to try and decided for myself. But, I have to agree it is a very unpleasant odor. This is unlike any other star anise I have had in the past. I was really surprised by the powerful chemical smell. I use star anise in tea, so I decided to make some tea. It had a very astringent and tannin quality to it. The taste wasn't as strong as the smell, but I did not enjoy it. I would not buy again. perhaps it is the variety of anise used or the was it was processed.
1,I bought a case of these to make some desserts.  I had no idea I would get so many in each 7 oz. package, or that they would be so big, or that they would be so crunchy.  Taste is fine.  Just know that if you're making a dessert and you expect the ladyfingers to suck up the sauce or sherry or liqueur, buy more sauce/sherry/liqueur than you planned!
1,If your neck is short you can't get the support you need because if you pump it up to full capacity the top roll covers our mouth!
1,These were absolutely terrible.  Both pkgs. were dried out and one pkg was open and retaped.  I will never buy from this buyer again.  What a waste of money.
1,There is allot of Buzz words used in this lower grade Jarrow coconut oil.	All coconut oil is organic, as the coconut trees are Not sprayed. But being expeller pressed, and using Dried Copra coconuts is	Not the fresh coconut I would use for cooking or eating..	A good food grade coconut , is Not refined, and put through that high higher temperature, than cold press, and is not	Your higher quality coconut oil. Most of this type comes to the Usa.	Although there is other companies that make a higher grade of refined water steamed coconut oils if you do not want the coconut taste.	Virgin coconut oil is from a fresh right off the tree coconut, and Extra virgin is another Buzz word.	Extra virgin ,cold pressed is a word for a good grade olive oil, but cold pressed is for a healther coconut oil.	There is not any taste to this. This says it does not utilize solvents, but does Not say its steamed or water washed! So how is this expeller pressed, Refined?		I only give this grade to my two big dogs, and a little dog. This is still good for my dogs coat, and helps if they have skin allergies.		The only coconut oil I use to cook with, eat etc  Comes from the meat of matured coconuts (not picked too early, not laid out to dry-copra).	But  is virgin cold-pressed, and is Unrefined. This Jarrow is none of those to my disappointment.		I also notice Jarrow coconut oil for one tablespoon is 130 calories, and the coconut oil I use is 120 calories for one tablespoon!	Jarrow sat. fat 13g, mine is 12 g, ,but the good fat Monounsaturated 0.5g, and mine is 1g. Which is higher (much better).	A good coconut oil does Not come in a plastic Bpa jar. Coconut oil should come in a Glass jar, and store in a cool dry place.	You do not need to keep a good coconut oil in the frig. Jarrow says after opening, store in Frig!	I personally did not lke the non-taste of this, or the color.	If you are looking for Non-taste coconut oils, there are better ones then this one I believe. (I have bought the non-taste ones before)
1,I love the Dunkin Donuts pumpkin coffee and pumpkin spice latte, so I asked for pumpkin syrup for Christmas and received this as a gift.  I was incredibly excited, until I tasted my coffee.  At first, I thought my milk had gone bad, because the coffee just tasted unpleasant and odd.  I tossed the coffee and poured a new cup, adding milk from a different container, and was met by the same putrid taste.		To me, the syrup tastes like rotten squash/pumpkin.  I didn't taste much (or any) spice, though that may have been the overpowering smell of something spoiled.  I tried several proportions of coffee:milk:syrup and could not come up with anything palatable.		I strongly suggest you do not purchase this product, unless I got a terrible batch (in which case, Torani needs to tweak their quality control process!).
1,First I would like to say that my tongue has been exposed to the finest chili chocolate in the USA made in the state of Oregon so I may be biased. I hoped that this bar would be similar since the other is not as accessible. I do not taste the chili in this bar.  Total waste of you are looking for a chili-chocolate experience. Nothing wrong with the chocolate as a stand alone.
1,stale and broken
1,to me, it was a horrible experience! First of all, I ordered LIGHT coconut milk by a mistake. I never trust products with reduced fat. When it arrived and I read the list of ingredients, I got upset, as I read gum was added to the milk. Then I realized it was light milk. anyway, I tried it... and I did not like it at all. It leaves some funny feelings in my throat... it makes me wanna cough or something... very unpleasant... I tried cooking with it. Well, the same thing. Diluting it with water helped a bit, however. I made hot chocolate, and had to dump it, as this milk made it taste terrible!! and it was impossible to drink. Only baking was a way for me to utilize this product. At first, I thought it was me who is not used to this kind of milk. However, recently I ordered full fat coconut milk. Oh my!!!! what a deliciousness!!!! no funny feelings in my throat!!! Tastes SO good! And hot chocolate turned out just perfect!	This is the reason why I decided to review this product.	Conclusion. I will NEVER buy it again, and I would not recommend it to other people, regardless of all good reviews.
1,If it was taste alone, it would be 4 stars - for those who want a sweet peanut butter.		However, there are several things that keep this at 2.5 stars:		My first complain is the ingredients:	1. Barely any honey. (it is the last ingredient on the long list of ingredients)	2. Sweetened with sugar (as opposed to honey)	3. Filled with hydrogenated oils (rapeseed, cottonseed)	4. In addition to partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil again (why the need for a fully hydrogenated one, and a partial one is bizarre)	5. Then more sugar at the end.		The amounts of unnecessary sugar and modified oils, makes it ironic given their statement: "Wholesome products for wholesome kids". Sounds like a joke to me. At least it uses sugar as opposed to high fructose corn syrup, I kept it at 2 stars.		Here are the other factors:	1. Taste (not very peanut buttery) since it is a lot of oils and sugar, you don't really taste the peanut butter and peanut oil which is removed from this product in lieu of the hydrogenated ones. Some people who like sugary peanut butter (like generic Skippy) will be fine with this. But if you typically eat Adams, or other more nautral peanut butter (whose only ingredient on the list is peanuts) this will be lacking.	2. Doesn't taste like honey. Not surpising given their ingredient list.		Pros:	- The taste is fine, in general, and I did eat this despite my reservations.		I am always confused why it's so hard to keep the product simple and natural.	The only 2 ingredients I would expect in the package are honey and peanuts. I guess if the package said: "Sugary and hydrogenated oily Peanut butter" it wouldn't sell as much as honey roasted creamy. But the former is a more accurate representation of what this is.
1,yes the Philippine mangoes are the best but I am looking for just organic dried mangoes with no sugar or other ingredients  in it.
1,Sorry I ordered these altho I guess I should have expected the soft baked texture. When you add the taste they are just a bit too unnatural kinda chemical for me. I should have stuck with regular bake.
1,not as shown.  its thick and whiter in color.  the kind of honey I don't like.  almost no taste.  weird stuff.
1,Not great
1,Didn't really like the taste. Packages messy to get open and put in a water bottle.
1,not as spicy as advertised.  more pepper required.
1,Arrived stale, made even worse by trying to make health rice puff treats. Expensive too. A disaster all around.
1,in this day and age you'd think they could make a bag that doesn't fall apart after you open it.	Planned obsolescence I believe it's called. Last Snyders Of Hanover I'll ever buy.
1,I was so happy to see this item on the website. But when I finally received the bag, I was disappointed!	The Sichuan Peppercorns are old and no flavor at all!	Will NOT recommend to anyone who is really looking for the real taste!!!
1,Kale may very well be the liver of the vegetable world: It is very nutritious, but very few people care for the taste.  That's why I have recently come upon this rough, but highly valuable green.  I looked for online recipes, and the easy one where you put extra virgin olive oil and sea salt on it, put it in the oven, and let it bake.  Supposedly, the end result would be the stellar kale tasting something akin to potato chips.  While I don't feel like it worked that well, it certainly was at least palatable to keep my interest. My second encounter with kale came during a visit to a coffee cafe where they served a seasonal salad (spring and summer may not be right for some to eat autumn salad, but, hey it worked for me, so why quibble?) with only kale as greens, a raspberry vinaigrette dressing, dried cranberries and blueberries.  I enjoyed it, but I could tell the fixin's were the salad's secular salvation.		The best things I can say for Rhythm Superfoods Kale Chips are they are convenient, healthy, and gluten-free and dairy-free. (Yes, despite the "Kool Ranch" flavor, they are dairy-free.)  Otherwise, I find this snack to be too salty and dry. Convenience really gives this product an edge that some will insist on buying or re-buying, but for me, I'd rather stick to the simple Kale Chips you can make in your oven.  You have to give Rhythm Superfoods credit for trying, though.
1,Not only does it tastes like there is no sweetener, it has a horrible chemical aftertaste to it.  I would rather just have an unsweetened chocolate - then I could add my own sweetener to make it right.		It is so strange that the sugar free is so awful.  The hershey's 50% reduced sugar tastes almost like regular.
1,I miss Sabra hummus. The only reason I wanted to try this was because of the academic that was going around about Sabra hummus. I've heard of wild garden products before and thought I'd give it a try. The hummus tastes so bad. It tastes sour. I feel bad for wasting $20+ on this item. Wish I could give it back. If you are used to a certain high quality hummus do not buy this hummus. It'll apoil the taste of your food and leave a horrible after taste that lingers.
1,Sorry I couldn't eat them, they were partially covered with a chemical substance.  No refund.
1,Not worth the money
1,Expensive but nothing special.  Haven't noticed any toffee or caramel flavor.
1,First and foremost, my 2 younger children and myself cannot have gluten. We cannot have things that have been cross contaminated with gluten. Celiac sucks, but it is something my 2 littlest and myself have to live with every single day. I know it says on the box that this bisquick is made in a gluten free facility, but it made my kids break out in their rashes they get when gluten is ingested, as well as their typical digestive upset. I won't get into my symptoms with it.	This was the only new thing I introduced, as we have learned that with new, untrusted products, we have to try one at a time, with several days in between just to be sure there is no reaction. I don't know if there was a way for any of the ingredients to become contaminated as I do not know their processing procedures, but I just want to caution anyone that MUST live gluten free due to allergies to tread carefully with this gluten free bisquick.		I received this as a gift because I have been trying to make gluten free biscuits that are fluffy and not crumbly.	Well, not only are the biscuits crumbly, they are also sort of rubbery, as the recipe to make biscuits requires eggs! All the years I have made biscuits, I have never had a recipe that required eggs.	I didn't care for the flavor either, and they didn't rise at all.		Also made pancakes with them. They were ok, but I prefer the coconut flour pancakes I usually make as far as flavor.		Back to the drawing board for me on my quest for some awesome, fluffy, gluten free biscuits that don't have weird ingredients, or a million ingredients.		With the allergy issues we had (I call it allergy because anyone not living with Celiac will better understand it that way) I cannot recommend this to anyone who has celiac or non celiac gluten sensitivity.
1,I dislike that I did not receive what I ordered. Only received one kind. Ordered the variety pack.
1,I would think that a company aware of food allergies would make sure to list their ingredients for customers of their products, and my REPEATED requests to AMZ to compel vendors to do so are dismissed and ignored.  So much for sensitivity.  Can anyone please list the ingredients for these?  Then those of us with multiple food allergies and hoping to be able to purchase these will know if they are safe for us.  Thank you.
1,I have been a fan of Milo forever and love both types of Milo - the crunchy and the powdery. This review is specifically with respect to the item that I received. I got three tins (as advertised) but all of them expire in less than 8 weeks. I don't drink Milo that often and the ones I bought six months ago from a far-away asian store expire in July 2016. And to top it all, Amazon says I can't return them.
1,I would not recommend this!	Better off with REAL BUTTER!
1,I gave 1 star extra for the flavor however the ingredients are just horrible. If you're looking for a xylitol mint look elsewhere. They add xylitol to it, it does not mean it's a xylitol mint. The ingredients to these mints are absolutely bad for your teeth and health.
1,Wow - I had 3 and my stomach went into knots and continued to some explosive situations. Not pretty, not comfortable. I had to toss them out.
1,Weird after taste, does not taste like chocolate.  Remember those old diabetic chocolate candies from the 70's?  This tastes a lot like that.  I threw it away.  Yuck
1,items quality is great. shipping tooo slow.
1,These do not taste like honey roasted peanuts.  Taste like dry roasted peanuts.
1,Poorly conceived product.  So glad I tested it before gifting to my army sons.  The shapes are not well-formed and the little soldiers are floppy like rag dolls---more insulting than imulating.  Also, the amount of dye needed to achieve the dark green is barely tolerable.  It turns your younger and poop green. Not exactly a treat.  I really love the Albanese gummy bears which I have purchased repeatedly so I was super shocked to see such an inferior product.
1,I did not like the flavor and won't purchase again.
1,My fellow food dorks should be ashamed to boost this crap.
1,This has no fruit flavor; it tastes like spongy flour.
1,I was excited to try this considering it is a healthier alternative to most sugary drinks out there. Unfortunately they all have a heavy artificial sweetener taste to them. The cherry is the only one I can tolerate. I'll gladly take the extra calories and sugar content in Izze and The Switch sparkling juices.
1,While the almond milk itself is delicious, the pour spout not only doesn't work (and rips off every single time you try and open it) but then the nasty glue continues to stay in the pour spout and mixes with your organic milk, changing what you though was healthy organic milk into some kind of synthetic, polymer processed nasty substance.		Pacific needs to get a handle on this packaging and we won't order from them again (we bought a box) until this is fixed
1,I was disappointed with this.  It does not really ever dissolve.  It tastes ok.
1,Let me start by saying that I've had native tea from over 19 different countries, and in literally thousands and thousands of variations.  As far as inexpensive and easily accessible tea goes, TAZO is usually at least a 3 star for me.  When I saw they were offering vanilla and caramel (2 of my all-time flavors) combined in their best selling Chai tea, I thought, what could go wrong?  Unfortunately, everything went wrong.  The aroma is just odd, and the flavor is not the slightest bit pleasant.  When I looked at the ingredients closer, I figured out the problem.  There is ginger, black licorice, and cloves mixed with CARAMEL!  It truly is a horrific combo that should be avoided at all cost.  Worst tea I've ever tasted, from a 25 year tea-drinker (15 year tea enthusiast).  Save your money and go by the Earl Gkrey Supreme or the Vanilla Comoro flavors from Harney & Sons.
1,I used to drink red bull all the time until I found out that it was not good for me. I switched over to healthier alternatives, which taste great, and it's great for me! Do yourself and your body a favor, take a look at these products [...]
1,Very disappointing in several ways. They are tough, and are not 'cored' which makes them tougher to chew, and just plain boring. Won't buy these again.
1,I hate to be THAT person, but these are gross. Buffalo wings are one of my most favorite foods ever but these do not taste like buffalo wings. They taste really sour, then really spicy and hot, and WAY WAY WAY too salty, and I love my salt! I can't pick up a good flavor with these. I'm really sad because they sounded amazing. I recommend the "Everything" Pretzel Crisps.
1,Rice noodles have OODLES of flavor and a wonderful aroma of rice, when cooked (steamed).  This one has, absolutely, NO flavor at all.  The texture is good but it is TASTELESS & BLAND at its best.  Indian grocery stores carry better rice noodles (Although they are as thin as spaghetti) that soak in boiled water for 10 minutes or less.  Or you can make FRESH ones if you have rice grains or rice flour.
1,THE FLAVOR IS ABSOULOUTY DISGUSTING	TRIED IT AND ALMOST THREW UP THE OF	ORDER WENT IN GARBAGE BECAUSE THE	RETURN WINDOW WAS LONG PAST. WOULD	NEVER RECOMEND YOUR PRODUCT !!!!
1,Really strong, high acid coffee that tastes bitter. I won't buy again.
1,This product has an extreamly strong stinky odor that will engulf whatever room you leave the empty cans in. The flavor is good, but has a bad pear after taste that takes a few sips to get used to. The strong stentch of this product makes it not worth it to me.
1,If you like eating something that eats like rubber this is for you. The fettuccine was like overcooked calamari. Same with the noodles. The rice package was almost empty and consisted of part rice, part string like stuff. The spaghetti at least was sort of edible if you let the sauce soak in, but it too was rubbery. I threw away the lasagna & the couscous. So disappointed. There used to be a product called newdles on Amazon but it's no longer available. Too bad. Newdles was a pretty good product.
1,I saw these at a local health food shop and decided to give it a try since I wanted a dairy free chocolate bar.  You certainly get the dark chocolate - very strong and bitter. I knew coconut was in there from the label, and from the shreds of it I could see in the bar but I really did not taste any coconut - the chocolate flavor overpowered it completely.  The label says it contains almonds, but you don't taste that either.  I was hoping for more of a harmonious blend of both chocolate and coconut.  It certainly isn't sweet either.
1,Lemon?  Nope.  Not even a slight lemony taste. Otherwise it's nice tea, but definitely not lemon flavored.
1,I am a huge fan of lentils.  Great that they are organic (only way).  However, they did not taste delicious.  Downer.  Thanks for reading!
1,Almond butter is just way too expensive for regular use.  It tastes ok compared to peanut butter, or any other nut butter.  One thing I dislike (besides price) is it is much runnier then PB, without the nice smooth texture (I'm comparing to real PB not the overprocessed stuff).  So my suggestion is those wanting the health benefits of almonds ought to opt for eating almonds in nut form rather than butter form as you'll save a ton of money.
1,DO NOT LIKE_ Too much lime
1,UPDATE....with star reduction...while these cookies do taste great, all orders have arrived with cookies broken or crushed. I am cancelling future subscribe and save orders due this problem		A tasty cookie that is also healthy.  I like it because it tastes less "sweet" than most cookies.  Great with coffee or tea.
1,wish I had not bought this I do not like it.
1,I didn't like the flavor that much. The normal ones are much better (almond, peanut, Crispy, Pretzel)
1,People are still buying this because of its former reputation as a low-carb pasta.  It's time for those people to wake up.  It doesn't work the way that was claimed. Look up "Dreamfields lawsuit". There was a lawsuit settled in 2014.  Customers led by the claims on packages with "glycemic index" and/or "digestible carbs" got a little money.  Note the wording on the packages now.		Maybe, as the manufacturer claimed, the pasta is made in some patentable "matrix" - true or not, many tests were showing that this product hits your body the same way regular pasta does.		I cooked with this stuff for years.  Thousands, if not millions of us are really disappointed because we wanted this stuff to be our answer to enjoying pasta without spiking our blood sugar.  Too bad. Time to shift to soy noodles, Ciao Carb, Nutriwell or edamame "pasta" or shirataki or konjac noodles.  If you are diabetic, you understand the need to make changes, and this is a big and worthwhile one to free yourself from a habit happily developed, and now sadly discarded.
1,If you like proper English tea this is not for you. I use three of these to get close to an English brew.  Waste of money and now I have six boxes minus 12 teabags from one box.  Buy. PG tips, Typhoo teabags or Yorkshire .  I've warned you!
1,Tasted like it had gone bad
1,I ordered this tea after hearing about it on a podcast.  It was supposed to really mellow you out, like a shot.  Boy was that wrong.		Fiest off, this tea was aweful.  Tastes like dirt with a touch of cinnamon.  Not kidding!  I followed the directions and honestly I can't say it was calming at all.  And within 45 mins I had more heartburn than I've had in over a year!  Had to get out of bed to take a Tums.		I'm returning this overrated product immediately.
1,My mom got a bunch of different flavored Campbell's chunky soups, my favorite being the chicken with dumplings but I decided to try out the baked potato with steak and cheese to switch it up a bit. The picture and description seemed appetizing. I was very wrong. As soon as I pulled it out of the microwave it smelled of puke! It even had the look and texture of it.. I took two bites and I couldn't do it. I can't imagine anyone actually being able to eat the entire can without thinking it was just regurgitated from someone's stomach. Worst soup I ever had! Such a disappointment...
1,This coffee is superb -- but it is available everywhere for 8.99 for the 12 pack. Even at the priciest grocers we have here.
1,i just don't like the taste of this hodgson mill mexican style jalapeno cornbread mix.it's just kind of bland to the taste.
1,It comes in a plastic bag. THE PICTURE IS A LIE! The cumin is OK, but you need to find a bottle or canister to store it in. What a ripoff! So now I have to find something to store it in? Well, thanks, AMAZON.
1,fu yuck terrible fudge.
1,Don't like the taste. prefer the original all bran instead.
1,spend a lot of time picking out stale ones (about 5-10% nuts were not edible: flat, moldy or filthy looking)
1,I agree with the last reviewer, the ingredients list on amazon should be more clear. I thought this was a vegetarian soup when I ordered it,  now after receiving the package I am disappointed to discover that "powdered bonito" is powdered fish. It clearly states that Bonito is fish on the package, but on amazon it doesn't specify this.  So this purchase ended up being nothing more than 10 bucks down the drain for me.		(I have a shellfish allergy that developed a few years ago. I have had to be very careful about all seafood as I have had reactions to some fish paste and soups made with fish sauce at restaurants. Fish & shellfish are not the same as far as allergies, so I do not know why this sometimes happens. It could have been cross-contamination or maybe I am allergic to certain fish as well....In any case, I make it a point to avoid things like "powdered fish" in my food.)
1,As far as organic popcorn this is not the best I have found.  Trader joes has a superior organic product.
1,these are not good tasting. i prefer most almonds, but would not buy these again. Almost a nasty taste.
1,Too sweet!!!
1,I love honey, in general, and this stuff is 10 times better than any other honey I've tried.  So for taste, it easily gets 5 stars. However, I am rating it only 1 star because it has a negative effect on me that I never would have thought; it gives me headaches. I tried it three different times to see if this honey was indeed the culprit and concluded, sadly, it was.  Subsequently, I read up on it and found that many people have allergic reactions to "raw" honey, even when they do not have any reactions to pasteurized honey (which I do not).  Many of the reactions noted were the same as one might get with typical allergies or hay fever such as, sneezing, runny nose, congestion, watery eyes, etc. Headaches were also noted. It has to do with the pollen in it, which I don't know why, but I hadn't even considered. Apparently, a benefit of consuming it, as I understand it, is that consuming small amounts of bee pollen, can actually build up a person's defense against pollen allergies (much the same way as getting a flu shot can protect you from getting the flu).		This honey may not cause any problems for many, but I wanted to share this experience, as I think allergic reactions are a very important consideration that should be factored in prior to purchase (and some may not think of it, as I didn't). I did read that many people "power through" tolerable or minor symptoms (that "may" eventually subside) to enjoy the possible health benefits associated with consuming bee pollen and/or raw honey. I considered doing that, but I am more inclined to think that pain, discomfort, and/or other negative effects (with the exception of sore muscles from a good workout), are pretty good indications/signs/signals our body is giving us to let us know it doesn't like something  we are doing to it...I'm very compelled to listen.:)
1,can't open paper sticks to candy !!!
1,There is an odd almost perfume type of taste to this ginger.  Everything else about it is fine (slice size, packaging, etc).  I will continue ordering my favorite Australian ginger in the future.
1,I was looking for something that actually resembled the mayo taste and what I got was mayo that tasted like almonds.	I tried it in chicken salad and as a sandwich spread and either way, it was not very appetizing.
1,Shrink-flation!  Provide less product for the same price.  You are no longer getting 12 packages with 18 pieces.  You are getting 12 packages with 14 pieces.  That about a 30% price increase.  This isn't a better product.  It is less product for more.
1,Like other reviewers have complained, the candy in the box I received was stale and hard. Ordered it as a Christmas present and the recipient finally mentioned how dried out and hard the candy was and that they also threw it out after sampling a few pieces from different rolls of candy and finding it all the same.
1,This has been my favorite brand of peppermint since I was a child.  My grandmother always had King Leo soft peppermint sticks or balls for herself and the children.  These are now made in Mexico.  The pieces are of irregular shape with pale, irregular stripes.  There is more sweet taste than peppermint taste.  Very disappointed.
1,States "no trace of dairy" but my body reacted after eating a handful of these pretzels. Flavor is good, but this product is dangerous to any who are extremely sensitive to cross-contamination (mine is due to ongoing chemotherapy). I contacted the manufacturing company and got this reply:		"Thank you for your recent email regarding the ou dairy symbol on our packaging.		Even though the ingredients in the product you have may not list any dairy ingredients, the product could have been manufactured on a piece of equipment that also produces products with dairy in them. We do share equipment but take stringent measures to clean all equipment between product changes and trust that this information is helpful to you.		Thank you for your interest in Snyders-Lance, Inc."
1,Don't be fooled by the packaging labeling this product as "pad thai"... this is nothing resembling pad thai. The sauce is an awful rendition of some generic Asian flavoring (think a sickly sweet-sour sauce). Nothing close to tasting like pad thai at all, and whatever it does taste like, it tastes horrible. Although the best by expiration date is several months in the future, the peanut topping was rancid. Even for the non-pickiest of eaters, this is quite unpalatable. Would recommend you absolutely avoid this product.
1,Has very artificial taste and leaves a bitter taste will not purchase again
1,I buy these a few times a year. This last bag sucked (no pun intended) almost every pkg in the bag every gobstopper was discolored. I've seen 1 or 2 in a large bag from time to time like this, but to have 4 out of 5 pieces like this. They taste odd, and leave a bad after taste. I got this last bag from Kimlee and shipped by amazon.
1,Item: Broccoli Cheese Soup	Brand: Campbell's	Purchase: Win-Co	Price: $1.25 in store	Number Purchased: 4		Review		I was so up set by this product. I love Broccoli Cheddar soup, I eat it all the time. I usually get it pre-made at stores or delis. I thought that having it so cheap to make at home would be great. I followed the instructions for stove top and it turned out horrible. The soup was like thick nasty nice, it has a level of grease, and it tasted foul. I couldn't stand it. I attempted it a second time and it was the same thing. It was such a waste of money. I couldn't make it, I wasted the 3rd can trying to bake cheesy chicken with it like in the Campbell's cook book and that was a bust.		I donated the last to the food bank, and I feel bad about it because it was the bad and some poor family is going to get it. (And I usually donated to the food bank each month simply to help people).		Never again, never ever again. Don't waste you time, pick a pre-made frozen brand.
1,i stocked up on this and purchased more than I needed when I bought last year. Just went to open the last bag and saw two dead moth bugs inside. The bag is still sealed as it was when delivered. The expire date is april 2017. I am very disappointed. I would have planned differently if the expiration date didn't mean anything.
1,ONLY HALF OF THE CORN POPPED it was tough and we did not like Would not recommend. Expensive and not worth the price. Requested a refund but this seller did not come through with the refund.
1,Not a favorite for me
1,I pretty much have put Kraft on my do-not-buy list for some time now.  But once in a while I get a hankering for this stuffing, especially if I use chicken  stock for the liquid and add the big-three mirepoix and some chopped apples and minced garlic.		On the other hand, I've quit buying anything that has high-fructose corn syrup.  Had I read the label here on the website, I might have looked elsewhere.  I didn't, and now I had to pay for it the hard way. To add insult to injury, the boxes I ordered on 02/02/2018 say that this product has some GE in it.  ("PARTIALLY PRODUCED WITH GENETIC ENGINEERING")  The shots of the side panels here on the product page are contrived in such a way that you will not see this on the product's pics.  You have to buy the product to read this disclosure.		Happy dining.  ;-)		Speaking of looking elsewhere., I found a product here on Amazon that I should have found the first time:	https://smile.amazon.com/Aleias-Gluten-Free-Foods-Stuffing/dp/B01COSNJYO/ref=sr_1_10_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1517985368&sr=8-10&keywords=Stuffing+Mix&refinements=p_n_is_pantry%3A8417613011#customerReviews
1,Not the Blue Mountain Coffee I experienced in Jamaica
1,Sorry 2 stars, it tastes like the box to me. I'm kind of sorry I subscribe to it, because the one that you want is called Yogi Organic Oreen Tea. Get that one here. Yogi is superbo and wonderfully fragrant for American pallets.
1,Buy these from your local Girl Scout ONLY!  They freeze well so buy a lot and keep them rather than paying some scammer for something old.  Help the Girl Scouts - buy a LOT from THEM!
1,Taste funny.  Not as expected, especially after thoroughly enjoyed YumEarth's candy drops and pops.
1,This tea is weak and did not taste like I expected it to. It basically came out of my machine looking like warm water. I would not drink it myself or serve it to anyone.
1,Cake looked bad, cut poorly, and tasted terrible; at least it was expensive.  If they know u will only ever buy one cake from them they have to get the money up front.  If u must give a gift to someone u dislike, then this is the cake.
1,Does not work in Keurig 2.0 Machines, and not specifically a Keurig pod	Even though the title of this product is: Grove Square Chai Latte, 48-count Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, no where on the box does it say or show the word Keurig. The box does not claim to work in any Keurig machine - Buyer Beware
1,My grocery store just started carrying this brand of tea, although more expensive.  I was going to order through S&S the chocolate mint but wasn't ready to commit to 100 bags of tea I had never tried.  I picked up a box at the store and both my husband and I tried it.  We both thought it was very weak, even after steeping for 5 minutes.  You could faintly taste a little peppermint and chocolate but it was practically non-existent to us.  Bigelow tea has a much fuller flavor in their herb teas that we enjoy.  I think we will stick with that.
1,Worst truffle oil I have ever bought.  It's pretty much olive oil with a little and I mean VERY little truffle flavor and scent.  I wouldn't suggest purchasing this one guys.  Try a different one or try a local olive oil/vinegar store near you.
1,cant find ant meat
1,This tomato juice with clam juice makes this a very tasty drink. Some of my discovery, not contained in the Amazon listing worth considering are; high in salt,(23 grams per 5 ounces), made from concentrate, (not pure ingredients) and priced at about twice the price at its availability at local retail markets Therefore for me, the next purchase of this product for me, will not be via Amazon, but through local retail for a sizable savings
1,not another date sweetened "health" bar.the flavors sound so good but they all taste like DATES. horribly sweet.how about some other natural sweetener-or am I the only one complaining?
1,I ordered these to give out for Easter and almost every single egg is broken! So much for looking nice. I would appreciate a refund.
1,Bought this at the grocery store.  What a disappointment!  This is supposed to be infused with hibiscus, orange peel, rose hips, and PASSION FRUIT flavors.  That's why I made the purchase.  The ingredients listed are the same as the tea served in the Cheesecake Factory and the Paradise Tropical Tea Company's Passion Fruit Tea.  All you can taste in this product is cinnamon.  The fake purple coloring is kind of weird, too.  We're taking this back to the grocery store.  No passion fruit flavor whatsoever.
1,I love this product but gasped when I saw what Amazon was charging for it; though I did note they are not the direct seller.  I could have probably shopped around but ended up just going to the Kashi Store website where I payed 4.50 a box and since the shipping costs of 6.95 applied for an order up to $20 ordered 4 boxes.  Possibly cheaper elsewhere but that was reasonable to me and I've had a hard time finding it and don't really want to spend any time running around searching for it.  I wouldn't buy it from Amazon though at their crazy price!  Very yummy product though, I do recommend it!  I mix it with yogurt and fresh fruit for a very satisfying breakfast.
1,Absolutely terrible. It's not the same taffy in the picture. It's playdoh colored, overly dyed, and way too soft with flavors that are indistinguishable alone or from each other. I've never had worse taffy. So bad I returned it on principle.
1,Not great for writing on fondant.. Would not recommend.
1,I bought these to try in comparison to Morningstar Farms Crumbles. Nope. I'm not sure what it is, but I don't like the taste or texture of this product. It's not that MS Farms tastes like ground beef, it's that it mimics it very well when mixed into other foods and the taste isn't anywhere near objectionable.		This just didn't hit the mark.
1,Tastes.. just off.
1,Taste like raw coffee beans
1,Not what iecpected
1,This product is only "famous" because of all the (paid) Instagram endorsers. It is absolutely terrible tasting, and I can't believe I was swayed to buy this product. Oh, and it can't be added to iced coffee, which is contrary to what their website claims.
1,These snacks are basically a triangular puffed grain mixed with cocoa, then covered with sesame seeds and sea salt.  The chocolate sea salt mix sounded intriguing, so I decided to give these a try.  The taste is definitely unusual.  I ate the first few and thought they were unusual and tasty.  After the first few, however, I got sick of these really quickly.  There's just too much chocolate in these snacks for my taste.  They're sweet, but not in a good way.  I could eat a few of these (about three), but beyond that I just couldn't handle any more.  Interesting idea, for sure, but they weren't very good in the execution.
1,Nasty tasting.  Waste of money for me.
1,My 12-year old daughter got addicted to this for years.  Unfortunately raisins are HIGH in pesticides, with 26 dangerous residues.  The nursingdegree website listed the brain-damage effect:  "Pesticides have also been linked to brain damage in those who use these chemicals on a regular basis. Gardeners and farmers are the most at risk for developing long-term brain damage and suffering from brain problems such as mild cognitive dysfunction (MCD), which affects your ability to speak smoothly and identify words, colors or numbers. Pesticides may also be to blame for brain damage and developmental problems in children."		I watched in shock and despair as my kid's speech declined, esp. before bed-time, right after a heaping 1/2 cup of raisins. She stutters badly before bed-time, with scary twitching of the neck and jaw. She got angry since she could not control the spasm and twitching.  Pesticides has been linked to stuttering, autism, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's ... all affect neuron control.  We STOPPED this raisins (high in sulfur dioxide, a preservative), plus we switched to organic for the dirty-dozen produce.  My daughter's stuttering is gone, she's now fluent.  After her recovery, we gave her NOW liquid fish oil, since fish oil is known to nourish brain and improve speech.		One famous case:  "In 2004, Paul Francois, a farmer in the Charente area of France, was intoxicated by vapours of the herbicide Lasso Monsanto. He suffered nausea and fainting, and a multitude of other disorders requiring him to stop working for nearly a year: they included STUTTERING, dizziness, headache, and muscle disorders. in 2008. Paul Francis is now considered 50% disabled."
1,Even though there seems to be a filter in each K-cup most of them let grounds through so the coffee cup is full of grounds and often the unit plugs and I have to take it apart and clean it.  I have three cartons of these things that are useless and I will end up tossing them.  It is just too unpleasant to fight them.  One will seem to work and the next one makes a mess.  Sometimes the back pressure even bursts the foil top and then there is a great mess. Other brands work just fine.  I even bought a new Kureg because I thought it must be the maker that was creating the problem.  Not so.
1,Very very weak. The pods are half as full as normal ones.
1,Same as soda pop...
1,Loved them in the past, but have to agree with other purchasers, they are now coming already stale even though the expiration date is 6 months away!!  They used to have a chewy, slight softness when you bit into them, but now they are hard as a rock.  I used to buy them regularly, but no more.  The party's over.
1,Way too salty for my tastes.
1,Came dead and dying.  Couldn't revive them.  Waste of money.  Cannot recommend.
1,Not a lot of flavor one way or the other. Slightly artificial aftertaste, light roast coffee. Why bother if there's no flavor?
1,Okay, but too expensive and too much sugar added!!  Give me regular nuts!
1,Really like the taste of it and I ate one can each day until my coworker warned me about preservative. Then I realized it has hexametaphosphate in it....I stopped eating for a while.
1,Overpriced!! Price has gone up $10!!!!
1,excellent quality and taste. The only shortcoming I believe is that the contents are packaged in bit pieces, almost like crumbs ? There is another seller on Amazon from whom I have purchased this same type product in the past for which the price is about the same, the exception is that the contents are long continuous pieces, therefor I will return to the other vendor in future buys.. If it was a rating on taste and quality I would have given 5 stars, but crumbled pieces knocks the rating down
1,CHAI TEA		I've never been a huge tea drinker, more so coffee, but lately I've been getting more into teas.  Since I love the Twinings Orange Pekoe tea, I figured I'll try the Chai tea. My best friend is Indian and always goes on about Chai tea so I said why not try it.  Well she never said get Twinings but I figured they're a good brand.  Anyhow, so I was totally excited to try this tea.  I made one cup and thought, this is awful!!! I felt like I was drinking a cup of hot water.  I let it sit for awhile to steep some more and even used 2 bags after the first didn't release any flavor and still nothing! I've wasted money on this bcs I won't even try to give it to anyone.
1,I read all of the good stuff associated with Chia Seed. My husband and I have been determined to eat healthier, and go organic when possible. We are succeeding in our endeavors, and thought that this product would fit right into our new lifestyle. I have attempted to get this seed into things that we eat regularly. It just does not work for me. I cannot get past the slime and mouth feel. For those of you who are able to, I think that is wonderful, but I am going to pass on any further use of it.
1,This drink did absolutely nothing for me in terms of energy. It's artificially, chemical-tasting sweet. I'm definitely not a fan...I'm glad I only received one can because there is no way I could have finished off twelve of these things!
1,Beans are good, cans were all badly dented. I ordered these on another occasion with the same results. I won't buy  them again because I'm not sure how safe they are. Damage happened prior to shipping to me.
1,Taste like coconut oil. Wak!!!
1,After reading that some people have issues with Kombucha tea, I Googled it and read some more. I recommend that others do the same before drinking it. I am sure that Yogi Tea produces their Kombucha in a careful environment, but it can cause health problems. It also does not appear to be appropriate for people with Candida despite some claims. It contains alcohol, sugars, fungi, yeast and molds, and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida. I've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps, now that I know more. Again, read up on Kombucha and make your own informed decision.
1,I tossed all of these after trying it twice. Glee Gum is much better. One nice thing is this brand provides waxed papers to put used gum in - need something as it wouldn't come off my finger, Sticks with a vengeance and flavor is fleeting. Looks like rabbit food. The Glee gum is like old Chichlets and good longer lasting flavor. I did keep the waxed paper inserts from each pack before tossing,,,nice to have for the Glee gum too. Gave xtra star for the waxed inserts.
1,Starbucks, bring back Vanilla Via without the Latte!  This is weak, watery, and bland.  I would rather add my own milk or cream.	I am a  big Starbuck's fan by decades.  I loved the plain "vanilla via" on a daily basis.  The latte is for kids who need Lots of Milk.  BRING BACK STARBUCK'S VANILLA VIA (NO LATTE)!!!
1,Very weak.  Cafe Escapes is a much better product.  I have to use two of the Twinings and it doesn't even equal the flavor of one of the Cafe Escapes.  Very disappointed in Twinings!  I will not buy again.
1,Way too heavy when filled, at least four ME.  My hands got REALLY tired from squeezing this gun..sent back .  Items were missing.
1,Good stuff.  Grocery store, 4 bucks.  If you can't get to the store and don't mind paying more than 2x for vinegar, order away!
1,To many unhealthy additives. Will not buy again.
1,I WILL RETURN IT AFTER TRYING ONE CUP.  I LOVE DARK CHOCOLET.  THIS IS NOT IT.
1,If you like putting forkfuls of rubber bands in your mouth, then you'll love these. They really are that bad. Once you rinse and boil the burnt rubber / fish smell off of them, they have no taste or smell. But the texture! Oh, the texture!
1,It didn't work for me
1,Most of the gumballs we broken covered in powder from the broken outer shell. Definitely disappointed since I bought these for my kids. Had to re order from another company.
1,Tasted awful with super gummy texture. I threw away
1,Normally love each and every Kind flavor but these arrived stale and hard as a rock.
1,I guess I should have read about it more thoroughly, but I thought that "zero calories" would also mean zero carbs. WRONG! This has just as many carbs per teaspoon (4) as sugar. So, no benefit from me - I don't care about calories, only carbs.
1,I buy a lot of tahini for many years. Various brands. This one tastes like burned whole wheat bread blended with water. I had to throw it away. Looks like the sesame seeds are way over roasted/burned.
1,So bland tasting that no one in the family liked it, especially the real cheese lovers.
1,Jackfruit is said to taste "meaty." Save your money, this India fruit tastes nothing like meat. I found a recipe for a vegetarian brisket calling for jackfruit. I had to cook the jackfruit for an hour in my sauce to get it tender enough to chop it up. I don't know how people in India fix it, but it's tough and has to be cooked a long time and doesn't fit the bill of tasting like meat. Maybe it's a fruit that you have to acquire a taste for and know how to properly prepare it. There are no recipes on the can.  I will not buy it again.
1,I love tart fruit, including cherries. These taste like cough syrup- not sure we'll even eat them
1,I don't know exactly what this stuff is, but I tried to make nasi lemak (coconut rice) with it and it was a complete failure. First, it prevented the rice from absorbing water. Second, it turned into a thick glue. I haven't had this issue with other coconut cream or coconut milk.
1,Not happy with my order. I ordered this before they changed it to not having the waffle one so I expected for them to just give me the one that is shown now with the ten pieces. Instead I got the other 9 piece bundle which I already had gotten a few days before.
1,I love Pad Thai, but can't always make it out to a restaurant nor make it quickly. I've ordered other ready-to-eat food at Amazon so I figure this can't be that bad, but it is. First, the package smells like it's been sitting on the shelf for a while. If you've ever bought ramen noodle packets and if they've been sitting on shelf for a few months, you know what it smells like.		Then the food itself had a slimy sauce with it that taste too sweet and not much of any other flavor. I don't think you can even doctor it up with shrimp, beansprouts, egg, etc. I may just ditch the flavor pouch and try to eat the noodles with something else :(
1,I don't like the taste
1,After all the great reviews, I was a little surprised at how awful this stuff is.  Granted, taste is subjective, but my husband and I both found it to not only completely lack any flavor remotely related to vanilla, but to carry a very artificial and bitter quality that lingered in our mouths for way too long.  Even eating or drinking a strong tasting substance afterward did not get rid of it.  So, roll the dice and maybe you'll agree with the other rave reviews and maybe you'll waste your money.
1,These were really awful. They looked different but they all tasted the same. Some were already broken, and some had a thin layer, meaning they were old and stale. If I had not taken it as a gift and therefore could not bring it back, I would have returned them. I gladly pay for quality, but these are too expensive for what they are!
1,We have been gluten free for 5 years. This is one of my least favorite brands. Firm, crumbles, taste is ok. Makes awful Mac and cheese because it crumbles into bits.  Instead of firm, I prefer chewy like wheat pasta.	Forget about leftovers! Turns to crumbled mush. Tinkyada is way better.  My favorite is jovial but it's expensive.
1,Tasteless !!
1,Cost too much for what you get...
1,I've been looking for flavored k cups that are more in line with General Foods International Coffee type creations. I love the Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha K cups so when I saw these, I figured I could switch between the two. I usually put a little milk in the cup before making the Cafe Mocha cup so I did that for this one as well. Big mistake. It tasted like caramel flavored milk. Nothing like a coffee and had an almost thick consistency to it. I made another one without the milk and it was almost the same. It is as if they put some caramel flavored powder in the k cup with a whole lot of powdered milk. The Cafe Mocha cup looks like and has the consistency of a hot cocoa drink. This one does not.		If you like a ton of milk in your coffee, you will like these. The flavor is good but I couldn't deal with the thick, milky texture. I tried combining this with a cup of regular coffee in an attempt to cut down on the overwhelming-ness but that just didn't work either. A cup of regular coffee combined with a Cafe Mocha cup works great.		I won't buy these again. I gave it two stars because the caramel flavor is nice and these will be pleasing to the milk overload folks.
1,Has a strong raspberry flavor.  However, the flavor just doesn't taste right to me.
1,Disappointing - hardly any chocolate coating and it's not very good tasting either. The goji berries were rather too dry. I'm going to stick to the higher priced Nuts.com brand and bite the bullet and pay for their shipping. Won't be reordering these.
1,8/6/17  Not impressed with the taste, 'strawberry"??? 20g protein should be more 30/40g of protein, but then you get more calories, so it's a toss up with Designer Whey only 110 calories. Would I purchase it again? No... the price for 12 oz's is to much. You want the protein but not the calories. I normally use EQUATE 30g protien & 6.7 BCAAs per serving chocolate flavor only 180 calories. (vanilla only 140 calories) Why I use the chocolate is I put a full spoon of SPIRULINA covers the taste of SPIRULINA... great for an after work-out drink. I also put a table spoonful of CACAO and I also use Soy Milk. (no milk or water)
1,extremely stale ...not edible!
1,Was not too impressed with this.  I have only ever bought whole been JAmacian Blue Mountain from designated estates and love it.  I've never been to Jamaica and experienced it first hand, so I bet it's even better.  This kurig version tastes nothing like what I've brewed my self.  I thought it was fairly bitter compared to what I've had and did not have that special aroma.
1,Vitamin E which is one of this products ingredients, it mostly, can come from wheat germ oil which HAS Gluten and is NOT GF. Or Soy, which is GF but, many can't tolerate it like me. Occasionally, it comes from other stuff.  Most manufacturer's have no idea where there vitamin E is sourced from. I'm a sensory solution's expert who is also GF intolerant and severely soy intolerant.  ( my blog is at sensorysolutions1 .  com no spaces. I hoped I'd be wrong.  Mostly,  I bought it to review it.  My allergist said cross contamination should never be an issue.  Since I can OnLY have sorta, organic lactose free milk or regular with lactose free pills, I really wanted this too work.  I can't have cashew, rice, hemp, almond, or coconut milks either.  Not that I want the rice or hemp,  I hated the taste. I'm a HF ASD adult who researches this stuff.	  I also thought 2 other ingredients that weren't GF or soy were questionable, problematic ingrediants  for me. One's ingredients name ended with fructose, the other was something similar to Carregan.  I didn't like the strong vanilla smell at first either. I USED THIS TO MAKE BREAD and I tried drinking it. It was awful as milk after refrigeration. And in the bread. It took atleast a few days to tell it caused me issues. But, I think I tasted it pretty immediately in the bread. And it didn't taste real bad in the bread. But, I didn't like it either.
1,I wasn't a fan.  Something gross about this brand made me very bloated.
1,Blue Apron sent 2 of these bars as samples and they were delicious.  I ordered a box off of amazon and the ones that came were so stale they hurt my teeth to chew them!
1,I did not like the taste at all
1,Dark in color, lack sweet flavor of apricots, not worth the extra money. I would pay more, not be bothered by the color, and purchase again IF these tasted like apricots. Taste more like lack-luster prunes.
1,The tea has a weird taste to it, not like any chaga tea I've ever had. It's like they used the actual bark and not the mushroom on it. Or like they found one that fell on the ground and had to clean animal droppings off of it. I wouldn't recommend buying this.
1,To be honest had a pouch and don't like it at all, it's terrible because it has cane sugar and still not sweet enough. It would be nice if it was sweetened with honey and also it is a blend, not just hazelnut spread. Hazelnut taste wasn't good and chocolate taste terrible too. Its surprising how bad the taste was even when I had it by itself so is nothing like the cookie I put it in is the problem or the bread slice, etc. Very bad taste for me.
1,YUCKKK!!!!  Much too sweet, and also gummy.
1,I give 2 stars for fast delivery.  But that is all the tasteless things get. They do smell super good.
1,Taste horrible
1,I tried the White and Sharp Cheddar mix flavor.		Imagine if someone took stale popcorn, then took and dumped on top of that popcorn the powdered cheese from a mac n' cheese boxed mix. That would replicate the taste and experience of eating Orville Redenbacher's Ready to Eat Popcorn White and Sharp Cheddar mix.		This is gluten free. That's the only thing I can think of that could have gone so horribly wrong. It's hard to think of a worse snack product taste and texture.		Two stars because my husband mindlessly ate half the bag while complaining. If you are a mindless eater, you will complain, but you will still eat it. Not a total waste.
1,I will leave my original review on here but ask you to please also read my follow up in the "comments" section.  This company no longer makes a good or healthy product and that is so very sad.		Here is the original review:		I agree with other folks who have reviewed this product that it seems too sweet to be "just plain cranberries", but since the manufacturer says it is pure, it is by far the best source of the daily dose of cranberry juice that some of us "girls" need to keep from getting recurring bladder infections. I have used it for almost 2 years and the quality is always consistent.		I find the manufacturer's recommendation of 2 1/2 T concentrate to one glass of water is much too strong for my taste buds and this is true of all of their flavors.  I use about half that amount.  Still, I recommend all of the Dynamic Health concentrates. The sweeter ones, like blueberry, make fantastic natural, healthy pancake syrup.
1,Could be better.
1,Back in the day, Godiva made decent (B grade) chocolates. I don't know why it is now so mediocre: did they sell out to another company; or are they just saving money on the ingredients. For years it has dropped to the C level where Ghirardelli is, but kept its prices high based on past reputation and the fact that most people haven't eaten anything better than F grade Hersheys and some brands that the FDA does not consider real chocolate. Amazon sells some respectable B grade brands like Valrhona and Callebut. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't sell much in the A grade --Voges is one they carry a good variety of--but for A grade chocolate brands check out some of the high end chocolate sites. A grade chocolates are usually much more expensive than Godiva, even despite Godiva being over-priced.
1,Brown water, so surprising since I adore the Italian roast.
1,Taste is good, but coloring agent red 40-a proven carcinogen makes them a stupid product to eat. If you want to NOT ingest carncinogens.
1,*While I still stand by my original glowing review when it comes to taste and consistency with the chocolate chips, I had to change my rating from 5 to 2 stars because these chips are not reasonably priced for 6 months out of the year. I spent $19.99 on March 30, 2017, and enjoyed Amazon's free two-day shipping. They arrived in my hot and humid city in perfect condition. Today, I went to reorder, and learned that Amazon drops all gourmet chocolate between May and October, and Gerbs currently charges $26.27 for delivery! Sure, they dropped their price to $16.99, but the total price would be $43.26! I don't care how good these chips are, they are not worth $43.		*Original Review*	These are the first non-dairy chips I've ever had, so I can't compare them to other non-dairy chips. However, when compared to regular chocolate chips, these are AMAZING! In fact, I like their texture and taste better than traditional dark chocolate chips. They have a smooth, deep flavor without any bitterness. Their tiny size makes them perfect for adding as a topping to yogurt, peanut butter shakes, cereal, etc. Even though sprinkling them on vanilla yogurt has become favorite dessert,  a teaspoon of these little gems is perfect for quenching a chocolate craving.		Currently, I only use them as toppings or in shakes. If I ever cook with them, I'll update my review.
1,I bought this hoping it tasted better than other sauerkraut I've tried, with no success. If anything I like it less, it's even more bitter/harsh.
1,If you like the flavor of Sumatra coffee -- bold, robust, spicy, chocolate-y -- you won't like these beans.		These beans have no flavor, and taste nothing like the Sumatra beans I've purchased from many other	companies. They taste like cheap Folger's coffee. Don't waste your money.		When I asked Coffee Bean Direct why these beans had no flavor, they blamed Amazon.	Wrong move. Did not offer refund.
1,First of all, I'd like to say the picture on this can is very deceiving.  You do not get long strands of spaghetti as pictured, but short, somewhat thick 2 inch pieces.  The sauce is almost identical to Franco American Spahgettios (from what I can remember before my gluten-free days), so this will appeal to kids more so than adults.  The noodles are rather hard and chewy, so the texture was the worst thing to contend with.  However, it may simply be that gluten free pasta is hard to can without breaking down, so perhaps it has to be made that way.  The can is a single serving size, so is a bit expensive if you factor that in.  In conclusion, if you have a child that has to be gluten free and never had the chance to taste gluten products, this will probably be okay as they won't notice the texture difference.  Otherwise, they may be inclined to spit it out (or at least swallow it like aspirin).
1,I made this on my husband's Kuerig B70 in the 10oz size. The smell was overpowering, I could smell it in my upstairs bedrooms which are no where near the kitchen. The tea itself had a strong chemical-type taste, which in no way resembled either pomegranate, berry, or tea.		I had high hopes for this tea as I love Gloria Jean's mango tea, and enjoyed the mixed flavor packages. Unfortunately, they've recently changed the mixed configuration to include this unpleasant concoction in place of the chai, so I won't be buying that particular package any more.		Unfortunately, I purchased 48 of these, and have tried it 4 times now, hoping it would grow on me. It hasn't, and the smell is now making me queasy. I will second what another reviewer wrote, however, in that it is more palatable cold than warm.
1,2 stars for 2 reasons: 1. The sauces come in bottles that are about the size of your pinky...so you get MAYBE a tablespoon or so out of each one (go ahead and comment about the actual volume of a tablespoon so that everyone on the internet will know you are a huge tool with nothing better to do) and 2. They really aren't that special at all.		I eat a lot of hot sauce and none of these wowed me or tasted like something unique. Do yourself a favor and order some SECRET AARDVARK from Portland, Oregon. It is farrrr better than any of these and comes in really nice sized bottles.		This is not worth the money and Dave's should be ashamed of themselves for obviously overcharging to make a profit.
1,it was wilted
1,Very salty and didn't taste as fresh as unsalted one. I prefer Virginia Diner Gourmet.
1,Do not taste how I remember them... They're nasty but rating is only from my personal taste. Otherwise they came as pictured and described but they're GROSS!!
1,Threw them all away!  There were small bugs in several of the candy bars.  Unbelievable!
1,Too weak - no punch in the morning.  Mixed with a stronger coffee - trying to improve the taste, but didn't work, had to throw all out! What a bummer!
1,I just didn't care for the taste
1,Doesn't work so well.
1,As mentioned, it is overpriced instant coffee. When I bought this one, I was in a hurry and assumed a K-cup that said coffee would not be simply a small amount of instant coffee in a K cup. First taste said "instant". Save your money - it's horrible. Just buy instant and save your money.		Edit: I emailed the company and just received a "form email" not even recognizing the fact they are selling instant coffee in a K-cup. I give up.
1,Cute tin....mints are gross
1,Thought I would try some of this product for a change.  Been buying good jerky for quite awhile on Amazon.  This highly expensive Jerky	at 30.00 a pound and some high reviews,  has to be good.  The jerky that I received tasted like a very, very, very salty black topping tar.	It would "puke a dog eating road kill.  Poorest excuse for beef jerky that I have ever tasted.  I am in NO WAY ridiculing any of the reviewers	that gave it their all.  Just giving my sincere truthful review.  Awful.....
1,There are so many good recipes.  Just make your own.. it will be infinitely better this this overly sweet globule.  It arrived quickly, however tasted awful! The consistency is okay, but just not worth it for me.
1,Tastes pretty terrible, almost like a pumpkin spice candle, it has that strong taste that's too overpowering.
1,I am so sorry to give this a bad rating but they don't work on me, or the effect is so slight that I cannot taste a difference.  Sour things taste sour or sometimes a little less sour, but not sweet.  It's a shame because I want to know what it is like to experience this phenomenon.  :(
1,Over the last few months, the size of the cookie has drastically diminished. The taste is great, but they keep making them smaller and smaller. I call them "the incredible shrinking cookie." I don't know what's happened but the customer doesn't get enough product now.
1,These used to be a great value. They weren't the juiciest but they had flex in them and tasted fine.  My last 2 shipments were cardboard.  Super crunchy and dehydrated and minimal taste.  Avoid.
1,If I could give this product less than one  star I would. This product is TERRIBLE. I have not tried using it for wall paper paste but I'm thinking it might just do the job...or removing varnish from floors perhaps. The scent alone when you open the jar is enough to make you gag let alone putting a spoonful in your mouth. Ugh! Stick to regular peanut butter and just eat less. The only reason this is selling is the marketing which appeals to those of us who watch our sugars and our weight. Don't be fooled by the label. In fact I'm betting the label tastes better than the product.
1,6 eggs in each bag of these contain opened/unwrapped candy just rolling around inside the eggs. Its like this is in all of the bags-I bought several. There are 3 eggs with 4 pcs of Robin Eggs, and 3 eggs with 2-3 pcs of Cadbury mini eggs. None of which was wrapped or bagged. Only the reeses cup minis and kisses are wrapped. Unwrapped/opened candy is a safety issue to children and Hersheys should know better.
1,Taste okay, but not what I expected. They did not boost my energy any during my workout.
1,Was suspecting more spice from Tabasco but not here...typical store brand variety.  Wish it had more heat.
1,smooth. tastes ok. not a strong flavor. seems like a pretty average amount of caffeine, and i steeped it for a long time. won't be buying again.
1,The bananas were completely bruised and brown
1,YUCK I can't believe this was expensive and tastes cheap and  flavorless This is money thrown down the sewer.  Bleh Bleh
1,Healthy, but I'd rather just eat plain carrots and celery as a snack. Just not a good flavor at all.
1,Not best I've ever tasted, and it's culinary grade, so not the best drinking kind.
1,These are really great when they're fresh.  These seemed stale and really dried out even though they were no where near expired.  Cancelled my subscription after the first order.
1,I hated this. I like Dr McDougall's items usually so maybe I am just not an oatmeal lover or something (I do usually eat it a specific kind of oatmeal a specific way) but I didn't care for this at all.
1,My kids love Macaroni and Cheese and I loved that this was healthier because of the white cheddar and whole wheat. But it's SO overly salty and I have to overcook the pasta to get it soft enough for the kids to eat it. I use half the package of cheese powder. Over all, we can't eat it anymore without mixing it in with ground beef to take away some of the saltiness.
1,Plain cups of ramen, beef flavored, in styrofoam cups. This is cheap, easy and quick to make, and filling, although it gets old if you have to eat it by itself three times a day.		If you can afford to add a little real meat or other spices, maybe some soy sauce and so on, you can actually make extrememly palatable noodles from one of these, but for most of us we'll just rip it open and eat it as is, so I can't rate it higher than a two. This is stuff I keep as emergency food just in case I run out of money some month or something; when I actually *want* to eat ramen, I eat better, more expensive ramen, like Nongshim brand.
1,These are not yams. They are sweet potatoes.
1,I personally don't like hard balls.  I like them soft and full of flavor. These balls lacked flavor.
1,No stars!  I have purchased these before but will never again. The product was so dry that I did not even open the bag. The berries simply rattled dryly in the bag, inviting no interest in eating them. Then Amazon says not eligible for return. Feel completely ripped off and now my bodys stress response is producing the very inflammation these Gojis are supposed to help relieve. Maybe Amazon has reached the point of diminishing returns because of their size. I have had several disappointing purchases and service/shipping incidents with Amazon this past quarter. Rethinking Prime after being a Prime customer for half a decade because of this annoyance/rip off and other recent events.
1,This is DISGUSTING!!! Literally a pinch made an entire batch of 12 muffins taste like a chemical waste dump with an aftertaste that was nearly impossible to get rid of. Tried in 1 other recipe with the same result. Then I threw the bag in the trash. I am not one to write purely negative reviews, but there is not anything positive to say about this product.
1,What's so special about a NON-organic coffee that comes from the Americas and Africa? Forget all the claims and fluff on the packaging. This is conventional NON-ORGANIC coffee using Arabica beans. I'd give it 2 stars but the fact that the packaging is full of nonsense that makes people think it is anything more than regular Arabica beans that are grown with all the same pesticides that all the other NON-organic companies, makes me drop it to one star. I hate advertising that IMPLIES something about a product that just isn't true.
1,This was the driest granola bar I have ever eaten. I tried one bar and couldn't even give away the rest. I hate to waste food and throw it away but no one in my household will eat them.
1,Sure, there are no added sugars, but the dates that overpower the flavor are the first ingredient, comprising 21g of sugars/bar, certainly no innocent snack, and with no real flavor in the original flavor. The hazelnuts are lost in that variety, too; had such high expectations and these just fell flat.
1,I wanted to try this substitute for mayonnaise, since nearly all store brands now contain soy.	As I hit myself on the head with this rancid jar of liquefied mayonnaise I should of read the	'critical' reviews first.  Not only does this not taste like mayonnaise, but (as others have said)	this product does not keep long and will soon liquefy into an oily mess that is less appealing	than the bacon grease in the jar on my counter top.  Definitely will still to 'Just Mayo', as	not only does it taste very good but will keep for a long time.
1,I just couldn't eat it.  I've tried a variety of sugar free products and had high hopes for this Jello brand cheesecake pudding.  However, the stuff tasted bad and the consistency reminded me of wallpaper paste.  Sans Sucre has a much better pudding/mousse, made with Splenda, but it is much more expensive.  I thought for sure I'd like this stuff, but now I have a huge box of this that I can't eat.
1,Don't buy these. They're a rip off. Get them cheaper in a grocery store. The shipng is way too much.
1,not enough flavor
1,These had a funny aftertaste, all of them had the same flavor - with a couple being yummy with the aftertaste, but most being bitter or blah, but with the same aftertaste.		I would not buy them again because they all taste the same but with different textures, in general and the aftertaste was just horrible.  It looks great, it was a nice idea, but the taste is what matters and they failed the taste test.
1,This is the most bland boring sauce I've had the misfortune to encounter. It's not the salt (though certainly that's a piece of the puzzle) but the sauce itself tastes very watered down and with just a hint of any spice. And the only spice to taste is a little bit of pepper. That's it. It distinctly lacks in any sort of flavor. Indian flood is very flavorful (usually) so that pretty much makes this one a pass completely.		Don't bother. Find a good Indian recipe on the net and make your own or find a good Indian buffet.
1,I normally love Thai Kitchen products, but this one is a miss. The taste is okay and recognizably green curry but the volume of flavor is quite muted and there is ZERO heat despite the 3-pepper rating on the label.  Judging from other reviewers here, I'm not alone.		Skip this and try something else.
1,So I really wanted to try this product to avoid consuming calories late at night and was disappointed. The noodles are in a liquid that smells terrible. When you wash the noodles as directed the smell does not go away. I tried everything on the noodles to avoid the smell, hot sauce, tomato sauce, a bunch of spices, and gravy.. Nothing worked. I had to force myself to finish eating them because I hate wasting food. The concept is great but they are very unappetizing..
1,I love the product.  I do NOT love receiving it 3 days AFTER it expired.  Shame to send expired goods -- especially to a military address.
1,I wanted to like this mac and cheese replacement. It is less expensive than another one I'd tried previously, so I gave it a try. There was no way!  I ate a few spoonfuls and threw it all away. It was pasty in texture and taste even with rice milk.  I've just reordered the more expensive Namaste brand and I'll save it for when I really need a mac and cheese fix. The Namaste brand to me was very delicious and satisfying for a new vegan.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Namaste-Foods-Gluten-Free-Say-Cheez-Pasta-Dish-9-Ounce-Bags-Pack-of-6/dp/B000LKXG8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Say Cheez Pasta Dish, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>
1,They came all melted and stuck together so I was very disappointed.
1,Short but not sweet - I'll never buy food items from Amazon again. Six cases of canned soup were severely dented! Replacement shipment also dented. Cans were not damaged in shipping. Dents were at random positions not matching as if impacted one on the other!! Twelve cases and only 28 cans safe to consume. I'll never trust Amazon for food products again. Too bad because the soup is delicious and not available in stores in my area.
1,Couldn't even drink it it was so gross! Threw it away.
1,Bag torn and gummies were hard not fresh.....these were a gift I was so embarrassed when I was told
1,Flavor is too mild.  Needs more salt and bolder vinegar.
1,I expected "Puffed Rice"		I received WHOLE GRAIN PUFFED BROWN RICE it is awful.,I wanted the WHITE Puffed RICE I remember as a kid. This stuff is like sawdust. waste of $  at over $5 a small bag. Tempted to send back or feed the birds!
1,Before purchasing, know what you're getting....I couldn't stand the smell let alone putting it in my food....I figured, oh I like anchovies....good God, no! 9 bucks down the drain..... sometimes you walk into a Chinese restaurant and there's an overpowering stench....THIS is that smell
1,The Grove Square Cider Mix tastes more like sugared water than cider. Even with decreasing the water feed it still wasn't tasty. Additionally, the powder would get clumped inside the coffee maker and I had to take it apart several times to clean the needles and other parts in order to make other beverages. I threw the remaining cups away because they were more of an annoyance than a treat.
1,Don't know why I have to write another review when the first one was accepted. I did not want a case. However, I am disabled and my shopper retired so I had no choice. First, the expiration date was less than 8 weeks from the day I received this case.  Amazon quickly corrected this.  I usually buy the "no salt added" spinach.  For some reason this did not taste good.  Also, there was much more water in this can.  So much I could not squeeze it all out.  Buyer beware when you purchase canned goods through Amazon.  Two out of two cases of different foods were unacceptable.
1,Sincerely Nuts raw pecans seem older.  I also have a batch of raw pecans from "We got nuts" and they seem so much more fresh compared to these.		Sincerely Nut's pecans are faded in color, softer and not very strong flavor.  it's like they are nuts from 1-2 years ago.		They are still edible		These should be discounted to half price.
1,These taste really good, my child loves the taste, but they raise her blood sugars. so its a no go for us.
1,i am sorry but this isn't for me.
1,I really thought this would taste better than it did. Huge disappointment. The smell reminds me of a pumpkin scented candle. Not very appealing.
1,Stale taste and smell
1,They have changed the product recipe:		The bars are significantly smaller, although they are using the same wrapper that now is twice as big as the dwarf fig bars.		The baked wheat outside is now chaulky, dry, compared to the former chewy outside.		Are they even baked in the USA anymore? Only says distributed from Reno, Nevada.		The inside is now more sugar, less fruit and more water, not rich and chewy like they used to be.		Going to the dogs here Nature's Stingy Bakery...
1,The Cinnamon Taste In This Syrup Is Very Overpowering. It's Like Sucking On A Cinnamon Stick. We Tried Different Ways Of Fixing It But The Cinnamon Taste Could Not Be Diluted. We Could Not Even Taste The Brown Sugar In This. We Love Cinnamon But This Was Just Too Much. Someone Who Loves The Taste Of Bitter Cinnamon Will Love This Syrup.
1,This product says it creates 'creamy yogurt'.  I've been making yogurt for years and I've never seen such runny yogurt.  This stuff passes through cheese cloth like liquid.  It's about the consistency of thick buttermilk and I've tried every trick I know.  I've even tried using a double amount of the starter.  Just not making anything I would recognize as yogurt.  If you want thick, creamy yogurt, look elsewhere.
1,This is very old roasted coffee from Koffee Kult.	The web description of this coffee said that it has BIG BODY, LOW ACIDITY AND "CRISP" SWEET FLAVOR.	However, it was strange that the company did not describe any other important flavors that a good coffee must have, such as caramel, chocolate, apple, peach, well balance...etc.		Anyway, I grinded 11 grams of coffee beans and used a cup that can hold 210 grams of water for cupping purpose. I measured the ground weights exactly and I followed SCAA cupping protocols. Immediately, I realized that there was absolutely NO AROMA from the ground coffee at all which indicates that this coffee is roasted quite a while ago. I poured hot water and waited few min to "Break the cup" which means breaking top layer of the coffee ground and smell the aroma. As I had expected, again, no Aroma at all. Definitely old beans. Finally cupping which I knew already that it was useless. But I gave it a try. Zero flavors. there was no "crisp" sweet flavor and No Big Body. Less Acidity, yes. Basically this coffee was FLAT, complete deprived of any good flavors that good and freshly roasted coffee should have.		Then only thing that I was glad that I did not pay the full price and shipping.	Probably I will be using the left over coffee for "Flavored cold brew" and I wonder that even that might not come out good enough to drink.		Also, on the website coffee description, it says : Artisan roasted fresh to perfection on our small batch roasters, and roasted immediately prior to packaging. Every bag is consistently the same with our roasting profile system!.		First, I thought that they roast the coffee I ordered prior to shipping out to me, but, AFTER READING THE DESCRIPTION MORE CAREFULLY, "roasted immediately prior to PACKAGING", it does not say "prior to shipping via Amazon Prime", so i guess it is my bad to miss-understood. They might have roasted beans and packaged into bags immediately, but no one knows how long those coffees were sitting in the warehouse because there is no roast date indicated on the bag.		Koffee Kult was a big disappointment for me in so many levels.
1,allergic to these and it gets stuck in my intestines/stomach and causes bloating and pain
1,This is the worse tee i have ever drank. No flavor, no aroma, no taste - one word : horrible. Walmart tee for 1/3 of the price is 10 times better .
1,These do not taste good. I will not be buying again.
1,Bitter tasting
1,These are beyond horrendous. When you think of truffles - generally a person would have a face of delight since it would be a treat. However these taste sour, foul, and even rancid. I immediately spit out the first bite (I have a courtesy 2 bite rule for every and any new food I try - however I could not fathom trying a second bite). It was that bad. Maybe I got a bad batch? Expiration date still had another year to go so I'm not too sure about that. Regardless these taste disgusting in my honest and humble opinion.
1,I didn't like the flavor very well.  It has a kind of weird after-taste that lingers on the tongue.  I wouldn't recommend this product.
1,I only purchased this "plastic food," as I call pre-packaged stuff, because my kitchen is currently out of commission. I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed these pasta bowls. I thought the taste was good--and I kicked mine up by adding a sprinkling of red pepper flakes and parsley. You could also add grated cheese.  They were quick and easy to prepare and the sauce was a nice consistency and not gummy like sauces that rely too heavily on cornstarch to thicken them. I thought the Progresso quality was well represented in this product and I will definitely buy them again. That is a rare recommendation from me as I prefer to cook everything from scratch. I am not sure why the other reviewer hated the taste so much, but to each his own. (It might be the pronounced bell pepper presence.)  :)		UPDATE 5/23/16: Just read an article in the news stating that YELLOW 6 DYES (among others) "... ARE TAINTED WITH CANCER-CAUSING CONTAMINANTS." [Caps added by me for emphasis.] I then went online and found this information was confirmed by the site Foodsafetynews, for one--which also slammed the FDA for knowing this information, but doing nothing to protect consumers. THAT story was written in July, 2010!!! BE PROACTIVE! INVESTIGATE WHAT YOU EAT!  WE CANNOT RELY ON FOOD MANUFACTURERS OR THE FDA TO ACT IN THE HIGHEST AND BEST GOOD OF CONSUMERS, IMHO.
1,Didn't care for any of the flavors.
1,Very tasty coffee. But shipping nearly doubled the price. My fault for not checking shipping fee. I won't order it again!
1,Too pricey ,,,,,
1,This was leaking when I received it. Inside the lid there was a layer of paraffin and the outer seal was inefficient.
1,not too pleasant to my taste. I may be too prone to English Breakfast. Always a matter of personal taste.
1,This tea has only a miniscule amount of the so called berry plum flavor! It is bland but it does taste healthy. So if you buy it buy it for health reasons and not taste. Taste you will not get in this tea. Try their raspberry gogi berry green tea! Now that has excellent health benefits coupled with a nice fruity taste! Not this one "ugh"! Amazon prices are more reasonable than the company that makes this tea "Republic of Tea" so buy it here and not from their website! Amazon offer free 2-day shipping for a total price of tea & shipping together cost only $11.99. Republic of Tea cost 21.00 to ship 2-day Air shipping and that doesn't include the price of the tea!
1,These were awful!! No banana flavor at all. I eat a Paleo diet so I am use to no artificial ingredients. Bread went straight to the trash!
1,Got two bad cases in a row fulfilled by Amazon.  Then also from a local grocery store and a couple cans at a gas station.  All within July-August. I had been drinking these for a month or so when I got the bad cases/cans.  The viscosity is usually nothing and leaves the palate clean but the bad ones were syrupy in the mouth and left an after taste.  They also didn't give me any energy like I had grown accustomed to from the very consistent 'good' cans prior to this string of bad, most-likely-heat-damaged-sucralose cans.  I'm guessing they can't keep their stock in cool enough storage in midsummer so they get baked above whatever temperature sucralose or other ingredients in this concoction break down at.  Legitimate liver-pain came from drinking these, as well.  I got refunded for both cases by Amazon but they didn't seem too happy after the last one and I'm getting a feeling they won't be too kind if I complain about any more cases in the future which honestly wouldn't be my fault if that did happen.  So I'm not buying from Amazon anymore.  Sorry seller, but get your stuff settled.  And Amazon, keep your consumable products in climate-controlled storage...people out here are getting physically hurt by tainted and rancid products.  Oh, this stuff also has too strong a banana-note in teh fruitpunch flavoring which after a while makes my body odor smell like a sunbaked dumpster.  PEEYOO.  Change the formula, Rockstar, this is great stuff when it's not rancid!!!  240mg caffeine 4 lyfe.
1,not very good, with such a crowded protein bar market you have to taste good now too. this falls short, i would not recommend them.
1,Very Dry and tasteless, No butter flavor. Will not buy again. All the kernels did not pop.
1,I have a vegetarian who is also a tea lover in my house, so I thought this would be perfect.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  If you are looking for weak soup broth, this is it. If you are looking for savory tea, it's definitely a miss!
1,The bag I got was not airtight and the chocolate was stale nine months before best buy date. From Terrific Deals, an Amazon vendor.
1,Never expected such a variety would all be BOLD AND STRONG. Assumed there would be a variety of strengths.  Would not recommend.
1,I love some of the lavazza coffee like the creme, but this made one of the worst cups of coffee I have ever had. I you like bitter then this is for you...
1,I had too much trouble finding good directions and getting the information I needed to use these kefir grains.
1,can't believe this is expensive chocolate. a Dove bar is much preferable. In fact, most any chocolate is because it's CHEAPER. still can't believe I spent so much money and that Amazon would promote such a horrible product. I kept thinking "the next one will be better" and they weren't then the box was empty and I couldn't return it. Don't make the same mistake. I could have gone to our locally owned store that makes truffles and everything chocolate from scratch, supported them, spent less and had a wonderful treat!
1,I thought that I'd really enjoy these but they're so overrated!! I usually like gummi bears but these just aren't that good, I could have bought Walmart's brand and been just as happy! I will now be ordering these or buying these again EVER!! I spent too much and they didn't taste that good, too bad I didn't know how awful they were before I bought... Yuck a real waste of money!!:(
1,Terrible! It has the consistency of pudding (it jiggles) and does not taste anything like peanut butter. I find it extremely salty as well! Just gross.
1,I was really looking forward to these because skinning hazelnuts is a chore. Unfortunately, they smelled and tasted rancid with some tasting really bitter and others tasting sour. I bought some from another supplier. Hopefully, theyll be better. If not, I may have to stick to buying skin on hazelnuts available locally. Given all the positive reviews for this product, its possible I received a bad batch.
1,Has a horrible taste, would never buy again .
1,Came with mold on one side and a terrible smell.
1,Maybe it's a matter of taste, but it has a strange flavor to me.
1,To bitter for me...
1,The candy coating was so thick and so hard that we feared breaking our teeth and threw them away unused.	As if it mattered, there was no almond taste discernible.
1,Coffee is great, however about TWICE what I can pay at the store on sale. Not real impressed, I thought it would be a bigger bag for the price.
1,GET THE "BUBBLE YUM Bubble Gum Original, 10-Piece)", IF ONE DOESNT MIND A FEW EXTRA CAVATIES ALONG THE WAY. ...ITS A WHOLE LOT BETTER!!
1,I don't like Roads End's cheese sauce.  It needed at least twice as much liquid as they say to add.  Even then the sauce was gloppy and didn't taste particularly cheesy.  I really wanted to love this as the price is so much better than Namaste Foods mac & cheese.  Namaste Foods product is far superior.  I also tried Edward & Sons cheese flavored mashed potatoes which contains Roads End cheese sauce and it wasn't very good either.  The other varieties of Edward & Sons potatoes were really delicious so the problem is Roads End's cheese sauce mix.  So disappointing.		The pasta cooked up well though.  I wish it were wheat free though.
1,Dislike this product. I had sore throat after drinking this tea.. Ordered 6 boxes..
1,This hot sauce was just not for me. There's something off that I don't like about it. Some weird flavor. The spice is definitely there though so that's a plus.
1,I've tasted many other brands of cocoa hazelnut spreads but this one is the only one that is not solid at room temperature. Aside from arriving with an open seal & content-contaminated exterior, the Nutiva Hazelnut spread tasted a tad bitter, like unsweetened dark chocolate, and needs dripping precautions. I usually can tell when a food item has inulin in it (this one does), but I did not detect it in the Nutiva. I do not understand why it has flour as a listed ingredient since flour is a thickening agent and this product is more like a thick syrup, but the label lists flaxseed flour as an ingredient.		The non GMO icon is a welcome advertisement. One would not expect chocolate hazelnut spreads to contain gluten or any flour product, so the gluten free icon was a red flag for me to examine the ingredients. The vegan icon is misleading since the label states that the product may contain traces of milk solids (not vegan).		The pics show what the Nutiva jar was like when it arrived, the open Nutiva contents beside an open jar of Giant Food's brand Nature's Promise organic chocolate hazelnut spread, and the label of the Nature's Promise, which has different ingredients but offers a spreadable consistency.
1,Too coarse, I don't have a grinder, so I gave this to a friend who could use it.
1,I really wanted to like this product since I LOVE egg nog flavor especially at the holidays. It just tasted artificial to me, and not at all egg-nog Y! Perhaps this is a really individual thing, since some folks reviewed this highly...in fact that's why I purchased it in the first place. I would not order it again.
1,This is like jellied plastic
1,You might as well drink a can of soda because you're getting the same main ingredients, high fructose corn syrup. Enjoy your pre-diabetes.
1,I was hoping that I could use it to flavor Ensure Vanilla. It doesn't work. After sitting in the refrigerator for a long time the strawberry fragment separated from the liquid and stirring doesn't work. Maybe it was never intended to flavor drinks?
1,Great tasting bold coffee ,I always enjoy it
1,When the box arrived, one of the cups had broken open and spilled everywhere, yuk!  I figured I would eat that one first but it was filled with mold as were a few more that hadn't broken open.  The fruit in the non-moldy ones is mediocre and not nearly as good as the ones I get from the local store.  And the lid doesn't actually fit on the cup, it barely fits on the label which is barely held in place so you can't eat half and save the rest.  It would have been a good idea but these don't compare to the ones at the store.
1,Did not taste the same nor have the same thickness. Have bought dressing from Olive Garden so know what I'm saying.
1,These candies are great, but the price...	These cost $2.78 on Walmart.com I just cannot pay the markup.
1,These were disgusting.  I ended up throwing them out.
1,Terrible de-caf. Will not buy again. Yuck!
1,Just awful, doesn't tast like sour patch kids, barely tasted like orange, and the taste fades almost immediately. Didn't finish the pack, 3 slices and it was gone. Really some of teh worst tasting gum I have ever had.
1,Hard as a rock!  Even boiling water would not reduce the clumps to liquid/cream.  May have been due to winter freezing weather temperatures but...unusable and I'm requesting a refund.
1,hard on inside and expired will get from store from now on
1,I'm looking for a bold decaf and this was suggested to me.  Seeing the words "Espresso" and "Extra-Bold" in there I figured it had to have some "punch."  Sadly no. "Extra-Bold" it is not.  I'd have trouble even suggesting "Boldly-Mild."  I have to set my machine to the lowest of the 3 settings and it's still not a satisfying coffee.  I wish it was possible to have a mixed box of decaf coffees to sample: Buying 24 or 48 K-cups at a time is not the best way to try out the unknowns!  :-)
1,Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!
1,There is No Expired Date on the package for these two items.
1,These chocolates contain soy, which I can't have,  so I wasted money!
1,Tasted very bad
1,This particular blend of Berbere is VERY spicy, but doesn't have as much flavor as other brands I've tried. My dishes were lacking flavor and were so hot I could hardly eat them! Quite disappointed.
1,Too sweet and I try to drink healthier energy drinks that are sugar free. Better and healthier options out there.
1,I hate to be the holdout here, but I thought that this was NOT a good Basmati rice. I can buy it in one lb containers from my grocer, and their rice tastes better. My grocer's Basmati rice also comes out fluffier when cooked. If I get it on sale, the grocer's rice is also cheaper. I think that if you look around, you can do better.
1,Buy the box-of-envelopes version of this product, it's literally half the price per ounce of product.
1,Unutterably, indisputably vile. There are no words for exactly how bad this abomination is. I'm perfectly okay with fake lemon flavor, this is not the problem - it is the flavor of the lemon bars as a whole that's so incredibly awful. It has a nauseating aftertaste that just won't quit. It is, without a doubt, the absolute worst baking mix I have ever experienced by a longshot. Almost any other dessert mix on the planet would be better.
1,Can dented badly.
1,3rd time ordering this from Amazon Fresh; it was half the normal size and by the end of the day had brown rotten juice at the bottom of the bag it was shipped in.
1,These have almost zero flavor at all, you have to really strain to taste any hint of cheddar cheese flavor!  If your main focus in purchasing products for your family is primarily to make sure that they are 'ORGANIC", then you may feel good about this product. For me, taste is equally important and these cheddar bunnies have very little flavor period!
1,Weak and watery compared to other chutneys. I was not impressed.  The product seem to be under cooked so that the fruit was whole and the liquid was still very apparent. The two had not meshed
1,Did not like this but my husband did.
1,I fixed up my standard drink: two ounces of raspberry syrup in a pint glass of water.  I have to say, all I tasted was sugar.  If I hadn't known I was pouring from the raspberry-labeled bottle, I wouldn't have guessed raspberry, I'm not even sure I would have guessed fruit.  I like raspberries, and I, unlike many people, eat them without sugar ... their tartness is part of their attraction for me.  My "gold standard" for raspberry syrup is the "Marco Polo" brand I used to be able to find more easily ... no mistaking the raspberry identity, and no overwhelming the fruity raspberry taste with excess sugar ... deliciously intense, and refreshingly tart.  This falls so far short of that, that I literally poured the second half of my drink down the sink, because I couldn't stand there drinking tasteless sugar water. Now I have to figure which of my recipes use sugar syrup (not many, I can tell you that!) and in which of them I can use the remaining 23 ounces.
1,I have been eating these bars for a long time and love them.(Dark Chocolate Mocha Almond). I just removed them from my Subscribe and Save list because I broke an implanted tooth eating them. My implants were under warranty, so I didn't have to pay for the new tooth. I have been eating them on a daily basis and will miss them, but my teeth come first.
1,taste like I imagine styrofoam tastes like
1,Hmmmm.  I've happily used other Frontier products.  When replacing things in my kitchen, I'm trying to buy fair trade and cleaner.  I'm disappointed.  It smells WONDERFUL, but I have cinnamon every single day in my coffee, and there is NO NO NO cinnamon taste to this product at all.  Makes me suspicious, can't help it.  Can't return since I tossed the packaging, but I'm sort of considering tossing the product and buying something else.... went back after the fact and read reviews and I see recent reviews where others noticed the same.
1,The flavor was weaker than I get from McDonald's  I brewed on 10 ounce.
1,Tasted funny when I opened the box. Musty/off tasting. Had to throw away. Sell by date is February so it was not expired.
1,Didnt bake up well. dried out my brownies and gave me terrible stomach ache,	dont think this is the sweetner for me, i think ill just stick to coconut sugar or agave or myple syrup, too bad because i had high hopes for this	i did buy another brand that has monkfruit in it and it seemed to be ok but i didn't bake with it ao maybe thats the key
1,I used to like Designer Protein but they have changed.  It tastes horrible.  My wife also will not drink it because she think it tastes bad so it not just me..  It honestly tastes like chocolate flavored stevia.  If you ever just tasted stevia by itself then you know what this tastes like.  Stevia is what is used as a sweetener and I think they over did it
1,Waste...Didn't work
1,Somebody handed me one of these at a picnic, and it looked interesting -- basically, it was like eating jam that had been left on a plate and dried into a concentrated and gelatinous lump of  -- well....  So I looked at the box the next time I went to the store.		Here's what it's a lump of:		--Grapes From Concentrate,  THAT'S OKAY WITH ME	--Sugar,  ALSO OKAY WITHIN LIMITS	--Maltodextrin,  ANOTHER SUGAR	--Corn Syrup,  ANOTHER SUGAR -- THE MOST UNHEALTHY OF ALL THE SUGARS -- SO UNHEALTHY THAT THE USA IS THE ONLY --THE ONLY -- THE ONLY -- FIRST WORLD COUNTRY LEFT THAT HAS NOT BANNED IT'S USE IN FOOD.	--Pears From Concentrate,  OKAY -- 1 MORE ACTUAL FRUIT	--Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed Oil,  BASICALLY 1 STEP FROM PLASTIC, AND CONSIDERED AS BAD OR WORSE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH THAN TOBACCO	--Carrageenan,  COLOR	--Citric Acid,  PRESERVATIVE	--Acetylated Mono and Diglycerides,  WHO KNOWS	--Sodium Citrate,  ANOTHER PRESERVATIVE	--Malic Acid,  ANOTHER PRESERVATIVE	--Xanthan Gum,  HELP KEEP THE PLASTIC FROM BECOMING BRITTLE	--Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid),  CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT -- AND ALSO A PRESERVATIVE	--Locust Bean Gum,  AGAIN, MOISTURIZER FOR THE PLASTIC	--Natural & Artificial Flavor,  ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR?  AREN'T WE TIRED OF THIS BY NOW?	--Potassium Citrate,  SOUNDS LIKE POTASSIUM AND CITRUS FRUIT -- BUT IT'S NOT	--Color (Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1)  COLOR, COLOR, AND MORE COLOR -- ISN'T FRUIT PRETTY COLORFUL ALL BY ITSELF?		So fruit -- which is already colorful and already sweet, is puree'd with enough sugar to kill ants, then dosed up with preservatives so it has a half-life of 200 years -- AND they throw in partially hydrogenated fats (which are so bad for your that they have been banned in several states and countries around the world -- and will be banned by the rest before it's over) -- and what have you got?  Something nobody in their right mind would eat and call "fruit".		This is not fruit -- it's candy.  And as candy -- it's not even good candy.  Why not go for a piece of real fruit followed by a bit of REAL 60-75% chocolate made with REAL sugar.  Chocolate has the highest concentration of anti-oxidents on the planet -- so many that it has a naturally ultra-long shelf life with no zero- none- nada- not-a-bit of preservative or partially hydrogenated anything.		I'm sorry, but I've just about reached the end of my patience with these monolithic companies that market empty calories laced with poison under innocent sounding names and cute, brightly colored boxes with cartoon animals on them.		And don't be fooled by anything that says "Zero Grams of Trans Fat" --if it has partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients list -- then they're splitting hairs with the labeling laws.  Partially hydrogenated oil IS Trans Fat.		If they make the portion size small enough that 1 portion has less than .5 grams of partially hydrogenated fat (even if the portion size is only 4 grams of the food)  -- then they are within the law to lie to you and advertise their product as having 0-grams of trans fat!  Can you believe it?  Whatever happened to the spirit of the law?		Money happened.		If a portion size is 4-grams, and each 4-grams of a 180-gram box contains .4-grams of partially hydrogenated fat -- that means the box could contain as much as 18-grams of TRANS FAT.  It's a con.  It's a lie.  It's trying to pass a lie that falls within the letter of the law off as the truth.  I've actually read boxes where the serving size was 2 crackers -- little tiny crackers -- that together weighed less than 9 grams.  That's less than 1/3 of an ounce.  Who is that supposed to be a serving for?  Barbie?		And if you buy these things and feed them to your children -- then you're buying the lie because it's easy, pretty, well marketed, sweet (no kidding) and without a shadow of thought or conscience.
1,Updating this review; while I loved the first batch i got, the 2nd batch was filled with some pieces of black gunk. Not sure if they were dead bees or what but since the first package was so good I went ahead and ate around them. I then had terrible nausea for 10 days and will definitely not be buying again.
1,It has a sweeter in it
1,These are pretty good.  I think there is way too much chocolate. I'm not even sure that all of the chocolate balls actually have a bean inside.  The chocolate is mediocre quality and I would call it more semi-sweat than dark.		They are shipped from "It's Delicious" ( NOT from King of Sweets Online as it says). They did a great job with the shipping- heat-shielded package and ice pack.
1,Didnt care for the flavor. Didnt taste like onions. The taste was off putting to me. The peanuts themselves seem fresh.
1,I DESPISE COMPANIES WHO MANIPULATE WORDS SO IT DISPLAYS WHAT A CUSTOMER WANTS TO SEE, THEIR UNDERLYING AND PATHETIC!!		It states "Free shipping", but it's actually $8.00!!		It's Companies and Individuals like these who create their own downfall, and than later they wonder why, duh!!		What THEY are doing is manipulating rapport(natures subconscious connection) whether it be food, relationships, world news or whatever, IF you seduce, manipulate or use nature to take advantage of anothers spirit, IT WILL RETURN BACK TO YOU, BUT IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SCENERIO OR VIEW-POINT THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT!!!		You can deny it, BUT, YOU CAN NEVER DENY YOUR OWN SUBCONSCIOUS, CAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT ACCUMULATES AND MANIFEST!!  HAVE FUN ON THAT!!
1,These have a Hint of mint.
1,This is my first time trying Stash Tea.  Was quite disappointed.......I could taste the distinct matcha flavor which did not coexist harmoniously with the peach flavor.  The ginger flavor was not strong enough to help the strange balance of the other two flavors.  What a shame!  I was really hoping to enjoy this new tea :(
1,I associate Godiva brand with good chocolate and now requiring a low-carb or no-sugar diet expected a lot from this product. It was not very good. But possibly it was not Godiva's fault. The dark chocolate was mottled white on the surface like super stale chocolate, and that's exactly what it tasted like. The expiration date was NOT expired, but chocolate can be similarly destroyed by improper or unsafe storage methods. But as the vendor was Godiva Chocolatier itself, either way, it's their fault, and for the first time I find myself leery of their product. Though it did remind me twenty-odd years ago I saw my first and only living worm or moth larvae in a Godiva bar. Maybe I'm just a slow learner.
1,Just "tastes bad"!!!
1,No matter how long you bake still appears raw.
1,Would have been great without the fake smoke. I have to read things more carefully
1,I fed these nuts to the squirrels in my yard.
1,I didn't like this following the directions the gravy is very thin and I didn't care for the taste.
1,I was so excited as I opened the box and aroma drifted up and out.  But the excitement ended there.  I brewed the first cup and thought 'this can't be!'  Where did the flavor go?  So brewed a second cup with sweetener and without cream with the same tasteless results.  I am so bummed.  I've had other Camerons and had great success but not with this flavor.
1,Overly expensive ... save your hard earned money and get Truvia instead at a quarter the cost of this stuff.
1,Haven't actually eaten any yet.  Nice food storage though!
1,IN BEEF COLLAGEN CASING, this is the last item in the ingredients list, yet it is not listed in the product description, nor does it appear on the first customer pic in the review section.  NOT EVERYONE EATS COWS, so it is very important to provide an accurate list of ingredients.  I'm wondering if this new beef-containing version is why customers are complaining the taste is so different than what they previously ordered.  What a waste of money.  Never buy again from this company.
1,Got this to use specifically for breakfast hotcakes and tastes like cardboard. Can't taste the vanilla bean at all.
1,Lost flavor right away.	I appreciate what they are trying to do tho
1,Eating this stuff. The grains are hard as pebbles. The whole family here voted "Horrible". We will use for bird feed.
1,very disappointed in this product	the  bottles are lovely however
1,Initially these seemed great but I got so jittery from them I had to stop. My husband just didn't feel well either.
1,Not enough filling
1,does nothing for me.
1,Bought 6, opened 2, and threw away 4. Fishy smell and taste. Only opened 2nd can to give product the benefit of a doubt, but the second was as bad as the first. However, the Albacore Tune and Alaskan Pink Salmon put out by this same company are excellent products. Hard to believe products came from the same place.
1,I hate to give it a bad review, as the Amazon Customer Service Rep was more than generous with refunding me without requiring I return the product.  Yet, I would be remiss NOt to state that it tasted NOTHING like pan sausage.  I tried and tried to like it, even though it didn't resemble the taste I was expecting, but it was too 'odd' for my taste.  I Googled "Jimmy Dean" sausage to find what seasonings I could add to it to make it taste better.  Haven't purchased them yet, but hoping I can make it edible.  Though vegan for almost 2 years, I like to have grits and sausage on the occasional, lazy Saturday morning.  So, we'll see it souping it up with spices can help.
1,Unhealthy! These almonds are sprayed with a chemical which is carcinogenic, this is how Kirkland pasteurizes their almonds, the other way which is better, is steaming the nuts.  Some companies use steaming, you have to check with the company itself.		These almonds are pasteurized using a chemical called PPO (propylene oxide) which is sprayed on the almonds. PPO is a carcinogenic. This chemical was used as a racing fuel until it was banned for safety reasons. I found this out by doing some research; you can also check this by calling the company, Kirkland.
1,This came as part of the most recent 40-count coffee k-pod pack i purchased from amazon.com. there has been a lot of hype about it being terrific. I was disappointed however when i tried it and it didn't live up to all of the great reviews about it! barely any maple flavor at all and that which it had was so subtle, i barely tasted it! won't be buying this flavor again
1,I feel very ripped off by the keurig company.	My brewer stopped working and now I am stuck with a bunch of K-cups that I can not use.	To make matters worst, the newer better brewer that keurig makes does nto use k-cups.	I am angry.  Sorry I am taking it out on you but there is nothing elase I can do.
1,This review is for the Barilla Tri-Color Pasta, Rotini, 12 Ounce (Pack of 16)		Only one 12 ounce box not 16		Grocery store quality. Not nearly as good as italian made.		Pricey for a singel box
1,This is a grainy (as opposed to meaty) textured, very bland flavored product! It is nothing like other European blutwurst, which is much, much better.
1,I am giving two stars because the flavor is exactly like a glazed donut, but good gods, the texture of the glaze is awful. It is thick, and more resembles a thinned fondant texture than the light and flaky glazed donut texture you are looking for. The donut itself is very dense, and while I can see where heating these u might make it more edible, for me, the texture is just too off-putting. If you don't mind the texture, the flavor is there. These were a disappointment to me, unlike the Katz Gluten Free Chocolate Covered Donuts.
1,Not great.
1,not good taste like grainy sugar  I don't know why i have to write more to get this in, it is stupid and makes many now want to even write
1,I really wanted this to be great, but was really dissapointed! It is not very sweet at all - needs almost twice as much VitaFiber for a recipe that calls for any other sweetener.
1,The paleo pancake mix was too thick when following mixing instructions so that the cooking was uneven. Water was added so that it could be poured on the griddle, but the flavor was off-putting, even for something that is supposedly healthy for you.		The texture was manageable. Non-paleo syrup was used and the cakes were given to children without a word said. After one bite they winced and refused to eat more, even though it was drenched in Aunt Jemima.		On top of this, the current price is twenty-three bucks for a three-pack. Seriously?
1,Caused extreme stomach pains. I love this brand but absolutely hate this flavor because it cost me several days of severe stomach pain and doctor bills.
1,These have a strange artificial kind of taste. Can't put my finger on it. The texture is also not really like fudge, but rather a caramel. Not at all what I was expecting for "vanilla fudge".
1,No longer juice.
1,When I ordered, I thought this was a chocolate drink that I remembered from earlier times.  It's not the same, so I will not reorder.
1,The previous reviewer rated this five stars without even trying it. I tried it and it was friggin terrible. Horrible taste. It didn't taste like anything asian ive ever tried. I was shocked at how bad it was since their southwest spice is so good. But this one is so bad i wouldnt even give it to a soup kitchen. Im returning it to walmart.
1,Ordered several times....often bananas are really overripe....have to throw out after 1 day.
1,the actual box of candy is much smaller then the small box shown,  that is outer packaging to make it look bigger and it was not very tasty, very bland.		not a success
1,There are definitely issues with the banana nut bars. My first order was stale and I returned for replacement. The replacement order contains rancid nuts. Ive only had this problem with this particular flavor. Ive thrown them away.
1,UGG This stuff reminds me of the soda water used to mix with pop syrup in fast food restaurants. Minus the lemon flavor, it would be the same. After tasting it, they all went down the drain. I thought I was getting some thing I could drink...
1,TORNADO ENERGY Active, 16 Ounce (Pack of 24)		This energy drink sure does have an active taste. My eyes immediately crossed on the first sip. Very sour/bitter but I trudged on for you the home viewer. Whoa. I guess someone thought that energy drinks have to taste bad to be good. They succeeded on this one. This is not my cup of tea, well tea with way too much tartness. I honestly cant down enough to see if an energy surge kicks in. If you like really tart/sour/bitter drinks this is for you and I expect with enough ingested, you're gonna have a boost.
1,Very STALE. I EXPECTED THEM TO BE SOFT WITH THE TEXTURE AND FLAVOR OF THE STICKS BUT THEY DEFINITELY DID NOT
1,does not taste like stuff from regular store. hard to determine exact amount for flavor. Not like kool aide. No measuring like detergent box.
1,This is disgusting. This stuff tastes like someone got drunk and puked into a can, now Campbell's is trying to sell it.
1,no  me  gusto.
1,When I ordered this item I was sent the Special K Protein Meal Bars, rather than Snack bars.  I reported this to Amazon, and they told me that they would ship the correct item.  However, the new package again contained only Meal Bars.  The description/title of this item must be incorrect.  Do not order this item if you are looking for the Snack Bars.
1,I expected these to be crunchy waffle cookies with a light, sweet filling.  Instead, the waffle cookie was very soft and extremely chewy.  It really didn't have much of a taste.  The closest I can think of is it tasted like sugar-free strawberry jelly/jam.  No one in my family likes these.
1,nasty
1,these were bitter and had some kind of funk.  i tried to eat them in a salad, and nearly puked.  so i tried cooking them. same poison taste.  they went in the worm bin.  hope they don't kill them.  just horrible.
1,in my struggle to bake with less carbs, these mixes upset my stomach and I've not returned to them after my first disasterous attempts.  The sugar free cakes look like regular cakes when baked, and they taste good and go down well, but I found they cause me gastric distress.  What I do now is buy regular cake mix, and add fiber to it, in the form of almond flour and corn bran (also oat bran is high fiber, I buy my bran products from Honeyville).  I add the required oil and eggs and use about 1/2 or sometimes a third of the box mix (because I usually make one layer at a time), and add the fiber I want approximately 1/4 c almond meal and about 1/4 c corn bran, and the cake raises just as if I'd made no alterations to the dry ingredients, and it tastes fine.  If I'm using a chocolate cake mix, I also add extra cocoa powder as I like a very chocolatey cake.  Buy cake mixes when they're on sale and experiment.  To make the cake sweeter, after I've added the almond flour, corn bran and chocolate, I add abit of no calorie, no carb Stevia.  As the mix uses sugar, you won't be able to taste the Stevia (or whichever sugar substitute you like).  If you're a low carber, pre-diabetic or diabetic, you should still be able to enjoy a small piece of cake now and again (check with your health provider).  This works much better for me than the sugar free cake mixes, and causes me no stomach distress.  I never even got to the sugar free icings after what the sugar free cake mixes put me through.		Update 10/19/13 - Using a regular cake mix, I've come up with a reduced carb recipe I can eat without gastric distress.		1/3 of vanilla cake mix (save rest of mix for another recipe)	75 grams carbquik (a low carb flour substitute sold here or on netrition dot com)	50 grams almond flour (I like Honeyville but Trader Joes works just as well)	7 grams of Stevia (Costco dot com)	1/2 teaspoon baking powder	1 teaspoon vanilla extract (more if you prefer)	1/2 teaspoon almond extract	pinch of salt		add eggs, fat and liquids as per back of cake mix package.  the substitutes give a single layer cake that rises and tastes like a traditional cake, but with significantly fewer carbs, as carbquik has just 6 net carbs per cup (as opposed to 80 carbs in many flours), and almond flour has significantly fewer carbs as well, and stevia has no carbs. The sugar in the cake mix covers the aftertaste that I can usually detect with stevia. Also the flour substitute carbquik has a faint aftertaste, which the flour and sugar in the cake mix, plus the good tasting almond flour, covers up.  Making the substitutions, I get a cake that tastes and has a very similar texture to a traditionally made cake, with a much lower carb hit and no stomach distress.	Enjoy!
1,I first bought another brand of coconut butter and found it to my liking in every way. Hoping that all brands will not be so different from each other, I tried Kevala, and was disappointed to find its texture too coarse and dry, as if dried juiced out coconut meat was processed by blender. It does not have the silkiness and softness of coconut flesh as in the other brand. So much for trying another brand; I will stick to the first one I bought.
1,very disappointed. i ordered two and they were both moldy before we could use the starter! literally greenish black in color.
1,Gross don't buy
1,This bottle was not potent as the last one I ordered.  And it doesn't taste as good.  I have stored it properly. I have no idea how to contact the seller directly.
1,I love my Donut Shop coffee and I thought these were the same "line" of coffee flavors for the Keurig.  It smelled really good when it was brewing but when you taste it the flavor just takes fake and not like what you would expect.  Very nasty, haven't drunk anymore.  Waste of my money.
1,I am not a tea expert by any means, but I drink a lot of hot teas (black, green, white, spiced, herbal, etc.) and I know what I like.  Unfortunately, I just do not like this tea.  I agree with the reviewer who said it had a sharp peppery finish, but that is about the only taste it has.  The smell of the tea reminds me of black licorice and fresh mowed grass - a nauseating combination for me, not pleasant.  Since this tea has garnered so many great reviews, maybe it is just my taster.  Also, I have never tasted any other Darjeeling teas other than this one by Twinnings to compare, so maybe I just don't like Darjeeling tea.  However, I love all the other Twinnings' teas and drink them daily (except for Oolong, but that is a different review).
1,Tasted like dried potpourri.
1,so bad hate very one I warm up
1,Stale, stale, stale.  Amazon picked up the tab.
1,These arrived in one solid block. I hate to think how the supplier achieved that effect!
1,This is the worst smelling and tasting food additive that i have ever come across. The chemical smell and taste is so overwhelmingly horrible! IT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE LEMON. I bought this based on positive reviews (2 bottles in fact) and i had to run it down the drain. If i could this product -10, i would.
1,I was actually a little disappointed with this product. I'm a fan of Orville Redenbacker products, but the caramel was just too artificially flavored for me.  I know most stuff isn't real caramel these days, but this came in behind a couple others.  I'd rather pay more, for better caramel flavor.
1,My family is vegan and we are experimenting with a variety of products that we can eat on the run. Unfortunately, this product will not be in the lineup for us. We gave it a fair shake, too-all 6 of us tried it. The flavor is bland, and the texture is odd. The family's texture description ranged from dried cat puke to pillow filling. Not for us.
1,I wanted to love this, but no such luck! I much prefer making my own mayo in small batches.
1,The taste is very mild and is overwhelmed by vinegar. You will get the same results with plain vinegar and if you want to get fancy put pepper and onion powder. A significant disappointment due to lack of distinct taste.
1,Too hot for my tastes.. I was looking for something a bit sweeter and less hot.
1,I would consider this very herbal rather than spice. The rose hips are a bit strong to my liking.	I would also prefer a stronger cinnamon and orange spice flavor. I added a little bit of liquid stevia and it helps a tad, but the aroma of the rose hips is so strong that overwhelms the rest	I will try to add more next time but I have a feeling it is just going to increase the rose hips flavor.		I would consider this a swing and a miss.		*Update* I am now considering it a total failure. I even picked out many of the rose hips and it still doesn't have what I would consider a Herbal Orange Spice flavor
1,Flavor is terrible
1,The bars that arrived were stale! Thought I would break my tooth biting into these!
1,I bought these packages thinking that the cheese sauce would taste great but it really does not.  The powdered sauce that you add after boiling the little pasta rings is weak, artificial tasting  and not very enjoyable.  I was really disappointed in the flavor.  I even added butter after a few bites to try to fix it......it did not help.  I still have 7 boxes left so that shows how uninterested I am in eating this bland food.  It would have been much more ecconomical to just buy a box of pasta and buy regular cheese to add to it.  There is nothing wrong with this product except it's fairly dull tasting and expensive for what you get.  I will not be buying this product again.
1,I bought this vanilla because I read the reviews but when they arrived I thought the bad odour was due to the packaging, so, I put a pod in the sugar and bad odour persists ..... Never again!
1,Did not help stomach made stomach worst
1,The coffee is good testing but the Keurig cups for this brand or batchare terrible. I get coffee grinds in my cup (on two different brewers) regularly and the brewers clog as well. Never had this problem with any other brand. Stay away.
1,These are put simply, bad. I struggled to finish the first one. Never really been a fan of Cadbury, mostly because I don't try their chocolates. I don't particularly like Hersheys chocolate, I find it synthetic tasting, but it's the only comparison I can think of for Cadbury. I have had their easter eggs and I have to say, as much as I detest their eggs, the chocolate on those actually tastes far superior to these "fingers". The biscuit tastes stale and the chocolate is more like sugary wax, no chocolate flavor that I can detect. It was only $2.79 at the store for one box but I wish I could get that money back because I can't stand to eat another biscuit.
1,I have ordered this truffle salt but different brands many times from Amazon.  Not at all happy with this one.  Within weeks the salt became soft and clumpy.  Worse Truffle salt I have every ordered...and now have to throw away the entire purchase.  Waste of time.  You can see from my past orders I consistently am ordering Truffle products.  Bad Bad Bad!
1,There's a weird taste like there are additives or other non-coffee debris ground in to the coffee.  I switched to a different brand (Kicking Horse whole bean).
1,Independent lab tests have confirmed that this product contains significant levels of heavy metals.  Garden of Life has NOT refuted these results as of date.  GOL has instead attacked the website that published the results.  In the past I purchased numerous products from this company, which I feel are grossly overpriced, because I wanted the peace of mind of knowing I am getting top quality, clean products.  Instead I am emptying my wallet for the exact opposite.  These latest findings make me question the integrity of all GOL products.  Seldom does one cut corners in one area.	 It is important to note that Jordan Rubin left the company and is no longer involved with procuring ingredients.  Apparently the new owners are more concerned about taking your money than putting out a reputable product.  As far as I'm concerned, this company is dead to me and I will not purchase any of their products anymore. I encourage everyone to do the same to protect their health as well as punish this company for its egregious behavior.
1,too sweet
1,It was great, but the last 2 containers of it surprised me with mold hiding in the middle.  They were sealed and not expired, but moldy nonetheless.
1,I just made my first cup of the French toast decaf. It doesn't taste rich enough to be a French roast, and the flavor is off. I love Green Mountain Dark Magic, and was looking for a cheaper option. You get what you pay for (or less). This is around 1/2 the price, but not even 1/2 as good. If you like a dark, rich brew, DO NOT buy this!
1,nuts to large.
1,No flavor and not ripened
1,cheap green tea
1,I wasn't paying attention and paid .50 each when the label has a retail price of .25!		I'm not blaming Amazon because it was a fulfillment through warehouse, I'm blaming myself so don't make the same mistake some of us have made
1,I love Trader Joe's products 95% of the time, but they have some doozies, and this is one of them. Really acidic, bitter, and astringent. Only potable with tremendous dilution and creamer. If you are addicted enough to caffeine to force this down, do yourself a favor and get some caffeine pills instead.
1,Weird chemical taste - cannot recommend!
1,I think these are an acquired taste. They were disgusting and even my wife spit it out and she loved dried fruits. I would not recommend dried melon. But please note, Sincerely Nuts makes some of the best products I have found. It is just this one so far that fails.
1,Too strong and bitter for me.
1,This was shipped to me damaged. The dropper top had been cut and appeared to have dry rotted some. It may be the exposure to air in the package ruined what was in the bottle. It has a very vanilla taste but the aftertaste in my coffee is kinda strong. It ruined it for me. Not a good pack job and a little dissappointed
1,I like the cheesy jalapeno ones but I'm reviewing the butter flavor here and the butter is just too salty to enjoy. I would not buy the butter flavor again.
1,Their Golden is golden but not a fan of this version.  Just too burnt bitter a taste for me.  If your buds leans toward the grilled flavors then you might like this however.
1,I bought this huge size because I do the Paleo diet and love this, and figured it would save me so much money over buying the individual bottles. I took very good care of the large bottle- refrigerating it, not leaving the lid off, etc. Sadly, 3/4 of the bottle got moldy and I have to throw everything away (like throwing a $50 bill in the trash :( ). Would you be able to send me a new one? I bought the product via Amazon and can send you any proof you need.
1,It doesn't have enough coconut oil flavor.  I don't know if is discolored.  Although price is really nice, I'd rather pay more for the rich coconut flavor.
1,I tried a box of this at my local Walmart out of curiosity and cheapness---it's about a buck cheaper than a box of Twining's mint tea which I usually buy.		BIG mistake!  Whereas a single Twining's teabag in my 40oz teapot is enough to produce a wonderfully vivid, fresh taste, I had to use THREE of these Bigelow teabags in order to come close to it, and it still wasn't quite as pleasing.  It's hard to describe exactly, but this Bigelow's tea has a very flat, lifeless and sort of synthetic taste.		So, this is not only a case of "you get what you pay for," but also a lesson in false economy: one box of Twinings gives me TWENTY 40oz teapots, while the Bigelow's would only yield 6.3 almost-as-good teapots.
1,This did not taste good to me.  To me, it tasted flat and uninspiring.  It was not worth the price especially when the shipping was added.
1,We have been buying this brand ever since we've had a Keurig, more than four years.  No more.  The coffee has become completely unpredictable, even within the same box.  One cup will be as we remember it.  The next will be bitter.  The one after that will be too weak.  Apparently quality control has gone to the dogs.  We're looking for some other brand and look forward to this box of Newman's being gone.
1,I do not like the taste of these.
1,Was not a fan. Didn't taste very good and was over priced.
1,The price was cheap.  I wanted the convenience of a single serving packet.  The first case that I bought all were fine even after taking nine days for the box to be delivered.  UPDATE: I bought a second case of these 200 honey packets on November 21, 2014.  The product expiration date is January 15, 2015, less than two months away.  Several of them were leaking, so many of the packets were sticky.  ANOTHER UPDATE: I was foolish enough to buy another case of these 9-Gram Kraft honey packets.  The expiration date is seven weeks from my purchase date and several packets were leaking making a sticky mess of the other remaining ones.
1,Not very good I guess more of a. Chalky dark chocolate flavor and I was king of expecting milk chocolate
1,the cakes had green posts on them.  the expiration date on the box was 9/17/2013 and it was received 10/01/2013
1,i got these to send off as part of a christmas goodies box.  I decided to try a cup just to make sure they were my idea of pumpkin spice, as i have tried lattes locally and liked whatever brands they used.  So, i had high expectations.  Well, it just didn't fly. I would say green mountain's idea of pumpkin spice wouldnt even make a good pumpkin pie. it just needs something. i added powdered cinnamon and that helped a bit, but frankly the coffee had a bitter undertone. maybe too much clove or something. don't know.  i tossed the whole box as after 2 cups and experimenting with various spice additions, i knew my friends would just not like the stuff.  This one is a big miss on green mountain's part.
1,Terrible taste.
1,I bought it as an extra birthday gift because my girl loves Numi tea, we had some during her birthday dinner and she was excited to get the tea box.  Her excited went to disappointment.  There's 2 tea bags and 3 flower bulbs.  3 days of tea if that. I'm not sure what I paid for.
1,Not a fan. It just didn't stand out. This coffee isn't great, just like the TV show. It was quite mild for a fan of bold coffees. It was "meh".		On another note, the title of this one ("Take it Sleazy") makes this inappropriate for the workplace (ironically).
1,Gross! Not a very good taste at all! Artificial flavors, colors. Garbage candy!
1,I have the large bottle of the ghost pepper flavored Yellowbird sauce and it's real good. However, this sampler pack tasted like fish or some sort of soap. All three had the same "something weird" going on with it. It was so bad I had to throw them away. I had tried on three separate occasions to give them a chance along with a co-worker and we both agreed on the disposal. I may try them again at some point in the future but it won't be anytime soon.
1,I love regular BAI5 but this sparkling version is terrible. The flavors are so bad no one would drink them - any of them. Will not purchase it again.
1,I like almonds and almond milk.  I don't get a hint of almonds in these lightweight snacks.  I suppose they are healthier than other alternatives but the only time I open the box is when I'm compelled towards mindless munching.
1,I use to buy this product all the time because it was tasty and included everything needed for a complete meal but then I noticed that it and all it's counter parts NOW contain  MSG (monosodium glutamate).  Why would I or anyone with any intelligence want to deliberately eat a product with a brain destroying additive?  It's too bad because I really use to love the flavor and consistancy of this chicken alfredo.  They did not need to include MSG since it had lots of flavor in the original recipe but now....they've ruined it.
1,it is Not original (((( Guittard )))))  But (((((( E Guittard )))))) BE AWARE...BE AWARE...its not original...its Fake...there is No Authentic Mark of Guittard company on the bags ... every time we eat it rash all over our bodies appears, also if you try to combine it with nuts to make healthy bars it separates into fat and thick precipitant ...i tried to melt it in the melting pot to make strawberry covered chocolate it didn't give me chocolate but it coagulated n ended up with a thick dough...they use the worst cheapest coco powder and bad quality of fat .be careful ((even)) if you don't have allergy you will certainly have in a way or another rash or notice your breath because this kind of coco causes rash Note :we don't have any kind of allergy but we noticed every time we use it something happens..
1,Really weak tasting. Will not buy again.
1,Very disappointing! I thought there would be a little bit of flavor. Save and use the tap water.
1,Like eating a jellyfish.  Very gross.  I prepared it according to the directions.  I made it in an asian stir fry with a very strong sauce.  The taste was fine, but it was such a weird texture I couldn't get over it.  When you chew they don't chew up, you just swallow smaller pieces.  It feels like you're eating a rubber jellyfish.
1,Wish I would have tasted it before adding it to an egg salad that it pretty much rendered inedible.  Smelled like normal  mayo, but really did not taste like it, and SOOOO salty.  Funky flavor.  Can't believe I spent this much money on mayonaise I will probably throw out.
1,I have tried several coconut waters and they usually have no taste.  This one has a lot of taste.  Unfortunately all bad.
1,I suppose that I can mostly blame myself for not doing substantial *homework* on Dagoba. Sure, they are organic (nice), but they are Hershey !! Never again !!
1,These seeds do NOT have a bacon flavor. They taste like beef ramen noodle powder. They aren't bad but they don't taste like bacon. I do love the re sealable bag. I probably won't buy this flavor again but I will finish the bag. Disappointed. :(
1,These gummy bears do not have good flavor and are rather hard.  We were so disappointed.  The taste was very displeasing, nothing like their hard candies.  We were extremely disappointed.  We thought we could give these to our friends children when they come to visit but even the kids did not like them.  Surprisingly disappointing.
1,Not big on the fish smell, I read that it comes from the type of bacteria present during the long aging cycle.  I have had other Pu-erh and it had no where near the strengh of this brand.
1,Rice noodles are delicious and the macaroni in these microwavable cups is of good quality.		Unfortunately, the powdered "cheese" sauce is runny, salty, doesn't taste like cheese, and has a slight unpleasant aftertaste.  It reminds me of when times were rough in the 1970s and people bought the black and white boxes of generic macaroni and cheese at five for a dollar and then made it with water only and no butter or milk.		Preparation is easy IF you are able to figure out that the fill line for the water is lower than expected and isn't printed with ink, just incised in the paper.  I found that using less water and giving it a couple of stirs during cooking gave a better result and that it needed black pepper to be edible.  Still, it wasn't very good.		The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/brown-rice-version/dp/B004TPUT9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">brown rice version</a>&nbsp;has a few grams of fiber and tastes a bit better, too.
1,Oh am I absolutely heartbroken that these are so terrible.  I thought from the reviews - so many, that these would be different than all the other natural, allergy free, gluten free, wheat free blah blah blah that I've tried.  When there's one or two 5 star/4 star on this kind of product I don't order it because I chalk it up to either people who never enjoyed "fully loaded food" but have always been limited in diet and so in comparison to the other choices, they probably are good - or people like some I know who really don't care about taste, as long as it says the right thing on the package, they think it's great.  Me, I've been modifying my diet relatively recently (a few years) due to severe allergies that literally make me feel like I might not recover from the reaction to some foods I have always eaten.  Everything I eat since this started is like a cross your fingers and hope it's ok, pray while I suffer through a reaction and be thrilled when it's over, or add to the list of food I can still eat and do the "I can eat it " dance. Certain preservatives are a huge culprit but so are other things so it's always a test.  I thought maybe I found one of those nothing bad in it foods that I could tolerate and would taste good.  These are terrible -I won't know until tomorrow if I can  tolerate them but it doesn't matter, I didn't even want to finish the first cookie.  They deserve a star for being soft-that's rare in low allergen foods.  But they don't taste anything like a snickerdoodle, they taste like a day old bran muffin with cinnamon on top and you can absolutely tell that they are "nothing in it" food - if not while eating it (which is obvious to me) the after taste is an absolute giveaway, just like all the rest.  The only decent thing beyond soft is a little cinnamon taste but that can't overcome the non-sweet sweeteners that curse all allergy free products in my opinion and nothing can help the grainy texture.  I'm truly heartbroken. I want a DECENT sweet that is safe! These are so grainy, cakelike but dry - not like a glass of milk could cure it dry - just grainy dry - must be the flaxseed. It's better than some products I've tried but not edible-at least not as long as I can eat other foods.  My experience with allergy free food has not been the greatest so I try everything I can and some foods that are not free of everything are tolerated while some foods that are everything free can still give me a reaction, just less likely so I'd rather have low risk experimental food-it's just such a bummer when they aren't any good.  I envy all of you who can enjoy them, I wish I could but the taste, the aftertaste and the texture are three strikes and just too much for me.
1,I was very excited to find this and have purchased Hoosier Hill Farm products in the past without issue. Unfortunately, I am unable to endorse this product. It arrived today in the mail and I thought I'd try some in a cup of coffee. I showed it to my husband who thought it would be good to use in his coffee too. I read the label as the coffee was brewing and [insert record scratching] I saw listed as ingredients "refinery syrup, honey". Huh? What the heck is refinery syrup?! I thought that I purchased granulated HONEY. Wrong. After researching "refinery syrup" on the internet I saw that I paid a lot for granulated sucrose syrup (byproduct of the refining of cane sugar). I never opened the product so I can't comment on its taste. I am so disappointed and sending this back. Please don't let this review discourage you from their other products. They do have some great products (and well packaged) but this one is not for me. Hoosier please put in your description that this is not 100% honey.
1,What Happened?!! I was an avid user of this brand of raw honey but my most recent order came in the mail and it was as hard as a brick! The last couple times I have order this it had a smoother/creamier honey texture but this time its almost impossible to get out of the container. It seriously looks like they just sent me a jar of beeswax...I checked the expiration date and it said good until 2018 but in this hardened state its pretty much unusable, it seriously takes all my strength to get the tiniest bit of honey out. I'm not sure what Y.S. Eco Bee Farms changed in their honey making process but please go back to the old formula that was as solid as a rock. I'm very dissapointed and it saddens me that I have to find a new raw honey brand as I will no longer be ordering this one :(
1,No natural sweetness. San Marzano are much better.
1,The label says it's peanut butter. The ingredient list states there re peanuts in here. But I swear, if the first time you tried this was in a blind taste test you would not know this was any sort of peanut butter. There are so many other flavors going on that it no longer resembles peanut butter. The taste is good in small quantities but I couldn't imagine eating a whole PB&J sandwich or anything like that with this stuff. I wouldn't buy it again and I can't recommend it.
1,I've been really happy with all the other Kind bars I've tried, but these were really bland comparatively. It also didn't help that the package I received had been too hot at some point--the bars were all malted and sticky. This hasn't been an issue with any others.
1,Not great, must use more than stated. I use it in Ice Tea. Strange after taste.
1,No, would not purchase again.
1,Taste is okay not impressed
1,Didn't like it, BUT, if the manufacturer is listening, it could be saved.  Go with low fat/low sodium cheese, make the bar slightly bigger and you might even market it as a health food to the vegetarian market.  As is, the best use would be to dump it in a soup for taste.
1,Absolutely lied about contents-there is no banana and this list of what it does NOT contain can go one forever! Such as tangerine:( why lie??
1,Agree with the stone in the salt review. I have been wondering why in my baked goods I keep nearly cracking a tooth on something hard and gritty. When you bite down on one of these pieces anyone in the vicinity looks at you with concern for your teeth. Now I have an entire bag of expensive salt that can only be used to clean, bummer.
1,Not exactly a nutritious snack but then again, I shouldn't have ordered them.  ; P
1,I love their Cherry product.  I've had better grape jelly from store bought.  Not deep enough grape flavor.
1,Gave one to several friends and acquainteses to see if any wanted the rest of my order, but none did.  The veg's & mango flavors are too dominant.
1,Comparing this to Starbucks Green Tea Latte. Not even close. Can't even taste the Green tea, just watered down, green looking, sugar water.
1,More sugar than flavor, but ok. Wish there was more flavor.
1,The Snappy white popcorn is better than the Orville Redenbacher product. I popped both exactly the same way using Snappy coconut oil and the Orville's was chewier and heavier. It almost tastes stale despite being within date. I won't buy this again as long as Snappy white popcorn is available on Amazon.
1,Poor pkging! The lid cracked when I opened it. Tastes yuk too! You could taste the plastic!
1,While it takes some additional veg, and maybe chicken, to really make a meal, it's ok.  I really like the idea that the consumer can decide the quantity of flavoring to add.  However, the box I got contained not only the product, but cockroaches.  Guess it's inevitable, but this is almost as bad as bedbugs.......and that is the reason for the 2 stars.
1,I don,t like this at all it taste like dish water no matter how much you us to brew it. I thought it was like the Teeccino product I use but it is not even close I will stick with my other product that has great taste and has a coffee flavor.
1,The sugar free part tasted okay and the "adverse reaction" set in. DO NOT EAT MORE THAN TWO!!!
1,Very strong taste, I didn't care for the taste..
1,Does not fit my coffee maker.
1,It is o.k., but not especially good. The chocolate does not have much taste, nor are the raspberries very noticeable.
1,Glad this was so cheap as it is gonna end up in the compost pile.		When I opened the jar I was expecting the usual mind reeling hit of Hing - all I got was a lightweight HINT of garlic and turmeric.  DON'T BUY THIS if you have ever had the real stuff.  DON'T EVEN TRY THIS if you want to find out what Hing really tastes like when cooked.  It's wonderful.  If you like garlic - use real garlic.		I tried to read the ingredient list shown in the image online before I purchased this, but even with a magnifying glass could not see what was in it so took a chance.		Should have known that this was SIGNIFICANTLY LACKING HING when the 'recipe' provided said to use a TEASPOON of the stuff.  Hmmmmm.  If you use a teaspoon of real Hing for the amount of dal suggested in the recipe, your head might blow up.  Oh, well - Foiled again.		Had to give it a star because that's the way the program works.  Doesn't even deserve that.
1,I ordered two 24 can packs of 11.5 oz. V-8 juice, which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer. When i opened the box, although all the flip-tabs appeared to be intact, one can had leaked some of it's contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box. I weighed the cans to find out which one/s had leaked and that's how i determined which one to throw away.(the weight of the cans varied, but the variance was consistent, except one can was a few ounces short)  I am hoping it was just from the one can and i don't turn up with salmonella down the road. Since this was a UPS delivery, i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package. Usually get superior service from them. I have ordered like this in the past, and the product arrived in perfect condition, so as i said, i was disappointed this time.
1,I drink mostly decaf, but when it comes to Tassimo the options are limited and extremely poor.  I was excited to see this new decaf being offered, and rushed to order it.		Unfortunately, it's just as bad as the others.  It's way too watered down.  I stop it early to make it slightly better but I won't be buying this again.  They really need a double T-disc decaf to make a bold cup.		Have to say, sadly, pass on this one.
1,One only needs to look at the ingrediants to know why America has health problems. Made with all natural High Fructose death syrup. America eats so much corn in everything we eat, which is coicidentually how we fatten out cows and pigs so we can eat them faster. YO DOG we heard you like diabetes so we put diabetes in your diabetes so you can get diabetes while you got diabetes.
1,Not what you would think lots of hard candy but little tiny pc or gum. Will definitely be giving away and will not purchase again.
1,I am a vegetarian, health food buyer for many years. This product is not fresh. Definitely stale. I purchased for my classroom and have given them the same product before with no problem. When purchasing from the product this time the taste is not fresh at all! Extremely upset about the quality of this product when purchased this time. I do not have money to waste and I know many others reading this do not have money to waste. Do not buy it,,
1,Not like the old Snaps.
1,I don't know; normally I like bran cereals but not this one. Too much of a crunch, and tastes like bland dirt (not that I eat much dirt as a rule, but I'm guessing from the smell).
1,I purchased the BLACK food coloring and was looking for reviews on only this color. Most of the reviews are about RED. Shouldn't be here for this product. Will come back to rate product when I get it.
1,Its probably just me, but I didn't like this at all.
1,Didn't care for it.
1,Product is very oily, I had to drain a bunch off to eat it.  The flavor is ok, pretty sweet, but the texture is very grainy and there are numerous small lumps of sugar in it.  I don't know if it's suppose to be that way, if it's the brown sugar that is used in it or what, but I didn't care for it. It made it kind of crunchy, and not in a good way.
1,Gross. Very bitter. A shocking amount of robusta beans used in this mix. I'm very disappointed that I didn't catch that. I read all the great reviews but I am unimpressed. I know that Lavazza is a very popular company but this purchase left a bad taste in my mouth (in more ways than one). Will NOT be buying again and am prob not going to be trying this brand again.
1,So-so, but at least better than the apple version.
1,This is let down flavor, too much mints, very little chocolate. Regret buying this, stuff like that should stick with grocery..
1,I'm a little unimpressed with the mojo bars. I like most clif products universally. These don't have any particularly compelling taste, they're not as durable as a standard clif bar for backpacking, and they're not as addictive as Z bars or luna bars.		Still love clif, but if they discontinued this line I'd be indifferent.
1,These are a great value, but are dried out and have zero taste.
1,Bland and fatty, especially noticeable when served cold.  Not a fan.
1,Disappointed with the flavors.
1,I have a gum addiction and this is the worst tasting gum I have ever had.  I am all for the all natural gum or at least something without aspartame, but this is not the answer. I believed some of the other reviewers and went ahead and tried it. After trying every single flavor, I threw them all out. I am not one to waste this much money, but it wasn't worth trying to chew anymore of it. If you're looking for an alternative to aspartame gum, I would recommend Pur gum. It tastes great, thought doesn't last too long (except the cinnamon).
1,The taste of this coffee seemed ok at first when I added creamer. Well then, when I didn't look forward to my morning coffee anymore, knew this wasn't right! It is bland and does not taste fresh!
1,This was a 2 pack of hot sauce and expires in 3 months! I checked all other sauces that are already in my pantry and they expire 2016 or 2017 so Im guessing this has been sitting on a shelf somewhere for the last year. Besides I'd never be able to use 2 bottles of jalapeno hot sauce within 3 months.  Next time I'll buy it local where I can check the expiration date!
1,It says grilling blend but it really isn't good for grilling AT ALL! Most onions and pepper pieces were way too small to be skewered and the rest was a wet soggy mess by the time it was ready to grill. They turned out mushy.  I would use it for stir fry or other dishes but grilling? No!
1,My family did not like this popcorn and neither did I.  It had a funny taste, and no cheese flavor could be detected.
1,Came melted
1,This candy bar is semi bitter with scant chocolate taste.  Way too much money just bc it's made with Stevia. It tastes dry and artificial.
1,WAY too sweet!  1% added sugar???  I guess they felt they had to appeal to the generic "American" tastes, but there is no reason in the world that coconut water needs added sugar.  My mouth feels like I drank a can of Classic Coke after drinking this... sticky and like I need water to wash it down - not at all refreshing like true coconut water (packaged or natural).  I wish I had read the fine print when before I bought this but I thought "PURE coconut water" meant just that... not a sugar-sweetened kool-aid version of what is perfect in its natural state.  I will NOT be purchasing  this product again.
1,I have always enjoyed salt water taffy and a couple of these flavors were alright. But for the most part, this is the WORST I have ever tasted. Maybe, I should have read the reviews before purchasing it. But I don't ever remember a taffy that was so nasty. There was a yellowish brown, buttery flavored one, that was just awful. Maybe, the other ones were right, in that it needed an expiration date, they were a little hard too.	The only reason I kept eating them is that I they were the only thing I had at my doctor's office and I had gotten hungry. Other than that, I would have just thrown them away. I want to make sure I express how horrible they were. So if any one will read reviews, they will not waste their money. It will be a while before I get that taste out of my mouth.
1,I was so disappointed I love Guy Fieri but this coffee sucks!! It's bitter and has a weak banana fosters flavor. Sorry Guy, take a tip from Smart Sips brand.
1,dont like it
1,Pure salt...
1,Taste like salt water. I couldn't finish a box. Nasty tasty. Stick to Goya cOconto water
1,I purchased these tamales to use in taco/tamale salads. I was disappointed that they were rather bland. I normally don't care for highly spiced food but would have preferred more spice. I like Nalley products and my favorite chili is Nalley so I was surprised that I didn't enjoy these tamales more than I did.
1,I love KIND bars and signed up for the "subscribe & save" with these.  When I received my first delivery, the bars tasted very stale, but I didn't cancel my subscription because I thought that maybe I just got a bad box.  Now having received a few boxes, I am cancelling my subscription because they've all been stale-tasting. If they were fresher like the ones I buy from the grocery store, I would have given them 5 stars.
1,broken when received
1,yuck..flavorless and watered down tasting, I won't buy this again
1,I bought 2 of them. one seemed to be good,  the other was garbage,  fake and did not even have coffee smell or taste., no flavor.  II will not buy again here.
1,I read the reviews and took a chance that this product did not contain Carrageenan.  There were several comments that it does not, even though it was listed.  In my search I put "Carrageenan-free'.  A whole lot of good that did me.  I received the box today and THE BLOODY STUFF CONTAINS CARRAGEENAN!  Why on Earth make something Organic and then go muck it up with crap like that?  Sort of defeats the purpose, right?  People who want to eat healthy buy organic.  Pacific is either in the business of providing healthy food items, or they are not.  This is NOT healthy.  Foul ingredients sort of sully (damage the purity or integrity of; defile) the idea of Organic.
1,let me start by saying, I tried this brand 100% because of reviews on amazon......		Their hot is pretty darn good for hot.	The Med. is average... don't see a med. spice... I have had many brands better than this..		Tried the med. because the hot is pretty hot, but Id give 4.5 / 5 for the hot, 3/5 for the med..
1,Just tried Healthy Choice Lunch Express Sweet and Sour "asian style sauce with chicken, peppers, and pineapple & rice" and recently tried their Italian Style Penne.		Both of these meals were on clearance for a buck at a local supermarket, so I figured I'd give them a try.		I think that the sweet and sour is on the better side of lousy.  It's certainly edible.  If I was on a camping trip and could figure out how to make this with boiling water, it might not be a bad option.  But truly, the taste is something just south of mediocre.  There's not much "chicken" and what chicken there is seems to be tiny cubes of processed-looking dark meat chicken.  The sauce is ok, but not what I'd call tasty.		The Italian Style Penne is slightly better.  Let's call that one 3 stars, being fully mediocre in my view.  Penne pasta is yet another mediocre-tasting sauce.		I suppose these dinners are barely acceptable for someone who needs meals that don't require refrigeration prior to preparation.  I don't care for them and don't recommend them.  Not sure why there are so many high ratings, but to each their own.		2 stars for the "Sweet and Sour" and 3 stars for the Italian-style Penne".  Not recommended unless you simply must have food that does not require refrigeration.
1,Didn't like these at all. I remember having them about a decade ago and they were really great. Now they are just a gooey sticky mess. The texture is like carmel, which I don't like (they were crunchy before just like the photo shown,  with a creamy coating - now they are chewy). They also came all melted and rolled up into balls.
1,I was looking forward to this lycorice candy. Unfortunately they are not only licorice. They also contain ANISE and they taste much more of anise than of licorice. Called Amazon for a refund based on the fact that nowhere does it say the product contains anise. If I had known, I wouldn't have ordered. Fortunately, Amazon has the BEST refund and return policy in the world.
1,I've purchased these mints before, the problem is this item is listed as a 6 pack, however, it is indeed a 1 pack of mints.  The mints however a big, strong, and last for some time as long as you don't chew them.
1,Perhaps it's because my palate is primitive, but I'm of the opinion the cost to taste ratio for this coffee is a bit much.		I placed the beans in my burr grinder, set the grind for French press and then brewed the coffee.  It wasn't bad coffee, but it certainly wasn't spectacular coffee either.		I next brewed the coffee in a drip coffee maker.  I set my grinder for the appropriate grind and then, after brewing, I tasted the end result.  Still not impressed.		For the amount of money I paid for this coffee bean, if I wasn't ecstatic at its distinctive flavor (even with a palate as untrained as mine), I'd expect a few of the beans to jump out of my grinders storage bin and slap me silly up side my head at my very audacity of daring to impune their celebrated nature.  But they didn't move.  At all.  Not one bean.		Will I buy Royal Kona coffee (or ANY Kona coffee) again?  Oh puh-leeze .....
1,In my view, lemon drops should be both sweet and tart. These are slightly sweeter than I prefer. Worse, to precent them from sticking together, they are dredged in powdered sugar, and it's not possible to shake it all off. Therefore, the first taste is of pure sweetness with no lemon at all. Hence, the tartness is almost completely lost in all the sweetness. I will not be buying these again.
1,I know I cant do a return due to flavor, but if I could, I would. It tastes gross and chemical/artificial. I don't know if its the entire Healthy Request like or just this one. Progresso is better.
1,Purchased this because it was recommended to help with chronic headaches.  WAY too spicy.  I couldn't get past the first sip.  If you don't like powerful spicy hot ginger, stay away. But if you do enjoy that taste experience, this may be the product for you.
1,this item is hit or miss.  Sometimes we get a beautiful large pice of broccolli;  other times several small scrawny brocs with not that many bulbs
1,hate this gum, hard and tasteless very quickly
1,Not what we expected from HARIBO gummy products. Fake tasting peach covered in course sugar. Trouble giving them away! LOL!!!
1,I love this drink and flavor but when I received my order 3 of the cans had exploded and soaked the box. I was very sad and disappointed
1,BEEF CASING ruins these, be aware.
1,This has a smoky taste that is so strong and awful tasting.  How anyone gave this a high rating is beyond me.  I only ate two bites and got a headache.	I only eat fat free or low fat dressings so it's not like I was trying a ff product for the first time. Truly horrible product.
1,These discs are more expensive as is every Starbuck product.  And I am	sure many people get these because they are starbuck's, but guess what	Gelvia or the other brands are just as good if not better, but coffee	is a matter of taste and if you love this taste, then you pay the price.	We will not order these again, but we tried them.  Again, you have to	have the correct coffee maker in order to use any of these particular	coffee discs.  Have Fun
1,Wow, what bride wants broken snacks at her wedding reception. These were packed so tightly that they are in crumbs.  :) This is why they are so cheap because you end up with CRUMBS!!  So now with my wedding a month away I have to reorder from another vendor and spend money AGAIN.  I should get a refund for all these crumbs!
1,Minimally adequate.  For a small coffee cup you need to use 3 of the K-cups.  Otherwise it is brown water.  So I use 3 on the small demitasse cup size, add some frothed half and half (made with the espresso maker) and combine.  Steam with the espresso maker and drink.  It's much easier and cheaper to make from scratch.  Won't be buying it again.
1,Just noticed this 'Chunky Roadhouse Beef and Bean Chili' has 1g of trans fat.  Definitely unhealthy, regardless of the great fiber and protein.
1,I absolutely do NOT recommend this brand of almond paste to any home baker. Every Christmas, I have dozens of fruit cakes to decorate - first, with a layer of almond paste and second, with fondant. Almond paste adds delicious flavor to the rum, fruits, brown sugar, etc. But, because fruit cake can be quite lumpy, the almond paste creates a smooth, level platform upon which to place the fondant which, in turn, is decorated with snowflakes or whatever I desire. SOLO almond paste comes out of the package dry. When rolled, it cracks and breaks apart. You must  constantly push the edges together and re-roll. Then it breaks apart again. When you try to place it on the cake, it cracks and breaks, particularly along the edges. So you have to patch it, losing any smoothness. If you add water (a common way to soften almond paste) it sweats. And no matter how much you knead and knead, some sort of icky liquid sweats out. This oozes through the fondant and creates a mess on the surface of the cake. There is another almond paste in a long tube (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to  mention the name) which is much, much better. Buy that. I also make my own almond paste. But because I have so many cakes to decorate, it isn't always convenient to do so and I must rely on commercial brands. I will never buy SOLO again and neither should you.
1,Just don't like the taste
1,Very deceptive marketing. Good organic basalmic vinegar but in a plastic bottle!!! No BPA. However #2 plastic leeches estrogenic chemicals disrupting hormonal balance and alters the structure of human cells. Who cares about being organic or having antioxidants if you bottle your product in toxic material.
1,They added almond flavoring to a hazelnut flavored creamer.  This threw-off my husband since he doesn't like almond flavoring.
1,Much too sweet !
1,I bought 2 of these bags, and I feel as if the tea quality is horrible. Usually for many herbs, the deeper the color, the stronger the purity. This product is like green, grey, and white. Drinking 3 to 4 glasses does absolutely nothing.
1,These were the most disappointed flowers I ever bought. They arrived late in the day on Tuesday and by Thursday noon, they were already drooping, dropping pedals and leaves. If I could give negative stars I would. I would have been better off buying flowers at the grocery store.
1,While  know the product is fantastic, I can't  say so much for the shipping.  The bag of flour was cracked open and spilled everywhere. Included in the box was a shower curtain that was not 100% sealed so it got a nice coating of flour too. Now, if it was something I was going to fry up it would have been perfectly coated, but since it was a shower curtain it became a pasty gooey mess when I tried to rinse the flour off. I added some pics AFTER I'd cleaned most of the flour out of the box. So, good luck if you take the chance on ordering!
1,i used to buy apple chips all the time and thought they would be a great treat for the kids, but i was wrong. there are STEMS & seeds in every bag so far, what a bad reminder of why i quit buying them years ago!! i love the flavor, but they really need to fix whatever the problem is (you'd think years would be long enough to learn people don't want to eat the core, stems, or seeds)
1,Very disappointing.  The nuts are not properly roasted to bring out their flavor.  I gave most of them to the birds and squirrels.		 I'd recommend you look elsewhere for god deluxe mixed nuts.  I'd suggest www.priesters.com.  Their "Supreme Mixed Nuts" is a mixture of cashews, almonds, pecans, and macadamia nuts, all jumbo, all perfectly roasted.  They're fabulous.  They're a bit on the expensive side, but no more than most.
1,Disappointed with the way they packed the box.  There wasn't any kind of cushion between the cans and the box.  I had dented cans and tomato sauce all over the inside of the box and on the other cans.		Not sure I'd order it again because at least 6 cans were ruined.
1,I love most of the Kashi bars.  My favorite is the dark mocha almond.  I decided I'd try something different, so I purchased these layered dark chocolate coconut ones.  Firstly, there is no chocolate flavor in the bar that I can detect.  So sad!  I love chocolate and really, you can't taste any in this bar.  Secondly, the frosting and/or topping of the bar tastes really weird.  Can't tell if it tastes like dates or what!  No coconut flavor can be had in this bar, either.  In fact, the entire bar doesn't really taste like much of anything.  A real disappointment.
1,I have been eating these since I was a kid and I'm 62. I was very disappointed with this product this time. It appears that they are putting 1/3 of the marshmallow in each cone then they used to. It's all cone. I wish they would have left it alone and raised the price instead.
1,I love the crackers but they were all broken upon arrival!
1,I'll try almost any kind of popcorn, and I like spicy food, but I wish I'd given this one a miss.  The cayenne dust irritated my throat and, as another reviewer has noted, the garlic flavor is overpowering and leaves a nasty aftertaste.  I wish I could have given it 1-1/2 stars.
1,I bought these for my husband because he loves these. Well he keeps a bag in his lunch box and he came home one day early and with an upset stomach and didn't leave the bathroom for over 3 hours. This is was all he ate since breakfast. So needless to say, if you have trouble going, then eat a few of these and you will be able to.
1,This oil is touted for it's great popcorn it can make. Well it smokes easily which is annoying and a mess. It turns everything it touches red orange, and frankly doesn't taste that great. I prefer now using pure organic coconut oil which not only doesn't smoke but tastes MUCH better. I had to try it so now I know. Don't waste your money on this stuff.
1,1) the aztecs and mayas roasted cacao. are you going to argue with them ?	2) all studies are done with regular roasted chocolate	3) roasting reduces the phytic acid, oxalic acid, tannins and toxins	4) roasted chocolate tastes better and is safer, like roasted coffee.
1,Not a fan of the taste of these. Won't reorder.
1,This coconut milk is curdled. Although the expiration date is 11/2018 the product is spoiled, and I opened three boxes to make sure it wasn't just one box or manufacture date (the two shrink wrapped sets had different dates).  I have used this brand for years and love it, but would not buy it again from this seller.
1,I was not impressed with these at all.  The consistency was unusual and the cream filling has a lot of sugar granules!  I would not buy these again!
1,I can handle,  and expected,  the bitterness.  What i did not expect and can't  tolerate, is the sourness.  Total turnoff no matter much i try to doctor it up with creamer, cinnamon and stevia.  Just blech.  Sorry, really wanted to love it.  Anyone in marietta ga can have mine for free.  Look up HI-Tech Home Inspections Inc. To find me.  Oh and i have a ton of very expensive high quality kava kava you are welcome to for free.  Easily over $100 worth.  Kava effect is great but its just to nasty tasting.
1,I saw Fritos' orange can and thought, "Bean dip!"  I was disappointed to rip off the lid and find orange ooze.  This was pretty nasty.  Not much real cheese flavor, but lots of strange texture and odd taste.  Ended up throwing it away.  If you need a cheese dip fix, stick with Velveeta and Rotel.
1,NOT made in Alaska as stated by Amazon.  Can clearly states "Product of Thailand".  A really important factor in deciding to purchase this product was thinking it was made in Alaska.  Very dishonest advertising.  Try Bumble Bee salmon which really is made in the US.
1,There is no taste to this Coffee and the price for this is much too high
1,One star is too much! This is the most horrible tasting water yet. Don't they taste this before selling to consumers???? Please people. If your curious buy one bottle and see for yourself. What a waste of money." I DO NOT RECOMMEND"!!!
1,Returned it.  Did not realize it is a light/mild coffee until I got it and saw it on the label.  I've had coffee IN Chiapas and didn't expect this at all.  Amazon kindly took it back, since (at the time, anyway) there wasn't a mention on the website of its mild roast.  Thank you Amazon.
1,Taste & look terrible, and they're grainy, as if sand were mixed in. Shame on Jelly Belly for allowing their name to go on this product.
1,I love this stuff. It is delicious, affordable, dairy free coffee that requires no effort and lets you skip long starbucks lines. You just, grab, shake, and go. Could not ask for anything more. I love it!		Update: what the hell happened to the price? It's double what it was! Outrageous!
1,Not for me.
1,It was a bit "salty" for my taste, however my spouse liked it.
1,I'm disappointed in this product.  The edamame seem to be over roasted--many are brown instead of green and taste burned.  I will not purchase them again.
1,Too hot for my taste, though I understand many will disagree. I just prefer more flavor and less heat. If you are OK with hots of heat, try it as most seem to like or love it.
1,THIS IS A COOKIE THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE ---SO EXCITED TO SEE IT AVAILABLE VIA AMAZON--HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THE PACKAGE WAS TIGHTLY SEALED, THERE WAS INCONSISTENCY IN THE INDIVIDUAL COOKIE PACKAGES.  SOME WERE PERFECT --NICE AND CRISP---HOWEVER THERE WERE FREQUENT EXCEPTIONS TO THIS --- THE COOKIES WE SPONGY --- AND HAD A DIFFERENT TASTE.  THE FRESHNESS DATE WAS NEXT YEAR SOMETIME ---SO DO NOT UNDERSTAND.		DID CONTACT THE ACTUAL SHIPPER WHO SAID THAT THEY DID NOT DEAL WITH THESE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS.		WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN.
1,So gross! So sour! So sweet!  It doesn't make any sense! It doesn't taste anything like pad thai at all! What's weird is there are some really good tasting instant or near-instant pad thai noodles you can make with powder or liquid sauce that taste worlds better than this garbage! I can't believe I made myself choke down the whole bowl! Exclamation point!
1,The taste was not bad, but they were limp. I wanted something crispy that would take the place of chips. So that was extremely disappointing. So, I'm on the hunt again for something else.....
1,Was between this & the plain jane 'multibran' variety during a Warehouse firesale, and am upset I went against previous experience (& thus my instinct) & went for these. The addition of raisins means you get less bran, since they're packaged by weight, and that you also can look forward to some tooth strengthening.
1,These chocolate bars did not agree with my system. I must have a sensitivity to the sugar alcohols.
1,By the time it gets here, they will have MOLD on them, first 20 miles it took 10 days
1,I often buy Bob's Red Mill...however, this mix is not good at all.  I don't know what happened or who approved this, but the biscuits turned out like rocks.  They were dry and hard and that was even when warm.  They were worse when they cooled.  They also had a nasty after-taste.		I hate to say it, but I ended up throwing out the batch I made and throwing out the mix after them.		If someone from Bob's Red Mill reads these reviews...please revamp this mix and I will be happy to try it again!
1,I bought these bars on a whim and what a disapointment.  I guess chia seeds aren't my bag.  Make sure you have a toothbrush or floss within reach because the chia seeds got stuck in my teeth.
1,It's called CalPure... with a long drawn out story on the side about how their farm in Central California grows the best avocados, etc...  But... then on the side of the bottle it says product of Mexico! It's just "bottled" in California.  Oil seems fine, but Is not as advertised!
1,Terrible
1,very difficult to cook stays gritty in the center.  had to have it ground further
1,Preface: I love mushrooms, I love swiss, I love burgers and I love mushroom swiss burgers.		But mother of God, this was none of those things, I had to throw half of it away. Campbell's what is the deal, so disappointed.
1,This sounds like a wonderful product. But..... if it is gluten free, kosher, etc., why not make it with stevia, rather than malitol? I avoid anything with malitol in it. I believe it is a chemical, and personally I don't react well to it.
1,all fat
1,I thought I had just found the "right" stevia. I have been using stevia PURE for over 15 years as I cannot have any SUGAR,(or by any other name).  This is sad because I had to research on the web to find what the true ingredients. Notice that this company says "and other balanced ingredients". What I found is that the FIRST INGREDIENT is DEXTROSE!which is another name for sugar. Pure stevia CONTAINS NO OTHER sweetening ingredients AND DEFINITELY not sugar. So, beware that this stuff will CAUSE the same effects on the blood sugar level as sugar does. What is the point of using stevia if you are trying to avoid sugar?????
1,Not as much flavor in it as the powder that comes in the Kraft box.  I was hoping to save some money.  Disappointed.  I had to add salt and onion powder.
1,Unfortunately it gives me diarrhea when used in dessert recipes.  It works well though when combined with salt and boiled water as a nasal wash, like in a netti pot.  The Xylitol is said to have a slight antibiotic-like property.  1/8 - 1/4 tsp Xylitol with 1/4 - 1/2 tsp salt dissolved in 8 oz of cooled water after it has been boiled.
1,Just their instant tea in a K-cup.  I like Lipton brewed from a tea bag, but this is not that.  After first trying it I noticed it had that bitter after taste all instant tea has.  I bought this to use for ice tea instead of the Twinings English Breakfast.  I opened a K-cup and discovered this is just Lipton's instant tea in a K-cup, and it is extremely over priced.  I would have expected a brewed tea leaf or extract for the price.		I drink tea unsweetened, so if you like that, pass on the Lipton and go with the Twinings, unless you like a lot of sugar in your tea to cover the instant tea taste.
1,The flavor seemed to be affected by the packaging (or it just isn't very good) for first cold press, extra virgin olive oil - it was disappointing.
1,The whole box was stale.  The mentors closest to the edges of the packs rock hard, the centers just kind of stale.
1,I love love love pistachios and the price was pretty decent on these but there are LOTS of rotten, or bitter pistachios.  ugh.
1,Weird chemical taste. Bought out recently by General Mills. Tastes NOTHING like it used to, almost plastic consistency.
1,bad
1,I am a long time fan of their Biodynamic French Roast, and thought I'd give this a try?-		No matter what burr grind (Bonavita coffee maker)...- it left a bitter/lingering after taste, and I tossed it out!
1,The peanuts were fresh and nicely salted, but there were too many pieces of broken shells and other debris we had to pick through.
1,This is not out of anger. It's my fault because although the title doesn't say it's artificial the bottle does; it's blurred but it says it. I am a long-time baker and bake every single week. I couldn't find Rose & Ivy vanilla so this appealed to me as an old-time kind of vanilla. But this is a horrible product. Please be aware. I have no axe to grind just warning you--the flavor is far too heavy and very fake. I'm not a purist-all-natural-foodie-locovore pain in the ass. But I want pure vanilla. I threw the bottle out after 2 uses. Make of this info what you will and happy baking!
1,Ordered Qty 18 of 1.5oz packages of Cranberry and Honey Almonds. Received Qty 6 of 4oz Parmesan Cheese and Herb Almonds.  For some reason, both product labels were on the box so it seems like an honest mistake.  Sahale Snacks make great products; however, I'm not a big fan of the Parmesan or shipping errors. Should I try again and see if the Cranberry/Honey is delivered?  :)
1,I read that this is the "real" cinnamon but it just isn't tasty. I will never buy it again.
1,First off, ALL pork rinds everywhere are carb free, gluten free so there's nothing new there.		I've been eating pork rinds my entire life, so my tastes are pretty defined. I like lighter pork rinds rather than the really crunchy ones, but I still like some crisp. I like a lot of flavor without too much sodium.		These are light, kind of dry, and the flavor is lacking, which is surprising for the 350 mg of sodium. My current favorites have a lot more flavor and less salt, also more crisp. Honestly, I never thought I'd come across a bag of pork rinds I didn't like, but the bag I just opened is going to be hard for me to finish.		If you pork rind tastes are already defined - stick with your favorite. These are like...beginners pork rinds. You could add some seasoned salt to them, but that's kind of lame since they cost a little more than your average bag of pork rinds already. Adding some blackening seasoning improved the flavor for me (of the black pepper ones), but then the odder texture became more noticeable. It might be due to the olive oil used since olive oil doesn't have as high a smoke point as the normal deep frying oils, regardless, using olive oil is not an improvement on pork rinds.
1,I bought a big bag at (a big-box club store). I soaked some and consumed them per the instructions. The taste and consistency is not the least bit appealing.	Kind of slimy and gritty at the same time and nothing at all good to be said about the flavor. Worse than bland / sort of yukky. I can't say that I have any incentive to repeat the experience based how unenjoyable it is to eat it. Good food should taste good too.
1,Bought 1lb of it for a family lunch and it tasted horrible, no one ate it.
1,Product was hard (like old peanut butter), very grainy (I assume the honey and sugar crystallized), inconsistent in the container, I couldn't taste ANY honey, and without any peanut oil (such as in "natural" butter that you have to stir).  Sounded like a good idea; but it went very bad!
1,I bought these for a friend at work who only likes the red Jolly Ranchers so when I saw these I had to get them. She was thrilled that I remembered.
1,I have had the Hershey's and nut spread such as this and it was delicious (although hubby ate most of the jar), so I was really hoping to like this as well. I love almonds and I love chocolate and I love them together. So when I tasted this product, I was seriously underwhelmed. Blah tasting at best. I couldn't for the life of me think of what I would want to spread it on to eat it with or how to use it at all. I asked hubby to try it and since it has been around for awhile I figured time to find out how he liked it. He also was underwhelmed and it takes a lot for him to get to that stage about any food.		All I can figure is that the makers are trying to appeal to too many people and too many weird diets, to make it tasty to people that do have sugar, salt, etc. in their diets. I'd say leave it for the granola crowd except I eat granola every morning. If you are interested, take a chance. But do look at all the things it doesn't contain before deciding if you want to buy it.
1,Horrible.  First ingredient is water.
1,Did not work out for me.  I tried all different amounts trying to get it right (even bought the tiny measuring spoons).  I either did not notice sweetness at all, or got the after taste.  You may have better luck.
1,Use to LOVE these and were a go to until they started giving me migraines! Natural Flavors (which as most know are not natural) cause this with me. Very upsetting since Kind bars were a daily go-to snack!!!
1,These didn't do very well here at our house, but may for others. The fruit was a bit too sour for me and expected a little more flavor. seemed the variety wasn't the best either.
1,5 stars for the taste and product on normal purchase 1 star for the expiration date being 11 days away on this batch		Got the box and the package was a little rough. I looked inside the case and noticed the color of the cheese was a little off. Checked the expiration date and they showed 1/14/17. While I imagine the product would still be ok to eat beyond that, I'm not typically a person that will eat food beyond recommended by dates.
1,Unimpressive, especially for the price.
1,Wasn't quite what I was hoping.  Looking for a good olive oil for bread dipping, this had an after taste that I've had too often w/ too many olive oils.  Pricey too.  I finally found a great olive oil at my local italian restaurant and less expensive than this.
1,Not so much...		Please stop showing this to me as a 'Buy this again' ad.  I couldn't give it away!
1,It's supposed to be the same as the already diluted version you buy in bottles, but it is definitely not.	First of all there are no instructions at all, OPEN IT, SQUEEZE IT, ENOY is the only thing that barely classifies as instructions for morons.		How much do you squeeze in what amount of water or other liquid in order to get the same taste ?	No one knows, no one will know, Coca-Cola Company trying to get us to die from cancer AND now aneurysms from trying to figure out their products.
1,I was looking for a powder that is 100% lime juice, but it contains maltodextrin. Maltodextrin is not bad, it's a simple starch, which commonly comes from corn or potatoes. However, it adds calories.
1,The chocolate was melted in clumps when I got it.
1,This just tastes like plain mint tea. Very unhappy.
1,The noodles have a shelf life. They are not twinkies. If the pkg is damaged and air gets in they go bad. 3 times of this case I bought made me throw up. This is without even using the flavor packet. I opened a few more and didn't like the smell of them. They didn't smell bad, just different. Anyway, I threw the rest of the case out. Tired of getting food sick on anything slightly off. No more ramen for me for a while. OTOH, it's really hard to get plain mushroom ramen so I'll give the seller a thumbs up for providing it.
1,Grana Padano has a special grainy texture --- this one did -- but it didn't have much of the nutty/buttery flavor I expected.  I'm thinking this piece just didn't travel well through the post.  Sorry.
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!  There were only 3 colors, red, green, and white, PLAIN sprinkles, no mix.  False advertising and picture.
1,Ive used this tea for a little while and liked the fact it makes you want to go restroom. However, this time Ive had an internal bleeding when using restroom.		Please use with caution. Im not sure if this tea is legitimate for frequent drinking.
1,I am so sorry to say that i did not enjoy these at all. I have hardly even eaten one whole cracker and it actually makes me sad because Health Valley is a trusted name to me and my family. We have never had a product from Health valley that we did not like til these crispbreads. I have such a bland diet and i can eat just about anything short of cardboard and I really do apologize for saying this but they were and are disgusting. It wouldn't bother me so much if they were not so expensive but they were and I am stuck with them .  I wish I could get my money back!!!!
1,Was greasy and too much packaging on the small sticks. Decent value	My husband is not picky at all he will eat almost anything, and ate them, but he did not want me to reorder them.
1,The cookies are delicious, but 3 out of 4 boxes were crushed
1,My bad, there is a noticeable difference between Hazelnut and Classic Hazelnut!  Make sure you order the one you really want/like.
1,The description says pure tea with natural flavors, but the natural flavors are awful and not tea!!  It tastes like licorice, vanilla, and some odd spice.  I hated it both hot and iced.  If I can't find someone to give it to, I'll throw the rest away.  I want plain old Lipton black tea!!
1,May be okay if you have young children. What a terrible way to snack on favorite Pringles if you are an adult! Tiny little packages mean you have to use half your order the 1st time you snack.
1,The K-cup blew up and we ended up with coffee grounds in the cup.  The feeling was that if the k-cup was that attention to detail lacking that perhaps the coffee might be too.  Some in our family feared drinking it.  I was experimenting and purchased a few favors and/or types.  It was a waste of my money in my opinion.
1,every can has a dent on each side next to the seal at the top like someone took a hammer to bust the seal before they were packed that is 1 inch deep to 1/2 an inch deep at the top.
1,I received the coffee today and was very disappointed because the can was badly dented in 2 places with some kind of black powder along the rim when I opened the lid.
1,These tapioca "PEARLS" are not Tapioca Pearls. They are more like Tapioca BB's. These are smaller than rice. do not buy these for BOBA or Bubble drinks because they are not the right item. YOU CAN NOT RETURN FOOD ITEMS so if you buy this you will have to keep it.
1,Its disgusting!
1,I only had a teaspoon of this and my stomach was not happy. I wasn't too impressed with the taste either, just OK.
1,Amazon had a great deal with a subscribe and save so I thought I would try out the product.  Only 5 calories per serving and no artificial sweeteners?  Why not give it a try?  It was cheap enough where I wouldn't care if I didn't like it.		I first tried the Clementine.  The taste was a little strange - very artificial like and a slightly strange aftertaste. I had a bottle that I thought I could finish before the end of the day but I just couldn't.  Into the trash it went.  Interestingly enough my friends kids came up and wanted to have some juice.  I only had the bai but I told my friend it tasted really, really bad and told them to drink coconut water instead.  For some reason they really wanted the orange so I told my friend to go ahead and take one but it's really bad.  He poured a couple of cups for his kids, took a sip and had the worst look on his face.  We wondered if it wasn't good for the kids but it seemed natural so he let his kids try it.  They were so excited to try it and my friend I were intently watching to see how they would react.  The youngest one that is three was trying to drink it but was having a hard time.  the oldest one that is five was drinking it for much longer.  We were surprised.  In any case, the younger one gave up early and gave it back and the oldest one eventually said the drink smells funny and gave it back too.  In any case, 1 star for the Clementine.		The Sumatra Dragonfruit I give 2 stars - it's okay.  Drinkable in small portions.  There is no way I can finish a whole bottle, it just has a weird after taste to me that gradually gets worse.  So it actually tasted decent in the beginning but now that I've been drinking it for a while it's getting worse and worse.  If it was good for the whole bottle I'd give it 3 stars.		I still haven't tried the other ones - the drinks have been sitting in my fridge for a couple of weeks and I just don't want to try them.		I'll update the review if one of the other flavors is outstanding.  But for now I've been drinking more water, less soda and almost no bai.
1,In the description and the listing title, it saidnit was organic but nowhere on the bag does it say organic.  Also, this is the only "raw" vanilla bean powder that says "do not refrigerate".... Thats odd to me as well.  I don't think I would buy this brand again.
1,Most of the fruit lacked flavor,  I assume the fruit was picked prior to ripening.  This should be addressed by the company.
1,taste is vile
1,When I received the expiration date was less than a month away!
1,I think this is the third time I ordered this product. The first time I made a batch of Pizzelles it seemed a little light with just one bottle so the next time I used 2 bottles. and it was just ok. in fact, some people asked where is the anise in this cookie. I then made them again and used 3 bottles in the batch and it tasted like i just added 3 bottles of water in the cookie dough. I have 7 bottles left, which I obviously will not use.
1,Tiny raisins. I was hoping for large soft yellow Sultana raisins. These are so disappointing. Dark yellow brown and very small. This item cannot be returned or I surely wouldve.
1,Tried on several machines and on none of them did we get more than a few mouths-full.  Did not work well at all.
1,These were barley salted and I don't like unsalted peanuts.  These were as close to that as I have ever tasted.  I purchased these to snack at work and by far the worst food purchase I have ever made on amazon.  Very disappointed.
1,I bought this highly over priced for a TINY jar of honey after suggestions that a spoonful of this on an empty stomach followed by a mastic pill, would cure my ulcer. I haven't noticed any difference and the jar is almost done. I was going to order one more to give it a lil longer to work but then I noticed the price jumped $2 freaking bucks since my last order and since I never buy things that jump in price more than 25 cents ea increase, now this is off my list of things I'll buy. grumble, grumble
1,Pure salt!  Tastes nasty!  Forget it.
1,some of the olives in the packages were moldy.  not a good thing.  horrible
1,The clue came with the packaging! All the printing was duplicated in Chinese writing. Not what we expect from a unique part of the good ole British Institution. The pack did say it was imported from the UK, but I am wary of the Chinese influence. Is it not bad enough that the UK and USA buy so much Chinese junk, but they have to destroy our cookies? Yes destroy!!  The cookies are smaller, the Chocolate is much thinner (I could see the biscuit through the Chocolate), and the biscuit itself tastes much cheaper. It tastes lije the cheap biscuits from companies who once aspired to be like McVitties. I wouldn't buy these again
1,THEY CHANGED IT TO A WEAK WATERED DOWN COFFEE.
1,Seriously? $51 for a single 8 oz. Jar?  I hope this is a typo....
1,Some people may care for it, but not me.
1,I did not like this flavor and would not buy it again.
1,I cannot eat popcorn. I was looking for a suitable substitute. I thought these might do the trick after reading the reviews. Had to throw them away. Other people may like them but for me they taste pretty much like stale cardboard. Worst snack I have ever tasted.
1,It tastes like cardboard with a subtle flavoring of mocha.  The granola bar is so dry and tasteless, I have to drink something with it in order to even swallow.  I love most Kashi products, but this one fails imho.
1,I wanted to get this for Christmas, having a little taste testing parting (much like wine, but it's candy). I LOVE Haribo Gummy anythings! The package was on time, safe, nothing was torn or fused together from heat - it was perfect shipping. However, the quality of these particular gummies were not great, they were very, very hard and stale. I was disappointed in the quality. I only got this as a one time thing, but it's not worth the money just to chew on stale candy. Sorry, but the shipping was better than the product itself.
1,Product not fresh.
1,This product is advertised fraudulently.  I bought this pack of 3 on Amazon because I enjoy snacking on plain dry roasted peanuts which, last time I checked, was a standard item that Planters makes.  These are NOT plain.  They are coated in no less than three types of sugar, along with a host of spices and additives.  Thumbs DOWN for Planters by this low-carb dieter.
1,While the Amazon listing says it's raw, I see nothing on the package that says "raw". This is significant as toasted buckwheat is not interchangeable with raw buckwheat in recipes.
1,No flavor. Does not taste like soy milk
1,The bags came taped together in a huge box with no protection other than the tape.  Most of the chips, so far, are very broken.  They were sent with two heavier items; the box and tape on the box itself were torn and a mess.  It's the first time I'm truly disappointed with Amazons policy of cramming everything in as few boxes as possible.  It was extremely hard to handle, and harmed the product.
1,Good product but really expensive for the amount.
1,It stated lightly salted, but I didn't detect any salt at all.  So I ordered the heavily salted version and it was the same.
1,Not enough fruit, the only taste that comes through besides the oats are the sunflower seeds, and there are not enough of those to offset	how many oats are in this. It is chewy, and not in a good way.	My initial impression of this was it tastes like something you would feed a horse, and it didn't get any better after the first bite.		Not recommended
1,i like the 18oz can but not these ones. these ones taste like crap all 3 types compared to the can one. both from amazon
1,i've been trying out different pumpkin spice flavored cereals lately. the best two so far are special k pumpkin spice, and mini wheats pumpkin spice. i tried this one today and it's gross, it doesn't taste like pumpkin, rather the spice of the pumpkin. not enough pumpkin flavor. not natural tasting. tastes more like cheerios with some shake on it or something. either way stay away, worst cereal i've tasted that calls itself pumpkin, and that's saddening because i'm actually a big fan of cheerios products. i like every other flavor of cheerios including apple cinnamon, protein, frosted, etc. try again general mills :(
1,Tried using this as a rub for grilling and also as a marinade. Didn't work at all. Made our chicken bright pink and had a slight curry taste at best. No one in the family liked it. Was a waste of a purchase.
1,Melted and reset I'd guess.
1,I like sweet tarts and love licorice so I was very disappointed in this candy. The licorice is very chewy, and when you first bite into the rope, it has a flora-like chemical taste. then the tanginess of the sweetart does not mesh at all with the rather offputting taste of the licorice.	Nice concept but not pulled off well.		The flavor alone dissaudes me from buying anymore.
1,OK product settles some in shipping but there's room for at least a cup more in the can. Too pricey and deceptive packaging. Remember when ice cream came in a half gallon container? When coffee came in a 3 pound can? THEY'RE ALL RIPPING US OFF!
1,Too sweet
1,Worst looking manuka UMF 20 I've ever seen!  This can not be UMF 20 manuka honey.  I will not put something that looks like this into my body!.  I've tried ALL the UMF 20 honey's.  Take my advice, DO NOT BUY THIS HONEY.
1,I received a box of crushed Ramen... and a bunch of empty bags. Whoever was on the production line	must have taken a time out ... to let this damaged product get by ... No, I won't buy again nor recommend others buy the product.
1,crap
1,Coffee is not in filter pods, so you still need to buy filters separate.
1,lid was loose upon receipt would not even attempt to try them sent for a full refund but still how does a lid become loose in transit?
1,Flavor is great, but the plastic the "pod" is made of is a softer plastic that my Keurig sometimes has a hard time puncturing the bottom...when that happens it really makes a mess. I strongly recommend that they find a different source for their plastic "pods", and also, if you choose to purchase and use these (as I do) double check that when you insert and then close your machine that it did in fact puncture the bottom of the "pod".
1,Strong chemical taste....I don't understand the good ratings
1,This product fell tragically short of my needs. It may very well work better in drinks other than the one I tried to use it for, but I was too put off by the result I got to try another.
1,Terrible. Tastes nothing like a Kona.  Very weak coffee with no taste.  A waste of money.
1,page says "superior to peanut butter with 1/3 the saturated fat".  the truth is it has 2/3.		one serving has 2 grams of saturated fat.  peanut butter, 3.  that makes 2/3 of the amount in peanut butter, not 1/3.		how can you trust people who make a big mistake like that?
1,Not what I expected in the taste category.
1,I love earl grey, love green tea, and love this brand...but I did not enjoy this particular flavor, and neither did my mother. it does not taste earl grey-ish at all, and we did not find it very pleasant. there is just too much going on all at once, and everything clashes (rose petals? in an earl grey? what a waste..). the poor bergamot is just drowned out in all of the competing flavors. if you are looking for a very nice earl grey tea, I highly recommend the beautiful Earl Greys made by Mighty Leaf or Numi (Numi's decaf and regular Earl Greys are both potent and aromatic, and just perfect to take your mind somewhere else. also, they are made with dried bergamot--not essence, or perfume, of). if you are looking for green tea, we recommend a nice sencha (Numi makes a very nice and smooth one too, but you can also find superior green teas at any japanese market). for a Zhena tea, we recommend the Fireside Chai with high praise, but will steer you away from their more designer flavored chais--ie, the caramel chai, which is also a weirdo (if anyone has any recommendations on any other brilliant flavors by Zhena, I would really appreciate a recommendation!). cheers! : )
1,Lifesavers were old. Tasted bad
1,I purchased some of these last fall and they were very good.  I just purchased another bag and they smell and taste old or stale.  Guess I should have waited for the new crop.  I wanted these for eating as a snack but can only use them for cooking.
1,I used it to write on white chocolate and it looks like crayon. It isn't very liquidy. You have to go over your writing many times causing it to look sloppy. I won't buy them again.
1,I like several other Mcdougall's soups for a quick lunch at work, but not this one.  The noodles just didn't soften enough to be enjoyable.  Perhaps it was my method, because I use a lower setting on the microwave.  If I don't, the water boils out over the cup.  I will have to experiment on the rest of these and see if I can find the solution to uncooked noodles.
1,The cookies are wonderful.  Sadly, like nearly all cookies I order from Amazon at least half are broken.
1,I hate it when manufacturers chose to use misleading terms and try making the product more desirable than it actually is.	Yes, Natural it is, but not really when its got added 'natural' unneeded crap. Can't stand when some live-and-eat-by-manufacturer americans who couldn't care less or are ignorant upvote an unhealthy product. Unhealthy only because they add unneeded sugar and palm oil..heck they could have just added HFCS and these same reviewers would have given them 5 stars still ! Wake up America !! Get off the coke !! "NATURAL" my &&&
1,I was so excited to finally see this in stock again that I immediately purchased it. Sad to say it's not the same as it used to be. I love my campbell's chunky steak and potato soup. Unfortunately, after three cans, hoping that 1 or 2 were mistakes, I'm renaming this Campbell's Potato and Steak Soup. I had to look closely to find the steak. As well, the soupy part was thinner than I remembered. I used to eat this with buttered biscuits but now I just want to get through the cans so I can find something better.
1,Not good since caffeine is too high.
1,I love maple syrup and use it on pancakes, waffles and to pour over vanilla ice cream. I found this brand (grade b) to have a bitter taste. Recommend buying a different brand.
1,These taste like they are 100 year old mummified goji berries.  They are so hard that they hurt my teeth.  These are the worst goji berries I've ever had.  There is a difference between "dried" and "petrified".
1,I just really didn't care for this Italian Dark Roast decaf coffee.  It was a little too bitter for me.
1,Chicken was gross
1,when using the k-cups they would crack open when brewing, not good, all the tea would go into the	cup and couldn't drink it.
1,This package arrived with the box closed by interlocking the 4 ends. The truvia packs were loose in the box no plastic bag, no indication of the count aside from what was printed on the box. The individual packs are labeled but for a food product I would expect some form of protection for the product. I ordered a replacement and apparently all the sellers ship this in a similar fashion. If it doesn't concern you then be my guest. It wouldn't take much to show some concerns for food safety.
1,Wow, if this is the only thing you can get in Europe, I feel sorry for them. After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that companies consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, Keneco Crema & Twinings Chai Latte aren't bad if you add sugar and flavorings. I use a combination of Coffee-Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount). I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee. Some tasted like I just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the T-discs I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema, Jacob's Macchiato and Milka Hot Chocolate. After finding one inferior brew after another, I'm going back to my regular coffee pot for some decent black coffee. To be fair, you can take all these inferior coffees except the Maxwell House House Blend, and make a nice latte or cappaccino. Maxwell House House, resisted all my efforts to improve the flavor. I'll never buy this one again. Note: The Chai Latte has a lingering aftertaste of...dirt?, but is still the best of the bunch in my opinion.
1,Although it is great that this is an organic tea, I would not have known this was Earl Grey except that it said so on the box.  The taste and smell of bergamot were negligible.  I will not be purchasing this again.
1,The candy is fine - the production is a failure.		If the temperature gets above 65 degrees you can expect to lose more than half the bag to being stuck to the wrapper.		I suppose you could dig it with your hands, because nothing's more appetizing than taffy you paw around with before eating. Yum!		What's annoying is that this is an obvious problem - in testing they no doubt encountered this and instead of doing anything about it they just want ahead and sold the candy anyway.		Candy = fine. But since you're not going to get your money's worth, it's a one-star product.
1,was disappointed - the nuts don't taste fresh.  they taste like they were shelled and packaged quite some time ago.
1,Doesn't taste like I remembered.  Probably purchased the wrong brand
1,not that great and still high in calories regardless of whether they are 0 carb.
1,I found this coffee to be bitter, somewhat stale, and it just wasn't good.  I know coffee being great is a subjective thing so I will say that I prefer a "bright (acid)", medium roast without smokey, chocolate, or ashy tones. So maybe this was just the wrong coffee for me.
1,dry and bland
1,Very bland. I home roast to achieve increased flavor. This bean doesn't offer it. Roasted from first crack to FullCity+ without different results. Certainly sub-standard for a Peruvian high grown. I won't buy this again.
1,We have had Veggie Straws many times, but the chips had an oily smell as though stored at a high temperature, and tasted old. This 24 pack was a waste of money, can't get the family to eat them, no matter how "starved" they are. Will stick with the straws going forward, very disappointed - no stars at all.
1,Should have been better.  Tasted like Yuban coffee.  I have been reviewing 17 different brands of concentrate, This was third to the last.
1,taste is off, and it's so runny, so many of these are soooo runny, guess I will stick with regular PB
1,Not much flavor. The usual dried fruit.
1,These mints have a really strange aftertaste.  I do not like them at all!
1,Not enough flavor.
1,I loved the 5 alarm chili peanuts.  But, these are way too hot.  I took them to a party and no one ate them because they were too hot.
1,I was rather disappointed with this coffee. I drink medium and light roast flavored coffee all the time and these seemed like they were a great price. Unfortunately the flavors didn't really come through. If you are looking for a coffee with a hint of flavor (maybe other flavored coffees come across too flavored for you) than these might be ideal for you. I was expecting a touch more.
1,I love the suckers, but not the flavors I got.  The description said: "One 30oz plastic bin containing 125 lollipops, mix of sour apple tart, pomegranate pucker, mango tango, too berry blueberry, googly grape, strawberry smash, very cherry, wet-face watermelon flavors".  Mine ONLY has strawberry, pomegrante, watermelon and peach.  First of all, I LOVE cherry and raspberry, and was REALLY looking forward to the new apple and too bery flavors (new to me).  I am TOTALLY disappointed.
1,I was disappointed by the flavor of this coffee.  I didn't find it particularly rich or special.  Considering the insanely high price, it was not a good purchase.
1,Bad flavor like water imitation chocolate, unpleasant texture. I like my brownies moist and cakey, this was more undone.
1,I love this coffee, have been drinking it every morning for 2 years.... And they bumped the price by 25% basically overnight... Forget about it.
1,The entire box was melted. They are not edible.
1,I love bacon and I love jalapenos.  I didn't like this product.  The two probably just don't go together.
1,These were not that tasty and had a weird texture. I would not buy these again. Even tried to make trail mix with them but ate everything but these.
1,not the same as the Half and half they made before .very dissapointed
1,Another horseradish product masquerading as wasabi. At the least the price is low. Real Wasabi is rare, expensive and when exposed to air deteriorates rapidly.		In the USA and reportedly often in Japan "Wasabi" is a mix of horseradish and a little mustard with a bit of food coloring		At my local supermarket I can buy a massive horseradish root for about a dollar.
1,This bottle did not taste right. More like a butterscotch. Which I don't like.
1,I have had other black tea from Russia and was looking forward to a robust, earthy flavor. I especially was wanting the full leaf for what I consider the uncompressed brewing advantage. My teapot, purchased in Limoges, France, is designed to extract the full flavor from the leaf. Alas, I found little of the full flavor in this tea. Increasing both the quantity of tea used and brewing time achieved little. I would not buy it again.
1,This rice mix has good seasoning and good flavor with a moderate amount of spice, however it is highly salty if you make it as per the instructions on the box.
1,I've used this in both coffee and tea and I just can't get used to the after-taste it leaves behind.		This isn't the only bad part--the flavor it self isn't very sweet. In fact, I find it slightly bitter.		I'll stick to raw sugar and the occasional Splenda as my sweetner of choice.
1,Took these to work and the consensus was these were not very good.
1,This is a dark roast coffee. Was not expecting that.
1,Not sure where people are finding the "pumpkin spice" flavor. My wife and I use travel cups on our way to work, and use 1 pod in our brewer. If you plan to use this on the highest setting (volume), then you will be disappointed. If you want a small cup of coffee, it may be alright. I guess we could use 2 pods for 1 travel mug, but that kinda defeats the purpose. We use Peets, S-Bucks, Donut Shop, and other pods at our fullest setting for our travel mugs with creamer, and no problems with "light" or "watery" coffee. This pods produces a very weak, watery, tasteless cup. If you brew small cups in your Keurig, then Im sure it would be fine, But its not for more than a 4-6 oz. cup.
1,I ordered this product and the oberto BBQ pork jerky at the same time and I would absolutely buy the BBQ pork again but not this one. It is very mealy, which I am betting is the case for all turkey jerky. The flavor seemed a little stale relative to the BBQ pork jerky too. I am all for making healthy choices but the trade-offs for this turkey jerky simply aren't worth it. BBQ pork jerky here I come!!!
1,The texture and the taste were just a little different.  This is likely obvious, however, I thought I may as well give it a try.  It just was not for me.
1,The guys I hang out with like to spray this into their faces, then veer into the oncoming path of my War Machine in some misguided attempt to find Valhalla. You wanna go to Valhalla, boys? No spray necessary; I'll send you there myself.
1,Nasty taste.
1,Terrible
1,Date on lid was intentionally rubbed out.  When we opened them they were bad.  NO MORE FOOD ITEMS.. SICK OF GETTING RIPPED OFF!!!!!!
1,Intensely strong odor and flavor.  People twenty feet away were complaining about the smell.  How on earth did these get labeled "very mild flavor"?
1,these are nuggets and I had hoped that I would be able to use the mortar and pestle to make them more the size that I wanted, but I just end up with a powder instead of a course grain. So it was a disappointment to in the way I had imagined using it.
1,These have a funky aftertaste.  Much prefer the dark chocolate with sea salt flavor.
1,I like the other flavors I've tried, but this one tastes floral to me. I water down my Hint waters because I like a weaker taste, but even watering this one down, it was awful. As another described, it's almost like a perfume taste. I'm sad because now I can't buy the mixed flavor sets because the pomegranates will go in the trash.
1,I'm not allergic to any foods.  This Thanksgiving I went to my sisters, she made gravy withRed's  Zanthan Gum.  Shortly after sampling the gravy I had a severe anaphylaxis reaction; my face looked like a puffer fish, my heart was racing, vertigo, my tongue started to swell - an Epi Pen had to be administered to prevent possible death.		I'd caution against use of this or at a minimum do your research! I'd say Gluten is much safer than Xanthan Gum. Although Xanthan Gum is in many foods as a preservative, this product by is used in excess to what most food manufacturers include in their products.  Please at least look up Xanthan Gum in Wikipedia or other reliable sources before using.		Certainly would never give to children!  Also, google "Simply Thick"(includes ingredient Xanthan Gum) to see new FDA recommendations based on numerous deaths, and ongoing lawsuits, of babies dying a direct result of Simply Thick added to their formula.
1,It's just ok would not purchase again no hint of rhubarb
1,Not what I was expecting! I love pumpkin desserts, bread and lattes, but this did not taste like pumpkin. It doesn't even have decent flavor, I poured my first cup down the drain. I love all Gevalia coffees, cappacinnos and lattes, but will not purchase this one again.
1,Worst tea ever. Four different flavors and I couldn't tell the difference, they all taste the same--awful. Tried one of each flavor and disposed of the rest. One swallow of each flavor was all I could handle.
1,Not my thing.  First time I tried this.  A lot of people love it, but t's not for me.  It was pretty gross.  Beans in watery ketchup...I couldn't imagine eating this on toast. Ugh.
1,Most of the fruit in this variety pack wasn't very good. The mango tasted really off, it had a tomato like smell and slight taste to it. Not sure how that happened! The pineapple had a very bizarre texture and smelled really icky when you opened the package. The apricot was fine but the apple was very good. My variety pack actually didn't come with the banana kind, oddly enough. I'd probably buy the apple kind again, but I'd be reluctant to try anything else from this company.
1,I love molasses but this stuff tasted awful
1,No taste other than slightly salty.  Disappointed after reading other reviews.
1,This is without a doubt, the worst green tea I have ever tasted.  It smells and tastes like topical antiseptic and I think it is making my tongue numb.		I've gone running back to Twinings.
1,I doubt how much royal jelly is in the jar... Besides it's way too sweet. It's much sweeter then normal honey.
1,I'm not disputing that it may be good for us, but YUCK! My husband and I are trying valiantly to get through a bottle of this "juice", but it isn't anything like the acai berry juice we've purchased elsewhere. The other tasted like boysenberry; this tastes "just not good". Which is why it's probably better for us. But there's no sense in our buying it if we're not going to drink it, so this is our first and last bottle.
1,Let me start out first by saying that my review is a review based off of my experience and is not to deter anyone from buying this product.  I'm writing this review based off of my own observation and usage of this product.	I take Omega 3 fish oil pills.  I've been doing so since 2005.  My cholesterol level went from 150 to 125 and that makes me feel truly great.  Since I knew these Omega 3's were helping me, I decided to purchase more.  While I was doing so I came across this chia seed description.  What caught my eye was that it stated that it was 3 times as better as the Omega 3 and learned it did more that what the Omega 3 pills are suppose to do so I decided to buy the 3lb bag instead of my regular fish oil pills.  I purchased them Feb. 2 and started taking them on Feb. 6.  By close to the end of last month I stopped taking these chia seeds because of the amount of weight I gained.  Back in Dec. '08 I weighed 128 lbs.  My weight fluctuates between this and 132.  Two weeks ago I was at 141lbs!!  No lie.  I'm 34 years old and this is the first time in my entire life I ever weighed that much.  These chia seeds doesn't curb your appetite at all.  The water these seeds absorbs comes back on you.  Now I will admit it did help my intestines and my urine was straw yellow gold but I couldn't tell if it did anything else.  I didn't have extra energy, it didn't hydrate me at all when I did my work out.  I did the treadmill 3 times a week at 30 minutes each, cardio for another 3 weeks at 30-45 minutes each, and the only thing I gained from those chia seeds was an extra 9lbs in three weeks.  Since I've gone back to my Omega 3 fish oil pills my weight has gone back down to 133.  Now I have 2lbs of chia seeds in my cabinet collecting dust.  I never want to weigh this much again.
1,Beautiful tin, but the best by date is 9/02/2016. Wow!! I opened the tin to test a piece and they were hard as rocks and stalE.
1,There's a very good reason for the disclaimer on this website.  These pumpkin seeds are imported from China (!) by a company called Yankee Traders.  Ignore the fact they're called "pepitas" which made me think they might be from Mexico, if imported (which wasn't mentioned, either).  Then there's the label which mentions that these seeds are processed in a facility that "also processes products containing peanuts, tree nuts, soy, fish, milk, egg, crustacean shellfish and wheat ingredients."  I'm not allergic to any of those, but nonetheless after consuming about a half cup of these as a snack in the afternooon and at bedtime, I woke up with a headache, upset digestive system and other unpleasantness. Considering all the accusations regarding poisoned pet and for-human products that are Chinese-grown, made or processed, which have been in the news over the last few years, I can't help but worry about these seeds.  I guess that's what I get for not wearing my glasses to examine the label carefully before consuming a new product.  So much for healthy snacking -- you shouldn't buy these if you do have allergies, or if you have concerns about Chinese food-related imports.
1,Did not receive the full shipment. I received the jet fuel coffee which is great, bold and strong but did not received the black tiger so I can't rate that coffee.
1,I couldn't wait to get these to use as a snack and also to use in recipes. I hope I can find other uses for them rather than as a snack, because they are bitter and really doesn't even taste like chocolate.  I am not a raw fooder, although I do have a couple of raw food cookbooks, so take that into consideration.  I have no idea what I'm going to do with $25 worth of raw cacao nibs now.  I even went to the web site to get recipes but there were none.  Geez.......
1,The bags invariably have tiny crumpled chips.  NOT Amazon's fault, was packed well. Esp. bad taste when eating crumples of mixed chips and agree with others they are not fresh at all.	This is a perfect example of horrible manufacture QC.
1,Sugar alcohols disagree with me, wildly so, so when I saw this low-cal chocolate bar with the big claim on the front that said, sweetened with stevia, I was all over it! Low sugar and not going to cause digestion ills? Yay!		Unfortunately this company's claims are extremely misleading, Erythritol, a sugar alcohol, is the third ingredient on the list. I opened my chocolate bar and with one taste it was obvious it was not sweetened with stevia as the primary sweetener. Stevia is included, but erythritol is one of the main ingredients!		I don't think companies should lie like that. I don't feel I can trust them on any front, if they make misleading claims on the front of the bar. I won't be considering any future products from this brand.		(the chocolate bar did taste good, if you are not sensitive to that odd, cool mouth sensation of sugar alcohols and they don't give you tummy problems.)
1,I had been getting the Almond milk quite regularly thru Amazon until I got a 6 pack that tasted spoiled... yuck... the expiration date was still 3 months in the future, but every one of the 6 pack cartons that I tasted was bad... if I ever do order again I will taste test every carton before I add to cooking recipes... yuck, I had been adding these to my daily oatmeal without taste testing and it makes me sick just to think we'd been drinking spoiled crap.
1,Sodium Benzoate is a synthetic (preservative) added to this product.
1,This is the most foul tasting thing I have ever had. Literally tasted like poisonous plant material and strongly too. I have been drinking teas for a long time and jasmine is my favorite so I thought i would give this a try. What a waste of money. At least i can save the tin to put my regular jasmine tea bags in. DO NOT BUY THIS!
1,I didn't taste this- my husband did and he said it was gross. He usually likes things like this. Glad I didn't buy it. It was free as part of some promotion since I bought something else.
1,They should rename this pickle salad with a little chicken.  What happened Bumble Bee?  The last three orders of this have had pickles cut the size of veggies in	The chunky veggie beef soup.  And they are sweet pickles no less.  The tuna salad has been fine.  Did you change your  recipe?  Or your vender for pickles?  I will not continue to purchase the chicken salad if this is your new blend.	I hope the ham salad I just ordered is not like that!!'	!	I prefer pickles on the side best.  Perhaps a separate package of pickles
1,really wanted the coffee taffy espresso  disappointed
1,I only tried this because of everyone raving about pumpkin spice everything.  I was not impressed and would not order it again.
1,Doesnt taste like anything but the noodles by themself have good texture.
1,I used it with tea and it was nasty.  Took one taste and I threw it out.  Yuk  I only used 5 drops.  I tried with less and it was still yukkky.
1,Had always heard of Annie's and decided it was time to try it. Horrible. Dry. Powdery. Tasteless. Going back to Kraft.
1,My 4-pack of gum arrived completely covered with white labels that are difficult/impossible to remove without damaging the cartons.  This is extremely frustrating since this is the sort of item one purchases for the novelty packaging and not the chewing gum inside.
1,No taste, to oily!
1,Ugh
1,Too dry in my opinion
1,It may just be me, but this gum makes my tongue feel super sore a few hours after I chew it and I get lie bumps all over. Makes it very hard to eat and I can't taste anything...but like I said, may just be me. My mouth does not like this gum.
1,Needs to be mixed with something pretty potent in order for me to be able to drink this. Way too expensive considering the amount you get and horrible taste.
1,I wanted to give this to someone for a gift. The Amazon both was perfect. The Starbucks canister was dented in 3 places & powder was leaking out. Will hv to keep for myself.
1,They were totally melted and therefore not very good. I should ask for refunds but I just am not that kind of person. I will never buy again.
1,Flavor isn't great. Even the other flavors aren't that good.
1,Food To Live Brazil Nuts:  I used to enjoy these nuts... but the last large group I bought were somewhat soft and stale feeling.  So I bought a new one pound bag, and was disappointed again.  This time the nuts were fresh but almost tasteless.  No more Brazil nuts.  Going to cashews or something else.  They have become too expensive, and they don't taste delicious like they used to.
1,I love the item, but this is the second box I've received that has been stale!
1,stale
1,tastes nothing like blueberry, and i felt like i was punishing myself to drink it. I much prefer the detox tea.
1,The batter was just like can of pumpkin pie filling than pancake batter constitute ! And I love Kodak original pancake mix only !
1,Not impressed. Tea isn't very strong in flavor.
1,For a great Earl Grey at reasonable price, try Culinary Circle Earl Grey sold at Shaws supermarkets. I love Earl Grey,but it has to have a good strong flavor and aroma of Bergamot which is only found in teas that have Bergamot oil as an ingredient.  Twinings Earl Grey teabags have "Bergamot flavor" (not Bergamot oil and most likely less expensive).  It has a fake, almost bland flavor and aroma. Might as well buy straight black tea it is much less expensive.
1,way too strong even watered down the rum taste is overwhelming!
1,Before I bought this, I read the reviews.  There were several raves and a few who said it tasted AWFUL.  Since I have always loved seaweed, I bought it.  I found it inedible.  I am definitely confused by the rave reviews.  Perhaps I got a bad batch?  It tasted like lobster bait smells.  (For those of you who don't live on the Maine coast, bait is fish for the lobster traps.  It is bought in batches stored in barrels in the sun.)  I used it under my tomato plants at transplanting time.  The plants grew well.
1,Not for us.  Too salt, not enough taste of the chocolate.
1,Didn't like the combo of V8 juice and strawberry banana..... too much V8.....
1,creepy ingrediants, daughter threw out
1,Very disappointing in several ways. They are tough, and are not 'cored' which makes them tougher to chew, and just plain boring. Won't buy these again.
1,Something has changed with this formula. The aftertaste is not just as bad as the rest.
1,Does not taste better than coffee!!
1,Sweet summer in a bottle
1,89% alcohol or 178 proof, almost pure alcohol, I might try it in cooking, but not in a smoothie,given I'm not a drinker. I suppose I could use it as an disinfectant as it has a higher alcohol content that most rubbing alcohol and it should a be consumable grade alcohol unlike rubbing alcohol which is usually wood alcohol.
1,Too much SALT
1,refound is not enough
1,I LOVE jerky, but this is just horrible!  All four bags were disappointing.  The soy sauce flavor in all of them is overwhelming, and they all have a bitter aftertaste.  Two bags were far too moist, the Teriyaki being almost gelatinous.  So awful.  What I see from the four bags is that Perky Jerky is an inconsistent product with poor flavor.  Won't be purchasing this anymore!
1,Not a very good sauce.  Not much thicker than water and the taste was not what I consider a good tasting BBQ sauce.  I would not recommend this sauce nor will I purchase it again.
1,When I received this product, it was as if it was a fire sell product! This pasta was all broken up and as a result, as long as it has been that I purchased this product, I have yet to use it! I spent good money on it and the company won't accept returns! I still have all the unused packages of this sorry mess and I would like a full refund of the product and shipping!
1,This taste like coconut water .  I could not taste the additives at all.  It does have no added sugar but it still has 70 calories.  It has some nice trace elements and like coconut water hydrates your body.  Looking at the price I think you would be just as well served buying plain coconut water.
1,It is a taste preference. Normally I love all chocolate, including white chocolate. These, to me, were just OK....not buying them again.
1,Bigs Dill 12 packs always seem to be on back-order, so I figured instead of heading to a Sports Authority (the only retail store I KNOW has my Bigs Dill packs) again and again for too much mark up, I'd try a case of these.  While the initial flavor is OK, it wears off really fast, and if you eat sunflower seeds the proper way, by stuffing a handful into your cheeks, you'll find it's quite like what happens when you are chewing bubble gum...good at first, but quickly becomes a bland, mushy mess.  Bigs brand is WAY better.  Bigger seeds, better tasting, and the last one in a cheekful still actually tastes like dill pickle.  I think even David's might be better, and that's saying something! I've gone through 2 packs of my case of Spitz, and I've already ordered a new case of Bigs brand.  I will throw these out or give them away when the new case arrives...they are that inferior.
1,I am a little at a loss to understand the purpose of these bars. The amount of sugars in them makes them a candy bar. But they have none of the candy bar deliciousness. The coating has a weird mouth feel instead of being rich and melty like chocolate. The bar has a weird Styrofoam texture with the occasional bit of grit. And the flavor wasn't that great. The flavor left my mouth with a weird dry feeling.		I appreciate opportunities to improve my nutrition but this is not well implemented. For this amount of sugar you could have a candy bar. Just eat a salad too. It will taste better.
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS WITHOUT READING FINE PRINT.. NO RETURNS NO EXCHANGES AND DOES NOT WORK ON ALL MACHINES. THEY GOT THEIR MONEY, YOU GET SCREWED
1,The gummies themselves are great. The flavors are nice and they are soft and chewy. My issue is that the bag I recieved was not cubs. They sent the full sized gummie bears. If I wanted full sized I could have ordered that for $5 less. As these were needed for a party, there was not time to return for a different item
1,these cakes where very dry this not how this panettone is to be they are a soft moist bread like cake that is very tasty
1,Now I know. I am not a fan of microwave pork rinds.
1,Pretty awful for a Hawaiian coffee blend.  No smoothness or fullness here AT ALL!  Just a bitter, sour foretaste that is followed by a medium finish that goes nowhere.
1,I am really disappointed that they started adding MSG (soy lecithin).  The last few times I ate these I got horrible stomach cramps.  When I went back and read the ingredients I realized why. I used to really love these until they decided to add MSG.  Shame on them!
1,but my Mom did
1,I bought this tea because it was the only jasmine tea my local store carried.  I found the jasmine flavor odd, and when I looked at the Good Earth site, it failed to explain what the "flavoring" was.  I would not buy it again, and discarded it because the flavor is odd and artificial tasting.
1,To me, this form of Equal tastes nothing like the powder form available in the packets or the one-pound bulk package.  I didn't like the product at all.  It was a granular form that didn't dissolve well and didn't (to me) have the same sweetening power of the powder.
1,Has a funny taste to me. No what I thought Creole would taste like
1,These taste okay, I bought it because I thought it tastes like real fruit, but they are not. Taste just like candies you can buy anywhere on the street or at dollar store.		Does not taste like real fruit AT ALL. I will not buy again
1,While these caramel bits are a huge convenience when making caramel treats, unfortunately the flavor and texture are just not the same. The flavor is not as sweet at all and doesn't have that buttery caramel flavor. The texture seems to pull apart too easily and doesn't stretch like normal caramel.	Next time I will either make my own caramel or buy the individually wrapped caramels.
1,These noodles were very good, but my boxes had bugs in them - small, black, about half a size of a small ant.  Packaging is bad - noodles are not sealed, they're just plain in the box, coated in seasoning and all.  Any bug can get into this box and feast on tasty noodles.  I can't imagine why they made the choice not to put them at least in a sealed plastic bag inside the package. Plain noodles are ok, they're completely dry, but this product was seasoned.  For this reason I'd never buy them again.  Bugs took good 2 months to get rid of, extremely annoying in a completely bug-free home.  Now I understand why all seasoned noodles come in plastic packaging.  I had to throw out all remaining noodles.
1,Worst coffee ever.  This stuff tastes like some cheap beans were roasted to ashes and the ashes mixed with some spice to cover up the burnt flavor.  I can't imagine any coffee lover liking this.  The best use for this is fertilizing the garden.
1,The 1st shipment was of excellent quality - flavorful and the right consistancy. The 2nd shipment was tasteless and soupy as other reviewers mentioned. I can't believe that this stuff is American made. I removed 3 stars. I caught 3 rats with it out in the barn in just 3 attempts. 2 stars for the rats.
1,These waters from this brand have a very funny aftertaste.  I only drank two out of the 12 and gave the others away.
1,All of the cartons in this pack had the sealing foils already broken. How and why is this happening? I was unable to drink any of these. Really disappointing.
1,Its ok	Not the best
1,The sodium content was way too high for me to eat these-gave them away.
1,I have found that decaf coffees in general are not very tasty, but this coffee was the worst tasting one that I have had since I switched to decaf.  The claims as to how it is made sounded so good.  I even brewed it two ways - paper filter drip and French press.  Both methods produced very untasty cups of coffee.  It actually tasted like the coffee was stale or very old.  My order contained two bags, so I may try opening and brewing from the second bag one day when I have absolutely nothing else to do.
1,Great chocolate taste...but that is about as good as it gets.	Pros:	It's gluten free.	Very rich chocolate taste.	Cons:	Sticks to the inside of your mouth and teeth like a hot toasted marshmallow right off the fire.	Texture is like eating very fine sand. Chocolate flavored sand.	Gummy texture.	This mix is far better than what is out there.
1,I think I got an old batch. The cheese just didn't taste very good. Couldn't use the entire amount purchased, after a couple boxes I decided they would all likely be bad batches,
1,Was greasy and very poor cuts of bacon. I was very disappointed.
1,too thick and the flavor is not as strong as extract.
1,This says pure vanilla, but is really just artificial vanilla flavoring.  The ingredients are water, potasium sorbate, artificial flavor, and vanilla bean extractives.  Pure vanilla extract is made by macerating vanilla pods in a solution of ethyl alcohol and water.  It is naturally dark, since vanilla beans are brown.
1,this arrived real crumbly and with the edges particularly fragile.
1,Got these on Prime day for a good price.  Have a stale taste, not rancid, just stale.  Hard to distinguish much difference in taste between the different nuts.  All have the same oily taste.  Mostly almonds and cashews, only a few brazil nuts in the bag.  Expiration date is three months from this writing, so that's not the issue.  Won't be buying again.		Edit:  after a few more days it became apparent the nuts were rancid.  Amazon sending replacement, hoping they're okay.		Edit: received the replacement order from Amazon.  This shipment wasn't rancid, but the oily taste still dominated the individual flavors of the nuts.  They're okay, but compared to Planters or Kirkland, just an oily taste.  Kudos & 5 stars to Amazon for their stellar customer service, still two stars for the nuts.
1,Sugar????  Stop making tomato sauce with sugar!!!!!  The Italians don't!
1,This product arrived in a stale condition. The expiry of this product is Jan 2016, which is just 3 months from now (for a 2 Pound bag). Bought this item after reading a lot of user reviews and decided this is the one to buy although a tad expensive, not very satisfied with the purchase as I was hoping to be. I wanted to try this before I do a subscribe and save. Same experience with the Sunflower seeds I ordered from Braga.
1,Mammoth Pecan Halves?  I don't think so.  I have ordered mammoth pecans from other vendors in the past, but when I saw these, I thought that I would give them a try because I needed them right away.  They look nothing like the pictures; these were the worst.  First, they were not "Mammoth."  On the contrary; they were the size of regular pecans that one can buy in any local store.  None of them were longer then 1 inch; some were not even an inch long.  Second, they were not plump; they were a little dry.  Plus, they did not have that oily, creamy finish in the mouth.  Third, they were bland instead of "sweet."  I bought them to put out as snacks and to use in cake frosting, but ended up chopping them up for cookies.  I would not buy these again.  If I want this quality of pecan, I will go to the grocery store.  I would have rated them with "1" star, but the cookies turned out OK.
1,Nasty fake cherry flavor - couldn't finish the cup.
1,Although there were some delicious flavors, over 50% of mine were vanilla or variation of vanilla flavor which isn't my favorite. So for me, I wouldn't purchase this variety pack again because it's a limited kind of variety.
1,Coffee brand was rated highly by Consumers Reports and I bought the Columbian, Bokar Blend, and the Original.  The Original was not up to the coffee I normally purchase (Starbucks) and certainly not what I had expected.  The Columbian and Bokar blend are satisfactory, but not great.
1,Organic Coconut Cream purchased locally contains no additives or fillers and so I incorrectly assumed this would be the same. However, Native Forest Organic Premium Coconut Cream not only contains organic guar gum, it seems highly refined in that there is no thick cream, no separation between thick cream and liquid. Instead, this "cream" pours freely much like cow's milk cream. Amazon CRS was quick to address my return request.
1,The price is great and was what I used to pay for them at the store... but the "new" taste leaves a lot to be desired.  Not as sweet... Not much licorice in them.
1,I only got 11
1,Don't buy if you have  Keurig 2.0. 30 of the 40 cups will not work. they don't have the K cup logo on them and will not brew. Found out the hard way.
1,Arrived expired, not cool...
1,I did not like the coffees at all. Too weird tasting.
1,Once again I should have read the nutrition a little better before purchasing.  This may have probiotics, but drink in very small amounts... made my stomach upset..  too much sugar maybe...
1,very disappointed in this soup. it was like a creamed soup and had very little lobster in it. very mild and blah. will not order it again. I am learning to buy tried and true or make it myself. I thought it would be a treat. had no sea food taste at all
1,I made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best.  I really tried to like this product, but the taste is just so far off -- for me.  I wanted a break from making things from scratch, but this just was not worth it.
1,This is going back for credit. This candy is hard to chew and the only flavor is sugar.  DATED USE BEFOR 6/17/17 AND DELIVERED 6/25/17.	From a company in Tipperary, Ireland
1,I love popcorn, but this did not taste or smell like popcorn. It was like eating those foam packing peanuts. I've never eaten those foam packing peanuts, but I imagine that they are tasteless.		I would not purchase this product again or recommend it to anyone, unless you are buying to feed the birds.
1,Nothing special. I cant believe these cookies cost so much
1,I thought we had these previously and liked them, but this time they just seem bland and barely taste of cinnamon. We won't be buying these again. :-/
1,Has a "cooling" effect in baked good. Made cookies. You are supposed to be able to measure equally to regular sugar, but you need A LOT more of this stuff to equal the same sweetness. The cooling effect is awful!
1,Poor
1,im so mad with this!! i order some books and this tea, as an amazon prime membert they ship everything together, thats not a problema at all for me, the problema was that the can of tea was open... the seal was broken and all of the tea bags were dancing around my book, the books are drawing books and a sketching notebook...the powder that came of the tea bags got the book and the notebook stained...
1,Not a fan of the taste. The smoky flavor is more of an overpowering artificial taste rather than a rich delicious taste. The meat itself was stale.
1,Bought these because it was a different flavor but found that I do not like them. They are too sweet for me.
1,Based on all the positive reviews, I bought the sampler with great anticipation.  I was very disappointed.  If you're a gourmet coffee lover like I am, you'll find Teeccino bland and very uncoffeelike.  The chicory taste is unpleasant.  Also, it lacks the wonderful smell of coffee.  I have no doubt it is much better for you than coffee, but if you're looking to chuck your coffeemaker, save your money and buy organic cocoa or herbal tea.  In fact, I've tasted healthy herbals teas that tasted much more like coffee.
1,...not good
1,there is no such thing as coconut sugar nutive should have know this it would kill all the coconut trees .
1,No spice and tastes terrible.  What a waste of money.
1,Coffee tastes cheap.  Not very good at all.  Two bags had holes in them, coffee grounds went every where when I opened the box.
1,Description says it comes with a pump. After taking over 4 weeks to arrive at my APO address (most Amazon orders take less than a week) there was no pump in the box. I called Starbucks and they said they would send a pump out to me, but it would probably take another 4 weeks to get to me. Later on that day I received an email from them saying Amazon wouldn't allow them to send a pump because the order was already completed. Very disappointed with this transaction. This is the first time I have purchased this syrup and I think Torani syrups taste better so I will be buying that brand from now on.
1,This will not be something you purchase to eat. Almost every single one of them are disgusting. Plays a cool joke on friends and co-workers tho. But very pricy.
1,As I was making a smoothie I found mouse poo inside the bag. Returning.
1,tastes terrible
1,Didn't like. Very hard
1,2 of the cans were very dented on arrival, one so badly that it had opened and leaked all over the rest. other cans were slightly dented. will not  be ordering again
1,Did not like because the product contains genetically engineered ingrediants as described on the label. It is illegal to sell genetically engineered products in the USA. Have a nice day.
1,This is made out of soy and wheat gluten, which I didn't realize, both major allergens.  And, they're not even organic or non-GMO.
1,BEST COFFEE ON THE MARKET.  HAVE IT EVERY MORNING.  REALLY LIKE THE EASE OF USE
1,Not Gluten Free according to my reactions and my Dr plus the taste of artificial sweetener is overpowering.	I normally eat Bakery on Main Street's gluten free cereal but decided to cheap out with these. They were cheaper and I had a sweet coupon for them. They wound up in the back of my pantry for a while and I dug them out the other day. I made a bowl of this and added some pecans and butter and sat down for breakfast. My first reaction is WTH, I taste artificial sweetener! Took another bite and was wondering if I could get through with this bowl, let alone a whole case. A few minutes after eating I felt queasy to my stomach and it developed into full nausea and I found myself vomiting. During a heave I felt like I needed to poop but before I could turn around I had soiled myself and floor and wall! Mind you, I was in the middle of a heave so this is liberally mixed with the results of that heave. So here I stand in the middle of a vile mess, feeling like crap and starting to cramp. I am disoriented from the toxins and the violence of my body's purging, cramping, feeling nauseated and wanting to die. Instead I have to clean walls and floor, mop then rinse out soiled clothing and take a shower.	I guess I am the only one to blame here, I cheaped out. But if Quaker hadn't of cheaped out first and did a little testing I could have gotten away with it, maybe.
1,Only 59 pkgs were in shipment. Was supposed to be 60pack.
1,ERROR...THIS REVIEW IS NOT ABOUT THE TEA, BUT THE PARMESAN CRISPS. thank you.	This cracker deserves zero stars. I expected that for $9 (!!) these parmesan crisps would be special..spectacular for a holiday a gift basket. They are no better tasting than what one can buy for $3 or as much as $5 in the gourmet stores. What a disappointment and RIPOFF. Will not buy from the company again.
1,stale and hard as hell
1,They're not crispy/crunchy but rather soft and chewy. Costco Krikland ones are so much better.
1,Did not like flavor
1,Shelf life is terrible!  After 2 weeks, each lollipop was gummy/sticky and totally stuck to the wrappers.  And each stick came off.  I don't mind the stick issue but the gummy/sticky lollipop wasn't too appealing.  If you plan to eat the entire jar within a couple of days, they are fine.  But otherwise, stick with a basic sugar free and not this brand.  Also super dangerous for young kids... fresh or not, the stick while sucking always falls off and you end up with a huge piece of lollipop in your mouth. For adults no biggie, for kids, a choke hazard.  I do not plan to buy these again.
1,One star for not being vegan due to the ridiculous use of gelatin capsules made of cow bones. Yuck!
1,arrived on time as described good to go Pricey not to my taste won't order again
1,To me it tasted like chocolate flavored dirt.  Very grainy like dirt.  I thought I'd give it a try to see what a small (2.5 oz.) bar of 80% chocolate tasted like.  Not at all sweet, more bitter than anything..  And for $9.00, what the heck was I thinking??? I will never buy this (or 80% chocolate) again!
1,very dry flavor just okay
1,Tasted stale to me and lacked flavor . Ate small amount and then threw away
1,I have had coffee all over the world and this stuff tastes like battery acid I was completely surprised. Not as advertised
1,Flavor does not last very long.
1,I tried to learn to like the taste, but it did not happen, no matter how hard I tried.  The coffee has a strange aroma and after taste (like some sort of a strong chemical), and I have been drinking Italian espressos all my life.  After I ran out of the 4 bricks, I also stopped getting the runs and stomach pains every morning.  No more rushing to the toilet after breakfast!  I initially believed I was beginning to have unknown health problems, but after quitting this coffee, I realized that my health was fine.  For some reason it worked out terribly for me.  Espresso drinking has always been a ritual of delight for me.  Aroma, color, taste, and the feel-good-effect after drinking the coffee should all combine to bring forth a unique moment of goodness.
1,I don't normally return items, but just returned these walnuts, the bag I received was mostly small pieces and ground up particles on the bottom, if I was using these for cooking they would be fine, but was intending to eat them so I'll look for a better item even if I have to pay more.
1,This stuff was kind of disappointing:/ I really like xylitol gum, and tried this stuff but don't plan to buy it again... it doesnt last very long and makes my throat feel all crusty! Pr gum is the way to go!
1,Many of the seeds are broken, bought this for sprouting,  and the percentage of broken pieces, that are unable to sprout is too high for this purpose.
1,Rugelach was rubbery, not flakey.  Won't buy again.
1,This has more than 1500 mg of salt per the pkg.  My husband eats it but doesn't like it as much as other pho.
1,I wish this box contained what it said it did. I'm not a happy buyer. If the box were exact that would be great.
1,loaded with sugar!! WTF- isn't coconut sweet enough?
1,I don't know what happened but all of a sudden the smell & flavor has changed & it smells very chemically. Almost like burnt plastic. I made an entire huge pot of all organic homemade soup (spent like $25 on all of the vegetables, maybe more) and had to throw it out because it smelled so bad. Amazon sent me another bag of this stuff but I wasted all that money & time on cooking. I got my 2nd bag this weekend, just did the same thing & ugh!!!! It smells off & chemically again!! Im so annoyed; all that money and time wasted. I have serious food allergies & have to cook in bulk so I can have leftovers to eat through out the week & this is a huge waste! There is something wrong with this new batch of nutritional yeast!! Be ware!! I was subscribed; ordering 2 bags a month and something has changed. Its so unfortunate!!
1,Didn't do anything for me
1,I got to finish about a half of the bag when I suddenly chewed into peach pit.  I knew what it was by the bitter taste and strong "almond odor" (of cyanide). I know that one peach pit wouldn't kill me, but I didn't expect it to be in a bag of almonds.
1,An excellent, rich soup base with less salt. I'd give it 5 stars, except that the price just recently jumped more than 30%!!!!! I'm thinking twice or three times before using it now, and frankly, I may have to do without it altogether.
1,I honestly did not like the taste. It was too dry of an apple chip. My kids who were suppose to eat it won't go near the box of it.....so I have to eat myself. Usually the ones I have bought in the past from different brands are not this dry and tasteless.
1,Saying "fairly traded" and "supports 39 farms" is kind of like claiming 'organic' it doesn't mean anything unless a third party certifies that it meets certain specific standards.  For example Fair Trade farmers are paid a minimum price per pound ($1.40) that they can depend on even when the world wide price for coffee falls below that.  I suspect that this is why Camano Island can offer a full pound.  I personally don't think that real farmers should have to bear the full burden of the supermarket price wars now going on.  $1.40 for them is a survival price not a price that will make them rich.	  I would not normally submit a review to Amazon that is not about the product itself but since they insinuate that they are Fair Trade in the description and therefore hope to get you to buy on that basis I think that buyers deserve to know.
1,It was just ok.
1,doesn't taste right, it's not really like mayo at all, just looks like it. have tried to use in several different recipes and still not thrilled
1,This batch way salty! Impossible to find any good Mui anymore. I used to go to Chinatown in SF,CA in '63 and order by the ounce up to 5 types out of giant glass jars. Amazing flavors...more moist and plump than these bone dry, red stained things sold these days. They always add odd artificial sweeteners too. I think the recipes died with those older Chinese! (Like no sesame oil in won ton dumplings anymore...cheaper!)
1,I tried the product with steak fajitas and the strong flavor of the wrap made the meal not taste good.  I would not buy this again.
1,I bought this for the first time in many years thinking it would be good for dieting.  I liked Campbell's regular chicken noodle soup as a kid and thought this would be as good.  Mistake.	Yuck!  Tasteless even after I doctored it up with some seasoning.	Threw it out.
1,I didn't like this flavor at all!! Tastes like chemicals and powdered milk. Also thought I was getting a 20 pack and only got a 12 pack which is fine since I didn't like it except it made it too high in price to have even bothered with.
1,no pop, mushy, worst ever.  save your money
1,My sister and I grew up on this stuff, our whole family drank it on a regular basis. We thought it was delicious and our parents/grandparents thought it was an acceptable way to sweeten our milk. I recently moved back to Rhode Island and could not wait to et to a local grocery store and pick some up, but I was extremely disappointed to read the ingredients! It's pretty much all high fructose corn syrup...	When the the official drink of Rhode Island become total garbage?		My advice? Make your own. Heat some dark brown sugar and white sugar with very little water and add strong coffee. It literally tastes the same, but without the cheap genetically modified ingredients.		"Autocrat - Premium coffee and syrup since 1895"	I wonder when they changed their formula to include such "premium" garbage?
1,Yes, the other reviewer is absolutely correct.  The box contains 3 cans that are 3 ounces each.  I fell for the misleading description.  I was mad at myself for that.  I should have paid closer attention.
1,For the price I had to pay for it I would think that the flavor would be much better than less expensive coffees.  Too bad because I've been looking for a toffee flavored coffee for so long.  I can't even tell it's toffee flavored.
1,First of all I don't remember ordering this.  I am getting older but I don't use much shortening and can't imagine why I would have ordered such a large volume.  Second when it arrived the box was way too large so it was stuffed mostly with air pillows.  In addition the clear seal around the top was almost entirely broken and there was a thin strip of white tape stuck to various parts of the container.  There were also signs of leakage.  There were oil spots on the inside of the box and on the shipping paper that was included in the box.  I am sure this is a very good product but in view of the above issues I don't know whether to keep it, toss it or return it.  Either way I am out some money.  Wish I could be happy about this.
1,If you like Starbucks coffee, you'll like this. Too bitter/strong for my taste. Also, once you open the plastic, it's open. No resealing, ziploc feature. I'm afraid it's going to get stale quickly.
1,SodaStream is produced in illegal Israeli settlements, built on stolen Palestinian land in the militarily occupied.		The SodaStream factory employs Palestinian workers under the discriminatory and exploitative conditions of the occupation. Shame on SodaStream for flouting international law and profiting from Israels occupation of the West Bank, which is responsible for massive violations of the Palestinian peoples human, civil, and national rights.
1,These are definitely low carb and sometimes you just need a cracker, I get it. These are just fused together seeds. I would say they are very unpleasant in your mouth.
1,I didn't feel that I received fresh product.  It tasted old and I was disappointed in the quality received for the dollars invested
1,Terrible (barely)!
1,Definitely not worth buying online than in the store. Very disappointed. I ordered two bags for gift jars I was making for all my co-workers for Halloween. The candy tasted horrible and had a different appearance to it. They were not fresh at all. Next time I honestly will just go to the grocery store and buy the smaller bags.
1,I took a teaspoon with hot tea before gym hoping to boost my workout. I felt nothing so after the workout I took two more teaspoons. In a couple of hours I ended up feeling super sleepy and took a 2.5 hour nap with the TV on and roommate coming and going... It was the best nap ever, too bad I was hoping to feel energized like other reviewers said. I am returning it first day tomorrow ...
1,This oil IS refined, they don't advertise it, but if you are looking for more of an avocado taste and a high quality extra virgin avocado oil, I would look elsewhere. I prefer organic and don't like that this product isn't organic. Also, why tin? Not environmentally responsible packaging.
1,Perhaps I didn't understand what I was buying.  I thought it was a sugar substitute made from coconut.  Instead it is just coconut sugar, which I already had, and which dramatically raises my glucose levels.
1,Great water but an outrageous price at $.39 an ounce.		Elsewhere Amazon sells it for $.04 an ounce or so.		Robert C. Ross	October 2017
1,Terribly burnt oily beans.  DO NOT BUY!
1,Not what it is advertised to be.
1,stale
1,Not that great. Doesn't taste much like peach.
1,Wasn't delicious and it just as the package stated. The sauce gave me a stomach ache.
1,I didn't really care for this. I expected a less artificial flavor so this was not at all a good fit with my cup of coffee in the morning.	I was expecting something close to the taste of the nut itself and not so much like the fake puddings in the store.
1,About half of the seeds are dead and do not sprout. There are also white seeds which I had never seen before. Very poor quality
1,bad
1,Kelloggs uses GMO's in their products. GMO's have been shown in recent studies to cause Organ Failure and Massive Cancerous Tumor Growth. Boycott all their products including KASHI. Kelloggs also deceptively spent 800,000 dollars on propaganda to mislead the Californian people on the vote to Label GMOs in prop 37... GMO's for my family? NO Thanks
1,Just a different texture and flavor, did not like.
1,Not pumpkin spicey enough for us.
1,I tried to like this mayo.  I really wanted to like it because of the healthy avocado oil.  I find i need mayonnaise as part of my diet, but I want to get away from the soybean and/or canola oils found in supermarket mayonnaise.  I give it two stars because the consistency of it was very good.  Not oily like other natural mayonnaise I have tried (Spectrum).  Its just that taste, ugggghhh.  I tried it in tuna salad, devilled eggs, and mixed with dijon as the standard dip for steamed artichoke.  I taste tested the devilled eggs and artichoke dip alongside the same recipes made with Hellmann's.  There was definitely an off taste to the Avocado oil mayo, an aftertaste that I cannot like.  Even the fishiness of tuna with plenty of capers and garlic salt (don't judge) was not enough to override that off taste for me.  Since I ordered two jars, I'll give my unopened one away to a friend who is more of a hard-core natural eater than I am, and she may be more determined than I am to like this product.		Regarding the reviews where the product was arriving and it had separated into oil and chunks, mayonnaise of any sort is an emulsion and heat will cause separation.
1,higther price in other pages spend in this products 2,80$
1,I use an air popper. After I swept half the kernels off the floor, the other half that managed to land in the bowl were so tiny, they were laughable. The kernels are so small and light they blow out of the popper before they pop and when they do pop they are about 1/3 the size of the popcorn I get at my organic market (which is also certified organic and non-GMO). Won't buy this every again. A total waste of money!
1,I ordered Fee Brothers Sarsaparilla for my sodastream, based on reviews..I don;t know, but I just made it the way I usually do with syrups-added to the bottle, the taste was terrible, like medicine-I cannot drink this. Please, somebody help...
1,I added this to my Atkins diet choices and loved it.  However, today I decided to try the linquine that I'd just purchased via Subscribe & Save (10 boxes for $29.02).  While it was cooking, I thought I'd better make sure that the linguine only had 5g of digestible carbs too, since I had only had the rotini in the past.  So I looked at the box, and where previously it used to say something like, "41g carbohydrates, less 36g undigestible carbohydrates, 5g net carbs," there was absolutely nothing.  Simply 41g carbs in the nutrition info box.  So I asked the internet, and it turns out that the claims related to undigestible carbs were a bunch of hooey.  Dreamfields settled a class action lawsuit on the matter earlier this year.		It's unsettling that this happened months ago and I was entirely unaware of it.  Somehow the news story missed my radar entirely.  Or it was "underreported," as those savvy marketing folks would say.		Don't eat this is if you're trying to do Atkins.  One serving is 2 days worth of carbs (at least in Phase I.)
1,Total ripoff. Arrived with 7.49 price sticker
1,threw it out	the whole box was old, stale and inedible
1,Meh. Not so good. Rather tasteless with significant calories.
1,Has an odd flavor and terrible aftertaste. Big chunks of fat and tissue added to my dissatisfaction. with this item. But that taste - YUK.
1,This coffee has very little flavor. Tastes like a very very mild blend of coffee. I would not purchase again.
1,Dry and sour.
1,Tasteless.  Don't like it.
1,It seems to lack "body".		I found it quite vinegary and "watery" instead of having the robust, sweet-sour, almost "thick" sensation I've found in high quality balsamic vinegars.		It's risky to order food/gourmet items on line.  I'm realizing that I need to be able to sample products such as this before buying.		Basically, it's disappointing and not worth more than the less-than-$7.00 I paid for it.
1,Ordered 24 oz beans, received 15 oz grinds.  Amazon screw-up.
1,I received a box of these free with a free Friday download coupon at the local grocery store.  I'm glad I didn't pay anything for them.  I really thought I would love these, because I eat a lot of brown rice, and I usually love the flavors used in these.  However, I was disappointed.  First of all, they are not what I envisioned as a thin cracker.  These are puffy, not thin, and although they are crisp, they are not crisp like a thin, baked cracker usually is.  Then there is the flavor.  All I can say is that my first impression was that they'd been soaked in some kind of industrial cleaner.  Ugh!  I went back to them a few times, and they grew on me a little bit, but not much.  I looked at the other available flavors, and I wish those had been on the shelves at my grocery store.  Sour cream and chive, for example, may have been much tastier.  As it is, I would never, ever buy these again.  I might try another flavor, even though the "thin crisp" part is misleading.  Possibly, if you're prepared to serve these WITH something, like a dip or a cheese, they might come across better, but you shouldn't need to do that with a flavorful cracker.
1,Oh man. The taste is awful. It left an unbearable aftertaste and a film over my teeth after drinking. I would not recommend.
1,We really tried to drink it. But we just couldn't. We didn't even like the smell of it, it's very strong. Thankfully we only had one teabag in a sampler pack. I guess this is an acquired taste? I thought I had a pretty forgiving palate, but in a world where teas are normally very subtle in flavors and just hint at essences of this or that, this tea just smacks you in the face with a very sour rind of dried lime. If you like that sort of thing, then this is your tea. It's not ours. We never use honey or sweeteners, it might have been a bit better if sweetened, but still not good enough to drink for us.
1,Where did Coffee Bean Direct get this tea from?  I have never had a Darjeeling tea that tasted this bad.  If you add enough tea to your steep to get some flavor, you get a lot of bitterness.  If you add less tea you don't get the bitterness but you don't get the flavor either.  I can't believe that anyone would enjoy drinking this tea.  This purchase was a total waste of money for me.  Even Lipton Brand Black Tea is far superior in taste to this product. Darjeeling is often referred to as the "Champagne" of teas.  This Darjeeling could be referred to as the "Beer" (bitter) of teas.
1,this coffee is horrible , it doesn't smell right. I have been trying to find out how to get a refund. could you please do that????????
1,I love that it's organic and fair trade. But that's the 2 stars. It's flavor is lacking and that is straight out of the can. Going to try and separate and taste again. I'll edit the review if it gets better.
1,Stale, hard to chew, can't blow bubbles, sticks to the wrapper.
1,Am I the only one whose LDL Cholesterol has gone UP since taking this?  Had two doctors put me on statins which I cannot take due to being an RA patient.  My total cholesterol went up to 244 and finally my rheumatologist figured out it was this coconut oil.  I looked into it, and sure enough, even though this product CLAIMS to be good for cholesterol, I found many articles that state coconut oil is NOT good for cholesterol.  In my case it was disastrous and this is going in the trash. Please if you are taking this product, keep an eye on your cholesterol numbers.  Statins are not good for you so avoid them at all cost!!
1,I like this gojuchang about as much as other brands I have purchased at a local Asian market, but all the othets cost between 3 and 4 dollars, this one is ten bucks, a 300 percent increase.  Would you buy a Camry for 96,000 dollars?  I could understand an extra dollar, but triple the price?  The main difference seems to be that this company is marketing this with english on the label.  They claim that they have great water nearby,  but the main ingredient is corn syrup, not water.  Maybe that area is known for great corn syrup?  I am attaching photos of a jug of made in Korea Gojuchang I bought for just over three bucks, after I had paid ten for this one.
1,These lemon sandwich cookies look so pretty, but the actually taste is on the bland side. The cookies are harder than other sandwich cookies I've enjoyed. There isn't nearly enough lemon cream filling and it's a diluted hint of artificial lemon. Too bad these don't have a bold lemon zest flavor.		Like their coconut "El Duende" version, the cheap packaging splits down the front soon after opening. For this reason, I place them into airtight mason jars to preserve freshness for my teenage son who eats anything.
1,TOO SMALL  AND IS JUST THE BRIDE
1,Too sweet!
1,Not terrible, but high in fat, low in flavor.
1,I didn't care for these, they don't have the sweet taste that I like about regular wheat thins.	Also kind of extra dry when eating them.
1,Wow. I was really hoping to like this. It tasted like cheese and.....chalk? I don't know. But it was very gross. So my friends and I just used it as a prank on the other soldiers making it seem like it was delicious so they would eat it. It was actually very entertaining.
1,Im sure this item is very good, but the primary, most distinctive flavor is odd to me and over-powering. It was fresh; its just not for me.
1,Package was already cut open.
1,I gave it a try.  It is brownish green in color.  It smelled and tasted awful.  I'm going to stick to domatcha.  I'll be returning this item.
